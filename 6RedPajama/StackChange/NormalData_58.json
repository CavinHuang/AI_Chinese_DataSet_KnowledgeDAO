["Q: How can I install apps onto an iPad with iOS 5? I have a jailbroken iPad 1 (running iOS 5.1.1), and I would like to install some free apps on it (namely YouTube). Unfortunately the App Store won’t let me install most apps on such an old device. \nIs there any way to work around this limitation and install an older version of those apps that would be compatible with my iPad and iOS 5?\n\nA: There is an absolutely legal way to do what i want.

I then deleted and installed whatsapp several times where each time I would open Xdownloader, click on the .ipa file, and choose to open it using \"AppCake\" in which I would get the option to install popping up right away. \nThen I noticed that the free space dropped to about 300 megabytes! I can only presume that AppCake unzips the .ipa file to some temp folder and installs from it but doesn't delete it after the installation process completes!

It was serving me well for years, until I started to use it on a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. I added the \"Change Input Language\" button to the Touch Bar's Control Strip and whenever I press it, the language is switched. It worked fine for weeks, but suddenly it is just not switching from the Touch Bar. But it does switch from the top menu bar and keyboard.\nNow some technical details. I've tried to use both a .keylayout file as well as bundle file. I've tried to install it both in /Library/... and in ~/Library/.... When the problem appears, it's not easy to recover it, even with reboots. Removing/adding my custom layout again doesn't work most of the time. The Touch Bar does switch using built-in languages.\nI've contacted the developer of Ukelele, but he couldn't test it due to not having a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and had no clue.\nSo I looked into logs and found a Touch Bar crash:\nJul 23 21:45:17 xxxx com.apple.DFRSystemExtra.InputMenu[763]: objc[763]: Class TIMLog is implemented in both /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/TextInput.menu/Contents/SharedFrameworks/TextInputUI.framework/Versions/A/TextInputUI (0x102c88858) and /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlStrip.app/Contents/XPCServices/com.apple.DFRSystemExtra.InputMenu.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.DFRSystemExtra.InputMenu (0x102c64958).

I haven't found a way in Ukelele to make my custom layout show a 2 letter language abbreviation—maybe someone can suggest a way that I can try. So my guess is that it happens due to the custom layout icon, but it was copied from a built-in layout.\n\nA: I'm using the Bépo layout and I was experiencing the same issue.\nI recreated the .icns file using the iconutil command. I just provided the 16x16, 16x16@2x and 32x32 icons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder named <your_layout>.iconset\n\n*Put your icons inside.

My mum received a piece of spam, that could not be deleted or moved on her iPad using the mail app. It was only removed after deleting the account within the mail app, and recreating it.\nQuestion:\nIs it possible to send an email that can't be deleted from the mail app?\nDetails\nMy mum received a spam email claiming to offer $500 at Sainsbury's (yes, $$ at a UK supermarket!). After opening the email on her ipad (with image loading turned on) she recognised this as an obvious scam and touched the \"trash\" icon to delete.\nThe email appeared to be deleted, (the animation showing the email moving to trash ran and the email went from her inbox). However the email was not moved to trash, and after restarting mail, the scam email was still in her inbox. She subsequently received several more spam emails (offering viagra etc), and all further attempts to delete the original email produced a dialog \"Unable to delete this email [OK]\". (the later spam emails could be deleted as normal, she had not previously had a problem with spam on this email address)\nThe email was sent through her ISP's IMAP server (talktalk). When she logged into the same email account on a windows PC the original spam email was not on the server.\nShe then asked me to help her sort this problem. I turned off image loading. Then I tried to move the spam email to \"Junk\", again it appeared to move but after restarting the mail app, it was back.\nNext, I followed the instructions given at https://forgetcomputers.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201010530-Can-t-Delete-Email-from-iPad-or-iPhone- (to check the \"On the server\" next to the folders in the account view of mail settings). This did not solve the problem. The line \"on the server\" was already checked and I changed no setting. The email could not be deleted or moved to junk\nFollowing another forum thread, I also tried setting the email as \"unread\". This had no effect, except marking the spam email as unread.\nI then deleted her account in settings>mail, and created a new account (with the same email address) When she connected to the new account, the spam email was gone. So I hope the prime issue is now resolved.\n\nA: If your mum can't delete the mail after restarting or disconnecting from the network and restarting, you can look at one of two\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the mails using a webmail interface and then delete the account from the iPad. \n\n*Then contact your ISP/Mail provider if the mail syncs down after you have cleared it from webmail. \n\n\nIf you can't delete the mail off webmail - then it's 100% on the server side so contact them in that case, too. \nGood luck - you can expect dozens more emails about viagra and more since there's no signs that the hard work that will need to be done to eliminate spam / abusive / promotional / malware laden emails will ever be funded by free email services. Also good news, if this was on a computer, you’d also probably need to remove malware from the computer as that’s usually the end result of these spammy/sticky emails. \n", "Q: Cannot exit fullscreen and cannot interact with fullscreen applications macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F2073)\nOn my Mac whenever any application (chrome, spotify, slack, etc...) enters full screen mode I cannot exit or interact with the application in any way.\n\n\n*\n\n*option+F11 does not result in any change\n\n*option+F10 does not result in any change\n\n*option+F9 does not result in any change\n\n*option+F8 does not result in any change\n\n*command+F does not result in any change\n\n*command+shift+F does not result in any change\n\n*command+control+F does not result in any change\n\n*Mousing to the very top of the entire monitor reveals a menu bar which does not respond to being clicked\n\n*Window control buttons (red, yellow, green - top left corner of the window) do not respond to being clicked.\n\n*command+W does not result in the window closing\n\n*If an application supports multiple windows (eg: chrome may have multiple windows with tabs inside of them), I can move the window around but I cannot interact with anything regarding the application (all of the above also applies to this sort of window).\n\n\nI can only close the application via things like pkill -9 '<process-name>' at the command line.\nMy question:- How can I troubleshoot this further as I'd love to be able to use full screen mode.\n\nA: Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires patience.\nThe first thing I would do is to test whether this behaviour is replicated in Safe Mode.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. is the issue still present, etc)\n\n*Now exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Once logged in again, test to see whether the behaviour continues\n\n\nWhen you're finished let me know how you went and we'll go from there.\n\nIf you find that you don't have the problem in Safe Mode, but still do after logging in normally again, then it's time to investigate login items, fonts, and kernel extensions\nInvestigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions\nLet's start with Login Items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup normally\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Take a note of your Login Items \n\n*Now remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the - button below\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n\nNow your Mac will boot up without those login items loading.

I've been a Mac user for a while, and I was really upset about the removal of the startup sounds in the new MacBooks post-2016.

If I tell Siri \"email me,\" the right thing happens: a new message is created with my email address as the recipient. But if I open the email app and type \"me\" as the recipient, I'm told \"Invalid Address\" when I try to send the message.\nHow can I get the email app to understand that \"me\" as a recipient means to use the email address corresponding to who I've told Siri is me?\n\nA: You can't.\nBecause of the design of iOS, there is no native way to accomplish this. The reason for this is that the address field in mail and messages are almost exactly identical, not just in looks, but in function.\nIn messages, you can actually send a text to me, but it will send whatever you said straight to 63 (see number pad). This is because some companies hand out shortcodes, and say something like Text APP to WMART (96278) to download the Walmart app!. users can either punch in 96278 into messages, or they can punch in the much more memorable WMART into the address field and still have the message go back to the right place.\nNow, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that mail will actually try to send an email to me if you hit send. This may be a planned feature for within organizations or something, or it could be an oversight. But due to the design of iOS, you are unable to accomplish what you wanted.\n\nA: You need to put on your full email address in the \"to\" address bar\nthe above answer is Right in some point.The Application will try to send the mail to me,if you really want to send by typing me then you should try saving your own mail address with the name of mee and then you can try(not confirmed but i am 90% sure it will work)\nand siri will send to ur mailbox cause u have saved your email address in there so it will automatically redirect there.\nSo you need to save your own mail address n u can try or can write down the full mail address\n", "Q: Can I bulk move local messages and folders to a server? I'm helping a friend migrate his email off of a Macbook and onto an imap server. I've created an imap account on a server to hold the emails.\nIs there a way to bulk-copy the contents of local folders (\"On My Mac\") to the imap server? My friend has folders within folders. Something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*House\n\n\n*\n\n*message\n\n*message\n\n*message\n\n*Plumbing\n\n\n*\n\n*message\n\n*message\n\n*Bills\n\n\n*\n\n*message\n\n\n*message\n\n\n*Electrical\n\n\n*\n\n*message\n\n*message\n\n\n\n*Vacation\n\n\n*\n\n*message\n\n*message\n\n*Schedules\n\n\n*\n\n*message\n\n*message\n\n\n\n*Jokes\n\n\n*\n\n*message\n\n*message\n\n\n\nand so forth. Probably around 50 top-level folders and I have no idea how many subfolders. 2G of email total.\nI want to bulk-copy the entire lot to a server so he can access them from his iPad instead. Let's assume he won't be accessing the local folders on his Mac once we get this figured out.\nCan this be done, or are we doomed to create the folders one by one and then copy the individual emails?\n\nMore information as I experimented:\nThe server is Dovecot\nI was transferring folders to the server by simply dragging them within Mail.app. This worked fine in most cases.\nSome piece of software in the chain doesn't like dots in folder names, so the folder \"Dr.Who\" got changed to \"Dr\" with the subfolder \" Who\" and then errors occurred. After I spent some time searching for folders with '.' in their names, and renaming them, things went better.\nSometimes when I dragged a folder that contained both messages and subfolders, it went smoothly. Sometimes the top-level folder would be empty and would not allow messages to be stored in it. When that happened, I could look around and find the folder named \"folder (Messages)\" which contained the missing messages. I would then be able to recombine the two folders and rename and I'd be good.\nMail.app really needs a \"sort folders alphabetically\" function. I found that I could do this manually by quitting Mail, deleting .mboxCache.plist, and restarting Mail.\nThe imap-upload tool would have been perfect for my needs if it had worked. I might look into debugging it.\nI'll leave the question open for a while to see if anybody finds a real answer.\n\nOne more data point: as an experiment, I tried creating the subfolder \"Dr. Who\" from Thunderbird instead of Mail.app. It created the folder \"Dr\" with the subfolder \" Who\". I believe Mail.app uses dots as subfolder specifiers when talking to an IMAP server, but uses slashes for folders on the local system. Thus, a folder name with a dot in it is perfectly acceptable for a local folder, it causes issues when pushed to an IMAP server.\n\nA: Informational post.\nSo … I've been reading up on the IMAP protocol. It seems to me that IMAP doesn't really have a formal concept of subfolders. If you want to name one mailbox \"House\" and another one \"House.Plumbing\", that's entirely up to you. It just happens that Mail.app, and probably many other email clients choose to present these folders to you in a hierarchical form.\nThat also explains why I encountered some higher-level folders that wouldn't accept any messages — if you were to create, e.g. \"House.Plumbing\" but not \"House\", Mail.app would show you the un-writable virtual folder \"House\" with the subfolder \"Plumbing\". But as far as the IMAP server is concerned, it's just a folder named \"House.Plumbing\".\n(This isn't to say that the IMAP server itself won't store the folders in a hierarchical way, but the standard doesn't say either way, AFAIK.)\n\nA: Final post: Well, for the record, I just gave up and wrote my own imap client in Python to do the job. It can download and upload any hierarchy of mailboxes from/to a Dovecot server. It should work with any server, but I haven't tested it on others. Thought I would share it.\nIt worked for my needs. If you use it yourself, and run into a snag, feel free to contact me and maybe I can debug the issue.

What you wrote in your question is correct, but if you had the source and the target the wrong way round when you typed the link command, you could have clobbered the executable. You could also have cobbered the executable if you ran the linking command while in the  ...3.5/bin directory.\nCheck that the executable still looks right with \nls -l /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3.5\n\nIf you have accidentally clobbered it then re-installing is probably the easiest fix. \nUsing the -f flag is potentially dangerous, since it will replace files without warning.

I'm using macOS Sierra 10.12.6 behind a corporate NTLM proxy. My browser and other applications are using the system proxy settings, in which I have saved my username and password for authenticating with the proxy. This is working fine.\nThere is a persistent problem with system services that try to access information on the internet and don't see to have access to the proxy credentials in my user account. I see the following popup every couple of minutes, and whatever I do (updating my credentials in System Preferences, or pressing \"Not Now\"), the popup keeps coming up again and again:\n\nThe text in the popup reads:\n\nProxy Authentication Required\nEnter the password for the HTTP proxy http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:yyyy in System Preferences.\n\nWhat can I do to stop this popup from appearing?\nThings I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updated my credentials in System Preferences (Network > Advanced > Proxy)\n\n*Copied the credentials entries from my login keychain to the System keychain, since I read a recommendation for that in a blog post or forum question.\n\n\nNone of these has worked, I get this popup every couple of minutes, and there does not seem to be a pattern to when it shows up.\nUpdate 1:\nAs soon as I enter my credentials by clicking the System Preferences button in the above dialog (which I can force by e.g. opening Safari and starting to type a URL in the location box), two records are created in the login keychain, both with identical content:\n\n@ xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (username)    Internet Password     Today, 09:10    --    login\n\nBoth records look identical, with the same name and attributes. Both show that the application that requested this is AuthBrokerAgent:\n\nUpdate 2:\nI've also tried this suggestion: https://discussions.apple.com/message/23848961#message23848961, copying the authentication entries from the login keychain to the system keychain and then rebooting, but it did not fix it. In fact, the dreaded \"Proxy Authentication Required\" box showed up again while typing this...\nUpdate 3:\nI've used Wireshark to take a look at the traffic between my machine and our proxy: \n\n\n*\n\n*The proxy returns with a 407 Proxy Authentication Required and Proxy-Authenticate: NTLM, which is in line with my expectation, since our proxy uses NTLM.\n\n*Some examples I've seen in the traffic (e.g. iCloud) then send back an NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE response.\n\n*The proxy comes back with an NTLMSSP_CHALLENGE request\n\n*The service responds with NTLMSSP_AUTH and my username, which it must have gotten from somewhere.\n\n*The proxy finally responds with a 200 Connection established\nTo me, this shows that in general the proxy authentication works fine, if the system can get the username and proxy from somewhere. The question remains how/where to store the username/password so that all system services can find it. Some system services (I assume) don't have any means to find the proxy credentials where I'm currently storing them.\n\nA: This is most likely expected behavior if your system/network administrator has configured the proxy force authentication that requires more than just a basic authentication scheme.\nFrom Microsoft's page Handling Authentication under About HTTP Authentication section:\n\nThere are two general types of authentication schemes:\n\n*\n\n*Basic authentication scheme, where the user name and password are sent in\ncleartext to the server.\n\n*Challenge-response schemes, which allow for a\nchallenge-response format.\n\nChallenge-response schemes enable more secure authentication. If a\nrequest requires authentication using a challenge-response scheme, the\nappropriate status code and Authenticate headers are returned to the\nclient. The client must then to resend the request with a negotiate.\nThe server would return an appropriate status code with a challenge,\nand the client would then require to resend the request with the\nproper response to get the requested service.\n\nIf the proxy you are using utilizes the basic authentication scheme, what's saved in your keychain will suffice to authenticate you.  If a challenge response scheme is being used, you will most likely have to provide more info - in this case - re-enter your password - to authenticate; and this is what you are seeing.\nNTLM Authentication Process\nThis is much more than just storing credentials.  The client must generate a response based upon a generated request from the server.  Following is a very abridged description of the authentication process from the client/server perspective per  Microsoft's documentation\n\n\n*\n\n*The client sends the user name to the server (in plaintext).\n\n\n*The server generates a 16-byte random number, called a challenge or nonce, and sends it to the client.\n\n\n*The client encrypts this challenge with the hash of the user's password and returns the result to the server. This is called the\nresponse.\n\n\n*The server sends the following three items to the domain controller:\n\n*\n\n*User name\n\n*Challenge sent to the client\n\n*Response received from the client\n\n\n\n*The DC validates the encrypted challenge and response.  If authenticated, access is granted.\n\nThe third step above, requires the client to hash a random number it got from the server.  This inherently means there's nothing to be stored on your macOS client.\nAt a very minimum, you need to be joined the Active Directory domain.  This means you need Kerberos support enabled and configured properly for your specific organization.\nThere's a key phrase in the \"Handling Authentication\" document I linked above:\n\nIf authentication is required, the INTERNET_FLAG_KEEP_CONNECTION flag\nshould be used in the call to HttpOpenRequest. The\nINTERNET_FLAG_KEEP_CONNECTION flag is required for NTLM and other\ntypes of authentication in order to maintain the connection while\ncompleting the authentication process. If the connection is not\nmaintained, the authentication process must be restarted with the\nproxy or server.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\nBased on your the symptoms being presented it appears that your organization requires authentication to the proxy; your username/password are valid, but it keeps (re)asking for authentication.  It's probably because you are losing the connection state and having to do this all over again.  Which further emphasizes the point....\nTo solve this issue, you will need to contact your network admin to assist you with the authentication issues.\n\nA: \nby authention of  key chain app  modify setting\n\nA: Run the following command from Console.app:\nnetworksetup -setwebproxy \"Your Interface Name\" \"web proxy hostname or IP\" \n8080 on username password\n\nYou will be asked about keychain access. Agree to add the record into keychain and you will have an access without the password all the time when your keychain is open.\n", "Q: Syncing files not in Desktop / Documents via iCloud I have a folder containing scripts and files they operate on in a root folder /data.

Is there a way to do this? \nI use macOS Sierra Version 10.12.4. Thanks!\n\nA: I've come up with two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Google's Backup-and-Sync app, which allows you to select which folders to automatically sync with Google Drive (this doesn't use iCloud through)\n\n*Using cron, a MacOS / Linux command-line program, to automatically rsync your directory outside of iCloud path and its copy in the iCloud folder. \n\n", "Q: Load MacBook Air back-up on MacBook 2017 I've recently purchased a MacBook 12' 2017 and would like to restore it with a TimeMachine back-up of my previous MacBook Air 13' 2014.

I received a Live Photo in the form of a JPEG and MOV files. How do I combine the two into a proper Live Photo that I can use on my lock screen?\n\nA: Have you tried adding both files to Photos on a Mac? In a quick test I did, Photos (v2.0) seems to recognize that the files belong together and shows them as a single Live Photo. I found you don't even have to add the files at the same time for this to work. The test I did involved simply taking a Live Photo on my iPhone, copying it to my Mac using Image Capture (which results in a separate JPG and MOV file), and then importing these files into Photos.\nA few caveats though:\n\n\n*\n\n*I’m not sure how Photos recognizes that the files belong together. Presumably this is based on some piece of metadata in the files. If the files you received have been processed in any way, this piece of metadata may have been lost.\n\n*In my quick test, I only got this to work with Photos on Mac. I also tried this with Photos on my iPad (iOS 10.3.3), but I wound up with a photo and a movie, rather than a single Live Photo. Once you have the two files on a Mac as a single Live Photo though, you should be able to transfer it as such to an iOS device using AirDrop or some other means like iCloud Photo Sharing.\n\n", "Q: How can I export .mobileconfig file from IOS10 to Mac?

The rest of the iPhone looks sealed. If I put tape over the speakers and charging port, will that be enough waterproof my iPhone 7 Plus? Are there any other \"holes\" in the iPhone?\n\nA: The iPhone 7 Plus is splash, water, and dust resistant and has a IP67 rating under IEC standard 60529. Which means up to 30 minutes under water at up to 3 feet deep. \nIf you are not submersing your iPhone 7 in more than 3 feet of water for more than 30 minutes you shouldn't need to do any additional waterproofing. However even though the iPhone 7 Plus is has a water resistant rating, water damage is not covered under warranty. You should also note that Apple has specific instructions for drying out a wet phone. See this Apple Support page for all of the details.\nPersonally, I would invest in a waterproof case to protect a device that costs at least $869, especially if I was planning on exposing it to salt water.\nMany \"field\" tests have been done and the iPhone appears to exceed this rating when new. If you google around a bit you can find videos of iPhone 7 immersion test videos.\nHere's a quote from Apple's official iPhone 7 page:\n\niPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP67 under IEC standard 60529. Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear.

As the resolutions are common with multiple devices (ie. iPhone 6 = 6s = 7) it is unnecessary to list them all. You could think of it as a visual preview.\nThe device list next to Play/Stop is the actual simulator selector list and choosing one will fire up an actual simulator when running.\n", "Q: How can I view the current price of an app I've previously purchased?

I'm trying to save three distinct variables that my Applescript application would then be able to access on launch, and if the user wishes to he may manipulate those variables from within the application.\nMore specifically, I'm working on a script that runs a bunch of equations based on a user's selected latitude and longitude, and outputs the results in a string, including the city's name. If the user wishes to, he may choose a different city and restart the script based on that city.\nChoosing a different city, setting the variables, and rerunning the script accordingly is fine. I can just set up a subroutine containing the following code:\nset choice to choose from list {\"City A\",\"City B\",\"City X\"}\nif choice is \"City A\"\n    set city to \"City A\"\n    set lat to (latitude of City A)\n    set lon to (longitude of City A)\nelse if choice is \"City B\"\n...\n\nMy problem is that I have to initialize these variables when the script starts. I can set a predefined value for these variables, or I can run this subroutine at the beginning of the script, but I can't find a way to save the choice for future runs, so that the result of this choice becomes the default. That is, if the script by default runs these equations for City A, and I pick City B from the list, the next time the script runs, it should run the equations for City B automatically, without any user input.\nI tried setting up a second script with exactly three lines of code:\nproperty city : \"City A\"\nproperty longitude : (longitude of City A)\nproperty latitude : (latitude of City A)\n\nbut subsequently realized that it fails for exactly the same problem: Applescripts can't save variables inside themselves between tasks. I can update an external variable once it's loaded into the current script, but that doesn't actually edit the original script.\nAnother thing I tried was creating a blank file somewhere and rename it according to the user's choice, then testing for the file's name and updating the variables accordingly, but I'd also like to share the application for others to be able to use, and that would require them to also have this file in a specific folder. For some reason, Script Editor doesn't like it when I try getting the file path of a file inside an application package, so unless there's a fix for that, I can't just hide the file inside the application itself.\nI've seen here that if you save the file as .applescript you can have it write onto itself, but I'm unsure of how you would go about doing that.\nI am aware that there is a thing called Database Events that I could possibly manipulate, but I'm not sure of how I would go about doing that.\nThe minimum I'm looking for is a way to save variables to access them on launch next time, but if someone could address all of the possibilities I've mentioned above, that would be excellent.\n\nA: Add a property declaration at the start of your script. Changes to that property during the execution of your script will be saved and available the next time you execute.\n\nThe value set by a property definition is not reset each time the script is run; instead, it persists until the script is recompiled.

I have 6,000 songs in my iTunes library and signed up for the Apple Music 3-month trial a while back when it was first offered, including iCloud Music Library.\nAfter matching, about 3,000 of them are marked 'Apple Music' in the 'iCloud Status' column. \nThis is improper, as most of these were ripped from cds I own, and hundreds of them are actual live recordings I made myself (rehearsal recordings; I'm a songwriter).\nObviously, this is a problem on my iOS devices; they play different songs.\nBut I'm also concerned about what happens if I cancel my subscription. I've read that songs you've added from the Apple Music service will disappear. Obviously, I don't want my own songwriting recordings to disappear, but I worry they might since they are improperly marked 'Apple Music'. I have them backed up in time machine and elsewhere, but it would still be a huge hassle to audit the results, discover what is and isn't deleted, and add them back in.\nI guess my question is twofold:\n\n\n*\n\n*What happens to songs that are improperly marked 'Apple Music' if you cancel your subscription? If I choose to cancel, what is the best way to ensure all my recordings remain?\n\n*If I choose to stay subscribed, for songs that are improperly marked 'Apple Music' and should be 'Uploaded' instead, how can this be repaired? (I've been reluctant to pick 'Update iCloud Music Library' because of all the warnings to back up your library first - is this safe in my case?) What is the best way to repair my library?\n\nA: Figured I'd answer my own question. I made two attempts to contact Apple Support and another attempt to post to Apple Discussions, with no results. \nSo I copied my entire iTunes library to a backup disk, and did my best at keeping notes at how many songs I had, which were what status, etc. I knew if things went south, I'd have quite a project in figuring out what songs to restore, but couldn't think of another alternative.\nAfter I finished backing up, I loaded my original desktop iTunes library, and picked \"Update iCloud Music Library\".\nIt took about 90 minutes for 6,177 tracks, first analyzing music, and then uploading to iCloud. And the end result is that it looks like it resolved matters perfectly.\nI've seen other articles from the past indicating that \"Update iCloud Music Library\" only led to partial success, and led to people doing long involved processes like opening a new library, deleting all their tracks there, and then going back to their original one to re-analyze and download, but to me that seems more error-prone and unnecessary.\nBrief stats: Before I did the update, I had:\nApple Music: 2912\nUploaded: 2486\nMatched: 8\n\nAfter the update, I had:\nApple Music: 43\nUploaded: 3135\nMatched: 2228\n\nThe rest of my songs stayed consistent in status (Purchased, Ineligible, No Longer Available, Waiting, Error). So far I don't see any songs that are improperly categorized, and all of my personal recordings are properly Uploaded.\nI still don't know what would have happened if I had canceled, but matters seem improved now.\n", "Q: Identifying what PowerMac I have I'm having issues identifying what type of PowerMac G4 Quicksilver I have.\nLooking at the stickers on the machine, I initially come to the conclusion that the machine is a Power Macintosh G4 800 DP (Quicksilver)800 MHz PowerPC 7450 (G4) x2 (that's taken from everymac.com) however when going to About This Mac the machine shows it only has one processor, making me think its a Power Macintosh G4 800 (QS 2002)800 MHz PowerPC 7455* (G4). The case itself has these two notes:\n\n\nIn the first of the two it is clear that the case is copyrighted 2001, but in the second it only seems to specify one processor. Since I got this machine second hand and don't know its history, I have considered the fact the logic board or the CPU board may have been replaced. Still I am not sure exactly what machine I have.\nWhy does all of this even matter? I want to be able to start the machine up with a universal OS9 install, however the 2002 Quicksilver apparently doesn't allow this, and has to be installed from original install discs. I have wheat I believe are the correct discs coincidentally, and OS9 installed fine, however hangs upon a successful boot, unless extensions are disabled.\nI really don't know what this machine is, and how I can find out. I have not started up the Apple Hardware Test CD I also have, so if you'd like me to do so and maybe get some info from its report please do ask. I don't even know if it will start up. I'll update this once I have tested it.\nThank you for any replies.\n\nA: The Mac in question is a Power Macintosh G4 800 (QuickSilver 2002) model built in June 2002. In your case, it has the 800 MHz PowerPC 7455 G4 processor (as opposed to the PowerPC 7450 variant). This processor had a single core, but also had what Apple called an AltiVec Velocity Engine. \nThe specific model details are: M8493 (EMC 1896) with model identifier PowerMac3,5. \nIn your question you mentioned Mac OS 9.

I have a 4TB WD MyPassport for Mac and I was planning on partitioning it so I could have half of it to use as a Time Machine and the other half for storage. So, I naturally thought I would reformat the drive as APFS and then partition it so everything is in the same format as my internal hard drive. However, once it was in the APFS format and in the partition drop-down, everything was grayed out from the plus/minus buttons to the resize text box. Down below where they normally display the errors it only said that \"This volume cannot be resized.\" I did also run into the issue where I thought that I would just reformat it back to Mac OS Extended (Journaled) (AKA: JHFS+). In the drop-down for the Erase menu, I was only given the four APFS options as the format. So, being the hard-head I am, I went into terminal and used the \"diskutil eraseDisk\" option to reformat it to JHFS+, which worked. From there I was able to partition it off and reformat one volume to APFS for Time Machine and use the other for extra storage. What I learned after setting up Time Machine, is that it actually needs to be in the JHFS+ format to work. TL;DR So, I guess my question ends up being: does anyone know why I can't partition a drive that is in APFS format? And why does Time Machine use JHFS+ format if the new native format is APFS? As far as the first question, is it just me or maybe because High Sierra is in Beta and it's just something that hasn't been fixed? And for the second, also maybe because it's in Beta and it's just something that hasn't been updated?\nThank you for everyone's time reading this, I know it was kind of a long one.\n\n\n\nA: I'm no APFS expert but my understanding is that once the whole HD is formatted as APFS it becomes a \"container\" that can hold multiple volumes.  You can add volumes (partitions) to the container but they all share the entire space of the container and resize themselves dynamically.  Therefore there is no option to resize a partition or volume in disk utility. The file system takes care of it automatically.\n\nA: I haven't figured out why it wouldn't let me partition my drive formatted as APFS, but I am assuming it is because of beta bugs. I am able to do it now so that's the only logical answer. As far as Time Machine goes, I noticed that it was requiring me to format the drive as OS X Journaled even though the original is APFS... It doesn't really make sense to me but I'm not an expert. So, for Time Machine, it still needs to be OS X Journaled; and for partitioning it appears to be fixed.

Uploading of Desktop and Documents to iCloud hasn't worked for me for months (macOS 10.12).\nI have now started from scratch with a brand-new install, and am trying to sync just ~70MB of files that are sitting on the desktop.\nIt's been stuck on \"77.8MB of 77.8MB\" for 3 days. \nWhy does this happen, and how can I fix it?\nI've looked at possible solutions (like logging out etc.), but this is a fresh install, shouldn't it just work?\n\nA: All programs are supposed to “just work”, however bugs are unavoidable when humans are programming.\nWith a brand new install it seems that logging out or rebooting the Mac to test if this fixes the problem shouldn't be a problem.

Then DP to DP from first U2417H to second U2417H. Is this possible? The display is not 4k.\nEdit: I realize this question might have been asked, but the one I have found is asking about 4k.\n\nA: Your MacBook Air's hardware: Yes.\nMacOS (as tested with macOS Sierra 10.12.6): No.\nI've tested it myself with an older MST capable Dell monitor and found various forum entries about this topic. No chance with macOS.\nThe Intel HD5000 graphics chip on your Macbook is capable to do MST with DP 1.2.\nMacOS does not have any MST support built in. There is a 1% chance it will work with High Sierra 10.13 (if somebody can test this?!) but I really doubt it because Apple does not care about daisy chaining with MST when they have their Thunderbolt ports (which require a Thunderbolt monitor).\nOnly way to get MST working may be using a native Windows installation with Bootcamp on your Macbook.\n\nA: According to Apple's KB - you can get two displays out of one Thunderbolt port if the first display also supports thunderbolt and had a daisy chain second connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25173\nNow - just because Apple doesn't support it, doesn't mean it won't work, but you might not get reliable results or fast results or no artifacts or odd behavior if the displays are connected before the OS fully loads.\nMy understanding is Dell in general and the DisplayPort protocol in specific don't daisy chain, so I'd be sure you can return the second display or both if you need both to work.\n", "Q: Connect 3 External Displays to iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017) Is it possible to connect 3 external displays (for a total of 4, including the built-in 5K display) to an iMac Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017?

For many years I took advantage of the Keynote feature of being able to embed Quartz Composer patches. I have come to accept that this feature no longer exists, and so most of my talks can no longer be given in their current form. However, some still contain slides without animations that I can use, so I would like to be able to open them.\nHowever, when I try, Keynote informs me that the movies are incompatible and will be converted to another format.

I have some end users that delay installing important OS X updates by clicking 'Remind me tomorrow' on the automatic update prompt, sometimes waiting days or weeks to get updates installed.\nTo combat this I'm putting together a script to automatically install software updates in the background using the softwareupdate utility.  In testing, after installing a Security update, I got this message:\n\nYou have installed one or more updates that requires that you restart your computer.  Please restart immediately.\n\nIs an reboot required only to activate the updates, or can it be harmful to the OS or other running processes to install updates in the background and not immediately reboot?\n\nA: Some updates require a restart of the computer, some don't. The reason for a restart can differ - sometimes it's needed to complete the update/installation process, other times it may be simply to ensure that the OS and/or software can utilise the update.\nIn terms of installing updates in the background, this isn't a problem in itself unless its updating a component/software that's currently running, in which case you need to either close the relevant software or effect a restart for the OS to release the component so it can be updated.\nIs what you're trying to do harmful? In most cases not, but in some cases it could be, depending on what the update is doing. \nFor critical updates, the better approach would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*auto install updates outside of particular hours or \n\n*force the update/restart upon users. \n\n\nWith the second option, it's common to have a script that prompts the user that an update is going to be installed and the computer will restart in xx minutes - where xx provides plenty of notice (e.g. 15 mins, 30 mins, etc) and gives them enough time to plan around the restart (such as saving work, grabbing a coffee, etc). \nHowever, what I've done is set this up so the script provides the user an option to 'Restart now' so they have the flexibility to just get it over and done with rather than waiting for xx minutes to pass. The script does not provide a 'postpone' or 'remind me later' option for any critical updates. It is just going to run and the user has been forewarned.\n", "Q: Why does StorageManagement keep quitting whenever I want to look at storage?

This might be helpful at working that out: http://www.buildcomputers.net/cpu-temperature.html\nAs you'd likely know, processors and GPUs have an optimal temperature they run at which is regularly around 50 degrees C. Yours is well over that.\nIt'd be easier to suggest things if we had an idea of the spec and model but these a few general things\nFew things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ventilate - ensure that the air vents are clear - this includes dust and things on your desk - it goes without saying that while a laptop has the word lap in it, it doesn't mean use it on your lap. Lots of laptops I've seen with heat damage are from doing things in bed with the sheets blocking the vents.\n\n*Ensure your fans are operating currently - if they don't sound like they are running at full speed when the CPU is at 80, then your fans or sensors aren't working. To that end, if you are good with physical tools, take the machine apart and clean the fans out with compressed air \n\n\nIf the issue persists take it to an authorised repairer. There could an issue with the thermal paste, and that kind of thing should be fixed by a professional. \nIf this still doesn't resolve the issue it's likely that you have a machine that is under powered to your needs and you are working it too hard.

If its still the case, is there any way I can make the vibration stronger or something?\n\nA: No, you can’t make your iPhone vibrate louder. But since your real issue is that you’re not noticing the vibration while it’s in your pocket, you could try creating a custom vibration that is more noticeable to you.\nCreating a custom vibration\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Tap on Sounds\n\n*Tap on the Ringtone option\n\n*Tap on Vibration\n\n*Tap on Create New Vibration\n\n*Now tap the centre of your screen to record a pattern you think will be more noticeable (I’m thinking two or three long presses will be more obvious when it’s in your pocket, but at least you can try different things until you find one that suits you)\n\n*When finished, tap on Save in the top right-hand corner\n\n*Give your new custom vibration a name\n\n*Make sure it’s now selected as your vibration type for your ringtone\n\n*Exit Settings\n\n\nNote: - All vibrations you create appear in a list of custom vibrations and are available for all events, not just your ringtone (e.g. you can select it for reminders, texts, etc).\n[EDIT - Select or create custom vibrations for individual Contacts]\nAnother option that may interest you is to select or create a custom vibration for people in your contacts. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Contacts\n\n*Select a contact\n\n*Tap on Edit in the top right corner\n\n*Tap on either Ringtone or Text Tone\n\n*Tap on Vibration\n\n*Select one of the standard or custom vibrations\n\n*Go back and tap on Done\n", "Q: How to Wipe Badly Imported Contacts from iCloud My boss has a MacBook Air and an iPhone, and pays for iCloud. We also use Outlook here. We discovered that her contacts weren't being synced properly between her phone and Contacts.app, and attempted to merge them. What we've discovered instead is that we've somehow created inexact duplicates, with the duplicates containing vCard flags marking what kind of data each contact is using:\n\nI don't recall exactly what we did to achieve this - I assume we imported some vCards and hoped that iCloud would sort through the duplicates - but is there any way to erase these contacts without manually stepping through, and has anyone seen this before and can advise how to stop this happening in the future?\n\nA: Run a search for data that would show up in a corrupt vCard, but not a legitimate one. For example: \"type=VOICE\". You may have to do this several times with different strings. I would take the results and export them before selecting all (⌘ A) and deleting them. Make sure you can always undo, if needed.\n\nA: No, the only way you can fix this is by manually deleting the duplicates. iCloud and Contacts aren't very good about this. \n\nA: You can log into  iCloud's site, navigate to the contacts page then you can either individually select contacts or select all and delete in the lower left hand corner cog. This requires you have iCloud syncing enabled for contacts.\n", "Q: Unable to switch keyboard layout I just rebooted and for some reason am unable to switch keyboard layouts.

Except: I live in the Netherlands and we have no toll roads.\nAbsolutely no road I take should be a toll road, but Maps thinks they are. It even helps by saying \"Toll required\".\nIs there a way to reset my Maps data?\nI've had this problem on an iOS 9 iPhone 4S, and I've restored a backup from that device to an iOS 10 iPhone 6s, both show the same toll roads. Every highway or fast lane route is denoted as a toll road.\nPossibly related, while navigating, iOS will commonly add extra names to the proncuation.\nSo for instance \"Karel de Groote laan\" is pronounced \"Karel de-yipiyajeej-laan\". Whenever it mispronounces a street name, it always add \"yipiyajeej\"\nScreenshot of route on iOS:\n\nScreenshot of route on macOS:\n\n\nA: I don't think that's a problem with your iOS as much as it is Apple's map data, unless of course this issue doesn't happen with other iDevices. The best way to correct an issue with Apple's map data however, is to click on the information button in the maps app, then click on \"Report an Issue\" and you can explain the issue there so Apple can fix it in future iOS releases.\n\n", "Q: iPad Kiosk Mode Is there any way that we can set up an iPad to run as a Kiosk for a web application and not be able to access the browser toolbar?

I have successfully received a transferred app as per Apple's documentation on transfers: App transfers\nHowever when uploading a new version of this app I receive this warning that is caused because the app is now under a different team ID:\n\nPotential Loss of Keychain Access. The previous version of software\n  has an application-identifier value of 'A1B2C3D4E5.com.company.app'\n  and the new version of software being submitted has an\n  application-identifier of '5E4D3C2B1A.com.company.app'.

The error message seems to indicate that it has.\nHowever in itunes connect the app's bundle id still shows without the team id as:\ncom.company.app\n\n\nA: Yes the app identifier changes and no the bundle remains in your scenario. Unless you copied the information wrong from the portal, 5E4D3C2B1A.com.company.app is what you’ll ship next iteration. \nWhen you submit and the app goes to sale, only the Team ID part of the app identifier will change and you’ll have the one time loss of keychain data the app stored. \nThis could be minor or major depending on how the app was designed. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2311/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40014135-CH1-A_ONE_TIME_LOSS_IN_KEYCHAIN_DATA_WILL_OCCUR_IF_YOU_SWITCH_YOUR_APP_ID_PREFIX\nIf you have thousands of users or can’t be sure you are safe after talking to the previous Dev or inspecting the code, you might burn one of your paid support incidents with Apple to review the code and be sure you’re safe to go with the change. \n", "Q: How can i disable menu blinking after selecting a menu item in macOS I want to disable the slow menu blinking which occurs after I've selected a menu entry from any menu in macOS. It always takes about half a second or more and is just a waste of time since I know what I am doing.\nSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_blinking for more information.\n\nA: It seems this is just a core MacOS feature built in - if you go into system preferences and General, you can change the color to graphite if you prefer, make it less irritating. Apple made this choice because \"It is a visual clue to help the user understand they have selected this option\", and after this it is executed.\n", "Q: What is Safari's \"local storage\"? I see that Safari stores three things: Cache, Cookies, and \"local storage.\"\nI know what cache and cookies are, but what is \"local storage\"?\nSemantically, cache and cookies are local storage, but presumably this is a third type.\n\nA: Local storage appears to be the holding area for HTML 5 Client Side storage which can be used by modern web apps to store data locally for various purposes.\n", "Q: Touch ID setup fails on new (duplicate) user account I duplicated my account based on this answer. After the procedure, macOS asked me to set up Touch ID. \nI tried multiple times with many different fingers, but I couldn't get it to fully scan the fingerprint. The last \"lines\" would never fill up, and I couldn't get to the part where you're asked to scan the sides of your finger.\nThis process still works fine on the original account. No finger scans correctly on the duplicate account.\nHow can I make Touch ID work correctly on my duplicate account?\n\nA: I imagine (but have not verified) this is because the fingerprints are the same – macOS is identifying that you are the same person. If it allowed registering the same fingerprint twice, it wouldn't know which account to unlock when you touched the sensor.\n", "Q: Trouble Reinstalling macOS Sierra My dad was running macOS & Windows on his Early 2015 MacBook Air, and both crashed. Apple’s service center said the only option was to reinstall macOS.\nUsing the Windows Command Prompt I backed up as much data as I could. Then I tried to reinstall Sierra, but couldn’t boot into the Recovery Partition. Internet Recovery never worked (at best it progressed to 10% then stopped).\nSo I deleted all my partitions and downloaded a Sierra image from someone who put it in Google Drive. I don’t know what I did wrong but it turned my hard drive into an “OS X Base System.”\n\nI tried resetting SMC, PVRAM/NVRAM… Nothing worked.\nNow when I start the Mac normally it tries to resume the macOS installation, but fails because the HDD contains an “OS Installation Media.”\nThen I got my hands on a friend’s Mac that I used to Create a bootable installer for macOS. I now have the USB boot drive, but I cannot boot to it (it shows the Apple logo and then “No Entry”). Trying to boot to the regular HDD also shows “No Entry.”\nI would appreciate any help reinstalling my Mac cleanly.\n\nA: Here's a guide to get you going again.\nNot sure if your question needs to be closed as too broad / too much 20 questions - technical support, but following Apple's erase and install process should fix this at the cost of any data you still have on that drive.\nCan't start Mac in recovery mode - only get folder with question mark instead\n", "Q: Copy pathname from Finder with tilde (~/) instead of absolute home directory Since OS X El Capitan, right-clicking on a file in Finder while pressing \"Option\" shows a menu function Copy \"File.txt\" as Pathname.\nI wonder if I can replace the absolute path of the home directory so that I get the tilde as in\n~/Documents/File.txt\n\ninstead of\n/Users/My-User-Alias/Documents/File.txt\n\n\nA: No.  The ~ substitution is a shell construct.\n", "Q: Duplicating an entire disk I need to replace a fairly new disk with a physically smaller one.  It's not bootable: a Time Machine partition, an HFS+ storage partition, and an ExFat that has a trivial amount of Windows storage on it.\nCan dd duplicate the whole thing, partition map and three partitions?\nOr do I have to partition it first and then do each partition?\nOr should I just use Disk Utility as in How to clone an entire disk with Lion (+Rescue) & Bootcamp Partitions\nActually, given the 4TB size, and the throughput of USB, I guess I need not the easiest method, but the fastest.  That's probably Disk Utility, but it won't do the whole disk.  I have to first match the partitions, then do them individually.\nUPDATE: The reason for copying from a new disk to another of the same capacity is that the old one was too large to squeeze into the bag for travel.  Unfortunately, the new drive failed during the copy!!  I had to start a new set of backups on the smaller one.  Hopefully when I come back in three months, I can recover data and get my money back.  Western Digital, only a month old with a three-year warranty.\n\nA: If you have a more complete answer, by all means, post.\n'dd' is simpler, if you get the details right on the command line.\nDisk Utility however, may be faster even though you have to partition and then restore each partition in turn.  This is because 'dd' is going to copy all the unused blocks.  In my case, with both of them on USB 2.0, if the drive hadn't failed, it would have taken sixty hours.\nAlso, if the two drives don't have exactly the same number of bytes, 'dd' is not good.  If the target is smaller, the O.S. will try to use blocks that don't exist (or it will fail to copy at all).  If the target is bigger, the extra blocks will be inaccessible.\n\nA: \nI need to replace a fairly new disk with a physically smaller one.  a\n  Time Machine partition, an HFS+ storage partition, and an ExFat that\n  has a trivial amount of Windows storage on it.\n  Can dd duplicate the whole thing, partition map and three partitions?\n\nYou may want to consider a utility like Carbon Copy Cloner. This will allow you to adjust the size of the hfs+ and exfat partitions. You will need to make the time machine partition the same size.  Time machine uses hardlinks. I think it is best to use the dd command for the copy. \nYes, the drive must be the same size or bigger than you old drive. If bigger, do the dd copy. run disk utility verify and fix to expand to the larger size.  I would try this on the timemachine partition. Another thought would be to merge the unused space with the last partition.  Be sure to use the /Applications/Utilities/Terminal to check the exact size of the disk. dd is a sector by sector copy.   Use the df command to get exact size information. \nmac $ df\nFilesystem    512-blocks       Used  Available Capacity   iused     ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk1    1951137792 1234788896  715836896    64% 154412610  89479612   63%   /\ndevfs                395        395          0   100%       684         0  100%   /dev\nmap -hosts             0          0          0   100%         0         0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home          0          0          0   100%         0         0  100%   /home\n/dev/disk5    1949177344 1949161960      15384   100% 243645243      1923  100%   /Volumes/3T Mac Mini Backup\n/dev/disk2s2  1952853344   13180368 1939672976     1%   1647544 242459122    1%   /Volumes/--Mojave--\n/dev/disk4s2  1951855464 1912489144   39366320    98% 239061141   4920790   98%   /Volumes/4T Virtual Machines\n/dev/disk4s3  5859978200 4661453928 1198524272    80% 582681739 149815534   80%   /Volumes/4T Backup - Time Machine\n/dev/disk3s4  1951171880 1454044824  497127056    75% 181755601  62140882   75%   /Volumes/3T iMac G3 Backup\n/dev/disk3s5  1956993296 1063139096  893854200    55% 132892385 111731775   54%   /Volumes/3T VM Backup\nmac $ df -h\nFilesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity   iused     ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk1     930Gi  589Gi  341Gi    64% 154412633  89479589   63%   /\ndevfs          198Ki  198Ki    0Bi   100%       684         0  100%   /dev\nmap -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%         0         0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%         0         0  100%   /home\n/dev/disk5     929Gi  929Gi  7.5Mi   100% 243645243      1923  100%   /Volumes/3T Mac Mini Backup\n/dev/disk2s2   931Gi  6.3Gi  925Gi     1%   1647544 242459122    1%   /Volumes/--Mojave--\n/dev/disk4s2   931Gi  912Gi   19Gi    98% 239061141   4920790   98%   /Volumes/4T Virtual Machines\n/dev/disk4s3   2.7Ti  2.2Ti  572Gi    80% 582681739 149815534   80%   /Volumes/4T Backup - Time Machine\n/dev/disk3s4   930Gi  693Gi  237Gi    75% 181755601  62140882   75%   /Volumes/3T iMac G3 Backup\n/dev/disk3s5   933Gi  507Gi  426Gi    55% 132892385 111731775   54%   /Volumes/3T VM Backup\nmac $ \n\nYou could get a smaller drive enclosure and swap in your old drive. \nHere are an example of the dd command:\ndd if=/dev/disk0 bs=4096m | dd of=/dev/disk2 bs=4096m\n\nthe bs needs to be large. doesn't need to match the actual bs. what I do is mount the drive. do a df. unmount the drive. do a df so I can figure out what the drive name is.\nYou may want to consider putting your critical data in the cloud.  dropbox.com\n", "Q: Single user boot : remove read only My OS keeps rebooting since I installed photoshop.\nSave mode didn't help.\nTrying now too boot on single user, I have a UI to unlock my user account (the mac is encrypted) then I have the command line.\nI'm trying to remove everything from Adobe on the launch agent but I can't\nsudo rm -rf com.adobe.AAM.Uploader-1.0.plist returns \"read only file system\" and don't even ask for my password!\nAm I good for a reinstall or anything I can do to remove theses files / or fix my boot issue\nI'm running 10.11 \n\nUpdate: I forget I need to mount the HD first.

How to monitor icloud back up progress? \nI have left my phone plugged in and locked for four or five nights now. The backup has still not completed, but my icloud usage is around 45GB according to https://www.icloud.com/#settings. Does this mean the 45GB of data has successfully been transferred to icloud?

I also have an external USB 2.0 hard drive with enough space on it to hold the contents of the old iMac's drive and I own CarbonCopyCloner.\nMost of the data is one user account and is generally iTunes media (ripped from CDs, so DRM-free on the hard drive of the old iMac) and Logic/GarageBand project data.\nI'm uncertain of my options for transferring the user data from the old iMac to the new iMac.\nCan I use migration assistant and attach the Time Machine drive to the new iMac? Can I boot the old iMac into Target Drive mode and mount it, over the network, to the new iMac and rsync the files on to it? Should I clone the the hard drive to an external USB 2.0 drive with CCC and then import that data onto the new iMac?\nThe data set is sized large enough that I'd like to not have to restart this process several times. What's my most efficient option for transferring everything from one machine to the other in this case?\n\nA: If the old iMac really has gigabit ethernet you can also connect both Macs to a gigabit switch (which is connected to a router of course) and use the migration assistant. Could be even faster than through USB 2.0 with the external HDD.\n\nA: You've enumerated the options quite well there, most of which are described in greater detail by this Apple support document.\nrsync-ing the three home folders across might not preserve all meta-data (which may or may not matter to you), and there are aspects of a user account that exist outside /Users/<username> so rsync alone wouldn't result in working user accounts. Don't be tempted to rsync anything outside /Users!\nPlugging the Time Machine drive into the new machine and using Migration Assistant is likely to be the simplest and fastest option. If you want to take the opportunity to leave some cruft behind, it might not be best suited - I don't recall what level of granularity is offered.\n", "Q: Mac Numbers - how to copy multiline text without quotes When I copy a cell that has multiline content, and paste elsewhere, Numbers puts quotes around it.\nHow do I paste without quotes, I want to paste multiple line, as it is seen in the cell.\n\nA: Try Command+Shift+V to paste without formatting.\n", "Q: iTunes Smart Playlists: Songs not played in the last 6 hours I'm hosting a barbecue on Saturday that is likely to go on well into the night, so I have compiled a playlist of approximately 10 hours of music. I want to make sure that if I need to stop the playback and start it again, I don't want to hear the same tracks already played recently.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to create a Smart Playlist that will only show songs that haven't been played in the last 6 hours. Unfortunately, the \"Last Played not in the last\" shortest option is 1 day. I considered the \"Limit to XX items selected by least recently played\" option, however that will mean the music will be skewed towards music I haven't listened to for the longest, which is not what I want, because that ends up grouping lots of a similar artist together and it won't feel very random. I tried entering a fraction for number of days, but it doesn't allow that.\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how I could get this to work?\n\nA: I do this all the time.\nCreate a smart playlist, Last6Hours.  Limit the size of the playlist to 6 hours; the drop down box for this setting has items, minutes, hours, Mb, etc.  Make sure Live Updating is checked.\nCreate another smart playlist, PlayME.  Add two items: \"Playlist IS 10HourCompilation\" and \"Playlist IS NOT Last6Hours.\"  The setting for PlayME should be \"all\" and not \"any\". Make sure Live Updating is checked.\nPlay the PlayME playlist and you're all set.  \n", "Q: Why does the combination fn+⌘+delete doesn't work? As a new user of MacOS - coming from the Windows world -, I'm trying to quickly learn how the Delete key works here and what are the possible combinations with other keys.\nHowever, while listed in this article (recent, Oct. 2016): https://medium.com/productivity-freak/macos-keyboard-shortcuts-41c8184f65a6 the combination fn + ⌘ + delete doesn't seem to work. I tested in Notes, as well as Google Chrome (I thought at first it was a bug in Chrome).\nI'm using macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73) with an AZERTY keyboard (French layout).\n\nA: I don't know why it gives that shortcut, but try control-k.\nSee https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201236\n\nA: \"delete\" in this article refers to the backspace key (← or ⌫) not the actual delete key (⌦).\nSo the combination your are searching for is ⌘ fn ⌫ or alternatively (if your keyboard has a number pad) ⌘ ⌦.\nNote however that although these are system wide key commands, there are some 3rd-party applications that don't support them.\n\nEDIT: The article also got some combinations wrong. It's ⌥ ⌫ for deleting the last word and ⌥ ⌦ or ⌥ fn ⌫ for deleting the next.\n\nEDIT2:\nIt seems like ⌘ ⌦ and ⌘ fn ⌫ AREN'T system wide key commands (if that is a thing). They don't work in TextEdit or Pages BUT they do work in some other applications such as Apple's Xcode or TextWrangler.\nNonetheless you can achieve the same behaviour by using ⌘ ⇧ → (left arrow key) to select the text to the end of the line and then deleting it. This also works for words with ⌥ instead and for single characters with only ⇧.\n", "Q: How to install an homebrew formula without updating homebrew itself? When I install or reinstall a formula, homebrew automatically update itself before installing the formula.\nWhen working on a slow connection, this is annoying. How can I cancel this automatic update?\n\nA: According to this github issue and to the man page, the environment variable HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE can be set to 1.\nHOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install <formula>\n\nThis will stop the homebrew update for this command. If you want to prevent auto update for your shell session, use:\nexport HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1\n\nto set it permanently, add it to your ~/.bash_profile. Note that changing this permanently is discouraged by the developers.\n\nA: source:\n\nA better alternative may be instead to set HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS to a higher value (the default is to try and update every 60 seconds).\n\nexport HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS=<seconds_you_want>\n\nAdd the command to ~/.bash_profile to keep the settings for different terminal sessions.\n\nA: another possible solution is to send Ctrl-C to the shell while HomeBrew running brew update --auto-update . This will interrupt the updating process.\n\nA: You can also hit Ctrl+C as soon as the\nRunning `brew update --auto-update`...\n\nmessage shows up.

I also added Automator to the Accessibility settings (following this SO answer).\nNow here's the strange part: it works when I have the System Preferences window on focus. If I close it, or switch to any other window, the shortcut doesn't work. I noticed that it's working because there's a menu item in System Preferences window that corresponds to the shortcut, and that is getting triggered when I press the shortcut.\nPlease help. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: As I mentioned in my comment to wch1zpink's answer \"Making sure the Service's settings are correct and the shortcut key sequence is not in use by another is the first step\" and mentioned afterwards by jackjr300 in his comment. Changing the keyboard shortcut to one that is not used by anything else in the system or any application (that is if 'Services receives no input in any application' is set), works for me, whether or not System Preferences is open, when using the code, as is, in the OP and a non-conflicting key sequence.\nThere also is no need to have any applications set in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility for this particular use case, whether running from Automator or when using a non-conflicting keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > (Name You Gave The Service).\nTo resolve your issue, you must use a keyboard shortcut that is not already assigned elsewhere in the system and or any applications.\nYou might have to use a three or four key sequence as there are very few, if any, two key combos that aren't already in use.\n\nOn a side note, return input is not at all needed in the code in this particular use case.\n\nA: Try substituting that entire code in your post with exactly this:\nto clickClassName(theClassName, elementnum)\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to (tabs of window 1 whose URL contains \"youtube\")\n    set youtubeTabs to item 1 of the result\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        execute youtubeTabs javascript \"document.getElementsByClassName('\" & theClassName & \"')[\" & elementnum & \"].click();\"\n    end tell\nend clickClassName    \n\nclickClassName(\"ytp-play-button ytp-button\", 0)\n\n\n", "Q: How to disable SSH passphrase keychain saves in OS X Sierra I like having my SSH passphrase stored for the duration of my MacBook session, so that I don't have to keep entering it every time I SSH into a server, but when I restart my computer I want to have to enter it again (I don't want my passphrase encrypted and stored on disk in the keychain). This wasn't the case until I upgraded from Mountain Lion to Sierra; ever since then, it has been permanently storing my passphrase in my keychain. I can open the keychain preferences and delete my SSH passphrase, but the next time I SSH into a server and it prompts me for my passphrase, it is immediately added to the keychain again.\nHow can I get back to what I had with mountain lion, where my passphrase would be stored for the duration of my MacBook session, but then I would need to reenter it the next time I turn my MacBook on again.\n\nA: There is a new option UseKeychain in Sierra, which defaults to yes and which is a reason for this behavior. If you do not like that, edit the configuration in ~/.ssh/config (or create this file):\nUseKeychain no\nAddKeysToAgent yes\n\nThe second option will tell the SSH agent to store the keys, which has the same result as if you had used ssh-add to enter your passphrase beforehand.\n", "Q: What is the max resolution output by the HDMI port of the MacBook Pro Early 2011 The MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011) has a Thunderbolt port of which I would like to know the maximum resolution. It does not say what it is on the specs site specifically. It merely says \"supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors\", without specifying whether this holds true for all types of connections including HDMI. I have tested a miniDP to HDMI adapter that allegedly supports HDMI up to 4096x2160, but the max resolution i get is 2048x1152. I don't know if this is due to the Thunderbolt port or the adapter.\n\nA: According to EveryMac.com, there were two 13-inch, Early 2011 MacBook Pro models—the 2.3 GHz i5 and the 2.7 GHz i7. It actually doesn't matter which you have. They both have a Intel HD Graphics 3000, which does indeed support an 2560 by 1600 external display. It's your adapter.\n", "Q: Does it make sense to format an external HDD as APFS? I’m currently on macOS Sierra and will upgrade to macOS High Sierra as soon as it comes out, which means my machine will be using APFS.\nI also have an external HDD (not SSD) that has quite a few years on it, already. I use it solely for storage. I have it formatted as exFAT so it’s compatible with both macOS and Windows, out of the box. But recently I’ve noticed that I never connect it to a non-macOS machine.\nSo, would it make sense for me to reformat my external HDD as APFS? Are there any benefits to it over the current exFAT (speed, file integrity)?\n\nA: APFS gives several benefits over exFAT, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Protection against meta-data corruption caused by for example sudden power loss, system crash or if disconnect the external hard drive without unmounting it first. exFAT only detects corruption using checksums, but cannot rollback like APFS.\n\n*Better support for full disk encryption\n\n*Allows snapshotting the file system (i.e. you can create \"frozen\" versions of everything on disk, which will never change - even when you continue to alter the contents of your files)\n\n*Allows cloning a file into two copies that can be independently changed while only requiring the disk space for one file plus the size of the differences compared to the other file\nOn the other hand, exFAT has a range of advantages too:\n\n\n*\n\n*Older file system that is \"tried and tested\" for years on macOS\n\n*Simpler file system with less overhead\n\n*Most probably slightly faster (but this will depend on the final implementation in the release version of High Sierra)\n\n*As you mentioned, the drive can be used without extra drivers on Windows\nOnly you can decide which set of benefits are most important for you.\n\nA: One further reason to reformat is if you may use the drive for Time Machine.\nAs of September 2018 there's no direct official support for exFAT according to this Apple support document\nUnofficially, you can create a sparsebundle as described on MacOSHints\nFirst, connect the unsupported volume (in this case, an exFAT external hard drive.) When it mounts, open the Terminal and type these commands, substituting 'My External HDD Name' for the name of the unsupported volume.\ncd /Volumes\ncd 'My External HDD Name' \n\nNext, type this code, substituting for your needs:\nhdiutil create -size 320g -type SPARSEBUNDLE -fs \"HFS+J\" MacBook-Backup.sparsebundle\nopen MacBook-Backup.sparsebundle \n\nHere, a 320GB sparse bundle named 'MacBook-Backup' is being made and mounted. You can change these values as you see fit. From herein, I'll refer to the sparse bundle name as 'MacBook-Backup'.\nAfter you've run these commands, a new volume named untitled will appear on your Desktop. This will become your Time Machine backup volume. If you want, rename it to something else (I called mine MacBook Pro Backup) and run the command:\ndiskutil list \n\nYou should see a list appear of all connected volumes. Find your new volume's name and read along until you find the disk identifier. In this case, my identifier is disk2s2, but yours may be different.\nFinally, enter the commands below (entering your password if prompted). Replace disk2s2 with your identifier, and 'MacBook Pro Backup' with the name of your new Time Machine volume.\nsudo diskutil enableOwnership /dev/disk2s2\nsudo tmutil setdestination '/Volumes/MacBook Pro Backup' \n\n", "Q: [Sierra]: Mouse scroll Problem:\nWhen using my mouse, a single scroll-click scrolls several pages.\nI have read that this is due to scroll smoothing -\na single scroll actually issues multiple scroll commands:\ntiny teeny 1-line teeny tiny\nthus the appearance of a smooth scroll.\nIf this is the case, then when in single-page view,\neach scroll moves a full-page increment.\nIs there a way to disable this?\nI requested help from Logitech,\nbut they have repeatedly only offered me a new mouse,\nrather than a driver fix.\n.\nI have read several questions regarding mouse scrolling,\nand have not found a consistent answer.\nBackground:\nI purchased a Logitech M705 \"Marathon\" mouse.\nIt worked fine, except that\nits auxiliary buttons are not accessible through the default macOS drivers.\nTo remedy this, I installed the Logitech drivers,\nknown as LCC (Logitech Control Center).\nWhen I installed LCC,\nthe auxiliary buttons worked,\nbut scrolling became terrible.  \nScrolling is choppy in most programs,\nwhich is at least passable if clunky,\nbut there are a special case\nwhere I cannot achieve acceptable usability:\nFull Page View:\nFor several .pdf programs (Skim, Preview, Adobe),\nI use Full Page (also known as Whole Page or Single Page) view.  \nIn this view, the zoom is set such that one full page is shown.\nIf a scroll is commanded, the page does not move up or down,\nsuch that one line of the current page disappears and\none line of an adjacent page appears.\nInstead, a scroll command moves to the next page completely.\nThe whole page is always shown in full.\nThis is not to be confused with Single Page (Continuous) view,\nwhich simply sets the zoom to the level needed to show the whole page,\nbut still allows partial views of two adjacent pages.\n\nA: In system preferences, general, there is a setting where a single click in scroll bar will move forward or backward one page. The other setting moves to region signified by where you click in the scroll bar. This could be several or many pages depending on the size of the document.\n", "Q: Force Quit Keyboard Shortcut Not Working I have a problem where the shortcut command+option+esc does not open the force quit menu. I've tried resetting the NVRAM and the SMC, but this did not fix the issue. \nAlso, sometimes when I reboot the computer the keyboard shortcut does open the force quit menu, but then the touchbar acts strangely: when I tap the buttons on the touch bar, I'm brought to the corresponding section in System Preferences instead (e.g. when I touch to lower brightness, I'm brought instead to the brightness section in system preferences).\nSo either the touch bar doesn't work properly or the force quit keyboard command does not.

Tried resetting with debug mode, turn on and off, delete bluetooth.plist.\nThen I tried to connect the same Magic Mouse to my MacBook Pro running on macOS El Capitan, and voila... I could rename it without a problem.\nSo, it's definitely a bug with the macOS. Not sure since which macOS version the bug existed. But I know for sure that it is okay with macOS El Capitan, and it's not okay with macOS Catalina.\nBut it might also be a bug combined with the hardware\n\nA: none of these will work. I tried pairing with windows or even older versions of macOS it shows with the original name you want to change. this is definitely related to hardware not related to software. by any chance did you buy this device from a friend or are you using a device you originally paired with your old computer ?\n\nA: I solved the issue with mine.

I hope this helps. If I can pin point the root cause of this I will try to work a fix.\nit seems like Yudi Setiawan had success with 10.11\nwhich I also agree Apple seems to have changed something between old versions and newer versions of OS X\nI believe I found the root cause,\niOS and recent versions of Mac OS X restricts direct access to certain characteristics such as \"device name\"\nthis trick based on this should work on android device or a pc running windows natively.\n\nA: Solved it (in macOS Catalina) by performing the rename using a different input-device, \ni.e.: \nTo rename the Trackpad I used a USB-mouse that I connected to my mac.\nMy explanation to this issue\nI suspect that while using the Trackpad to click the [Rename] button, \nthat Trackpad resource is locked and cannot be renamed at that moment.\nClicking the [Rename] button with a different pointing-device\n(in my case: A USB-mouse) did not engage the Trackpad at the moment of rename and allowed the operation to complete.\n", "Q: Seamless Time Machine Wi-Fi backups now that Time Capsule is discontinued? With Time Capsule discontinued, what's the best option for seamless network backups with Time Machine? Something that's out of mind, doesn't need babysitting and that can be trusted to work reliably when needed.\nSome suggestions I've seen:\n\n\n*\n\n*External storage attached to a Mac computer with macOS Server. \n\n*An AFP compatible NAS with the TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes option enabled.\n\n*Time Capsule is still the best solution, and we're stuck with that until it becomes painfully out of date and unmaintained.\n\n\nThe dedicated Mac solution seems clunky: aside from the cost of a dedicated computer, the Mac is yet another thing that needs to be maintained, updated, etc. The AFP NAS solution seems best, but I want to make it can be relied upon (relevant question). Does a NAS work as seamlessly as I'm used to with Time Capsule? (e.g. no need to mount/unmount, etc.)\nWhat are the other options?\nIt would also be nice if this solution supported APFS, given High Sierra's direction.\n\nA: Yes, some NAS work as seamlessly as the Time Capsule. For example Synology DSM has great Time Machine support. There's no need need to manually mount/unmount the network share for each backup.\nYou can read Apple's list of other options here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202784\nIt is essentially either a local drive connected to your Mac (via USB, Thunderbolt, Firewire, SATA, whatever) or a network volume using AFP (NAS, PC/Mac, Time Capsule or AirPort Extreme with external drive connected).\n", "Q: Bluetooth LE Privacy Is there a way to turn off or bypass Bluetooth Privacy on iPhone 5/6/7?

The non-expanded, popover, version of the Character Viewer can be operated from the keyboard alone, via the search box, down arrow, and enter key.\nIf you want enter codes directly from the keyboard, you should be able to type each 5 digit code point using the 8 character utf-16 hex equivalent via the Unicode Hex Input Source, as described in this earlier answer.\n", "Q: iMac 2011 startup issues & x8 beeps I've a iMac 27\" 2011 i7 thats not been used for 2 years, recently plugged back into power and get from what I can make out x8 beeps on pressing power button.

Looking through the Mac App Store I stumbled across a result that really confused me. There I saw the FaceTime App made by Apple. It costs £0.99, with minimum requirements of OS X 10.6.8.\n\n\nI was confused because all new Apple Macs above 10.7 already have FaceTime, so why is it available to be BOUGHT?\nAlso, as I already have the FaceTime app why did the Mac App Store not tick it off and instead show Open? What app will I get if I was to buy what I already have? Is this a listing that Apple has forgotten to take out?\n\nA: As you said, FaceTime for Mac only started shipping built-in with macOS Lion 10.7, whereas the FaceTime app on the Mac App Store runs on macOS Snow Leopard 10.6.8 (which does not have it built-in).\nThe Mac App Store download allows customers unable/unwilling to upgrade past Snow Leopard to FaceTime with Mac users on 10.7 or newer, or those on iOS.\nAs to why Apple does not tick it off for you, it’s simply that this isn’t exactly the same app that ships with 10.7 and above. Case in point, you can’t easily uninstall the FaceTime app that ships built-in, but you could uninstall the one from the App Store, just as easily as you’d uninstall any other app. The version from the App Store also hasn’t been updated in years, as evidenced in your screenshot.\n", "Q: pip disappeared for some reason pip was fine but today when I tried to use it, I got this message:\n-bash: pip: command not found\n\nThat's weird. brew shows that the python package from brew is still installed but now typing python in the terminal will run the one by default on the system instead:\n~: brew install python\nWarning: python 2.7.13_1 is already installed\n\n~: python\nPython 2.7.10 (default, Feb  7 2017, 00:08:15) \n\nTrying to import the packages I had didn't work as well:\n~: python\n>>> import cv2\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: No module named cv2\n>>> import PIL\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: No module named PIL\n\nIf I go into /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/, everything seems fine.

This avoids overriding the system\n  python binary by default when installing Python as a dependency. It\n  also paves the way to eventually have python be Python 3.x.\"\n\n\nA: Having read the discussion about why this Homebrew change took place and some of the linked issues, it seems to me that linking to \"pip\" and \"python\" as you did in your answer might confuse things in the future.  Instead I followed the suggestions in these two GH PRs (and it is confirmed as the correct solution here).\nEdit ~/.bashrc to contain:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH\"\n\nI am using virtualenvwrapper and I also needed to edit ~/.bash_profile to contain a similar line:\nexport VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin/python\n\n\nA: I solved it by manually adding the symlinks back:\ncd /usr/local/bin\nln -s python2 python\nln -s pip2 pip\n\nHowever I still do not know why they disappeared in the first place.\n", "Q: Do Safari private tabs stay open after iPhone shutdown? Does Private Browsing in Safari keep private tabs open when you restart your iPhone 6, or do they get closed automatically?\nIf private tabs remain open, when opening Safari will you see the normal tabs or the private tabs?\n\nA: I just checked this on my iPhone 6 running iOS 10.3.3. I opened a private browsing tab and went to a site then powered my iPhone off. \nWhen it restarted I opened Safari again. My private browsing tab opened up to the exact site I was on when I powered off. \nSo I think you're busted on this one. But you've learned a valuable lesson about private browsing and always having a passcode on your device :-).\n\nA: Safari always reopens in whatever state you left it in. This is true even if you force-quit it through the app switcher or reboot your device.\nSo if you had it open in Private browsing mode, then it will reopen in Private browsing mode, showing you the last Private tab you had open (or the birds-eye view if that’s how you left it).\nUnfortunately, Private tabs do not sync (and therefore are not visible) via iCloud, so you cannot close them remotely either.\nIf this is really important to you, you can still put your iPhone into Lost Mode by logging in to iCloud.com, which will allow you to lock it with a password.\n", "Q: Bootcamp windows 8.1 not booting I recently installed windows 8.1 using bootcamp and it worked well for a few days. For some reason when I turned on my computer it switched to the mac partition. When I turned off the computer and tried to switch to windows, I just got a black screen with no cursor or anything, although it didn't look like the computer was completely shut off. Now, I can easily go on to apple, but whenever I try to use windows I keep getting a black screen with no cursor. I tried searching up what the problem was, but I can't find any solutions.Thanks in advance!\nMacBook Pro with Retina display, OS X El Capitan (10.11.6)\n\nA: That’s most likely not related to Mac OS or Bootcamp, but rather a Windows issue. There’s barely enough information from your side to estimate what’s the problem here, but most likely it’s an issue with the windows bootloader. From a Windows install disk or USB stick, open up a command prompt, and execute the commands bootrec.exe /fixmbr and bootrec.exe /fixboot. These should reinstall the bootloader.\nIn case that doesn’t work, it’s most likely an issue with your Windows installation. Since Windows isn‘t as repairable as Mac or Linux is, it’s likely that reinstalling windows (save all data, format the partition from disk utility in Mac OS and install from the Windows install media again, as you did in the first place) is the best bet to go.\nAnyways, since your question is most likely not related to Apple, you’re good to ask in a Windows QA site like superuser.com how to fix your Windows boot (there’ a lot of answered questions already so just search).\n", "Q: Possible interaction between `brew doctor` and Java I was doing some cleaning earlier with brew doctor and deleted a file from /usr/local/lib with a .dylib extension. Now, whenever I log into a new shell, I get this error:\nError: Could not find or load main class global\nGoogling points toward this being a Java error, but only when trying to run a Java program - never when simply logging into a shell. I've reinstalled Java, but to no avail.\nWhat could be the source of this error?\n\nA: You deleted a file from your /usr/local, which is referenced by programs that are installed with brew. You'll most likely have to go through the reinstallation process to get that .dylib back if you can't find it and replace it on your own.\n", "Q: Beachballing causing Macbook Pro to freeze, with possibly failing SSD I have a Macbook Pro Retina 15\" Late 2013 model (out of Apple Care protection) running Sierra v10.12.6 and it has never frozed up for me until 2 days back, when I was just browsing some pictures via finder when the beachball appeared and it froze. I had to hold the power key to force shutdown it. Upon reboot, the folder with a question mark showed up. \n\nI learnt that it shows up when the mac OS can't find a bootable disk so it doesn't know where to boot from. I tried running into internet recovery mode but when I chose disk utility to scan SSD for errors, there was no drive to select. Makes sense if the SSD has failed all of a sudden and it wasn't being detected at all.\nI tried rebooting again, it booted up just fine. Ran Disk Utility - First aid option, it told me all is OK. So, I thought of taking up a time machine backup in case I had to change SSD, I can just restore backup. Now, after trying a couple of times, in mid of the backup it would get stuck in a position where Time machine backup has stopped as if I cancelled it. The Time machine application continues to run. In finder, all the folders are gone. The computer is not much responsive at the moment. Again, pointing towards the fact that SSD stopped working in between, and hence backup failed + finder is not showing any folders in its sidebar anymore.\nThen yesterday, I tried booting it back, running hardware diagnostics at boot and it reported nothing was wrong with the hardware.\n\nI tried running SMART status tools too, and here is the report - https://gist.github.com/ashfame/0bbf0b7fb06040443a45320a6c112358\nNow the mac's self diagnostics hardware test + SMART status is showing the SSD to be functioning correctly, passing all tests.\nSo may be its a software problem? Since then I have successfully taken up a timemachine backup. It hasn't crashed without not able to detect the SSD since yesterday but the beachball appeared today and it froze. Upon restart, all is working fine again. I tried checking the system.log for the reason of freeze up, but can't find anything significant. I searched for most of the log entries individually on Google.\nHere is the portion of system.log for today, since I wake it up from sleep, till I had to force restart it - https://gist.github.com/ashfame/39fbe27a6ddee0ed6627bf51edf6eea3\nLastly, here is the attached report out of Etrecheck - https://gist.github.com/ashfame/a0466d6937669cedaebbb027663a48f9\nAnd as I am writing this, I just saw this kernel panic in Etrecheck report, which says Root disk errors: \"Could not recover SATA HDD after 5 attempts.

hardware issue. If its hardware, I wouldn't like to go through the trouble of setting and configuring everything up again. Could it be just a hardware connection? A loose wire or something? Should I try reinstalling Mac OS? If so, is it advised to start fresh rather than restoring from a time machine backup? I can live without restoring the time machine backup, can access any files manually that I need. My most important things are already backed up. Just wish for a super solid reliable setup that keeps on running like it has been so far. Thanks for taking the time to read through all of it.\nEdit: SSD benchmark from Ubuntu live USB tells me read speed is awfully slow \nBlackmagic speed test shows it to be alright though \nDriveDx health metrics: \nDisk Drill report: \n\nA: Firstly, backup all yourimportant documents that you don't already have a second copy of (if you can).\nSecondly as IconDaemon suggested, reinstall the OS using internet recovery. Usually I'd suggest just using the local recovery partition but using the external, known good copy of macOS will be beneficial in this case, even though the restore is significantly slower. (Set it up to go over night, it's never very fast, at least not in my area)\nIf the install fails it's likely you have a hardware issue.\nIf the install goes well but the issue persists I'd attempt to wipe your computer complete and then reinstall again. This ensures your user data such as your 3rd party apps aren't causing and issue. Dont do this if you don't have a good backup obviously because you will be losing your data.\nThirdly, and you are starting to run out of options here, I'd try booting to the Internet recovery and installing macOS on a different storage device. This can be a spare hard drive or a large USB stick. This will isolate not only your user data but also the SSD. If this solves the issue you've likely got a faulty SSD. If not it's possible that there is something wrong with you core components or buses - which will likely mean you have a faulty logic board. \nIts most likely that your system is corrupt however is also fairly possible your SSD has failed. The steps above should help you determine the cause of the issue but there is no easy way out of diagnosing the issue, you will have to do restores.\n", "Q: Migration Assistant from Carbon Copy backup? My Mac has died and I'm considering whether to fix and restore to the same hardware or get a new one and import data.\nThe TL;DR: Do you know if Migration Assistant will take a bootable external disk with the data as source? \nThe long story:\nI have a fairly recent Carbon Copy backup of my data (on El Capitan), but if I get a new Mac it'll be running Sierra, so restoring the HD would be a no-no. Also, it would be a good moment to get a \"clean\" OS baseline to work from, as long as I don't have to go back and reinstall everything. \nI know that Migration Assistant can take a disk image file, but I'm not so sure if it'll be able to read a external HD as source?\n\nA: You can select a drive in Migration Assistant.  That is how I transferred my old system to my new one.  I simply mounted the drive of my old system on my new system, and then was able to select it as my migration source.\n", "Q: sshd regular exit code 255 I'm a novice at network things. I enabled remote-login on my home mac (OS 10.12.5) so I could git between home and office. To make it work, I had to tell the wifi to fix my Mac's IP and to redirect Port 22 to it. Works fine. My log file, however, has thousands of messages (one every few seconds) of the form:\ncom.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.openssh.sshd._hex_[_int_]): Service exited with abnormal code: 255\n\nNothing in the log explicitly mentions a refused authentication, and I don't seem to have an auth.log or secure.log file (other posts suggested to look in there). \nAny idea what's going on here?\n\nA: That's the log entry performed when sshd denies a connection. You're probably seeing unauthorised users trying to brute force their way in by trying common usernames and passwords. There used to also be a log entry directly from sshd itself telling you the IP address and username attempted, but Apple has decided to labotomize standard UNIX logging from sshd.\n\nA: If you use ForceCommand in /etc/ssh/sshd_config to override certain ssh commands, then check if that works properly with all users that might log in over ssh.\nIn my case, the script that was called with ForceCommand tried to write to a file that not every ssh user was allowed to write to. As a consequence, the command failed with \"Permission denied\" which caused the script to return a non-zero return-code, and because of this, ssh logged Service exited with abnormal code: 255.\n", "Q: How do I merge the 8 GB of \"free space\" on Macintosh HD under Logical volume group into Macintosh HD?

It says that the new standard will double speeds from 5 Gbps to 10 Gbps. \nIt also says:\n\nif you just bought a brand new computer with USB-C port, \nlike, for example, the 2016 MacBook Pro that I'm using to write this \narticle, you're pretty much screwed.\n\n\nBut according to Apple’s website their USB-C ports \nsupport up to 40 Gbps data transfer speeds. So this is 4 x faster\nthan what the above article is saying about the new USB standard. \nCan someone explain this to me? I am confused.\n\nA: The USB-C ports on your MacBook support USB 3.1 (gen 2) AND Thunderbolt 3.\nUSB 3.1 gives you a transfer speed of 10 Gbit/s and Thunderbolt 3 is capable of up to 40 Gbit/s.\nNote however that just because a device has an USB-C connector that doesn't imply that it supports USB 3.1 gen 2 and thus 10 Gbit/s. It can also be USB 3.1 gen 1, which is basically USB 3.0, which is 5 Gbit/s.\n", "Q: Can't mount exFAT external drive in macOS I have a Western Digital MyBook (25EE) 8TB External Drive.

A quick ps aux | grep fsck revealed that indeed it was hijacking the disk/volume as soon as it was plugged in. sudo pkill -f fsck (or just kill with the PID if you prefer) immediately allowed the volume to be mounted.\nThen to make the hard drive writable, you have to run the Disk Utility \"S.O.S.\", unmount then mount it again.\n\nA: Just wanted to record my experience for those who follow after...\nI have a 4TB WD My Passport, ExFAT, being used on MacOS 10.14.6\nIt suddenly and unexpectedly did not Mount after a reboot. It was shown in the Disk Utilities app but would not Mount (nothing would happen) and First Aid would not work on it (kept returning an error).\nI unplugged it and tried it on a Windows PC and it worked fine, gave a warning about something being wrong but allowed access and it worked fine.\nI then did a quick search for ways to force Mount HDDs and foun d another SE page with some useful Terminal commands.\ndiskutil list\n\nreturned this\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:       Microsoft Basic Data Storage_001             4.0 TB     disk2s2\n\nI tried the process mentioned on the other SE page, things like;\nmount -t dev/disk2\nmount force -t dev/disk2\n\nSadly, that process did not help. Further searches revealed, as expected, it might be an ExFAT on MacOS issue which lead me to this page and the reply from Broski.\nI ran the command he recommended and lo! I got a pop-up warning on the desktop about the HDD having mounting issues and then looked in the Disk Utilities app to find it had now mounted A-OK.\nSo, thanks Broski (I tried upping your comment but am too new to have permission).\nAnyone coming late to the party, try the fsck pkill option.\nsudo pkill -f fsck\n\nNow to backup and reformat that HDD.\nCheers!\n\nA: The recent Western Digital \"easy store\" and \"My Book\" hard drives have a Mac Sierra 10.12.6 issue: They are invisible to the Desktop.\nWD Utilities says my two drives check out ok; Mac Utilities recognizes both hard drives. \nGoing to the Mac Genius Bar on Monday. BestBuy sold me the original WD easystore 8T and WD sent me a My Book 8T. BestBuy said the WD easystore was dying; a computer technician said no way. Both WD HD's were reformatted ExFat. MacBook Pro Finder cannot see either hard drive.\n\nA: I had a similar mounting issue and got the \"com.apple.DiskManagement.disenter error\". The following command solved the issue:\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/External/ && sudo mount -t exfat /dev/disk2s2 /Volumes/External/\n\nA: On macOS Big Sur, I did some additional steps after following Broski's Answer.\nMy exFAT Drive was still readonly and MacOS warned me to backup and reformat again. Disk Utility's First Aid didn't work for me. Unmount Mount testing also didn't work.\nI found this link to fix corrupted exFAT disk.\nhttps://gist.github.com/scottopell/595717f0f77ef670f75498bd01f8cab1\nIt's very helpful, and I don't need to recover, backup and format my drive. Now, My Files are available to copy and rewrite back.\n\nA: Formatting large volumes exFAT on Windows tends to default to an allocation unit size (read block size) of larger than 1024.\nmacOS has trouble finding the boot region on disks like that.\nBackup your external drive, reformat it under Windows with a block size of 1024, then copy everything back.\n\nA: exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table) file system is the successor to the great old FAT32 file system. It has many pros and cons. One of the pros, for instance, is file size limit's now up to 16 Exabytes. But... \nIt's not used and was not designed for formatting hard drives. It is only recommended for flash memory storage. That's the only reason it is currently not considered as huge competitor to NTFS on hard drives. Also exFAT contributes to the emergence of permission problems and corrupted files. Suppose your situation is related to this issue.\nI would try to reformat it although you've got 8TB to transfer.\n\nA: This happens with me as well, I'm using a 1TB USB ext drive in exFAT format when suddenly it doesn't mount in my MacBook Pro (M1 - Monterey) but can be accessed from Windows (with Parallel Desktop 18 - Windows 11 ARM).\nI've tried all the above steps, but none of them are working. So in my desperation, I plug the USB into a Windows 10 laptop, and I notice a flag in the Disk Management (from this PC, right click, click manage, then click Disk Management) \"drive encrypted\".\nSo I go back to my MacBook, plug the USB drive, open Parallel Desktop, open Control Center, select the Windows 11 ARM, go to Setting, add a hard drive, select physical drive, select the USB drive, and boot up Windows 11.\nFrom Windows 11 screen, then I search \"device encryption setting\" in Windows Start, then turn off the device encryption, it took a whole night to complete the decryption process, then the next morning, exFAT can be mounted back to macOS Monterey. Alhamdulillah!!!\n\nA: I faced this issue in the latest macOs Big Sur 11.2.1. The disk won't mount or soft eject. I ran Frist Aid option in Disk Utility which took a few minutes since it was scanning the Trancend external drive. After the scan, I had to unmount and mount it back again inorder for the disk to be writable.\n\nA: I had the same problem on Mac OS Big Sur. Western Digital My Passport for Mac 5TB formatted exFAT. After 6 hours I came back and it had magically mounted. Eject, reconnect, mount OK in seconds.\n\nA: The issue seems to be multifold. A thumb drive formated with exfat is being seen as FAT and not exfat by the Mac. Running first aid on the failed partition in Disk Utility fails with fsck_msdos being run...\nRunning fsck_exfat on the partition /dev/disk2s1 returns fine. Running it on the disk /dev/disk2 fails looking for the boot regions/signatures.\nOkay so the issue here is that the Mac is seeing the wrong type of filesystem. We can override.\nAs others have shown, creating a folder and manually mounting the partition works. This is a workaround to access the files but does not fix the disk.\n\nA: When connecting the external hard disk, just go to Activity Monitor in MacBook Applications there you can find \"fsck_exfat\". Double-click on it and click on Quit or Force Quit, then your hard disk will appear on desktop\nYou can even access this disk on Disk Utility for mount/unmount and whatever options are required.\n", "Q: Can I update Mac OS 10.11 to 10.11.6 using a dmg of the update? My internet connection is lame  and the last time I tried to update with the download through App store, it downloaded and restarted but said that the verification of the update package was unsuccessful . I don't want to do that again . \nSo, I have manually downloaded the update package (1.55 GB) from http://supportdownload.apple.com. Now how do I update Mac OS , and also I don't want the verification failed kind of error. I also do know that this happens at some cases when OSx needs to be installed through the recovery section and you sure can fix it changing the systems date, but how do I do it in this case?\n\nA: You can get the dmg file from here: https://support.apple.com/downloads/macos\nWhile downloading the dmg please check the system requirement.

That seems strange to me. Why is that app not on the App Store?\n\nA: Unlike the iOS App Store, the Mac App Store isn't the single repository for all apps you can install on the platform (excluding jailbreak). Developers are in no way obligated to make their apps available via the Mac App Store; in fact most choose not to.\nAs to why, that discussion is probably off-topic on this site. However there are many technical restrictions placed upon App Store apps that are generally incompatible with the way an antivirus-type application (eg. Malwarebytes) needs to operate.\nThis is why Apple Support would routinely point you to an app that is not available on the Mac App Store.\n\nA: The Apple Support people were simply providing good customer service.\nIf you go to a retail store asking for help with a problem, would you rather that they (a) state the problem cannot be solved (because they do not carry such products in their store), or (b) give you directions to another store that carries the product you need?\n", "Q: Saving .mp4 file to iCloud drive, saying need more space but drive saying 147GB available!

When I try to drag to trashcan, it says it's a system app that is required by os. \nHow do I bypass this check and remove the app?\n\nA: There are instructions for removing font book on this page\nhttp://www.jklstudios.com/misc/osxfonts.html#fontfolderlocations\nIf you just want it hidden, there's always a chflags command to hide it. You need to bypass SIP restrictions on that folder before you can delete or change the flags to hide it, so it's not going to be quicker than removing it - just easier to undo if you find you or another program needs it at a later date.\nls -laO / && ls -laO /Applications | grep Font\n\nThe first listing shows the variety of flags (hidden, sunlink, restricted, uchg) and the second shows Font Book is restricted from change even by root.\nhttps://derflounder.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/system-integrity-protection-adding-another-layer-to-apples-security-model/\n\nA: Just like the warning says, Font Book is a system app. That means it's part of the operating system. You can't delete it because it handles important functions that make your computer work. It handles all the fonts on your computer, including the one you're using to read this website. Apple has some info on Font Book in their Mac Basics documentation.\nEDIT for the truly determined: \nI see what you're saying. However, if you take a look at threads of folks removing Font Book, you'll see all on the older side. Starting with El Capitan, Apple introduced System Integrity Protection. You can disable SIP, but it can be pretty dangerous. However, Apple did make that a tiny bit easier in Sierra by no longer requiring a boot into your Recovery partition to make the change. (That should give you an indication of how strongly this is discouraged!) \nHere's a quick article describing the Terminal commands to turn off SIP in Sierra without booting into Recovery. With SIP off, you should be able to delete whatever you want, so you'll probably want to turn it back on as soon as you're done dumping Font Book.\n", "Q: How to export to $PATH permanently because .bashrc file doesn't exist in $HOME directory I am trying to figure out macOS and want to install Composer which was not a problem....but I need the Laravel and Symfony installer and in the documentation it says that I need to export the variable in .bashrc file.\nNormally that file is in /home/username/ directory on Linux\nBut where is the .bashrc file on the Mac? How to export to the PATH? \n\nA: It should be stored in /Users/username/. To append something to your .bashrc file use \necho foo >> ~/.bashrc\n\nMake sure to use >> and not >, as the latter will overwrite the file. \nAs @fd0 said, you probably want this in your .bash_profile to make sure it loads. I would append to your .bash_profile like this:\necho \"export PATH=\"$HOME/path/added:$PATH\"\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n", "Q: What data counts as \"photos\" or \"movies\" When looking up how much data is left on my tiny MacBooks SSD (under \"about this mac\"/\"storage\" 1.74 GB are marked as photos, and 429.9 MB as movies, which is odd, considering that I intentionally have deleted the photo library and the iMovie library.\nThis leaves me with two possible conclusions: either there are some \"secret\" photo and movie libraries containing above 2 GB of data, or this photo/movie data includes all image and movie files (ie. PNG, JPEG, MPEG, MOV, and similar) which are in use other places on my computer.\nMy question is, therefore, does this photo and movie data only include files saved in specific folders/libraries at specific locations associated with build in movie/imaging programs such as iMovie, photobooth or similar, or does it include a vast number of files with different purposes at different locations around the filesystem?\n\nA: Spotlight is the system that classifies files, so if you use the command line tool in terminal.app to list the spotlight information of a file you can see how the classification is performed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*Type mdls and then drag any file from your desktop (or anywhere in finder) to the window and drop the icon.\n\n*Press return\n\n\nThe fields to focus on are kMDItemContentType and kMDItemContentTypeTree and a bit further down the list is kMDItemKind ;\nkMDItemContentType             = \"public.png\"\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\n    \"public.png\",\n    \"public.item\",\n    \"public.png\",\nkMDItemKind                    = \"Portable Network Graphics image\"\n\nIn my example I used a screen shot png file - which is one of many image formats that will then be counted against the total. Under kind information, you can also see the logical (size of the bits) and physical size (how much space the file takes up on the drive with overhead for block sizes and accounting) which would get summed up for each \"category\"\nSo - to find out what might be categorized as an image - type this command out (or paste it if you trust me/it/whomever edits this last):\nmdfind \"kMDItemKind = '*image*'\" | head -3\n\nThe pipe symbol | takes all the lines of text that mdfind produces and shows you the first three lines of text. Instead of piping to head -3 you could also pipe to more to page through the list one screen at a time. Press spacebar to move, q to quit and h for help in more.\nTo count all the files with the string image in the kMDItemKind field:\nmdfind \"kMDItemKind = '*image*'\" | wc -l\n\nFor context, my two smaller Mac have between 85k image files and 110k image files. Note, on newer OS - some of the images will be marked \"purgeable\" so you might over count at the command line but you should have a better feeling of what images exist and if you need to uninstall apps or they are just part of the operating system to have images to show you for the controls in Safari, the default desktop backgrounds, etc...\n", "Q: How did my Apple Watch answer a phone call after my iPhone's battery died? I have an original 1st generation Apple Watch Sport paired to an iPhone 6.\nWhile at home, I had a scenario where my iPhone's battery died while I was typing out a text message. Without thinking, I held down the Digital Crown to send my message using Siri.\nTo my surprise, a few moments later I felt my Apple Watch ringing with a phone call from my friend.\nSomehow, I was able to send texts and answer phone calls on my Apple Watch, despite my paired iPhone having a dead battery.\nHow is this possible?\n\nA: This is WiFi calling and iMessage in action.\niMessage is a messaging service that is brokered through Apple's iCloud servers and delivers point to point messages to multiple devices instead of needing SMS to deliver a message to a mobile phone. This allows messages on macOS, iPad, iPod touch and Apple Watch to send and receive messages \"from\" and \"to\" mobile numbers.\nWiFi calling is even better - it links the carrier directly to your Apple devices that are not your iPhone. It is basically a VOIP bridge from the iCloud authenticated devices to a gateway server that bridges the call to the telephone network.\n\nMake and receive Wi-Fi calls from another device\nIf your carrier supports Wi-Fi Calling on iCloud-connected devices,\n  you can also make and receive Wi-Fi calls on other devices.

You might want to reformat from a previous backup.\n", "Q: Documents or Desktop not Staying in Favorites in Finder Mac Whenever I add the documents or desktop folder to favorites on macOS Sierra, it stays there for some time but then disappears. Is it a problem with iCloud Drive?\nUpdate: It still occurs in macOS High Sierra. I tried booting into safe mode, resetting PRAM and SMC, resetting finder preferences, but it still doesn't fix the problem.\nYou can see it here:\nhttps://youtu.be/TJubgY3tUKM\n\nA: Im not sure what is causing this, but you could try force quitting Finder. Go to the Apple icon in the top left corner and select the Force Quit option. A menu will pop up and you can click on Finder to restart it. Also, if you open the Finder preferences you should be able to select which folders appear in the side bar.\n\nA: Here's a link I found, I was experiencing the same issue. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4283571\n", "Q: Mount PC's HDD on Mac, with a USB from Mac to PC I was wondering is it possible to connect, a MacBook and a PC by a USB cable and then mount the PC's HDD/SSD on the MacBook?\nFurther more if this is possible, would there be any restrictions on the MacBook's side?, I know about lacking support for NTFS, but how about using programs such as Scalpel, and the Sleuthkit collection to restore deleted data, and such?\n\nA: You can transfer files over WiFi or BlueTooth. For fast speeds you can plug both computers into a router via Ethernet cables and communicate over the network that way. These are the non-invasive approaches that don't require special cables or enclosures for the HDD you are copying from. You can also try a file sharing server like Samba that you run on one machine and use the other to transfer from. You won't need special drivers for NTFS if using one of these networked approaches. \n\nA: In short, no.\nUSB needs a 'master' at one end & a 'slave' at the other. You cannot connect two computers that way - each expects to be 'master'.\nYou'd be far better off putting the drive in a USB enclosure then connecting that to the Mac.\nNTFS write can be either enabled natively or using 3rd party software - How do I write to NTFS drives in OS X? \n", "Q: Sound from the speakers of my MBPro with Touch Bar degrading I have a 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch bar.\nWhen I play loud music or watch a movie in which there's a noisy action scene for instance, the speakers' sound quality suddenly degrades. Sound continues to be played but as if there was no treble at all. The only \"fix\" I've found is to plug headphones, wait till the system output gets changed to the headphones, and plug them out again. This seems to reinit the built-in speakers to good, full-spectrum quality, but not for long — sound quickly degrades again under the same conditions.\nIs there anything I can do about this?\n\nA: UPDATE: almost 3 months later, multiple updates down the road and upgrade to high sierra, I am sad to report that the issue still persist. I will probably have to return to the apple store to RMA my macbook...\n\nI'm sorry I would comment on your post instead posting an answer but new account requires me to have enough rep....\nI have the exact same  issue with my macbook pro 2017 15\" with touchbar. \nI found that it happens only after going over around 85% volume. No matter which software provokes it.\nPlugging and unplugging headphones work for me too. Also killing coreaudiod solves the issue but requires apps that were using the sound drivers to be restarted.\nThis is a real pain to manage.\nI hope this is a software issue as it seems to have started right after Sierra was updated on July 27 2017.\n\nA: This is happening to me as well, under the same circumstances. Rebooting my computer allows me to listen to loud audio again, but only for about 10-15 minutes before the sound degrades again.\n", "Q: Using older operating systems I am wondering, other than personal preference which is obviously subjective, what utility does one derive from running outdated operating systems? I notice a lot of folks posting here with questions and they indicate, for example, they are running Yosemite. What are the implications of this for, say, security in general and support from Apple? What productivity, ease of use, flexibility, and/or any other benefit does one accrue for one's self by running an older OS? Thanks. \n\nA: One of the most common causes for running outdated operating systems is hardware support:\nHardware compatibility issues usually comes in two forms. Either the newer operating system in itself is not compatible with an older Mac, or alternatively connected peripheral units are not compatible with the newer operating system (i.e. lack of updated drivers).\nIn such cases you might want to continue running the older operating system in order for the Mac to work at all, or in order to keep using old peripheral devices.\nAnother common cause for running outdated operating system is software support.\nSome applications are not timely offered in newer versions that support newer operating systems - or they might not be updated at all. In that case the application could be more important than the operating system for user - thus keeping the user on an outdated system. \nSimilarly some vendors charge fees for updates to applications that are needed in order to support newer operating systems. The user might not want or is not able to pay for those extra upgrades, and is thus forced to run an older operating system.\nOther causes include:\n\n\n*\n\n*The user simply liking the old software better than the new\n\n*The user has special training for the old software, but is not familiar with the new\n\n*The user not taking the effort to upgrade. \n\n*The user not understanding the benefits of upgrading. \n\n*The user is \"afraid\" to upgrade because he fears wrecking the system.\n\n*The user seldomly using the computer thus running into a problem that he needs support for before actually realizing that the computer is not updated\n\n*The user has a specific interest in older operating systems (i.e. \"museum\" type usage)\n\n\nThe implications for security are often that you're on an operating system that is no longer vendor patched - thus leaving you open to hackers and/or malware.\n", "Q: When I download a text file, .txt gets added to filename. How do I prevent this? When I download a text file with extension .mac (or any extension but .txt) the file downloads but the extension .txt is added to file name. How do I prevent this from happening?\n\nA: You can only in general prevent this if you control the server. \nI assume you're talking about downloading using a browser - in which case the web server controls the file type and naming using the Content-Type MIME indication as well as the Content-Disposition header for specifying the file name.\n", "Q: How can I change a Numbers graph x axis to go from the lowest value to the highest value? I'm graphing columns A and B, where A is the x axis. I have entries entered in A like so: 1, 3, 2, 4, 5... and so on.\nWhen I select A and B and make a graph, it seems like the x axis does not automatically arrange itself from the lowest to the greatest value, meaning the graph looks quite strange. \nIs there a way to make the x axis graph the data as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... instead of as 1, 3, 2, 4, 5...?\nSorry if I am unclear. I will make amendments at the earliest opportunity if clarification is required.\n\nA: Sort your data ascending based on the values in column A - the x-axis.\n", "Q: Apple TV: Account verification nuisance My Apple TV keeps nagging me to enter my password for account verification.\nWhen I give it the correct password, it appears to accept it, but will continue to ask for verification.\nVerification isn't even actually required, because it gives the option to decline, so it's pointless.\nIt's easy enough to deal with but it's constantly harrassing me with frequent verification request popups during movies, etc.\nDoes anyone else have the same problem, or is it an isolated case?\nDoes anyone have a solution, short of contacting Apple? Thanks.\n\nA: Depending on what specific verification item is problematic, you might need to reset the Apple TV and make sure your Apple ID and date/time setting work before loading any third party apps or logging into other accounts. \nThere is a chance you could use Xcode to look over the AppleTV logs and determine what app is triggering the requests, but it might be faster to wipe and verify it’s not software corruption or storage issue. \n", "Q: iOS WriteRoom editor feature replacement? One of my favorite features about WriteRoom is that as soon as I open it, I see a listing of a Dropbox directory I have previously configured. No extra steps. This lets me very quickly get to my notes and records without navigating around, since I always want to go to the same directory.\nSince WriteRoom will soon become incompatible with iOS 11 since it is a 32-bit app and is not being actively developed, does anyone know which of the many text editors available has this feature?\nPer @patrix suggestion, here are prioritized features for a Dropbox text editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open directly to a particular Dropbox folder at launch, after a one-time configuration step. No additional navigation. Speed is #1!\n\n*Sync that Dropbox folder's contents to the device, so that it can be accessed offline, and the changes reconciled after coming back online\n\n*Text search through the entire folders files, and also within the file once it is open.\n\n*Sort the folder list by name or date, descending.\n\n\nA: My suggestion is Ulysses. A pleasant, focused writing experience combined with effective document management, fast syncing and flexible export make Ulysses the first choice for writers of all kinds.\nHere is some info about synchronisation with Dropbox. A quote from that post really describes the function you are searching for.\n\nOnce your Dropbox account is linked, you can navigate through its hierarchy and choose folders to add to Ulysses’ library.\n\nI do not have financial ties with Ulysses!\n\nA: WriteRoom for iOS is back developed and named Writemator. Wrtemator support ios 11- ios 9. Based on the WriteRoom app for iOS.

Every once in a while, I connect the external hard disk and sync the files per hand. As the files I am syncing are always the same, it came to my mind that I could automate the whole process as a shell script.\nHowever, I could not find a helpful command that compares A to B (which will then ask me to sync if sync is necessary). I have found rsync but the documentations did not explain how to synchronise a single directory.\nI also haven't figured out how to change directory to an external HDD connected via USB.\n\nA: This is easy to accomplish using rsync. \nThe easiest route is to open terminal and type rsync -r and that drag the source folder to the window, followed by the destination folder. -r stands for recursive, so it will look inside the folder and its subfolders. I just synced a folder on my desktop and a mounted USB drive with this command: \nrsync -r /Users/My-User/Desktop/Test_folder /Volumes/My-USB-Drive/Test_on_USB\n\nIt actually creates the Test_folder inside the Test_on_USB folder. \nI'm not an expert on all the options, but you can find them here: http://everythinglinux.org/rsync/ \nLet me know if that accomplishes what you're after. \n", "Q: Apple Mail on Yosemite not syncing with Exchange Strange issue that neither my email provider not Apple could help with! so I come to you and hope you can solve the problem they could not!\nI added the Exchange account in question a week or so ago.

I did with resluts I cannot explain.\nApple Mail now refuses to recognise the inbox. It brings in messages from 2015 and nothing newer. This is clearly bizarre. I have removed the account and re-added and no matter what - I seem to get the same result. \nAs a workaorund I added the account as an IMAP but I'd really like to get my exchange account working properly. Does anyone have any suggestions?\nMy only theory is that there is some file - some cached set of settings that is ruining my efforts to add a new account.\nAnyone have any ideas? I'd be most grateful!\n\nA: There looks to be changes made on exchange accounts that seem to affect mac osx 10. Yosemite.  Those who has this have a older version of apple mail client installed and the solution is to upgrade your mac to the highest version of mac os your device will take and the version of apple mail installed will work again with exchange accounts\n", "Q: Is there an extension for macOS Photos for perspective correction? I was wondering whether anyone knows of, or can recommend, an extension for Photos on macOS that allows correcting perspective?\n\nA: The app “Perspective Photos Extension” would seem to be the answer to my question. But neither its screenshots nor its reviews convinced me it would be worth the purchase. I haven’t come across any similar app that provides a Photos extension. Instead, I decided to try “DxO Perspective” in combination with “External Editors For Photos”.\n\nA: This is an old question, but still without a satisfactory solution within the Mac Photos app.\nOne workaround is using the Acorn editor, an excellent, lower-cost Mac photo editor (compared to Photoshop) with most of the functionality I needed.\nTo fix warped photos in Acorn, first zoom out, so your image has plenty of room around the edges.  You'll need that room to drag your skew lines outside the photo's boundaries.  Then go to Layer > Rotate and Transform > Perspective Transform.  (Source: Transforming Layers | Acorn 7)  Adjust the image as needed.\nI've attached an example of correcting a slightly skewed photo of a piece of paper.  This particular photo is not severely crooked, but you can at least get an idea of the technique.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I find Readdle's Scanner Pro (for iOS) does a great job of auto-detecting document edges and applying perspective correction of pages with its (automatic) Distortion Correction feature.  It can interoperate with existing images stored in the Photos app from the Mac.\n", "Q: Why won't my iPad apps sync when connected to my computer? I have always updated my application on iTunes and then let them sync to the iPad.\nSince I installed iOS 10.3.3, the apps no longer sync. I have rebooted the device. I have attempted to sync many times.\nThe App Store on the iPad shows pending updates, but they never install.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: The obvious thing to try first is to reset your privacy and location preferences. You will then be asked to trust the iTunes/computer drivers (and asked to set privacy settings elsewhere as they come up). \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202778\nAt that point, the issue is almost certainly on the computer end with iTunes or iTunes settings or the os/usb hardware and drivers.

For example after I've just added pictures to my Photos.app library and then restarted Photos.app (for whatever reason). The problem seems to be, that spotlight starts doing indexing in the photos library directory and messes up with Photos.app... If you wait for a couple of minutes the problem should go away by itself. In my case restarting Photos.app does not help, restarting my Mac does not help, ejecting and then remounting the external hard drive again does not help either. The only thing that works is waiting.\nIf your external drive is slow, or if you've added lots and lots of photos it might take longer.\n", "Q: Possible to create a Bash alias that enters a certain string into Terminal? Is it possible to create a Bash alias that upon running, enters a string of my prior choosing, into Terminal?\nLet's pretend this is in my ~/.bash_profile:\nalias start_youtube=\"cd ~/Video/Youtube; **[PASTE: youtube-dl URL]**\"\n\nImagine that: the alias would change directory to Video/Youtube and then [PASTE] the string: youtube-dl URL. It could either do Return ⏎ or preferably just leave the string youtube-dl URL in the Terminal prompt so that I could swap the placeholder URL for a real URL.\nIf I try actually running the alias below;\nalias start_youtube=\"cd ~/Video/Youtube; youtube-dl URL\"\n\nit will run the command as entered by which youtube-dl will return an error like \"Could not parse URL\" – which could've been fine. But pressing the ↑ key will not show the last input of the alias (youtube-dl URL) but rather shows the invoking of the alias (start_youtube) [which I'm sure is usually preferable].\nSo the requested solution is to paste a placeholder string into the Command Prompt, or somehow access the history of the alias command via the Shell.\n\nA: Here's how I would approach it. Use this related question to write the function that would reside in your bashrc or bash_profile. Then add a line in the function that would delete the most recent line in your bash history using this\n\nA: You could use osascript for this and tell the System Events to type keys for you. Generally, I strongly advise against the whole approach of blindly sending keystrokes to the shell, you can wreak havoc on your system with this!\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\" to activate' -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"# cd /tmp; your text\" '\n\nFor safety reasons I send the comment character # as the first character, but this line gives the result you wanted. The cursor waits after the your text and you may continue typing. \n", "Q: Mac OS Sierra System Settings won't stay set I just got a new 15\" MBP with Mac OS Sierra. I've changed the System Preferences to allow me to drag and drop things with the touchpad (under accessibility) and to prevent tap clicking.\nBut after I leave the system preferences pane, and return to check it out, the preferences have changed. Is this a known issue with Mac OS Sierra? Or did the method of confirming changes, change? I'm at a loss for this one.\n\nA: It’s possible your Accessibility preference file is corrupted.\nOpen Finder, then press ⇧ shift ⌘ cmd G. In the popup textbox, type in ~/Library/Preferences.\nLocate com.apple.universalaccess.plist and delete it.

Problem\nI imported a large OPML file to a Feedly (a RSS/source aggregator web service), and the import got messed up. I now need to delete the entries on their website using Google Chrome, but there is no way to bulk delete.\nInstead of manually clicking almost a thousand times, I'd like to quickly automate a Left-Mouse Click and loop it for as many times.\nThe reason I'm stating my specific use-case is because I am unlikely to ever use this particular automation again. I need a quick and dirty solution.\n\nQuestion\nWhat is indeed the fastest and easiest way to record and repeatedly perform a mouse-automation tasks, in macOS Sierra?\n\nSolutions\nI took a stab at macOS Automator's Watch Me Do but really didn't get it to work with Chrome as it seems to interpret Left-Mouse clicks as \"Drag the scroll thumb in the scroll area\" (??)1.\nI also investigated some third-party options like Keyboard Maestro and Murgaa (not endorsing any of these, nor have I tried them), as well as some scripting alternatives like CliClick but I must admit that learning how to script with these utilities feels a bit cumbersome right now.\nI'm preferably looking for a reliable, and free, Mouse/Click Automator circa 2017 with a GUI. Is there something like that which is recommendable? Or should I tinker more with Automator or something else?\n\n1I've added Automator to the macOS Accessibility settings.\n\nA: I know you already rejected CliClick, but what if the script was provided for you? It’s actually quite simple. In Script Editor enter the following:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    activate\n    repeat 500 times\n        do shell script \"/Users/<you>/Desktop/cliclick c:\" & \"1694,18\"\n        delay 1.5\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nReplace 1694,18 with the actual coordinates of the button you want to click. Those can be obtained by pressing ⇧ shift ⌘ cmd 4 and hovering your cursor over the button.\nAlso replace <you> with your account name, and adjust the delay as appropriate, to account for any animation or form postback.\nObviously this is all assuming the click occurs in the same spot each time. Your question doesn’t specify, although I get the sense that that is the case. Otherwise it would be very hard to script as a repeating click.\n\nA: Selenium isn't intended for this purpose, but likely could be scripted to solve your problem.\nhttp://www.seleniumhq.org/\n\nA: on MacOS this worked for me:\nFirst install cliclick:\nbrew install cliclick\n\nThen run this script:\nfor i in {1..20}; do cliclick c:1410,290; sleep 1s; done\n\nThis will trigger a mouse click each second at coordinates 1410, 290.\nThe script will repeat 20 times.\n", "Q: How can I determine the battery level of my magic mouse from the command line?

There is a small program, called Unshaky written on Swift. It fixed this issue for me.  It lets you configure a timeout for each key to suppress duplicate keypresses. For instance, if the 'e' key is giving you trouble, you can configure the timeout for a longer duration and adjust for the best results. There is also a statistics panel that shows how many times a key was suppressed by the software, as well as a detailed breakdown for each key.\n\nA: A seemingly workable way is to Enable Slow keys under the Accessibility setting of Keyboard. For me, a slight adjusting above Short can mostly resolve the problem.\n\nA: I have the same problem. I gradually started noticing double key presses for few keys showing up in the text I typed. The offending keys are: i, t and e.\nHow to reproduce\n\n\n*\n\n*I went to Keyboard > Key Repeat > Off.\n\n*When I press down the i and then slide my finger from the left edge to the right edge of the key, it triggers more keypresses. \n\n*If I key my finger still and press down with more pressure, it sometimes triggers more keypresses.\n\n\nPressure seems to be important. If I rub lightly it doesn't happen as much.\nI wonder what is causing it. I hope its dust. I will clean my keyboard tonight. But seeing as they all occur in the same row, maybe its something to do with the circuitry - I have to research more about how the keyboard works.\n\nSprayed my laptop keyboard with a lot of pressurized air. Did not help at all. the T and I keys are still consistently causing issues.\n\nA: The current range of MacBook Pros seem to be suffering from this problem with the keyboard. To the point where they have released this technical note about how to attempt a fix.\nBut a recent article has brought this to the forefront of the tech-news, and as a result Apple may be forced to take more action on this obvious design flaw. It has reached the point where there is even a song now.\nI also had a problem with the L key on a new laptop at work. Spare a thought for those of us who live in a country that has no Apple stores. From here in Thailand, any repair that requires a return means a three-week (at least) trip to Singapore. It's still under repair, and we are still waiting for it to come back.\n", "Q: Can you actually use Terminal to crash your computer? People who don't understand Terminal are often afraid to use it for fear that they might mess up their command and crash their computer. Those who know Terminal better know that that's not the case - usually Terminal will just output an error. But are there actually commands that will crash your computer?  \nWARNING: you could lose data if you type these or copy paste, especially sudo and rm commands.\n\nA: sudo kill -9 -1  \n\nI accidently performed a kill -9 -1 in a perl-script, running as root.\nThat was as fast, as pulling the power-cord. On reboot, the server made a filesystem-check and continued running properly.\nI never tried that sudo kill -9 -1 command on the commandline. It might not work, because the process-ID \"-1\" means \"kill all processes that belongs to the caller's process-group\".  \nNot sure, if with sudo, that also means init and all the kernel-stuff... \nBut if you are root, kill -9 -1 will definitely make an immediate stop - just like pulling the power-cord. \nBy the way - nothing will appear in logfiles, because that command is the fastest killer in the west!  \nActually, to recover, I went to our sysadmins and told them, what I did. They did a hard reboot, because there was no way to log in on that server (RHEL6).\nA kill -9 -1 as root kills every process, that runs as root. That is i.e. sshd. That logged me out immediately and prevented anyone from logging in again.  Any process started by init - including init have been killed, unless they changed UID or GID. Even logging in through serial console wasn't possible any more. ps -eaf | grep root shows some fancy processes, which, if they react on a SIGKILL in the default way, would pretty much stop even basic writing to HD.  \nI will not try this now on my laptop :-) I am not curious enough to finding out, if a kill -9 165 ([ext4-rsv-conver]) would really stop writing to the HD.\n\nA: Sure, make sure you have a backup and save any files you care about, then type halt\nAssuming you then use sudo to be root, the Mac will crash. \nThe biggest risk from command line is data loss. The macOS interface is designed over decades to not surprise people and shred their data or settings or apps. The macOS graphical interface also exists to remove the learning curve (a steep one) to being safe and mastering shell scripting. \nYou lose those protections which is why I caution people starting with terminal app or ssh. If you have a backup you know works and have the time and confidence/skill to perform a restore, then you should dive in and learn and even break things. \n\nA: One way to crash a computer is to execute a so called fork-bomb. \nYou can execute it on a unix-sytem by:\n:(){ :|: & };:\n\nIt's a command that will recursively spawn processes till the OS is so busy it won't respond to any action anymore.\n\nA: Yes, you can completely destroy your system. Accidentally doing something with sudo privileges is one example that has been posted, whether it's forgetting a few characters that instruct the terminal to do something completely different than you intended. rming / instead of /tmp/\\* is only a 5 character difference. Putting a space in the wrong place could do something completely different as well. Other times, seemingly well meaning instructions could have malicious code obfuscated into it. Some people on the internet are very good at obfuscating code.\nThere are also commands that, using html, can be made font size zero, so something completely innocuous looking, when copied to the clipboard, could in fact be installing someone's git repo as a trusted source and downloading malware. \nAnd there are commands that you can run that open you to exploit, or that could be perfectly well intended but removes important files or programs or corrupts your disk. In fact, using tools incorrectly could do something as basic as accidentally writing over your boot sector, or the head of your disk, or lots of other issues.\nAn example of something less destructive that hasn't been posted is opening binary files in vi. If you've ever tried it, you'll know that it can mess up your terminal to the point that it's unusable until it is reset.\nAlternatively, there are commands that will bog down your machine, like:\nyes >> /dev/null & yes >> /dev/null & yes >> /dev/null & yes >> /dev/null & \n\nYou can try that one, it's not going to do damage, but it will bog down your processor, and you'll have to kill each process you've spawned.\nThat being said, in computing it's generally taken that you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. You should be cautious at the terminal, but the only way that one can become better at using the OS is by learning and practicing.\n\nA: Not sure what you mean about 'crash'ing the computer - if you would re-phrase it to say 'render the computer unusable', then yes.  Certainly all it takes is a single stray command - just a moment where you're not thinking clearly about what you're doing, similar to when you speak without thinking, and the damage can be immense and almost immediate.  The classic example:\n$ sudo rm -rf /\n\nIf you let that command run for even just one second, that can wipe out enough of your system to render it unbootable, and possibly cause irreversible data loss.  Don't do it.\n\nA: I am only a bash beginner, but you could use something like this:\nwhile True; do COMMAND; done;\nMost people would try to use Ctrl+C to stop the command, not the external process (Ctrl+Z, which then need to be killed).\nIf the command in the while True loop is a resource-intensive operation (such as multiplying large number to its own power), that could mess with your system resources and bog down your processor. However, modern operating systems are usually protected against such catastrophes.\n\nA: Suppose you don't know what your doing and attempting to do a backup of some hard drive \ndd if=/dev/disk1 of=/dev/disk2 \n\nWell if you mix those up (switch if and of), it will overwrite the fresh data with old data, no questions asked.\nSimilar mix ups can happen with archive utils. And frankly with most command line utilities.\nIf you want an example of a one character mix up that will crash your system take a look at this scenario: You want to move all the files in the current directory to another one:\n mv -f ./* /path/to/other/dir\n\nLet's accept the fact that you learned to use ./ to denote the current directory. (I do)\nWell if you omit the dot, it will start moving all your files. Including your system files. You are lucky you didn't sudo this. But if you read somewhere that with 'sudo -i' you will never again have to type in sudo you are logged in as root now. And now your system is eating itself in front of your very eyes.\nBut again I think stuff like overwriting my precious code files with garbage, because I messed up one character or because I mixed up the order of parameters, is more trouble.\nLet's say I want to check out the assembler code that gcc is generating:\ngcc -S program.c > program.s\n\nSuppose I already had a program.s and I use TAB completion. I am in a hurry and forget to TAB twice:\ngcc -S program.c > program.c\n\nNow I have the assembler code in my program.c and no c code anymore.\nWhich is at least a real setback for some, but to others it's start-over-from-scratch-time.\nI think these are the ones that will cause real \"harm\". I don't really care if my system crashes. I would care about my data being lost.\nUnfortunately these are the mistakes that will have to be made until you learn to use the terminal with the proper precautions.\n\nA: It's a little ambiguous what you mean by \"crash\" your computer... and there's no definitive correct answer for that, although there's some useful examples in other answers. Since your question is more ambiguous and general, I'd like to focus on the nature of the question and give a more general answer.\n\nPeople who don't understand Terminal are often afraid to use it for fear that they might mess up their command and crash their computer\n\nI think the command line is a double-edged sword, and often a very sharp one. Its greatest strength is also its biggest weakness for new users: CLI programs do what you say, without asking if it's really what you meant. They often don't ask for confirmation, they don't provide hand-holding or interactive help, and their options are short, often terse, sometimes confusing text-based strings. Note that they are generally very well documented, one just has to read the manual page for it (which is almost always man <command name>) and take the time to understand what the command they are going to run will do.\nThis mode of operation is powerful -- it means that seasoned CLI users can craft long command \"pipelines\" which do complex tasks with single commands. This is because the task won't ask \"Are you sure?\" every step of the way, it does what it's told. But for a user unfamiliar with this mode, and used to a GUI where online help is a click away, it's unfamiliar and scary.\n\nBut are there actually commands that will crash your computer?\n\nCan you \"crash\" your computer using the CLI? Maybe. You can certainly cause data loss if you use a destructive command incorrectly. E.G. many of the answers here mention rm, a command which deletes files. Obviously, you can cause data loss with that command, it's what the command was designed to do.\nAs other answers have pointed out, you can use the command line to render your machine virtually unusable for a period of time: you can shut down without confirmation, cause a process to use 100% of your available resources without confirmation, kill all your programs or destroy your filesystem. If you really wanted to, you could use the CLI to craft a kernel extension which causes the kernel to panic (which is the closest to a \"crash\" I can think of).\nThe command line (accessed via the Terminal) is a powerful tool. Often it's faster to solve a problem using Terminal than the GUI. Some operations are only available using Terminal commands. However, the key to the CLI is understanding. Don't execute random commands you see online. Read the man pages and understand what commands do. If you're unsure, ask someone or learn more about a command before running it.\n\nA: Surely you still can cause a system crash using commands entered with Terminal.\nWith years it's getting harder probably due to all kinds of limits and protective measures applied but as Murphy's-like law states: \"Nothing is foolproof to a sufficiently capable fool.\"\n\"Fork bombs\" and all that rm -rf script kiddies stuff are anciently known things for UNIX. With Mac OS X you can have more fun using its GUI sub-system parts (WindowServer to mention) or something like OpenBSD firewall aka PF that Apple's engineers brought in but never managed to update since its 2008 state of things. PF works in kernel so when it catches a quirk it's time Apple tells you \"you restarted computer due to a panic\" or stuff like this.\nThe worst part of this is you never can have an idea of where-n-why it panicked —\n cause Apple doesn't provide any meaningful stack traces; you can only have hex numbers of stack frame's return addresses.\n\nA: Causing a kernel panic is a more akin to crashing than the other answers I've seen here thus far:\nsudo dtrace -w -n \"BEGIN{ panic();}\"\n\n(code taken from here and also found in Apple's own documentation)\nYou might also try:\nsudo killall kernel_task\n\nI haven't verified that the second one there actually works (and I don't intend to as I actually have some work open right now).\n\nA: Modern macOS makes it really hard to crash your machine as an unprivileged user (i.e. without using sudo), because UNIX systems are meant to handle thousands of users without letting any of them break the whole system. So, thankfully, you'll usually have to be prompted before you do something that destroys your machine.\nUnfortunately, that protection only applies to the system itself. As xkcd illustrates, there's lots of stuff that you care about that isn't protected by System Integrity Protection, root privileges or password prompts:\n\nSo, there's tons of stuff you can type in that will just wreck your user account and all your files if you aren't careful. A few examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*rm -rf ${TEMPDIR}/*. This seems totally reasonable, until you realize that the environment variable is spelt TMPDIR. TEMPDIR is usually undefined, which makes this rm -rf /. Even without sudo, this will happily remove anything you have delete permissions to, which will usually include your entire home folder. If you let this run long enough, it'll nuke any drive connected to your machine, too, since you usually have write permissions to those.\n\n*find ~ -name \"TEMP*\" -o -print | xargs rm. find will normally locate files matching certain criteria and print them out. Without the -o this does what you'd expect and deletes every file starting with TEMP* (as long as you don't have spaces in the path). But, the -o means \"or\" (not \"output\" as it does for many other commands!), causing this command to actually delete all your files. Bummer.\n\n*ln -sf link_name /some/important/file. I get the syntax for this command wrong occasionally, and it will rather happily overwrite your important file with a useless symbolic link.\n\n*kill -9 -1 will kill every one of your programs, logging you out rather quickly and possibly causing data loss.\n\n\nA: Another one you can do (that I have done by mistake before) is:\nsudo chmod 0 /\n\nThis will render your entire file system (which means all commands and programs) unaccessible...except by the root user. This means you would need to log in directly as the root user and restore the file system, BUT you are unable to access the sudo command (or any other command, for that matter). You can restore access to commands and files by booting into single-user mode, mounting and restoring the file system with chmod 755 /. \nIf this is done recursively with chmod -R 0 / then this will render the system unusable. The proper fix at that point is to use Disk Utility from the recovery partition to repair disk permissions. You may be better off just to restore a snapshot or backup of your file system if this was run recursively.\n\nA: Answers that call sudo should be considered invalid. These already assume\nadministrative access to the system.\nTry perl -e 'exit if fork;for(;;){fork;}'. OSX may have some safeguard against this now. If is presents an apple bubble asking if you want to terminate Terminal app and subprocesses, you're (almost) good. \nwhile true ; do cat /dev/zero > /dev/null & done is also very handy, esp. if you don't have perl.\nfor i in 1 2 3 4 ; do cat /dev/zero > /dev/null & done will just do a funny little CPU load test. Very good for checking if your heatsink and fan are up to par.\n", "Q: Power suply Watts and charging time - Apple iphone I understand that a device only draws as much current as it needs. So assuming the power supply and the device have the same voltage (5V), using a power supply able to provide more amperage (= more watts) will not change anything.\nHowever if the power supply can't provide enough current (nominal current of the device), that will either overheat the supply and/or the voltage in the circuit will drop.\nAlso regarding the voltage it is important that it be the same.\n\n\n*\n\n*If that of the power supply is higher than the device, the current in the circuit will be too high (assuming the power supply can supply this new level of amperage) with a risk of frying the device.\n\n*if that of the power supply is lower, then the device might not be working properly as not enough current circulates inside.\nMy question is regarding the statement that new iphones can be charged with both the 5W and 12W charger, the charging time being faster with the latter.\nHow comes? To me either the 5W matches the device's inputs and the 12W shouldn't change anything, that is, it works but not faster. Or the 12W is the correct one but then it would mean that with the 5W the power provided is too low and we are in the case explained at the top where the power supply rating is below the device requirements, which can create issues.\nThe only explanation I can think of is that the circuit in iphone is more complex and somewhat intelligent with variable internal resistances to regulate the amperage and adapt to the power supply specs. Would that be correct?\n\nA: Apple chargers have distinctive \"charger signatures\", in a form of different voltage combination on D+ and D- lines, see for example this answer, and many-many similar answers. That's how an Apple device \"knows\" what is the power capability of a particular charger, and takes more current (by changing input parameters of their internal battery charger) and therefore charges faster from a 12W charger than from a 5W charger.\n\nA: \nThe only explanation I can think of is that the circuit in iphone is more complex and somewhat intelligent with variable internal resistances to regulate the amperage and adapt to the power supply specs. Would that be correct?\n\nYes. Modern phones have intelligent power management. The iPhone can charge at various rates depending on what they believe they are connected to. They will only charge at <500 mA when connected to a USB host they have negotiated with. When the charger uses Apple's 1 Amp charger resistor signaling, they charge at that rate, and when it uses the 2.1 Amp charger resistor signaling, they charge at a faster rate. They can also charge faster when connected to a Mac's usb port due to special kernel modules that Apple has written for themselves.\nThey do not charge at a uncontrolled rate. They also specifically refuse to charge from non-apple standard chargers unless they have usb enumeration. So you cannot simply connect 5V and Gnd and charge them.\n\nA: 5W charger is 5V 1A.\n12W charger is 5V 2.4A.\nIf the device max input current is 1A, then using both charger will give you the same time to charge from 0 to 100%. However if the device max input is 2.4A, then using the 1A charger will be way slower than a 2.4A charger.\n\nA: The long answer to the question is an app note: Introduction to USB Power Delivery Applications.\nIn short, mobile devices that use USB for battery charging \"negotiate\" current with the DC power supply 1 which provides +5V on USB.  The mobile doesn't simply draw the maximum current that it can to draw.  At the beginning of negotiation, the mobile will draw no more than 100mA (any USB port is required to provide at least 100mA).  If the mobile draws more than a USB port can provide, then a breaker inside the port would trip, and the USB the port would disconnect, which is a inconvenience.\n1 Among lay consumers2, the wall adapter which supplies +5V through the USB jack is called \"charger\".  But that's just a DC power supply.  The actual charge controller for the battery is inside of the mobile device.\n2 How's that for gender neutrality?\n", "Q: NUMBERS: Lookup hourly rental rate based on date of transaction I have a resource that has an hourly rental rate. That hourly rate has changed (increased) over time. To capture that rate history, I have created a table with the date of the rate change and the new rate that looks like this:\nDate of rate change     | Rate\n2015-01-01              | $60\n2017-01-01              | $65\n2017-07-13              | $68\nI am trying to create a formula that will look up the hourly rate based on the date of the transaction/rental and then determine what the rental rate would have been on that date. I figure there must be some way to do this with a vlookup but from the documentation, it looks like that function requires an exact match and I want to match based on the input date being after the date in the lookup table not an exact date. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: Ok, so now had chance to test, use this formula :\n=IF(C2<=A4,B4,IF(C2<=A3,B3,IF(C2<=A2,B2)))\n\nThe date tested is in cell C2 and the three dates are in A2, A3 and A4, while the three rates are in B2, B3 and B4.\nThe logic has been reversed ie test for the oldest date first.\nYou could also use names for the 3 rates, but it will work the same.\n", "Q: IPV6 ip address not able to connect from my app when NAT64/DNS64 is connected SetUp Details :- \nIpV4 ethernet cable is connected to MAC machine.

I only want to move the file into it, not see the contents.   \nIs there a way to stop this?\nI am running macOS Sierra 10.12.5.\n\nA: The feature you're referring to is called Spring Loaded Folders. Folders should only spring open if you hover (or pause) over a folder for a second or so (depending on your settings). \nIn other words, if you drag and drop files from your Desktop into Folder A you would let go of the mouse button as soon as your pointer is over Folder A, rather than pausing over it for too long.\nYou can adjust your settings as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Accessibility\n\n*In the left-hand sidebar, find and select the Mouse & Trackpad option.\n\n*Now use the slider to adjust the Spring-loaded delay time.\n\n\nNOTE: If you wish to disable the Spring-loaded folder feature, you can remove the checkmark next to the slider.\n\nA: Turning off the spring-loaded folders didn't work for me.

Run Apple Diagnostics (see below). \n\n*If the problem is not present during Safe Mode then it's time to investigate login items, fonts, and kernel extensions. If that's the case, proceed to 2. Investigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions (see below).\n\n\n\n1. Run Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MacBook Pro\n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nIf you get an error let me know the results. If you get no error, skip to 3. Some suggestions re Google Chrome, Photoshop and macOS Sierra.\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \n\n2. Investigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions\nLet's start with Login Items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup normally\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Take a note of your Login Items \n\n*Now remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the - button below\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n\nNow your Mac will boot up without those login items loading. Test this and see if the problem persists: \n\n\n*\n\n*If the problem goes away you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved.\n\n*If the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:\n\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\n\n3. Some suggestions re Google Chrome, Photoshop and macOS Sierra\nI would try the following suggestions to see if they have any impact on what's going on.\nGoogle Chrome\nI would strongly consider not using Chrome for a few days as a test. However, if you need to, there’s actually a setting in Google Chrome that may help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Chrome > Preferences\n\n*Scroll down to the bottom\n\n*Click on Show advanced settings…\n\n*Scroll down to the System heading\n\n*Uncheck the Use hardware acceleration when available option\n\n\nAdobe Photoshop\nLikewise, you may be able to tinker with Photoshop’s settings as well. Depending on the version you use, if you go to Photoshop’s Preferences and look under the Performance category, there should be a section for GPU Settings. By going into its Advanced Settings you may be able to try different options for the mode of use. It will probably default to Normal, but you could change it to Basic and see whether Photoshop plays more nicely with your MBP. Under GPU settings you could also switch off OpenGL Drawing altogether, but that may limit some functionality.\nmacOS Sierra\nThere are a couple of things you can do within Sierra:\n\n\n*\n\n*You’re probably already aware of this one – but for your MBP you should have an additional setting under System Preferences > Energy Saver for Automatic graphics switching. Playing with this and the other Graphics option (for better battery life) may be useful.\n\n*Now this one is not so obvious:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Click on Accessibility\n\n*Select Display (in the left-hand column)\n\n*Tick the Reduce transparency box (on the right-hand side)\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\n\nAfter making these changes, use your Mac long enough to see what difference, if any, they make. This is basically a troubleshooting step to help narrow down the possible cause of your problem, so let me know how you go.\n\nA: Here is something else to check if you've been through all the troubleshooting without success — or if you see this error message:\n\nRoot disk errors: \"Could not recover SATA HDD after 5 attempts.\n  Terminating.\"\n\nThis is an odd error message considering modern MacBook Pro machines use SSD instead of HDD for storage. It turns out that there is an Energy Saver setting to put the drive to sleep when possible. This was helpful when there were physical spinning platters but doesn't make sense with solid state drives. Try turning off this setting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Energy Saver\n\n*Untick Put hard disks to sleep when possible on both the Battery and Power Adapter tab.\nThank you to Mike Schubert for this solution!\n", "Q: How did Siri know where this plane was going? The other day something creepy happened to me. My anti-Apple friend has been trying to convince me for some time that Apple are spying on all their users. To prove her point she used my iPhone to ask Siri where a plane in the sky was flying to. And Siri answered that it was going to Delhi. I said that Siri likes to joke around and she was probably just joking. My friend then said if I didn’t believe it, just check the flight schedules. Sure enough, this morning I checked and a flight was scheduled to leave Toronto for Delhi at the time she asked Siri the question. I don’t believe Apple is spying on me, but how did Siri know about that flight?!?!\n\nA: Actually this is nothing new and isn’t all that creepy (although I suppose that depends on what you consider to be creepy).\nSiri has been closely integrated with the WolframAlpha Computational Knowledge Engine for many years now. \nTo determine where a plane flying overhead is going, Siri only needs to send a request along the lines of flights seen from current geoIP location to WolframAlpha. WolframAlpha then returns the details to Siri, such as where the flight is going, the flight number, type of plane, altitude, etc. \nFor this to work you must already have Settings > Privacy > Location Services switched on - so if you have any concerns about revealing your location then you should check these settings and which apps you're sharing your location with.\nIf you're interested in learning more about WolframAlpha, you can refer to Wikipedia’s WolframAlpha entry. This provides a great overview, including the fact that other devices (such as some Android devices) also use it.\nIn summary: Apple isn't spying on you. All that is happening is your iPhone is sending its geolocation to WolframAlpha which in turn is using data provided to it from another third party to return the flight information back to Siri. This is nothing new and some Android devices can also do the same thing.\n\nA: No, this example is not Siri or Apple spying on you - there is even a app you can get for Ipad that will show you all the flights in the sky above you (even if you don't see them) and clicking on them will give you the info.\nMind you, some are classed as military and you only get an ID number if you are lucky.\n", "Q: Can't remove ACE from directory My applications folder has an ACE entry which prevents me from deleting its contents (not even as root, with sip disabled).\nMy problem is, that the command\nsudo chmod -N /Applications\ntells me, that I have no permission to do this.\nI couldn't believe it and tried it in both single user and recovery mode, to no avail.\nOutput of ls -leO:\ndrwxrwxr-x+ 148 root    admin  uappnd,nodump,opaque  4.9K Jul 31 08:55 Applications/\n0: group:everyone deny delete\n\nIs there any other possibility to fix this except from reinstalling the OS?\n\nA: The proper command to remove the ACE from the folder in SIP-disabled mode is:\nsudo chmod -a \"everyone deny delete\" /Applications\n\nYou can also remove (or add) ACL entries by number/index:\nsudo chmod -a# 0 /Applications\n\n", "Q: Google Maps: mark road as Closed on iPhone/mobile (Directions) Is there a way to mark a road as Closed in Google Maps Directions on a mobile phone (iPhone but likely to be the same on Android)?\nSo that the itinerary is changed, avoiding that closed road.\n\nNote1 on the desktop version the road is to be \"report as closed\", but didn't see that on the mobile version.\nNote2 any other solution that makes Maps avoid that road is welcome as well.\n\nA: Unfortunately you can’t report a road closure when using directions.\nYou can do it by going in Contribute tab > Edit map > Report a problem with map data > Selected the road > “Closed Road”.\nNote that it won’t be closed on the map until an employee verifies it manually (it can take up to a month).\nAs @chenmunka suggested it you can also report it as closed on Waze, some of the closures are shared to Google Maps.\n", "Q: /etc/profile not being sourced for login shells The -l flag to sh is supposed to source the contents of /etc/profile and other profile scripts like ~/.profile, which generally provide the initial set of environment variables for a login session.\nWith that in mind, I run the command env -i sh -l -c env and expect to see a fresh environment plus the changes made by /etc/profile. However, /etc/profile is never sourced, despite this being the supposed behaviour of the -l flag. On other non-MacOS systems, this -l flag causes /etc/profile to be loaded correctly.\nWhy does this not work on MacOS, and how can I ensure that the profile scripts are correctly sourced in the right order as they would be on login? (Note that I do not want an interactive shell session)\n\nA: Unlike other systems, sh is its own compiled binary as if you called bash --posix. From the Bash Reference Manual:\nThe POSIX startup files are executed ($ENV) rather than the normal Bash files.\n\nenv -i strips every environment variable. Even adding it back as env -i ENV=/etc/profile does not work.\nInstead of sh just use bash:\nenv -i bash -l -c env\n\n", "Q: Cut and delete a row in Apple Numbers in a single step In Apple Numbers, I think that I cut the content and deleted a row at the simultaneously in a single step. I did that by accident, but then I could not reproduce it. I have been searching but I cannot find any command.\nI know I can:\n- command ⌘+X (cut the content of a row)\n- Table > Delete Row (or go to the arrow on the left and Delete Row)\nCan I do those two things in one step using the keyboard? \nThis is something that I have to do many, many times and it would be very useful. Is it possible?\n\nA: I have tried to duplicate your Cut/Delete Row with a single key combination but without creating an AppleScript I don't see a way.\nHowever, as Delete Row is in the menu, one could make a custom keyboard shortcut to Delete the selected row after cutting the contents to the clipboard.\n\nTo create a shortcut specifically to delete a row in Numbers:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences either from LaunchPad, the Dock or using Spotlight to find it.\n\n*Select the Keyboard preferences\n\n*Select the Shortcuts tab\n\n*In the Left Pane select App Shortcuts\n\n*Beneath the Right Pane click the Plus icon to add a shortcut [+]\n\n*From the Application dropdown, select Numbers\n\n*In the Menu Tile Type the menu command exactly as it appears in Numbers: Delete Row\n\n*For the Keyboard Shortcut type the shortcut you wish to use taking care not to conflict with other shortcuts used in Numbers.  For example option ⌥+command ⌘+X\nOnce this has been added, select your row, type ⌘+X to Cut the contents to the clipboard, then option ⌥+command ⌘+X to delete the row.  It requires the addition of one extra key stroke but will become second nature with muscle memory.\nThe demo below shows this method.  The contents are then pasted back showing they were cut to the clipboard before deleting the row.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Identify why I get a connection to ransomware server I received some waring that my 'PC' might be infected because it supposedly tried to connect to two ransomware server:\nhttp://45.33.9.234/\nhttp://79.170.40.167/\n\nIn practice I have a MBP with MacOS 10.12.6  Malwarebytes cannot find anything.

Get little snitch and keep an eye on what is doing what?  any other way to scan the system that is better than Malwarebytes?  Any log I can look into?\n\nA: You receive this message when switching to only this network because it is likely your IT dept have a monitoring tool set upon it, which is using an API with this IP blacklisted for ransomware activity\nThe problem is this IP is shared across thousands of URLs and only a select few may be associated with ransomware\n\nA: Ok, so Little Snitch identified where the connections come from -- my RSS reader (Vienna).  The questions is, can one be infected with ransomware or allied annoyances because the RSS feed reader connects to a site that has something to do with said ransomware?\nPS for those curious to know, the feed are:\nwww.thejoinersapprentice.com\nwww.holteyplanes.com\n\nThe first site seems to be dead but the second is alive and apparently 100% legit.\n", "Q: Is there a limit to the number of USB and Serial to USB devices my Macbook Pro can connect? I'm curious if there is a limit to the number of usb and serial to usb devices my Mac can connect to. I've got a 2015 Macbook Pro running 10.10.5 and I'm writing a python program to connect to a bunch of serial devices which I have connected to a USB hub. I have four devices on one hub and then two on another. My computer seems to have some weird issues when I connect to all of them and chat with them over serial. Any idea about limits here?\n\nA: No, but if you connect too many devices through USB hubs, but, as @patrix mentioned, you might experience slower data transfer rates and delays.\n", "Q: Two persons simultaneously using one MacBook Pro (working in two apps simultaneous ) Is it possible for such a setup as the following: Hooking one MacBook Pro up with two separate monitors, allowing two different persons to work independently on their monitors, sharing the computer's performance?\nPerhaps this is a strange request, but it would actually be useful for me in certain situations. (I will be working in one monitor and in the another one my daughter will be playing.) I ask cause I do not know how focus will work in this situation. \n\nA: Two people using the same graphical user session, with different input devices, is not possible on macOS.\nRemote Session - VNC\nHowever, you can remote log into a Mac and share the computer's performance. Remote log in will give you two graphical user sessions running on one Mac.\nYou could use an inexpensive computer, such as a Raspberry Pi, and have it remotely connect to your MacBook Pro. One user could then use the Mac directly and the other via the remote connection and a monitor.\n", "Q: How can I add a city to my list and create a corresponding if-then string? My current code:\nproperty cityList : {\"City A\",\"City B\",\"City C\",\"New City\"}\nchoose from list cityList with prompt \"Choose your city:\"\nset choice to result\nif choice is not false then set city to choice\nif choice is false then error number -128\n\nif (city as string) is \"City A\" then\n    set lat to 1\n    set lon to 1\nelse if (city as string) is \"City B\" then\n    set lat to 1\n    set lon to 1\nelse if (city as string) is \"City C\" then\n    set lat to 1\n    set lon to 1\nelse if (city as string) is \"New City\" then\n    set lat to my customLat()\n    set lon to my customLon()\n    set city to my customCity()\n    set x to the length of cityList\n    set the end of cityList to \"New City\"\n    copy city as string to item x of cityList\nend if\n\n--script that does things based on values of lat and lon\n\nwhere customLat() is a subroutine that prompts the user for a latitude, tries to coerce it to a number and outputs an error if it can't, and outputs another error if said number is not between -90 and 90, and customLon() is a similar one, but it tests for between -180 and 180 instead. In either case, if an error is returned, it prompts the user for the relevant number once more. customCity() merely prompts the user for the city's name. \nMy problem is what to type in after the copy city line. Is there a way to add an if block in my code - that is, have the code write on top of itself - based on the result of the \"New City\" if block? That is, once the code has established the variables city, lat, and lon, it will then insert before the end if line a similar block to the previous cities:\nelse if (city as string) is \"Newly Inputted City\" then\n    set lat to 1\n    set lon to 1\n\nI am looking for a way that the user can input a custom city and coordinates, and the code will overwrite itself to allow that as a valid option, so that the next time the script is run the custom city will be available as an option, and selecting it will automatically set its lat and lon, just like the other cities. \n\nA: Your code doesn’t need to rewrite itself. else already takes care of all cases that are unaccounted for:\nproperty cityList : {\"City A\", \"City B\", \"City C\", \"New City\"}\nset choice to choose from list cityList with prompt \"Choose your city:\"\nif choice is false then\n    error number -128\nend if\n\nset city to choice as string\nif city is \"New City\" then\n    set lat to my customLat()\n    set lon to my customLon()\n    set city to my customCity()\n    set x to the length of cityList\n    set the end of cityList to \"New City\"\n    copy city to item x of cityList\nelse\n    set lat to 1\n    set lon to 1\nend if\n\n\nA: Adding lines to a script is possible, but it is very complicated and unnecessary.\nYou only need two lists, cities and coordinates.\nSimply use a loop to get the city index in the list, and use that index to get the coordinates in the other list.\nHere's the script:\nproperty myRecord : {cityList:{\"City A\", \"City B\", \"City C\", \"New City\"}, coordinates:{{1, 1}, {1, 1}, {1, 1}}}\n\nset choice to choose from list (cityList of myRecord) with prompt \"Choose your city:\"\nif choice is false then error number -128\nset city to item 1 of choice -- the class of choice is a list, this list contains one item\n\nif city is \"New City\" then\n    set lat to my customLat()\n    set lon to my customLon()\n    set city to my customCity()\n\n    tell (cityList of myRecord)\n        set last item to city -- replace the last item in the cityList\n        set end to \"New City\" -- append \"New City\" to cityList\n    end tell\n    set end of (coordinates of myRecord) to {lat, lon} -- append a list in the 'coordinates' list\n\nelse -- the city is not \"New City\"\n    tell myRecord\n        set len to (length of its cityList) - 1 -- ***    -1 to skip the last item (\"New City\")   ****\n        repeat with i from 1 to len\n            if (item i of its cityList) = city then -- the index of the city in the 'cityList' is i\n                set {lat, lon} to item i of its coordinates -- I use the index to get the latitude and the longitude in the 'coordinates' list\n                exit repeat\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend if\nlog {lat, lon}\n--script that does things based on values of lat and lon\n\n\nNote : I use a record in the script, but you can use two properties if you prefer:\nproperty cityList : {\"City A\", \"City B\", \"City C\", \"New City\"}\nproperty coordinates : {{1, 1}, {1, 1}, {1, 1}}\n\n", "Q: Showing two mouse cursors? Whats up with this?:\n \nWhen I have a mouse cursor size that is bigger than the actual mouse, this shows up. Please help! It is really annoying and it makes my computer lag. It does not survive a reboot, but right when someone else logs into my computer or I log out and then log back in, it starts again.\n\nA: One issue could possibly be with the Shake mouse pointer to locate.\nTo turn it off:\nGo into System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Display.\nUncheck the option: Shake mouse pointer to locate.\nThis might fix it but I'm not sure.\n\n\nA: Because this only happens in your user account we can be pretty confident it's being caused by something in your user account. Do you know if you've installed any kind of program that would change the way OS X looks, maybe a cursor program..?\nYou can try Safe Boot as well by restarting your Mac and holding down the Shift key as it boots. Safe mode uses only required kernel extensions and disables login items, as well as emptying some system caches. If the problem doesn't happen in Safe Boot we'll know for sure that it's one of these issues. If it's a login item you can clear these out in System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items. If it's a cache issue these are usually fixed just by going into Safe Boot. If it's a kext that's a little more complicated but I can show you a method to find out which one it is.\n", "Q: Macbook pro locked/disabled My Macbook pro got disabled. I tried to go into the recovery mode using cmd+R and internet recovery mode using cmd+opt+R. Both ask for my firmware password, and when I enter the password,although correct, it takes me back to disabled screen. Find my Iphone app says my Macbook is locked.In addition I tried to reinstall OS through bootable installer but that too takes me back to the disabled screen.\n\n\nA: This lock is by design. It allows the owner to prevent anyone that can’t prove they own the hardware from getting Apple or other service professionals to erase the lock. \nSee https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my-iphone/ and especially the Mac link at the bottom. \nYou now have a firmware password on that Mac preventing you from changing the OS to boot from other sources. You can either enter the passcode that was created to lock the hardware or follow the normal process when you forget a firmware password by seeking authorized service. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455\n\nA: If you are indeed locked out due to the FirmwarePasswordUtility preventing you from Internet Recovery mode, and cannot manage figuring out what your password is, there is still a last resort option.\nAssuming you do actually own, and can prove you own the Mac, an official Apple Store can remove the firmware password and help you with restoring the computer to working condition.\n\nA: You can do the startup that takes you to disk utility to get to terminal and type in the terminal command to reset your login password. \n", "Q: macOS filesystem corrupted after spliting disk in Windows. How to fix? I've installed macOS Sierra and then Windows 10 on the second partition. I've decided to split Windows partition to another 2 partitions and it doesn't work. Splitting executed using standard Windows disk management utility. Before splitting I've got message that \"Your disks become dynamic...\" something like this. Have clicked Yes anyway and splitting didn't done, but in disk management partitions become another color. Windows still running until rebooting. Then it won't boot with error \"Something wrong with your PC. Try to reboot again\". Autofixing problems, check disk etc. didn't help at all. macOS disappeared from boot menu and now has RAW filesystem. I guess splitting disk corrupted its filesystem. Is there a way to back macOS to boot menu? It seems RAW filesystem have to be converted to GPT someway. macOS is on G: partition. Please help.\n\nUPD: TestDisk util restored Windows10 boot. So how now restore macOS?\n\n\nA: There is a way I fix this. This is the simplest solution you may use in case you have backup of Windows files and macOS files using via Time Machine or external drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a backup image of restored Windows partition. If Windows didn't restore yet use TestDisk util. Example of restoring.\n\n*Boot your Mac in recovery mode and there you'll have option to reinstall macOS or to restore from Time Machine. You're lucky if you have backup. However on my 2011 late MacBook I've got Sierra macOS option to install, instead of default MacOS Lion. This saved me a hour of time to update from Lion to Sierra.\nNOTE: that installing macOS again will erase your Windows disk. Therefore we made a bit-to-bit backup on step 1.\n\n*After installing Sierra you have an ability to reinstall Windows via Bootcamp.  If your Mac newer than 2012 that supports Windows 10 installation you can skip this step. My late MacBook Pro 2011 doesn't support Windows 10 by Bootcamp, so I need to do a trick by installing Windows 7 first. Then convert MBR record from Hybrid to Protective (Win10 doesn't support Hybrid). And only then install Windows 10. Read this perfect post for details.\n\n*Restore Windows 10 from backup we've created on step 1. You have to boot in the recovery mode of Windows and go to Restore from backup step. \n\n\nNot sure this is the fastest way to restore, but I didn't find another one. This took over 4-5 hours to get back to normal state of booting macOS or Windows 10 on my old MacBook. And get a lesson that to DO NOT SPLIT disk when you have more than one OS installed.\n", "Q: Does secure erase through Terminal affect old user accounts? I had some problems with an old user account on a Macbook Pro with SSD, and I wanted to start fresh. I am not sure if I deleted the account, but I think I did reinstall the OS through I think internet recovery mode. The old account is not present in Users & Groups.\nI did \nMy-MacBook-Pro-2:Desktop accoutname$ sudo diskutil secureErase \nfreespace 0 /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD\n\nand the following is the response I got from Terminal:\nStarted erase on disk1 Macintosh HD\nCreating a temporary file\nSecurely erasing a file\nCreating a secondary temporary file\nMounting disk\nFinished erase on disk1 Macintosh HD\n\nIn Disk Utility there are two Macintosh HD's shown, the top one with '0 Bytes Available' and the bottom indented one with 180 GB available. Did both of these HD's with the same name get erased by my Terminal command? \nFileVault is enabled on the current account but not sure if it was on the old account. Either way I know FileVault isn't totally foolproof (https://www.blackbagtech.com/blog/2017/07/13/macquisition-best-just-got-better/), and since I'm not 100% sure how the old account was deleted, I just wanted to ask if my current method through Terminal makes the data on the old account non recoverable? Any other steps I should take? \n\nA: Everything you describe seems to be just fine. To be totally sure I would re-enable FileVault and then cycle the keys (boot to recovery HD and erase the FV volume.) That ensures that each \"block\" is cryptographically scrubbed before you then re-introduce a new OS and then turn on FileVault2.\nThe main lesson to keep in mind is with SSD - be sure to enable FileVault before you put anything secure on the drive. That way when SSD swaps in new \"excess capacity\" blocks to replace others - you don't get old plain text data restored or have plain text data taken \"offline\" only to be possibly be put into service after you do the \"wipe\".\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH22241\nThe key phrase is:\n\nNote: With a solid-state drive (SSD), secure erase options are not available in Disk Utility. For more security, consider turning on FileVault encryption when you start using your SSD drive.\n\n", "Q: 2016 Touch Bar MBP drains battery in sleep A full battery will drain in about 24 hours of lid closed, fully unplugged sleep.

The wake event didn't correspond with notifications or anything else discernible. I talked with an Apple Genius today an he started to remove the sleepimage but found a lot of permission issues with it, eventually dropping into Single User mode to get the job done. When I explained all the issues I've had with sleep, he said \"this could cause that,\" but I have a feeling that their go-to level 1 solution for sleep/wake issues is deleting the sleepimage.  \n\nA: I don't know much on deciphering console.log messages but if your machine is physically warm and losing that much battery it has not actually been asleep. It is normal for OS X to wake up every few hours & perform some background tasks but under typical use it should be asleep again within minutes. Yours is definitely doing more than the average machine while asleep. \nI wonder what the results would be if you created a new (completely blank) user in System Preferences > Users & Groups, logged out of yours, logged into that user & then put it to sleep for another day or so. If you see that the machine is no longer waking up & for whatever reason not going back to sleep than you can be sure it's something installed on your profile. If it continues to happen it's possible that the operating system is having an issue and may need reinstalled or that there is some kind of crazy hardware issue causing this. It's a lengthy troubleshooting process but it's the only one I know for an issue like this - please update here and I can help out more with this if you do decide to go this route.\n\nA: I have the same issue and noticed it only does it at my home Wi-Fi. When I sleep somewhere else (with Wi-Fi connected before) it won't drain the battery overnight.\n\nA: I had the same problem for a while. A colleague gave me the hint to delete all configured connections in network preferences like WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, Phone USB Tethering, FireWire, Thunderbolt this, Thunderbolt that etc (everything)! and apply. \nOnly configure what you need right now. In my case it was only WiFi and Bluetooth.\nThis fixed my problem and my MacBook Pro with Touch Bar sleeps like a baby every time I close the lid without this issue now.\n\nA: Tried disabling the WiFi tonight before closing the lid and it worked well. The system did wake up a couple times but there was no significant battery drain.\nNow since that is not really a practical solution I wrote a script for Hammerspoon that disables WiFi automatically before the system goes to sleep. It also checks if the display is awake because otherwise it would wake up the WiFi chip every time the system wakes when the lid is closed.\n", "Q: Two entries for Google Chrome in Notifications preferences In System Preferences > Notifications, there are two entries for Google Chrome, and they have different settings.\n\n\nI can obviously change them both to what I want, but why is this happening and how can I get rid of the extra one?\n\nA: The new answer\nThe reason why you see two notification sections in System preferences is because one is for calendar (That is the one with the banner) and one regular notifications (the one that controls website notifications \n\nThe old answer\nThe reason why this answer is not right in your cause is because this is for Chrome's settings\nIf you have multiple accounts on your Google Chrome browser, you can change the notifications for both accounts. If you want to get rid of a Google Chrome notification panel, simply get rid of the account that you are not using anymore. The reason why they have different settings is that the primary account will show up different then your other accounts.     \n\nA: For Monterey release of macOS in 2021 (4 years later), trashing the Google Chrome app and downloading a new Chrome from here seems to fix this problem.\nNew Google Chrome has reclaimed the old 'Notification & Focus' entry (or at least deleted the old one and installed just ONE entry).\n\nA: From this Reddit thread on the same topic, the answer was intuitively obvious ...\n\nHave you tried deleting one or both entries (just select entry and hit Backspace key)?\nNotification to (re-)enable notifications :) should appear after next Chrome restart.\n\nBack to just the one entry now.\n", "Q: How to set up Time Machine backup for two macOS disks with third data disk? I'm hoping someone has had experience with this and can offer some advice, here's the lowdown on my scenario.\nI have a Mac Pro tower (so 4 drive bays) with all bays filled.\n\n\n*\n\n*Bay 1 has a 320GB HDD hosting Mavericks\n\n*Bay 2 has a 1.5TB HDD JHFS+ formattedd for a data/archive disk\n\n*Bay 3 has a 320GB HDD hosting Windows 7 \n\n*Bay 4 has a 120GB SSD that I just installed macOS Sierra on.\n\n\nI have a 2TB external HDD that I use for Time Machine backups, and in the past I backed up disks 1 and 2, leaving the Windows disk alone, of course. Now that I have an SSD running Sierra, my goal is to use Sierra as my primary OS, and only use Mavericks when necessary. (And it is necessary, occasionally.)\nUltimately my concern is this: I do not need Time Machine trying to back up three disks to my backup disk from one OS, only to have it attempt to do the whole thing over again when I boot into the other OS. Is Time Machine intelligent enough to know that I am backing up the same three disks from two OS's?\nUpdate: I ran Time Machine from the Sierra disk and it didn't try to duplicate the backup of the storage disk, so that's half of my question answered at least, but I'm still not sure I want to boot into Mavericks with the Time Machine disk connected until I know what to expect from it.\n\nA: Time Machine backups are organized by machine directory, then by snapshot (date&time), and only then by backup source (see the section on \"backup structure\" in the man page for tmutil). I might be wrong, but I would expect your Sierra and Mavericks installations to be considered separate \"machines\", even though they are running on the same physical machine. I'm not sure whether Time Machine is smart enough to realize that the backup sources for these two \"machines\" are the same, and to use hard links between them to avoid each machine directory to include completely separate copies.\nI think the simplest thing to do would be to set Time Machine on Sierra to backup all volumes except the SSD with Mavericks, while setting Time Machine on Mavericks to only backup the Mavericks volume. Or some variation on this of course, like backing up everything using Sierra and turning Time Machine on Mavericks off.\n", "Q: keyboard shortcut to rename the title of terminal?

I want to install a windows copy via bootcamp. I dont want to install windows on my internal HDD so i was thinking about buying a USB type c flash drive and install windows there. Is this possible and would there by any issues like transfer speeds ? \n\nA: As far as I am aware Boot Camp asks that you create a bootable USB flash drive to install Windows on your Mac.\nThough I don't have experience with a USB-C MacBook Pro, USB is USB, differing only in speed and the type of connector. MacOS should not care what kind of USB key you have.\nYou will have to download the Windows 10 ISO to your MacBook Pro so Boot Camp can use it to create the bootable media but other than that it should work fine.\n", "Q: Will apple reject app if there is trial version? Our team is working on an app where user will download and install app. He will initially have 5 days of trial period during which all of the features will be unlocked. After 5 days, some of the features will be locked and user will have to make in-app purchase (non-consumable, one time only) to unlock those features. After reading the App Store Review Guidelines, they state : \n\nDemos, betas, and trial versions of your app don’t belong on the App Store – use TestFlight instead. \n\nMy question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible that our app will get rejected? \n\n*Did you face any similar issue. Could you please give example.\n\n*What is the alternate? \n\n\nA: If you come out with “this is a trial” you will likely be rejected. If your app is “we do this and this” and if you want extra Y - try that, too and then decide to pay or go back to just “this and this”\nIf the app does something significant like Microsoft Word or Omni Graffle and then allows you to buy up to subscribe monthly / indefinitely or one time purchase an unlock to added functionality like editing a document, you should be totally in the clear - especially with one time / non consumable IAP entitlements. \nBasically, the app can’t be trial after the 5 days or whatever. The key for your design is that the reviewer can clearly see some functionality that will always work for free. If your app has no long term utility past the trial, you will need an alternate model or design in all likelihood.\n\nA: Don't Mention your app name and description as Trial, Demo, Test, etc., these kind of named apps will be rejected as per the apple rules.\n", "Q: Method of uploading contacts to a new iPhone? iPhone version: Up-to-Date (iOS - 10)\nI have more than 10,000 contacts in my phone.\nI recently tried to transfer them to a new [i]phone but with no luck...\nThe backup is sitting in my email as a .vcf file.\nMy method of uploading the contacts to the phone is:\nMail App-> \"Backup June 27\"->Download the File-> To contacts -> Crashes at this point.\nI don't have a save on iCloud.\nSo, I was wondering: what are all the ways (which might include Windows or Mac and so they are included) to upload a backup to an iPhone?\n\nA: Looking around, it appears there may be an app called Contacts Kit on the Mac app store. If I read correctly, this can be used to export the contacts to a file (which I know you have already done, however your file may be corrupted considering the process crashes) and then you do the steps in mail you did previously.\nOne thing I may suggest is that you open the App Switcher by double pressing the home button, and swiping upwards on every app but the mail app to close them off and free up memory. Considering your contacts list is in the hundreds of thousands you may simply be running out of memory, as I've had apps crash before when I ran out of memory. This can especially happen if the phone is older (thinking iPhone 5 as it can have as little as 512mb of RAM, yet still run iOS 10).\n", "Q: How does iMessage sync messages across devices? If iMessage uses end-to-end encryption, how do the messages get synchronized across Apple devices? \n\nA: It is the same mechanism where the messages get delivered in the first place. The server(s) maintain a database of registered devices and issue a message to the each device. \nOf note, each device receives a unique message - the encryption is one to one from the push servers to each device and not a broadcast of the same raw message to multiple devices. Once decrypted, the content is the same, but each instance of the “same message” has different keys and different payload data while encrypted. \n", "Q: Will connecting an Exchange account to my Mac enable remote wipe? I know that connecting an Exchange account to an iPhone can give the Exchange administrators the ability to force a Passcode change or remotely wipe the device, but is this possible on a Macbook/OS X/macOS client?\n\nA: The only supported devices for remote wipe are: Android, iOS, Windows. macOS is not supported.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-classic/deploy-use/use-remote-wipe-to-help-protect-data-using-microsoft-intune\ninTune features for macOS are listed here:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/intune-user-help/using-your-ios-or-macos-device-with-intune\n", "Q: Thunderbolt-ethernet cable heats up MacBook Air I recently bought a thunderbolt-ethernet cable because my university only provides internet access via ethernet, and I have a MacBook Air.

Also, does a USB-ethernet cable also do this?\n\nA: The USB-C gigabit adapters and thunderbolt adapters do run hot. I haven’t found any that do not. Older USB A ones run slower and cooler.

My default browser is Chrome (latest) but I also sometimes use Firefox and Safari.\nAs i understand in an ideal world Java would be disabled as it can pose a security risk, how can I disable it or only enable it on a case by case basis? \n\nA: Disabling the Java plugin can be done on a browser-by-browser basis:\nhttps://java.com/en/download/help/enable_browser.xml\nAs macOS 10.10.5 does NOT ship with java installed, an Oracle install must have been done, you can un-install it using their docs:\nhttps://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.xml\nsudo rm -fr /Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin \nsudo rm -fr /Library/PreferencePanes/JavaControlPanel.prefPane \nsudo rm -fr ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Java\n\n", "Q: Activate iCloud but keep calendar private My company invited me to join its iCloud calendar.\nOn my iPhone I didn't activate \"Calendar\" in the iCloud settings until now for data privacy reasons.\nWill my private calendar on my iPhone be synced to my personal iCloud as soon as I activate the \"Calendar\" switch in the iCloud settings? Or does my private local calendar stay local and I'd need to transfer my local calendar to iCloud manually if desired?\n\nA: iCloud will automatically sync all calendars not located on another server (such as a Google Calendar). It will take a few minutes to sync all the info to iCloud, then it will be available across all devices. Nothing stays local when iCloud is involved. It goes to the cloud, and syncs when it detects changes. \n\nA: You can have a seperate \"On My Mac\" calendar, which stays local. You can then have additional calendars for iCloud—only those calendars will be synced. You don't have to have iCloud activated for calendars to be invited either. Simply create a new \"On my Mac\" calendar, call it \"Work\" if you want, and add the event invitations to that.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/ph2682?locale=en_US\nUpdate:\nAs mentioned in my comment below. If you have an existing local calendar e.g. \"On My Mac\" or \"On My iPad\" and you sign into iCloud, you will be asked \"What would you like to do with your existing calendars\". Click Cancel to keep your existing local calendar.\nThe local calendar has to exist before signing into iCloud.

I have seen this question on here a few times, but never with a clear answer.\nI am using a iPhone 6s with iOS 10.3.3. When I take a picture I want it to be uploaded to my iCloud Photo Library; however I also want to be able to delete that photo from my iPhone while keeping it in iCloud (to free up space for other data).\nIs there a way to delete photos from my iPhone’s local storage but not from iCloud Photo Library?\n\nA: Apple’s solution is to manage your storage for you. Under Settings → Photos & Camera, select to Optimize iPhone Storage.\nAs long as you have enough local storage, photos will remain on your device. When your iPhone needs the space, high-resolution versions of your photos will be removed from your iPhone; all that is kept then is thumbnails, until you decide to view the photo again.\nAt that point a device-optimized version of the photo is downloaded from iCloud. A full-resolution version won’t be downloaded until you decide to edit or share the photo.\niCloud Photo Library is a photo-sync service, rather than a backup service, which is why deleting a photo anywhere deletes it everywhere. What you see on your device is what you see in iCloud is what you see on all your devices connected to the service.\n", "Q: Error -36 while copying .pkg from ftp server I obtain an error\n\nSome data can't be read or written (error code -36)\n\nwhile copying a .pkg file from an ftp server in Finder.

Also if you are comfortable in the command line you can do FTP there as well. \n", "Q: Microphone Not Working With FaceTime I'm at a loss on this one. My girlfriends microphone is not working in FaceTime on her iPhone 5s. The microphone itself works because we tested it with the Voice Memos app. When we have a FaceTime conversation I can occasionally hear some sort of clicking/crackling noise, but no voice. I don't know exactly what it's picking up. However with strictly FaceTime audio calls it does pick up sound. The sound also does not work with voice recording text messages. \nThe first thing I thought of was thinking that maybe the app doesn't have permission to access the microphone. I looked though settings and on FaceTime but couldn't find where the permission could be toggled. And I had no idea how to force it to ask the permission question again.\nPrior to getting her iPhone 5s screen fixed, she was using an old iPhone 4 for a long time. On the iPhone 4 FaceTime worked just fine. When she got the 5s back I restored it from iCloud with a backup image of the iPhone 4 so she would have all of her apps and what not. Since then the microphone on FaceTime has not been working.\nAny tips or ideas on what to try? \n\nA: I wonder if the iPhone is somehow detecting a pair of headphones in the device only when the FaceTime is active for video calls?\nSteps to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot iPhone\n\n*Try in phone app\n\n*Try again with FaceTime\n\n\nPossibly also try a device backup and then restore either using your computer or iCloud for the backup.\nEdit:\nWhen reading your comment, you reminded me that there are 2 separate mics on the iPhone 5S. Microphones on iPhones. I believe the mic on the back is used for FaceTime and the front mic is used for phone calls as well as FaceTime Audio.

A family member has been using an iPhone since around 2012 and regularly uses the Notes feature to store various things to remember. At some point, syncing of notes was no longer supported by Apple as they decided that everything should be on iCloud. Said family member does not want anything on the cloud.\nA few upgrades of the OS later and we're now in a situation that they have these multiple notes on the device, but are ONLY accessible on the device. Though I presume they're all getting backed up as part of the phone's backup process on iTunes, I'm imagining that they're stored in some binary format (PostgreSQL?) and not easily extracted if they decide one day to switch to Android. The only way out, it appears, is to COPY every note to either an email or to an iCloud note which neither is very appealing.\nIs there any way to do this? Preferably, it would be ideal if the notes would sync with their laptop's Notes application like it used to a few years ago, but I'm assuming that Apple won't change that back.\n\nA: This is a frustrating problem, and many folks are not happy with Apple's decisions regarding this direction of iCloud only syncing.\nWhile you can use Airdrop to copy individual notes from iPhone to the notes app on the Mac, that entails copying each note which you have already said is onerous (I would agree if there are many notes). The advantage this process has is that it's free, and it moves the notes into the Notes app on the Mac.\nSince this iPhone isn't synced anywhere in the cloud, there are several commercial apps that you can run that allow you to control your sync options with your iPhone. These have been made popular by Apple restricting what you can and cannot do between an iOS device and a computer.\nTwo that I have tested, and offer free trials, are SyncIOS and iMazing.\nBoth of these are generally well reviewed and easy to use. Both have limitations of their free trials and cost around $35 USD to unlock their full potential.\nBut even these programs don't actually support syncing of notes between Mac and iPhone. You can see and read the existing notes on the phone, but you have to export them to the desktop and then manually import them into Notes. Note here, SyncIOS allows you to actually create new notes from within the app on the iOS device!\nSo Notes, images, music and even voicemails are easily accessible, and you can back them up as well on your local desktop. Both apps come in Mac and PC versions and both require a USB connection to the iPhone or iPad.\nFor my money, iMazing is a more polished, feature rich app and it can easily access existing backups from iPhones or iPads. But either of these fine apps will meet the basic needs you mention in your post.\n", "Q: Eject Virtual Devices permanently I installed some programs (e.g. Sequel Pro), when I eject the virtual device from the Finder it seems ok but after some time it is re-added.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to remove them permanently? \n\n*What is the reason of this behaviour?\n\n\nEdit: \nMy machine is a MBP 15\" 2016 with macOS Sierra 10.12.6.\nThe problem does't give any error. Simply if I remove the devices they reappear after a while. The devices now are Sequel Pro 1.1.2 and fastnosql-1.5.1. I don't know if this is OS related or single programs related.\n\n\nA: There is a simple general explanation for why this happens: macOS will make shortcuts (aliases / sym links) to files that exist on a mounted disk Image or remote volume.\nWhen you open that shortcut, the images get re-mounted assuming there are no password is needed or the credentials are cached in an unlocked keychain.\nNow - you might need to do some work sleuthing why you are running files from those specific images, but the general idea is you can look around and worst case copy the DMG files to an external drive and delete them locally to see what things complain about a missing link / missing file when they run or open.\nThe most common case is you didn’t copy apps from the DMG to /Applications or a local folder and apps in the dock or elsewhere point at the DMG and not a local copy.\n", "Q: Move external iTunes library files to different location without losing metadata I'm trying to move my iTunes library to a new location. I'm running iTunes without the \"organize media\" option because I keep my library (60000+ songs) on a second drive in my MacBook... I recently upgraded to a new MacBook with a lot less storage but found out that you can run iTunes from a WebDAV cloud server without any noticeable lag (Yep!). I already have an exact copy of my second drive on the server but now I would like to know the simplest way to change the paths for all tracks in bulk? I've found some solutions myself but it would take literally weeks to complete:\n\n\n*\n\n*When playing a song that is not in its current position, iTunes will ask for the new location of this file and then will try to find other missing files in that same directory (so only that cd is imported). The importing itself is slow as well but that's probably due to the server.\n\n*Doug created a script that can change the location of selected files without losing metadata/rating but 500+ albums would take a too long :(\nI hope there is a simpler and faster way changing the paths since this is the last step holding me back from running my library from a cloud server.\nFor those interested, I can't store the library files on the cloud server as iTunes rewrite the library file (200mb) every time you change a rating so I keep my libraries in sync with a bitbucket server and source-tree.\nThanks!\n\nA: The locations are hard-coded, absolute not relative, so you need to find & replace\nfile:///Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/[yourname]/Music/iTunes/\nwith the actual path - file:///Volumes/mountpoint...\nThis would have been a single step find/replace on the iTunes Library.xml [which it is far better to keep in its original location even without the added complexity of a remote write] using something like TextWrangler/BBEdit if the library was consolidated to start with. As it isn't, you might have multiple steps to do, depending on how broad your \"path-scape\" is.\n.\nIt's been quite some time since I did this - the next step doesn't seem to work the same as it used to - see iTunes: Moving iTunes Files (Self Managed)\nBreaking the .itl no longer works with recent iTunes versions - it just complains it's damaged & makes a new one itself, which loses everything.\nI think last time I tried it I think I just left the .itl as it was & it ran OK (I'm open to correction on that if someone cares to try it, I'm not going to do it 'just to see' ;)\nRelated & possibly worth a read-through too, for general background & it also covers recent iTunes variations in method - How to share an iTunes library between Mac & Windows?\nBTW, I think you ought to still be able to use 'Organise Media' using a remote library - though mine is just on a different drive, not a different server, so I haven't tested that scenario.\n\nA: Ok after some days of googling I found a way to keep my original paths in my iTunes library but in some way link them to a different location using symlinks. Here is what I did to fix my problem:\nMy iTunes library was linked to all my files in /Volumes/Data/Music so when copying my library file to a different laptop without a \"Data\" drive iTunes will not find the files...\nI'm using mountain duck or cloudmounter to mount a 1TB WebDAV cloud server as a normal mac drive. this drive holds an exact copy of all the files in /Volumes/Data/Music. This drive is located under /Users/steven/Library/Containers/com.eltima.cloudmounter.mas/Data/.CMVolumes/Music/\nWhen creating a symlink you sort of trick mac to see /Volumes/Data/Music but when browsing to this location you will see the content of the mounted drive, this can be done by opening Terminal and run this command:\nsudo ln -s NEW_LOCATION LIBRARY_OLD_LOCATION\n\nso for me this would be \nsudo ln -s /Users/steven/Library/Containers/com.eltima.cloudmounter.mas/Data/.CMVolumes/Music/ /Volumes/Data/Music\n\nThe great part is that iTunes thinks all the files are just there and plays them as you would expect without changing anything to the library... so on my old laptop I can just keep the Data volume and play from there. As an extra automatically sync all folders from my old laptop to the webdav and server vice-versa so whenever I add songs on any of my laptops the file gets added to the other devices\nIf you want to remove this link you can do:\nunlink /Volumes/Data/Music\n\n", "Q: If I purchase an app on my iPad can I get it on a Microsoft PC Can I use an app I purchased on an iPad on a Windows PC?\n\nA: Generally, no.\nHowever the decision is ultimately up to the app’s developer to sell a single license across multiple platforms. So you’d have to check on a case-by-case basis (just don’t hold your breath).\nAs far as the actual executables, iOS and Windows apps run on completely different architectures, so there’s no way to copy an iPad app onto Windows and expect it to work.

This works in your first example because the document contains a single paragraph.\nThe correct combination for selecting to the end of the document is either ⇧ shift ⌘ cmd ↓ or ⇧ shift end, depending on that particular application’s shortcut for scrolling to the end of the document.\nCorrespondingly, selecting to the beginning of the document is ⇧ shift ⌘ cmd ↑ or ⇧ shift ↖︎ home.\nAnd finally selecting to the start of the line is ⇧ shift ⌘ cmd ←, and to the end of the line ⇧ shift ⌘ cmd →. Using ⌥ alt instead of ⌘ cmd selects the previous/next word, respectively.\n\nA: I found out what I was doing wrong.\nWhile working on the first document, I wrongly assumed that the shortcut to jump to the end of a document was SHIFT + ALT + ↓, because this shortcut selects the text till the end of the line, and the document was just one long line that wrapped.\nBut the actual shortcut to select till the end of the document and bypass linebreaks is SHIFT + CMD + ↓ - not ALT. \n", "Q: How do I open a generic URL from AppleScript?

There's a few types of Provisioning Profiles, most notably are the \"Development\" and \"Distribution\" profiles. I suggest looking at your provisioning profiles, and if necessary recreate them.\nYou have to use App Store (not Ad-hoc) provisioning Profile while creating your .ipa in order to upload to App Store with Application Loader. \nTry this, and see if that helps.

Previously, we all had our separate iCloud accounts for contact syncing, calendaring, reminders, etc. and shared a single account for out store purchases.\nNow that we've family sharing setup, besides still using separate iCloud accounts for the above purposes, everyone started using their own iCloud accounts for their store purchases as well.\nWhen I go to Settings > Apple ID > Family Sharing > Share Purchases, I see that the old account we used to share for our store purchases is listed as to be shared among family members but when I recently tried to download a past purchase with that account, I repurchased it(I was logged in to the store with my own iCloud account).\nWhat should I do if I want to be able to access my previous purchases?\n\nA: Finally got around this pesky problem. And actually it was pretty straightforward!\nAll I had to do was add that old shared account as a separate family member. Hence now everybody only uses their respective iCloud ID for their personal stuff and purchases while sharing their old/new purchases.\nThis might not be a solution for you since family sharing only accepts 6 family members at the most as of now although there isn't any other solution currently.\n", "Q: What is the best replacement battery for iPhone 5s My battery is 300+ cycles on my iPhone 5s, and it is draining very quickly, even though I do not have much applications running, and not many of them use background app refresh.

Can someone help me to create that smart playlist?\nHere is a screenshot of my first attempt but this creates a live updating clone, which is not very helpful.\n\n\nA: iTunes' Smart Playlist feature does not have any memory.

I have dialed and received calls and messages from only 1 phone number. I do not have an Apple ID or email or anything else setup on this phone. \nHow would I receive a text message from an unknown number, which would indicate that this person could read my texts?\n\nA: It appears you simply received spam. This, in itself, does not mean that this person has been reading your text messages. In fact they might have simply sent a generic message to random numbers, and one of them happened to be yours.\nSo unless that spam text referred to things you’ve said in private conversations, the spammer is NOT reading your texts. You are safe to delete the spam message by swiping left from your list of messages and tapping Delete.\nIf you want to go the extra mile, long-press that spam message. When the menu appears, tap More… followed by the arrow in the bottom-right corner of your screen. Forward that message verbatim to 7726, which is the number for reporting spam texts in the US. Verizon will then ask you for the number that sent you the spam. Respond with it and they’ll take care of it.\n", "Q: How to delete orphan images from Notes.app on Mac I have an image that shows in the “Browse attachments” view in the Notes app on Mac, but when I right-click on it and choose Show in Note, it doesn’t return any note, as it was deleted previously.\nIs there a way to remove this orphan image?

And it synced to the Mac as well.\n", "Q: Finder or Photos? Does storing photos in the Photos app or finder take up more space? Or are they the same? \nI'm trying to free up some storage, and I have a lot of photos, so just wondering whether moving all that into the Photos app will change anything. \n(By the way, I DON'T use iCloud so don't tell me to store it there)\n\nA: Importing your photos into Photos will take a little more space, simply due to the fact that Photos will generate thumbnails for your full-size photos, and store additional metadata, such as facial recognition data, etc.\nPhotos also allows you to make and save edits to your photos, which will take up additional storage on top of the space your photos occupy on their own.\nThe extra metadata occupies a negligible amount of additional storage, although edits might, depending on how many photos you’ve edited.\nSo yes, storing straight files on your hard drive will save you some space, but it’s also a totally barebones storage/browsing solution. How much space you save will depend on your use of the Photos app.\nOn the other hand, if you use Photos in such a way that storing your pictures there causes a vast difference in storage needs, then allegedly you’re also making good use of that extra storage.\n", "Q: Download and Install Photoshop CS5 I want to transfer a legal, licensed copy of Photoshop CS5 from and old Lion iMac I am de-commissioning to my current El Capitan system.  I have the license number, but not the install media as this copy of Photoshop started off as CS3 and then I did an online upgrade to CS5.  So I don't have CS5 install disks.\nSo I go to Download CS5 products and download the OS X install file for Photoshop CS5.  However when I went to run the installer I was presented with this:\n\nObviously something has gone wrong.  However I am not sure if this is an artifact related to not having Java 6 installed (See Will Adobe CS5 with Java SE runtime work on 10.11 El Capitan?) or if the file is actually hosed.  But Is it possible to use Adobe CS5 with Java SE 7? makes me think I should get past an install.\nI don't believe that I have Java installed (and I only saw that question when I was composing this one), but I also don't want to have to jump through hoops to get CS5 up and running again.\n\nUpdate - When I right click on the installer and select Show Package Contents I appear to be able to see the internals without any problem.\n\nA: As per the comment from user3439894 the issue was that I had \n\nSystem Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Allow apps\n  downloaded from:\n\nset to\n\nMac App Store and identified developers\n\nOnce I set it to be\n\nAnywhere\n\nThen I could run the installer.  \nThe error message I received was disingenuous and did not inform me of what the actual problem was.\n\nProtip - Even though Adobe wouldn't tell me what my CS5 license number was there are ways to extract it from OS X.

If I connect the upstream port with a USB-B to USB-C cable to a 13\" 2017 MBP will it charge the laptop? Another way to put this question is: can I use the 13\" 2017 MBP in closed-clamshell mode with the Dell U2715H connected through a DP to USB-C and a USB-B to USB-C cable?\n\nA: The monitor will not be able to charge the laptop, no. Therefore the MBP will not by default work in closed-camshell mode when connected only to the monitor and not to another external power source.\n", "Q: Where could be the ringtones, wallpapers located on iOS IPSW package? I've used and already extracted the IPSW of iOS 11, there are 4 DMG files there, where could that be on that DMG files there, and where exactly insider one of there could I find that such files?\n\nA: They're in the biggest of the three DMGs (the one containing the root file system, it's 2.3GB in my IPSW), under /Library/Wallpaper/iPhone:\n\nRingtones can be found in the same DMG, under /Library/Ringtones.\n", "Q: ios backbutton at top of the screen In many apps like safari or youtube the backbutton is at the top of the screen. That makes it basically impossible to use my ipad pro 9.7 comfortably in bed, I would have to sit up and use both hands to access the back button. Is there any way to get a back button at the bottom of the screen?\n\nA: I'm not aware of any way of doing this within iOS proper (although there may be a way to implement such a feature on a jailbroken device).\nHowever, you could just double tap the home button to then select the previous app from the screen. \nAlso, using your iPad in landscape (I.e. Sideways) may help with accessing the default 'back' button.\n\nA: You raise a valid point... with the larger screens of iPad Pros, a worthwhile option would be a system setting that could allow the back button to be relocated. \nUnfortunately at the current time, the back button is set at the top of the screen. \nThis location is controlled by the operating system and so it is outside the ability of a software developer to relocate elsewhere on the screen. \nRemember too that many apps allow a swipe action from the left edge of the screen to the right, that performs the same function as tapping the back button. \n", "Q: Sound produced by spacebar on MBP 15\" (mid-2017) non-symmetrical When rapidly pressing the left area of the keyboard (directly under C,V,B,N keys) of the QWERTY keyboard on the mid-2017 MacBook Pro 15\", the sound produced is different than pressing the right edge of the keyboard (under the M key). Simply put, the left side produces a louder sound which seems to occur higher up in the keyboard, where the right edge sounds like the normal alpha-numeric keys where the sound seems to originate further down. Is this an issue solely with my computer, or does it occur with every MBP?\n\nA: The keyboard on the 2016 and 2017 mbp is prone to getting sticky, soft and even unresponsive keys. Usually caused by dust or dirt under the key caps.\nTry cleaning the keyboard as mentioned in apple's support files: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205662\n", "Q: Laptop wont connect to internet after sleep but will connect to network Ive got a MBP (spec below in screenshot) running OSX 10.10.5 \nIve got an issue where every time i wake my MBP from sleep it will connect to the wifi network and my laptop will show up during a LAN scan, but will struggle to load pages it does eventually and intermittently load them, but takes for ever, even though I've got a 200mbps connection. \nThere are several things i can do to fix the problem, each one of them individually will fix the issue, but none are ideal : \n\n\n*\n\n*connect to the network through a wired connection \n\n*restart my MBP\n\n*restart the wifi access point \n\n*restart the network switch\n\n\nAny idea what might be causing the issue and how i can resolve it ?

I was able to track it once before its battery died. I set it in Lost Mode with a lock passcode. Ever since the device has always been offline.\nCan anyone reset the device as new and use without me knowing? Can it connect to wifi while in Lost Mode?\nThe device is still linked to my iCloud account and has not been erased because I am still hoping to retrieve it one day.\n\nA: A Wifi-only iPad will only connect to the Internet via known Wifi networks. If you had some public Wifi networks saved (either directly on the iPad, or through iCloud Keychain), then there’s a chance your iPad will connect to the Internet, if and when the person in possession of it comes within range of such a Wifi network.\nThe problem is many (most?) public Wifi networks use a “captive portal” (the confirmation page asking you to accept terms of use). The iPad can’t communicate with the Internet until after tapping through the captive portal. So there’s a great chance your iPad will never connect to the Internet. In addition, thieves often enable Airplane Mode or at least disable the cellular/Wifi radios, so it’s important to set Lost Mode as soon as the device is lost.\nAnd just so we’re clear, if you only put your iPad in Lost Mode AFTER its battery died and it hasn’t reconnected to the Internet since, then it is NOT in Lost Mode. You may have informed iCloud that your iPad is lost; however until iCloud can communicate with your iPad, it will NOT be in Lost Mode. It all depends on when you activated Lost Mode.\nHowever since you had Find my iPad turned on, Activation Lock will prevent any potential thief from activating it and associating your iPad with their Apple ID, even if they manage to wipe it.\nThe real danger is if they somehow crack your passcode. Then they can access whatever you had locally on your iPad, including photos, email, etc.\nSo I hope you had a passcode and that it was not easily guessable. Based on what you said however, that was not the case, so whoever has your iPad would also have access to all the data currently on the device.\n", "Q: How Do I Stop FileVault from Decrypting my MacBook Pro? Somehow I stupidly started to turn off my FileVault on my MacBook Pro.  Not exactly sure how I did this, brain fart.  Now my machine is trying to decrypt what I assume are all my files.  Right now I have the decryption paused, but it is waiting for me to hook up my power cable to complete the decryption.  I'm afraid when I run out of power and hook up my power cable to recharge my machine, the decryption will restart.  I want to stop this process and go back to the way my machine was before.  Is there some way for me to stop the decryption and restart the FileVault?\n\nA: Ideally, let it complete and then turn FileVault back on once it's done. Not elegant but should work.\n", "Q: I just got an \"Infection Blocked\" alert from Avast when I went to the Macworld site - 8:40 pm eastern timeAug 2nd From a macworld URL ending in . . . ads/prebid.min.js.  \nIs this something to be worried about? Should this be reported to someone?\n\nA: Prebid is a program on the server that serves the site, it is used to setup and manage header bidding advertising partners without writing code or confusing line items. For more on the project, see https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js — basically, if there are ads on the site, it’s trying to block them from being interactive. \n", "Q: iPhone 5s reset password—wrong date of birth I was having problems with my daughter’s iPhone 5s touch screen. I was advised to do a factory reset, as this could rectify the problem. After I did this I encountered Activation Lock.\nYou’ve guessed it, she can’t remember her Apple ID password. We tried to reset it, since she can’t remember her email password either, we can’t login to her email. We then opted for the security questions, but it’s rejecting her date of birth.\nWhat options do we have?\n\nA: Head on over to https://iforgot.apple.com/ and see if you can get your situation sorted out—although I’m not sure you’ll get any more options than what you already went through.\nIf that fails, you’ll need to contact Apple directly and be prepared to prove that the iPhone is indeed yours/your daughter’s.\n", "Q: I am not able to change my root password on Mac Ok so I need adb for a problem in my android phone. And for that I need my root password. So I tried to change it since I was not aware of it being a thing in the first place. I followed this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfX5I_mnnYc. But I am not able to change it successfully since it tells me that my password is wrong every time. I am not sure what I am doing wrong but some help would be appreciated.\n\nA: There is no root user on macOS. You can just use sudo and your admin account password for adb — no need to change any passwords. It’s also very non-typical to run apps as root, so you might need to check with the app maker if you’re considering trying that to verify you are installing the app properly in the first place or don’t have a different error to solve than permissions. \nYou could have a problem if your Mac account has no password, so set one in the users pane of system preferences. \nYou can install most command line tools without root, Android sdk tools, too: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2677431/where-to-install-android-sdk-on-mac-os-x\n", "Q: Change font in Console.app in macOS Sierra How do I change the font used in macOS Sierra?

I cannot find any menu item for fonts, nor can I find any toolbar button available for accessing fonts.\nThe context-menu for the content of a Console.app window offers a Font > Show Fonts item. The standard font-picker appears. But choosing fonts in the picker has no effect on the Console.app window.\n\nA: Unfortunately you can't change the font for Console.app OOTB with macOS 10.12.x.\nConsole.app uses the font that is located in the application itself ^.

Start by making one admin account with the same short name as your preferred main account on the old Mac. \nIt will make /Users/whatever on the boot drive. Then you can copy all of users from the migration donor Mac to the large new drive. Use rsync or something that can run several passes or resume a broken transfer if you can, or be patient with finder if you can’t. \nAt the end, you’ll use advanced settings in the user preference pane to point the home folder(s) for each account needed to the second drive home folder. \n", "Q: How to convert an HTML file with referenced images on the command line to a webarchive? Under macOS I want to convert HTML files with referenced images on the command line/programatically to webarchives.\nGiven a sample file sample.html containing:\n<html><body>\n<h1>File with resource</h1>\n<p>This file shows text and references an image.</p>\n<img src=\"sample.jpg\" />\n</body></html>\n\nand an image sample.jpg in the same directory, I can view the html file in any browser and it is render with the image. To convert to a webarchive I tried:\ntextutil -convert webarchive sample.html\n\nbut the resulting sample.webarchive does not, when opened in Safari, render the image - though it contains it (see comments).\nHow can I do the conversion from the command line correctly, so that the result contains and renders the image? After all that's what webarchives are for!\n\nA: Use the tool webarchiver (which you can install via brew install webarchiver):\nwebarchiver -url sample.html -output sample.webarchive\n\nThe webarchive produced contains the image and Safari shows the image when it displays the webarchive.\n\nA: I think the commandline is not aware of any image being included.\nI tested a simple webpage with image+text and opened it with Safari.\nIf you choose File -> Save as ..

To facilitate this, every time I plug my mouse in, I have to go to System Preferences and change the mouse settings (reverse scroll direction and adjust sensitivity). Is there any way by which I can automate this change (maybe using automator) in settings to occur automatically every time I plug in the USB mouse?\n\nA: Under macOS Sierra, if you have only a normal USB mouse, not one that comes with it's own software and is multi-function with additional buttons, etc., then in System Preferences > Mouse, you have the following settings that can be changed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scroll direction: natural checkbox\n\n*Tracking speed slider\n\n*Scrolling Speed slider\n\n*Double-Click speed slider\nAnd two additional settings under Mouse that will not be addressed, for two reasons, the Primary mouse button: radio buttons, if other then the default of Left, is in all likelihood already set and wouldn't necessarily change because one wants to change the Scroll direction: natural checkbox, and since the OP stated USB mouse, I'll assume is not using Bluetooth and can ignore the Setup Bluetooth Mouse... button.\nThis answer is going to use AppleScript to get the before and after settings for the value of the aforementioned listed sliders to be used in the AppleScript code that follows after this code.\nOpen Script Editor and create a new document, then add the following code:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.mouse\"\n    --delay 0.5 -- # If necessary, uncomment 'delay' command and set its value in seconds and or decimal fractions there of.\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        log \"Scrolling speed is set to: \" & value in (get properties of slider 1 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\")\n        log \"Double-Click speed is set to: \" & value in (get properties of slider 2 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\")\n        log \"Tracking speed is set to: \" & value in (get properties of slider 3 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\")\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThere will be two difference states of the Scroll direction: natural checkbox in System Preferences > Mouse, checked and unchecked and the change in slider settings between the two states.\nThe code above will be run once to get the current value settings of the sliders. Then make the setting changes that you want to the sliders for the opposite state of what it was when you gathered the values of the first settings for the first state. Then run the code again to get the differential settings.\nYou will then plug in the values, gathered above, in the code below. You can comment out or remove any slider that's not going to be changed by the code below.\nThe comments in the code below should be adequate, however, don't hesitate to ask it you need anything explained.\nI saved the following AppleScript code in Script Editor as an application named Toggle Mouse Settings in the Applications folder.\nWhen run, it toggles the state of the Scroll direction: natural checkbox between checked and unchecked along with the slider settings under each state.\nAppleScript code for the Toggle Mouse Settings app:\non run\n    try\n        tell application \"System Preferences\"\n            set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.mouse\"\n            -- delay 0.5    -- # If necessary, uncomment 'delay' command and set its value in seconds and or decimal fractions there of.\n            tell application \"System Events\"\n                set isChecked to get value of checkbox 1 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\" as boolean\n                if isChecked then\n                    --  # The 'Scroll direction: Natural' checkbox is checked, uncheck it.\n                    set cbValue to value of (click checkbox 1 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\") as boolean\n                    --  # Scrolling Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 8.0\n                    set value of slider 1 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\" to 6.0\n                    --  # Double-Click Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 10.0\n                    set value of slider 2 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\" to 8.0\n                    --  # Tracking Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 9.0\n                    set value of slider 3 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\" to 6.0\n                else\n                    --  # The 'Scroll direction: Natural' checkbox is not checked, check it.\n                    set cbValue to value of (click checkbox 1 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\") as boolean\n                    --  # Scrolling Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 8.0\n                    set value of slider 1 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\" to 4.5\n                    --  # Double-Click Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 10.0\n                    set value of slider 2 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\" to 8.0\n                    --  # Tracking Speed - Valid Values: 0.0 to 9.0\n                    set value of slider 3 of front window of application process \"System Preferences\" to 4.0\n                end if\n            end tell\n            tell me\n                if cbValue then\n                    display notification \"Natural scrolling is now active.\" with title (name of me)\n                else\n                    display notification \"Natural scrolling is no longer active.\" with title (name of me)\n                end if\n            end tell\n            quit\n        end tell\n    on error eStr number eNum\n        activate\n        display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"Toggle Mouse Settings\" with icon caution\n        tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n        return\n    end try\nend run\n\nNote: Before running the Toggle Mouse Settings app, you'll need to add it to: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\n\nThere is an app called EventScripts that could be used to trigger when a USB device is plugged in and or removed.

I have another project to run IT tests which sets up the API and performs lots of testing.\nTests take ~6 minutes on Linux and Windows (and when this is first thing i do after restarting my mac).\nWhen i run them on my mac they take very long time (~30 mins and go on)\nI notice in Activity Monitor that CPU is 90% idle after the API has started and tests begin to execute. Java processes uses ~0.5% of CPU. There is still ~7 GB memory free.\nRunning this on other environments (e.g. Linux) usually takes most of available resources (almost 100% CPU usage and memory)\nCan somebody help me resolve this issue?

Is there a way I can download music and sync it to my phone, then delete the files from iTunes afterwards?\n\nA: This may be possible by configuring iTunes to Manually manage music and videos. Then iTunes shouldn’t require you to have the same songs on your iPhone as you do on your computer.\nAnother way is to enable iCloud Music Library. This is a paid service that becomes available if you use either iTunes Match ($24.99/year) or MUSIC ($9.99/month).\nBy now you should have been bombarded with prompts for MUSIC. To subscribe to iTunes Match, open iTunes and open Music → Store, then click iTunes Match on the right hand side:\n\nYour iPhone will then sync music with iCloud rather than with iTunes on your computer, and you will no longer need to keep any music on your computer. In fact this makes your entire music library available for streaming so you don’t even need to keep it on your iPhone either.\n", "Q: Some audio (but not all) coming out of MacBook speakers instead of Display speakers My 13\" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is connected to my Apple Thunderbolt Display via a genuine Apple Thunderbolt to USB-C adapter. The audio from the MacBook is piped through to the built-in speakers in the Apple display. \nMusic, movies, YouTube videos… all that audio comes out of the display's speakers. What's weird is that certain system sounds come out of the MacBooks speakers… like Messages notifications and the screenshot camera click sound. What's more, is that I can't seem to adjust the volume of the sounds coming from the MacBook's speakers. Adjusting the volume on the MacBook's Touch Bar and on my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard only affect the Apple Display volume, not the MacBook.\nThis is a problem, of course, and quite annoying. I've done all of the typical troubleshooting things: restarted, unplugged and replugged, set, unset, and reset the output destination in the Sound preference pane.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Follow these steps to solve this issue on a Mac running macOS 10.12:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Go to Sound\n\n*Click 'Sound Effects'\n\n*Set Play sound effects through: to Selected sound output device\n\n*Optionally: Select 'Output' and set your desired sound output device (e.g. your external display).\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n", "Q: AppleScript: Activate all mail rules with \"sort: \" in their name I would like an AppleScript to activate all rules that have the string \"sort: \" in their names.\nAs far as I know this is how to enable a mail rule:\ntell application \"Mail\" to set enabled of rule \"sort: foo bar\" to true\n\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I get the names of all mail rules?\n\n*How do I filter these names for containing the string \"sort: \"?\n\n\nA: Pretty simple one-liner:\ntell application \"Mail\" to set enabled of rules whose name starts with \"sort: \" to true\nYou don’t even need to get all those rules or their names; however if you want to do so it’s just as straightforward:\ntell application \"Mail\" to get name of rules whose name starts with \"sort: \"\nNote: your example starts with sort: but you asked about strings containing that string.

The dock has thunderbolt, HDMI, and VGA on the back. A single USB-C cable comes off of the dock.\n\nThe issue I have noticed is that if all three of my monitors are plugged into the dock, the Mac only recognizes them as a single monitor so its just 3 monitors mirroring my MacBook.\nCurrently, I had to solve this by using a dongle for two of the monitors, leaving only one hooked up to the dock.\nThis is not that ideal, for cable management and the fact that USB-C is supposed to be able to handle multiple monitors.\nAre there any driver updates or hacks I can apply in order to get these monitors to be independent and not show up as a single monitor? Is this an Apple limitation in place or something else?\nEdit: Use this link to install the drivers and the DELL Dock will start working Drivers\n\nA: This is a hardware limitation. \nI tested Dell WD 15 with my 2016 Macbook Pro 15. I used VGA and HDMI to connect my 2 monitors with Dell WD15 but Mac recognized both monitors as one. \nLater, I connected one monitor with Dell WD15 and another monitor directly with my mac through USB-C to VGA and it worked fine.\n\nA: Allright, just confirmed that this product is not fully compatible with a MacBook.\nThe dock doesn't communicate powerinfo with the Macbook so doesn't supply it with enough power. (Charging takes more than 10 hours.)\nOther peripherals do work.\nUSB: Works\nEthernet: Works\nDisplay: VGA/Displayport/HDMI Works\n\n\n\nA: First off the dock actually does not have Thunderbolt as you write - it is instead a mini-DisplayPort connector. Dell has a much similar product called TB15 which has Thunderbolt support. The WD15 does not. Note that TB15 was discontinued/recalled because of stability issues, and a newer product named TB16 is now available.\nDell does not support macOS for this product, so they do not express any guarantee that it is supposed to work with your MBP running macOS.\nDell writes on their support page (linked below) that the dock does not support 3 monitors in \"extended mode\" (i.e. each monitor is independent). With a 3rd display connected via VGA that display will always be in \"clone mode\" (i.e. just a mirror of another monitor).\nhttp://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/sln296829/how-to-use-and-troubleshoot-the-dell-dock-wd15?lang=en\nThis seems to be a hardware limitation, and thus no driver changes or software hacks will ever allow you to run 3 independent displays.\nIn addition to this, your MacBook Pro does not support MST (multi-stream transport) via the USB-C cable you plug in. MST is required for this dock's \"extended mode\" to work even with just two monitors.\nI would recommend buying a dock that specifically supports your Mac. For example the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock HD, although it will still only allow connecting 2 ordinary (i.e. non USB DisplayLink) monitors to the dock.\n\nA: For my 2017 MacbookPro 15\" using Dell WD15 as a docking solution, external display with a Dell P2416D is working out of the box through mini-displayport. Gigabit Ethernet requires me to download a driver from Realtek here. Download the version for MacOS as shown below. Power charging is slow (approx. 1hr to go from 80% to 100%), but at least not draining power.\n\n\nA: While searching for a solution to this very same issue and testing things out I discovered that while running Windows 10 via Bootcamp, the single USB C cable will support 2 external monitors (each as extended desktops), Power, & USB peripherals (Keyboard, Mouse, external HDD). Charging does seem a little slow but not terrible (approx. 20min to go from 80% to 100%). So seems more like a software issue then a hardware issue. \n", "Q: Rearrange single pictures in Photos? How do you manually rearrange single pictures in Apple \"Photos\"? In iPhoto it was possible to select the picture, hold down the mouse button and move to another position in the album. Has that feature been deleted?\n\nA: The default views (Moments, Collections, Years), as well as all automatic albums (All Photos, Selfies, Videos…) are always sorted with the most recent at the bottom. This ordering cannot be changed.\nHowever you can create Albums, throw your pictures in there, then rearrange them to your heart’s content.\nTo view your albums, press ⌘ cmd 4. You can also show the sidebar by pressing ⌘ cmd ⌥ opt s (it will be shown by default in macOS 10.13 High Sierra). Either option will give you access to your albums. Once you open an album, simply drag-and-drop it wherever you like with the mouse.\nThis will not affect the default views and automatic albums.\n", "Q: How to reset an iPhone safely Apologies for the noob question but I'm looking around and finding different answers (including data not getting restored). So I would like to make sure I'm following the right process.\nMy girlfriend's iPhone is acting slow and freezing from time to time. \nTherefore, I would like to restore it to its initial state and start all over. \nMore info: \n\n\n*\n\n*Her iCloud is full and not backing up anymore\n\n*She forgot her Apple ID password \n\n*Contacts, SMS, photos shall be restored after the reset\n\n*WhatsApp data also should be restored (I think this should be done from within the app)\n\n\nIdeally, I would like to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Back up all data through iTunes on PC\n\n*Perform a factory reset\n\n*Create a new Apple ID \n\n*Restore photos, contacts, SMS\n\n*Fresh install WhatsApp and restore corresponding data \n\n\nWould this work as expected? \n\nA: Your first step should be to head to https://iforgot.apple.com and change your Apple ID password. Since one of the methods of retrieval will be to have a link emailed to you, do this before wiping your iPhone. If you have Activation Lock enabled, you will need to provide this password anyway after wiping.\nDon’t create a new Apple ID unless you specifically want a new one.\nWhen you backup to iTunes, make sure your backup is encrypted:\n\nThis will allow your account passwords, Health, and HomeKit data to be backed up, and will encrypt your local backup with a password. Do not lose this password!\niTunes should immediately start backing up your iPhone. After that you should be safe to Erase All Contents and Settings on your iPhone, then restore your local backup via iTunes.\nDo note that it is not possible (or very difficult) to selectively restore apps, settings, etc. A restore restores all your apps and settings as they were at the time of the backup. However if there was any system corruption, etc. a wipe & restore should take care of such problems.\n", "Q: Possible to connect multiple Macs via Thunderbolt Networking (IP over Thunderbolt)? Looking to connect 4 Macs to a central Mac Mini that is running as a server (with a few Thunderbolt RAID arrays connected it as data sources). \nNetwork is currently gigabit ethernet, but would like to speed up data transfers.  10G Thunderbolt Ethernet Adapters are still relatively expensive ($300-500) - so I'm wondering if its possible to connect multiple Macs via IP over Thunderbolt?  \nApple supports a direct connection between two computers via IP, but is it possible to connect multiple either via daisy chaining them or via some sort of a Thunderbolt hub or switch (if one exists)?\nIf so, this would make for a relatively inexpensive way to build a 10G LAN network with (mostly) existing hardware and a few Optical Thunderbolt Cables\n\nA: Theoretically, yes you can do this. You would need a Mac with multiple Thunderbolt ports like a 2013 MacPro with its 6 Thunderbolt ports. Not sure if daisy chaining multiple Macs together will give you the desired effect.\nThis link seems to think that it will work but says nothing about daisy chaining only plugging a bunch of Macs into one Mac with a lot of ports.\nSo it seems that it is safe to plug a bunch of Macs together VIA thunderbolt which opens the door to you experimenting with various topologies to find one that does what you want.\n", "Q: How can I delete the \"Recents\" pictures when selecting a profile photo?

My account is the master for family sharing. I’m missing important photos and want to find them of possible. \nMy son has turned off family sharing on his ipad air 1 approx few months ago. I only discovered yesterday that the photos were gone but my son says he did turn off a couple of months ago. There are no photos on my sons ipad  now - He says he deleted them.\nThe photos in question were taken with my iphone but they have vanished and I was updating to the icloud but they dont appear to be in there either. \nBasically all of my photos have disappeared from my iphone 4 and the icloud. Is there anyway to get these back?\n\nA: I'll provide the best answer I can for now, as time may be of the essence here, but I would suggest that you provide your iPadOS version here also in case there are any differences between how it currently works and any older version you may be running. That being said:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Photos app.\n\n*Tap \"Albums\".\n\n*Tap \"Recently Deleted\".\n\n*Tap \"Select\".\n\n*Tap \"Recover All\".\n\n*Tap \"Recover [number] Items\" to confirm.\n\nAnything that was deleted within the last month should still be in there. If it's been longer than a month, you may be out of luck, unfortunately, but I would still encourage you to reach out to Apple Support in case there's anything at all they can do to help you, as it sounds like these are very important photos to you. If Apple Support also cannot help, there is software such as Disk Drill or other utilities you can try for recovering this data. Often these utilities come with a free trial period so you may not have to pay anything if you decide not to keep the software.

The openCL score on Geekbench goes to 13k from 40k and FPS dips in all games. It seems that it is not using it's full potential since the fans do not really ramp up. Only a restart fixes the problem temporarily for a few hours before it goes back down even if I close all other applications. The intel GPU is unaffected. \nCan anyone identify what I can try? No one has reported that it's the bug in the beta. What can I do to solve this issue? I've reset the NVRAM and SMC already, which didn't work.\n\nA: Our work lab Mac typically run very well for a week to a month between reboots. On high Sierra, since the initial build - we are seeing stability degrade from hours to days instead of weeks. \nIf you can report your details - tests, scripts, sample files or apps - to Apple, you'll likely get some sort of explanation or learn when it’s fixed. In fairness, this isn’t unusual for beta and for new system chipsets and both of these are in play. Also, most of our apps are absolutely not ready yet and the filesystem is also still being tuned, tweaked and functions rolled out. \n", "Q: Unicode fonts not stacking correctly (especially Kokonor) Correctly formatted Tibetan text, when pasted into Word, especially using the Kokonor font, does not stack correctly.

The measured time difference was about -50 milliseconds. (That's obviously no leap second or time zone issue.)\nWe understand that iOS devices synchronize their time with NTP servers while being online. But the negative time difference was observed while having no network connection at all.\nAre there any reasons iOS would update the system time while offline?\nRelevant posts:\n\n\n*\n\n*We'll certainly need to follow this approach for measuring elapsed times. But nevertheless, we'd like to understand what was causing the jump.\n\n*This answer mentions reasons for such time jumps, but none of them seems to apply in my case.\n\n*This answer mentions significant time changes. But what are insignificant changes?\nUpdate: After 2 hours in airplane mode we observed a time jump of 637 ms into the past with System.DateTime.Now on a iPad Mini 2, while CACurrentMediaTime kept increasing monotonically. It's still unclear why iOS should do such a significant jump after such a long time without NTP updates.\n\nA: The RTC clock is \"tweaked\" periodically to correct its time (for example to account for clock drift) - this happens no matter if you're online or offline. This is standard on modern operating systems, not just iOS.\nThe bug is not in your operating system, but in your app. If you want a monotonically increasing clock, you should not be using System.DateTime.Now. \nIn order to select the correct timer/clock function for your app, you need to determine what you want to use the time for - and then select accordingly. I.e. it is a very different need to want the current time to display to the user in a \"clock app\" compared to needing time to run a timer that will fire every 50 ms periodically in a game.\n", "Q: How can I download legacy software for an iPad 1?

I set up Windows to reverse the scroll direction of my mouse. This works when I'm running Windows in Boot Camp. But when I'm in VMWare, the scroll direction is reversed twice — once by Windows and once by macOS — which puts it back to regular scrolling.\nHow can I set this up to have natural scrolling in Windows in both Boot Camp and VMWare?\n\nA: Fortunately the HID device ids used when running bootcamp natively and running it under a VM (at least under the Parallels VM I use) are different. Here is what I did on Windows 10\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot natively.\n\n*Identify the device ID's in use from the Mouse Control Panel    \n\n\n*\n\n*Start->Settings. Click on Devices. Click on Mouse. Click \"Additional mouse options\"\n\n*Click on the Hardware tab. You should see \"HID compliant mouse\" You may see more than one if you also have, e.g, a Magic Trackpad. Only the devices in use will appear here. In this case this means only those used when running natively.\n\n*Select each device and click the Properties button.\n\n*In the properties windows,, click the Events tab. The device ID is given in the Information box at the bottom.\n\n\n*Find each device in regedit (run it as Administrator). They are at\n\nHKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\HID\\*\\*\\Device` Parameters\n\nreplacing the *'s with the ID you get from the mouse control panel.\n\n*Change the values of the FlipFlopWheel and FlipFlopHScroll properties to 1.\nThe command you used from https://superuser.com/a/364353 changes all HID devices in the registry having a FlipFlopWheel property. Unfortunately I haven't figured out any automated way to identify just those currently in use hence the manual method above.\nIf you've already run the script and set all devices to flip-flop, boot in the VM, follow the steps above to identify the \"mouse\" devices in use and change their FlipFlopWheel and FlipFlopHScroll properties back to 0.\n\nA: In system preferences, mouse, there is a check box to set the scrolling direction. This sets it for all apps though. I don't know of a way to set it for specific apps.\n\nA: Same question as this: Inverting direction of mouse scroll wheel\nAnswer is clear in the responses of that link and please have a try. It works for me:\nGet-ItemProperty HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\HID\\*\\*\\Device` Parameters FlipFlopWheel -EA 0 | ForEach-Object { Set-ItemProperty $_.PSPath FlipFlopWheel 1 }\n\n\nA: Try Scroll Reverser. While it's not automatic, it allows you to reverse your scrolling direction from the menu bar icon easily. Unfortunately the app doesn't support activating/deactivating it using a keyboard shortcut, but you can likely use AppleScript to set a keyboard shortcut for it.\n", "Q: Cydia WiFi Hotspot for SSH Without SIM Card I have recently jailbroken an old iPhone 4 I have and have been having a great experience with it as a device to fiddle with, however I need to be able to use it in areas where there isn't any WiFi over SSH.\nIs there any tweak installable which will allow me to toggle the phone to make a WiFi Hotspot. The phone will not have a SIM Card installed to I don't care about mobile data. I simply want to connect to the phone's WiFi hotspot and SSH into its console via my iPad.\nThanks for any responses.\n\nA: I don't know of a package that will let you SSH from a hotspot coming from the phone, but I think you would have an easier time starting a hotspot on your iPad connecting the phone to the hotspot & SSHing from there.\n\nA: A tweak named Polus allows changing Control Center toggle switches and has a switch for hotspot. Though you might be on a too low iOS version and not have a CC. In that case try SBSettings(iOS 6 and lower), but you will have to search and install desired toggles manually. \n\nA: I found a simple solution which DOES involve a SIM card to this issue, but without the recurring fee of a SIM card. I purchased an EE SIM card for 99p at a local shop and stuffed it into the phone. On that SIM card I did get some free texts, minutes and data, but I used all the data up quickly and the minutes and texts had their free period expire. Now, this SIM was a pay-as-you-go SIM, and was not linked in any way to any of my payment details, meaning I can use it in data mode without any further cost. Simply, I turned on Mobile Data even though I had no data left and had not topped the card up with enough money to buy a data pack, and this allowed me to turn on Personal Hotspot. If I connect to this phone with another iDevice, I get captive.apple.com sign-in pop up, which can be disabled by tapping cancel, pressing the blue i next to the hostspot network under WiFi and switching off Auto-Login. Connecting again will make the hotspot stay connected and any attempt to connect to the internet from a tethered iDevice will result in being redirected to the Buy More Data popup.\nConnecting via USB to a Windows PC also resulted in this popup, but simply closing it fixed it.\nI can now find the IP address of the currently tethered device, for example 172.11.34.4 and work out that the hotspot's IP address is 172.11.34.1 which, connecting in an SSH app brings me to the OpenSSH command prompt! Hurray!\nThis was with an EE SIM, and if you are in America or elsewhere I believe EE isn't an option for you, but just because it worked with an EE SIM doesn't mean it won't also work with another kind of pay-as-you-go pick up at the store SIM.\n", "Q: How can I delete duplicate rows in Microsoft Excel 2011? Every 2nd Thursday our team has to produce reports from data provided to us in a Excel spreadsheet. Typically this data has about 23,000 rows of data. The problem is that since June these spreadsheets now have duplicated rows, due to a problem in the data warehouse they’re produced in. \nI don’t understand anything about that side of thing, but what I do know is that we need to find an easy way to delete every second row. At present we are splitting the data into 3 spreadsheets and I have 3 staff members deleting every 2nd row in their respective spreadsheet. When they’re all finished we merge them back into one spreadsheet to produce our reports. This is a big time waster (it still takes hours to do), creates a lot of stress due to other work getting delayed, and ruins morale in the team.\nWe’re using Excel 2011 on iMacs running El Capitan, so I was thinking that a macro could do this, right? Can someone confirm if this is the case and if yes how we would go about it? \n\nA: This answer assumes:\n\n\n*\n\n*you have a header row and, because of that, the first row containing your data is Row 2.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Excel spreadsheet in its original state (i.e. All duplicate rows are adjacent to each other)\n\n*Go to Tools > Macro > Visual Basic Editor\n\n*This will bring up a Project window with the name of your first sheet highlighted - Double-click on the sheet name\n\n*In the code window that appears, enter the code below (you should be able to just copy & paste it)\nSub DeleteEverySecondRow()\n    For i = Cells(Rows.Count, \"a\").End(xlUp).Row To 2 Step -2\n        Rows(i).Delete\n    Next i\nEnd Sub\n\n\n*Close the window and return back to your spreadsheet\n\n*Now go to Tools > Macro > Macros…\n\n*In the Macro window that appears, select the DeleteEverySecondRow macro and click on the Run button\n\n*Now wait a while for the macro to finish (how long it takes depends on how many rows you have - but it should take no more than a few minutes at most)\n\n*After it’s finished every second row will be deleted\n\n\nAny problems, please let me know.\nNOTE\nI've answered this question on the basis of the original title and the requirement you've specified (i.e. to delete every second row). However, keep in mind that if you've sorted the data in such a way that you're duplicate rows are no longer adjacent to each other, then this macro will not achieve what you actually need.\n", "Q: Why XAMPP listens on wrong IP address?

Then it wouldn't boot at all. It would just go black midways through the boot progress bar. \nAfter 10 attempts of hard shutdown and reboot it went into the login screen. I logged in successfully but started giving all sorts of strange error messages, as if the hard drive was read only, and went extremely slow. It took a really long time to even launch a Finder window, a Terminal or the Activity Monitor. The hard drive is SSD by the way.\nI managed to restart, then got the login screen again but wouldn't accept my password! From that point and on, whenever I try to boot, I usually reach the login screen but my account has disappeared! Only the \"guest\" account is present, which I haven't enabled as far as I know. So I can't login, but even typing into the password prompt has huge lags, it's going really slow. Sometimes I get the initial crash screen too (that's how I managed to take the picture attached).\nI tried booting with the D option to perform the hardware test. I performed an extended hardware test but no problems were reported.\nI also booted with the Alt option to run the Disk Utility to check the hard drive. It didn't report any problems.\nAny idea what could be wrong?\n\nA: It is hard to tell in cases like this as the hardware test and Disk Utility don't always find hardware or disk errors.\nHowever that the system can boot and run diagnostics bodes well for the hardware in the system. It sounds like it is possibly a damaged macOS install. I would be inclined to reinstall macOS right over top of what you already have there. Normally an OS install will not wipe any of your data. But, as always, verify you have a good working backup before proceeding.\nIf it still acts wonky after an OS reinstall I would say that you possibly have an issue with the HD/SSD and a 3rd party disk utility might be able to either tell you what is wrong and/or fix it. Failing that a visit to the Genius Bar may be in order.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro, High Sierra downloaded 13G last night while asleep The system was presumably closed at my workplace.\nHow can I find why ?

If you had a file here named MyFile.rtf that you never, ever wanted to see again, you could run this command:\nrm MyFile.rtf\n\nWhen you press Return, the file will go poof! It will be gone, toast, history. You can’t get it back.\n\nA: From the manual page:\n\nrm removes each specified file.\n\nThis means you can use it to remove a list of files at once, e.g. with\nrm -rf test1.txt test2.txt\n\nFortunately, all you did was pass an empty list of files, so it deleted nothing. Also, what @SolarMike says: if you don't know what a command does, don't run it. macOS is designed to 'hide' all dangerous (but potentially powerful) Unix operations from the end user.\n\nA: For the layman/Linux/Unix newbie: \nrm alone doesn't do anything because you haven't told it what to get rid of.\nman rm can explain most of this, if you understand it.\n-r means recursive, as in \"include everything in subfolders\"\n-f means force, \"don't ask me to confirm\" mode\nrm -rf(DON'T DO THIS)/ would say delete everything under / (the root folder) without checking (on recent macOS versions SIP will prevent you from removing macOS itself by this, but a lot of other stuff will get deleted)\nrm [some file name] would just delete that file.\nrm -rf /home/myuser/books would delete everything in myuser's books folder, as well as the folder.\n", "Q: Which temperature element is causing MacBook to stop? I have a MacBook 12 Early 2016.\nWhen I'm using it outside and it is hot, it warns me about stopping because the temperature is too high. And then it stops.\nI'm using a tool to see the temperature of different elements of the MacBook but I would like to know what is the element that makes this warning : I don't think it is the CPU because sometimes it is hotter without any warning. \nIs it the battery temperature or cpu proximity ? is there an official explanation ?\nThanks\n\nA: No. Apple doesn’t publish firmware code and you’d have to reverse engineer several components including the on die cpu sensors, the discrete sensors, probably sensors on storage and possibly dozens of sensors within the battery cells. \nSince the MacBook have no blowers, on a practical level, you can prop it up on a stand and ensure airflow is good and optionally ensure cool air surrounds the device to reduce internal temperatures. The whole case is a heat sink and radiator, so you can dramatically cool it with an elevated stand and/or cool airflow. \nIf you have any coverings or cases on your Mac - absolutely remove them since a thin gap of air between the metal and plastic is a great insulator just like a blanket would be.\nOutside in the sun or even with shade, you can have several additional problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*sunlight on the black screen will overheat it dramatically and light on the rest of the case is less than ideal. \n\n*getting cool air will be hard or impossible\n\n", "Q: Can’t get my volume button to work at all Recently my MacBook Air stopped allowing me to adjust the volume. Whether I press F12 or F11 it shows a forbidden symbol on it, as in the picture below.\n\nAfter some research I discovered there is a mute button in System Preferences, and you are supposed to make sure that it isn’t muted. However I don’t have the option to unmute it.\n\nAnyone know what to do in this case?

My 60w charger stopped working yesterday (no green light, no AC charger detected in system information). However, when I tested the charger with another MacBook Pro 13'' everything looked ok. \nThen I connected my MacBook Pro 13'' to a 85w charger from a 15'' and that one worked perfectly.\nWhat could be the reason? \n\nA: Either:\n\n\n*\n\n*The two Macbook 13 draw different power due to normal conditions and your adapter won't work at all when a normal but high draw is needed. (i.e. replace your adapter)\n\n*The 60 W adapter is failing and it' bad luck that you got a few heads in a row and a few tails in a row - if you do enough tests 50% failure rate will happen with any MacBook. (i.e. replace your adapter)\n\n*Your MacBook is drawing / requesting more power than it should and needs a soft reset / SMC reset or repair.

When this question was asked in 2012, specifically mentioning the \"command line\" requirement, an answer suggested Temperature Monitor (a \"legacy\" product). Running all three, Temperature Monitor along with smcFanControl and iStat Menu, side-by-side shows the problem. I don't want this level of perpetual distraction.\n\nI suspect the following answer: It is not possible to see the CPU&GPU temperatures from the command line. I suspect this because both iStat and Temperature Monitor install additional drivers. If that's the case, it would be nice to record that answer.\nsmcFanControl and iStat Menu are nice utilities to make you keep an eye on the temperature of your CPU. The former shows only the CPU temperature, and both are too distracting (the latter's precursor, iStat Nano, could sit silently in the Dashboard until one needed it, plus iStat Menu seems rather sticky: I haven't figured out how to delete it yet—just removing the program from /Applications is insufficient.)\nIt was nice to find that ioreg\nwill reveal the Maximum Capacity of a battery (in contrast to the static Design Capacity, the Maximum Capacity signals the health of the battery). Using a program (such as CoconutBattery) is not necessary.\nA script (still using ioreg) will reveal the battery temperature\n\nAppleSmartBattery Temperature: \n  30 °C\n  62.0 °F\n\nand so I'm hoping for a renewed answer in 2017 to the following question.\nHow can I view the CPU temperature from the command line? It would especially be nice to also see the GPU temperature. OS X just crashed and rebooted on its own, and the Console logs (\"Event: GPU Reset\" and \"GPU HangState 0x00000000\") suggest that the GPU might be the culprit. I'm trying to determine if it's time to reapply the thermal paste and reattach the heatsinks (never done this before; not even sure it's within my ability).\n\nA: It looks like a suitable solution might be in one of the less-voted answers on the question you linked:\n\nThis open source command line utility worked for me:\n  https://github.com/lavoiesl/osx-cpu-temp.\nM.

QC35's are linked to both my iPhone and my Mac but when I connect the headphones to my Mac (without pairing to my iPhone) the sound is choppy (brief & frequent loss in audio). \nSometimes pairing my iPhone fixes the problem but not always. What can I do?\n\nA: UPDATE: I no longer experience these issues so it was likely fixed by a previous update. Open the \"Bose Connect\" app on your phone and make sure your firmware is up to date.\n\nWhen experiencing issues on Mac, open the \"Bose Connect\" app on your iPhone and connect to your headphones from there (if not already connected).\nThe app correctly configures the headphones and eliminates all sound issues.\n\nA: The sound quality of the Bose QC35 when connected to mac depends on the used audio codec. Sadly, mac computers tend to switch to the low-quality SCO codec when a Bluetooth headset is also used as \"input device\" (microphone).\nActive codec can be shown by by ⌥-clicking the Bluetooth icon in the macOS Menu Bar.\n\nCurrent best practice is to set the Internal Microphone of your mac as Input Device, and keep the Bose QC35 only selected as Output Device. Input and Output devices can be selected in System Settings > Sound or by ⌥-clicking the Volume icon in the macOS Menu Bar, and selecting devices there.\nWhen the Bose QC35 is not used as an Input Device, mac audio playback can leverage the higher quality AAC codec:\n\n\nA: My headphones were also skipping occasionally dropping a few milliseconds that was barely noticeable, but drove me nuts. Didn't matter what device I used as the source.\nI was just able to update the firmware using the official Bose app and that seems to have fixed it!

The option to convert to APFS is grayed out. Is there any way I can convert my drive to APFS?\nI also tried to format my external hard drives as APFS. I was able to do that only ONCE. When I tried to do it on my second external hard drive, APFS wasn’t even offered. Does anyone know why I can’t format my second hard drive as APFS?\n\nA: According to various threads I’ve read, there are a number of factors that may prevent you from converting to APFS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Third-party SSDs are not supported.\n\n*Rotational hard drives and fusion drives were supported in Developer Preview 1, but support was removed in Developer Preview 2 (Public Beta 1) due to catastrophic failures.\n\n*FileVault may need to be disabled before the conversion is allowed.\n\n*External drives may need to be unmounted.\n\n\nA: FYI -- in beta 13 (Sept 1) -- HDD-only Macs cannot be converted to APFS.

I have an Apple Store Gift Card that was found in a drawer from 2009 (8 years ago). The associated papers said it was for $150. The scratch-off material covering the PIN had never been removed. \nWhen I checked the balance, the PIN and card # were recognized, but the site said the balance was $0. I checked the balance here: https://secure1.store.apple.com/shop/giftcard/balance\nDo these cards ever expire?  If not, how did it lose its value if the PIN had never before been uncovered?\nNote: This is not an iTunes gift card. That's different. \nAdditional information: This is an OLD card. It doesn't appear to be the type that can be recognized by scanning. It does have a bar code, but the bar code is not in a box like the new cards. It also has a magnetic stripe. I couldn't figure out how to enter it into Apple Wallet or Apple Store apps. The front of the card is blank silver with white apple logo. The gift card number is 16 digits and the PIN is 8 digits. \n\nA: I've never seen one expire. You can enter it in your wallet app if you have an iPhone and the balance will come down from Apple's servers.

In the first scenario, I have a script containing all of my handlers and snippets.  The filename for this script is “Jimz_Handlerz.scpt” and it is located here… /Users/Smokestack/Library/Script Libraries\nCalling the handler from a new AppleScript file requires me to declare my script library (line 1) and then I can call the handler at anytime I want with the second line.  Like this:\nuse myHandlerz : script \"Jimz_Handlerz.scpt\"\n\nmyHandlerz's get_fileExtensions()\n\nIn this next scenario, I am using the “load script” command to load the exact same file as the first example but this file is located on the desktop\nproperty jimzHandlerz : load script ¬\n    (alias \"Macintosh HD:Users:Smokestack:Desktop:Jimz_Handlerz.scpt\")\n\njimzHandlerz's get_fileExtensions()\n\nThis is the actual handler containing the command I am calling from both different scenarios.. \non get_fileExtensions()\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set theDownloadsfolder to (path to downloads folder)\n        set theFiles to the name extension of every file of theDownloadsfolder\n    end tell\n    AST copy list theFiles without keeping duplicates -- Needs AppleScript Toolbox 2_0_8.osax Scripting Addition in /Users/\"Name\"/Library/ScriptingAdditions\nend get_fileExtensions\n\nSo I guess my question is,  are there situations I would rather use scenario one and other situations where scenario two would be better?\nUpdate:\nHere is a cool little tidbit of information: Using the scenario of calling handlers from a script library script or script bundle file as in the first example of my original question.. If the current script, that we are calling on an external script from a library, is a script bundle and we include a folder inside the “Resources” folder called “Script Libraries” containing the script or script bundle we are calling our external handlers from, if the file in the system “Script Libraries” folder cannot be found, then this script will not throw an error because it searches the resources folder also for script libraries.\n\n\nA: I have added a “script logger” to the beginning of every one of my scripts, which basically writes to file…. The script name and the time and date it was last run.\nAll of the commands for the logging, reside in a script object located in a separate file “Jimz_Handlerz.scptd” used as a script library which is located in my script libraries folder.\n\nThis following code, which is located in the file “Jimz_Handlerz.scptd”, is the script object which handles the logging\nscript scriptRunLog2\n    try\n        writeToFile()\n    end try\n\n    on writeToFile()\n        set currentDate to (current date) as string\n        -- The \".\" At The Beginning Of The Filename In The Next Line\n        -- Makes That File A \"Hidden\" File\n        set theFile to (path to desktop as text) & \".script_run_log.txt\" \n        set theFile to POSIX path of theFile\n        set myName to name of (info for (path to me))\n        set theText to myName & \" was last run on \" & currentDate\n        try\n            set writeToFile to open for access theFile with write permission\n            write theText & linefeed to writeToFile as text starting at eof\n            close access theFile\n        on error errMsg number errNum\n            close access theFile\n            set writeToFile to open for access theFile with write permission\n            write theText & linefeed to writeToFile starting at eof\n            close access theFile\n        end try\n    end writeToFile\nend script\n\n\nThere are two ways of which I can run the commands within that script object, from any other script file.\nOPTION 1  Using the \"load script\" option inserted at the top of any other script file\nproperty theLibrary : (path to home folder as text) & \"Library:Script Libraries:Jimz_Handlerz.scptd\"\nproperty jimzHandlerz : load script alias theLibrary\nrun jimzHandlerz's scriptRunLog2\n\n\nOPTION 2  Using the \"use\" option inserted at the top of any other script file.

Input File:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kind: MPEG-4 File\n\n*Size: 305 MB\n\n*Dimensions: 640 x 360\n\n*Codecs: H.264, AAC\n\n*Duration: 52:07\n\n*Audio Channels: 2\n\n\nAfter using iMovie to trim a bit from the beginning and end of the file, I tried to export the file via File → Share → File… with the following settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format: Video and Audio\n\n*Resolution: 720p (iMovie only offers me 540p as alternative)\n\n*Quality: High (according to an answer to a similar question this means H.264)\n\n*Compress: Better Quality\n\n\nThe estimation on file size shown by iMovie is 4.35 GB. My questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How come the file size increases after I cut something from it, encoded both with H.264?  \n\n*Why does iMovie not offer me the input resolution as an output resolution?\n\n\nI'd like to be able to trim a video and save it with roughly the same size/time ratio.\n\nA: 720p resolution is 1280×720, which equates to quadruple the number of pixels vs. your original 640×360 (360p) movie. This alone would account for a huge jump in storage size.\nYou'll want to output in 540p instead (960×540). However this will still produce a video with 2.25× the number of pixels, so the resulting video may or may not still be larger.\nAs to why you can’t output in 360p, this appears to be a design decision by Apple (possibly to steer us towards Final Cut Pro), because earlier versions of iMovie allowed more granularity. In fact, in iMovie 10.0, 480p was still available, but as of iMovie 10.1, it’s gone. I suggest you voice your concerns to Apple.\nLastly, I should point out that Low, Medium and High Quality settings  all encode in H.264. They just use different encoding profiles/levels, with varying bitrates. From the figures you provided, I’d say your original video wasn’t produced using a profile equivalent to iMovie’s High setting. So you’ll probably want to try Medium or even Low.\nIf you still can’t keep your file size down encoding in 540p and using a lower profile, you can still down-sample it through Handbrake. However the upscaling-downscaling is sure to lower your video quality by some token amount. So it's a tradeoff.\n\nA: I had the same problem as you. I searched all over and gave up on improving iMovie which is using x264 anyway.\nInstead, I used ffmpeg (https://www.ffmpeg.org/). It worked like a charm. My following command reduced the iMovie video size in average 1/5th.\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx265 -crf 20 output.mp4\n\nNote how it's using the better codec of x265.\nIf you are considering EC2 Cloud9 like me, consider installing ffmpeg with this instruction (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Centos).\n\nA: One of the possible solutions I came up with is you upload your video to YouTube and YouTube would help you reduce the size with good quality at the same time. Finally, you just download back the file from YouTube.\n\nA: I had a similar issue input file from my iPhone was 140MB at 1080p the edited version with 30secs removed exported at 720p with iMovie was 94MB.\nI always use AVC (Any Video Converter) the free version and it exported at 720p using default settings this reduced it to 9MB with no loss of quality 1/10th the size!\nNot sure why iMovie is so bloaty. I have to do this on a lot of videos at work as we stream them over the network.\n", "Q: How to Backup Email on Apple Mail? I am new to this Mac world and on the first day of my new job my boss gave me a tedious task to Backup Emails on Apple Mail. Basically, there are 3 email ids, and these are our support email database. So there are tons of emails stacked in the inbox. I have to backup all the emails, contact list, and even the address book. I had a look online for manual procedures and found out that Apple Mail Export and Time Machine Backup are best suited for these backup issues. I did try them, but the problem is they are taking too long. I need a quick solution to Backup emails on Apple Mail. \nAre there other alternatives to Backup emails on Apple Mail that are quick, safe and easy to operate? Do let me know asap. Thanks\n\nA: The thing with backups is that they're just a copy of your data at a given point in time. Now, keep that in mind for a moment as I continue to offer another possible solution below (but read my caution afterwards).\nIt seems to me from your question you're just wanting a quick drag and copy solution. So, for instance, you could just make a copy of your Apple Mail data. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder\n\n*Press and hold the option key while you click on the Go menu\n\n*Select Library\n\n*You can let go of the option key now\n\n*Within the Library folder you'll see a folder called Mail\n\n*Copy this folder (just right-click on the folder and select Copy \"Mail\", or press command+C)\n\n*Navigate to where you want to save your backup (obviously another drive!)\n\n*Now you can paste a copy (e.g. by pressing command+V)\n\n\nThere you have it, you've made a copy of all your Mail data. \nA word of caution\nHowever, you really need to consider if this will achieve the ultimate aim of what your boss wants? Remember I previously mentioned this was just a copy at a given point in time. This means if a month later you have a hard drive failure and need to restore your Mail backup, the data you'll restore is a month old (unless you've made a more recent copy - but that's something you have to remember to do manually). \nThis is where backup software (such as Time Machines) comes in. Time Machine automatically makes regular backups. Yes, the very first time TM makes a backup it will take a long time. However, after the initial backup, all subsequent backups take much less time. You may want to read: Use Time Machine to back up or restore your Mac.\nFinally, there are other options to Time Machine, such as Carbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper!\n\nA: Are you using all the 3 emails on different systems? If yes then you can simply export the email database from Apple Mail export option and you will have your backup with you.  \nHere's how you can export and backup your apple mail database:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH19174?locale=en_US\nAlso as explained above if Time Machine is setup then your emails must be backing up automatically. You just need to find the backed up emails.  To find them >  Click on your mail icon > Inbox > and once you have the screen showing, go to Time machine icon and click that.   Wait a moment or so and then the screen will allow you to go back to previous mail inbox dates.   The system works with sent mails and other subsections too.    It does not work with Junk mail.\nOne other option other than Apple Mail Export and Time Machine that I found online is: http://www.mailbackupx.com/ (please note that this is a paid application)\n", "Q: iOS: How can I view more Unicode?

Most of these are not visible on iOS and either appear blank or as a question mark inside a box despite being directly accessible through the character viewer on a Mac.\nHow can I view these characters on iOS?\n\nA: You would have to add fonts to your iOS device which contain the characters which are missing.  This can be done with various apps from the app store, like Anyfont.\nYou might try the font Symbola.\n", "Q: Deleting Terminal app using App cleaner I was experimenting how strong SIP is on Sierra. So I tried To delete Terminal.app using app cleaner but I can remove the contents then when I empty the trash it empties it. Then I open terminal App it works Fine.So is SIP that strong that you can't remove an OS X app using third Party apps?Is the only way to remove SIP protected apps using rm command?\n\nA: Third party tools and rm can not delete System Integrity Protection (SIP) protected files.\nTo remove Terminal.app from your Mac, you would first need to disable SIP.\nSystem Integrity Protection on your Mac means you can not delete or modify a range of important files and applications. See About System Integrity Protection on your Mac for what and how SIP protects you.\n", "Q: How to install Visual Studio Code's `code` command permanently?

Are the screenshots of apps in the app switcher stored in RAM, or are they instead stored in flash, and streamed directly to the GPU via some kind of DMA (direct memory access) connection?\nRAM is precious, and after a few days I end up with a lot of apps in my app switcher. Are all those snapshots constantly using up RAM?\n\nA: They survive a restart so they canonically exist in storage.\nOf course, everything you see on screen has to be in RAM, too; so the answer is both. \n\nA: I forgot the precise location, but they are either stored in the data folder of the application, or the app's cache folder in the filesystem (probably was both on iOS 9 – can't speak for newer iOS versions). This is possible to see if you have read access to the filesystem (such as when you are jailbroken)\n\nA: From what I remember the state should be saved under the user library directory (probably only accessible jailbroken) and, if following the OS X method, should be stored in a parent directory called SavedApplicationState and children directories inside it will be named after their identifiers (e.g., com.apple.Safari). \nThe preview png should be in there but I'm not totally sure of the name/location. \n", "Q: Is it possible to undo the last digit entered on my iPhone's calculator? I use Apple's Calculator iPhone app all the time. Being human, I regularly make mistakes (or maybe my fingers are too big) and end up entering the wrong digit. But the iPhone’s “undo” function doesn’t work with the Calculator app. Is there any way to undo the last digit I’ve entered? Or do I have to clear everything and start again?\n\nA: Yes, there is an easy way to undo the last entry. \nAll you have to do is swipe the top of the calculator, in either direction. By ‘top’ I mean where the digits appear. This will clear the last digit you entered. If you swipe it again, then it’ll clear the next digit, and so on.\n\nAs a follow up, I agree there is some inconsistency here. I also agree with some of the comments below. Why it is I can shake my iPhone to undo something in other apps, but can’t do the same with the Calculator app, is beyond me. That said, I actually don’t like the whole shake function for undo. I’d much rather prefer a hard press on the screen (or some other input method) to be given the choice to undo. Basically I think it should be one of the options available in the same list as cut, cop, paste etc. If you happen to agree, you can submit feedback to Apple.\n", "Q: Remap touch bar control keys, e.g., Siri I'd like to customize what the keys in my Macbook Pro's touch bar do. For instance, I have no interest in Siri but I'd be great to have the Siri key be the hotkey for iterm2 for instance.\nIs there a way to customize the action for the \"system\" part of the touch bar's keys?\n\nA: Whilst you can't completely customise the actions provided in the control strip, you can replace or remove buttons with other Apple-provided buttons. Go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Customise Control Strip… and replace the buttons on the Touch Bar with any other options.\n", "Q: MBP E2015 Sierra keyboard/trackpad unresponsive My Early 2015 13\" MBP's keyboard and trackpad quit working a few days ago. I thought it might be the logic board. But it’s definitely not. The power button (on the keyboard) works fine. \nI tried a few things (below) more than a handful of times. Eventually, I realized I could just plug in an external USB keyboard & mouse. By that time my Mac was trying to get me to disable FileVault in some weird boot mode that I've never seen. So I did. \nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*SMC reset (actually worked -- confirmed with the power adapter light)\n\n*PRAM reset & all other boot options -- totally unresponsive\n\n*used nvram -c in the terminal to reset the PRAM -- verified this worked \n\n*disabled filevault -- nothing\n\n*booted into USB installer to test keyboard and mouse -- nothing\n\n\nNone of the above things worked -- I also tried various SMC resets and PRAM resets after each steps and in different orders.\nHere's the important thing: even with an external keyboard, no boot options work... except SMC resets. Which leads me to ask... is something wrong with the kernel?\nI've tried safe boot, verbose boot, PRAM resets, recovery mode all from on computer keyboard and external keyboard. Nothing is responsive at time of boot. \nI should note, I'm writing this from the MBP with external keyboard & mouse.\n\nA: I did some research and apparently, the early 2015 MBP is known for having trackpad/keyboard cable issues. I reset the cable and boom it works!\n", "Q: Building a Xcode project downloaded from GitHub I am just starting to learn about code and programming apps.\nI downloaded Xcode project source-code for a mac app that I wish to use from GitHub.\nHow can I turn that code into an executable application?\nThe repository readme states 3 steps to build the project. I am done with the first 2 steps, but I don't know how to complete the last one.\nCan someone help me understand the difference between an archive build and a run/debug, and how to do them in Xcode?\n\nA: The help menu works great in Xcode. If you search for each term listed in Step 3, the menu items you need will be shown to you in Xcode. \n\nRunning a Mac app is trivial - click the play button in the toolbar - you don’t need any simulator or certificates or setup or choosing a scheme like the image above indicates. \nSince you are new, I would also spend time in the Xcode documentation on getting started.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/9.0/#/devc8c2a6be1\nYou will get alerts in the activity area if anything fails - the project you are starting with has made hundreds of decisions in the project file, dozens of which would take me several weeks to digest (spending an hour a day on this alone) and understand at a cursory level. I’m not a full time developer, but I have been compiling and making Mac apps since the late 80s and I still need to read the documents, watch wwdc videos and ask questions online. Good luck and don’t worry if you have lots of work ahead to find and fix any compile errors or if you have start a new project to learn how Xcode works step by step. \n", "Q: iPhone issues and Apple ID I got an iPhone from a friend and he’s far away at the moment but the phone has a software issue. I wanted to wipe the phone and restore it to a “new” state, but I was told it’ll require an Apple ID.\nCan I enter my current Apple ID, or do I need to contact my friend to provide his password?\n\nA: You bumped into what’s known as Activation Lock.This iPhone is still locked to your friend’s Apple ID, and order to change ownership, your friend will need to provide his Apple ID password for you.\nSince your friend is far away, they may be able to disable Activation Lock remotely, by logging in to iCloud.com.\nHave them go into Find my iPhone and select the iPhone. Since you’ve already wiped it, it will show as offline and grayed out. Just click Remove from Account.\n\n", "Q: How do I apply Apple ID verification on an iPod touch running iOS 6.1.6? I've reset my iPod Touch running iOS 6.1.6. Now every time I try to login to iTunes after putting in my Apple ID and password it asks for an Apple ID verification code, which has been texted to my phone.\nHowever there is no place coming up to submit this verification code.\n\nA: Append the verification code to the end of your usual password, then attempt to sign in. This is necessary on login prompts which don't support 2FA, such as those on older versions of iOS.\n", "Q: Save the order or a column I have some words in column B. They are sorted by a personal criterion, nothing that Apple Numbers can consider:\n\nAt a certain point, I want to organize the information by another criterion. For instance, to make it simple, sort ascending:\n\nIs there a way I can go back to the first picture?\n(Here I simplify the case. Of course, I could cmd z, but that is not the point. I am looking for an easy way to save a specific order even after I close the file o even days later)\nWhat I have tried: \nThis is a simplified case. In real live I have several files with thousands of rows in each file. I cannot create a column and give them a number of reference manually. I tried to create a column and generate the order this way:\n1- I put 1 in A1\n2- Put A1+1 in A2\n3- Copy paste the formula in the other columns. Or drag the yellow point, it's the same\n4- Create another column and \"paste results\" (When I sort by the B column the formula column will change. That's why I need that extra step and create a column with only numbers)\nThis works, but it seems complicated and I need to do it many times. Is there any other way to save the order that is easier, simpler?\n\nA: Simply create an Index column.  1, 2, 3 etc. (As pjctec mentions in comments.). Without some ordered list or index, there is no way for Numbers to know how to use a custom sort.\nThere is no need to use a formula to create the list of numbers.\n\n\n*\n\n*In A1 enter 1\n\n*In A2 enter 2\n\n*In A3 enter 3\n\n*Select cells A1 to A3\n\n*Drag the yellow dot down.\n\n\nSorting will not change the numbers as they are static.  No need to use a formula.\nThen you can always sort the index column later.  If needed, the column can be hidden or shown when needed.\nApple supplies a good resource for Numbers basics on their Website. Numbers Help. Recommended for new users and anyone who wants to get the most out of using Numbers.\n\n", "Q: Slow motion camera feature on iPod? I am thinking of obtaining an iPod (any generation) for recording slow-motion videos, like the ones that can be shot on an iPhone 5s and above.\nIs there an iPod that can do slo-mo, or is an iPhone the only option?\n\nA: The iPod touch 6 has a camera equivalent to that in the iPhone 6.\nAs such it is the first (and as of August 2017, the only) iPod that can record slo-mo video, at 120 frames per second in 720p resolution.\n\nThe iPod touch features an 8MP rear iSight camera with video which can record in 1080p at 30fps, or 120fps in slow-motion mode that records at 720p. \n\n", "Q: Hard drive constraints and operating system for 2009 13\" macbook I was given a 2009 13\" macbook, but it needs a new hard drive and operating system.\nWhat is the most current OS it can handle and how much space does that OS take when freshly installed?\n\nA: Your MacBook can support anything up to and including High Sierra (the next OS release), but will not have Handoff due to the computer not supporting Bluetooth 4.0.\nsource\nAs for the install space, lifewire’s article says that you should have 16GB of space minimum for the install, though 32GB is recommended. \n", "Q: Where/how did this menu-bar application implant itself? After installing a given application that shows an icon in the menu bar, I would like to delete it. A sudo rm -fr /Applications/foobar.app, followed by a reboot, is insufficient; the menu bar application runs again. And I don't see it running among my login items in the first place.\n\nMight the app be lurking in ~/Library? Apparently not. Only a database and log files are there.\n> find ~/Library -name \"foobar\" -print\nLibrary/Application Support/foobar\nLibrary/Logs/foobar\n\nWhere might such an app have implanted itself, and how does it run at startup when it does not appear among the Login items?\nUpdate\nThis behavior has been changed in High Sierra. A widget that positions itself in the menu-bar does not survive, even though it needs sudo permission before doing so. The permission is needed again.\n\nA: To uninstall iStat Menus, please choose iStat Menus > Uninstall from the menubar, then click Uninstall. This works, even if your trial period is over. I think the uninstall process from iStat Menu themselves will do a lot more then only deleting the app itself.\n\nYou can also find the uninstaller in Macintosh HD > Library > Application Support > iStat local > Uninstaller.app\nOr delete:\n\n\n*\n\n*Library > LauchAgents > com.bjango.istatlocal.plist\n\n*Library > LaunchDaemons > com.bjango.istatlocaldaemon.plist\n\n\nSo far the iStat Menu specific part. More general information:\nDeleting the app alone is not enough. There are LaunchAgents, LaunchDaemons, Preferences, Applications Support folders, Cache etc which also needs to be deleted to remove an application completely.\n", "Q: How can I transfer iMessage/SMS messages from Mac to iPhone? I have a huge problem. I’ve restored my iPhone without first making a backup. I have all my iMessage/SMS conversations on my Mac (macOS Sierra).\nIs there a way I can transfer those conversations to my iPhone?\n\nA: Starting with iOS 11.4 and macOS 10.13.5 High Sierra, Messages in iCloud lets your messages sync across devices over iCloud.\nOn iOS, you enable this feature by toggling Messages under Settings → General → [Your Name] → iCloud.\nOn macOS, open the Messages app, then go to Messages → Preferences… → Accounts → iMessage and check Enable Messages in iCloud.\nThis feature will upload all the messages from each of your devices to iCloud, and merge them with messages uploaded from other devices.\nFrom there, each device will only keep a cached copy of recent conversations, and download additional messages from iCloud whenever you try to view them. Once the merge/sync is complete, if you delete a message in one location, it will be deleted from all your devices.\nNote that both iMessages and SMS/MMS are included as part of Messages in iCloud.\nAs a bonus, just like iCloud Photo Library, your messages will no longer be backed up as part of your daily iCloud Backup. This should save you storage in iCloud by no longer requiring duplicate backups of your messages for each of your iOS devices.\n", "Q: How to uninstall Preference Panes? I am running OS X Sierra on a MacBook Air. I don't remember exactly how, but quite some time ago I installed CUDA on my Mac (I was a newb then, I didn't know I wouldn't be able to run it without an NVIDIA GPU).\nSo after installation I was always greeted by this box upon login:\n\nI wanted to remove this and all other traces of CUDA from my system. I did locate cuda and deleted all the files which seemed related to CUDA. There were some occurrences of CUDA in OpenCV and Homebrew which seemed useful, so I kept them.\nThe good thing is that I am no longer greeted by this message at startup, but I can still see the link to the CUDA Preferences in my System Preferences (see circled area on bottom left):\n\nEvery time I click on this icon, System Preferences \"quits unexpectedly\". This means that there are still traces of CUDA left on my machine. How can I remove it completely?\n\nA: The Easy Way to Uninstall Preference Panes\nRemove preference panes with just a click or two:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch System Preferences by clicking the System Preferences icon in the Dock, or by selecting System Preferences from the Apple menu.\n\n*Right-click the preference pane you wish to remove. (This tip only works for preference panes listed under the Other category.)\n\n*Select Remove xxxx Preference Pane from the pop-up menu, where xxxx is the name of the preference pane you wish to remove.\n\n\n\nThis will remove the preference pane, no matter where it was installed on your Mac, saving you the time it would have taken to track down the installation location.\nIf for some reason the easily uninstall method doesn't work, you can use the manual method outlined below.\n \nRemoving Preference Panes Manually\nSystem preferences are located in one of two places on your Mac. The first location is used for preference panes that are only used by you.\nYou'll find these personal preference panes located in your home folder in the Library/PreferencePanes directory.\n\n\n*\n\n*~/YourHomeFolderName/Library/PreferencePanes\n\n\nThe other location for system preference panes is in the system library folder. This location is used for preference panes that can be used by any user who has an account on your Mac.\nYou'll find the public preference panes located at:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/PreferencePanes\n\n\nOnce you figure out which folder a preference pane is located in, you can use the Finder to go to that folder and drag the unwanted preference pane to the trash.\n", "Q: Missing \"Use as Defaults\" box in \"Show View Options\" I am trying to change the default size of my icons and their grid spacing as was asked in this question. For whatever reason, my Mac does not have a Use as Defaults box in Show View Options.

Any ideas on how I can fix this?\n\n\nA: All My Files isn't a folder, it's a special view in Finder. Navigate to a real folder such as your Documents folder and the View Options window will show a Use as Defaults button then.\n", "Q: Hide External Drive icon on Mac Desktop On my desktop I have an external drive name 4TB_Drive.  On the same desktop I have a backup drive for the first one named 4TB_Drive_BU.

Any problem with using a newer Mac laptop to install macOS Sierra onto an external hard drive, then install into an older Mac laptop? (assuming both Macs are Sierra-capable, obviously)\nAre there any issues with booting and running an older Mac from a macOS created with a newer Mac? For example, does the Sierra installer install drivers specific to the Mac on which the Sierra installer app ran?\n\nA: This should work fine; the installer will install all drivers needed for all supported Mac models, so you can move drives between models pretty freely.\nUpdate: Starting with High Sierra, this is no longer supported. The OS itself will be fine, but unless you run the High Sierra installer on that computer, and with a live Internet connection, the computer's firmware may not be properly updated to support the new OS. According to Apple support article HT208020:\n\nIf you try to use a monolithic system image [equivalent to\n  transferring an HD with the OS installed], required firmware updates\n  will be missing from the installation. This causes the Mac to operate\n  in an unsupported and unstable state.\n\nSee this TidBITS article for more info.\nBTW, just to give you some idea of the possibilities for trouble: there was an issue with Mac OS X v10.2 (yes, long ago) where if you installed it on an iMac DV model that hadn't had its firmware updated, it did something bad to the video configuration, and the display would be blank. The display would remain blank, even if you booted back into an older version. This made it really hard to run the firmware updater and make the computer usable again. I was working in a repair shop at the time, and we had a lot of iMacs come in with this problem.\nI suspect the current firmware compatibility worries have to do with compatibility with the new APFS volume format, so the worst that should happen is that an un-updated Mac won't be able to boot from a High Sierra volume in APFS format. Probably. Maybe. No promises, though.\n\nA: You should install HighSierra on that older computer. You may use the installer file from any computer, since that download is mac unspecific.\n", "Q: Correct Sierra 10.12.5 file paths to Spotlight and SpotlightNetHelper files to be blocked with Little Snitch? The article belowmentions using LittleSnitch for blocking Spotlight and SpotlightNetHelper:\nSpotlight makes repeated http requests\nIt includes two screenshots. The first image shows two separate paths, which are dived by an arrow, to the correct files to block while the second image shows one path. \n\n\nWhat are the correct paths to use for Sierra 10.12.5 as these apparently can't be found via searches:\nI was able to find the first path on the first window:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Spotlight.app/Contents/MacOS/Spotlight\nThe second path is cut off on the first window and can't be determined.\nThe path listed in the second can be found until the point I get to the \"A\" folder, but the last bit \"/Support/SpotlightNetHelper.App\" can't be navigated to.\n\nA: In macOS Sierra, SpotlightNetHelper was removed and the standard WebKit networking is used instead, located at /System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.WebKit.Networking.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.WebKit.Networking.\nThere are various apps and processes which use this for networking, so you can't simply block it entirely without affecting those too. However you can set up a specific rule to prevent it connecting to Apple's services for Spotlight, which would prevent Spotlight using it to talk out, as shown in the first screenshot where the rule is ‘Spotlight via com.apple.WebKit.Networking’.\n", "Q: Does Exchange enable MDM automatically on iOS? My employer recommended that I sign into our corporate email (Google hosted) via Exchange in the Mail app. I found out later that by doing so, I automatically enabled MDM or allowed them to set policies on my phone. (We learned this when another employee lost their iPhone and our IT department helped to lock it with their console.) \nI did not install any profile or certificate and those tabs are empty/missing in my settings. Nothing stood out in the signin flow either (I certainly wouldn't have pressed \"Allow your employer to access X\" buttons.)\nDoes using Exchange automatically enroll you in an MDM policy? Is there a way to opt out or continue using Exchange w/o giving up my rights?\n\nA: I'm not sure if it could be done automatically when you sign into an exchange account. If your device is under MDM policy you will find a configuration profile in the Settings.\nHow to delete a configuration profile on iOS\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings on your iOS device.\n\n*Go to the section General → Profiles & Device Management, or Settings → General → Profiles.\n\n*Tap on a configuration profile you would like to remove from your iOS device.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Tap Delete Profile at the bottom of the configuration profile screen.\n\n*Enter your passcode, if required.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Confirm that you would like to remove the selected configuration profile from your device by tapping Delete. When you delete a profile, all of the settings and accounts associated with the profile are also removed.\n\n*It is always a good idea to restart your iOS device after removing a profile.\n\n", "Q: Downloading 32 bit iOS Apps for 32 bit iPhones after iOS 11 is released I have a 32-bit iPhone.  I understand that 32 bit iPhones will no longer be supported by iOS 11.  \nWill I be able to download and buy 32 bit apps from the store for iPhones running 32-bit iOS versions (ie iOS 10.x) after iOS 11 is released?  \nIn other words, is Apple removing 32bit apps from the store completely or just removing them for iOS 11 devices?\n\nA: While Apple is moving to 64-bit apps on the App Store, that doesn't mean they're 64-bit only apps. In fact any new apps published since 1 February 2015 has had to support 64-bit. This is also the case for any updates to existing apps (i.e. they also must be 64-bit compatible). \nIn other words, any 32-bit only apps submitted to Apple will be rejected, but if that same app also supports 64-bit, then it'll be available for both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of iOS etc.\nIn summary, any app that:\n\n\n*\n\n*is only 32-bit is on borrowed time\n\n*is only 64-bit is fine\n\n*that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit will be fine\n\n\nA: iOS 11 will not support the apps because they are removing the architecture support from the OS. Apple is not changing the store. In the future you may find 32bit versions to be unavailable due to applications dropping support for older architectures however this isn't because Apple is forcing them but because they see it as unimportant \n", "Q: Where are all of the different Python Copies Installed?

(feel free to skip this)\nThe (2008) Macbook is my personal laptop but Windows one is for work. I want to avoid using work laptop if possible. I'm taking classes for professional exams and my LMS software is compatible with only windows.

I have exams in 3 months.\n\nA: Apart from the fact that you'd have to ring Microsoft to reinstate your licence every time you swapped, Windows is not very good at swapping hardware. \nA Mac drive can be used to boot any Mac older than the OS on the drive; Windows doesn't work that way, you'd need a bare-metal clone & install the correct drivers every time.\n", "Q: What is the HD proximity sensor in a 2009 iMac? iStat Menus 5 is displaying a dash after this sensor - HD proximity sensor.\nI'm getting a temp reading from the HD.\nI've opened this iMac several times and have never seen a connection for the HD proximity sensor.  Is it part of the HD temp sensor?\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure I'm understanding your question exactly, but the 2009 iMac has six temperature sensors. The HD proximity sensor refers to a sensor that's not physically connected to the HD itself, but is near the HD. \nSome software (typically utilities that control fan speeds or provide monitoring data) will use proximity sensors to get a pretty good guesstimate of the actual temperature of certain hardware components. There are various reasons why a proximity sensor may be used in addition to (or instead of) a directly connected sensor.\nThe aforementioned utilities will use these readings for various reasons (e.g. to determine fan speeds where the user has chosen to override the default System Management Controller (SMC) for this purpose). In most cases it's just to display the data to the end user for monitoring purposes.\nIn your case iStat Menus 5 is simply showing you the temperature reading of this particular sensor. I suspect the dash \"-\" next to it indicates that your iMac does not have a HD proximity sensor.\n", "Q: How can I type a backtick using a German keyboard?

I'm not sure if it's possible but I'd like to disable color management on OS X, or at least when working with Photoshop and Illustrator. The problem is that no matter what I do in both application when trying to set a color mode, a color profile or the Proof Color options, both apps are showing different colors for the same image.\nHere is a screenshot with how it looks when I have both application windows with one part over the built-in monitor and the other over an external monitor.\n\nAlso, when I was tracking down the issue, I discovered that when dragging the windows from one monitor to the other, the colors look like if the window is still on the first monitor, but then change to how they look in the second monitor after I stop dragging the window. This makes me thing that is not a color calibration issue, but rather something with the way the app manage the color profile for that monitor.\nSo, is there a way to solve this problem? maybe disabling color management at all for the whole system, or only for some applications?\n\nA: There are two problems.\nFirstly: color management is an integral part of MacOS's graphics engine. \n\n\"Active color management is a dynamic process, applied to every pixel\n  in real time on every frame. For each pixel, a color match is performed\n  from the source content's profile space to the destination space,\n  possibly with an intermediate space or working space (requiring an\n  additional color match) in between.\"\n\nIt cannot be turned off: every color value exists within a color profile space.\nTo complicate matters further, Adobe applications such as Photoshop and Illustrator have their own color management 'on top' of MacOS. They can define their own source profile spaces, and specify how color is handled from documents using the same or different working spaces. \nIt used to be possible to turn off Adobe's Color management in old versions, but this has not been the case for some time. \nUsing Creative Suite 6, I can save an RGB .psd file from Photoshop (with profile embedded) and open it in Illustrator, and the colors will be identical (both to my eye and using Digital Color Meter.app).\nIt's possible you may want to try trashing the pref files for these apps, and see if that helps.\nHowever, if you are just getting different colors when viewing the same document on different displays, then you just need to calibrate the displays to be more similar.\n\nA: If you go into Settings > Displays > Color > Calibrate you should be able to make your display mirror the colors on your external display.\n\n\n\nA: Opening the Display Calibrator Assistant window shown in the above screenshot disables color management until the window is closed.\n", "Q: Turn off autocomplete event name internal to Apple's Calendar app on Mac OS?

I'm simply not interested in those past events anymore and I don't want to know about them. I use ical as a reminders system for tasks, i.e. as a todo list as well as calendar. I find that better than using a separate task app in addition.\nI'd love to find a way to turn these suggestions off, without having to delete all past events from my calendar history (which it looks like I might have to resort to).\nHaven't found a way to do this but would be very grateful if someone knows how.\n\nA: I've just done a clean install to Catalina and signed in to iCloud. Without any action on my part, I no longer get the autocomplete suggestions when making new events. But I did not intend to disable them.

We got all the way through logging in, but then App Store complained that the macOS 10.11 download was not available to him. Repeating with my AppleID showed that the download was available to me.  \nMy theory is now that macOS is only available if you have “purchased” it (or if it was otherwise registered as eligible). I thought that this could be fixed simply with having a user on an eligible system, but apparently not.\nWhat is the easiest way to reassign? Going back to 10.6 and then upgrading, sounds like a lot of work I'd like to avoid if possible.\n\nA: You will need to erase the disk to change ownership, not just reinstall macOS over the current install.\n\nYou should erase your startup disk in these circumstances:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You’re selling or giving away your Mac, so you’re clearing your Mac of anything associated with you, your data, or your Apple ID.\n  \n\nTo do that, boot into Recovery Mode by holding ⌘ cmd r during boot. Then follow Apple’s instructions for Erasing your startup disk and Reinstalling macOS:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Select Disk Utility from the utilities window of macOS Recovery, then click Continue.\n  \n*Select your startup disk in the sidebar of Disk Utility.\nSelect the disk name, not the volume name indented beneath\n  it.\n  \n*Click the Erase button or tab.   If you don’t see an erase button or tab, select the volume name indented beneath the disk name,\n  then look again.\n  \n*Complete these fields:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Name: Enter a name for your disk, such as “Macintosh HD”.\n  \n*Format: Choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n  \n*Scheme (if available): Choose GUID Partition Map.\n  \n  \n*Click Erase to begin erasing your disk.\n  \n*When done, quit Disk Utility to return to the utilities window.\n  \n*Choose Reinstall macOS from the utilities window.\n  \n*Click Continue, then follow the onscreen instructions. You’ll be asked to select a startup disk and click Install.\nTo verify eligibility to install macOS, your Mac serial number is sent to Apple, and you might be asked for your Apple\n  ID.\n  \n*Your Mac restarts to a setup assistant after installation is complete.\nComplete the setup assistant with your son’s information.\n\nCompleting Setup Assistant is what will assign the OS license to the owner’s Apple ID.\n\nA: The only MacOS that's a paid upgrade is Lion. You'll either need to buy a USB key (Apple sold them for a while - legitimately with a license, not the gray and black market installers you mostly see for sale these days) or call Apple Sales / AppleCare and buy a redemption code for your new account.\nOnce that's over, you can upgrade past 10.7 for free from the App Store as well as get free redemptions of iWork and iLife suites. Apple doesn't reassign licenses - so you need to get it again paid or redemption style in all cases where there isn't family sharing (which is only for iOS presently).\n", "Q: Run Macbook inside of Windows application I have desktop Windows PC with a large display and nice keyboard and mouse setup. I have a Macbook that I would like to use with the same setup. My monitor does not have any more available input ports.\nIs it possible to run a desktop session from my Macbook within a Windows application? I'm aware of VNC, however that seems to mirror what my Macbook is currently displaying. If possible, I'd like to run a new GUI session that runs at the correct resolution of my Windows display. Bonus points if I can leave my Macbook's lid closed whilst accessing it from Windows.\n\nA: You won't get closed clamshell mode unless you connect a display and power, but that's how I run many portable Mac so they do work well in that mode even if it's not what you look for specifically.\nThe Mac supports two log in users - so if you have one user logged in locally - you could VNC in with a second account and it will ask if you want to share the screen or have your own session.\nOne nice trick if you don't want to connect an actual display in closed clamshell mode, you can connect an adapter like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.amazon.com/CompuLab-fit-Headless-Display-Emulator/dp/B00FLZXGJ6\nShould be pretty straightforward for you to do either of these - it just takes connected items and/or two accounts.\n", "Q: Move 1Password vault from old Mac to new Mac? I did a clean install with a new hard drive in my MacBook, with old drive externally connected. \nHow do I move my 1Password vault from the old drive to the new drive?\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a single file I can copy?\n\n*If no single file approach, will File > Backup work?I have no idea how to do the restore. When I launch 1Password, it keeps asking for a \"Secret Password\" as well as a \"Master Password\". I have a \"Master Password\", but not a \"Secret Password\". Their documentation seems to suggest that the \"Secret Password\" is related to their newer online ongoing accounts. I have no interest in getting an online ongoing account, I only want the local storage option. \n\n*Is local \"syncing\" an option?Their documentation web site suggests \"synching\" a vault to a thumb drive. The doc talks about choosing the thumb drive in a \"file browser\", but their dialog box for \"syncing\" shows only a strange bread-crumb style path through several files. There is no way to redirect that bread-crumb path to the thumb drive. So I am stumped by that approach.\n\n\nAt this point I am giving up on 1Password, and just copy-pasting the passwords manually out to a text file. Surely there is a better way.\n\nA: Yes, there's a much simpler way. In fact, you have a number of options, but based on your question I recommend the following:\nOn your new Mac\nDo as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install 1Password on your new Mac\n\n*When it launches the first time you'll see a screen similar to the one below:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Select the More Options... option to reveal the Restore from Backup option.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click on the Choose Backup... button\n\n*Navigate to where 1Password has saved its automated backups on your old Mac (if your Macs are not networked, then copy the backup onto a Flash drive first and use this for the new Mac)\n\n*Click the Restore button\n\n\nNOTE: As mentioned above there are a number of ways you can do this. You may want to read the How to move your 1Password data to a new computer or device for other options.\n", "Q: How do I back up videos using IFTTT, not just photos or is there an alternative? I created an IFTTT applet to backup photos from my camera roll to Google Drive, which is syncing to my Mac. I created a folder action to move all files from that Google Drive folder(~/Google Drive/IFTTT) to ~/Pictures/IFTTT. The photos backup fine, but the videos aren't even detected by IFTTT.\nHow can I get IFTTT to backup all my photos and videos?\nIf not, is there an alternative to back up both my photos and videos? I only want the photos backing up to my Mac, and not the cloud as I already use Google Photos.\n\nA: IFTTT does not support videos with iOS Photos.\nYou can, however, use Dropbox for iOS on your iOS device and enable Camera Uploads (Dropbox > Settings > Camera Uploads).\n", "Q: How do I AirDrop from a MacBook to its tethered iPhone? My MacBook (OSX Yosemite 10.10.5) is tethered to my iPhone (10.0.2) in order to provide Internet access.\nHow do I AirDrop from my Macbook to an app on my iPhone?\nCurrently I have to use Dropbox, ie. move the file into Dropbox, wait for the (possibly large file) to upload, then download it on my iPhone to the desired app (causing another sync).\n\nA: You will need to turn off Personal Hotspot before you can AirDrop.\nAirDrop transfers data over Wi-Fi between the two peer devices (in this case, your MacBook and your iPhone). Since your iPhone is providing a Personal Hotspot via Wi-Fi, that connection is not available for AirDrop.\nIf turning Personal Hotspot off and on repeatedly is too cumbersome, you can provide tethering through USB instead. Then your Wi-Fi connection will always be available for AirDrop.\n\nA: Like Phong said, you will need to turn off your Personal Hotspot before you can AirDrop since it is using the network from your phone. However your MacBook does not need to be on a Wi-Fi network in order to send or receive files through AirDrop. As long as both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are on on both of your devices, it can send the files without being connected to each other or the internet.\nTo send things through AirDrop on your Mac, simply right-click on the file(s) you want to send, mouse over share, then click on AirDrop. Then once your iPhone shows up, click send and click accept on your iPhone.\nIf you would like to know how AirDrop works, you can go here and it explains it in easy-to-understand terms: https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-airdrop-how-does-it-work-1994512\n\nA: Just in case in anyone is coming across this for a more recent version of macos (Catalina 10.15.5) and iOS (13.5.1) If I am tethered using Bluetooth, rather than Wi-Fi, I can use Personal Hotspot and Airdrop at the same time.\n", "Q: How can I provide useful feedback to Mac Photos software designers? I have been experiencing a number of issues since migrating from iPhoto to Photos, and I would like to provide useful input/feedback to the Apple software designers.\nWhat would the best way to do that?\n\nA: Apple does provide a feedback form where you can submit suggestions/complaints/ideas.\nYou won’t get a response, and there are no guarantees they will implement your ideas, but I’ve seen good evidence on a number of occasions that Apple does take such feedback seriously.\nWhen voicing your concerns just remember that respectful discourse is far more likely to make an impact.\n", "Q: How to start playing first song in playlist after all songs are over? I listen to music on my Mac every day. However after a playlist ends, playback stops and I have to hit Play manually to start playing the playlist again from the beginning.\nIs there anyway to restart a playlist automatically after it has finished playing the last song?\n\nA: Simply enable Repeat → All. Right-click iTunes on your Dock, and the option will appear.\n\nThere are several other locations, such as the menu bar item Controls → Repeat → All, or this icon at the top of your iTunes window, opposite the album art: \n", "Q: AppleScript: How to get the character count of an .rtf file? I would like an AppleScript .scpt file to determine the character count of any given .rtf file. I'm not sure if this is standard for character counts, but I would like each space character (\" \") to also count as one character.\nI would like the script to accomplish this, without actually opening the file in TextEdit. \nIt is important to note that this is a rich text file, not a simple plain text (.txt) file. This fact complicates things. It is not as simple as chopping off the rich text header, because a single .rtf file may contain multiple different types of rich text formatting.\nWhat is the best way to go about this?\n\nA: You asked, \"What is the best way to go about this?\" and while I'll not make that determination, nonetheless, here's an example using the do shell script command and some command line utilities.\nset theRichTextFile to quoted form of \"/path/to/filename.rtf\"\nset theCharacterCount to do shell script \"textutil -stdout -convert txt \" & theRichTextFile & \" | LANG=en_US.UTF-8 wc -m | sed 's/ //g'\"\n\nNote that theRichTextFile must be a quoted POSIX pathname.\nUpdate: Per comment by @jackjr300, added LANG=en_US.UTF-8 to the command.\n", "Q: “Untitled” item on my MacBook Pro desktop I just installed macOS El Capitan, and now I see there is an Untitled item on the Desktop:\n\nThis item contains the following directories: \n\nI’ve never seen anything like this on the Desktop before. When I look through the Finder, I don’t see this item.\nWhat's the issue here?\n\nA: This is just your system hard drive. You didn’t provide a name when you formatted it, and so macOS gave it a default name of Untitled.\nYou can rename it by right-clicking it in the Finder sidebar under the heading Devices, or by opening Disk Utility and right-clicking it there. Then simply choose Rename.\nYou can also hide hard drives from your desktop by going into the menu bar Finder → Preferences → General and unchecking Hard disks under the heading Show these items on the desktop.\n", "Q: Copying Individual Photos from Messages in 10.12.6 I recently sent 7 photos to myself using iMessage from my iPhone so that I could have access to them on my Mac (it's faster than AirDrop for me). They appeared in Messages on my Mac, and I was able to double-click on them and look at them individually. \nHowever, when I tried to copy and paste any one of the 7 photos, either from the text or from their own (Quick Look) photo window, pasting would just paste all 7 photos, instead of the one I’d copied. \nI tried copying using shortcuts and menus. I tried pasting into Messages. And I tried simply pasting into a blank file. All those actions resulted in my only being able to copy and paste the 7 photos instead of the desired 1.\nI was able to drag-and-drop with a single photo, though this seems insufficient given how unpolished this feature seems to work within Messages and elsewhere.\nIf copying and pasting individual photos is possible, any info would be much appreciated!\n\nA: Click Details in the top-right corner of your conversation window (or right-click the conversation from the conversation list and click Details…).\nIn the media browser (under either Photos or Files), you are able to copy & paste or drag & drop individual items.\n", "Q: Does iTunes Sound Check Lower Sound Quality? I have found that many do not like the Sound Check feature in iTunes.\nWill enabling Sound Check lower sound quality?\nWhy does/does it not reduce sound quality?\n\nA: No, it is not bad to have sound check enabled in iTunes.\nHaving it enabled does not make the sound quality of songs worse.\nSound Check works simply by dynamically raising or lowering the playback volume, just as you yourself can raise and lower the playback volume in iTunes without affecting sound quality.\niTunes raises/lowers playback volume according to the audio normalisation ID3-tag within the audio file. These tags are created automatically when you rip a CD with iTunes, and automatically added when you import files lackings these tags into iTunes.\nThe normalisation tag simply tells what the average volume of the song is. Note that iTunes recognizes albums, so that when playing back and album, it will adjust according to the average track volume of the album as a whole, instead of changing the playback volume for each song individually. Therefore your album listening experience is not harmed.\niTunes automatically ensures that the volume is not raised so high that neither clipping occurs or compression effects are introduced. Therefore your sound quality is not harmed.\nAll in all this means that enabling Sound Check is safe, does not change the audio content of your songs, thus not reducing their quality. It simply change the playback volume slightly so that you get an pleasurable listening experience without having to tweak your playback volume every time you select a new album.\n\nA: I was experiencing distortion on both headphones and via airplay (when playing music from my iPhone). When investigating, I discovered that sound check was on. I turned it off and the distortion went away. The tracks where I noticed this were:\nField of Dreams, opening credits (track 1).\nStar Trek V, opening credits (track 1).\nNote: Both albums were ripped from CD using iTunes, 256 kbps AAC and played via iTunes Match. \n\nA: I hate this option, by default it was on and I was thinking why audio quality is that poor, after while I found that option and after I turned it off I have a better life since then!\n", "Q: How to add a disk to the Win10 on the Mac? I used Boot Camp to create a Win10 system on my Mac 2017.\n \nBut you see the C disk only 37.8G usable (40G), how can I divide a disk from the Mac to add a D disk to the Win10 system?\n\nA: Things to consider...\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you have sufficient spare drive space on your Mac drive?\n\n*Do you really need a separate partition or just a larger C partition?\n\n*The only Apple-supported way to change the size of a Boot Camp partition is to delete it then re-add from Boot Camp Assistant - not great if you need to preserve data on the Windows partition.\n\n*Disk Utility will not allow you to create more than 4 partitions on a drive, including hidden partitions. The Boot Camp partition was already the fourth.\n\n*Trying to change partitions in any way, shape or form from inside Windows will break your entire Mac/Win drive structure. \nThe only application I know of that can move, create, resize, backup partitions, including Boot Camp, without breaking anything is Paragon Hard Disk Manager\nMy recommendation would be to use it to increase the size of the C partition [thereby shrinking the Mac partition, assuming sufficient free space] rather than create another as a D partition.\n", "Q: How do I clone the local drives' Users directory ACL to an external drive? My local drive (Macintosh HD) runs out of space so I want to setup an external drive (External HD) with the same /Users directory and associated ACL as on the Macintosh HD drive and offload some of the more data-heavy directories there (Photos, Music, Movies).\nGet Info on the User directory of Macintosh HD shows these permissions:\n\nI've tried to use the [+] button (after authorising with admin privileges), but it didn't seem to allow me to add 'special' users. How do set 'system' to have R&W access, for instance?\nBefore making such a fundamental change, I wanted to see if I should use sudo chown -R system:system system to this directory. Though this would only change the owner and not necessarily let other users also have access to it. AFAIK, users 'system' and 'admin' are in different groups too.\nAlso, if I do a Get Info on a user I see this \"Fetching...\" line, which never seems to go away. What is this meant to fetch? A list of users who have access to this directory?\n\n\nA: Ok, so turns out that all I needed to do was sudo chown root:admin /Volumes/External_HD/Users\nObviously, the checkbox next to \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" should be un-ticked.

Hold Power and Home until the device reboots. If the device reboots back to the Connect to iTunes screen, then you will have to connect to iTunes and follow the instructions.\n", "Q: Is it possible to manually sync reminders with iCloud whenever you want? I regularly seem to have problems with my reminders not syncing in a timely manner. I am using the Reminders app on my iMac (OS X 10.11.6).\nIs there some way for me to manually sync my reminders with iCloud? \nI’m thinking something like the option to ‘get mail’ in the Mail app that you can click on to manually get your mail.\n\nA: Yes, but only by revealing the Debug menu in Reminders.

For the same app, I need to fix some bugs and release to the App Store again. What do I need to do with those development & distribution certificates?\nI think the private key is on that developer's laptop right? Do I have to have that private key in order to release an update for that app? \nCan I just revoke the development & distribution certificates created by that developer & create all those certificates & provisioning profiles again for the same app, then update the app in App Store? Or does an app update need the same distribution certificate created by the previous developer?\nAlso, for a new app, can I re-use the same certificates (development & distribution) but re-generate provisioning profiles with new app's bundle ID?\n\nA: Revoke the certificates of the old developer and start fresh with your own new certificates. \nYou must generate a new one if you want to be able to compile your app, to commit an update or submit an app from scratch.

This morning I tried to download an app off of the app store, and it asked me to verify the billing information for the master account. I am in college, and share downloads with my family. The app store wanted the security code for the card on the account. This was an old card, and my father switched cards this morning in the billing information. I have restarted the app store and my computer, but the old card number still appears in the billing verification window in an un-editable field. \n\nHe does not remember the old security code.

I'm in the process of trying to automate getting the LVGUUID and printing it as a string to a text file, or better piping it in terminal to other commands. All I can do right now is diskutil coreStorage list and then copy/paste the UUID as needed. Is there a faster way to do this?\n\nA: Note: This answer is just example code as I only have one Core Storage Volume to test against, however, if there's more then one, the awk command could be modified to accommodate accordingly. Although without the output of multiple Core Storage Volumes, I cannot give an example.\nIf it's the Logical Volume Group UUID, you can user the following example:\n$ lvguuid=\"$(diskutil coreStorage list | awk '/Logical Volume Group/{print $5}')\"\n$ echo \"$lvguuid\"\n696AD841-1F53-4D33-9496-3E36D33AB270\n$ \n\nIn the awk command, you can substitute Logical Volume Group with Physical Volume, Logical Volume Family and  change $5 as appropriate. Based on the order of the search string shown in this line, it will be $5, $4, $5.\nFor Logical Volume, you'll need to use a regex, as in the following example:\nlvuuid=\"$(diskutil coreStorage list | awk '/Logical Volume [A-F0-9]{8}-/{print $4}')\"\n\nUnderstanding the regex:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logical Volume [A-F0-9]{8}-\n\n\n*\n\n*Logical Volume matches the characters Logical Volume literally (case sensitive).\n\n\n*[A-F0-9]{8} - Match a single character present in the list below.\n\n\n*\n\n*{8} Quantifier — Matches exactly 8 times.\n\n*A-F a single character in the range between A (index 65) and F (index 70) (case sensitive).\n\n*0-9 a single character in the range between 0 (index 48) and 9 (index 57) (case sensitive).\n\n*- matches the character - literally (case sensitive).\n\n\n\nSo, in my example awk matches Logical Volume 38712F52- and returns:\n38712F52-5967-4A49-87D6-C66D4B199F28\n\n\nThe above examples set a variable that can be called from the command line or script, however, if you what the output to a file, then use the following example:\ndiskutil coreStorage list | awk '/Logical Volume Group/{print $5}' > /path/to/filename\n\n\nOn my system here's the output of the diskutil coreStorage list command on an encrypted USB Flash Drive:\n$ diskutil coreStorage list\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 696AD841-1F53-4D33-9496-3E36D33AB270\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         Encrypted\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         15661490176 B (15.7 GB)\n    Free Space:   16777216 B (16.8 MB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume E0E76F6B-A4E2-466D-B8E5-D5977ECD0522\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk3s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     15661490176 B (15.7 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family EAF4984B-94C8-49B6-BCC6-76A8724E04D2\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n        Encryption Type:         AES-XTS\n        Conversion Status:       Complete\n        Conversion Direction:    -none-\n        Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes\n        Fully Secure:            Yes\n        Passphrase Required:     Yes\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume 38712F52-5967-4A49-87D6-C66D4B199F28\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:               disk4\n            Status:             Online\n            Size (Total):       15325941760 B (15.3 GB)\n            Size (Converted):   -none-\n            Revertible:         Yes (unlock and decryption required)\n            LV Name:            Encrypted\n            Volume Name:        Encrypted\n            Content Hint:       Apple_HFS\n$ \n\n", "Q: How do I avoid re-entering administrator password when I try to remove apps with Finder? The fact that Finder asks for entering the password each time you try to remove an application makes very hard to cleanup your mac. It seems that it does not even remember the password for one minute.\nI am looking for a way to avoid this escalation prompt while still keeping it for some other activities.\nI am currently using High-Sierra but I am pretty sure that the solution could apply to Sierra or even Snow-leopard.\n\nA: Well, that only happens if you try to delete the App from Finder, which is not they best way in my opinion.\nIf you have downloaded them from the App Store you can go to the Launchpad and click and hold, kind of like deleting apps from iPhone, and apps will start shaking and a cross icon will apear on the top-left of apps that can be deleted that way.\nPersonally I use AppCleaner as this software also performs a search for other places where the app to delete may have stored data and gives you a preview for you to review and confirm deletion.\nI do some development and when I want to emulate first-time installation process/experience I use AppCleaner to delete any profile or history data stored outside the App Bundle.\nFinally, you can delete apps from Terminal App but I won't provide details as this is not recommended even if you know what you are doing :p.\n", "Q: How can playlists be preserved in iTunes? Steps to reproduce.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off importing of tracks to iTunes Library\n\n*Import Tracks\n\n*Create playlists\n\n*Change file names or move files\n\n*Have broken playlists\n\n\nI understand why this happens. It's because of the nature of linked files. Is there any way to have the playlists maintain integrity or fix them?  It seems even when I use iCloud music the playists are \"brittle\" and can easily break.\n\nA: The best way to preserve your playlists is to manage them, as far as possible, within iTunes.\nIt seems to me from your question and comment that the biggest issue arises when you rename a file you've previously added to a playlist. However, instead of renaming the file within your operating system, you should do it within iTunes. One way to do this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within iTunes right-click on the song\n\n*From the context menu that appears, select Get Info (or Info)\n\n*This brings up all of the metadata for the song, including the field for its name\n\n*Rename the song\n\n*Click OK\nManaging all of this via iTunes will ensure you don't break your playlists.\nAlso, you may want to check your advanced settings within iTunes and play with the Keep iTunes Media folder organized and Copy files to the iTunes Media folder when adding to library options to determine what works best for you.\n", "Q: Is there a way to re-purpose an iMac as a second monitor while using components? I have a late 2009 iMac 21.5\". I am buying a new iMac and want the old one to be put to use. Is there a way to make it a 2nd monitor? What can become of the old components inside the 2009 iMac? The hard drive (replaced by Apple) is only 2.5 years old - can that somehow be used? Thanks for any suggestions. \n\nA: Unfortunately the 21.5\" late 2009 iMac model cannot be used as a display via Target Display Mode, although the 27\" model could.\nIt's not clear what state your old iMac is in (working order or not), but if it boots then you can use it for a number of purposes (e.g. as a file and/or print server, for sharing a VPN connection, for sharing an iTunes library, etc).\nIf you really wanted to take advantage of its screen, you may have some limited success with a software solution. For example, people use Air Display to use existing iMacs as monitors for other devices/computers. However, this and other software solutions can be a little hit and miss.\nAnother option is to use your old iMac in Target Disk Mode. This is effectively a way of turning your iMac into an external hard drive. For more information on this you can read Use target disk mode to share files between two Mac computers.\nFinally, if your old iMac is not in working order, you can sell some of its parts online (e.g. via eBay). If this is your scenario, you may want to consider keeping the hard drive and using it in an external case as an external hard drive for your new iMac. Whether this is worth doing will depend on its size etc.\n", "Q: How to search for pictures of two people in iPhoto? iPhoto has the ability to recognize faces.

Every time it is disconnected improperly it hangs a long time upon trying to remount it because the system keeps checking the fs:\n$ sudo lsof | grep disk2\nfsck_msdo 2084             root    3u      CHR               1,6 0xcf04928000     1153 /dev/rdisk2s1\n\nTried force mounting, unmounting, eject, OS restarting, killing fs_check process, but every time it restarts the filesystem check.\nIs it necessary? How can I disable it?\n$ diskutil list\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2\n   1:             Windows_FAT_32 Transcend               1.0 TB     disk2s1\n\n\nA: It is necessary. \nIt is independent of Mac or macOS involved. As you wrote \"improperly\": this is the key here.\nTo prevent damage from the filesystem the OS checks \"is the filesystem dirty?\", i.e. not cleanly unmounted. \"Dirty\" filesystems then get a run of filesystem check (fsck_msdos). Successful fsck marks the filesystem as clean. (And usually tries to correct some inconsistencies, if it finds some of those it could rectify.)\nKilling that process before it does the same as a proper unmount, i.e. \"marking the filesystem as clean\", will send you into a loop. Finding a way around that may be possible, but is certainly not recommendable.\nTwo 'solutions': \n\n\n*\n\n*Try to eject/unmount the filesystem cleanly every time. That is the best way to avoid the fsck run. There may be some applications available to make even that even more convenient, depending on what kind of disks on what type of connection they are to be used.\n\n*Let it run its fsck course the first time around. That is the shortest way to start using it again.\n\n\nPossible Preventive Measures:\nMechanical unplugging the drives involuntarily while awake or in use could be mitigated with a better cable. No joke. I have one quite expensive cable that sits much tighter than all the others in that port. \nIf the problem occurs mainly with sleeping or after not using the external drive you might want to look into an app like Mountain. It's commercial and there might be others out there (Jettison, CleanMyDrive). \nAlso, true: this fsck_msdos is mainly to notify you of any and prevent further damage, so you can take it to a system whose fsck or chkdsk actually can repair it.\n", "Q: Is screen sharing under Sierra secure, i.e., a fully encrypted connection? I'm trying to figure out if the screen sharing data is encrypted when I connect to my Mac at home from another Mac at work. I've seen a lot of questions and answers but I can't really find a definitive answer. Basically, I just have my Mac sitting at home with Screen Sharing turned on and I'm port-forwarding 5900. It works but again, I'd like it to be secure. \nNow, before anyone mentions SSH tunneling, I had it set up the first day I tried this (Remote Login, port-forwarded 22, tunnel created, etc) but then it stopped working. I'm still trying to figure out what's going on there but if Screen Sharing is completely encrypted, then I'm not going to worry about the tunnel anymore. \n\nA: The answer depends on how you connect to it. \nIf you're using a standard VNC client to connect with a password only, nothing is encrypted. Not even the password.\nIf you're using the Screen Sharing app on macOS 10.8 (Mountain Lion) or later to connect with a username/password or AppleID, everything is encrypted.\nIf you're using the Screen Sharing app on macOS 10.7 (Lion) or earlier to connect with a username/password, the exchange of credentials as well as keypresses and mouse moves are encrypted by default. However the actual screen display (i.e. the graphical content) is not. You can enable full encryption from the Preferences menu in the Screen Sharing app.\nIf you're using VNC, I would recommend wrapping it in encryption using for example an SSH tunnel, encrypted VPN or similar measures.\n", "Q: Set pagezoom of Safari programmatically I recently bought a 4K monitor and love the screen real estate. But the standard fonts are becoming a bit too small to read. So I plan on writing a script in Keyboard Maestro to change the default PageZoom in Safari to 125% when I press a button.\nI have figured out that I can set the pagezoom with this command in the Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari DefaultPageZoom  \"1.25\"\n\nThis works because defaults read com.apple.Safari DefaultPageZoom reports the set value back. AND the Safari preferences also show the value set.\nBut page in Safari doesn't change. However, when I change the PageZoom in the Preferences manually the page DOES change.\nI've tried reloading the page and changing the window size after setting the PageZoom in the Terminal, but nothing works.\nWhat do I need to do to make the defaults write setting become active?\nI don't want to use the CMD+ and CMD- keys all the time.\nIn the end I want Keyboard Maestro to trigger this script when I plug in a device that signals I'm using this monitor.\n\nA: You need to\n\n\n*\n\n*close Safari\n\n*run the Terminal command\n\n*re-open Safari\n\n\nMost (if not all) defaults write commands require you to quit or kill the affected application or process to see the results.\n\nTo solve your problem you may think about setting the display resolution from 3840 x 2160 to 1920 x 1080 (Retina / HDPI). This will increase the size of all display elements including text in Safari.\nGo to System Preferences > Display and change the resolution there.\n\nA: From the answers given above and the link I found to Enable Safari Zoom by Script\nthere are several possibilities:\nShell script\n# set pagezoom to 125%\nkillall Safari\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari DefaultPageZoom \"1.25\"\nopen -a Safari\n\nI added this to a Keyboard Maestro macro that is started by a keyboard shortcut trigger (for now).\n# revert pagezoom to 100%\nkillall Safari\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari DefaultPageZoom 1\nopen -a Safari\n\nI added this to another Keyboard Maestro macro that is started by a keyboard shortcut trigger (for now).\nThis works great but the downside is that Safari needs to be restarted. \nApple script\n\n-- set pagezoom to 125%\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Safari\"\n        set frontmost to true\n        keystroke \",\" using command down\n        delay 0.5\n        tell window 1\n            click button \"Advanced\" of toolbar 1 of it\n            click pop up button 3 of group 1 of group 1 of it\n            click menu item 6 of menu 1 of pop up button 3 of group 1 of group 1 of it\n            keystroke \"w\" using command down\n        end tell\n    end tell\n  end tell\n\nor revert back to 100%\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Safari\"\n        set frontmost to true\n        keystroke \",\" using command down\n        delay 0.5\n        tell window 1\n            click button \"Advanced\" of toolbar 1 of it\n            click pop up button 3 of group 1 of group 1 of it\n            click menu item 4 of menu 1 of pop up button 3 of group 1 of group 1 of it\n            keystroke \"w\" using command down\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThis changes the page without restarting Safari. But from a Keyboard Maestro macro it doesn't work consistently.\nTinkertool\nTinkertool not only offers the ability to set the pagezoom for Safari, but also to set the default system fontsize. Caveat: change only takes effect after relaunching applications and Tinkertool is not scriptable so it requires manual intervention.\nConclusion\nFor now I'll stick with the Keyboard Maestro macros running the Apple scripts. When my big monitor is connected, the Logitech webcam is also connected so I added an extra trigger to the macros:\nUSB Device with Name Containing 'Webcam' is Attached to increase the pagezoom and \nUSB Device with Name Containing 'Webcam' is Detached to revert the pagezoom to 100%.\nThis allows me to automatically switch the pagezoom when connecting or disconnecting the big screen.\n", "Q: Messages on MacBook isn't sending or receiving messages, despite being signed in to iCloud My iPhone is connected to iCloud with the same account. In Messages → Preferences, under \"You can be reached for Messages at:\" my iPhone's number and my iCloud account are both there and checked.\nI have tried restarting Messages, my MacBook, as well as turning iMessage off and on from my phone, and removing the files from ~/Library/Messages. Nothing so far has worked.\nMy computer is running El Capitan, and other applications (such as Notes) can sync over iCloud just fine.\n\nA: The first step would be to make sure you can send iMessages to other iCloud users. If not, then you’ll want to Sign Out of iCloud under Messages → Preferences → Accounts. You may need to reboot your MacBook before signing back in.\nIf it’s regular text messages (SMS/MMS) that aren’t working, on your iPhone open Settings → Messages → Text Message Forwarding and make sure your MacBook is enabled. If it already is, toggle it off, then back on.

However, here I don't mind too much)\n\nA: It is indeed challenging to get that functionality to work reliable, since iOS has a very conservative power saving mechanism and developers are not making things up.\nThe problem is: While there actually is a way for Apps to use Bluetooth LE while in the Background, it's very limitated. Typically, to connect to a BLE device like Noke, the App needs to scan on for the device which advertises is presence. Only after a scan is received, the app can actually connect to the device. A device issues a scan using iOS system services and registers a callback, which means the OS \"calls\"/\"activates\" the app if a device that was scanned for is found.\nWhen scanning for a device, there are several parameters that can be tuned that affect power intensity but also latency when interacting with BLE. In gerneal, you need to balance these parameters for the best experience. In foreground, scanning for and connecting to devices is very quick on iOS, but in background, iOS ignores some options developers can configure but foremost, it reduces the frequency of the scan which greatly reduces the power usage, but also introduces a lot of latency. iOS also decides when to issue the callback to the app described above.\nI made the discovery that power saving on iOS 11.1 is way more aggressive then on iOS 10. Are or where you using iOS 11 when those problems occured?\nSource: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/CoreBluetooth_concepts/CoreBluetoothBackgroundProcessingForIOSApps/PerformingTasksWhileYourAppIsInTheBackground.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013257-CH7-SW1\n", "Q: Debugging Apple Watch Wifi Apple Watch should connect automatically to any network I was previously connected with on my iPhone.\nAt my university I need to register devices for network access by providing them with a MAC address.

I have files on my hard drive that I would rather not back up to the cloud.  I'm just fine using external disk drives the old fashioned way.\nSo when I upgraded to Sierra recently, it initialized iCloud as part of the new system init.  No opt-out choice which irritated me.  (Edit: When I unchecked the two boxes on the iCloud screen the Continue button became unclickable.  Apparently this is unique to me and not normal experience.)\nAs soon as I logged in to the new system I went straight to the iCloud config in system preferences to disable it.  When I disabled the backup drive it prompted me with choices what to do with all my files: never mind keep backup drive on, \"keep local copy\" and \"delete on mac\".  And \"delete on mac\" was the suggested / default!\nHorrified, I chose to \"keep local copy\" and once that was done, frantically looked in all the folders I could think of to ensure that my files were still there.  It appears they are.\nNow my question is, did I get \"doxed\" in this process?  Did the machine just start uploading all my files into Apple's cloud until I turned off iCloud backup drive?  (Or, dare I say, afterwards?)\n\nA: During Sierra setup assistant, a whole page is dedicated to whether you would like Documents and Desktop in iCloud Drive. You are specifically given a choice whether you would like to use this feature and can choose to not turn it on. As such I completely disagree that there was 'no opt-out'.\n\nSince you enabled this feature, macOS will immediately begin uploading the contents of your Documents and Desktop folders to iCloud Drive. When you proceed to disable this, the Keep Local Copy option will ensure the documents remain on your computer. Delete on Mac is the default as that makes more sense for those who use this feature on purpose.\nDoxing has a very specific meaning. Regardless of whether you meant to turn this feature on, your data were never published, therefore this cannot be doxing.\n", "Q: Minimize buttons are disabled when I connect an external monitor Whenever I connect an external monitor all the minimize buttons on existing apps get disabled (they are gray).

I've just bought a Dell Ultrasharp U2715H display to connect to my 13 inch mid 2012 MBP. I just need it as a bigger monitor for word docs and web sites. I might later upgrade to the latest 13 inch MBP but for now I've no idea how to set up the monitor. \nI've bought a mini displayport male to HDMI female 4kx2k adapter to use with an HDMI cable but it's not working very well (nothing usable). My MBP is running OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 and the graphics card looks to be Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536MD. I've 4GB of memory installed. \nI've hunted around and tried to google a route through this but I'm not technical enough. I just want the cheapest, easiest way to get this monitor up and running. \nHow can I connect my 13\" MacBook Pro (mid 2012) to my Dell U2715H display?\n\nA: Try using an HDMI to HDMI cable (or other) to check that the combination cable you are using isn't broken in some way.\nI have a new (mid-2017) MacBook Pro 13\" with touchbar and found that certain combinations just don't work when I connect to the same version Dell monitor. For example I bought a USB C to HDMI cable link here, and it will not work. I'm not technical either but believe it or not, there are different USB C settings! The website now says their new cable doesn't work with MacBook 2017 models, after I informed them. They said that they will now produce one that will.\nTherefore, if changing the cable  (borrow one from a friend for an hour) doesn't cure your problem then you may be experiencing similar issues to mine.\nAdditionally, you now have information to avoid my mistake if you buy a new MBP and use your Dell monitor :-) \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Mac Pro 5.1 Windows 10 EFI Boot (Separate Drive) I've installed Windows 10 EFI with this Tutorial and it worked fine. But when switching from Windows to OSX using the Bootcamp \"Boot to OSX...\" it just rebooted into Windows again. Then I unplugged the Windows drive and it booted into OSX, but now if I choose \"Windows\" from System Preferences->Startup Disk it just reboots to OSX.\nIs the only way of switching OS in this configuration by using a helper card and pressing alt on boot?\nMy current setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Pro 4.1 (flashed to 5.1) \n\n*2,66 Quad Xeon\n\n*RX480 graphics card\n\n*Bay 1 OSX SSD Drive\n\n*2nd Optical Bay Windows SSD Drive\n\n\n\n\nA: I have installed it on 2 separate drives. Windows being in EFI mode, and during the installation I did not use any Boot Camp crap, but I had to leave only 1 empty drive for Windows 10 install and boot from Windows 10 DVD in EFI mode. Then I created the Windows partition from scratch and installed Windows.\nDownload the bootcamp drivers from this link. I did update Windows and installed Boot Camp 6 drivers by running msiexec /i BootCamp64.msi from Administrative CMD window, which is located in Boot Camp\\Drivers\\Apple directory. Then I connected all the other drives.\nIn macOS High Sierra I installed Boot Runner from Twocanoes. From the recovery partition's terminal I executed:\ncsrutil enable --without nvram\nso the Boot runner can boot Windows. After logging back into macOS High Sierra, logout. You will come to the Boot runner's startup disk screen. Select Windows and it will reboot to Windows. If you want to go back to macOS, select macOS High Sierra option in the startup disk of the Boot Camp manager (in Windows)\nI have migrated my internal Windows drive to Sonnet Tempo SSD Pro Plus SATA III PCI Express Card. Unfortunately, due to the fact the drives on this card are recognized as external, I guess Boot Runner does not populate an option to boot directly from this drive. As a workaround though I can select the SSD as a boot drive from the Boot Camp manager in my internal Windows drive which works like a charm.\n\nA: i pretty much have the exact same problem with similar configuration. \nWindows 10 is working fine but \"set startup disk\" in system preferences seams to not work… In System Preferences under startup disk it shows up my windows 10 folder correctly but it doesn't work when selected and restart – it boots just in Mac OS again.\nwhen i boot with holding option(alt) (Mac startup manager) to select the startup disk it shows up \"EFI Boot\" instead of \"Windows\" but works actually fine when boot into \"EFI Boot\" (which is my Win10 install).\nMy guess is (when you look at diskutil list) that the EFI Partition should be in position 1 instead 2 (should be disk3s1 instead of disk3s2)  to work correctly – Windows Recovery is set on disk3s1 falsely.\nBecause i use a unflashed GTX 1070 GPU with Nvidia web drivers i'm not able to navigate to the startup manager holding option(alt). For that reason i use bootchamp now to boot in to windows manually. only downside of this method is that i have to boot into mac OS first every time and when restarting the computer from windows it boots up in mac OS again because Bootchamp only sets the startup disk to windows for once.\n(But this isn't actually a problem for me because i use Mac OS more)\ni hope you could find any solution already or i could help you a little bit with your/our problem\nRegards\n", "Q: Macbook Pro (late 2011 15\") is stuck in a boot loop It boots up until the progress bar is at about 80%, then it flashes to an empty grey screen, no login window shown, no Apple logo. 30 seconds later it reboots on its own. \nThings I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*reset the PRAM/NVRAM\n\n*reset SMC \n\n*booted with d+shift: no indication of any kind of different boot, same as normal boot\n\n*booted with cmd+r: it doesn't boot to the recovery window, but switches to \"Internet Recovery\".

Does this mean it has a dead GPU? I just found out that Apple's repair program ended in December 2016... \n\nA: \nDoes this mean it has a dead GPU?\n\nYes. Absolutely. This means it is one of thousands GPUs killed by inadequate thermal design that finally bit the bullet. As all MBPs from that era are defective by design it is impossible to keep them around for the amount of time you would expect from a quality product.\nIf this machine is still around then it can be partially resurrected with a procedure like this:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/295805/251859\nThis bypasses the AMD GPU through a forced EFI variable. No amount of SMC reset voodoo or the like will restore a GPU dead MBP.\nYou might want to bake the chip for a flaky temporary fix like with the iBake procedure.\nThe only real fix though is to either sue Apple like they deserve for lying on this to us all or to replace only the AMD chip in question. That is way cheaper than to go the now defunct Apple road of replacing a faulty board with another faulty board.\nConverting it over into a Linux machine makes the GPU bypass on a defective machine easier, but will not do much good for keeping it around long enough.\n\nA: You can try this:\n1. Remove hard drive.\n2. Backup all data from it (external case will help) to another computer.\n3. Format your HD.\n4. Try to install and boot a fresh (factory like) MacOS.\nPS: it is also an option to install a HD from a working MacBook, if you have access to one. \nIf that fails, you definitely have a hardware problem. \n\nA: You model is known to have a faulty video logic board, and Apple even has a repair program for them.\nBefore going the Apple Store route, you can try one more thing, which , if it fails, proves that there is something gravely wrong with the hardware (something you probably already suspect). You can connect a FireWire/Thunderbolt cable between yours and a working Mac, and use Target Boot mode to see if it boots properly. You can find more detailed instructions here but it pretty much entails booting your MacBook while pressing the 'T' key.\n\nA: In case anyone else ends up here with boot loop issues with a 2011 MBP or similar years. This is not the GPU fault as other answers have suggested.\nFrom all my research this is most likely a new battery needed. I am replacing mine this week and will report back.\nI have MBP 2011 and I had the GPU card fault. It doesn’t boot loop from this. It just causes screen issues. Mine was fixed when Apple finally caved in and offered repairs for the dodgy GPU.\nAs the original poster suggested I also tried all the fixes and it is impossible to even boot from a recovery drive of any sort. You get to Apple logo. Progress bar starts. Then you reboot or screen goes grey or black then reboot or shutdown. You won’t even get through to safe mode etc.\nA few YouTube tech videos spotted it being a battery problem.\nIt seems non-sensical as power is getting to your laptop and starting it up. But something about the battery prevents it fully booting.\nI wouldn’t put it past Apple to have made this intentional. But there is no reason a degraded battery should cause this.\nOn a separate note. Yes it’s an old MBP but these old ones are absolute workhorses and the last of the upgradable MBPs. Apple ruined the MBP line by preventing RAM and battery upgrades. They essentially realised the older MBPs lasted so long they’d shot themselves in the feet. And now with new MBPs they’re shooting us original Apple fans in the back with hyper expensive products with limited shelf lives.\n", "Q: How to backup a locked iPhone? I have a iPhone SE running iOS 10.2. It happened so that now I can't use it but computer reads it normally but asks to enter password. Is there any any way to backup it via 3rd party software or something so that I could do a iCloud erase and stay on 10.2 (which is important). Or maybe there's a way to enter or remove password from a computer?\nRestoring is not a option. Updating to 10.3.2 and saving data is risky, because downgrading to 10.2 is risky and iPhone may not accept a backup from a newer iOS version. \n\nA: If you've lost the password/passcode to a locked iPhone, you have very few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have access to iCloud, remote wipe it from there\n\n*Put the device in recovery or DFU mode and reinstall your preferred version of the iOS.\n\n\nObviously you'll lose all the data on the device -- without access to the device you can't authorise iTunes to access the contents to bake a backup, for example - and you're limited to the version of iOS that Apple is still currently signing (they typically stop signing older versions a few weeks after a new version is deployed)\nSadly, you're quite stuck, and apart from the above, or a visit to your local Apple distributor, there isn't much you can do.\nIf, however, your phone is stuck in a boot loop, you can try one of the few \"hail Mary\" options which have saved my bacon more than once. There's a tool called Recboot which will try to put your phone into recovery mode (or you can try to octopus-like method yourself), or (and this is the life-saving bit) get you out of recover mode.\nI don't personally own the software, but have used it to get out of a few jams in the past.

Is there a way to do it batch?\n\nA: Your question isn't quite clear, so I'm making some assumptions here:\n - You're using a Mac, with iTunes.\n - You're either looking for a way to distinguish your own music from Apple Music for whatever reason (having non-DRMd versions of the songs in your own personal library)\nI can't help you with the last part, but iTunes on the Mac (and I suppose Windows) stores Apple Music (extension m4p) files separately from Your music files (extension m4a, mp3, aac, etc)\nApple Stores Apple Music under the iTunes Library folder (which you can discover by going to the iTunes Preferences pane and looking at the last tab). Apple Music is typically stored under /iTunes Media/Apple Music whereas your music is stored under /iTunes Media/Music\nOr you can execute a command like the following from the iTunes library folder that will list all the Apple Music files into a text document.\nfind . -name \"*.m4p\" -print > textfile.txt\n\n", "Q: Touch ID not working after replacement of display unit of iPhone My screen was broken and Apple repair is pretty expensive (in Germany) so I chose to replace the display with one of the display units sold in the internet (GIGA Fixoo).

What to do?\n\nA: I read a lot of rumors in the internet. I read stories about people that spent several hundreds of euros for this. People keep telling that its hopeless and only Apple could fix this. In fact theres so much disinformation that I decided to write here in the hope to reach more frustrated users. Further there is common confusion with the \"Error 53\" when changing the home button. I dare to say that the cause of most of the nonfunctional buttons out there is the following:\nThe connector for the homebutton is floating. The short flex cable of the male connector below makes is hard to use directed force to plug the connector in. Since you don't want to damage anything you will just softly push it until it sticks. Therefore there is a high chance it is not connected correctly. I recommend using something as a pad below the connectors, e.g. the plastic scoop delivered with most of the display sets, to apply a counter force from below. This way the flex cable won't be damaged and the connector can be plugged in correctly. \n", "Q: Is there any way to lock the Lock/Unlock settings?

There doesn't seem to be a way to do this is the Restrictions or anything, and I can't find anything on how to do this.\n\nA: No, unfortunately there is no way to lock this particular setting. \nThis is similar to how it isn't possible to lock the auto lock setting on iPhones – if someone has access to the device in an unlocked state, that person can change the auto lock duration freely from the settings app.\nHowever, you can use a device management profile from something like SimpleMDM.

I am using Apple's Photos app on macOS El Capitan.\nWhen trying to copy my Photos Library.photoslibrary file (44 gigs) from old external drive to new internal drive, I get a -36 error. Apparently the file is corrupt. \nAre all my photos lost? Are those photos stored externally as files somewhere else on the disk? \n\nA: In Finder, right-click the Photos Library.photoslibrary file and click Show Package Contents. Inside you will find a folder named Masters. It contains all your originals, organized by date. If you’ve made no edits to your photos, then that’s all you need.\nIf copying Masters fails, you can try copying individual subfolders until you’ve isolated the corrupted folders/photos. This will at least allow you to salvage the vast majority of your photos, instead of losing the entire library.\nThe -36 error in Finder is often caused by corrupt . files (typically .DS_Store). Thankfully there is a handy command-line utility named dot_clean that will attempt to fix this issue for you. It’s a good idea to have a backup of your photos before using any repair tool, so do this after you’ve copied your Masters folder somewhere safe.\nOpen a Terminal session and type the following:\ndot_clean ~/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary/\nThis is assuming your Photos Library is in the default location. Since you’re using an external drive, replace ~/Pictures with the correct path (prefixing spaces with \\).\nNow try copying your Photos Library.photoslibrary file once again. If this still fails, try repairing your external drive using Disk Utility and running First Aid on it.\nAnd as a last resort, you can try repairing your Photos Library.

I still want to make iPhone and FaceTime calls from my Mac.\nFaceTime is ridiculously aggressive about incoming calls: It will not only steal your mouse and keyboard focus and tab you out of fullscreen programs, it will also lower your entire system volume and pause your music. This sucks because I get about 4 spam phone calls per day. I don't mind answering legitimate calls on my iPhone.\nThe focus-stealing problem is the biggest, and I'd settle just with fixing that. I've seen a question about that asked on Reddit but with no answer.\n\nA: Have you tried disabling notifications? Or at least turning them down?\nUnder  → System Preferences → Notifications → FaceTime, uncheck Play sound for notifications, then change the Alert Style to Banners. Banners shouldn’t steal focus.\n\nYou could also enable Do Not Disturb while in fullscreen by ⌥ opt-clicking the Notification Center icon at the far right of your system menu bar.

I can't find the exception'ed certificate anywhere to delete or change it's permissions.  I've also chosen to show invisble items and expired items in the keychain and closed/reopened Safari.\nPersonally I think the browser itself should include an option to revoke the exception instead of jumping through the OS, if it makes it so easy to set it, it should be just as easy to remove it from the same place like other modern browsers allow for.\nBack story: I visited a website I recently created and added the Cloudflare Universal Edge certificate however my domain is actually serving up my server's CloudFlare Origin certificate which is untrusted and should only be used for traffic between my server and Cloudflare.  I know this is NOT an OSx or Safari issue however...\nIn Safari, I accepted the exception because 1) I know my website is completely safe and 2) I needed to access it right away while CF helps me figure out the problem is of the wrong cert being provided.\nHowever I need to remove this exception so I can test my site's SSL properly ensuring it's fixed.  I'm forced to use another machine.\nThe problem is the recently added exception is not listed anywhere in keychain access.  So what do I do?  I'm a web developer and if this is giving me this much headache how does Apple expect non technical folks to handle this?\n\nA: At least on my Catalina machine, I've found that the bypassed-invalid-cert-warning list is kept in:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Safari/BypassedInvalidCertificateWarning.plist\n\nModifying or deleting that file (and, as needed, emptying Safari's caches) is sufficient to get the invalid cert warning back again.\n\nA: I had this issue come up recently when traveling out of town, and having issues connecting to hotel WiFi, and in doing so did some IP sniffing, and trying to get onto a site via IP, which had a certificate mismatch, which I first added an exception to.\nTo get to the bottom of it, I first got info from the certificate in the browser, but nothing turned up in Keychain access looking for that. What I did to fix this was click on the lock icon in the URL bar, then clicked on Show Certificate. In that window, go to Trust > When using this certificate, and click on the ? icon to the right of the settings, which brings up a Mac Help window, which if you click on the link Open Keychain Access for me, where you can see the certificate highlighted in the Keychain Access listing. Tap the info button on the bottom of the screen, and from that window click to expand Trust, then change When using this certificate to Use System Defaults.

I am using Safari on macOS Sierra. I have added several commonly-used sites to my favorites section, like so:\n\n(there are 10 icons, and all but 2 of them are displayed as the proper, correct icon from the site. For example, the Wikipedia icon has the large W icon. However, for Google Drive and Gmail, the icons are just big, ugly, generic G's)\nI would like for the two Google sites to correctly display their icons as well. At first, I thought it was because all 8 of the \"correctly displayed\" sites had successfully configured their \"Safari settings\" or something like that, while Google failed to do this (although this doesn't sound too plausible).\nHowever, if I instead go to the top menu in Safari, click Bookmarks > Show Bookmarks, I get the following:\n\nStrangely, this time, the two Google sites do have correctly displayed icons, while it is instead three other sites (out of the 10) that aren't displayed: namely Wikipedia, Amazon, and New York Times.\nSo it seems that there are two sets of icons, \"big\" and \"small\", and for big icons, Google Drive and Gmail are not displayed correctly, while the other 8 are, and on the other hand, for small icons, Google Drive and Gmail are displayed correctly, while Wikipedia, Amazon, and NYTimes are not.\nI actually don't care too much about the small icons, but I would really like for all the big icons to display correctly. How can I do that?\n\nA: Here's a hack that works very nicely (it takes a moderate amount of simple image manipulation though. Also, see a note at the very bottom of this answer in order not to completely lose this fix and have to redo it). it seems that the issue is that the the icons given by the websites were designed for the bookmark bar, which has smaller icons, and not the safari favorites screen, which has larger icons (at least 144 x 144). Update: certain newer versions of Mac OS which come with Safari 15, such as Monterey and potentially Big Sur, use an icon size of 128 x 128.\nThe icons themselves are stored in ~/Library/Safari/Touch Icons Cache/Images/, with very long names (something like \"908F6BBF6DA814ABAF917C4E7BB9E36F.png\"). When a new Favorite is added (say New York Times, in the case of the original question), and the icon correctly displays in the Favorites screen, then a 144 x 144 png file appears in the aforementioned Cache folder, and everything's good and spiffy. However, if, say Gmail is added, and a big ugly, non-descript G appears instead of the nice Gmail icon, then that means a tiny png (designed for a bookmark bar instead of favorite screen) appeared in the Cache folder. (alternatively, if not even an incorrect tiny png appears in that folder, simply favorite another \"decoy\" site that does make a png file appear, perform the following, and then modify the Name and URL of the favorite later).\nSo in order to correct the icon, simply create another png that has the correct 144 x 144 resolution (see note below), then use that created png to replace the tiny \"incorrect\" file in the Touch Icons Cache folder, making sure to keep the long filename constant. Exit out of Safari (Command-Q) and restart, and the icon appears perfectly, as so:\n\nNote that Gmail and Google Drive now have the correct icons. I had to do the same thing for The Economist as well, since that site also did not provide a proper 144 x 144 favicon.\nFor a very simple way of creating a 144 x 144 icon using just Preview, simply download a high-res image of the icon (Gmail, Google Drive), or whatever, open in preview, then tools->adjust size to 144 width. Now put this image aside and call it \"image A\". Note that transparency sometimes causes trouble for safari favicons (e.g. if a region of a picture is colorless, the color actually displayed in those regions might be inconsistent). If this happens, we can make a white background. To do this, simply do command-shift-4 and drag a rectangular portion of any white portion of the screen, then take the resulting screenshot and resize to 144 x 144. Finally, take \"image A\" from before, and copy and paste onto this white space. This usually creates a very nice icon.\nImportant note: If you happen to have the \"Developer\" menu item (e.g. at the very top of the screen, near \"Bookmarks\" and \"Window\") enabled in Safari preferences, make sure not to select \"Clear Caches\", or else this will delete all the icons you made too. Also, simply Clearing History does the same thing. Alternatively, if you really want to clear history or clear cache for more disk space, save the custom icons you created before you clear; that way you can put them back afterwards without having to create them again.\nCaches can also be automatically cleared at times, so it is a good practice to create backups of icons.\nUpdate: If you do not anticipate adding or removing websites to your Favorites list very often, you can lock the Images folder (~/Library/Safari/Touch Icons Cache/Images) to prevent your computer from overwriting or deleting the icons you just added. Right-click the folder, select Get Info, and then check the Locked button. Your Favorites icons should now be resistant to random overwrites by the system. Note that if you clear some history, you may notice that some icons seem to have disappeared: in this case, just Quit the Safari app (fully Quit the app – don't just close the windows) and your icons should be back to normal once you re-open Safari (as long as you locked the Images folder before clearing the history). In the future when you want to add another website to your Favorites list, you will want to unlock the Images folder before adding the website as a favorite. Then, after following the above steps to ensure the icon is to your liking, before Quitting the Safari app, re-lock the Images folder. Finally, as a precaution, I would recommend that you add a copy of the new icon to your backup.\n\nA: #!/bin/zsh\n# Fix Safari Favorites Icons\n\nCS=\"cache_settings\"; TIC=\"Touch Icons Cache\"; DIR=\"$HOME/Library/Safari/$TIC/Images\"\nDB=\"$DIR/../${${TIC// }%%s*}${${(C)CS}//_}.db\"; SQL=$(sqlite3 \"$DB\" \"SELECT host FROM $CS\")\nsqlite3 \"$DB\" \"UPDATE $CS SET ${${${(L)TIC// /_}#*_}//s/_is_in}=1, download_status_flags=1\"\nfor png in \"$1\"/*.png; do URL=\"$(plutil -convert xml1 -o - \"$DIR/../../Bookmarks.plist\" | \\\nawk -F '[</>]' -v name=\"${${png##*/}%%.*}\" '$3~name{getline;getline;getline;print $5}')\"; \\\ncp -f -v \"$png\" \"$DIR/${(U)$(md5 -q -s $URL)}.png\"; done; chflags -v uappnd $DIR $DB\n\nFrom here: https://gist.github.com/dardo82/f7cc7c5c864fb5afa04bb12ecbcf3a9f\nThe script takes a folder with the missing touch icons as its only argument.\nEach favicon needs to have the same name as the bookmark associated with it.\nThe newly updated gist works with Safari 13 but now if you clear the browser cache the added favicons disappear in the new tab and reappear upon restart! \n\nA: A long-term fix would be to contact your website's publisher to add the correct icons appropriately.\nFor example, I own a website on Wix, and it's just a matter of adding a few lines of Header Code with links to my icon's image, then the site icon appears to work as expected.

When I turn it on, it says, \"iPhone is disabled\" and \"connect to iTunes.\"\nWhen I do so, iTunes reports that it is locked with a passcode, and that I need to type that in to continue. However, the iPhone does not display a keypad or allow any sort of input.\nApple suggests the only solution is a wipe, but this will lose all of her photos.\nCan photos be retrieved (at a minimum) from a disabled iPhone 4?\n\nA: This happens when the wrong passcode has been entered 10 times. The stages escalate from a 1-minute lock after 5 incorrect attempts, to a 60-minute lock after 9 incorrect attempts. After the 10th incorrect attempt, depending on the setting under Settings → Passcode, either the iPhone gets wiped, or you get the message you describe.\nSince your friend is worried about losing all her photos with a wipe, it's safe to assume she did not have iCloud Backup enabled, or that she was running iOS 4? Because if she does have a backup in iCloud, you could simply wipe the phone and restore it.\nAccording to OS X Daily, you need to plug the phone into iTunes on the computer it was previously synced with. Then you should be able to Sync it by entering the correct passcode directly into iTunes. This will trigger a new backup, after which you'll be able to Restore her iPhone from this backup.\nIf this doesn't work for you, then the only way to regain access to that iPhone is to wipe it. Because the contents of the phone are encrypted, not even Apple can recover the data for you.\n\nA: No. Unless you can wait the timeout and somehow enter the correct passcode, you would need to open the device and physically bypass or short circuit the protection in some way. \nThis brute force stack could succeed faster than the hundred hours if you are sure the erase after 10 wrong entries isn’t enabled. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://blog.mdsec.co.uk/2015/03/bruteforcing-ios-screenlock.html\nFor most people, erasing it eventually is the only practical option. \n\nA: Try to remove the passcode by restoring the iPhone 4S from iTunes or Find My iPhone in iCloud if you've enabled it before. But the issue here is that you will lose your data by following the above method, which you should be aware of it. Besides, if you have set up to automatically backup in iTunes before, your phone will be auto sync while connecting to iTunes. If no, then click to restore the data on your own.\nBesides, I have tried another way to recover photos from locked iPhone before, which is using the Windows Media Gallery on my PC to import the photos. But provided you have clicked to trust PC on your iPhone before. Hope this would do a favor for you.\n", "Q: Deleting old accounts from Mail I have two accounts in Mail (v. 10.3), on a MacBook Air 13\" running macOS 10.12.6. One is a work-related account with a POP configuration and the second one is from a hobby-group with an IMAP configuration. The work account has changed servers several times in the last few years. When the work account changed servers, I would add the new account, and leave the old inactive accounts on the mail app. \nToday, I tried unsuccessfully to modify an existing account with the new servers addresses. I looked up analogous situations here and on other Mac forums to find out how to deal with my old accounts. I am worried that if I remove them completely, I will lose old emails. \nCan I continue adding accounts with very similar information to old accounts without running into trouble? If not, how can I keep all my old messages under the most recent work account?\n\nA: I would remove the old accounts for the sake of organization, especially if their details, or even addresses are the same (it sounds like they might be, just with different mail server configurations). You can archive old emails on your mac using the mail app. With the mail app open, go to the menu, click Mailbox -> New Mailbox. This will allow you to create a local mailbox:\n\nClick OK, and the mailbox will be created. Copy all emails you want into this mailbox. It may help to create multiple local mailbox for organization purposes. Once all of your old emails are moved to local storage, you can remove the old accounts while keeping all of your old emails safely on your Mac.\n", "Q: macOS equivalent of `cmdtool` I recently saw someone on a Unix system run the command\ncmdtool <some_log_file.log>\nand the terminal showed a logging window that live-updated as text was entered into the log file. (I'm probably missing some arguments there.)\nIs there a Mac OS equivalent to get this behavior?\nSee cmdtool on Ubuntu man pages.\n\nA: You can use the tail command to see live output of a textual log file:\ntail -f <some_log_file.log\n\ntail does not open a new Terminal.app window, but this could be achieved with AppleScript or Automator.\n\nA: If you want to use an application, Console will do this. It's not restricted to just the log files it knows about, you can open any file.\n", "Q: i have not an apple id and password.i have iphone 5S.how unlock it without id or password I have not an apple id and password.i have iPhone5s.how unlock it.\n\nA: You can signup a Apple Id for free here:\nCreate a Apple Id\nAnd if you have the invoice of the iPhone 5S, You can go to the Apple Store offline to get help.\n", "Q: My brand new iMac is receiving iMessages sent to somebody else, how to fix this? My brand new iMac is receiving iMessages from my daughters phone, not mine. Do you have any tips how to correct this?\nI have tried to restart and shut hers off on her phone.\n\nA: In messages on your Mac, check that you are signed in to the account that is yours.\nIf not - sign out and back in to the correct Apple ID for you and not the one your daughter uses.\nAssuming you are on your account - make sure your daughter's phone number or email aren't added under the \"You can be reached for messages at:\" section. \nThis happens commonly when your Apple ID is signed in to someone else's iPhone to get apps from your account and you don't correct the messages settings. Entering your password on that phone ties their number (or possibly) email to your AppleID account for iMessage.\nGoing to that device and signing out of iMessage is the best way to remove that number permanently from your account. When that's done, also be sure her iPhone isn't using your Apple ID in iCloud settings - handoff could send messages from the phone directly to your Mac as well without it showing up in your AppleID account.\n", "Q: Can I make certain menus always show ⌥option + click results? Specifically in reference to the Volume menu item in the menu bar;\nAs I am frequently changing audio input/output settings, and never using the slider that the normal volume menu click shows (I always only use the keyboard incremental volume keys for a few reasons), I'd like to make the volume menu more useful to me by automatically always showing the menu that appears when you ⌥option + click it.\nAnd for obvious reasons I don't just want every system-wide click to be rebound to ⌥option + click, just the menu bar items if possible.\nThis sounds like a too-specific problem to have a solution, but thanks in advance if anyone could help.\n\nA: I don't know if there's a way to do exactly that, but if you can't be bothered to use the option key when clicking (maybe you're holding an instrument with the other hand or something?) then a keyboard shortcut to an AppleScript to change audio devices is probably even better.\nHere's another question that addresses this approach, and if it's not quite what you're looking for, there are plenty of other people out there talking about this as well.\n", "Q: How do I find path for Messages and WhatsApp messages backup data in iCloud? I need to retrieve Messages and WhatsApp messages backup data from iCloud but I can't find the path. Is there any possibilities to find Messages and WhatsApp messages backup data location in iCloud?\n\nA: iMessage data is not currently accessible via iCloud. This will be coming in macOS 10.13/iOS 11. You can currently only restore files from iCloud Drive, contacts, calendars/reminders and bookmarks, all from the Advanced section in iCloud.\nWhatsApp messages can be restored from Google Drive if you turned this feature on.\nAlternatively, if you turned on the device backup for iOS, either to you local Mac/PC or to iCloud, you could do a full restore to get your data back.\n", "Q: Fluctuating low/normal headphone volume on iMac Sound was working normally on this pretty new iMac for a few weeks, listening to YouTube when this strange behaviour started:\nThere is a little pop sound, then suddenly headphone audio goes very quiet (maybe 10% normal volume). There's no change in the indicated volume level (ie, the Mac thinks it's outputting normal volume).\nMaybe 30-60 seconds later, another pop and it's back to normal volume.\nAnd then repeat...\nIt affects the whole system (ie, sound effects), not just Chrome.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I have this problem. The solution that woks for me is to open Audio MIDI Setup and mute-unmute channels in Output.\n\nA: Just for completeness, when someone else looks at this question:\nFirst, look into the headphone jack for a red light or a blinking red light -> if so: ifixit.com\nThen check if the issue is caused by the headphone buttons, whick are faulty by trying another pair of headphones.\nAnd if nothing else helps, try the same as Steve and reset the PRAM: Apple KB\n", "Q: How to check individual in-app purchases as developer on iTunes Connect? Is there any way to check each in-app purchases my app is receiving on iTunes Connect?\nOn Android for example you have a list of every purchase with an ID so if a client makes a complain I can easily check if he actually made the purchase, but on iTunes I just see statistical data, but not list of every purchase, so I can't check purchase.\nMy worst fear is a purchase properly charged but not registered by our servers, so the client loses its money and I can't confirm the purchase.\n\nA: No, there's no way of doing this for non-subscription in-app purchases. It is purposely not made possible.\nThe only information you'll receive from iTunes Connect is aggregates - i.e. the statistical data, you mention. This means that you can see how many in-app purchases what made, but not the details of each individual buyer.\nFor non-consumable in-app purchases, Apple requires your app to have a Restore button that restores in-app purchases to the device. In addition to this, Apple designed the StoreKit system so that even if the user were guided to try to buy a non-consumable in-app purchase again, it will automatically switch to restore or fail completely.\nThe process is implemented in your app using the restoreCompletedTransactions() method of the SKPaymentQueue class in the StoreKit framework. Your app will receive copies of the original transactions - so even when a purchases hasn't been registered by your own servers, you'll get a copy of the transaction and receipt to be able to get another attempt at storing it on your own server.\nThis means that your worst fear is ungrounded. It is simply not possible for a user to pay for the same non-consumable in-app purchase twice.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra - Switch to English input only for several characters I'm new to Mac, and trying to do the following -\nIn previous systems, when I was on a non-English input source (e.g. Hebrew), I could mid-sentence hold down the Shift key and type some keys, and they would type as uppercase-English letters. As soon as I would release the Shift key, pressing more keys would return to writing Hebrew.\nThis is very useful for embedding some English acronyms inside a non-English sentence, like:\nאם למישהו יש OCD, הוא לא יאהב את זה שהמשפט כתוב בכיוון לא נכון.\nWhen I try this on a Mac, it either types nothing, or types some weird Hebrew characters with diacritic marks (useless).\nIs there any way to do this on Mac?\nI have a Sierra MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences/Keyboard/Input Sources and activate the Hebrew PC keyboard provided by Apple and use that (instead of Hebrew or Hebrew Qwerty).\nOr in system preferences/keyboard/input sources, check the box for using caps lock to change the keyboard to Latin.  That will let you switch to US and back to Hebrew by hitting caps lock, if you find that useful.\n", "Q: How to make executable .py file (for non-programmer)? I'm on Ubuntu 16.04 and I've created a python script for my colleague - he has MacOS. Assume that he doesn't know anything about bash or python. \nSo I don't want to make him running this script from bash.

Plus, you have to make it executable (like you do before with chmod +x). Simply name it \"jinja.command\", instead of \"jinja.py\" for example.\nThen, you will see terminal window opened with text output (if you have one in your application), as far as the \"program terminated\" string.\n\nA: You want a tool called Platypus. It provides very clear guidance on turning scripts into apps.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus/\n\nPlatypus is a Mac OS X developer tool that creates native Mac OS X applications from interpreted scripts such as shell scripts or Perl, Ruby and Python programs.

Sometimes it also happens when i press too hard on the screen\n\nA: You're holding it wrong! - Stop shaking it!\nSeriously - you're experiencing problems with defective hardware. Take it to a proper repair shop and get a fixed price on fixing the issues.\nYou should probably prepare for the fact that buying a new iPad is cheaper than repairing the old.\n", "Q: What is \"hidd\"? I tried to find some details about the daemon hidd but only found information about a Linux daemon where it is the human interface device daemon.\nIs this the same function in macOS? \n\nA: What is hidd responsible for?\nhidd is indeed an abbreviation for Human Interface Device Daemon. It is responsible for the operation of any human input devices, such as your mouse, trackpad, drawing tablet or keyboard.\nHigh CPU or memory utilisation?\nIf you are experiencing high CPU or memory utilization from hidd, you may want to restart your computer.\nCan I kill the process?\nNo, if the hidd process is killed, it will restart immediately.\n", "Q: Can I customize the launchpad grid? my launchpad feels congested. each screen displays 35 icons made up of 5 rows and 7 columns. i would like to have more space and wanted to try a 4x6 grid instead. \nI tried looking in system preferences but couldn't find any way to configure the launchpad. I also tried right clicking on its dock icon, but this only gave me the option of removing it from the dock or launching it. when it is launched, there's no way to see its preferences.\nCan I customize the launchpad grid to try a 4x6 grid?\n\nA: Yes, this is totally possible, assuming you're okay to run some terminal commands.\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal (usually found in Applications > Utilities)\n\n*First enter the following command (just copy and paste it) and press enter:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock springboard-columns -int 6\n\n*Second enter this command (just copy and paste it) and press enter:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock springboard-rows -int 4\n\n*Finally enter this command to quit and relaunch the Dock and Launchpad  (again, just copy and paste it and press enter):\ndefaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool TRUE;killall Dock\n\n*Once the Dock reappears, open Launchpad \n\n*Now you'll see a screen similar to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Be patient and wait for Launchpad to reload all the apps.\n\n\nNow you'll have a 6 x 4 grid.

Remember to also run the command at Step 4 whenever you make changes.\n", "Q: How did NordVPN implement the kill switch in their iOS app? NordVPN provides an app for their customers that manages the VPN connection to their servers. The app comes with a kill switch feature that ensures that all network traffic goes through this connection. NordVPN claim on their website (emphasis by me):\n\nThe Mobile version of the Kill Switch, used in our Android and iOS apps (as well as the IKEv2 version of the Mac app), disables system-wide internet access if the VPN connection suddenly disconnects - that way it protects all apps, without terminating them. It will also try to reconnect you to the last server you were connected to.\n\nHow is this possible? I find it hard to believe that the iOS API allows access to such an important system-wide function to an app. Can anyone explain how NordVPN implemented this?\n\nA: Kill switches on iOS only work with the IKEv2 protocol.\nIKEv2 provides resilience to the VPN connection. When the VPN client moves from one wireless hotspot to other, it automatically disconnects all internet activities when a VPN connection is lost and re-establishes the connection upon successful connectivity. \nMobile users specifically can benefit from such a protocol. However, it is not supported on many platforms as it is fairly new to VPN services.\nApple has a very strict process for getting the entitlements to allow an app to control system wide network access. You need to contact them and answer all kinds of questions before you get the entitlements.\n\nA: Most likely they force to enable \"Connect on demand\" feature available on iOS. It will route the traffic only through VPN and in case the connection is lost, user will simply be unable to get online.\n", "Q: Day-O clock not starting by itself on restarting Mac I am using  Day-O as the clock on the menu bar in place of the default clock.

However the internet connection was bad, so I ended up installing Ubuntu 17 from USB instead.\nI’ve now reformatted my hard disk and torrented a macOS Sierra installer. How can I burn it onto a USB stick?\n\nA: I have had a similar situation with a friend of mine who installed a bad copy of Windows 7 onto their mac. \nYou can retry booting into Internet Recovery Mode. If a local recovery partition isn't found, which in your case it won't be due to the hard drive formatting, the Mac will try to recover the operating system over the internet. To force a Mac into internet recovery mode, hold Option-Cmd-R at startup. This process will take some time, and you will need to select a suitable Wi-Fi or other Internet connection once the computer has started up. \nMore information on macOS recovery can be found on Apple's support site\nBest of luck to you, and note it is probably not the best idea to install a pirated copy of macOS Sierra. \nEDIT: \nAs for \"burning\" things onto a USB stick, this tool may help you. \n\nA: great idea to download it from a torrent from piratebay....

You'd also change $t/tmp.a?? in  for s in $t/tmp.a??; do and rm $t/h.tmp $t/tmp.a?? to: $t/tmp.a???\nI'd also add a Run Apple Script action to the service, with the following code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    if (item 1 of input) is \"\" then\n        display notification \"Splitting of the target file(s) is finished!\" with title \"Split CSV File(s)\"\n    else\n        display notification (item 1 of input as string) with title \"Split CSV File(s)\"\n    end if\nend run\n\nThis enables the output of the echo commands in the Run Shell Script action to display a notification if a output file already exists or when the splitting is finished.\nNote that while notification could be done from within the Run Shell Script action using osascript, nonetheless, I did it this way as it was easier to code.\n\n\nThis was tested on a file named file.csv in Finder, which has 200 lines in it, and the images below show what was created by the Run Shell Script action portion of the Automator service when run on the file.\n\n\n", "Q: block \"GET - On the App Store\" link ads in Mobile Safari A lot of mobile optimised web sites display App Store links on the top of the page.\n\nHow to block this annoying ads? I already run and ad blocker for iOS.\n\nA: I’m afraid the answer is you can’t block them, at least not through a setting in iOS or a Content Blocker extension for Safari. There are patches available for jailbroken devices though.\nThese ads are shown through the “Smart App Banners” feature of Safari. As far as I know, there is no setting in iOS to turn them off. Because of the way Safari Content Blocker extensions work, I also don’t think they can block the HTML tag that tells Safari to display the ad.\nI might just be wrong, but other sources (see: blog post, reddit thread) also indicate these banners can’t be easily disabled.\nAt least Safari does seem to remember that you don’t want to see an ad for a particular app (or on a particular site, I’m not sure) if you close the banner using the “⨯” button on the left.\n", "Q: How do i fix left click mouse behavior for Logitech M720 Bluetooth mouse?

Is apple forcing customers to have more than one device? or how do i fix this? \nProblem 2: It also gives me a message, \"Can't approve this iPhone\". If I click there it warns you that the only way to continue will be by resetting all my info on iCloud which is something I DO NOT WANT to do.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  I actually had an old ipod associated with my account that I didn't realize and had to remove it.\nGo to: https://appleid.apple.com\nAnd choose \"Manage your Account\".\nLook at your devices and see if you  have any old devices.  If so, remove them.  That is what worked for me.\n\nA: I just sorted this issue out on my phone with somebody from Apple customer service.\nAll you have to do is to go to the bottom of the page where it says something like: \"Can't approve this iphone?\", click on this option and you will have to reset your encrypted data. Don't worry because you will lose nothing. This encrypted data is connected to your Keychain option in your iphone which stores your passwords you use to automatically loggin into different apps. You will just be asked to re-loggin, if this will be the case, when you will use an app for which you've saved the loggin password.\nOnce you followed all steps in resetting your encrypted data you will be redirected back to the original screen and you will have to click again on \"Continue\", enter again your password for your Apple ID account and this should be all. Your phone should work and it will be approved.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: There should be the option to receive a SMS code instead (if you have a phone linked to your Apple ID). If you didn't receive this option whilst setting up your iPhone then skip and once you are in the springboard you can go into settings and do so via the iCloud settings panel.\n", "Q: Transfer music from iPad's iTunes to MacBook's, devices have different iTunes accounts My Dad has an iPad with a lot of songs downloaded onto its iTunes library. Is it possible for me to put the songs onto my MacBook?\nThe iPad uses my Dad's iTunes account and the MacBook mine.\n\nA: The only way I know of to share iTunes content between multiple Apple IDs is their family sharing plan. My father and I use it to share movies and TV shows with each other. Apple gives instructions for setting up family sharing. While it is nice to share content, it definitely has drawbacks. The biggest is that there can only be one credit card registered to all accounts under a family plan. Hope this helps.\n\nA: No, it's generally not possible to transfer the synced music from the iPad to your MacBook using conventional (i.e. Apple supplied) means.\nYou would need to copy over the songs from your Dad's Mac (or where it originated from).\n", "Q: Is this dust inside Retina Display on my Macbook Pro 13 inch? I have a late 2015 13 Inch Macbook Pro with Retina Display, and here are the pics of that. Could anyone please suggest how do I get these spots of my screen?\nRegards,\nBengalurean\n\n\nA: Judging by your photo's this is not dust but the anti-reflective coating peeling of the screen.\nAs jksoegaard correctly states in the comments, apple has an extended warranty in place for this issue.\nThis article tells you more about it, and here it is mentioned on apple's forum.\n\nYou should contact your nearest apple service provider, they are very likely to replace your display for free.\n", "Q: Do I have an SSD and a hard drive on my MacBook Pro? I looked at the details provided in  my\nsystem report/storage and I noticed that it appears I have a hard drive of 499.05GB and an additional SSD drive of 499.42GB. Does this mean I have 1TB of data? I only have 139GB available so do I have 500GB 'hiding' somewhere? (If so where??) \nI am unsure how to interpret this information- why does it list both storage types? Is it duplicating the information?\n\nMacintosh HD:\nAvailable:    139.8 GB (139,800,666,112 bytes)\n  Capacity: 499.05 GB (499,046,809,600 bytes)\n  Mount Point:  /\n  File System:  Journaled HFS+\n  Writable: Yes\n  Ignore Ownership: No\n  BSD Name: disk1\n  Volume UUID:  EF0908C8-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX80333709   \nLogical Volume:  Revertible:  Yes (unlock and decryption required)\n  Encrypted:    Yes\n  Encryption Type:  AES-XTS\n  Locked:   No\n  LV UUID:  8CC9C88D-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX2002329B  \nLogical Volume Group:\n  Name:    Macintosh HD   Size:    499.42 GB (499,418,034,176 bytes)\n  Free Space:  18.9 MB (18,903,040 bytes)\n   LVG  UUID: EE040070-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXA83B309   \nPhysical Volumes:\ndisk0s2:     #is this a second disk?\nDevice Name:  APPLE SSD SM0512G\n  Media Name: APPLE SSD  SM0512G\n  Media   Size:   499.42 GB (499,418,034,176 bytes)\n  Medium Type:  SSD\n   Protocol:  PCI\n   Internal:  Yes\n  Partition Map Type: GPT(GUID Partition Table)  #does this mean its partitioned?\n  Status: Online\n  S.M.A.R.T.

It's still only one device with ~500 GB disk space.\nThe main partition of your SSD is encrypted with FileVault2. While enabling FV2 the main partition is transformed to CoreStorage which is an LVM - an additional layer between physical disk and file system. The resulting Logical Volume is shown as an additional disk in Disk Utility/diskutil info.\nA common partition layout looks like this:\ndisk0 (500.1 GB) → disk0s1 (209.7 MB) EFI\n                 ↘︎ disk0s2 (499.4 GB) Macintosh HD\n                 ↘︎ disk0s3 (650.0 MB) Recovery HD\n\ndisk0s2 (Macintosh HD) is mounted to root (/)\nAfter converting the disk to CoreStorage, disk0s2 is converted to a Physical Volume which sets up a Logical Volume Group. The existing file system on disk0s2 is shrunk a bit, converted to a Logical Volume and encrypted:\ndisk0 (500.1 GB) → disk0s1 (209.7 MB) EFI\n                 ↘︎ disk0s2 (499.4 GB) LVG/PV → disk1    (499.05 GB) LV/Macintosh HD\n                                             ↘︎ metadata (~370 MB)\n                 ↘︎ disk0s3 (650.0 MB) Recovery HD\n\nNow disk1 (~disk0s2) is mounted to root (/).\nSo disk1 is almost congruent to disk0s2 (except some 100 MB at the end of disk0s2 which is used for metadata and isn't encrypted).\n\nCoreStorage is not limited to encrypt volumes as FileVault2 \"container\". Every regular volume can be converted to a CS LVG/PV/LV. Apple uses it to create Fusion Drives and SSDs are usually partitioned/formatted as CoreStorage volumes.\n", "Q: Get Numbers & Pages et al. on macOS 10.11 El Capitan I have some old macs which cannot update to OSX 10.12, however this is the minimum requirement for installing those applications from the app store. Please could someone advise how to get an older, compatible version of this software legally through Apple? Thanks!\n\nA: I had this issue too. Whenever I used an Apple ID that hadn't previously downloaded iWork I wasn't able to download the free version on 10.11. I even tried this workaround.\nWhat did work was getting access to a 10.12 Mac. Downloading Pages, Numbers and Keynote. The apps were now associated to that Apple ID. I then went back to the 10.11 Mac's, signed in using the same ID and clicked download.

Apple has been misspelling the city \"West Des Moines\" as \"West des Moines\" (no capital \"D\") for quite some time now. I tried reporting this issue a number of times through the Maps application during the past few years, but it has still not been fixed.\nHow do I go about getting the city name fixed? Who does Apple get the data for its cities on its Maps application? I'm guessing Apple's map provider or providers need to fix this at their level.\n\nThe same issue occurs when I take a pic in West Des Moines.

Thinking logically setting perspective wallpaper requires some constant recalculations of background position. When I hold my iPhone and move hand, I see that effect. It's nice and pleases the eye but I'm sure that it requires some CPU calculations and that triggers higher energy consumption since nothing's for free…\nQuestion is - how much energy is consumed by this setting over still and can this have a significant impact on battery life in a longer time perspective?\n\n\nA: Whilst it would reduce battery as its constantly using sensor data and updating the display it doesn't (in my experience) reduce the battery noticeably, however on older devices it does cause some FPS issue, in which case reduce motion is recommended as well as a still background image.\n\nA: \"Low Power Mode\" (in the Battery settings) says that some visual effects are reduced or turned off. I have most of the distractions turned off by default, so I don't know if the perspective effect is one of the ones which is turned off in low power mode. But even if Apple feels that it does have a calculable effect, it is probably not noticeable over the course of a normal charge cycle. \n", "Q: Cannot install macOS update with error \"cannot verify this update\" While installing the macOS 10.12.6 Sierra update from the Mac App Store, my system rebooted with the error, “Cannot verify this update.”\nI’m trying to upgrade from macOS 10.12.5 to 10.12.6.\n\nA: Try downloading the macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Combo Update instead. Then open the dmg file and run the installer.\nThe combo updater includes all minor updates since the .1 release, and it is therefore larger than the delta update. However since it reapplies any system changes brought on by previous updates, it should resolve any issues that came up during regular updates.\n", "Q: Which display controller board to use for 13\" MacBook Pro (mid-2012, unibody) display panel?

For some reason there is no boot camp control panel installed.\nNot sure how to fix/debug this!\n\nA: Try booting into the recovery mode (Hold CMD + R at boot) and test wether it works there, if it does then is a software issues and a full bootcamp reinstall may be required if it doesn't then its likely a hardware issue in which case a repair would be your best bet.

For example en0.\nTo find which interface you want to reset, you can see the output of ifconfig.\nOr if you are lazy, you can just copy/paste this line, which will set $if to the interface which is used to access the Internet:\nif=$(route -n get 0.0.0.0 2>/dev/null | awk '/interface: / {print $2}') && echo $if\n\nSo in the right order:\nif=$(route -n get 0.0.0.0 2>/dev/null | awk '/interface: / {print $2}') && echo $if\nsudo ipconfig set $if DHCP && echo OK\n\n\nA: The Network Command Cheat Sheet at Krypted.com has this example:\n\nSet the interface called Wi-Fi to obtain it if it isn’t already\nnetworksetup -setdhcp Wi-Fi\n\nYou need to replace Wi-Fi with the interface name bound to en0.\n\nA: (I just realized, years later, that my previous \"answer\" actually wasn't an answer to the real question at all.)\nThe real question seems to be \"How to run a command which requires sudo without needing to enter a password?\".\nThe solution is to use the NOPASSWD: option in the sudoers file, followed by the command for which you want to suppress the password prompt.\nDo NOT use NOPASSWD: ALL as suggested in many examples, but specify the command(s) which will not require a password.\nAlso, the /private/etc/sudoers file in MacOS seems to be overwritten on updates.

I’m wondering if it is technically possible for an app developer to allow running BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) projects directly on iOS devices.\n\nA: Technically, it is possible. In fact, there’s a paper titled “Exploring mobile devices as Grid resources: Using an x86 virtual machine to run BOINC on an iPhone”. The paper was published in 2009, the abstract says:\n\n[…] In this paper we propose the use of mobile devices themselves as grid computing nodes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this concept by implementing the BOINC client on an Apple iPhone. Work units are downloaded from a BOINC server and executed on the iPhone via a virtual machine emulating an x86 processor, and results are uploaded to the server. […]\n\nWhether Apple would allow such an app on the iOS App Store though is another matter. BOINC has an Android app, but no iOS app, and their FAQ says:\n\nCan I run BOINC on my iPhone?\nThere are currently some technical and legal barriers to doing volunteer computing on iPhones. It's possible that in the future these issues can be overcome.\n\nA member of the BOINC project has mentioned one problem for them:\n\nAs I understand the main problem of creating iOS BOINC app is that app can't download executable files […]\n\nThe App Store Review Guideline he is referring to is:\n\n2.5.2 Apps should be self-contained in their bundles, and may not read or write data outside the designated container area, nor may they download, install, or execute code, including other apps. […]\n\nAs far as I know, there are no other volunteer computing project apps on the iOS App Store. I’m guessing another guideline that might be troublesome for such apps is:\n\n2.4.2 Design your app to use power efficiently. Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources.\n\nVolunteering computing resources is of course likely to cause a rapidly draining battery and other strain. Whether or not this counts as “unnecessary” when the user is giving the app explicit permission to donate computing resources is something that would have to be argued with Apple.\n", "Q: Mac magic keyboard F keys not working After updating Yosemite on an iMac 2011 for some reason my F keys on my magic keyboard stopped working.

It should be: tell application \"Finder\"\nThat said, you have as Tags, macos, mac, applescript and automator and did not state in the OP where and how you've applied the code to the target folder, this_folder, as a Folder Action.  In other words, if you've created the Folder Action in Automator and have just that code as the code in a Run AppleScript action, even with the double-quotes around Finder, it will fail. That coding structure is only valid as an AppleScript .scpt file assigned to a Folder Action using Folder Actions Setup... on the Services section of the contact menu in Finder.\nThe following example code is how I'd write it as an AppleScript .scpt file assigned to a Folder Action using Folder Actions Setup... on the Services section of the contact menu in Finder.\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items\n    try\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            repeat with this_item in added_items\n                if (class in (get properties of this_item) as string) is \"«class cfol»\" then\n                    make new folder at this_item with properties {name:\"Main\"}\n                    make new folder at this_item with properties {name:\"Lower\"}\n                    make new folder at this_item with properties {name:\"Upper\"}\n                end if\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end try\nend adding folder items to\n\nNote that even though by using the try statement, it should eat any errors, nonetheless, I've also added an if statement to make sure the item being acted upon is a folder, not a file. Note that while the if statement is not absolutely necessary, nonetheless, it's a more proper way to write code in my opinion, however, it could be left out if you want.\nUser's AppleScript .scpt files for Folder Actions should be saved to, e.g.:\n/Users/me/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/filename.scpt\n\n\nIf you are creating the Folder Action via Automator, then in the Run AppleScript action use the following example code_:\non run {input, parameters}\n    try\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            repeat with this_item in input\n                if (class in (get properties of this_item) as string) is \"folder\" then\n                    make new folder at this_item with properties {name:\"Main\"}\n                    make new folder at this_item with properties {name:\"Lower\"}\n                    make new folder at this_item with properties {name:\"Upper\"}\n                end if\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end try\nend run\n\n\nNote that I have tested both example code blocks under the conditions stated above and it works as coded.\n", "Q: Can I install downloaded app even if it's not available on the App Store I have few app that was downloaded to my Mac, now there are not available on the iOS App Store anymore, so can I install them when I get a new phone even those app are not available on the App Store?\n\nA: Yes. You can synchronise them by connecting your iPhone to iTunes on your Mac. It will synchronise all the apps that are in your iTunes library with your new iPhone.\nThat's why it's handy to download apps in iTunes as well. Also updates and keeping older versions from the app around. So you can go back to an older version when there is a bug introduced in the newer version.\n\nA: To preface this with a little fyi: Mac Apps and iOS apps are not related. The stores are similar and there are many apps that have been made for both stores but they make separate apps for each platform and one will not work on the other.\nBecause of this, what I think you mean is that you made an iTunes backup of your phone and want to restore it to your new phone with Apps that have been removed from the store still installed. It should work if you are able to restore directly from the backup, but be warned that that will only work as long as your backup's iOS version is relatively current. As it gets older, iTunes will perform an update pass that will likely remove it during flashing.\n", "Q: How to diagnose the SMC?

Usually this directory is not part of PATH so you need to specify the full path to run it (/usr/local/bin/jq).\n\nA: The primary issue being pointed out is not really an AppleScript issue per se. In other words, while the do shell script command is an AppleScript command, nonetheless, the issue is that the command(s) called by the do shell script command are not AppleScript commands, they are shell commands and as such are subject to the environment passed to the shell when the  do shell script command is executed.\nThe PATH passed to a do shell script command is /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin, and any executable called that is not within that PATH, then the fully qualified pathname needs to be used.\nThe PATH environment variable is a colon-delimited list of directories that your shell searches through when you enter a command.\nApparently jq is not within that PATH. In other words, jq is not located in one of the following locations: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\nSo, your choices are either symlink or move jq to one of those locations, or use the fully qualified pathname of the jq executable in the jq command within the commands of the do shell script command.\nIn the do shell script command, change jq to /path/to/jq\nExample: /usr/local/bin/jq\nSubstitute /usr/local/bin/ with the actual /path/to/ the jq executable.\nYou might be able to ascertain its path in Terminal using the following command:\nwhich jq\n\nOn my system the result of which jq is: /usr/local/bin/jq\nIf that doesn't work, then use the following command in Terminal:\nfind / -iname jq 2>/dev/null\n\nSo, you really do not need to understand AppleScript because the issue is a shell issue.

I want to be able to make a keyboard shortcut system wide on a Mac that will paste some text into whatever I am selecting. For example, I am typing in notes and I press cmd + alt + k, then text that says \"Hello World!\" will paste into the text box. I was looking for other answers to this but couldn't find any.\n\nA: You could create this using AppleScript and run it using Automator.\nCreate a script:\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"Hello World.\"\n\nReplace \"Hello World.\" with your desired text, but make sure to keep the quotation marks around whatever text you input as that is what is making the data type a string.\nNext, use Automator to trigger the above AppleScript:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator. \n\n*Create a new services workflow. \n\n*Set Service Recieves to no input.\n\n*Set in to any application.\n\n*Under \"Actions\" in the left pane, search for \"Run AppleScript.\"\n\n*Once you find that, drag \"Run AppleScript\" over to the right pane, which enters it into your workflow. \n\n*Save the workflow. \n\n\nFinally, use System Preferences to assign this workflow to a global hotkey. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Click Keyboard.\n\n*Click Keyboard Shortcuts. \n\n*Scroll down to and select Services in the left pane. \n\n*In the right pane, search for the name of the Automator workflow that you just saved and click on the checkbox to the left of the file name. \n\n*Hold down your desired keyboard shortcut and it will automatically assign this workflow to your selected hotkeys. \n\n\nThis is probably the easiest way of accomplishing your desired task while writing the least amount of code as possible. \nThere is also a tool called Alfred that is outstanding; I use it many times on a daily basis. At this point I would probably be lost without it. It can completely take over spotlight for you (in fact I deleted the hotkey to bring up spotlight search (cmd + space) and assigned that hotkey to open Alfred instead. Within Alfred you can do things such as copy text from one place, then copy more text from somewhere else and append them together, do anything that you can do in Spotlight search, plus much, much more. The reason that I bring up Alfred is because you can create this same exact workflow within Alfred and assign it to a system wide hotkey all within the same application without writing and code at all (if you consider the example that I just gave to actually be writing code). In fact, the types of workflows you can create in Alfred is essentially limitless and there are even already built recipes online, for different applications that you can download.\n\nA: If you are fine with installing 3rd party software, one feature of BetterTouchTool does what you are looking for\nhttp://docs.bettertouchtool.net/docs/key_sequences.html\nAccording to the creators at https://www.boastr.net/ BetterTouchTools is available as a trial version.\n\nA: This is not a keyboard shortcut per se but you can define letters to represent a word or phrase.

I recently installed Snow Leopard on a 2 TB USB 3.0 hard drive for my 2009 White MacBook, since the internal hard drive is broken (it no longer shows up during boot or in Disk Utility).\nThe external drive boots to the login screen in 1-2 minutes. But then it becomes completely unresponsive for about 10-20 minutes (I can move the mouse around, but I can’t click or type anything).\nAfter 10-20 minutes, everything works perfectly and behaves just like when Snow Leopard was originally installed on the internal drive.\nI am wondering if this “load” time is expected when using an external hard drive for your operating system.\n\nA: \nThe external drive boots just fine to the login screen in 1-2 minutes.\n  But then it becomes completely unresponsive for about 10-20 minutes\n  after that (I can move the mouse around, but I can’t click or type\n  anything).\n\n10-20 minutes seems a bit long, but not far fetched; remember, you are actually connecting via USB 2.0 to a spinning hard drive. The White MacBook in 2009 came with a USB 2.0 port; even if you plug in a USB 3.0 drive, it will \"fall back\" to USB 2.0 speeds.\nMaximum theoretical data transfer speeds:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB 2.0 = 480 Mbit/s (60 MB/s)\n\n*USB 3.0 = 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s)\n\n*USB 3.1 = 10 Gbit/s (1.21 GB/s)\n\n*SATA III = Up to 6 Gbit/s (750 MB/s) \n\n*SATA II  = Up to 3 Gbits/s (300 MB/s)\n\n\nUSB 2.0 is more than 10x slower than SATA III and 5x slower than SATA II (3Gbits/s or 300MB/s).

I have been having quite the struggle trying to update my Mid-2009 MBP to the \"latest\" MacOS.\nInitially I wanted to install Sierra. I booted (CMD-R), wiped the main partition, then attempted to upgrade. The only available option was Mountain Lion, which was already installed. Even this install was not possible as when I entered my Apple ID, I kept receiving the \"This Action Could not be completed, please try again\".\nFinally I gave up, and restored from backup.\nSince then I realized that it's not possible to update to Sierra as this Mac is too old. So I would like to install El Capitan. However it's not available in the app store.\nI have a developer account, so I downloaded the combo update, but of course it can't be installed on top of mountain lion.\nI've tried creating USB installers, however none of them have worked, they just show the \"prohibited\" symbol (/).\nCan anyone help me get El Capitan installed? Thanks so much.\n\nA: As per the support documentation you should be able to download El Capitan from the App Store.\nIf you've previously downloaded El Capitan with your Apple ID (e.g. onto another device), you should find it on the \"Purchased\" tab.\n", "Q: Homebrew git reporting older version I have just upgraded git. It's now a symlink to the Cellared most recent version.\n$ ls -l `which git`\n/usr/local/bin/git -> ../Cellar/git/2.14.1/bin/git\n\nHowever\n$git --version\ngit version 2.11.0 (Apple Git-81)\n\nDo I have two different versions installed at once? How can I clean up the remnants of the Apple Git-81 version?\n\nA: In ~/.bash_profile you should amend PATH to prefer binaries supplied by homebrew. You can do this with the line:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\nAfter changing .bash_profile you will need to open a new Terminal.app window to see the change take place. Alternatively, you can source ~/.bash_profile to load in the profile into the current session.\n\nA: For me Homebrew installed into a different directory so I had to find that and add that to the PATH.  Brew info git does not tell you either so you may just have to hunt for it.  For me, the path below worked for me.\nexport PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/git/2.34.1/bin:$PATH\nThen, as others said above, you must add it to your ~/bash_profile so that your PATH is changed the next time you reboot.\nNote: 2.34.1 is your version number so you will have to use your version number\nYou could also create/change a link that is probably already in /usr/local/bin to point to your path.  See this link for details on how to do that:\nHow can I create a symbolic link in Terminal?\nUsing a link is probably the recommended way to fix this.\n", "Q: No Router — SMB not working over WAN My home iMac is connected directly to my modem via ethernet. File Sharing is turned on.\nIf I turn on Internet Sharing and connect my Macbook to the resulting wifi network, I can access files on my iMac via Finder → Go → Connect to Server → smb://<my iMac's internal IP>\nSince my iMac is connected directly to my modem, I should be able to use the same process to connect from work. I open Finder and type smb://<my home's external IP> Unfortunately, this leads to an error message (\"There was a problem connecting to the server.\")\nInterestingly, my iMac also has screen sharing enabled. Unlike SMB, this works properly from both home and work.\nHow can I make SMB work over WAN?\nEdit: Despite some security concerns that were raised in the comments, I would still like to know how to do this! I'm actively researching possible risks, but haven't found anything specific, and it's out of scope on this site. I want this to work natively in Finder.\n\nA: As suspected by @klanomath in the comments (thank you!), the problem was that my ISP, Time Warner Cable, blocks port 445.\nThe solution was to change macOS's SMB listening port, which can be adjusted by editing /etc/services. Open the file and scroll down until you find two lines that read:\nmicrosoft-ds    445/udp     # Microsoft-DS\nmicrosoft-ds    445/tcp     # Microsoft-DS\n\nOn both lines, change 445 to a different, unused port. Save and reboot your computer†. From now on, you will need to append :port-number to the end of your IP address whenever you connect to your Mac via SMB.\nPotential security issues aside, this solution feels very \"clean\" and allows me connect to my iMac via Finder, whereas a protocol such as sftp would require 3rd party software. While my own research has not turned up any concrete security risks affecting the latest version of macOS, anyone opening SMB to WAN should be sure to set a very strong password on their user account.\n\nCredit to this answer on Superuser for pointing me in the right direction.\n†If you opened the file in TextEdit or a similar graphical program, you may get a permissions error when you try to save. Either save in a different location and copy to /etc/ manually, or use sudo nano to avoid the problem.\n", "Q: If someone has access to my iCloud account, can they see all my text messages or just my iMessages? I gave my best friend my iCloud/Apple ID password because she forgot hers. Does that allow her to see all of my text messages that are incoming and outgoing, or only my iMessages?\nAlso, if my new conversations start off with my number, will she have access to them if the person I’m texting has an iPhone?\n\nA: To start off, as of August 2017, there is no way to view or send iMessages from the web. So before she could view your conversations, your friend would need to register one of her Apple devices with iMessage using your Apple ID.\nWhen that happens, you will get a notification on all of your devices, informing you that some new device is now registered to use your Apple ID and phone number for iMessage.\n\nYour friend will then be able to see all iMessages you send and receive. It doesn’t matter if you initiate conversations from your phone number or from your Apple ID. Not only will she be able to see everything, she can also impersonate you (by sending iMessages on your behalf, from both your phone number and Apple ID).\nRegular text messages (SMS/MMS) work a bit differently. They are sent and received through your cellphone carrier, then forwarded from your iPhone to your other devices. Even if your friend registered her Apple device with iMessage using your Apple ID, you would still need to go into Settings → Messages → Text Message Forwarding and allow forwarding to her Apple device.\nCurrently, registering a new device for iMessage only allows that device to view new messages that are sent and received. However starting in iOS 11, with iCloud Messages, registering a new device will allow it to view all conversations synced to iCloud, past and future.\nText conversations are absolutely the least of your worries, however. Much more importantly, with your Apple ID password, your friend can login to iCloud.com and read your email, impersonate you by sending email on your behalf, use your email to change your password on other websites (and essentially login to any of your accounts, anywhere), view your photos synced to iCloud Photo Library, access your contacts and view their private information, etc.\nIn essence you’ve given her full access to your account, much of your private life, and private data belonging to your friends and family. In many ways, you’ve given her your identity.\nRemember that arguments and falling-outs do happen, even among best friends. If/when that happens, she could also change the password on your iCloud account and steal it from you.\nI strongly recommend you visit id.apple.com, and change your password immediately. Then remove any devices she may have registered with your Apple ID.\nI’m just not sure how giving her your account password solves the problem where she forgot hers. What she needs to do is recover her own Apple ID.\n", "Q: Dual WiFi network cards route outgoing traffic to specific cards Let's say I have two wireless networks I can connect to, alpha and beta. \nIn this scenario the alpha wifi gives me access to a specific intranet and specific sites I need to access, and blocks specific sites. For example http://someblockedsite.com. \nThe beta connection however does not have access to the intranet but does allow access to the blocked sites.\nThe case now is that I'm switching back and forth between the two connections, and it's really a pain point, it's slow and confusing.\nI'm on a Macbook Pro, and I've been thinking about purchasing an external WiFi dongle with which I would be able to connect to one network with my Macbook WiFi card and the other with the external dongle. Ideally I would be able to use something like the hosts file to modify the outgoing traffic on my machine so that when I access one domain http://onlyalpha.com it will use the alpha connection and when I access the http://onlybeta.com site it will use the beta connection.\nIs something like this possible?\n\nA: This would probably be a lot of work for people that don’t set up networks for a living, but let’s assume you have a good reason and propose a solution.\nYou would need to serve two networks so that each AirPort connects to a different network segment so each could have different routing or different DNS. All the setup would be on the network side and you wouldn’t really need to do anything other than set up DHCP on each wireless adapter and possibly set up a hosts file over-ride or tunnel traffic to onlybeta.com through a server / gateway on the network for the beta wireless card.\n", "Q: Resetting the USB port on a MacBook Pro I am trying to get information on how to reset the USB port on a MacBook Pro using terminal's command line.  I use the USB port to access a network device via a serial port with an ioread GUC232A to conduct automation.  When the script is done, I have to physically disconnect and re-connect the USB<->Serial adapter in order to free the MacBook USB port for a subsequent automation run.  As you can see, this is not workable.\nI've looked at the following solution but it does not work very reliably and frankly, I'm not too keen on unloading and reloading drivers.\nsudo kextunload IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext\nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext\n\nI could use a single port terminal server from Lantronix to access the terminal server via SSH, which is in turn connected via RS232 - But this solution is not on the table at this point.\nAny suggestions on a USB to Ethernet Terminal server, where the USB port will act as a console to access the networking device would be appreciated.\n\nA: Update:  \nThere are two ways to reset a USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware (see below).  This acts like plugging and unplugging a device. Great for when testing a single device that needs to be reset.\n\n*Software (How to restart USB subsystem?).  This will completely reset the USB bus.  Great for when the USB subsystem is hung up.\n\n\n\nI saw a similar scenario solved by putting a momentary switch in-line with the USB +5V line on the USB cable (usually the red connector).  When the engineer wanted to reset the device (simulate removing then reinserting the device), he would depress (held it for a second or two) the switch cutting power to the USB device.  When the released it, power would be restored re-powering the device and the computer would reload it.\n\nThe advantage this had over doing something on Terminal was that it affected only the device in question and not all devices on the entire USB bus.\nDoing a quick search, I was able to find pre-made switches that accomplish this for less than $10 USD\n\nFor a less \"cludgy\" solution, you could get a USB hub with individual power switches like the Sabrent 4 Port.\n", "Q: Displays won't sleep while screen-saver is running So, I've got my screen-saver set to come on after 5 minutes,\n\n… and my display to sleep after 1 hour:\n\nUnfortunately, I get up every morning, and the displays are still running Aerial.

The easiest and guaranteed working solution which i found out after lots of experimentation is to get this software Better Touch Tool and configure a quick shortcut \"Ctrl+L\" to lock/sleep the display. So I can manually do it when I am stepping out from the desk or for overnight downloads. \nYou might already have done this. I am just putting this here for other's sake. You will have to enable this option too so that when u lock the display, it asks for the login password when u wake it up.

My local domain is njj.chickenkiller.com.\nRunning on my Mac, if you query the DNS, it returns the LAN address of various machines on my network. E.g.:\nbeethoven:~ nick$ dig serv2.njj.chickenkiller.com\n\n; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> serv2.njj.chickenkiller.com\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 36867\n;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0\n\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;serv2.njj.chickenkiller.com.

I also have both Windows 7 and Linux machine running on the network when I use the ping command (or any other command) they always use the LAN address (192.168.2.4), so I assume that this is something specific to macOS.\nWhy is this important to me? The router I have from my ISP discards packets from the LAN attempting to access machines using the WAN address.

My local DNS server didn't recognize njj.chickenkiller.com as part of the local domain and responded by giving the external IP address.\nTo solve this I added njj.chickenkiller.com as an alias for serv2 in the hosts file used by dnsmasq:\n# Fixed IP machines\n192.168.2.1 gateway\n192.168.2.2 wifi1\n192.168.2.3 wifi2\n192.168.2.4 serv2   njj.chickenkiller.com\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro boots to mostly white screen with random pixel pattern So my girlfriend's \"oldish\" MacBook Pro (Model #: A1286?) won't boot.

But because of the way the issue is only showing up in El Capitan im thinking its an issue / setting in the OS rather than on the mouse.\n\n\nA: I suspect El Capitan is interpreting this action on your Logitech LS1 Laser mouse as a double-tap with two fingers.\nAssuming this is the case, you can try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on the Mouse preference pane\n\n*Select the More Gestures tab\n\n*Uncheck the Mission Control box\n\n\nA: The solution was to use the mouse's driver / settings menu to configure what the centre button does. In the logitech software there was an option to set what the centre mouse wheel button does when clicked. See screenshot below of the options it provides, i would presume most other major mouse manufactures have software similar to this for their products. \n\n", "Q: iTunes iCloud status: Uploaded I subscribe to Apple Music (streaming) but not iTunes Match. I ripped a (somewhat rare?) CD, and was surprised to see its status as \"Uploaded\". Sure enough it plays on my other iTunes-enabled devices.\nSince I'm not paying for Match, what service/subscription is this part of? What are the limits? The file does not seem to be counting towards my iCloud usage, at least not from what I can see in the System Prefs usage graph.\n\n\n\nA: This service is part of iCloud Music Library, which is a feature of both MUSIC and iTunes Match. It uploads songs that did not match against the iTunes music collection, and does not count towards your iCloud storage allowance.\niCloud Music Library as a whole is a broader service that encompasses the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchased tracks (previously called iTunes in the Cloud)\n\n*Tracks matched or uploaded with iTunes Match\n\n*Tracks matched or uploaded with Apple Music\n\n*Streaming tracks that you’ve added to My Music, if you have an Apple Music subscription\n\n\nWhen the “music locker” functionality launched originally with iTunes Match, the limit was 25,000 songs. However starting in December 2015, this has been increased to 100,000 songs.\nNote that some songs may be ineligible to be either Matched or Uploaded. This includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Songs with a bitrate of 96 kbps or lower\n\n*Some songs encoded in 24-bit\n\n*Songs larger than 200 MB\n\n*DRM-protected songs, and songs your computer is otherwise not authorized to play\n\n*Digital booklets and other non-song items in your iTunes Music Library\n\n*Music videos that weren’t purchased on the same iTunes account\n\n\nRegarding the first two, you can re-encode them in 16-bit, 128 kbps, and you might get a 256 kbps Matched version out of the deal.\n", "Q: Installing macOS Sierra on iMac 2008 new hard drive I've just installed a new hard drive in my 2008 iMac. As my old one died I put a copy of macOS Sierra on a USB stick, but when I try to boot from it all I get is the no entry sign.\nAny ideas what I’m doing wrong? Do I possibly need an older version macOS?\n\nA: You need at least a 2009 iMac to run macOS 10.12 Sierra.\nThe latest version of macOS that supports the 2008 iMac is macOS 10.11 El Capitan.\n\nA: True: For an officially supported version of a mac operating system you have to go with a maximum of El Capitan.\nHowever, you may insist on installing macOS Sierra 10.12 on this unsupported machine.\nThat is made possible with overriding the Apple blacklist that prevents installation and results in the \"No Entry Sign\". This can be simplified with Sierra Patcher. \n\"Requirements:\n-Early-2008 or newer [… ] iMac, […]\"\nKnown issue: There might then be issues with WiFi/Airport on iMac 8,2 models if they have an incompatible Airport card installed. Sierra lacks drivers for these. But the cards may be upgraded or an external adapter used.\n", "Q: iPad remote management, but not on apples DEP I have a dilemma. I work for a decentralized organization with independent business units.  We’re now starting to centralize the support of IT. \nI have a few companies who bought their own iPads from like Best Buy, amazon and the Apple Store. I had read that you cannot enter consumer purchased iPads into the DEP program.\nI have 20 iPads I want to manage and maintain, but it also seems like an Apple ID is a MUST to do literally anything. I read somewhere that an Apple ID has a max limit of 10 devices.\nThe other problem is when I add a new iPad it sends alerts to ALL the other iPads, which could interrupt or scare a user in a different location.\nMy question is, how best can I manage and maintain 20+ iPads? I’m currently using InTune, but features a limited without Apples DEP and still requires an AppleID to install any apps.\n\nA: Check out What's new in DEP from WWDC17. All devices can now be enrolled into DEP regardless of purchase source. Apple Configurator will allow you to provision any device for DEP however these device will be put into a 30 day trial period where the device will display a warning on the lock screen and can be un enrolled at any time.\n", "Q: Can I delete all the iOS apps on my Mac and still do full phone backups? My hard drive is starting to reach its limit, and on inspection it appears one of the primary culprits is files listed in the System Information storage manager as \"iTunes\":\n\nThese are almost all iOS apps.\nIs there any reason to have these on my Mac? Can I just delete them? If so is there a preferred method (e.g. from within iTunes vs Finder)? And, how did they get there in the first place? Critically, I assume they are not part of (or necessary for) the secured full backup (\"This computer\" > \"Encrypt iPhone backup\" in iTunes) of my phone (which appears to be under \"iOS Files\"); is that right?\nCan I delete all the iOS apps on my Mac and still do full phone backups and restores?\n\nA: You're correct. Since iOS 9, the \"usual\" way that iOS apps are reinstalled after restoring an iTunes backup is by downloading them again from the App Store after you finish the setup process signing in with your Apple ID.\nNote: Having the apps stored in iTunes is a must if there's an app you want to keep installing on devices, but isn't on the app store anymore (think Flappy Bird). The library in iTunes is the only way to get it then. I don't worry about this personally, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention it.\nThe \"by the book\" way to delete them is in iTunes Library > Apps. You can select multiple with Shift + click or  Command + click, and then right-click and select Delete from Library. Then select to Move Files to Trash.\n\nYou can definitely delete all of the apps in the iTunes Library and still do full backups and restores.\nThe apps themselves are not in the backup, only notes about what apps were installed (so it can be re-downloaded from the App Store), and the data stored for those apps.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra: Safari dialog opens with no buttons Whenever I open safari, this alert opens with no buttons.

I have a MacBook Pro with two partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS partition (200 GB). \n\n*Linux partition (100 GB).\n\n\nWhen I enter the Recovery Mode and open Disk Utility, and click \"partition\" on my whole HD device, I can see a pie chart showing each partition and its size. \nMy goal is to delete the Linux partition and get back to the normal state where my Mac has a full 300 GB of storage instead of 200 GB. \nMy question is:\nIf on the pie chart I clicked on the Linux partition and clicked the minus \"-\" symbol, will it achieve my goal?\nIs it going to delete my Linux partition and give its size to the Mac without losing any data on my Mac partition?\n\nA: The answer is no you will not lose your data.\nYou now are a potential member in the \"Unintended Consequences\" club. So what we do here is change \"no\" to \"you probably won't lose data if everything goes well.\"\nWhich means, backup the entire Mac partition and then boot from the backup and make sure it is good before proceeding.\nOnce you have your backup that Murphy's Law of Unnecessary Backups says you will now never need the backup you just made, you may now proceed with deleting the Linux partition and expanding the macOS partition into the empty space. Which is not supposed to delete anything on your macOS partition, if everything goes well.\n\nA: *\n\n*No - you won't lose Mac data.\n\n*You need to delete the linux partition, then extend the Mac partition.\nJust deleting the linux partition will leave the Mac one as is - partitions don't auto-expand.\nKey steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the partition you wish to change.\n\n*Use the ‘Size’ field to set a size for the partition. The size is entered in GB (gigabytes).\n\n*Press the tab or enter key on your keyboard to see a visual display of the resulting partition changes.\n\n*You can also interactively adjust partition sizes by dragging the small indicator positioned between each partition.\n\n*When you’re satisfied with your partition sizes, formats, and names, click the ‘Apply’ button.\n\n\nThis has the details: https://www.lifewire.com/partition-macs-hard-drive-disk-utility-2260077\n\nA: Let me preface this answer by saying that anytime you are making changes to the partition table, you should consider making a backup of all relevant data (documents, pictures, music, application data, etc.).  This change to the partition table only becomes challenging when you are making changes to the boot loader, which you are not doing.\n", "Q: How do I add music files to my iPhone without iTunes?

Songs are added to some database, thats why you can't just put your song there and expect it appear in your Music.\nWhat you can is to use 3rd party apps (music apps, I guess), that have access to their documents from a computer (since iOS 8.3 users are not allowed to access documents of any application). But then you will need to listen your music in that app you used. \n", "Q: AppleScript to set clock I need to set the Mac clock to a specific date and time, to perform some testing.\nI'm new to AppleScript. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to write a double-clickable script to set the clock?( By “double-clickable”, I mean a script that appears to be an app, double-click from the Finder to launch, run, and quit. No need to open the AppleScript environment/tools. ) \n\n*Does anyone care to post some example code?\n\nA: The follow example AppleScript code uses the state of the NTP Daemon to toggle the Date/Time settings between two Date/Time states. By default, ntpd is running and needs to be turned off if a changed Date/Time is to stay and move forwards normally from that point. Otherwise, with ntpd running, the Date/Time will be reset to the correct values rather quickly.\nYou can save this AppleScript code as an application and when run, does one of two things after entering the proper credentials. It either sets the Date/Time to the values specified, or turns the NTP Daemon back on so the system will update the Date/Time to the correct values.\nset ntpdPID to do shell script \"pgrep ntpd; exit 0\"\nif ntpdPID is not \"\" then\n    do shell script \"systemsetup -setusingnetworktime Off -setdate '01:24:1984' -settime '03:00:00'\" with administrator privileges\nelse\n    do shell script \"systemsetup -setusingnetworktime On\" with administrator privileges\nend if\n\nThis is the no fills version and the code can be modified as needed/wanted, however, since those needs/wants have not been defined, this is all I can offer.\n\nA: @user3439894 I had to modify your code to work on Mojave. ntpd is no longer being used, and apparently disabling the networktime and setting the time have to be done as 2 separate commands.\nset ntpdPID to do shell script \"systemsetup -getusingnetworktime; exit 0\" with administrator privileges\nif ntpdPID is \"Network Time: On\" then\n    do shell script \"systemsetup -setusingnetworktime off\" with administrator privileges\n    do shell script \"systemsetup -setdate '01:24:1984' -settime '03:00:00'\" with administrator privileges\nelse\n    do shell script \"systemsetup -setusingnetworktime on\" with administrator privileges\nend if\n\nHope this helps someone.\n", "Q: Extracting Data from a Broken Hard Drive I need to extract data from a Hard Drive of a 2011 MBP that usually won't boot because of a seemingly broken drive. The computer booted on some attempts, but it usually shows a gray question mark logo and holding CMD+R boots internet recovery.\nThe MBP can be booted through an external USB hard drive with a copy of OS X installed on it, but only the external drive does shows up in Disk Utility.\nI think it can be concluded that the main hard drive is damaged. This can further be supported by the fact that the SATA/SATA Express tab in the system report shows Unknown under the first Intel 7 Series Chipset where the Hard Drive is meant to show up. Is there any way to extract data from this hard drive? Are there any special tools necessary? If so, then are they cheaper than bringing the laptop to the service shop?\n\nA: At this stage it is normally not a job for amateur to extract data from the drive.\nIf you highly value the data on the drive, I wouldn't recommend bringing it to a standard service shop, as they wouldn't have the means to do anything. I would hire a specialized data recovery company to recover the data.\nIf you have no such option, one of the cheapest and easiest ways to recover after such a problem is to replace the electronics on the drive. Buy a 100% identical hard drive (new or used), replace the PCB on the old drive with the PCB from the new drive. If this works, copy over your data straight away to a backup drive.\nNote: This only fixes some types of disk errors. If for example the drive heads or platters themselves are damaged, replacing the PCB won't help. But it also means that you have to have very special tools and facilities to be able to read data from the drive.\n", "Q: Restoring iOS apps (+data) that weren't transfered to PC before iPhone backup I recently performed a backup of my iPhone, but forgot to transfer my purchases to my PC before restoring from the backup. A couple apps had some data I'd really hate to lose. To make things worse, the backup is apparently corrupted, and the only solution seems to be paying 30$ for a program that can repair it.\nIf I were to pay to have it repaired, will I be able to recover all the app data from what was installed at the time the backup was performed? Can I just download the apps in question to my iTunes library, and the backup will have the appropriate data to restore to my iPhone?\nHopefully someone has precise info on this; it would be much appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: Full disclosure: I'm the lead developer of the repair software you're most likely referring to ;)\nThe data for the apps are stored in the backups, just not the apps themselves. Normally, the apps should be downloaded again automatically from the app store after you restore and setup (logging in to your app store account/AppleID). You don't have to have the apps themselves transferred into iTunes in order for their data to be in the backup.\nSo yes, normally if you repair it, the apps should reinstall, and the data for those apps should be there waiting after the restore. In the rare event (but does happen) that the app data that you need was part of what was broken in the backup, that's why we offer a guarantee with our software :)\n", "Q: How to write an AppleScript that downloads Wi-Fi network status from router's web interface? Objectives:\nI want to create an AppleScript .scpt file that does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Accesses a router's webpage (i.e., its IP address).\n\n*From this webpage, gets the IP addresses that are currently connected to both networks. (By \"both networks\", I refer to the separate 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz wireless networks.)\n\n*From the webpage, gets the respective Dbm signal strengths of each connected device (i.e., each connected IP address).\n\nImplementation:\nI want one AppleScript list object to contain all of the IP addresses: \n\n\n*\n\n*E.g.: theListOfIPs contains {\"192.168.0.1\", \"192.168.0.\", \"192.168.0.3\", \"192.168.0.4\", \"192.168.0.5\", \"192.168.0.6.\", \"192.168.0.7\"}.\n\n\n(I do not have the need to differentiate between the IPs that are connected to the 2.4GHz network and the IPs that are connected to the 5.0GHz network. All IPs should simply be contained in theListOfIPs.)\nAnd, one AppleScript list object to contain their corresponding signal strengths:\n\n\n*\n\n*E.g.: theListOfTheirSignalStrengths contains {\"0\", \"-75\", \"-40\", \"0\", \"0\", \"-63\", \"-72\"}.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would like all of this to be completed \"behind the scenes.\" Unobtrusiveness is really key, because the script will need to periodically check the router's website for network updates.\n\n*Ultimately, changes to the network status will be written to a .txt log file, and an alert notification will be displayed, when certain conditions are met. I know how to code these components; I need help actually importing the data into the script.\n\n*Browser of choice: Google Chrome\n\nBackground:\nI have used the shell command , curl, before, in order to import the unabridged HTML source code of a given website into an AppleScript, as a text object. I understand that, sadly, one cannot similarly or conveniently get all JavaScript elements into an AppleScript as a single text object.\nInstead, one must get each and every JavaScript element individually, by some identifier, like its id, class, tag, or name.

There seems to be a possible fix by moving some system files around. \nHowever, to do this, I have to disable SIP protection. \nTo disable SIP, i have to boot up in recovery mode.\nMacBook won't boot up in recovery mode - grey screen of death\nMacBook can boot up in single user mode however.\nThere are tales that you can boot in single user recovery mode by holding down command-R-S on boot, but that did not work for me.\nWhat can i do?\n\nA: You can't, and that's by design. If an attacker could disable system protection while the OS was booted it'd be pointless. If you find something, please file a radar because this is an important security component. Single user mode is the same as normal OSX just stopped a bit before a bunch of niceties load, so no dice there. You'll have to get into recovery mode somehow and if you can't even boot to single user recovery you might have a bigger issue than just GPUs. \nYou could, potentially, boot using an eGPU if I understand the issue. Issue is an eGPU is hard to find and more expensive to buy than just fixing your laptop.\n", "Q: iPad got slow, missing drive space I got an iPad 4th gen from 2012 with 16 GB space. It's in use daily.\nFor a few months now we have seen the iPad becoming more and more slow. Like, the Safari browser doesn't get up in under 10 seconds.\nAlso, when I start a game the game crashes saying \"no space left on device\". But in reality, there is more than 1 GB left.\nI believe my flash drive is somehow broken. It shows me a total capacity of 13,05 GB instead of 16. I know, you may never see the full size, but missing 3 gigs feels a bit much.\nAny ideas what I can do with this iPad to make it work nicely again or at least analyze what is going on?\n\nA: Part of the 16GB is taken up by iOS. The system usage screen won't show a category for the OS itself because there's nothing you can do about it.\nYour device is coming up on about five years old. Modern device will perform much better on a more resource intensive OS. You could try a restore but really I think it's just that the new features and technologies aren't well optimized or are simply too much for it.\n", "Q: How can I make iTerm2 *cd* into a directory by clicking on *ls* results? Would it be possible to make some sort of remap where command-clicking or highlighting some text in the terminal triggers iTerm2 to attempt to cd <text>? Would make life somewhat easier when navigating around complex directory trees with long names.\nI found these instructions for making command-click trigger an action on the clicked filename or word. But after trying the Run command... option with cd \\1 (for \"cd to this clicked item\"), that doesn't seem to work.\n\nThe answer below evidently does not work on remote logins; if anyone has a solution that does so, I will accept your answer.\n\nA: I've found that you need to go Preferences -> Profiles -> Advanced -> Semantic History and use Run coprocess... and echo cd \\1 to get the desired result.\nDon't ask me why this works or how I found this solution.\n\n\nA: Here's another approach that should work in remote sessions. Just create the keyboard remap as shown below (go to iTerm2...Preferences...Keys and click on the \"Plus\" sign, then select \"Paste from Selection...\" from the drop-down menu for \"Action\"). Take note of the Replace...With fields.\nThis way, we can double click on an item to highlight it and press the magic keyboard shortcut. We've now cd'd into a directory without having to type out its name.\n\nIt would be possible to do this with a Pointer action instead of a keyboard shortcut, but unfortunately, the Pointer section does not have the same detailed options for \"Paste from Selection\". Perhaps this will change in a future release.\n", "Q: Terminal not recognizing imacro:// as protocol, thinks it's a pathname I'm trying to run this from the terminal:\nopen /Applications/Firefox.app imacros://run/?m=macro.iim\n\nThis gives me the error\nThe file /Users/dave/Desktop/watch-nodejs/imacros:/run/?m=macro.iim does not exist.\n\nThe expected result is to open firefox and type \"imacros://run/?m=macro.iim\" in the url bar. This works on mac and windows, but for some reason mac thinks \"imacros://run/?m=macro.iim\" is a path to a file on my computer\n\nA: Use\nopen /Applications/Firefox.app --args 'imacros://run/?m=macro.iim'\n\nto prevent open from messing with the argument. Also quoting might help to stop the shell from stumbling over any special characters (not really required in this specific case).\n", "Q: How can I count all words or characters in a Powerpoint pptx file? Is there a simple way to count the characters of all text fields in a Powerpoint presentation?\nI tried exporting to Rich Text Format (.rtf) to do the count in MS Word, but the export function only exports some text fields (outline text) and misses small annotations, lists, etc.\nSome tools like Count Anything or Anycount are not available for Mac OSX.\n\nA: No, the way is not at all simple. Specifically, the file format is complicated so analyzing the file won’t get a quick answer.\nTo answer your question, it's helpful to know that the .pptx format is actually a zip file full of .xml files. I found folders called slide1.xml, slide2.xml, etc... but there are many others and the text within them is surrounded by the usual xml formatting tags.\nYou can unzip by replacing .pptx in the filename with .zip (you may have to enable visible extensions) and unzipping with something like Keka. I've had trouble unzipping with the native Mac OSX Archive utility, but Keka has always worked for me.\nFor more detail, see this page: Your slide deck is a zip file in disguise\n\nA: Does the built-in count not work?\nFind the word count of your PowerPoint 2016 for Mac presentation\n", "Q: Macro software on iPad I wanna have a background software than can press a certain spot when the notification appears immediately. Is there any app that can do that? Or can I manually write an app and execute it on my iPad?\n\nA: No it is not possible.

I use VS code quite a lot, but you can use Sublime, Atom, etc.\nAs for IDE, I recommend to try JetBrains Rider instead of VS for mac. Unfortunately, it has only trial. It provides same functionality as VS for mac.\n\nA: In April 2017, Microsoft released Visual Studio for Mac. Visual Studio Community is free for students, open-source and individual developers.\nIt supports development of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mobile with .NET: Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS\n\n*Mac desktop apps\n\n*.NET applications (in C# and F# by default)\n\n*ASP.NET Web applications\n\n*Cross-platform Unity games\n\n\nMinimum Requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS El Capitan 10.11\n\n*Xcode 8.2\n\n*An Apple ID (for signing into Xcode)\n\n\nFor iOS development, macOS Sierra 10.12 and Xcode 8.3 are required.\n\nA: The Mono project maintains a cross-platform C#/.net environment which works well on macOS. \nhttp://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/osx/\n\nA: I recommend Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's an official Microsoft product, so it should run C# quite well. When you have it installed, click on the last large button in the sidebar to get extensions, and search for C#. (There's also a Windows version.)\n\nA: I have been running the new Beta of Visual Studio for Mac on my new M1 pro max MacBook and it works well. I have also preferred the UI and run-times of CodeRunner 4, which is available through the App Store and allows running a variety of different languages.\nI have only really used C# in it, but it’s error detection and corrections are very similar to VS, just no direct links to the Microsoft C# doc’s, but that isn’t difficult to work around!\n", "Q: Looking for a screen measuring app for macOS I need an app to be able to measure distances at the very least that would correspond to real values. Let's say I have a graphic that has a few points on it instead of having to print out the paper and measure the distances between points by ruler, I'd like to do it on screen. \nCould you suggest the best on screening measuring tool that there is? If it would come with other tools it would be really great.\n\nA: Cmd-shift-4 brings up a screen capture utility. As you move the new cursor it displays the number of pixels you move in x and y directions. So you can easily measure pixel distance between 2 points. You don't have to capture the screen area, just opt out of that option.\nI've also used the app PixelStick ($7 but free trial) that brings up a screen measuring tool. It lists current pixel, the distance between pixels, and the angle between two pixels. You can calibrate the pixel distance to other scales and has a built in map mode. It also has a screen capture button and a color grabber.\n\nA: Xscope is an awesome screen measuring app. It has different modes and will probably do everything that you want.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s battery draining when in Airplane AND Sleep AND Low-power modes together, as if I am using it My iPhone 5s battery is being drained very fast when in sleep mode (30-40% over night). I put it in airplane mode and in low power mode, and it still drains very fast in sleep mode. The battery however is fine during the day, lasts about 3/4 of my day when I use it.\n\nA: It's possible that the battery health has degraded over time. I would recommend you install Battery Life in your iPhone to check the battery health.\nIf the battery health is below 80%, then you should consider replacing the battery. I replaced my iPhone 5's battery after 3-4 years after it hit 65% battery health. You should do the same. I was able to find a 3rd party battery and replace it myself. The process took me 30-40 mins. Also, go to the Battery section in the Settings app and see which apps are the biggest battery users. \n", "Q: Numbers: Creating a Summary table based on values from different table I have a table that looks much like this:\n\nThat Category column is entered manually and will have several duplicated values.\nI’d LOVE to be able to create a “Summary” table that manages to copy and manipulate some of this data. Namely:\n\n\n*\n\n*It would take the “Category” columns with its duplicates, remove duplicated and sort the list;\n\n*Have a second column that sums all values in that category’s fields;\n\n*And finally, have a third row that shows how many times the original keywords appeared in the first table.\n\n\nHere is a screenshot of what I’m trying to achieve:\n\nPossible??\n\nA: If your category column contains categories that are correctly spelled each time, then a simple solution would be to use the SUMIFS() and the COUNTIFS() formulas.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Summary table, add a category from the category column from the Finances table.\n\n*Next, in the Amount column of your Summary table, add the following formula: SUMIFS(2017 Finances::Amount,2017 Finances::Category,A2) Where A2 contains a unique category.\n\n*In the Count column, use this formula: COUNTIFS(2017 Finances::Category,A2)\n\n*Drag the formulas down the columns to fill for each category.\n\n*Sort Ascending or Descending as desired.\n\n\nThe SUMIFS and COUNTIFS compare the category column with the entry in the Summary table's entry.  If there is a match, it sums or counts based on the category.  Repeat as needed.\nNOTE:\nDynamically creating a Summary table without knowing the categories is quite a bit more complicated as Numbers does not have Pivot Table (as Excel or Google Sheets has) functionality as of the date this answer was posted.

If that works for your specific keyboard, you can use it - if not, you’ve already got the fastest method of disabling Bluetooth entirely.\n\nA: Long press the arrow in the keyboard menu bar (or whatever this thing is called) to bring up the keyboard:\n\n\nA: The solution to this is to add a mouse to the iPad and enable 'Show Onscreen Keyboard'\nI had to do this to some iPads in a Kiosk with an RFID scanner attached so the onscreen keyboard would go away. I couldn't figure out a way to do it my config profile.\nI guess Apple's thinking is that if you want to use mouse with iPad you'd want to use the mouse to 'type' with the Onscreen Keyboard.\n\nA: Although this is an old thread, I’m sharing this with you - just in case it’ll help somebody:\nIf you’re using an Apple wireless keyboard, you can use the eject (top right) button to show up / hide the virtual keyboard. To switch input language, use the \"Fn\" (bottom left) button.\nSince this is very helpful and since iPad pro Smart Keyboard is probably the most expensive keyboard in the world, this key is of course missing on it..\nGreat, especially because as far as I know there not no other way to start dictation (microphone button)...\n\nA: The logitech combo touch keyboard for the iPad actually has a button in the top row to call up the keyboard on the screen.

Because I have a poor internet each time I try to restore and update, downloading iOS 10.3.3 fails.\nIs there a way to restore it without using my internet?\nCheers,\n\nA: Afraid not, but I feel your struggle. My internet is about as terrible as it gets (14kb/s). However, I was able to download the IPSW using my PS3's Internet browser which seems to get 700kb/s and it took slightly over one hour.

In it is a 4 GB Photo Library named Photos Library.photoslibrary. I have iCloud Photo Library turned on, and it has been on for more than a year.\nWhy do I have this 4 GB photo library on my iMac? Shouldn't all photos be in iCloud? Can I delete it or should I just leave it?\n\nA: Leave it. Photos still needs to download your Photos when you decide to view them. It will either download a device-optimized or full-resolution copy depending on your chosen settings.\nThink of this file as a local cache of your photo library, although it also contains other things that are not stored in iCloud, such as Smart Albums and facial recognition data. If you delete this file Photos will need to recreate it and rebuild your library from iCloud data. In particular, it will need to re-download thumbnails for all of your photos.\nThe idea is that if you do run low on storage, Photos will start purging photos you haven’t viewed in a while, in albums you haven’t specifically marked as Download Originals to this Mac.\n", "Q: How do I add loyalty cards to the iOS wallet? Is there any way to add loyalty cards to the iOS wallet? I'm talking about those mini keyring cards.

Forget it. \nAnd these loyalty card and wallet enhancing apps all seem rather sketchy. \n\nA: I use PassSource, and it's very handy!\nYou don't need to download any apps or even create an account. You just use your iOS device to go to their website, input information about your loyalty card/coupon/ticket/etc., and tap \"Add to Apple Wallet\".\n", "Q: What's the maximum necessary size in pixels for a video for iPhone? I'm exporting MOVs from Flash, then converting them to mp4 with Handbrake. The video will scale to the screen size, but I would prefer it to scale down, rather than  scale up. \nSo, what are the optimum pixel width and height of a MOV/mp4 for iPhones? By \"optimum\", I mean the maximum needed to display 1:1 on the highest definition iPhone screen. \nI know iPhone screen sizes have changed with each new iPhone, and screen sizes come in points, rendered pixels, physical pixels and physical devices.

But Apple is now rejected my latest app as spam\nApple message:\n\nGuideline 4.3 - Design - Spam\nWe noticed that your app provides the same feature set as other apps\nyou've submitted to the App Store; it simply varies in content or\nlanguage, which is considered a form of spam.\nNext Steps\nWhen creating multiple apps where content is the only varying element,\nyou should offer a single app to deliver differing content to\ncustomers. Alternatively, you may consider creating a web app, which\nlooks and behaves similar to a native app when the customer adds it to\ntheir Home screen. Refer to the Configuring Web Applications section\nof the Safari Web Content Guide for more information.\nYou will experience a delayed review process if you deliberately\ndisregard the App Store Review Guidelines, ignore previous rejection\nfeedback in future app submissions, or use your app to mislead or\ndeceive users.\nImportant Information\nAs a result of violating this guideline, your app’s review has been\ndelayed. Future submissions of this app, and other apps associated\nwith your Apple Developer account, will also experience a delayed\nreview. Deliberate disregard of the App Store Review Guidelines and\nattempts to deceive users or undermine the review process are\nunacceptable and is a direct violation Section 3.2(f) of the Apple\nDeveloper Program License Agreement.

You need to do what is listed under \"Next steps\" and/or communicate with the Apple review team to solve the issue, primarily\n\nWhen creating multiple apps where content is the only varying element, you should offer a single app to deliver differing content to customers\n\nBasically you're in violation of the guidelines as having multiple identical apps with only color theme variations is not allowed. You could instead create a single app where the user can select the color theme they wish if you agree with the characterization of multiple similar apps. \nIf you don’t agree then a chat with Dev support or a formal appeal would be your next step. \n", "Q: Trackpad not working MacBook Pro I am having issue with my trackpad of MacBook Pro Retina early 2015, As it was working properly a day before, the Hardware Keyboard and other things working properly. \nI did tried Reseting SMC, PRAM, but no luck, I am on macOS Sierra 10.12.6.\nAny suggestions? \n\nA: I would start with the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Select the Trackpad preferences pane\n\n*Check your various settings under each of the tabs\n\n\nIf nothing there resolves the issue, then try booting into Safe Mode to see whether booting into Safe Mode makes a difference, either during or afterwards.\nNOTE: Before proceeding below I recommend disconnecting any external devices (e.g. keyboard, mouse, etc). This also includes Bluetooth devices as well as USB.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. does your trackpad work, etc)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Again, take a note of what happens (i.e. does your trackpad work, etc)\n\n\nNow, if after you've gone through the above steps you find that:\n\n\n*\n\n*your trackpad works during Safe Mode but not when you're logged back in normally, let me know.\n\n*it isn't working during Safe Mode at all, then it's time to test your hardware with Apple Diagnostics (see below).\n\n\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n\nA: Try to press firmly on touchpad itself and palm area of the MacBook few times. If after that touchpad will come back to life, then most probably you have problem with the battery. You'll need to replace it in a service center. I had similar problem with my MB.\n\nA: Try to get any mouse and go to system preferences by clicking on the apple logo in the top left. Then go to accesability then mouse and track pad. If you have \"mouse keys\" enabled uncheck it then you should be alright. If this is not the issue and you have tried everything else then you might have a hardware issue.\n", "Q: How to copy a book from iBooks with highlighting? I have a book on my iMac at work which has highlighting all over the book. But when I put the book in my Dropbox and open it on my MacBook at home there are no highlights.

If not, log in.\n\n*Depending on your version of macOS you need to check the check mark for Documents & Settings.\n\n*In iBooks.app sign in to the same iCloud account it you aren't already.\n\n*Make sure that the ePub file is the very same on both Macs.\nPrepare your MacBook\n\n\n*\n\n*Repeat the steps above that you did for your iMac.\n\n\nSync your highlightings\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot both Macs\n\n*Open the ePub in iBooks.app on your iMac and add a note or a bookmark.\n\n*Close the ebook in iBooks.app but leave iBooks.app running.\n\n*Open the ePub on your MacBook with iBooks.app. Wait for the highlightings/bookmarks/notes to appear. It may take a few minutes for the first time.\n\n*If they don't appear on your MacBook, add a new highlighting/bookmark.\n\n\n\nPlease note\nIf possible, you should run the same versions of macOS on both Macs. Also check for available software updates.\nUsing the same Apple iCloud account is necessary for the synchronization to work with Apple's iBooks.app. You can't use another cloud storage provider for this.\nUnfortunately there is no other way to sync them other than to re-add your edits by hand.\n", "Q: MS RDP client minimum iOS version on Apple iPad Kinda new to Apple world so need some clarification here: does official MS RDP client support older iPads or no?\nOn the official app page they say that minimum required iOS version is 8.0, but in these Getting Started docs they state that iOS 6 is supported too. So I'm a bit confused with what to believe?\nWill I be able to use RDP client on older iPads with iOS 4 or iOS 5?\n\nA: I would trust the Apple reviewers that iOS 8.0 is the minimum required.\nAlso, I would also plan on not buying any hardware that is 32 bit since we’re so close to iOS 11 and no more 32 bit apps.\nMicrosoft’s support is actually pretty amazing for iOS - so you could ask them if they plan on leaving older versions of the app available. Developers don’t have to take down all downloads when they remove an app version from sale. So you could buy the app “for free” now and then ride an iOS 8 or iOS 6 device for years by backing up the older app version to iTunes and/or counting on it being available for “legacy download”.\nThere’s no guarantee they keep the old version up, so you should plan on iTunes and buying new hardware if you are riding the “about to be obsoleted” line for used / older iOS hardware and versions.\n", "Q: RSS readers and malware I recently had an issue where some RSS feeds were causing my IT department to think my MBP was infected by ransomware and was connecting to a ransomware server.\nRansomware/malware can be 'caught' just by visiting a compromised website so one would like to think RSS readers, mine is Vienna, block the execution of all code in the pages they load. Is that so? My discussion on Vienna's GitHub page was far less than satisfactory on the matter.\nSo two things.  The first is to bring this issue to people -- I had no idea my RSS reader could be a potential source of exposure to malware.  RSS readers offer convenience, but apparently I need now to balance that convenience with the potential risks associated with malware.  I believe not many people are thinking of this issue and they might benefit from being aware of it.\nTwo, is there a way of sandboxing a RSS reader (ideally in the most complete way), so that it cannot be a source of malware?  is disabling JavaScript and plugins in the RSS browser enough (not really clear what plugins the internal browser has to start with...)?  \n\nA: I'm sorry you felt the response you got on the Vienna GitHub page wasn't satisfactory. The issue was caused by a compromised web server that was serving you an RSS feed and also performing a normal HTTP request to a ransomware site.\nTo add an answer to your second item, disabling JS and plugins in the internal browser should be more than enough. Attempting to reach a ransomeware site isn't a security issue in itself.\nFor Sandboxing, Vienna was patched in November 2016 (see https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss/issues/736) to prevent an XML exploit that allowed a malicious RSS feed to potentially read files outside of the application. \nWe hope to add the macOS native sandboxing in the future and that is an issue that is high on our list of improvements to make to Vienna and hopefully won't be outstanding for too much longer. \n", "Q: Creating a Linux boot drive on a MAC for a Kangaroo Mobile pC install I was trying to use your method to create a USB on my Mac for a Linux boot USB to install linux on a Kangaroo mobile pc.

If you are using instructions from a Linux site, they are most likely providing the instructions for doing this on Linux (not macOS) using X as a variable for the specific identifier since the identifier can be different for each user and/or instance as the device is removable.\n\n\nIn Linux it's /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc.  In macOS/BSD is /dev/disk1, /dev/disk2, etc.\nAlso (thanks to user3439894 via comments) you need to make sure you disk is unmonted but not ejected.  Do this by issuing the command diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX where X is the number of your disk identifier.\n", "Q: Really Strange Behaviour on Trackpad/Keyboard Macbook Pro / Sierra /Model 1502\n\n\n*\n\n*My Touchpad stopped clicking.

What is the root cause of this weird behaviour.\np.s. I have tried all kinds of reboots.\n  * Command+Option+P+R\n  * Option+Control+Shift\n\nA: This happens all the time for various reasons.

Then verify that you only pair or connect one device at a a time. \n\nif one device has left mouse pressed down, you can’t ever get a left mouse up event from any other device.\n\nBluetooth interference or less commonly, faulty usb devices can overload the communications channel and you can isolate this by connecting devices one by one. \nWhy can't I left click on my Macbook Pro?\nThe last two times I had this affect me was a second Magic Trackpad pinned under a book on a bookshelf and an old but reliable (up to when it failed) USB 2.0 hub. \n", "Q: Bash completions broken I am using following bash completions installed via brew:\nbash-completion\nbash-completion@2\n\nMy .bashrc looks like:\nif [ -f /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then\n. /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion\nfi\n\n\nif [ -f /usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion ]; then\n  BASH_COMPLETION=/usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion\n  . /usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion\nfi\n\nThe problem is when I press TAB on an empty prompt on keyboard I get the error:\n-bash: words: bad array subscript\nAfter removing /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion from .bashrc error doesn’t happen but I miss out on many completions.\nWhat is the problem here? How can I fix it?\n\nA: The solution is that I should call bash completion from 1.3.2 before bash-completion@2. Following is how my .bashrc looks, and this solves the problem:\nif [ -f /usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion ]; then\n  BASH_COMPLETION=/usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion\n  . /usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion\nfi\n\nif [ -f /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then\n    . /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion\nfi\n\n", "Q: How Do You Launch The Finder Process in Terminal Is it possible to start the Finder process from Terminal? If so, what would be the command?\n\nA: Simple:\nopen /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app\n", "Q: Should I erase Website data in settings? I'm trying to track down why my battery is running down so quickly on my iPhone 6s. Is it okay to erase Safari Website Data?\n\nA: It is perfectly safe to delete Website Data, although that is unlikely to solve your battery life issues. Website Data only include things such as cookies and webpage caches.\nIf anything, your phone will have to work a little harder to redownload images, log you back in to websites, etc. the first time you visit each site after wiping Website Data.\n", "Q: LDAP user VNC screen sharing suddenly broke. Other LDAP users work, local admin works I have a Mac (macOS Sierra 10.12.6) with a local admin user, a local non-admin user, and many LDAP users. One of the LDAP users can't login via VNC anymore, but can login via SSH.\nThe affected user can connect to the VNC port, and is prompted for a username/password.\n\nAfter the password is accepted, they are prompted to either request to view the display of the current user, or log in as themselves. They choose to log in as themselves.\n\nThen, they just see the Connecting to ... dialog and eventually it times out.\n\nOther LDAP users are able to login via VNC and SSH, and the local admin and non-admin users can login via VNC. This has affected the same user on two different boxes (both running the same version of macOS), so I'm guessing this is some kind of LDAP configuration issue, but I wasn't aware of any LDAP properties that controlled screen sharing access.\nWhat might have changed to cause one of my LDAP users to lose VNC?\n\nA: The LDAP user had changed their password, but their login keychain on this box still needed to be updated. Apparently, you can't log in via VNC if your login.keychain password and your account password don't match.\nI discovered this when I VNCed in as a different user, then logged out, and then tried to log in as the affected user. I was able to log in, but then I received a prompt saying:\n\nThe system was unable to unlock your login keychain.\n\n\nI chose Update Keychain Password, and entered the old LDAP password, and everything worked!\n", "Q: Accessing Disk Images on iOS Is it possible to mount and edit the contents of a .dmg file on an iPhone? I realize they are designed for macOS and larger computers of that ilk, but I'm curious if there's a workaround...\n\nA: To my understanding, the only workaround involves jailbreaking the iOS device. If you are willing to try that route, you might find this helpful: https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/4hgr0y/tutorial_mounting_a_dmg_on_ios/.\nIf not, I don't believe there is any other way to mount a .dmg on an iOS device.\n", "Q: Is there a way to enable HiDPI scaling for external monitors on MacOS? https://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/23/loss-of-resolution-scaling-macos-sierra-update/\nIs there a workaround to get HiDPI mode on external monitors on macOS Sierra? \n\nA: Use SwitchResX. It allows you to enable HiDPI mode. It also offers the possibility of \"faking\" a HiDPI mode by scaling (I use a fake 1080p HiDPI on my 2K thunderbolt display). No remarkable performance issues reported.\n", "Q: Meaning of lines in \"wcap\" that don't have a MAC, and are not \"beacon\" or \"wep\" broadcasts? After creating a wcap file with Wireless Diagnostics I used vim to inspect this file:\n\n$ tcpdump -r 2017.98.14_17-33-49-EDT.wcap > output.txt\n\nand then I removed all lines that had either of\n(1) a MAC address.\n(2) the \"beacon\" string.\n(3) the \"wep\" string.\nHere is a sample of what remained:  \n\n17:33:51.074520 4185535295us tsft -51dB signal -89dB noise antenna 0 5785 MHz 11a ht/40+ 65.0 Mb/s MCS 7 20 MHz (L) lon GI mixed BCC FEC [bit 20]\n  17:33:51.076525 4185537310us tsft short preamble 12.0 Mb/s 5785 MHz 11a -53dB signal -89dB noise antenna 0 BA RA:d4:b2:7a:39:f4:1e (oui Unknown)\n  17:33:51.289354 4185750140us tsft -53dB signal -87dB noise antenna 0 5785 MHz 11a ht/40+ 65.0 Mb/s MCS 7 20 MHz (L) lon GI mixed BCC FEC [bit 20]\n  17:33:51.611685 4186072156us tsft short preamble 6.0 Mb/s 5785 MHz 11a -79dB signal -87dB noise antenna 0 Action (a2:3a:de:12:fd:d5 (oui Unknown)): Vendor Act#0\n  ....\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Doesn't each line in wcap represent a packet?\n\n*If so, what type of packet is not a broadcast or does not have a MAC address?\n\n\nSince I made the effort to inspect my LAN (for other reasons), I'm just curious. Not really a big deal of course.\n\nA: Those remaining lines are very important metadata measured from the radio/baseband software to help troubleshooting issues with wireless that can crop up in cases of interference, lack of signal and to identify the hardware / media access layers of the network connection between the radio on your Mac and the radio on the access point.\nIn these specific lines, you have 802.11a (a less common protocol), and very good signal to noise ratios, the exact channel you are tuned in to and the basic data rate / encoding rate for the link between your Mac and the radio at the access point.\nThese data would be very helpful if you were seeing large numbers of errors or retransmits or didn’t know which base station you were connecting to.\n", "Q: Is there a Siri command for \"Get directions to my next event?\" I can say to Siri \"Get directions to the nearest post office\" and it will pull it up. However, sometimes I am on my way to an event that is in my calendar with the address. I would like to say \"Get directions to my next event\". However, that doesn't work as it pulls up event centers instead.\nIs there some other phrasing I can say to express what I want to Siri?\n\nA: This is impossible to do as of iOS 10.3.3. About the closest thing you can do is, \"Hey Siri where is my next appointment\", but there is no way to get directions from the address it spits out. \nWhat I'd recommend, instead of using Siri, is to create a widget in Workflow that will automatically grab the next event's location and give you directions. Note: I have never used Workflow to do this myself but I'm 99% sure it has all the various actions you would need to write a workflow to give you directions with one click.\nSorry you are unable to use Siri in this way and hopefully Workflow will accomplish what you're looking to do. \n", "Q: Wi-Fi only works in Recovery Mode I have a new MacBook Pro 2011 (wanted the ports). I recently just installed an SSD and decided to enable TRIM on it. My computer restarts and I have the gray Wi-Fi symbol and \"No Hardware Detected\". I do everything, resetting NVRAM, SMB, all of it.\nHowever, my Wi-Fi works when I boot into recovery mode. I have no idea why. Is there any fix for this?\nEDIT: FIXED BY RE-INSTALLING Sierra\n\nA: You may need to add the Wi-Fi service:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences → Network and choose + to add a service.\n\n*Choose Interface: Wi-Fi and Create.\n\n", "Q: Problem with \"csrutil enable --without debug\" on Sierra I am using a Mac on macOS Sierra 10.12.5.\nI want to run the app XtraFinder which opens some additional features in Finder. I used to have it on different computer, but when I download it on this one I got this error:\n\nSo I followed this link.\nWhen I run the csrutil enable --without debug command I got the error: \"unknown command without\".\nIs it something that I do wrong?\n\nA: You need to partially disable System Integrity Protection. I do not encourage you to disable System Integrity Protection. It makes your computer less safe.\nHow to partially disable System Integrity Protection\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Recovery OS by restarting your machine and holding down the cmd and r keys at startup\n\n*Launch Terminal from the Utilities menu\n\n*Enter the following command: csrutil enable --without debug\n\n*Reboot your computer\n\n\nA: As far as I could see (on High Sierra), it is the way \"csrutil\" works. If you invoke it like csrutil enable --without debug when not booted into Recovery OS and if you haven't done similar thing before, it will complain about \"--without\". However, if you boot into Recovery OS, it will work as expected.\nBtw, after you do this thing, csrutil enable --without debug (or any other supported argument for \"--without\") will be recognized (but won't work due to need to be executed from Recovery OS) even if not booted in Recovery OS.\n\nA: For everybody who still gets installation failures even with csrutil enable --without debug, here's the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Recovery OS by restarting your machine and holding down the cmd and r keys at startup\n\n*Launch Terminal from the Utilities menu\n\n*Enter the following command: csrutil disable\n\n*Reboot your computer\n\n*Install XtraFinder by clicking the installer\n\n*Repeat steps 1+2, enter: csrutil clear, reboot.\n\n\nStep 3 completely disables your system integration protection. This should be no problem if you immediately put it back on place by the last step (step 6).\n\nA: For me, neither csrutil enable --without debug nor csrutil disable works, even after carefully implementing all the needed steps as described above. xtrafinder will only work while SIP is completely disabled. Any further thoughts?\n", "Q: Can running `yes > /dev/null` harm a Mac? I recently ran yes > /dev/null for a 3 minutes to drain my Mac's battery. During that time, the temperature rose to 72 °C and fans spun up to 4000 RPM. I immediately quit the process. \nShould I fear that has this damaged hardware or the logic board?\n\nA: The yes command simply repeatedly writes a string to stdout, the character y by default. Redirecting (>) it to /dev/null simply causes for the stream data to be forgotten. In other words this has no lasting effect on the persistent state of your computer, it is not a harmful command through this lens.\nSince the yes command writes a string to stdout without any constraint on the output speed, this will cause for the CPU to reach maximal utilization on one core. This is the cause of the processor temperature increase and associated fan speed increase.\nIn a modern machine, particularly a well designed one like an Apple laptop, the hardware will protect its self from overheating damage. First by increasing fan speed, then by decreasing processor clock speed, and ultimately by halting the processor. Without intentionally circumventing these features, your hardware did not overheat. The machine is fine. \nYou mentioned a temperature of 72 °C specifically. This is not a very high temperature for a CPU die. A modest mobile cpu, the i5-7260U, specifies a maximum permissible temperature of 100 °C. You can see the specification as T_Junction in the package specifications section of this page: http://ark.intel.com/products/97539/Intel-Core-i5-7260U-Processor-4M-Cache-up-to-3_40-GHz\n\nA: The instructions for yes have this little gem from the man page :\n\nUsing yes results in 100% processor usage, for this reason it is\n  rarely used other than for testing e.g. to max out a computer's CPU.\n\nWhich means, no, you will not have damaged your hardware. Using the yes command is a way of using all (i.e. 100%) of your CPU. The symptoms you experienced (i.e. a rise in temperature and the resulting increase in fan RPM) are to be expected under these circumstances.  Additionally, your CPU will \"throttle back\" and ultimately shut down if its thermal threshold is exceeded to prevent damage.\n\nA: Certainly as others have said: the CPU and kernel both have their own self-preservation strategies.\nI'll add some flavour concerning how yes uses computer resources.\nIt's worth distinguishing between the behaviour of BSD yes and GNU yes.\nmacOS is a BSD, so will use an (old) distribution of BSD yes.\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS (Darwin) yes source code\n\n*BSD yes source code\n\n*GNU yes source code\nA good discussion of the differences exists at How is GNU yes so fast?\nAnd a discussion of that discussion exists on the Hacker News thread of the same name.\nBSD/macOS yes really does just run puts(\"y\"); in a tight loop.\nGNU yes is… somewhat more serious. It has optimizations far beyond mere buffering of I/O.\n\nA: The sad truth is: this can \"Harm a Mac\".\nThe actual example given in the body for the question: this very likely did not harm the device. Granted.\nBut as a general answer to the question in the title:\nIt depends on which type of Mac we are talking about. The advice and reasoning given so far on this question or in the comments is not universally true and can be quite dangerous! There is too much trust and faith put into the mere belief that Apple hardware is just the best there is.\nIt is simply not true that Apple designs now or designed in the past all its systems to really not harm themselves through overheating. While it is true that this should not happen it is also true that it does happen. And did:\nThe prime example for this are the MacBook Pros, especially those from 2010-2012.\nWhile the Intel chip that is primarily stressed with yes on all threads for a prolonged time will throttle down, will handle high temperatures quite well and even the OS will kick in and ramp up kernel_task to do nothing useful except help cool down the machine, the discrete chip on the same heatpipe is the vulnerable counterpart there.\nStressing these systems needlessly, like with yes, hastens the RadeonGate graphics chip failure. There are numerous examples of questions to the most heavily effected 2011 8,2 on this very web-site.\nThis GPU failure is a thermal issue. There are even guides out there on how to kill the machine by simply running heavy 3D rendering or benchmarks for a time. These systems were advertised for but not suited for e.g. rendering or gaming. Class action lawsuits (only threatened) and Repair Extension Programs speak for themselves.\n", "Q: What should I consider before buying external monitor for my MBP? I'd like to buy an external monitor for my Retina MacBook Pro mid 2015 (2880x1800 native resolution). I have 2 Thunderbolts 2 ports. \nI have the following questions that need answers to help me choose the best product :\n\n\n*\n\n*What monitor size/resolution I should consider?\n\n*how will I Connect my mac to my monitor ? HDMI? Thunderbolt ?\n\n\nThanks, \n\nA: \nWhat monitor size/resolution I should consider?\n\nThis is entirely up to you.  What makes sense for you?  Determine what features/specifications are important, then your budget, and then start shopping.  This will always be a subjective decision\n\nhow will I Connect my mac to my monitor ? HDMI? Thunderbolt ?\n\nThis is less subjective; the question is, what does the monitor support?\nYour MacBook will have both mini DisplayPort and HDMI  meaning you can use either cable.  Which one you use is entirely up to you, but my recommendation is \n\n\n*\n\n*Go with DisplayPort as HDMI can be very flaky (just search this site for examples)\n\n*Use the port that matches your monitor - don't convert the signal.  I am a bit proponent of not converting display signals; converting introduces unreliability.  If you must convert a signal, use an active adapter. \n", "Q: Battery issue with Macbook pro retina I have a MacBook Pro Retina Early 2015 model, that I have owned for 2 years. It was working absolutely fine just yesterday (or the day before). I consulted an Apple authorized service center that said I needed to replace the battery but I was confused how could the battery die overnight. So I contacted another Apple authorized service center. They took in my laptop for diagnosis for a couple of days and told me that the \"topcase\" was faulty and needed to be replaced. Of course they are also charging a hefty sum of money for it.\nI have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is a topcase? (sorry i am slightly technologically challenged)\n\n*Is there any way around my problem. I really don't think I can afford a new top case.\n\n\nMy laptop works fine on AC power, it's just that it's not a laptop anymore if I always have to keep it plugged in.\nThanks for you help in advance.\n\nA: The top case (or Upper Case Assembly) is essentially the case that contains the keyboard and trackpad. In some models, when replacing the battery, Apple will replace this as well.\nIn terms of other ways around your problem, you could try resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) to see if that has any impact. To give this a try, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac\n\n*Unplug the power cable from your Mac\n\n*For 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the shiftcontroloption keys (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*After 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button \n\n*Plug in the power cable\n\n*Turn your Mac back on with the power button.\n\n", "Q: Traveling to US - Do I need to step up / down for Macbook Pro (2016) I live in the U.K. and I have a Macbook Pro (2016) which I purchased in Dubai.

If you are using Yosemite (10.10) or Mavericks (10.9), this game will not work.\n\nWe also see that it's capable of running on Sierra (10.12).  You should be able to upgrade to at least El Cap with no performance issues.\nTo address your specific questions:\n\nDoes Apple impose an operating system cap because her Mac is too old?\n\nYes.  In fact, with the release of Sierra, many vintage Macs were left out in the cold.\n\nIs it advisable to upgrade her operating system to the lastest\n  version, or would it be too much of a strain on her system resource?\n\nIt's not a requirement to upgrade unless you need to, but given your case that you wish to use a specific application (game), it's necessary.

After doing that, booting in safe mode results in a successful shutdown. However, shutting down with sudo shutdown -h now locks up just like a normal shutdown.\n\nI tried a new user with Admin privileges and it got the same hang.  I even tried shutdown from login screen after boot and never having logged in and it also hangs.\n\nHere are the non-Apple signed extensions:\n\n\n*\n\n*ACS6x: Version: 3.1.8\n\n*ATTOCelerityFC8: Version: 2.5.6\n\n*ATTOExpressSASHBA2: Version: 2.4.6\n\n*ATTOExpressSASRAID2: Version: 3.7.1\n\n*ArcMSR: Version: 1.3.7\n\n*BJUSBLoad: Version: 10.69.0\n\n*BJUSBMP: Version: 2.9.0 (The oldest one, last modified: 11/21/10)\n\n*CalDigitHDProDrv: Version: 2.1.2\n\n*Dropbox: Version: 1.8.1\n\n*EnergyDriver: Version: 2.0\n\n*HighPointIOP: Version: 4.3.2\n\n*HighPointRR: Version: 4.3.3\n\n*JMicronATA: Version: 1.1.6 (The second oldest, last modified: 5/22/12)\n\n*ProlificUsbSerial: Version: 1.6.0\n\n*PromiseSTEX: Version: 5.2.10\n\n*SoftRAID: Version: 5.5.2\n\n*SophosFileProtection: Version: 9.6.51\n\n*SophosWebProtection: Version: 9.6.50\n\n*fuse4x: Version: 0.9.2\n\n*heimdall: Version: 6.0\n\n\nA: Per @Allan, I decided to do a complete reinstall of the operating system and migrate my data back to it. This is what ultimately worked for me.  I backed up my machine and made an appointment at the genius bar.  I went to the genius store for my appointment and had them to reinstall the operating system and after reinstall I was able to use time machine to restore my data.  It took about an hour.  Since then, the machine shuts down properly.\n\nUpdating to Mac OS X High Sierra fixed the problem.  Computer now reboots properly.\n", "Q: iPad volume issues I seem to be having a strange problem with my iPad. The volume only sometimes works. The volume will be fully turned up and not muted, but it won't work. Then, without changing anything, a couple minutes later it will work. Or, I will try to FaceTime someone and I will not hear it ring on my end. Then when they answer, I can't hear them and they can't hear me. I'll try again a second after and it'll work again. It is never consistent though. \nIs there anything I can do to fix this? \n\nA: maybe a setting has been changed, reset all settings and content or just all settings. after check the headphone plugs. as a last resort go to an apple store and tell them what is happening. 99% of the time they will fix it\n", "Q: Transfering music from external hard drive to iphone (without copying to disk) I have a large collection of mp3s (a backup of my old itunes from another computer) and I want to copy this to my new IPhone. \nTrouble is that my Mac is almost out of HD space, so I somehow want to copy the music directly from the external disk to the iPhone.

Well first we need to go over how computer hardware works. \n\nFollowing was active at lid closing time: Mail, Skype, Chrome (with 10 tabs)\n\nNote that software kept in the memory during sleep mode (when closing the lid) will use electricity because current day NAND Flash memory uses electricity to retain the information. This is a problem with NAND, unlike your Hard Drive or other technology currently under experimentation such as Milipede Memory or CBRAM, which all use permanent forms of data retention, DDR Memory requires electricity to exist. \nFor example, my 2008 MacBook hand-me down is still working find in 2017 albeit it will go from 100% to 25% in 24hrs due to the cycle count of the battery and the drainage caused by the memory and occasional wake-ups from LAN pings or whatever else. It's the second battery we've installed but I'm happy with the dual core on the go. If you were to plug an electric meter into your wall outlet and then plug an iMac into that, you would note even on sleep or \"Hibernate\" you will see minute amounts of power usage. The laptop actually shuts down it's cooling system with the lid closed unlike older iMacs that will often keep their cooling system powered.\nYour \"Activity Monitor\" app in the Utilities folder will allow you to see what software is using the most power, but a good practice is to shut down non-essential software before closing the lid. Do not plug in the laptop overnight IF it has a Lithium Ion battery, those batteries prefer micro-charges and keeping them \"topped up\" will stress them out, similar to your phone battery. Check your battery type for proper maintenance or \"treatment\" of the battery for the best battery life. :) \n", "Q: Writing bash scripts for changing Mac OS / OSX settings? I am not sure if I am asking this question properly, but I am trying write a script to change some settings on Mac OS Sierra, similar to this script which sets the clock in the menubar to appear as analog:\nkillall Dock;\ndefauls write com.apple.menuextra.clock IsAnalog -bool true;\nkillall SystemUIServer;\n\nInstead, I would like to select a different keyboard layout which I have created using Karabiner elements, which also appears in the menubar, and I can change it using the mouse. \nMy question is basically, how can I figure out what commands to put in my script to make changes like this? Is there a way to record commands that are run when making mouse actions, and then simply paste those commands into a script and alias it to some shortcut? Any help on how to become proficient writing scripts like this would be helpful. \n\nA: For scripting that interacts directly with macOS, you're much better off writing AppleScript over shell. AppleScript is Apple's proprietary scripting language that contains many ways to interact with the operating system. In addition, AppleScript was designed to be a very human readable language. \nPlenty of documentation and tutorials for AppleScript can be found through a quick google search. Here are some Apple webpages to get you started:\nIntroduction to AppleScript\nAppleScript fundamentals \nTo write AppleScripts, open up Script Editor, located in Applications > Utilities. \nAn example script to toggle macOS Sierra's dark mode, would be:\ntell application \"System Events\"\ntell appearance preferences\n    if dark mode is false then\n        set dark mode to true\n    else\n        set dark mode to false\n    end if\nend tell\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Easy way to copy paste file paths on Macs I am working on some long procedures that will need to reference a lot of file paths of documents located locally and on various external drives and servers. In all cases we are using Apple Macs with either El Capitan or Sierra installed.\nMy problem - it is taking me a long time to manually type and double-check the file paths are correct.\nPreferred solution - I would love it if there was just a way to copy and paste the file paths into these procedures.\nI did try using the Get Info option, but couldn’t see a file path listed anywhere that I could copy and paste.\nI also read this question: Get components (path and filename) of POSIX filepath and did have a go of using the script. This was promising, but it doesn’t quite do what I need.\nIs there an easy way for me to just copy and paste file paths as I need them? \nFor example, if I have an image called “Serial Number.jpg” located on an external drive called Server1 the file path would be: /Volumes/Server1/Serial Number.jpg.\n\nA: I think this is an option that will do exactly what you want. Using your Serial Number.jpg example, do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder browse to the image called “Serial Number.jpg” located on Server1\n\n*Right-click on the file to display the context menu\n\n*Now press and hold the option key down\n\n*Select the Copy “Serial Number.jpg” as Pathname option\n\n*Now go to the procedure you’re editing and paste the pathname you just copied\n\n\nThis should result in your document having the /Volumes/Server1/Serial Number.jpg path pasted into it.\nJust use the same steps for any file, regardless of whether it’s stored locally, on an external drive, or on a server. This also works to get the file path of folders.\nKeyboard shortcut\nThanks to Mateusz Szlosek for pointing out you can also use a keyboard shortcut. Instead of Steps 2 to 4 above, once you've selected the file you can use the option+command+C shortcut to copy the file path. Then you can paste it as usual.\nWindows etc files\nThere are custom built utilities to format shares for other operating systems and sub/afp as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*PathSnagger 2 works very well for this\n\n\nA: I would preferable just drag & drop a file into a text area to get its path (see Tetsujin's answer)\nIf this does not work for you, consider writing a very small program in Qt. \nFrom http://qtsimplify.blogspot.de/2013/01/drag-and-drop-files-into-your.html :\nCreate a new \"Qt Gui Application\" in Qt Creator. \nEdit the header file, mainwindow.h, by adding the following headers:\n#include <QDropEvent>\n#include <QUrl>\n#include <QDebug>\n\nReimplement the protected functions, dropEvent() and dragEnterEvent()\nprotected:\nvoid dropEvent(QDropEvent *ev);\nvoid dragEnterEvent(QDragEnterEvent *ev);\n\nIn the mainwindow.cpp, add these lines:\nvoid MainWindow::dropEvent(QDropEvent *ev)\n{\n    QList<QUrl> urls = ev->mimeData()->urls();\n    foreach(QUrl url, urls)\n    {\n        qDebug()<<url.toString();\n    }\n}\n\nvoid MainWindow::dragEnterEvent(QDragEnterEvent *ev)\n{\n    ev->accept();\n}\n\nThe dropEvent() function is where you recover the name of all the files you drop into your application. \nAnd lastly, add this line into your mainwindow constructor:\nsetAcceptDrops(true);\n\nThen, e.g. if you want to have the paths in the clipboard, you only need to copy them there using QClipboard \nQClipboard *clipboard = QGuiApplication::clipboard();\nclipboard->setText(url.toString());\n\nFor single file drops, and a list for all files.\n\nA: I use the Services Context Menu \"Path to Clipboard\" in Finder (although more often I use the Context Menu of QuollEyeTree).\nI am not sure if this is a default service, or one I created using Automator (mine is dated 2012), but it is trivial to create such a service, it it does not already exist.\n\nA: You can just drag & drop a file [or a whole swathe of them] into a text area to get its [their] path[s] - not in all apps but in many, including Terminal [& incidentally in the question/answer space on Stack Exchange too.]\nSome apps, like BBEdit, do not support this and take the contents of the file insteat of the full path. For these apps a Command 'drag & drop' works as well.\n\nA: A command line solution that I use for getting paths quickly is to use realpath from GNU Coreutils.  I have installled coreutils via MacPorts, where the binary is called grealpath.  You can then call it on a file and it will give you the path.  I like to mix it with pbcopy to quickly get a path into my clipboard: $ grealpath histograms.root | pbcopy\n\nA: There's an app on the app store called \"FilePath\" IIRC. Click on the file in the GUI then click on the filepath icon and select \"copy path\" from the menu. It can also copy multiple paths. If you're looking for something quicker I'd imagine you can assign a key combo to the action. \nI use this app on a regular basis to share synchronized cloud storage locations with coworkers.\n\nA: Get info (⌘i) of any file or folder.\nTriple click on Where under the General category to highlight the path.\n\nCopy (⌘c) this highlighted text and it will put the path on your clipboard.\nClose the window (⌘w)\nPaste wherever you need to use it (⌘v)\n\nA: In a finder window, you can select your file. If you have the gear-looking icon on your finder window you can hold down the option key and click that icon. One available option is to copy pathname. If selected it copies full pathname to the clipboard. You don't have to open the file.\n", "Q: How secure is File Vault 2 on Mac, given the fact that resetting/finding out someone's login password is not impossible?

Like you can press f6 in windows and it selects the first bookmark and if you follow by pressing enter it navigate to that page.\n\nA: This is not an exact solution to your question. However it is a good option you might like to try.  \nIf you enable enhanced dictation in system preferences as in the first image below:\n\nThen if you enable “Enable The Dictation Keyword Phrase” as the example in the following image..\n\nWhether or not you have dictation actively enabled, (and this will work in any application you are in) but in Google Chrome,  simply say the command “Computer Show Numbers“ then you will see something like this:\n\nCalling that  command “Computer Show Numbers“, Will visibly assign a number to every element of the application you are in.  At this point all you need to do is say the command “Computer Click 10” (or whatever number you want clicked) and voila!\nIf dictation is already actively running, it is not necessary to have to say “Computer…”\nJust say the command.  But if dictation is not running, saying the word “Computer” and then the command, Will make your computer start listening to what ever you say after saying “Computer”.  This makes it very easy to dictate commands to your computer if dictation is not actively running \n", "Q: Check log files for file transfer I would like if there is a way to capture in a log file all the transfer file activities in a given time period.

Let's say that on 16 Aug 2017 13:35 I copy/move a file/folder from my Mac to a usb device without giving any special arguments when using the cp/mv commands (in any case copying/moving files/folders can be achieved through GUI). \nIs there any text file on the Mac which records the activity history (such as copying/moving files/folders)? I would like this text file to include information in a way like:\n16 Aug 2017 13:35 path/to/folderA was copied to /path/to/usb/stick/ or something similar.\n\nA: You can manually use the Terminal command cp (copy) or mv (move) with the -v (for verbose) qualifier to keep a log of what is being copied. Verbose only shows file names, no dates.\nYou should look at man cp and man mv for more details.\nEx:\n\nIf you're looking for capturing log data for Finder drags, or disk activity from within apps, I'm not sure how that would be done.\n", "Q: How do I stop Messages from my iPhone 6s from appearing on my Mac?

This has obvious implications: if there's something you want to do in 15 minutes or 30 minutes, you don't have that option. You can only push the reminder to 5 minutes over and over, or push it a whole hour and risk not getting to it in time:\n\nOn iOS, its even worse. If a reminder pops up, a user can only choose between \"mark as completed\", \"remind me in 1 hour\", or \"remind me tomorrow\" with a hard press on the iPhone 7.\nI feel like Apple has decided that a reminder is for something to be done NOW (or in 5 minutes max) and doesn't want people postponing reminders in, say, 15 minute increments. If anything, it's Calendar time slots that might be marginally more immediate and fixed in time than reminders, aren't they? I think it's crazy to only have a choice between 5 minutes and a full hour to postpone our reminders, while being forced to go into the reminders app to manually change the time for each alert!\nI've read through prior posts on here and other forums, skirting this topic, but there doesn't seem to be a conclusive answer.\nIs there any way to manually edit the native list of reminder postponement duration options to at least match the calendar snooze options, or are we totally out of luck save for downloading software such as Snoozemaster which doesn't natively sort the problem, or having to specify a reminder snooze time via Siri (difficult in a quiet office environment)?\n\nA: Those notifications are managed by the Notification Center App Extension inside of Reminders.app: /Applications/Reminders.app/Contents/PlugIns/com.apple.RemindersNC.appex\nand displayed by Notification Center. Sadly none of the information used to create the window is editable by the user.\nInterestingly, there were more options when this feature was introduced in Mavericks. http://www.mactricksandtips.com/2013/11/change-the-snooze-time-of-a-reminder.html\n\nAs of macOS 12 Monterey the Reminder options are:\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to see what numbers I entered after calling an automated service?

Not the actual number that I initially dialed to make the call but the numbers that I entered after the making the call that I had to press to navigate the options of the automated call service?\n\nA: No, this information is not stored anywhere for calls you have made, only vice versa where you write the numbers specifically into a contact with pauses added in the first place for iOS to enter the numbers for you.\n", "Q: Mac usually can't read data from iPhone over USB I have an iPhone 6 Plus and a 2015 MBP.  Both are running the latest OS.\nMy goal is to transfer photos from the phone to my Mac.  I've been able to do it before.  But now, here are the symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I connect the phone to the Mac, the Photos Import program immediately displays \"Philip's iPhone\" in the Import section.\n\n*When I click \"Philip's iPhone\", Photos Import sits with a blank screen for 2--10 seconds, then pops up a dialog box that I need to unlock the phone, and the phone prompts me to Trust the computer.

Once I go through the above steps, iTunes pops up one of two messages: \"Could not read from the device\" or \"Could not send a message to the device\".  There is no phone icon in the top-left corner of the iTunes window.  Closing iTunes has no effect on the steps above.\nOnce today the Photos Import app actually showed my photos, and I was able to import half of them until the transfer suddenly stopped.  I was holding the phone in my hand at the time, so maybe something is physically loose.  However, jiggling the cable hasn't helped.\nI've tried several cables and both USB ports on the Mac, without any change in behavior.\nI am mystified.

If you're doing this in an unattended batchjob, p7zip is dirtier. I can find one of my snippets if you need it.\nA nice thing about xz though, is that you can assign n cores to a job. I believe it's the -T flag. Remember to nice it to 20 if you intend to use that mac for something other than a big paperweight if you use all cores at once.\n\nA: If a text file, you could use the terminal command split to split your initial file into smaller files and then compress them all in a batch file. The man page on split will tell you how to determine the size of smaller files. The split command will make as many output files as needed based on how large you told it to makes each file. Using batch compress makes this pretty time efficient.\n", "Q: Display fn keys by default in Touch Bar I would like to configure the Touch Bar of my MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016) to display by default the static fn keys (esc, F1, F2, ...) all the time, since they are the keys I use the most. \nFor now, I only managed to configure the touchbar to be static selecting the 'Expanded Control Strip' option (in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard), so it shows the esc, brightness, mission control, etc. \nIs there any workaround to do that yet? Running macOS Sierra 10.12.6.\n\nA: In System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts, under Function Keys, add apps to the list to show the function keys by default. The fn key will then be used for the inverse function, hiding the function row instead of showing it. You'll need to do this for every app where you would like this behaviour.\nYou can display function keys at all times and use Fn to display App Controls or Expand Control Strip in System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard.\n\n", "Q: Ergonomics: fingers to use to press Cmd and Opt keys at the same time I find myself struggling with keyboard shorts that require pressing CmdOpt at the same time.

He said that he was having trouble with the graphics cards cutting in and out and and then the power supply (PS) failed. I got a used power supply on ebay and put it all back together. It turns on, the graphic card (GC) ati 3870 fan powers up but there is no signal to the monitor. I tried all my monitors and two cables and still nothing on the monitor.\nI tried several different macOS versions (10.6 , 10.7 and 10.11 ) settling on  Lion. I moved the GC to all the different PCI slots, I pulled the GC from my 2006 mac pro, (an ATI 5770), which I know is compatible and still the same results. It boots up. With LION OS 10.7, I booted in safe mode and blindly typed in fsck -fy command and waited, then typed reboot and it rebooted. It will boot to target mode and I can access the drive from 2006 Mac Pro in disk utility and verify it. I have done pram and smc resets, and just for fun I tried the old PS and it fired up as well. I then did all of the above with the original power supply re-installed\nI have connected the power cables for both cards I tried,  there is nothing else in the other pci slots. It has an optical drive and I tried it with it installed and without. I have tried booting with a HD in different slots with no other drives installed.\nI found my install discs and booted from both. I think it booted, as there is still no signal to the monitor. Drive spins up and I can hear it read the disc.\nWhat are other reasons can there be for a monitor to not receive a signal but the graphic card still powers up ( I.e. fans on ). Assuming the graphic cards and the monitors I have tried are functioning properly in/on other machines? \nI have been searching and reading this Q&A and discussion forums and posts for days and can not find any more info other than it might be possible it is logic board?? If it is a logic board problem what could it be and how do I address it? \nAdvice OR ideas would be appreciated.\n\nA: Assuming that it is definitely a Mac Pro 3,1 (i.e. early-2008 Mac Pro model), the logic board should contain some diagnostic LEDs. These were used by technicians for troubleshooting purposes, so you may be able to leverage off these to isolate your problem.\nThe following chart explains each LED:\n\nAs you can see, normally LEDs 3, 4, 5, and 6 are off. In other words, they shouldn't be lit up unless there is an error. If any of these are lit up, then you know you have the corresponding problem explained in the Indicates column.\nAs for the other LEDs (1, 2, 7, 8, and 9) you will need to press the DIAG_LED button (it's next to the LEDs) to display them. Use the Color column to determine the status (i.e. this indicates the LED colour).\nI would check all of them, but obviously you'll want to pay particular attention to LED 7. If LED 7 is not lit up as green when you press the DIAG_LED button, then you know the GPU hasn't been configured.\nOnce you've done this, let me know how you went.\n[UPDATE]\nOkay, since you're only getting LEDs 2, 8 and 9 light up upon pressing the DIAG_LED button, we know that the computer isn't recognising the GPU because LED 7 is not green.\nOne of the issues you mentioned in your question was a potentially faulty power supply. I would actually re-install the one you bought on eBay. The reason for doing this is that some GPUs need more power to function, which is available from connectors on the logic board. And if you have any question marks over the original power supply, it's probably best to put it aside (although I acknowledge the one you bought was a used one).\nNow I have seen instances of the ATI Radeon HD 5770 needing to have the auxillary power connected in order to run. So it may be worth looking for the connector on the logic board (usually it's close to the front of the board, under the plastic slot holders). So I'd plug that in (if not already) and see if that gets it working for you. Make sure you check the cable is connected properly at both ends! \nIf not, in terms of general troubleshooting when there is no LED 7 lit up, you would want to try each of the following (NOTE: I know you've already done some of this, but for the sake of completeness and other users I am still including them):\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure the power supply and its cables are properly connected\n\n*make sure the graphics card is seated correctly \n\n*try the graphics card in each of the PCI slots\n\n*try a different graphics card\n\n*try replacing the PS3 power supply cable (as this is what supplies power to your PCI slots)\n\n\nNormally if you have no joy after all of the above troubleshooting steps, I'd say it's time for another logic board. \n", "Q: What causes incorrect PDFkit or blurry PDF display in macOS Sierra and how to fix or remedy that situation? Problem: Some applications like Preview or Skim do not display anything in certain PDFs, primarily in text PDFs, while images work fine. Skim even displays tables of contents but both start beachballing heavily after quite a while.\nThe PDFs display fine in Adobe Reader and I do not see anything meaningful in log or Console.\nLogs for \"Devices\" in Console are filled up with messages like these:\n\nPreview   the behavior of the UICollectionViewFlowLayout is not defined because:\nPreview   the item width must be less than the width of the UICollectionView minus the section insets left and right values.\nPreview   Please check the values return by the delegate.\n\nInterestingly this situation looks infectious.\nCertain small PDFs open OK at first and keep this state while scrolling. But after opening a larger PDF, which does not display anything, the first PDF degrades its display quality, especially after scrolling.\nTo illustrate this, left is Preview.app, right is QuickLook preview for /Library/Documentation/License.lpdf:\n\nIt seems quite weird that this looks more like a collection of bugs in Sierra's Preview.\nOne bug is that the intermediate scrolling representation in Preview sometimes doesn't get updated properly once scrolling stops. This effect is visible with almost all PDFs but remedies itself rather quickly most of the time.\nThe worst bug seems to be triggered when using big and complex PDFs especially when they were produced with LaTeX.\nOne example seems to be this UserGuide.\nPreview seems to be affected the worst. Closing Preview windows pseudo auto-quits the program but doesn't eliminate it from the list of running processes. Once a document like this is opened Preview.app or Skim descend into an abyss of weird behaviour like in the screenshot above.\nOn other Sierra systems that were less manipulated than mine the same behaviour was observed, but not always.\nCurrently I do not see which systems will be commonly affected nor a pattern for which PDFs will trigger these symptoms.\n\nA: The answer to this question involves a bunch of things. \n\n\n*\n\n*Preview/PDFKit in Sierra is just buggy (10.12.5 +.6 Preview Version 9.0 (909.18)). It is less robust in this regard as Preview in either Yosemite or High Sierra. And coupled with apparent auto-termination this is the only 'background process' that really matters in this regard.\n\n*Once the bug gets triggered (enough) it is much earlier in Sierra Preview compared to other versions and propagates through the application: that vanishes from the Dock  or from the Cmd+Tab  application switcher but remains active in the background as Activity Monitor will show.\nThat tempted to reach the conclusion that almost all PDFs were affected at first. But once a killall Preview cleared that process up for good, only bug-triggering PDFs (that might justifiably called substandard) really triggered that behaviour.\n\n*But one such concrete bug trigger I could positively identify is related to Multiple PDFs with page group included in a single page warning. \nIt is somehow dependent on the number of these incorrect inclusion attributes but I couldn't determine the exact amount.\nSince many of my own PDFs, files I downloaded and had to work with and also the given example in the Question above demonstrate: this is a widespread weakness leading to very unwanted behaviour on Sierra, not only but (for me) mostly from LaTeX generated content or many includes for an assembled PDF.\nUnless this bug in Preview is fixed, or the PDFs are reflown there is no solution but to avoid Preview on Sierra for these kind of files. \nA workaround is to use other applications like Acrobat Reader from the start for all PDFs to display if they contain text.\nOnce this bug is triggered with Preview, it is necessary to kill all PDFkit related processes since quitting the application Preview via cmd+q or the equivalent menu item is not enough sufficient.\n", "Q: Sierra won't install From my mac OS 10.8.5 I downloaded OS Sierra from app store.

There are several questions about hibernating (suspending to disk) but most are concerned with battery life and so many answers basically say just use sleep (suspend to RAM) because the battery will last better than you think. Other answers are simply out of date.\nI don't want to use hibernate because of battery concerns. I want it because the SSD is dead and I use an external USB 3 hard drive as my boot drive. In other words, I have only this one drive. No working built-in drive.\nIt's almost as fast and I'm happy with it. But if the cable moves too much while the MacBook is in my backpack the OS will crash and anything that was in RAM is lost. I want to transport the gear with the drive separate from the computer.

I know there is a $99 fee for being an Apple developer but I was confused as to exactly where this applies. The Swift language itself is open source and downloadable through Xcode. If we were to just create the application but not place it on the App Store for purchase, do we still have to pay the $99?\n\nA: The $99 fee is only if you want to publish apps to the App Store. You can download all the latest release versions of the development tools and create your own apps without paying anything.\nThe Development account also allows you access to the private beta versions of Apple's operating systems and development tools, so if you wanted the latest beta of watchOS, iOS, macOS or tvOS, you would need to pay the $99.\n\nA: In addition, the free developer account has several limitations. The free account limits the number of devices (3) you can distribute the app on, the number of apps (3) per device, the number of days that the app will remain functional (7) and the number of app IDs(10) created in one week. These limits are subject to change at any time. The free account is fine to develop with but if you want to use your apps for more than a week then you will need a paid developer account.\n", "Q: Locked iPhone 4 — What specifically can I access? I’m purchasing several iPhone 4 models for an art project.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible?\nI don’t need any other connectivity resources, and I have no intention to ever use the phones otherwise.\n\nA: The seller is most likely referring to Activation Lock, which will prevent you from using the iPhones entirely unless you know the Apple ID and password of the legitimate owners.\nYou will not be able to copy data onto those phones, or view anything on the screen other than the Activation Lock screen:\n\nPretty much the only use you could have for those iPhones would be for spare parts. However as @bjbk mentions, they were most likely stolen. I would advise you stay away from this merchandise.\n", "Q: How to get MySQL's port on Mac through the terminal?

That so, I have to buy another HDMI to DisplayPort adapter, but the display does not work when I connect to my MBP.\nI'm not sure it is because of the setup ( USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter -> HDMI cab -> DisplayPort adapter -> external Display ) does not work or not.\nThere is no USB-C to DisplayPort in Apple site, maybe MBP 2017 cannot output to DisplayPort?\nWhat should I do next to make my Dell display work?\nNote: \n\n\n*\n\n*I tried my MBP with USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter and it works correctly.

Most DP to HDMI adapters are passive, meaning they require a DP output with backward compatibility to HDMI and DVI to work.  These are called DP++ ports and will have a DP++ symbol to mark them.  Active adapters only work one way, as in if it's made to adapt DP to HDMI then it cannot adapt HDMI to DP.  It's likely you have a passive adapter or an active adapter plugged in backwards.\n\"There is no USB-C to DisplayPort in Apple site, maybe MBP 2017 cannot output to DisplayPort?\"\nDisplayPort is the only thing it can output.  Apple sells an adapter to HDMI because there is no adapter needed to get DP video out.\n\"What should I do next to make my Dell display work?\"\nGet a passive cable with HDMI on one end and DVI-D on the other, use the DVI input instead of the DP input.\nHDMI is little more than DVI with a different connector, it's more than that but for the most part DVI equals HDMI and HDMI equals DVI.  Think of it like getting a little dongle to plug a mouse into a USB-C port, or a 1/8\" headphone to stereo RCA jack cable.  It's the same thing, don't make it complicated.\nIf you want to plug a MacBook with USB-C into a DisplayPort display then just get a simple passive USB-C to DP cable.  If you need more ports then get any of a number of cheap mini-docks so you have DP, USB, and maybe USB-C power pass-thru.\nIf there is a situation where the only output you have is HDMI and the only input you have is DP then only an active HDMI to DP adapter will do.  A passive cable will make a physical connection, but no video will pass through.  Passive adapters only work from DP++ to HDMI or DVI.  Active adapters will work too but unless there is a concern with needing compatibility with DP (not DP++) outputs, or to get higher resolutions from HDMI 2.0 (which is not part of the DP++ backward compatibility), they are not gaining anything for the extra cost.\n", "Q: How to export all the raw media from iMovie libraries?

For example, if statement will be read, string will be purple, etc. \nAs far as I know, it may have something to do with .profile file?\n\nA: Use :syn on to turn on syntax highlighting. Put this in your ~/.vimrc file to use it every time. (Vim should detect your terminal type automatically, no need to worry about that.)\nTo customize the colors, use the :highlight command. Type :help :hi in Vim for more information on this.

I have both iPhoto and Photos installed on my Mac and use both independently of each other. However, whenever I launch the Photos app I get the following prompt:\n\nIs there a way for me to permanently tell Photos that I never want to use iCloud with Photos? I only want to use iCloud with iPhoto and worry that one day I will accidentally pick the wrong option when the above message appears.\n—UPDATE—\nYes, I know that iPhoto is old software replaced with Photos. \nI have a particular library I use with iPhoto because of a number of shared albums via iCloud and because one of my Macs cannot use Photos.\nI do use Photos, but only with another library I never ever ever want to use iCloud with.\nI am happy to only have one library connected with iCloud and that is my iPhoto library.\nI am not familiar with Terminal (quite frankly it scares me) but if I can do this with terminal, please provide very clear instructions. That’s what my bounty is for. Any answer that can achieve what I want.\nThank you!\n\nA: I'm going to take a step back and redefine the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have an iPhoto library with active shared albums.\n\n*You have a Photos library that you don't want to use iCloud with.\n\n\nThis is not difficult, but you need to work with the system, not go against the grain, which is what you're asking. Even if you found a command-line \"solution\", it would not be guaranteed to work in the future and would likely be undone with the next Photos update.\nHere's what you do:\nOn the Mac that doesn't support Photos, you leave iPhoto. You leave your iPhoto Library intact and use as normal.\nOn all other Macs, use only Photos. Create a new Photos library (hold Option as you launch Photos and click \"Create New\") and designate that library to be the Photos System Library. This means that all Shared Albums, PhotoStream, etc. will be synced to this library, and this library only. See https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21363?locale=en_US for more information.\nOther Photos libraries, which are not the Photos System Library, will show you the following when you look at Photos > Preferences > iCloud:\n\nNow you can update your Shared Albums from any of your Macs, the one with only iPhoto or the one with Photos.\nOn the Mac with Photos, the only change is holding Option when you launch Photos to choose which library to use each session.\nThis will accomplish what you want without needing to 'hack' the system.\n==== earlier answer mostly trying to understand the problem better ===\niPhoto and Photos are iCloud enabled, but only one library can be the primary iCloud-connected library. As iPhoto is deprecated, Apple is trying to nudge you along to only use Photos and get rid of iPhoto.\nPhotos is the replacement for iPhoto. They were never intended to both be used. In fact, in some cases, Apple would invalidate the iPhoto application to force users to only use Photos.\nSince both iPhoto and Photos use things like PhotoStream and other services through iCloud, I imagine that the two programs are getting confused and they can't behave properly. Frankly, I'm surprised you're not experiencing sync'ing or other problems since you are using both.\nThe first time Photos appeared, it went through the process of migrating your old iPhoto library to a new Photos library, but it left the old one intact. This allows the user to double-check that the migration was successful before deleting the iPhoto library, to free up space if not for minimizing risk of confusion (\"why are my photos appearing there and not here?\")\nSo, if I may ask, are the photos in both your iPhoto Library and your Photos library more or less the same, or do you have two distinct libraries?\nIf the former, then I think you should move to Photos and ditch iPhoto completely, as it's no longer supported and will likely only cause further problems/confusion.\nIf the latter, then I suggest that you upgrade that new, distinct iPhoto Library to a Photos library for the same reason as above and use the Option-key modifier while starting Photos to choose which library you want to use each time you launch Photos. And ditch iPhoto.\nThe short version is that as iPhoto is deprecated, unsupported software, the longer you continue to use it, the more likely you will have problems.\n\nA: I only can give you this \"work around\":\nMake a second useraccount to work with Photo's or iPhoto.\nThis way they'll never get mixed up.\n", "Q: Does Apple allow buying a new phone through its website the day it's released? I am new to Apple and I am not sure how it does things with new phones, but I wanted to know if and when the next iPhone is released will it be made available on its website the day it's released?\nI tried finding some info regarding this online but it's hard to get good information of when they updated their website and if it was made available on the same day.\nIf it is, I don't quite understand why people would line up and wait hours to get it or am I missing something?  \n\nA: The only thing you're missing is the need to be part of the party.\nPeople like queuing up to be first.\nIf you pre-order it online* you can answer the door in your pyjamas & get your phone the same day, without the queue. I've known them arrive at 8am on release day.  \n*Note: If you wait too long to pre-order, you won't get it on the first day, but some time later, depending on how popular the release is.\nAnnouncements are usually made in the first week or so of September, with the release being about a week later. The online stores will go live for pre-orders at about the time the announcement/conference ends. They will be closed for the day up to that point.\nNo date has yet been set for even the announcement, so at present everything is still speculation.\n", "Q: How do I use tabs in Mac Mail on El Capitan? I want to use tabs when composing new emails in Apple Mail on my Mac. I searched here and read this question:\nHow can I use tabs in Mac Mail?\nThe thing is this question says it’s a new feature in macOS Sierra, but I am convinced that in the past I used tabs in Apple Mail. I know it wasn’t in Sierra because my Mac runs El Capitan and has never had Sierra installed.\nDid I just imagine this? Was it a dream? Or is this actually possible in El Capitan too?\n\nA: Yes, it’s possible. You just need to run Mail in full screen mode first. You do this by clicking on the green button at top left of Mail’s window. \nOnce in full screen mode, create a new mail message as usual. This opens the New Message window, but now whenever you do commandN it’ll add a tab to the existing New Message window for your other new message.\n", "Q: Desktop and app in Split View In my office, I have an LG ultrawide display connected to my MBP (which is inside a Henge dock). The size of the display allows me to use multiple apps in Split View really well. I often use two Parallels VMs next to each other in this way, and that works really great. \nThis got me thinking, however: is there any way to use a desktop in Split View next to a VM?\nI'm guessing there is no 'official' way to do so, but is there any way to get this done, or get something similar going?\nTo further clarify: \nWhat I'd like to achieve is this, but with my Mac desktop in stead of one of my VMs:\n\n\nA: I think the answer is no, as the Desktop (with multiple windows, Dock, menu bar, etc.) is not a resizable window and so can't be split in the same way as other windows.\nThe best you can do is show the Desktop folder as a folder which can participate in the Split View.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 stuck in recovery mode and need to download iOS 11 beta 1 I tried to downgrade from iOS 11 beta four to 10.3.3 and my iPhone 6 is stuck in recovery mode. I read I need to restore to an earlier beta to unstick the phone but can't find good links (I am not a registered developer with Apple). How can I download the .ipsw?\n\nA: If you need to switch out of recovery mode, use ReiBoot (www.tenorshare.com/products/reiboot.html). FOr .ipsw just find any .ipsw file adequate for you iPhone though. You need to look the number of your iPhone, for instance, my iPhone is iPhone 5s, hence it is iPhone 6,2.

It saved me countless hours of retrying and restarting my iPhone.\n", "Q: Merge two folders, without overwriting any files I have a folder called \"AeroFS\", and another one called \"AeroFS Backup\". \n\"AeroFS Backup\" contains everything that \"AeroFS\" contains, and more. \nI need to merge \"AeroFS Backup\" back into the \"AeroFS\" folder, but not overwrite ANY existing files, even if they are newer. \nI'm not particularly comfortable with terminal commands, but may give them a try.\nIs there a free app that can do this without overwriting existing files at all?\n\nA: Not sure why the other answer was deleted, it was almost right.\nI use the terminal command to do this:\ncp -n -v '/src'/* '/dest'\ncp = Copy\n-n = Don't overwrite existing\n-v = Verbose output\n\nA: Depending on the version of macOS you're running, you could just select all the files in AeroFS Backup and drag them into the AeroFS folder. When you do you'll get prompted as below:\n\nIf you then tick the Apply to ALL checkbox and click on the Keep Both button, you'll merge the files as you want. (In older versions of macOS you may be prompted with the Merge button instead of the Keep Both button). If you don't get either option, try holding the Option key down as you drag the files across.\nIMPORTANT - Before doing this with the folders you want, I would create a couple of test folders (or just make copies of the folders you want to merge) and then test this behaviour, as I'm not sure what versions of macOS originally offered this functionality.\n\nA: You can do this in Terminal with a short script:\nfor file in /source/directory; do $time=date +%s; if [[ -f /target/directory/$file ]]; then cp $file ${file}-${time}; else cp $file /target/directory/$file; fi; done\n\nThis will check to see if the file already exists and if it does it will append the time in seconds to the destination filename and copy it over.  The advantage this has over just doing a -v verbose or -n no overwrite is that it will ensure there are no multiple duplicates.  \nAdditionally, this has the added advantage that if the filenames are the same but are different in size/content it gives you the opportunity to see the potential dupes and deal with them.\n\nA: Without using terminal, you can drag your files from the origin folder (AeroFS Backup) to the destination folder (AeroFS) and when Finder realizes that the same file exists, it will show an alert, asking you what you want it to do.  If you press \"Option\" while looking at that alert, one of the options will change to \"Skip\" and you can then apply that to all the files that you are dragging over.\nI recorded a brief video showing this in action\n\nUsing Terminal, I highly recommend the RSYNC solution:\nrsync -av --ignore-existing sourceFolder/ destinationFolder\n\n\nA: Synkron might well do exactly what you want.\nThe price is right. It has plenty of features.\nI use it to sync from my master folder on Mac over to an NTFS folder on a Raspberry pi HD.\nIt does not go wild copying files that are already there.\n", "Q: Using video recorded by iPad how can I calculate the exact time duration between 2 frames? I shot a video with an iPad recently for a school project. \nMy teacher told me the iPad shoots at 30 fps, but opening the video afterwards VLC tells me the frame rate is 29.970030.\nBy watching the video and stepping through the frames, how can I calculate the exact time duration between 2 frames?\nE.g. what's the time difference between frame 100 and frame 130? Is it 1 second (assuming 30 fps) or slightly more/less?\n\nA: iOS' native camera app (iPhone/iPad) does not have a fixed frame rate.\nI attached the details for a short clip I recorded. It varies between 28.571 fps and 30.000 fps\n\nVLC displays a frame rate of 29.973708 fps for the same clip.\n\nA: 29.97* is a Standard... an odd standard but a standard nevertheless.\nIt is commonly known as drop-frame\nYou can read the entire wikipedia article, but basically it was a kludge to make analog 30fps broadcasts not display odd interference patterning based on the frequency of the picture sub-code & sound sub-code. [You really don't need to know all this ;)\nThe 'drop frame' is really not dropping frames; it's dropping time code so that it doesn't eventually go out of sync.\nThe picture should actually still be running at 30fps, in \"real\" time.\nThe formula, btw is 30/1.001 - though being a kludge in the first place it doesn't quite work like that...\n\nThat is, drop frame TC drops 18/18000 frame numbers, equivalent to\n  1/1000, achieving 30×0.999 = 29.97 frame/s. This is very slightly\n  slower than the true NTSC frame rate of 30/1.001 = 29.97002997\n  frame/s, which is equivalent to dropping 1/1001 frame numbers. The\n  difference is one additional NTSC frame per 1,000,000 drop frame TC\n  values, which is negligible.\n\nThis one you can truly blame the Americans & the NTSC** television standard for - the rest of the world went with a far more sensible 25fps which never needed this workaround.\n*or more precisely, depending which way you calculate it, 29.97002997\n**NTSC stands for Never Twice the Same Colour ;-)\n", "Q: Why Siri says that X is not on my find my friends list?

After a moment, you should see a round (X) appear in the upper left corner. Click and it will delete the space, repeat until you have only one left.\nIf you find that when you launch an app a space comes back, right-click on the App's icon in the dock, and look under the \"Options >\" menu. There may be a checkmark beside \"This desktop.\" If so, selecting \"None\" and then closing the Space like before should stop that.\nEdited based on comments: Mission Control does need to be re-enabled first. In the terminal, type\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock mcx-expose-disabled\n\nand then\nkillall Dock\n\nAnd wait for the dock to reload.

Also, note that if anything in the path contains single quotes (apostrophes), you'll need to replace each one with '\\'' – I'm using single quotes here to take care of any other quoting issues, and this will end the quote string, put in a quote, and start another (Single-quoted strings don't accept any form of escape, even escaping a single quote!).\nFor more information on this command, type man mkdir in Terminal.\nFor more information on shell quoting, type man bash in Terminal, then use /quoting to search for \"quoting\"—this should get you to the appropriate section.\n", "Q: Is it safe to eject an SSD running your OS while the computer is asleep? I have macOS Sierra installed on a external SanDisk SSD. I use it for school & work related stuff. I plug it into my MacBook Pro via USB and I boot into instead of the actual HDD that is installed in the laptop. At the end of the day I pack up my stuff and go home. What I do is turn off the laptop and then unplug the SSD. This is getting quite annoying and I was wondering if it was okay to put the macbook to sleep and then disconnect the SSD. Once home I would plug back the SSD again and wake the macbook. Would that cause any errors? \n\nA: I decided to TOFTT and put things to the test. I closed all applications running and clicked the apple icon and set the MBP to sleep. Once the screen turned black I closed the lid. I waited approximately 4-5 seconds and then unplugged the SSD (via USB) and re-connected on another USB port. When I opened the lid, it woke right away (As in it didn't go into the login screen). The OS was frozen. I couldn't click on anything. I just saw the desktop. I had to force shut down the MBP. So I am guessing what I am trying to accomplish is not possible. My only other thought is that maybe I didn't let the computer sleep long enough and I opened it right away which caused that error.\n", "Q: Phishing Mail AppleID I got the following phishing email from “Apple”:\n\nYour ApрIe ID ( xxx ) was used to sign in to other device.

Why does clicking the t.co link take me to the legitimate Apple website, when I should instead be redirected to a phishing website? Is it possible I am done any harm here caused by cross site scripting? Or is it only redirecting to a fake website? \n\nA: That is not the legitimate Apple ID website. Notice the lowercase l in the URL in place of an uppercase i. Not only that, the actual domain is something-verify.info rather than apple.com.\nIn this case appleld.apple.com is merely a subdomain, and since anyone can register anything as a subdomain on their own site, they should have kept that i instead of replacing it with an l.

Some commands which worked up until Mavericks no longer work in Yosemite and beyond.  \nMy search for a list returns a good deal of links up until Mavericks; but, that is not so useful.  \nIs there anywhere which has compiled the commands for newer versions of the OS?\n\nA: Depending on how much spelunking you are willing to do you can look at the html command templates in the servermgrd bundles for a partial list of command names/formats. For example to get a list of commands that the afp plugin accepts you could look at:\n/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/share/servermgrd/html/servermgr_afp.html\n\nand look at the javascript in the template.\nLook at the selection == \"command_name\" for the names of the commands and the rest of the commandValue for the plist formatted command. Then you can use the serveradmin command format to send the command to the plugin.\nA different (and more up to date) way to find out commands is to look at the Server activity log to see the plist formatted commands sent by Server.app to the servermgrd backend. Look in \n~/Library/Logs/Server.log\n\nfor the commands and their replies. You may need to turn on the logging from one of the menus (I'm away from my server right now so I'm not sure how I enabled the logging).\nIf you want network throughput, open Server.app, go to the stats panel, select the network stats and then look at the Server.log to get the commands you need to use.\n", "Q: Is it possible to bind mouse 4 btn to a specific key on the keyboard on MacOS?

I would like to write text to a \"Note\" (as opposed to a standard .txt or .rtf file), because Mac Notes automatically sync to an iCloud account, across devices. \n(I understand that one can use various means to achieve the same effect with standard, i.e., non-proprietary, text documents, e.g., with a service like Dropbox. Notes.app is simply much more convenient.)\nHowever, it appears that there is no way to write to a Note in AppleScript. I say this because, it doesn't seem that Notes are actually saved anywhere on the Mac as an .rtf (or similar) file. Per this question (but, note that the question was asked in 2013), I checked out the following directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/\n\n\n*\n\n*and\n\n\n*~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/\nI found nothing that resembled a readable text document. I opened some of these files in TextEdit.app, and discovered that these files contain pure gobbledygook-text.\nI'd imagine that I could effectively code an AppleScript to \"write to a Notes document,\" by triggering mouse clicks and key presses. But, I am curious if writing to a Note can be done, in a \"proper\" fashion.\n\nA: Notes is scriptable, and the dictionary can be opened with Script Editor for details.\nThere's also a lengthy tutorial here.\nAlthough I've not tested it with iCloud, you should be able to set the account, and create a note in that account.\nSimplifying the example on that page, and using my Exchange account, I was able to create the note using this script:\ntell application \"Notes\"\n  tell account \"Exchange\"\n    make new note at folder \"Notes\" with properties {name:\"this is a test\", body:\"and more text\"}\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nTo get the contents of an existing note, in order to modify it:\ntell application \"Notes\"\n  tell account \"Exchange\"\n    tell folder \"Notes\"\n      get body of note \"this is a test\"\n    end tell\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nAnd, to modify the content:\ntell application \"Notes\"\n  tell account \"Exchange\"\n    tell folder \"Notes\"\n      set body of note \"this is a test\" to \"reset the body text\"\n    end tell\n  end tell\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Avoid the terminal process to close, after BBEdit runs a script I use BBEdit to write and test Python scripts, and I usually run the scripts in a terminal process, with the \"Run in Terminal\" command.\nIs there a way to have the terminal process opened by BBEdit stay \"active\", after the script is completed?\nI would like not to have the \n[Process completed] \n\nmessage and instead to still have an active prompt, either the shell or the the Python environment, with all the variables I have created in the script still existing. \nThis would be similar to the situation when I launch the script from an existing terminal process, either from the shell:\n$ python script_name.py\n\nor from the python interpreter:\n>>> script_name.py\n\nIn particular, in the last case, when the script exits, I still have the process active in the terminal window.\n\nA: As I understand, you have a Python script in BBEdit.\n\nYou choose to test the code using the \"Run in Terminal\" option from the '#!' menu.\n\nNow a Terminal window opens, runs the script and exits.\n\nNow here is the culprit. BBEdit does not only run your script, but also adds an exit. There is no option in BBEdit to remove this exit command. But BBEdit is highly scriptable and there are some workarounds. You can create a BBEdit Script (from the Scripts menu) that runs, but personally I think creating Service is the easiest one (run some AppleScript that opens your script in the Terminal as you would have done manually).\nIn this treat you have provided a script that actually does what you want.\n\nA: Building on the answer of CousinCocaine, and on this answer to an old question I posted myself on the BBEdit forum, I have come to this AppleScript, which is specific for Python:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Auth: Christopher Stone\n# modif Fabio Grazioso\n# dCre: 2015/09/22 11:00\n# dMod: 2017/10/03 18:40 \n# Appl: BBEdit, Terminal\n# Task: Attempt to run the front text document in Terminal.app.\n# Libs: None\n# Osax: None\n# Tags: @Applescript, @Script, @BBEdit, @Run, @Front, @Document, @Terminal, @Python\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ntell application \"BBEdit\"\n    tell front text document\n        if on disk = false then error \"Front document is not saved!\"\n        if modified = true then save\n        if contents of line 1 does not start with \"#!\" then error \"No valid shebang line found!\"\n        set docName to its name\n        set docFile to POSIX path of (get its file)\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nset shCMD to text 2 thru -1 of \"\nFILE=\" & docFile & \";\nif [[ ! -x \\\"$FILE\\\" ]]; then\n  chmod +x \\\"$FILE\\\";\nfi\n\"\ndo shell script shCMD\n\nset {oldTIDS, AppleScript's text item delimiters} to {AppleScript's text item delimiters, \"/\"}\nset docName to quoted form of docName\nset docParentPath to quoted form of ((text items 1 thru -2 of docFile) as text)\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldTIDS\n\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    if name of windows = {missing value} then do script\n    if processes of front window = {} then do script\n\n\n    tell front window\n        if its busy = true then\n            do script \"cd \" & docParentPath & \" && python -i \" & docName\n        else\n            do script \"cd \" & docParentPath & \" && python -i \" & docName in selected tab\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI find this answer better than the one proposed by CousinCocaine just because I can create a keyboard shortcut to the script (AFAIK it is not possible to associate a shortcut to a service).\nThe steps to follow for this to work are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script code in the Script Editor.app (found in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder)\n\n*Compile the script (hammer icon on the Editor bar)\n\n*Save it in the BBEdit scripts folder: /Users//Library/Application\\ Support/BBEdit/Scripts/\n\n*Optional In BBEdit associate the script to a keyboard shortcut, in the Preferences -> Menus & Shortcuts -> Scripts (you have to click to the right of the script's name, where it says \"none\", and press your shortcut)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Finally, you create a script in BBEdit, e.g. a python script, you save it, and while it is the front window in BBEdit, you select the AppleScript from BBEdit's Scripts menu. This will send the python script to the Terminal and the script will be executed.\n\n\nAbout the AppleSript, notice that the option \"-i\" in the python call in the line\ndo script \"cd \" & docParentPath & \" && python -i \" & docName\n\nmakes so that after the execution of the python script, the python interpreter is not exited, as per the request in the question.\nIf the lines\ndo script \"cd \" & docParentPath & \" && python -i \" & docName\ndo script \"cd \" & docParentPath & \" && python -i \" & docName in selected tab\n\nare replaced by the lines\ndo script \"cd \" & docParentPath & \" && ./\" & docName\ndo script \"cd \" & docParentPath & \" && ./\" & docName in selected tab\n\nthen this AppleScript can launch any script, provided the right \"shebang\" line is present in the script, as the very first line.\nFor a python script, the shebang line should be:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nwhile for a bash shell script the shebang line should be:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nA: $ python script_name.py &\n\nThis will run  the process in the background. \nAlternatively you could try the answers here for which I do not take the credit\n\nA: This isn't quite what you want, but it is a reasonable workaround:\nFSWatch.  Briefly it monitors a directory or file for changes, and runs a script whenever it sees a change.\nSo instead of running in terminal, you have a terminal window open with fswatch watching the file(s) for changes.  When it sees one, it runs the script -- in this case the file being watched.\nThis has the advantage that it runs in the same window each time, so you aren't popping up new terminal windows all the time.\nDirections here: \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/24573584/how-to-watch-file-changes-on-mac-osx-using-fswatch\n\nA: In the Terminal preferences under Profiles, select the profile you use by default, and go to the Shell tab. Under \"When the shell exits\" select \"Close if the shell exited cleanly\".\nThat should make the window/tab close when the script you run exits cleanly.\n", "Q: Remote Erase through Find my iPhone — Changed Password My iPhone was stolen (with the SIM card ejected, on my seat). When I logged in to iCloud it made me reset the password, which meant my Apple ID password was now different from the one on my iPhone when it was stolen.\nI figured there was no way I could find my iPhone, so I hit Erase. 3 days later I got a message saying my phone was erased. Is that a lie, because my phone had a different iCloud password on it than when it was stolen? It was running iOS 8.\nWhen I first checked Find my iPhone it was offline and pending erase. Then I got an email at 1 am saying it was erased.\n\nA: Changing your password would have no incidence on whether your iPhone was able to receive an Erase command from iCloud. The reason it took 3 days for your iPhone to become erased is that without a SIM card it had no Internet connection.\nWhat must have happened is the thief inserted a SIM card into the iPhone after a few days, at which point your iPhone connected to the Internet and received the command from iCloud to erase itself, which it did. That’s when you got the confirmation.\nYou can read up more at iCloud: Erase your device.\n\nAfter you set a device to erase\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If your device is online, the remote erase begins. A confirmation email is sent to your Apple ID email address.\n  \n\nAddendum to address lingering concerns:\nUnless you can verify that the email is not legitimately from Apple (which you can do by viewing the headers on a desktop mail client), I’m confused as to why you would insist on believing that Apple is lying to you. Apple has a vested interest in making sure your account and devices are safe.\nYour iPhone is linked to your iCloud account by a secure token rather than by sending a username and password every time a connection is made. When your iPhone connected to the Internet, iCloud instructed it to wipe itself before telling it its session was expired. It would make no sense for a logout request to supercede a wipe request.\nIn fact, when a device is compromised in any way (such as theft), changing your password immediately is a good first step towards protecting your account. If changing your own password helped the thief get into your device (by disabling remote wipe), you’d be even more at the mercy of said thief.\n", "Q: Blocking calls with no SIM card automatically on new? If I block a number from my old iPhone without a SIM card, does that block the number on my new iPhone with SIM card? This is a replacement iPhone for my broken one.\n\nA: The Call Blocking feature built-into iOS doesn’t depend on having a SIM card per se. However it does synchronize over iCloud, meaning that if your previous iPhone had an Internet connection at any point (and you were logged in to your iCloud account) then its blocked numbers were synced with iCloud.\nConversely, your new iPhone would synchronize its block list as soon as you connected it to your iCloud account.\nYou can verify whether your block list transferred by opening Settings → Phone → Call Blocking & Identification.\n", "Q: How to determine which process or application is using excessive data My 2015 MacBook Pro uses wifi from a 4G dongle. Some process or application is regularly making large download requests, which are very expensive over 4G - it recently used $60 of data in a single day, for an unknown purpose.\nHow can I detect (and disable) these processes?\nTo demonstrate, I rebooted and immediately opened Activity Monitor (so I'd have an accurate measure of the network activity), then used the laptop for an hour or so (but without constantly monitoring the activity).\nThe total Data Received is 428Mb (confirmed on the wifi dongle), but the cumulative network traffic of the processes listed is far less than this:\n\nI assume that one or more processes is running, requesting data, then closing, and that after this they're no longer individually listed in the Activity Monitor, so it's not possible to determine which processes are implicated.\nHow can I debug which application or process is causing this? Activity Monitor doesn't seem to be precise enough, so is there a better option?\nPS I have disabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*App Store \"check for updates\" and \"automatically download\"\n\n*DropBox\n\n*Google Drive\n\n*iCloud Drive\n\n*and I haven't opened iTunes.\n\n\nA: You can monitor the traffic with numerous applications and tools. One that is already installed is \n/usr/bin/nettop\n\nTo block this unwanted traffic the easiest you also have numerous options:\n– block the destinations via /etc/hosts\n– block the ports used by those unruly programs using your builtin pf firewall \n– use one of the application level firewalls like\n–– RadioSilence\n–– LittleSnitch\n–– HandsOff\n–– Vallum\n–– TripMode\nMost important and practical is of course to just uninstall the offenders if posssible.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s became hot quickly draining battery and shutdown unexpectedly I have iPhone 4s and it becomes slowly day by day so I decided reset (format) my phone and reset it as a new iPhone.

Please help me if there are any remedy?\nIt's running with iOS Version: 9.3.5 ( 13G36 )\n\nA: It sounds like a battery issue.\nYou may need to take it to a repair shop and have it replaced IMMEDIATELY. \nI say that because I have seen an iPhone 4 battery explode before. It's not a pretty sight. Consider the average lifespan of a lithium battery: \n\nThe typical estimated life of a Lithium-Ion battery is about two to\n  three years or 300 to 500 charge cycles, whichever occurs first.\n\nThis is a very common issue for the iPhone 4 and can be repaired pretty easily. \nI'm also going to cite my personal and proffesional experience with this.\n", "Q: Deleting all words in MS word file except bold and italic in the terminal command I have a big MS word file. I want to delete all words in the file except the bold and italic using terminal command.

You could use for example Python, Perl or similar to create the program.\n", "Q: How to connect a 3.5mm microphone (not amplified) to an iMac for recording? I have a headset which has separate headphone and microphone jacks (both 3.5mm) that I would like to do some recording with.\nI initially thought, just plug headphone into headphone and micrphone into line-in and it would all work. Needless to say, I didn't get any sound from the microphone. After reasearching, I discovered that the line-in is for amplified sources only, not basic microphones and that the mic needs to be ran through an amplifier first. Alternatively, I could get an adaptor which combines the 2 jacks into 1 and plug it into the headphone plug as I understand that it can pick up mic inputs.\nI don't have any adaptors and in the past (on  PC) I've been able to run a mic through a line-in and use software to amplify and reduce noise to get a mic to work and record.\nI found software called 'LineIn' but that doesn't seem to do the job. I was wondering if there is a software approach I can use which will amplify the mic on the line-in so I can use it to record and thus, not have to buy yet another adaptor?\nMy other thought (which I have known to work on a PC); Would it be possible to swap the line-in to be used as a headphone output and then use the headphone ouput as a mic-in?\nThanks!\n\nA: What you need is a audio mixer (I personally use and like the Behringer line)\n \nThe inputs/outputs built in to computers (both Macs and PCs) are basically rubbish - they are looking to give you functionality to mark a check box for marketing purposes, not give you the ability to make good to professional quality recordings..\nThis mixer will give you a USB interface to your Mac while allowing you to bring two sources in while having granular control over input sound levels.   \nGranted, it's not a \"free\" solution, but at $30 USD, it's a very economical solution that gives you better quality and more flexibility than what you have at present.  \n", "Q: How to clone iPad 1 to other iPad 1 I need to transfer all apps from iPad 1 (without cellular) to another iPad 1 (with cellular).

I have my config files in Google Drive, whose names start with dot.\nWhen I download it either with Safari or with Firefox the dot is removed from the file name. I set up to always show dot-files with defaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles -bool true, but that didn't help, the file with dot is downloaded at all.\nIs there a way to prevent web browsers from renaming my files completely?\n\nA: There are several issues with you problem.\nFirst: Downloading a File via a Webbrowser is bound to naming conventions and recommendations which are based on the recommendations from the W3C and RFC's from the IETF, probably RFC3986. There is a Recommendation for URI's from the W3C which include \"Reserved Characters\". As you can probably guess by that point the dot, as well as double-dot, are reserved characters. In your case the Webbrowsers are automatically renaming the Files with a preceding dot. There is probably no way around that.\nSecond: Filenames in OSX follow the Unix Schemes in which a preceding dot is marking a file to be hidden (see an interesting explanation to the history here). The Terminal Command you entered is only displaying all files in the Finder, which is irrelevant in you case since you cannot download the File with the preceding dot in the Filename in the first place.\nPossible Solution:\n\n*\n\n*Try different Browsers, but i doubt that you will find one which doesn't adhere to the naming Conventions\n\n\n*you could try the 'Google Drive Sync App'. Perhaps it will sync the files in questions. Since you already displaying invisible files they should show up.\n", "Q: Recover accidentally deleted files from iCloud Is there a way to recover files deleted from iCloud if an offline iPad still has them locally?\nWould renaming the local files on the iPad prevent them from being deleted once the iPad is synced?\n\nA: You could simply login to iCloud.com to recover that file. Under iCloud Settings (by clicking your name in the top-right corner) you will find a section named Advanced. Simply click Restore Files under Advanced to open the Recently Deleted File browser.\n\n\nA: I was able to recover the files by first of all renaming them on the iPad to prevent accidentally syncing the deletion and then following the iTunes document transfer procedure as described on the Apple support page:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open Numbers on your device, then do one of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If the spreadsheet is open: Tap the More button , then tap Send a Copy.\n  \n*If the spreadsheet is closed: Tap Share button  in the spreadsheet manager, tap Send a\n  Copy, then tap the spreadsheet you want to transfer.\n  \n  \n*Tap the spreadsheet format you want to export: Numbers, PDF, Excel, or CSV.\n  \n*Tap iTunes.\n  \n*Connect your iOS device to your computer (or use iTunes Wi-Fi Sync),\n  then open iTunes on your computer.

All files have different extensions, and also have periods throughout the name. It need to run as either a shell script or AppleScript, as it will be running under launchd after the initial move is done for automated moves of files. Is there a good way to go about this? (Even not using AppleScript). I don’t mind using the shell or any other method that is suggested. \nI found this post on StackOverflow, but could not make too much sense of it, as it seemed to just generate errors. Any help is appreciated. The files have alphanumeric sequences and random characters in the names (I think this is what is catching in AppleScript.\nEdit: Sorry for the wait... was at work.\nHave something like:\nMovies\n    |- Anchorman.mkv\n    |- Big Buck Bunny.mov\n    |- Spy.mp4\n    |- Shawshank Redemption.avi\n\nAnd I would like the result:\nMovies \n   |- Anchorman *\"This is a folder\"*\n       |- Anchorman.mkv *\"This is the file\"*\n   |- Big Buck Bunny\n       |- Big Buck Bunny.mov\n   |- Spy\n       |- Spy.ext\n   |- Shawshank Redemption [1994](1080p)\n       |- Shawshank Redemption [1994](1080p).avi\n\n\nA: I'll assume that all 408 are in the same folder and it have extension. Something like this:\nFolder\n|- File1.ext\n|- File2.ext\n|- File3.ext\n|- File4.ext\n\nAnd you want the following result:\nFolder \n|- File1 *\"This is a folder\"*\n   |- File1.ext *\"This is the file\"*\n|- File2\n   |- File2.ext\n|- File3\n   |- File3.ext<br>\n|- File4<br>\n   |- File4.ext<br>\n\nIf that's the case you can do it with the terminal with the following command (execute it inside the folder where the files are stored. It will fail creating the folder for the files without extension):\nfor FILE in *; do FOLDER=$(echo $FILE | sed 's/\\.[A-Za-z0-9]*$//'); mkdir \"$FOLDER\"; mv \"$FILE\" \"$FOLDER\" ; done\n\n\nA: As others have responded, it's hard to know exactly what you're looking for without the details. This AppleScript should be a good starting point, and you can tweak it to your needs. It will prompt you to identify a folder that holds the files you want to put into subfolders. I've put a property at top called removePeriods, which you can set to true or false (no quotes). If that's true, it will remove all periods from the file name and use that name to create a folder. Of course, you can tweak that to be any punctuation you would like. You could further have it strip other punctuation as well.  Finally, it takes the file and moves it into the new folder. \nproperty rootFolder : \"\"\nproperty removePeriods : true\n\n--Assuming all the files you want to move are in one folder.\nif rootFolder is \"\" then\n    set rootFolder to choose folder\nend if\n\n--Get a list of every visible file in the folder (assuming you don't want to process hidden files)\ntell application \"System Events\" to set myFiles to ¬\nevery file in rootFolder whose visible is true\n\nrepeat with aFile in myFiles\n    --Get the file name\n    set aName to name of aFile\n    --If removePeriods property above is set to true, take all the periods out of the file name\n    if removePeriods then\n        set tid to text item delimiters\n        set text item delimiters to \".\"\n        if (count of text items of aName) is greater than 2 then\n            set aName to text items 1 through ((count of text items of aName) - 1) of aName\n        else\n            set aName to text item 1 of aName\n        end if\n        set text item delimiters to tid\n        set aName to every item of aName as text\n    end if\n\n--Make a new folder with the name of the file, inside the rootFolder (the original folder you selected\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set newFolder to make new folder at rootFolder with properties {name:aName}\n    move (aFile as alias) to newFolder\nend tell\n\nend repeat\n\nIf you have folder within folders, that's another level but can be done with another loop. If you want all the new folders with files in them to go to a new place, you'd just need to add that path. If you want to strip only the name before the first punctuation mark to make the folder, you could set aName to the first text item only. You'd probably also want to add a check to make sure there isn't already a folder by the name that you are creating.\nEDIT: At the request of another user, I'm adding a note to clarify why I set rootFolder to a property rather than a standard variable. In the photo above, it appears that all the OP's files are in the movies folder. A property, in AppleScript (and in simple terms), is a variable that is saved (stored) between runs. It will be saved until the script is compiled again, at which time it will be set back to \"\". A normal variable will have no memory of a previous run of the script. I chose to make rootFolder a property so that the user wouldn't have to manually select the folder to process on each run, just the first run. However, you could replace the beginning of the script through the 'end if' with the following two lines of code:\nset rootFolder to choose folder\nset removePeriods to true\n\nYou could also hardcode the path to the folder rather than have the user select it. There are many options. I should also say again that this is not a finished script intended for final use, I created it as a place to start. However, I have used this foundation as a part of a much larger, more complicated script, to reorganize upwards of 500,000 files grouped into uniquely named folders, so I'm confident in the structure.\n", "Q: How to reliably migrate emails from Mac Mail to Google mail? A client has Google Mail on their Mac Mail app. All their emails have been stored within folders in the \"On My Mac\" section, so the emails were being removed from the Google mailbox. The mailbox is 11GB. Their internet connection is around 40/20Mb.\nThey now want their emails put back on Google Mail.\nThe client had started to move some of the 100+ folders themselves, but noticed that the message count would first appear to be correct, but then it would lose about 15 emails or so in every folder. \nThat issue seemed to have resolved itself, so now we tried to copy all 100+ folders over to Google, but then it says an error that a folder already exists and it stops. This is odd as previously, it seemed to just merge existing folders. So now I'm trying one folder at a time. Mac Mail shows that the emails are on Google, but when I go to Google Mail on the browser and check the folder, it is empty. \nIs there a better way to migrate the emails? We've spent 4+ hours on this already and Apple were unable to help with it. \nEdit: This is a nightmare! After copying all the folders again, Google place all the emails in the \"Drafts\" folder on Google mail, but on Mac Mail, it doesn't show them there at all. \n\nA: I think that the main Issue is the Import process into Gmail which has several restrictions, f.e. Bandwidth-Limitations, and automated functions, f.e. automated filtering, labeling and sorting.\nFirst of all, with 11GB of mail you need Patience!!!! \nGoogle Infrastructure has a bandwidth-Limitation on Traffic, see Google Support here for details. As mentioned there, 500MB IMAP Upload/per Day is not much and considering the amount you are planning to upload will result in quite some Migration Time.\nAnother point would be the rebuild and reindexing of the Apple Mail Mailboxes, see the Apple Support page here. Only the you can be (reasonably) sure that the Mailcount is correct.\nAnother Recommendation: While Migrating, make sure that the Account is not in use by other Clients!!!! There are several Issues in which multiple access to an IMAP Account can result in conflicting operations and filtering. \nAlso, try not to repeat the same procedure to often - Google has a limitation there (see earlier mentioned Support page from Google)\nThat's all very general, but i think you should be aware of the limitations first before planning and executing a Migration of that scale. Letting your Client start something like that and trying to fix the Problems resulting from 'simply copying mails' does not work on that scale. \n", "Q: Why are regular Folders in Smart Folders not showing up in Open File dialogs?

I would like to avoid creating Purchase Items for every amount I want to use.\n\nA: No, in-app purchases can only have predefined prices set in iTunes Connect. You can charge the same in-app purchase multiple times, meaning you can calculate the donation to the nearest Tier 1 multiple and repeatedly charge it, but you can’t have custom tiers.

I can hear it reading the CD, but after a minute or two, it goes dormant.\nNext up, a USB memory stick that has an El Capitan installer on it. (I've used the stick to install El Capitan on a number of other Macs, but not this one).  I get the gray screen, the Apple logo, followed by a progress bar as the MBP boots from the USB drive. The activity light on the USB stick blinks away as its files are accessed. The progress bar gets about 3/4 of the way through, then it stops.  No further activity.\nNext -- boot into single-user mode (Cmd-S). This works fine. Once in single-user mode, I was able to do an fsck scan of the internal drive. I could list files, repair permissions, empty caches, and various other low-level operations. But after exiting out of single-user mode, it still doesn't boot from the hard drive.\nMy last test was to boot from a FixMeStick. FMS is a commercial anti-virus scanner on a USB stick. I believe it's built on a Debian kernel.  The FMS booted with no problems, and then proceeded to scan the entire contents of the internal HD looking for viruses.  This took a few hours, which is quite normal. At the end, FMS reported no viruses found. While the MBP is unhappy with Apple boot software, it has no objections to running this particular Linux system.\nThe behavior when booting from the FMS system (and when in single-user mode) suggests that the MBP is fundamentally healthy: mobo OK, HD OK, HD controller OK. I haven't tried swapping the memory, but I doubt that FMS would run successfully (and for hours) if the memory was flaky.\nWhat other troubleshooting steps could I try before consigning this MBP to the silicon graveyard?\n\nOP with an update on my MBP boot problem:\nI swapped the 2x2GB memory modules (after-market RAM) with the original 2x1GB modules that shipped with it.  No change.\nAs discussed in the comments, I located the Apple 10.5 distro CDs that came with this early-2008 MBP. With Install Disk 1 in the optical drive, a boot-D brought up AHT.  AHT appeared to test the memory successfully, but when it progressed to the Logic Board test, AHT froze with the progress bar at about 95%.  The cursor was frozen, and AHT made no further progress after 10 minutes of waiting.   The version of AHT that’s on the 10.5 distro is 3A152.\nIn order to rule out a defective Install Disk and/or faulty optical drive, I built a bootable USB stick containing AHT (using the F42C89C8 AHT module posted on the Github AHT repository). The version of AHT that gets installed on the USB stick was 3A134.  When that older version of AHT runs, it quickly reports a problem:\n   Error:  4VDC/1/40000003: video controller\nMs. Google tells me that 2008-09 vintage Macs were frequently plagued by a faulty NVIDIA GeForce 8600M video controller. Apple had an extended warranty program for the defect, which is now long since expired. Seems the chip (or its BGA contacts) in my MBP has finally failed. Oddly, the Mac has never exhibited any video problems. Nor is it now — no glitches, no funny lines, no jittering.\nI find it odd that my Debian-based FixMeStick runs just fine. It has a basic GUI that displays menu bar, graphics, buttons, scrolling windows, and the like. Perhaps its video driver is less demanding of the GeForce 8600M.\nIt appears that this MBP has come to the end of its service life. Maybe I can find a way to install a Linux distro on it, or harvest it for parts.\n\nA: The OP answers his own question, which was \"what other troubleshooting steps could I try...\".\nHere are the steps that led me to an unhappy conclusion.\n1) Try booting while holding the D key, hoping to get into AHT.  My MBP had 10.6.8 on it. That system either has no built-in diagnostics installed (the AHT software lives in /System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostic), or the version that's there is not compatible with this MBP(4,1)\n2) Try boot-D with Apple 10.6 distro DVD in the optical drive.  Same finding as (1) above.\n3) Try boot-D with the OSX CDs that shipped with the MBP (OSX 10.5).  The Install 1 CD contains AHT software which is compatible with the MBP, and the AHT environment starts up.  However, after testing the memory, AHT hangs with the progress bar at 95%, and reports no errors.  The version of AHT which is on the 10.5 Install 1 CD is 3A152\n4) Download an older version of AHT (3A134) from Github here:\nhttps://github.com/upekkha/AppleHardwareTest\nThis version will boot the MBP. It tests the memory, then reports an error with the video controller:  4VDC/1/40000003\nI haven't found any 'workarounds' for what appears to be a bad NVIDIA graphics chip. Ms. Google reports that some people have been able to fix this problem by baking the main logic board to reflow the BGA solder bonds to the graphics chip. (this requires total disassembly of the MacBook).  Another 'fix' is to replace the main logic board. Neither seem attractive on a 9-year old computer.\nHowever, I have found a possible path which may keep this MBP out of the landfill for a while longer. I downloaded the latest version of Linux Mint, burned a LiveCD, and booted from it.  Unlike OSX, Mint starts up and runs. However, it displays a warning advising that it is using software implementation for graphics that will consume lots of CPU. I surmise that the Mint start-up code detected that the NVIDIA graphics chip was malfunctioning and bypassed it. So the MBP may live on as a headless server, running Mint or some other Linux distro.\nThanks to Allan for responding to my query and pointing me at AHT on OSX distribution disks... \n", "Q: What is the difference between `IO` and `Data` in the Activity Monitor?

I take my Macbook out and about during the day and I'm often connected to my phone for internet access.  I'm always careful to not watch videos or start any large downloads until I get home for obvious reasons.  However, on numerous occasions I've got home, and started to use the internet freely, only to then realise I forgot to manually connect to my home (unlimited) network--that is to say I'm still connected to my mobile phone, blazing through my monthly allowance in no time.  \nIs there any way to get my Mac to automatically (or perhaps with a prompt) disconnect to whatever network is was connected to, and connect to the new, designated network, whenever it comes into range?  \n\nA: It sounds like you may have the phone-hotspot network prioritized over your home wireless network. You can change this in System Preferences -> Network pane -> Wi-Fi service -> Advanced button -> Wi-Fi tab -> Preferred Networks list. Just click and drag to put your home network above the phone hotspot, and when it sees both it'll automatically choose the home network.\nNote that this will not trigger a change whenever the home network comes into range, so it's not quite what you asked for. But it will re-scan and re-choose whenever it wakes from sleep, so if you put it to sleep on your way home (i.e. close the lid), it'll re-scan and choose the home network when you wake it back up.\n\nA: In case anyone still interested in this, I wrote a service utilizing shell script to automatically connect to hotspot. Star if you like it.\nhttps://github.com/OnDaShouldersOfGiants/auto-hotspot\n\nA: For Hotspot connection use TripMode.To connect automatically to your home WiFi use Keyboard Maestro macro and/or Automator.\n", "Q: Disable Two-Factor Authentication for macOS? How to disable Apple’s Two-Factor Authentication for macOS? \nOlder Macs do not support Two-Factor Authentication. As a side-effect, a user cannot access their iTunes account in iTunes on any older Mac, and cannot buy music.\n\nA: Two-Factor Authentication is applied at the account level, not at the device level. So you can either remove it entirely from your iCloud account, or you’ll have to use it on all of your devices equally.\nIf it worked any other way a hacker could simply pick the least secure entry point to attack your account.\nThankfully you can still login on an older device, even with Two-Factor Authentication enabled.\nFirst, login using your regular credentials, just as you would on a system that did support Two-Factor Authentication. An authentication code will be sent to all your Trusted Devices. Now simply login again, this time appending your authentication code to your password.\nFor instance if your account is basil@icloud.com, your password 123apple and your authentication code 456789, then you would login using the following credentials:\nbasil@icloud.com  \n123apple456789\n\nYou can read up more about this at Two-factor authentication for Apple ID:\n\nWhat if I use two-factor authentication on a device running older software?\nIf you use two-factor authentication with devices running\nolder OS versions, you might be asked to add your six-digit\nverification code to the end of your password when signing in.

I'm having trouble with directories I'm creating on an hfs+ partition (created with gparted, so I can see files on it when booted into OS X). I'm assuming the confusion has to do with the hfs+ format being case-insensitive, but then, shouldn't it really be case insensitive, whether I'm working on it via Ubuntu or OS X? Here's the scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created directory \"DropBox\" via Nautilus.\n\n*Tried to rename \"DropBox\" to \"Dropbox\" but got error message: 'The item could not be renamed. The name \"Dropbox\" is already in use...'.\n\n*Tried deleting \"DropBox\" (permanently, not to Trash) and creating new directory \"Dropbox\". When I did that, both directories appeared (\"DropBox\" and \"Dropbox\").\n\n*Tried deleting \"DropBox\", but both directories were deleted.\nLooked in Terminal; while both \"DropBox\" and \"Dropbox\" are visible in Nautilus, running `ls -a shows only \"DropBox\".\n\n*Still in Terminal, deleted \"DropBox\" (rm -R DropBox). As expected, this resulted in there being no dropbox folder of any sort. However, in Nautilus, I still see \"Dropbox\", until I try to open it, at which time I get an error that says it doesn't really exist, and then it disappears from Nautilus, too.\n\n*In Terminal, re-create the directory (mkdir Dropbox). The directory is recreated as \"DropBox\" again, and shows up as such in Nautilus as well.\n\n\nHere is the mount options for the drive: /dev/sdb2 on /data type hfsplus (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,umask=22,uid=0,gid=0,nls=utf8)\nDropbox is not yet synced to this directory, so I know it has nothing to do with Dropbox.\nIs there any way around this issue, or is it unavoidable when using hfs+?\n\nA: After digging around further, I found the solution to this issue. It is actually possible to format an hfs+ partition in OS X as case-sensitive, unjournaled, though it takes two steps. There's no way to switch an existing case-insensitive partition to case-sensitive.\nThe option to disable journaling (or to format a vol as case-sensitive, not journaled) has been removed from the OS X Disk Utility in El Capitan (which is the version I'm running) but it can still be done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Depending on how the disk is partitioned, it might be necessary to carve out the disk space first on Linux (using gparted is the easiest way). I'm fairly sure it doesn't matter what type of partition, but just to be careful, I created it as hfs+ to make sure there were no weird access issues on the OS X side.\n\n*In OS X, use Disk Utility to format the partition as HFS+ Case-Sensitive, Journaled. (It should be possible to do in Terminal using diskutil, as well, but I didn't want to take the time to hunt down the syntax for case-sensitivity).\n\n*Still in OS X, in Terminal, run diskutil disableJournal /dev/volname. You can run this with the disk mounted or unmounted. (If you're not sure of the disk or volume name, diskutil list will list them all).\n\n\nSide note: From the number of posted questions on the subject, it appears that mounting hfs+ as rw in Ubuntu is problematic for many. The syntax for designating mount of an hfs+ partition as rw in fstab (/etc/fstab is used by the system to mount devices at boot) is UUID=<UUID> /mountpoint hfsplus rw,exec,auto,users 0 0, assuming you want the typical options for a non-system data vol. If you want something different, this article is really helpful. You will also probably need to chown -R user /mountpoint the mountpoint.\nAnd that's it. I tested it out back in Ubuntu, using the same \"DropBox\" name change test I used before, and it all looks good.\n", "Q: How do I stop email addresses from spam autocompleting in Apple Mail? Every single time I open an email to address to my mom, I see this, and absolutely nothing I've tried will get rid of it:\n\nThis is absolutely ridiculous. I don't want to see porn spam in my auto complete addresses! There has GOT to be a way to turn this off!\nI've gone so far as to search for and eliminate every trace of every email originating from that address in my inbox, junk and trash, quit and restarted Mail and it's still there.\nUpdate: It looks like I may have finally solved this by some obscure post I found on the web. In short, I had to open the Contacts app and disable \"Show contacts found in Apps\". It seems there was some kind of heinous loop happening here: Contacts was automatically finding contacts based on the emails I received, and Mail was apparently using my Contacts to auto-fill that address, but there was no setting anywhere in Mail to control this!\n\nA: One possible option is to delete the file that stores all that data. That file is stored on:\n/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/\n\nThere is a file called:  MailRecents-v4.abcdmr\nSeems like that file stores all the autocomplete address.\nIf you delete that file you will lose all others previous recipents address. So I'll follow the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Mail.app: Menu Window > Previous Recipents. There copy all address that you don't have stored in your contacts and you want to keep\n\n*Close Mail.app\n\n*Backup MailRecents-v4.abcdmr file by copying it to desktop (for example)\n\n*Delete all files called MailRecents-v4.abcdmr stored on /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/ folder. You will see another MailRecents-v4.abcdmr-* files. They store other info of the autocomplete address.\n\n*Open Mail.app and try to create an email.\n\n\nPS: If something goes wrong opening the Mail.app on the step 5., restore the backup files that you copy to the desktop.\n\nA: So what finally ended up working for me (I tried a lot of things believe me) was to follow the instructions on this web page.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Contacts app\n\n*Open Contacts Preferences (cmd-,)\n\n*Under the General tab uncheck \"Show contacts found in Apps\"\n\n\nIt seems that the Contacts app was collecting email addresses from mail I had received and automatically added implicit contacts to my address book, which Mail was sourcing for its autocomplete.\nIt finally seems to be gone now, but it had been that way for close to a year, believe it or not.

So deleting a thread on one device will NOT affect other devices. You can safely delete this conversation from your iPhone, and it will stay on your Mac.\nDo note that coming in iOS 11 is iCloud Messages, which will synchronize your text conversations across devices. If you enable this feature, previously deleted conversations from one device will return to that device if they still exist on another.

This should keep a thief or anyone who finds the phone from accessing your personal data.

This also happens when my phone is both locked and unlocked.\nI am running iOS 10.3.3, but it's been happening for some time. Is there a workaround to fix this?\n\nA: This is how Do Not Disturb was designed for text conversations. This feature blocks sound notifications and that’s it.\nIn fact, it works the same way the global Do Not Disturb works, with one major difference: going into Settings → Do Not Disturb and setting Silence to Always does NOT block banners or alerts for muted threads. The only way to disable those is by disabling them for ALL incoming text messages, or by activating the global Do Not Disturb.\nIf you are displeased with Apple’s implementation of this feature and believe it should work differently, I strongly advise you to voice your feedback to Apple.\nMany people would agree with you, as a quick search will reveal.\n", "Q: Remove missing drive from Spotlight I was cloning someone's drive, it was named Macintosh HD, just like my my own.

Now, for various reasons, I would like to use the Aura SSD as an external drive. Is there any enclosure available which is compatible with it? Apparently, the Envoy enclosure it was delivered with is not - it is only intended to be used with the original Apple SSD. I found the following disclaimer in the product description:\n\n\"Important Note: The OWC Envoy enclosure has been specifically\n  designed for use ONLY with the factory SSD found installed in Apple\n  MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina display mid-2013 and later\n  models. Do NOT attempt to install or use the OWC Aura SSD in the Envoy\n  as you can damage the Aura drive, the Envoy enclosure or both and such\n  damage is not covered under warranty.\"\n\nOWC Aura SSD product description\n\nA: This is the answer I just got asking OWC why you can't use their Envoy enclosure with an Aura drive:\n\nThey use a different voltage than the Apple drives.  Using them\n  together may cause damage to the drive, enclosure, or both.\nSincerely,\n  Duane C. Customer Experience\n\nI'm not sure I believe that. I would believe the heat issue. \n\nA: This enclosure works with various Aura models (not sure which one yours is). You can check if yours is compatible :\nhttps://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/MAU3ENP1AW/\nIt is made by OWC itself and looks the same.\nYou can ask support if your drive is compatible, otherwise OWC seems to have a number of enclosure variants which are compatible with different kinds of drives.\n\nA: As far as I know, there's no such enclosure on the market today.\nThe reason behind the disclaimer is that the OWC drive produces more heat than the Apple-supplied drive. The enclosure simply does not cool the OWC sufficiently.\nYou could add some custom cooling to the enclosure (or simply not put on the lid), and make sure that the temperature stays within specs.\n\nA: The CY USB 3.0 to 17+7pin SSD HDD to SATA 22Pin Hard Disk Cartridge Drive for Macbook Air Pro MD223 MD224 MD231 MD232 SSD available on Amazon for $16 worked for me. I had removed my OWC Aura 480 gb SSD from my mid-2012 Air that I was selling. As OWC stated, the Envoy would not work, but took a chance on this adapter from Amazon (which includes USB 3.0 cable worked. I plugged my USB-C adapter into the USB-3 cable and into my 2016 MacBook and DiskUtility recognized and allow me to erase and reformat as a new external drive. The adapter does not have a case...but who cares, it works and I now have 480gb's of usable SSD\n\nA: I have a \"OWC Aura\" 1st edition (not the Pro, which is a NVMe.  the older 2TB one with a power cable extended from it).     If I knew what the voltage was that I needed to provide to it, I think I could get it connected to USB and then I would be able to reformat it.    The 10.14.6 update hosed it and now when the OWC drive is connected to the computer it hangs on startup and recovery utility cannot be opened.    NOTE: When the OEM Samsung drive is installed in my \"Mac Pro\", 10.14.6 works fine and in that case booting to recovery utility works.\nSo, If I knew either the voltage OR if there was a USB adapter that might work with it, then I think I could fix the drive.\n", "Q: iPhone screen periodically unresponsive My iPhone 6 had a problem where the screen stops responding to touch for a period of time. It always becomes responsive again after a while, although sometimes it requires a power button cycling. \nFor reasons I cannot explain, I feel this is a software issue. It happens in all apps, but it seems to have a sort of schedule. \nHas anyone else an anything like this?\n\nA: No, not as a general issue across all apps.\nSome apps such as for example Safari may be \"slow to scroll\" (for example web pages that have Javascript scroll handlers that do not declare themselves as never calling preventDefault() can be slow to scroll).\nHowever, if you see this as a general problem across all apps, and you have to powercycle the phone - it sounds that a hardware problem is likely.\nIf the phone is still under warranty - take the issue to Apple Support. If it is not, you could still try Apple Support.\n\nA: This advise is only meant for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6plus. ONLY.\nIf you experience problems with your screen being unresponsive, you may suffer from a design flaw of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus that is described here.\nSo this means your phone is probably broken and has to be replaced eventually. But you can try the following for the time being. \nThis worked for my phone:\nApply some some light pressure to the case as you would pretend to twist or bend your phone. Only apply light pressure. Don't really bend it though. Just apply some pressure and check if the display is reacting again. It worked in my case. You will have to repeat this all the time it does not respond to touch. \n\nA: If this has been happening ever since you have bought your phone, it may be a hardware problem with the touchscreen.\nHowever, if has been happening recently, it may be because of the version of iOS that you are running. Make sure that you have updated to the latest stable or beta version of iOS. In addition, make sure that there are not too many background processes that are running.\n\nA: My phone acts like this immediately after doing a big operation like removing my iCloud Library or adding or removing an Exchange Email Account. I think the sheer amount of work the phone has to major deletes, uploads & downloads cause  the phone slow it down sometimes.\n", "Q: How to have a non-obvious encrypted partition on an external hard-drive with MacOS Sierra? MacOS Sierra asks for password whenever I plug in partitioned external drive which I do not want to happen.\nI have Macbook Pro 2016 running Sierra 10.12.6 with a Seagate Backup Plus Slim 2TB Portable External Hard Drive.\nI partitioned the drive with 1.2 TB for backups (Time Capsule) and 800 GB for other stuff that I can share with my friends (Tachyon).\nI ultimately want to achieve the following:\n(1) Have Time Capsule for my backups which is encrypted;\n(2) Not make it obvious that there is an encrypted partition on the drive (e.g. not have my computer ask me to type in the password everytime it's plugged in and I don't want to save the password in the keychain); and\n(3) When I am ready to do a backup or to grab something from the encrypted partition, make it available either via commandline or disk utility.\n________________________________________________________\nRight now, it asks me to type in the password everytime it is plugged in and I say cancel I don't know how to get the encrypted drive back unless I eject it and plug it back in.\n\n\nA: How To Do It - Summary\nWhat you need to do is prevent the file system from mounting that specific volume. This is typically handled by fstab, and configured via the /etc/fstab file. However, macOS (and OS X) specify a different command to correctly handle the editing of the /etc/fstab file - that is, vifs. Be warned that unless you have a default editor configured via the  EDITOR environment variable, the file editor which will be used is vi. There is additional information about vifs below, under the \"Information About the vifs Command\" heading, including how to use an editor other than vi.\nStep by Step Instructions\nThe first thing we need to do is to get the UUID of the volume(s) we want to affect. To get the UUID, the drive must be connected to the computer, and volume must already be mounted. In this case, you would need to plug in the USB drive and enable access to the volume by entering the password.\nOnce this is done, which can be verified by seeing the volume in Finder, we need to get to the terminal. In the terminal window, type the command diskutil info /Volumes/<Volume Name> | grep 'Volume UUID'. In your case, you would replace \"\" with \"Time\\ Capsule\". Note the backslash () is needed to escape special characters, such as space in this case. This should return a single line with a value similar to \"Volume UUID:              AA2313FE-7C4A-340F-8293-D74EA0ED34DE\". The UUID, which is \"AA2313FE-7C4A-340F-8293-D74EA0ED34DE\" here, is what we need. Select it, and copy it to the clipboard (⌘/Cmd+C).\nWe now need to edit the /etc/fstab file. By default, the \nFor the scope of this answer, I will assume that you are comfortable with whichever editor you are using to perform the following steps.\nStart the editor by typing sudo vifs in the terminal window. This will prompt for an administrator password to get administrative access to edit the file.\nWith the editor open, and the volume's UUID in the clipboard, we will append a line at the end of the file as follows: UUID=<Volume UUID from clipboard> /Volumes/Time\\ Machine hfs rw,noauto. You can use the terminal command man fstab to get additional options or values to use in the entry, but here, the following options and values are specified as:  \n\n\n*\n\n*/Volumes/<Volume Name - from above> Specify the mount point into which the volume is to be mounted.\n\n*hfs The file system type (Mac volumes are typically hfs - Hierarchical File System)  \n\n*rw,noauto  \n\n\n*\n\n*rw Mount as read/write when mounting  \n\n*noauto Do NOT automatically mount the volume  \n\n\n\nAfter you've added and updated the line(s) as necessary, save the file and exit the editor. To test that this has \"taken\", you can perform either a logout/login, reboot, or disconnect (eject) the disk and reconnect it. The volume should no longer be mounting or prompting for the password.\nAt a later time, when you need to mount the volume, you can return to the trusty terminal, and use the command mount /Volumes/<Volume Name>, or open Disk Utility, select the volume, and click the Mount button in the toolbar.\ntl;dr\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the volume's UUID, in the terminal, using the diskutil info /Volumes/<Volume Name> command\n\n*Use the command sudo vifs to properly (for macOS/OS X) lock and edit the /etc/fstab file\n\n*Add an entry to the /etc/fstab file for the volume, by its UUID, adding noauto to the mount options\n\n*To use/mount the Volume, use Disk Utility and the Mount options for the volume, or use mount /Volumes/<Volume Name>\nInformation About the vifs Command\nHere is what you need to know about the what and the why of the vifs command. What this command does is simply lock the /etc/fstab file for editing to the calling user, and opens the file in vi (explaining the vi in vifs), or the editor (command) specified system's defined EDITOR environment variable. While we could directly edit the /etc/fstab file, using the vifs command is the only method recommended/approved by Apple.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Previous answer to a somewhat similar question  \n\n*Example on iDownloadBlog  \n\n*Apple's vifs documentation\n", "Q: Add text captions/subtitles to videos without Adobe Premiere?

Nothing happens. I'm able to slide down the Notification Center and type and search in the box but then I try to open an app and nothing happens.\nIf I press and hold to activate Siri, she appears for a second then turns off as if I pressed the home button again.\nI've tried connecting the iPhone to a Mac but as it's passcode enabled it tells me to unlock it and then replug it which I'm not able to do.\n\nA: If Siri starts but then stops \"as if [you] pressed the Home button again\", I'd say there might be a problem with your Home Button. Try using the Apple earphones with volume/play control and use that to press Home button for Siri. Does Siri still behave the same way?\n\nA: Unless the power or home button is broken, holding both will restart the device. Hold both buttons until the Apple logo is shown; it will take numerous seconds but be patient. This is definitely a step to take first before you start disassembling your device to access the battery.\n", "Q: Is it safe to give my MacBook to a service center with my data on it? I have to give my Macbook Pro to a service center for a few days to replace the display. Is it safe from the data perspective? Can they access it? (user login is password protected, but I think the data is not encrypted) Can they just take hard drive and copy everything? What should I do to avoid it?\n\nA: Often a service center need access to the Mac to verify if the problems are solved. You can do a few things.\n\n\n*\n\n*The most important thing first. Make a backup from all your data before you give your Mac to the service center.\n\n*Turn on FileVault. It encrypts the harddisk.\n\n*Make a second user and provide these details to the service center so they can test.\n\n\nA: I would (and did) make two separate backups on different drives.\nThen I removed all my data (no I did not go through the process of writing 0's 7 or 35 times) and sent my Imac in.\nThey sorted the display issue and it came back corrected.\nRe-installed data and all was fine.\n\nA: Much of what was wrote about trusting the Genius Bar applies to any service center. \n\n\n*\n\n*Can I trust Apple Store's employees with my laptop?\nWhat contract is in place? What damage is done if you have confidential or private information? There are some cases where a hardware failure is hard to test or reproduce from a clean install without a defined minimal test case of data or setup, so it could be in your interest to not wipe your data. \nIn your case - wiping it for a display swap seems prudent if you have any doubts that your data shouldn’t be shared. \n", "Q: I can't restore back up from PC.

But if I do that Finder thinks it's some sort of a system file and not a directory. The same goes with *.framework. Is there some setting in Finder to turn off this behaviour?\n\nA: My solution is to use an underscore. I wanted to have folders like:\ndomainname.com\n domainname.cc\nto store local versions of websites I deploy.\nBut have settled with underscore instead. That means I don't have to worry about the mac thinking these folders are actually files of some specific type.  If I used .cc, there's a risk the mac would think that folder is a c++ source file :)  So, I'm happy with:\ndomainname_com\n domainname_cc \nsuch that I know I don't have to worry about that.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra: Increase mouse cursor speed beyond System Preferences maximum I previously used BetterTouchTool to override the maximum mouse cursor speed in System Preferences. However, as of macOS Sierra, this is no longer possible according to the developer (source).\nI am not sure if this is due to a technical limitation on part of the application, or if it indeed is impossible to override the maximum mouse cursor speed.\nNote that I am referring explicitly to the Mouse cursor speed – not the Trackpad cursor. I am looking to increase the cursor speed of my Logitech Performance Mouse MX (without the use of Logitech Control Center!).\nSo the question is: How can the maximum mouse cursor speed be overridden (with a permanent setting) in macOS Sierra? Perhaps it could be done by a Terminal command or editing a plist file, but the solution could entail a third-party app.\n\nA: My system runs 10.12.6. I used to use usboverdrive.com for this, but found that (somehow) it interfered with Safari 11's cascading bookmark menus. Removing usboverdrive removed the menu issue.\nInstead, I'm now using http://www.plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/. Steermouse also allows one to accelerate tracking speed.

It gets installed in preferences pane.\n\n\nA: I tried using this utility (http://triq.net/mac/mouse-acceleration) with a Dell Mouse, and it seems to help increase the tracking speed of a mouse or trackpad beyond the default maximum value (up to 6 times).

This is because your DCHP client is going to attempt to request the lease it had previously so long as it hasn't expired.  You have to force the client to ask for a new lease.\n$ sudo ipconfig set <interface> BOOTP\n$ sudo ipconfig set <interface> DHCP\n\nAdditionally, you can use the networksetup command\n$ networksetup -setdhcp <networkservice> \n$ networksetup -setbootp <networkservice>\n\nYou would get the networkservice by issuing the command:\n$ networksetup -listallnetworkservices\n\nOf course, you could also do this in Network Preferences\n\n", "Q: Beta to regular I need some advice. I have my Macbook running MacOS High Sierra Version 10.13 Beta. I'd like to downgrade to MacOS Sierra, can someone please help me with resources, a link, or anything similar?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there's no simple 'Revert' option. You cannot go 'downhill' even using Time Machine, unless you swapped out your Time Machine drive right before the update - it simply won't let you.\nYour only option is from the App Store, using your Purchase History to find the previous OS installer; download, make a bootable USB key & start afresh from there. iCloud ought to be able to sync, & you will be able to use Time Machine to pull some data back, but it will not be seamless.\nAs a cautionary tale, I'll link to my trials & tribulations trying to revert from Sierra to El Capitan, which even with multiple backups wasn't painless - Revert to El Capitan\n", "Q: Detect fn and function key simultaneously pressed I am using ControllerMate to try to change what my volume buttons do.\nUnfortunately, I haven't figured out how I can detect that the F11 or F12 keys are being pressed at the same time as the fn key.\nOriginally I'd planned to combine an F11 keypress detector and an AppleScript that checks for the fn key.\n\nI haven't been able to find a way in AppleScript to detect the fn key. Research led me to possible solutions, such as\ndo shell script \"/usr/bin/python -c 'import Cocoa; print Cocoa.NSEvent.modifierFlags()'\"\n\nBut this can't distinguish between the different function keys or fn.\nAfter almost a week trying to figure this out myself I ask you; is there a way to detect in ControllerMate a simultaneous fn and function key press?\n\nA: I found a way to do this that uses the awesome Karabiner-Elements. This has been so useful for me in many situations, and it works here too.\nKarabiner can detect function keys being pressed, and tell whether it's with or without the fn key modifier.\nWe can make our own \"Complex modification\" that takes advantage of this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Complex modifications are stored in ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications as json files.

Select Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the format list. Then, click the Erase button. When the process is complete, click Done, and close the Disk Utility window.\n\n*If your drive is named something else, you need to rename it (Open Finder -> right click on the USB drive and choose Rename).\n\nNow, your USB flash drive is ready.\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal (Finder/Applications/Utilities/Terminal)\n\n\n*Enter the following text into Terminal. It may be best to just copy it from here (try triple-clicking) and paste it in.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app --nointeraction\n\n\n*Hit the Enter key.\n\n\n*Terminal will ask you for an admin password (the one you use to log in). It won’t display characters when you type, so just do it. Hit Return. You’ll see that Terminal erases your drive. Then, Terminal will copy the installer file to your disk. This will take a few minutes. When the process is complete, the Terminal window will report \"Done.\" You can quit Terminal and your bootable macOS Sierra installer USB drive is ready for use.\n \n\n\n*Plug in the bootable macOS Sierra installer USB drive to your Mac.\n\n*Restart your Mac while holding the Option key or Cmd+R.

I would like to take a Time Machine backup, under a folder called \"Backups.backupdb\" and click and drag it into Google Drive. I am wondering if this process will cause any hard links or anything like that to be deleted? My question basically is, if I were to upload it to Google Drive, then download it in the future, would it be readily usable as a backup to restore a computer?\n\nA: A copy operation doesn't change the source, so if you copy a timestamped folder from within Backups.backupdb the Time Machine backup itself will not be touched, and you theoretically get a full backup copied into Google Drive.\nEmphasis is on theoretical though, because\n\n*\n\n*you may not have read permissions on some files/directories in a TM backup\n\n*Google Drive may not support all file/directory attributes and ACLs required for a TM backup to be stored.\n\nEven if you can overcome these obstacles one way or the other, you basically face the same issues again if you want to move the backup back from Google Drive into TM. And with TM being rather picky about access rights etc the chance that you afterwards can restore from such a backup is rather small.\nYou may be better off using SuperDuper!/Carbon Copy Cloner to create a full image on an external drive now and then.\n", "Q: Can I get iTunes to stop updating a specific app? The Weber iGrill iOS app dropped support for my model of thermometer. I didn't realize this until I had already updated the app. I was able to delete the new version and restore the old version from a backup, copy it to iTunes and sync it to my iPhone. (I still sync my iPhone through iTunes, not OTA.)\nIs there a way to tell iTunes to ignore updates for this one app? Otherwise I have to update apps one-by-one instead of clicking Update All Apps.\nI'm running macOS 10.12.6 and iTunes 12.6.2.20.\n\nA: There is no directly supported way to exclude apps from update. You either can Update All or update one-by-one.\nThat said, there are a few things you could try. Depending on how many apps are being updated, if it's more than three, the app in question could be queued for download when you click Update All instead of starting immediately. If so, simply remove it from the queue. Similarly, depending on the app's size, it may not download instantaneously so you could cancel the download of it after clicking Update All.\nYou could use something like Little Snitch to block connections from iTunes, hit Update All, remove the app in question from the list, then reenable connections. Might not work depending on what Update All actually does with network connections. I haven't tested it. If you want to go this route, you could use the answer to this question about the domains for Apple's app CDN to only block the domains which contain the app data, and not control servers which might be used when you click Update All.\nFinally, you could try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the good version of the app from the iTunes Media folder (usually at ~/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications unless you moved either the iTunes or iTunes Media folders) to a safe location like the desktop\n\n*Update All in iTunes.\n\n*Remove the bad app version from iTunes.\n\n*Re-add the good app version from the desktop by dragging it into iTunes.\n\n", "Q: Numbers: Is it possible to import animated gifs?

As soon as I am sure, I will post my solution there.\nI am now getting the sort of behaviour I expect from Time Machine (proper incremental backups) but it seems to skip some backups.\nI found this morning, that it had not backed up overnight, and I found this afternoon, when I got home from work, that it had backed up this morning, but not during the day.\nThe iMac was put to sleep, and, obviously, there was no activity to warrant more backups. However, the control panel does say the it keeps “Hourly backups for the past 24 hours”, and that’s clearly not what’s happening.\nThe question is, is this the correct behaviour of Time Machine: only making backups when the machine has been busy? This would imply that the message is not quite correct.\n\nA: Time Machine backs up only the files that changed since the previous backup, to make future backups much faster, if nothing has changed on the Mac or the computer has been asleep then there's nothing to warrant a backup. \n\nA: I have found this link: FlexiTime Machine: how Sierra changes backups\nIn it, there is a discussion of how Sierra appears to have changed how the scheduling works. It seems that TM is more discriminating about when to make a backup, and if, for example, there have been no changes since the last backup, then it just won’t bother. The Hourly Backups message is out of date.\nThe article also goes on to say that this seems to unannounced.

I'm having trouble finding documentation - is that setup supposed to work? If so, what should I check?\n\nA: That's the way it's \"supposed\" to work, but judging by the reviews on both Apple's own website and on Amazon, (two and three stars respectively), it's not doing so well.\n\n\nThere is however, the Cable Matters Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt Adapter that gets high reviews though (IMO) is not as good looking as the Apple design.  Though for me, it could look like a brick as long as it worked.\nThat said, generally speaking, I don't like converting signals, it's just another potential point of failure; instead I like going from \"native connection to native connection\" so it not only reduces the number of physical conversions, but the protocol conversions as well.  While this will be a sore spot with many of Apple customers that invested heavily in adapters for their previous generation MacBooks, the consensus is that USB-C is here to stay.\nYour best bet is to put those older adapters up on eBay and get new ones.  \n", "Q: Can I backup my whatsapp data from an iOS 8 device and use it on an iOS 7 Device? I used to have an iPhone 4s which is broken now, and I got an iPhone 4 from a friend who doesn't need it anymore. I made a backup off my whatsapp chats via iCloud Drive (which doesn't exist on iOS 7), so I can't use them on the iPhone 4. By reading the Whatsapp FAQ I get the impression that this might be completely impossible. Is there any way I can have my chats on the iOS 7 device? It doesn't have to be via iCloud, and I don't mind investing some time to try a few things. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Conventionally there is no way to do this between the devices but you can access WhatsApp chat logs via many of the various \"iCloud Recovery Tools\" out there. Syncios is the one that I use but it's around $50 (trial might do it for free) for a subscription but it does allow you to export those chat logs (I think to an XML off the top of my head). They're a dime a dozen those programs so you'll find one that suits you if it's the route you wish to take. They will require that Two Factor Authentication is disabled.\nSure you won't have them available on the device but you will in the short term have a copy of them for reference. \n", "Q: More rigid Apple USB-C to cable I own two USB C to C cables from Apple. One of which I bought about half a year ago (this one) and one that came with my MacBook Pro 13 (Mid 2017). I've noticed that the cable that came with the MacBook Pro has feels a lot more rigid, thicker and plugs into my devices a lot smoother than the older cable. \nDoes anyone know whether they updated the old USB C to C cable to this more rigid version or is it still the old one? (Or is the more rigid version exclusive to MacBook Pros?)\n\nA: There is no way to ensure that you will get a specific cable design (for lack of a better word) when ordering an Apple cable. I'd suggest finding a third-party cable you like and sticking with it. I personally use the Amazon Basics cables (Lightning to USB-A, not USB-C, though) and have had no issues with them. I have found them to be much more rigid and thick than the Apple cables and therefore they last a lot longer.\n", "Q: Can I install Mac OS from another account?

Is this legal?\n\n\nA: Yes, if one of your account do has the installer in the Purchase list, you can download them and use it on your Mac Mini. However, you can’t just install it on top of Sierra. You needs to wipe the drive or use a separate partition.\nIf you downloaded the installer, it’s perfectly fine to use it on multiple machines.\n", "Q: Playlist ascending / descending resetting I'm using iTunes version 12.6.2.20 (latest) with a combination of local music, Apple Music, and iCloud Music Library.\nIn iTunes, all playlists are always sorted correctly except for \"Current Favourites\" which is supposed to be sorted ascending but always reverts to descending on restart of iTunes or the PC. This ascending / descending reversion affects all playlists.\nOn my iPhone, the playlists are always sorted correctly including \"Current Favourites\".\nWhat could cause this?\n\nA: It seems that upgrading to version 12.7.0.166 and/or using option View | Show View Options | Sort By has resolved the issue.\n", "Q: High Sierra: Can't merge BOOTCAMP partition with APFS container I feel like this is a known problem on High Sierra, but I can't delete my BOOTCAMP partition to gain \"Free Space\" and I also can't expand my APFS container that contains my MACINTOSH HD.

I can't imagine that the reason is the older OS. If the OS would be the reason it would make more sense if it was the other way round because Apple already killed some options to mute the start up sound before.\nDoes somebody has an explanation for this?\n\nA: I believe the reason is the hardware. I have had machines that obey the mute setting and some that play the sound through the speaker, even though headphones are plugged in. I used to buy headphone jacks at Radio Shack to prevent the restart sound when at the office, but the hardware would override that and play the sound anyways. \n", "Q: Hard Drive I replaced still showing up in Disk Utility and as a Startup Disk I have a late 2012 Mac Mini running macOS Sierra (10.12.6).

How do I find the Apple startup chime/sounds on my computer?\nI know there has to be someway for it to be stored, but I'd just like to be able to access the file/raw binary...\n\nA: The sounds are stored in firmware, and not as a file.\nSome more info regarding startup sounds here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202768\n\nA: Not stating your hardware makes this further a bit complicated. There were quite a few Macintoshes and Macs with very different sounds and different ROMs, firmwares…\nIf you just want to access the sounds (not extract them form your machine by hand, just use them): use MacTracker for all the old StartUp Sounds.

However, I'm getting this:\n\nFollowing https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4827576?tstart=0, I've also tried to use Archive Utility; this appears to create an algs4.jar.cpgz file but I'm not sure what to do with it. How can I open the JAR file?\n\nA: Even though the error message says to check the Console I couldn't find anything useful there. However if you try to run the JAR file from the Terminal you get this error:\nno main manifest attribute, in ./algs4.jar\n\nThis error means that the JAR file is missing the \"Main-Class\" parameter in its MANIFEST.MF file. The Main-Class parameter tells the Java runtime which class is the Entry Point, i.e. which class to run first when launching.\nYou can add this parameter using the Terminal. First of all download the JAR file from the Princeton website, then run the following command (assuming the JAR file is in your Downloads folder):\njar ufe ~/Downloads/algs4.jar TestAlgs4\n\nThis command updates the MANIFEST.MF file within the JAR. Once that is done the JAR file should run from the Finder or the Terminal successfully.\n\nHaving said all that, you only get the error if you try to run the JAR like an executable. I don't think you're meant to do that. You are meant to just place the JAR file somewhere the Java runtime can find it, and then refer to it in the code you write as you do the exercises in this book. There are clear instructions here on what you are supposed to do with the JAR file here: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/\n\nA: As the error message says, you can check the Console (/Applications/Utilities/Console) for error logs. You could also open a Terminal window and run the jar from the command line, which should cause any errors to output into the terminal. If your jar is in your downloads folder you would run:\njava -jar ~/Downloads/algs4.jar\n\nOnce you have the error, if you can't figure it out, update your question and we can try to provide more information.\n", "Q: iPhone backup: extracting app vs copy?

Can't seem to get it working with all 3.\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)\nVersion 10.12.5\n\nA: It might be that you have exceeded the maximum resolution that the graphics sub-system supports. From Apple's specifications for your Mac:\n\nVideo Support\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display at millions of colors and:\nUp to two displays with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\nUp to four displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at millions of colors\nUp to four displays with 3840-by-2160 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\n\nYou'll have to keep your resolution settings below the figures listed above. My guess is that you may have one or more monitors that exceeds the specific resolution on one or more displays.\nIf, however, they do not exceed those specifications I would say that should warrant a call to Apple tech support (free support for the first (I think) 90 days) and see if they can troubleshoot the issue with you.\n", "Q: How to restart USB subsystem? I'm developing onto Arduino and sometimes the USB port that is being used stops working. Then I need to plug the device into another USB port. Once all the USB ports stop working I have to restart the machine which is really annoying.\nAs far as I remember there is a command which is able to restart the USB subsystem individually but I can't remember. How can I restart USBs without restarting the entire system?\nI'm using macOS Sierra.\nThis is different to the question Resetting the USB port on a MacBook Pro as I need software-only solution as my USB ports get frozen - which means they stop working until full system restart. There must be a way of restarting the USB subsystem individually.\n\nA: You can reset the USB Bus with the USB Prober.app.  It's not included with XCode, but you can download it separately from the Apple Developer Download page.  You will need to signup and login.\n\n\n*\n\n*search for iousbfamily\n\n*Download the latest IOUSBFamily Log Release file (at the time of this post it was IOUSBFamiliy Log Release for OS X 10.9.3)\n\n*Mount the .dmg and navigate to the directory with IOUSB-XXXXXX-log.\n\n*DO NOT install.  Just right click the package and \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*Unzip the Archive.pax.gz; the file USBProber.app will be in /Archive/DevTools/Hardware\n\nImportant:\nJust launching the app will reset your USB bus.  Make sure you you unmount any drives you don't want unceremoniously and improperly removed!\n\nA: To reset a USB device, first download the USB Prober.app as explained in this other answer.\nNext, you need to figure out the so-called Vendor and Product IDs of the USB device that you want to reset. You can do that with USB Prober, but it may be easier by using the System Profiler app from your Application / Utilities folder: Select USB within the Hardware topic in the left pane, then look for your USB device in the top right pane, select it, and you'll see its Product and Vendor IDs shown below, like this:\n\nThe IDs start are hex codes that start with 0x and have 4 more digits/letters. Make a note of them, with the Vendor ID first.\nInside USB Prober, there's a tool called reenumerate that you have to invoke from Terminal.app (find that in your Application / Utilities folder).\nMove or copy the downloaded USB Prober.app to your Utilities folder.\nOpen Terminal.app, and paste the following line into it:\n/Applications/Utilities/USB\\ Prober.app/Contents/Resources/reenumerate\n\nThen click into the Terminal window and type the space key, then type the two USB device IDs, Vendor ID first, separated with a comma. If your IDs were 0x174c and 0x55aa, then the line now should read:\n...$ /Applications/Utilities/USB\\ Prober.app/Contents/Resources/reenumerate -v 0x174c,0x55aa\n\nPress return and you should get output similar to this:\nVerbose mode ON\nLooking for vid: 0x174c, pid: 0x55aa\nFound \"ASM105x\" @ 0x14200000\nCalling USBDeviceReEnumerate\nUSBDeviceReEnumerate returns 0x00000000\n\nIf you don't get more than the first line, it means that you entered the wrong IDs. If you get the full output, the device should have reset - for a disk device this means that it'll disconnect and reconnect as if you had unplugged the cable briefly.\nIf you invoke the reenumerate command without any arguments, you'll get usage information with more options you could try.\n", "Q: Copy the original when dragging a alias I have i.e. a folder full with alias from everywhere on my system.

In the movie \"Steve Jobs\" with Michael Fassbender, it is implied that Jobs started NeXT, not to sell hardware, but to develop a new OS and have Apple buy the company, only for the OS. We all know the history and know that this is exactly what happened. \nNow I am diving a little into Apple OSs and find that the OS Apple had/developed while Jobs was away, was the \"Classic Mac OS\". In the movie it is said that Apple \"really needed\" a new OS. \nThis all made me wonder: what was so bad about the classic Mac OS?\n\nA: From the Wikipedia article on Classic Mac OS:\n\nMac OS is characterized by its monolithic system. From its original\n  release through System 4, it ran only one application at a time. Even\n  so, it was noted for its ease of use. Mac OS gained cooperative\n  multitasking with System 5, which ran on the Macintosh SE and\n  Macintosh II. It was criticized for its very limited memory\n  management, lack of protected memory, no access controls, and\n  susceptibility to conflicts among extensions that provide additional\n  functionality such as networking or support for a particular device.\n\n\nA: Did Not Multitask\nIt had limited, cooperative multi-tasking, but this was spliced on top of a fundamentally single-tasking OS.  That meant if a (say, background) task was greedy or had a problem, the whole system ran badly or locked up. \nThere was a point when Microsoft was \"eating Apple's lunch\" because multitasking worked so much better on Windows - and Apple lost a lot of market share. \nNo crash protection\nIt did not have any way to contain the failure of one particular app.   So when one app \"crashed\", the system crashed.  Being able to run multiple applications concurrently, to say nothing of the array of often dozens of desk accessories, extensions and whatnot, that created a huge vulnerability.  \nIt was common for a Mac to come into the shop with so many desk accessories installed that you had to scroll to see them all.  I said \"They did to this Mac what a pimp does to a Cadillac.\"  No wonder it was in the shop. \nNo security\nAlso related, there was no hardware-based memory protection, so one app could scribble another app's memory from a simple bug.  \nThis also meant an application, DA etc. could snoop on the contents and activities in system memory. What's the point of having password logins when your free screensaver DA can simply scan memory looking for the passwords? \nWithout an ability to keep applications contained, this also meant filesystem security was a lost cause. Among other things, there was no way to keep applications from damaging or hacking the OS.  \nViruses started on the Mac, you know.  This sort of thing is why.  They also virtually ended when OS X came out. \nNo shell\nOkay, that only matters to a few people, but there was absolutely no robust back-end from which to keyboard/script system tasks.  No way to, say, \"rsync\" a directory to a backup; you had to rely on packaged products.  Of course there were developer tools, but that was not readily available to end users, you had to sign up and if I recall, pay some fees. \nUpgrading OS 8/9 to proper multitasking was a hard problem - a veritable Gordian knot.  It needed an \"Alexander the Great\" solution, and that's where Steve came in. \n", "Q: What do the \"Other\" and \"Developer\" options in Spotlight index? In Spotlight, you can set what types of items you want to be indexed and searchable.  Most of the options are fairly straightforward: \"Contacts\" searches your contacts, \"Images\" for images, and so on.  However, there are two options that I don't understand: \"Other\" and \"Developer\".\n\nThe Search Results panel is rather fine grained.  Why is there, what I'm guessing to be, a catch all option with \"Other\" and what does it catch?  Similarly, what does the \"Developer\" option index?\nI looked in the \"Spotlight preferences\" page of the \"Mac Help\", but from what I can tell, it doesn't detail it.

For example, I searched for .h, .html and .m files and they were listed under the \"Development\" category:\n\n\"Other\" must be for anything that macOS can't make a good guess at.  For example, I searched for .json files and actual .json files showed up under \"Developer\".  However, files that had unknown or missing extensions showed up under \"Other\":\n\nI'm still not sure of the complete criteria that macOS uses to discern what files fall into what category.  Additionally, it looks like Spotlight won't even try to display a preview of files in the \"Other\" category even if they are textual.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra: ulimit maxproc only 2500? macOS Sierra introduced us to the ulimit-Justin-Bieber-restriction.

If you need more user processes, enable Server Performance Mode as described here.\n\n*\"What is this number, why exactly 1064?\" See Why is macOS limited to 1064 or 2088 processes?\n\n*\"Why am I limited in user processes anyway?\" Because the system can only run a limited number of processes at once, the system limits users to a lower number of processes so that the system itself remains able to run processes, for example one to display a warning that you have run out of of processes.\n\nDetails\nThe articles the OP linked to are DANGEROUS because they install configurations that allow a single user to crash the computer by filling up the process table, meaning they can create as many processes as the system will allow (well, probably minus 2 or so reserved for root, which was a kind of protection against this in the old days when 2 processes were enough for a system administrator to get in and fix problems). They also install those configurations in a way for which there is no automatic or easy rollback once you forget that you set them or how you set them, and they may interfere with future default increases when you upgrade to a new OS version. More importantly, they do not really achieve what they claim to achieve with regard to increasing the number of processes a user can run.\nThe default hard limit for kern.maxproc (the maximum total number of processes that can run at one time systemwide) under OS X is 1064. The limit was 566 until OS X Lion, at which point it was increased to 1064 for computers with 3 GiB or more of memory. The limit was increased again in High Sierra for computers with 12 GiB or more memory (exact formula is detailed in the description of serverperfmode here.) and increased again in Catalina (and my guess is it will be increased again in Big Sur). (See Why is macOS limited to 1064 or 2088 processes? for more details about where the specific numbers like 1064 came from.) Although you can change the number while the system is running, it does not take immediate effect; you have to set it during the boot process to take effect and at that point the kernel will not go above 1064 (or whatever limit you are already seeing).\nYou can set kern.maxprocperuid (the maximum number of processes a single user can have running at one time) to a higher number, even higher than kern.maxproc, but having it too high risks having an out-of-control process crash the entire machine by filling up the process table. That is why the default maxprocperuid is 709 which is 2/3 of 1064: to ensure a single user cannot take up all the processes.\nServer Performance Mode\nBefore High Sierra, the only way to increase kern.maxproc above 1064 is to have at least 16 GiB of memory installed and the to turn on \"Server Performance Mode\", which reconfigures the kernel to operate like a server rather than an interactive workstation. Starting with High Sierra you can increase kern.maxproc by adding more memory, but still, short of adding memory, the only way to increase it is by turning on \"Server Performance Mode\". In that mode, kern.maxproc is set to floor(system_memory/8 GiB) * 2500. You also get much higher limits on many other parameters, like max open files and max network connections. You get these higher limits automatically, without having to create or modify files like the linked articles tell you to.\nIf sysctl kern.maxproc returns kern.maxproc: 1064 (or any multiple of 532 or 1044) then you know you do not have server performance mode turned on. To turn it on, execute this command line in the terminal:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"serverperfmode=1 $(nvram boot-args 2>/dev/null | cut -f 2-)\"\n\nand reboot. That setting will persist and your computer will remain in server mode until you clear NVRAM completely or turn Server Performance Mode off by executing\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"$(nvram boot-args 2>/dev/null | sed -e $'s/boot-args\\t//;s/serverperfmode=1//')\"\n\nTurning on Server Performance Mode is safer and easier than trying to change individual kernel parameters by editing configuration files, and it has the added advantage of working where those other things will not. And unlike editing configuration files, is also automatically rolled back when you clear NVRAM, which is a standard part of restoring a misconfigured computer to a standard and sane configuration.\nYou can read more about this Fix “fork: resource temporarily unavailable” on OS X.\n", "Q: I suspect this is malware. How do I remove it? Several pop-ups have recently begun appearing on my MacBook screen.  They coincide with my attempting to update Adobe Flash Player.  I suspect I was careless.  I have never seen pop-ups constantly appearing on my Mac before.  They have no name, so I cannot easily search for where the program is residing and get rid of it. Does anyone recognize these who would be able to instruct me on how to locate and eradicate?\n\n\n\nA: Turn off the Mac, then power it up holding down the shift key. depending on what has infected you that may either disable it or reduce its effect on the system.\nDownload Malwarebytes (or another) virus scanning app for the mac and run it. Hopefully it will be found and removed. If not perhaps someone here recognizes it and knows how to remove it manually.\nAlternatively if you have another Mac and the right cables to connect them together you could boot the affected Mac into target disk mode, and plug it into your other Mac that you have installed AV software on and scan the infected drive from there.\nNote that these are preliminary steps. other people may have more and/or better suggestions.

The flow is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot (Grey screen with Apple logo)\n\n*Display user accounts\n\n*Sign in to user's account\n\n*Sign in progress bar\n\n*Crash at ~1/3 complete progress bar\n\n*Reboots automatically\n\n\nBackground:\nOver the past 1.5 months the battery has become seemingly defunct.\n\n\n*\n\n*Initially, it would crash after ~2 minutes of use after waking from sleep and running off battery. It would need to be connected to power in order to start up successfully.\n\n*After about 2 months of this, it began crashing while running off battery regardless of whether or not it had woken from sleep.\n\n*Now it (usually) crashes within seconds if the charger is disconnected.\n\n\nWhen I went to the Genius Bar I was told it may be a bad battery. It passed all of their diagnostics, however, it seemed to heuristically lose charge quickly and the capacity came in at over 100% -- which is only expected from batteries right out of the factory.\nThis all seemed like a case of a bad battery until yesterday. Maybe these issues are not connected... but seems like they could be.\nTroubleshooting:\nSo far I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried 4 separate properly 85W MagSafe chargers. Same results.\n\n\n*\n\n*So it's not the bad battery.\n\n\n*Booted from an external bootable drive (running El Capitan). Same results.\n\n\n*\n\n*So, not an issue with the SSD nor corrupt OS (I think. Booting from an external drive should bypass the internal drive completely. Yes?*)\n\n\n*Ran the extended hardware test. No issues found.\n\n\n*\n\n*So, not an issue with RAM. I am going to try and run memtest if I can get access to a shell.\n\n\n*Left it idle for ~15 minutes at the login screen. Does not crash.\n\n*Spent ~15 minutes in the guest account (the safe account -- only Safari access) and messed around. Does not crash.\n\n*Spent ~2 hours of time in the \"BIOS\" pages. Hardware test, Disk Utility, etc. Does not crash.\n\n*Booting into safe mode (Cmd + S) displays BuildError(): error building a user of type\nHypothesis:\nIt seems the issue is occurring when the boot program is loading the OS. I don't know a ton about how things work at this level, but my guess is the logic board is the culprit and is failing during this handoff.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any ideas?\n\n*Could a bad battery somehow bust up power management -- or is it entirely isolated whilst connected to external power?\n\n*Have I done enough to rule out corrupt software, SSD, and RAM?\n\n\nA: This question is an excellent example of the unintended consequences of not addressing a small issue (bad battery) and having it create new issues (crashing).\nWhile it may appear that a bad battery and a crashing hard drive are mutually exclusive, they, in fact, are intrinsically linked.  This however, doesn't preclude the possibility that their are other issues at play, but in order to address efficiently and accurately, you have to eliminate the initial problem.\nThe Battery\nYou have a at least an 18 month old battery assuming it was \"brand new\" when you installed it and not sitting around in a warehouse for a few years prior to your purchase.\nYour battery reports its remaining capacity based on a calculation of certain variables - the current voltage and the draw.  It can't measure the batteries ability to hold a charge.  So reading a battery that says 100% only means it's 100% at that moment.\nSleeping on a Dead Battery\nWhen your MacBook Pro detects a low battery condition, it will put the MacBook Pro to sleep.  Going to sleep powers everything down except the RAM;  its current state is kept in RAM so you can quickly resume right where you left off.  If your power gets low enough, it will go into hibernation mode writing the RAM to disk.\nIf your battery dissipates so quickly as to not allow this state to be saved, you run the risk of corrupting data (and not just your pictures of cats and toasters, but data critical to macOS).  This sounds like the issue you described.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n*\n\n*Eliminate your battery from the equation.  Disconnect it from the logic board.  Remove the back cover and using a plastic tool (like a spudger) remove the battery connection. Your MacBook doesn't need a battery to function.  You don't need to replace the back cover for the next step, just be certain you are not putting the MBP on a conductive material.  You can put it on a towel if you want.\n\n\n*Check the health of your SSD.  Boot into recovery mode, and run the following commands to check the SMART status of your SSD:\n$ diskutil verifyDisk disk0\n$ diskutil info disk0 | grep -i smart\n\nMost likely, you will get \"Verified\" with the last command meaning your SSD is good.  Anything other than \"verified\" consider getting a new disk.\nIf everything is good, you can move on to fixing the login issue\n\nFix Login Issue\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user in Terminal.  Boot into Single User Mode and then issue the following commands\nfsck -y\nmount -uw /\n\nWhat you are doing is checking the drive and then mounting the / volume as read/write.  To create a new user, follow the instructions already written up in this post being sure to adjust the values for your specific needs.  Reboot by typing reboot\nIf you can log in with this newly created account, you corrupted your User Profile and your best bet is to use this new account and/or create another one.\nIf it solves your issue, you can skip to step 3.  If you can't log in, continue to the next step.\n\n*Reinstall macOS.  Operating under the assumption you have made Time Machine backups, reinstall the OS.  Migrate your backed up data using Migration Assistant.  \n\n*Run your Mac, but don't disconnect the power. (you're not on battery, remember?) Use your Mac as you normally would.  If you have no problems, then the issue of it crashing is solved.  \n\n*Replace the battery.  If everything works, you would have resolved the login crash issue and narrowed down the cause to the failing battery. See this Answer:\n\nWhen they [batteries] do die, it's always best to get a good quality replacement\n  battery from a reputable manufacturer. The 2006 MBP uses an external\n  battery so it's fairly easy to find replacements - and some even come\n  with generous warranties.\n\nEven though it's written to address a 2006 MBP, the explanation and recommendations are still valid and relevant.\n", "Q: Help getting conditional statement at the end of this script, to function correctly Basically the function of this script is to convert a video file to Apple TV compatible format and then delete the original files after the conversion is complete.\nI'm absolutely at my “whits end”.

If the downloaded video file is not contained by a folder of its own and is now contained by the “Finished” folder…  then just delete that one video file only. <<— this part does not work correctly.

I made an iPhone backup on someone else windows computer and now need to send it to my Mac to restore my iPhone because it got bricked. If I simply send the file over a torrent and put it in the backup folder on my Mac's iTunes, will I have any trouble with restoring my device? I'm worried the format that iTunes on windows uses is different then on Macs'. \nfollow up question: Is there a better way then a torrent to send a file about 50gb?\n\nA: The backup format is the same for Mac and Windows, so you can copy your backup from the C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup folder on your Windows computer to ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup on your Mac yes. If you need instructions for various versions of Mac and Windows to access these folders, here's a blog post I wrote with them.\nIf you have a USB thumb drive, that may be better to copy the 50GB backup. :) You could also right-click on the folder for the backup and select Send To > Compressed Folder first to zip it.\n\nA: BitTorrent is actually quite well suited to transferring very large files or groups of files. It can be a good choice, especially if the user is already familiar with it.\nThe BitTorrent protocol:\n\n*\n\n*is (relatively?) efficient\n\n*tolerates errors well and can recover from interrupted transfers\n\n*doesn’t have some of the inefficiencies / overhead of the SMB3 protocol used by modern file sharing on macOS and Windows, especially if you’re transferring a folder containing many (i.e. hundreds or thousands) of separate files.\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*Just transfer over the actual ‘.torrent’ file,\na. or use a magnet link in clients with ‘local peer discovery enabled.\n\n*For private files, just don’t publish the ‘.torrent’ file to any trackers.\n\nIf you aren’t familiar with BitTorrent, Resilio Sync uses the same technology but without the ‘scary’ BitTorrent name. It works much like Dropbox _(but without any data stored in ‘the cloud’) and is just as easy to set up.

To create Mac application I used Platypus. To run my application shell script was used. \nHowever at this case when application starts then separate java process starts and there neither proper name of the app nor proper About description in Mac menu. Also Terminal starts that is not wanted.\nHow I should launch the app to avoid this drawbacks so that the name of the app and About description were the right ones?\nWhat I see now (name and About):\n\n\nMy launching shell script is the following:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport IRULE_HOME=\"$(cd \"$(dirname \"$0\")\" && pwd -P)\"\n\nexport IRULE_LANG=en\nexport IRULE_REGION=EN\nexport IRULE_XMS=-Xms256m\nexport IRULE_XMX=-Xmx1024m\nexport LOG4J_CONFIGURATION=${IRULE_HOME}/conf/log4j2.xml\nexport JAVA_HOME=\"${IRULE_HOME}/jre/Contents/Home\"\n\nexport DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS=\"$IRULE_XMS \\\n              $IRULE_XMX \\\n              -Dlog4j.configuration=file:\"${LOG4J_CONFIGURATION}\" \\\n              -Dirule.home=${IRULE_HOME} \\\n              -Dirule.client.logs.path=${IRULE_HOME}/logs \\\n              -Duser.language=\"${IRULE_LANG}\" \\\n              -Duser.region=\"${IRULE_REGION}\" \\\n              $JAVA_OPTS\"\n\n\nexport PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${JAVA_HOME}:${PATH}\nexport CLASSPATH=${IRULE_HOME}/lib/*:${IRULE_HOME}/conf:${JAVA_HOME}/lib/jfxrt.jar;\n\nexec ${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java -Xdock:name=\"iRule Reader\" -Xdock:icon=${IRULE_HOME}/image/irule.png ${DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS} -classpath \"${CLASSPATH}\" com.spi2.Main $* \n\nHow I created the app by Platypus. The process is simple: I set my shell-script and add all my resources. Also I can set up the icon. And I add Credits.html to allow About description as said in documentation:\n\n\nA: If you use a shell script you must run it from a shell and so to ghet a shell macOS opens Terminal. You are also not running an app so not getting the correct setup for icons, menus etc.\nTo be seen as an app the executable needs to be packaged as per Apple's Bundle documentation\nThis Platypus seems to say it should do this. So in this case you need to read its documentation and see what you have not done. If this is the problem then this would need to be a question on StackOverflow but you would need to show how you set your app up.\n", "Q: What's the difference between \"Initialize\" and \"Erase\"? I was recently handed an old backup hard drive that my co-workers couldn't read because it used one of the EXT file systems. They didn't tell me what they wanted at first, so I assumed I should try to get the data off of it.\nI plugged it in, and my a dialog asked me to initialize, eject, or ignore.\n\nI ignored it, because I knew I would need to install osxfuse and ext4fuse, which I did, and I was able to read the disk just fine. Only after that, my coworker told me that he wanted the disk erased and formatted with a filesystem that he could use on his PC. But even though I had the disk mounted and readable, my attempts to format it failed. I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Utility > Erase > ExFAT, which gave a simple \"operation failed\" error,\n\n*diskutil eraseVolume ExFAT NewName disk2, which gave a \"cannot unmount disk\" error,\n\n*umount, which gave a \"disk isn't mounted\" error, and\n\n*all of the above after unplugging the drive various ways.\n\n\nFinally, I rebooted, and when I plugged in the drive again, I was asked to initialize, eject, or ignore. I choose to initialize this time, and suddenly I could erase to various formats with no issues. \nThis behavior surprised me because I assumed \"initialize*, erase, and format were all synonyms. I guess they're not. So what's the difference? How can one force the initialize dialog to appear?\n\nA: Looking up the definitions, we find:\n\nInitialize:  On Apple Macintosh computers, initializing a disk means formatting it.\n\nAs erase is more a more generic term; from Merriam-Webster we get:\n\nErase: \n  to remove (recorded matter) from a magnetic medium; also :  to remove\n  recorded matter from erase a videotape; to delete from a computer\n  storage device erase a file\n\nWhen you initialize a device, you make it usable by the operating system.   When you erase a device/file, you remove the contents.  Initializing a device previously used with an incompatible format will inherently, erase the device.\nTo put it another way, you can erase without initializing, but you cannot initialize without erasing.  \ndiskutil's eraseDisk command requires you to specify the format so in effect you are always initializing the disk.\nHowever, there is also the reformat command that, that allows you to erase an existing volume with same name and type. \n", "Q: Can I move Xcode and Android Studio to SD card I'm planning to buy a 64GB SD card to supplement the storage on my MacBook Air 128GB (early 2015)\nI wanted to know if I can move my Xcode and android studio to it as both have them take a significant part of the memory.\nIf this can happen, I wanted to know how can I move these two to the SD card. I'm fairly new to macOS and have no idea how to do this.\n\nA: Can you? Yes.\nIs it wise? Perhaps not.\nFlash storage is notoriously frail. Once it fails, that's, it, it's gone, usually taking everything on there with it.\nThe adage \"Any data not stored in at least three distinct locations ought to be considered temporary\" is not one to take lightly.\nOther than that - it will run like molasses from an SD card.\nFlash on USB sticks/SD cards is not the same as on an SSD drive - this has a better explanation than I could possibly compete with -\nSuperUser - What's the technical difference between a flash drive and an SSD?\nIn the end, it’s your choice what you store externally, so if other things are more vital than code, keep them on the internal storage. If code is the priority, move photos or music or video files to SD storage. \n\nA: Yes, you can move these apps to SDCard by directly dragging these from your Applications directory to destination on your SD card.\nApplications can generally run from anywhere. Some support files get stored in your home folder regardless of the location of the document or app. \n", "Q: Are there any good Apple Watch apps to track roller skating?

There are a lot of different kind of exercises to track, including roller skating ;\n", "Q: Can playing music at full volume on a 15\" MBP (2017) damage the speaker irreversibly? A few weeks ago, the left speaker on my MacBook suddenly \"popped\" when I received a notification. The volume was not high and no music was playing. It seems that the speaker was overdriven and pretty much self-destructed. It sounded like a very loud bang and the speaker never worked correctly again afterwards. The moment it happened, I noticed a fair amount of heat coming out of the part of my MacBook's chassis where the speaker is hosted.\nAs this failure was not my fault (I was not playing any sounds at a volume you'd consider reckless), it was replaced by Apple under Warranty.\nSince I now have a fully functional MacBook again, I'd like to enjoy its speakers but I'm very wary of the fact that they're vulnerable.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are the 2017 15\" MacBook Pro's speakers designed to withstand playing music (primarily Electronic Dance Music in my case) at the maximum volume with negligible wear to the speaker?\n\n*Given that I generally play music no louder than at 50% volume, will this reduce the risk of damage to the speaker to a negligible level such that long-term use is unlikely to affect the speaker?\n\n\nA: Yes, high volume on an underpowered amp, can damage your speakers.\nThe problem comes in when the audio starts to clip or distort - the loud \"pop\" you heard is a good example of what can damage a speaker.\nThere's lots of discussion about this on AV forums.\n\nAre the 2017 15\" MacBook Pro's speakers designed to withstand playing\n  music (primarily Electronic Dance Music in my case) at the maximum\n  volume with negligible wear to the speaker?\n\nThat depends.  At what input level was the music recorded?  If you must crank up the volume because you can't hear it (assuming your hearing is good), then it was recorded to low.  If you simply need more volume on a consistent basis requiring you to be at max, it's time for an external amplifier and speaker setup.\n\nGiven that I generally play music no louder than at 50% volume, will\n  this reduce the risk of damage to the speaker to a negligible level\n  such that long-term use is unlikely to affect the speaker?\n\nThat depends.  At what input level was the music recorded?  If the input was very high, playing at 50% might still be \"too loud\" for the speakers.  The key here is clipping and distortion.  If the sound begins to distort but you need the volume at that level, it's time to get an external amplifier and speaker setup.\nI personally had noise (pops and distortion) on my speakers and I solved it by using an external DAC (digital audio converter) and external speakers (Bose Wave Radio).  \nFinally, the one thing that I learned (from an audio engineer) from trying to set up an audio presentation in a gymnasium (worst case scenario) is it's better to have more \"larger\" amplified speakers at lower volume than to have fewer speakers driven at or near maximum volume.  The quality of the sound is just immensely better and you don't risk damaging your equipment\n\nA: No. They rigorously test these scenarios before they role out. \n", "Q: Copy SMS and imessages from one phone to other WITHOUT restoring backup I have a friend who needs to get SMS messages and imessages from an old phone to a new phone.\nI understand that restoring the new phone using a backup of the old phone will acheive this.  But this can't work in his situation because the backup is tied to the find my iphone on his ex wife's account.   If he restores that backup his phone constantly asks for the password of his wife's icloud account.  He cannot get that information.\nHe has tried third party software with no success.\nIs there a way to get the messages off one phone onto another without doing the restore backup.\nOR, is there a way to prevent the backup tied to the wife's find-my-iphone from being bricked by requiring the wife's icloud password.\n\nA: I work on a tool called Decipher Phone Refresh (https://deciphertools.com/decipher-phone-refresh.html) running this over the backup and selecting to keep only the Messages app data (definitely not accounts) should accomplish a clean backup with the Messages data that won't require the old iCloud account during setup. So uncheck all of the options, and only check the Messages app data.\nDon't select apps, since those will be tied to the old App Store account (which I assume is the same as the iCloud account) and will ask for the password to install the apps.\n", "Q: is there a notification on find my macbook? when you use find my iphone to locate a macbook does it notify the macbook that you are online?  If I sign into Find My Iphone on my phone and my macbook is in use by someone else, will they see that I have signed in? \n\nA: Tested empirically...\nNo, not until I \"Played a sound\", which played & put up a dialog on the Mac, then I was sent an email, within 2 seconds, which of course arrived on both my iPhone & Mac simultaneously, telling me I'd 'Played a sound'.\nSo, you can check the location without any notification, provided that's all you do.\n", "Q: Is there a way to flip the touchbar icons? Straightforward question: Is there a way to flip the buttons so the minimized control strip appears on the left and opens to the right, and so the escape button is stuck to the right of the bar? I constantly find myself accidentally hitting the buttons on the right since they are so close to the delete button. \nEssentially, I'd like to mirror the two segments (control strip and esc button) of the touch bar shown below:\n\n\nA: I don't know if I understand your question current - BUT if I do, then here it goes.\nIf you open System Preferences=>Keyboard\n\nThen you'll have a \"Customize Control Strip...\" button - which then allow you to build your own button order in the strip bar.\n\n", "Q: Mail app: switch-off auto-synchronisation of some accounts I have multiple email accounts that I have configured in the mail app. Is is possible to turn the synchronisation off selectively for one or two accounts? \n\nA: Ok... after looking over and over again, there is a solution.

There are hundreds of duplicates. I can get rid of the 1 at a time but I've already deleted several hundred. \nIs there any way to delete them all at once? \nOr find a way to stop duplicating them.\n\nA: If you have a Mac, and you are using iCloud, I would recommend that you use the bookmark manager in macOS Safari to delete these. You should be able to select a vast amount of bookmarks using a shift + click.\n", "Q: Early 2011 MacBook Pro does not standby correctly My Early 2011 15\" MBP non-retina will not enter standby mode correctly.

As a contingency plan in the event I would forget my web interface password, to then save my bacon, I want to be able to connect it to console in spite of the fact I do not do Linux and equivalent. The advice I found on the device website seems rather complex:\n\nInstall an appropriate CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP driver on my Mac;\nUse a Terminal program (screen, or ZTerm, or cu, but not Terminal);\nUse Terminal to locate the port and connect to it.\n\nThis could be old advice, prior to mac OS 10.12.

Can I avoid using Terminal?\n\nA: I don't know if I am a \"serious Mac user\" but I do use my Mac \"seriously\".\nThe instructions you got fit pretty much all OSes (Windows, macOS, Linux).  It just depends on the software that you use\nWhat those instructions are telling you is to use an RS-232 connection to talk to the router.  This type of maintenance has been around since at least the 1970s and predates macOS/OS X\nThe only \"modern\" difference is that they now recommend a USB to UART bridge, or in more common vernacular, a USB to Serial Adapter because modern computers haven't been shipping with RS-232 serial ports for a long, long time now (since USB became mainstream).\nYou won't need to install any software; you just need to use screen that is included with macOS.  You must go through Terminal because\n\n\n*\n\n*screen only runs in Terminal\n\n*you are connecting to the pfSense console (which is, in effect, another Terminal connected to a serial port)\n\n\nWhat you would then do is connect to the console by issuing the command:\n$ screen /dev/cu<USBdeviceName>\n\nI currently don't have one attached to my Mac so I can't show you an exact name.  Though, I do  have FreeBSD on an old Dell workstation for this with dedicated RS-232 ports and my devices are /dev/cuca0 and /dev/cuca2.

Does Wireless Diagnostics offer any Apple events?\n\nA: Following this answer, I'd suggest starting by symlinking the airport tool, which is the backend behind the Wireless Diagnostic tool:\nsudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport\n\nand using it to sniff e.g. on channel 1 on your connection en1 (see ifconfig to figure out which network interface is the wireless one) via:\nsudo airport en1 sniff 1\n\nwhich will create a uniquely named .cap file in /tmp/. Use ctrl+c to end the sniffing. (Note that /tmp/ will be cleaned on reboot!)\nNote that you can also use tcpdump directly for sniffing, without disassociating from wireless networks by:\nsudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -nei en1 -s 0 -w /tmp/scan.pcap\n\n", "Q: Filter out ARP query from given ether:ip Let's say on my network there is a hacker who floods my computer with arp messages to associate his MAC address with the IP of the computer I want to reach.\nIt's like he sends the following message continuously (100 packets per second) to my computer:\n192.168.1.2 (my target) has 0:0:0:0:0:1 (hacker's MAC address)\n\nthe following does not work, I end up with the two association in arp -a:\narp -a -d; arp -s 192.168.1.2 0:0:0:0:0:2 (the real MAC address of the target)\n\nIs it possible on macOS to  drop the arp packets from the hacker?\n\nA: You could use a static ARP entry to solve the problem. This is done using \"arp -s\" as you write in your question. The second association is not a problem as the static entry will take precedence.\nAlternatively you could block the MAC address of the spoofer. For example you could use the \"ifconfig bridge\" command to create a bridge over which you tunnel all packets from the evil MAC-address. When configuring the bridge, set that it tags the packets.\nThen you can use the pf packet filter to examine all the tagged packets and possible reject them.\n", "Q: Converting Word Table to iPhone I have a my contact list on my PC, formatted as a table in Word (.doc). Is there a convenient way to transfer this info into my iPhone 7+ contact list other than manual data entry?\n\nA: One solution is to import the contacts stored in the Word table into the macOS Contacts Application. These are the steps to get your Word table over to Contacts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the whole word table into the clipboard (cmd-C)\n\n*Paste what you’ve copied into a new excel spreadsheet (cmd-V)\n\n*Save the Excel sheet into a CSV file (comma-separated values\n\n*Open the macOS Contacts application and select File > Import (cmd-O)\n\n*A dialog appears in which you can specify how the import file components will be assigned to the Contacts fields.

The Mac and PC is connected to the same switch but the PC gets IP 192.168.2.X, which is correct. I've tried specifying the router on the Mac as 192.168.2.1 but it still gets a 192.168.0.X address. \nI'm out of ideas and would love any hints at what might be going on (and how to correct it).\n\nA: The switch is not responsible for handing out IP-adresses, so the fact that they're connected to the same switch does not matter.\nIt is the DHCP server that hands out IP-adresses. The DHCP server on home networks is usually inside a cabled or WiFi router, but you can also find DHCP servers in other network devices and as a software feature on PCs.\nIn your case it sounds like you could have two DHCP servers connected to the same network. That is not a good idea if they're not configured to interact, as this will cause configuration issues such as the ones, you're experiencing.\nHunt down the extraneous DHCP server and turn if off to make sure your devices get the right IP-adresses.\n\nA: I had this happen at work after upgrading a iMac to Mojave.

Why not allow or require it in both cases? Why require the power cable in the case, in which the battery will last longer?\n\nA: The why only Apple can answer. There's no technical reason why it cannot be done.\nHowever, I would guess that the reason is that if you have an open MacBook Pro, you know that you're using it and draining energy.\nIf you have a closed MacBook Pro, the average home user might think that the laptop is \"turned off\" and not consuming energy. I.e. you could create a situation where the user runs low on battery even though they thought the system was passive.\n\nA: \nWhy? Why not allow or require it in both cases?\n\nThe default behavior when you close the lid on your MacBook is to put it to sleep.  According to Apple:\nTo further expand on this point, let's look at the default behavior when the lid is open(ed) - the MacBook is awake.  This makes sense as this is the generally accepted method of using a notebook.  The external display, and USB ports are also, by the inherent nature of the computer being awake, functional.\n\nYou can save energy by putting your Mac to sleep when you're not using\nit. When your Mac is sleeping, it's on but consumes less power. And\nwaking your Mac from sleep is quicker than starting it up after it's\nbeen shut down. To put your Mac to sleep immediately, do one of the\nfollowing:\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple () menu > Sleep.\n\n*If you use a Mac notebook computer, close its built-in display.\n\n*Press Command (⌘)–Media Eject(⏏).\n\n*Tap the power button on your computer.\n\n\n(Emphasis mine)\nHaving the AC adapter connected is just one of the components needed to override the default behavior; you need to have the AC power, keyboard and mouse connected, as well as a monitor. See Use your Mac notebook computer in closed-display mode with an external display for more details.\nWhy did Apple do it this way?  Ultimately, only they can give you the official answer, but a little deduction tells us that if closing the lid puts the machine to sleep, how would it know to stay awake if the user wanted to operate in closed-clamshell mode?  Answer:  attach a monitor and the AC adapter.\nCan you override the default behavior\nYes.  Using pmset\nTo disable wake/sleep on lid state:\nsudo pmset -a lidwake 0\n\nTo undo the last setting\nsudo pmset -a lidwake 1\n\nThough you can do this, I don't recommend it, because disabling this feature means when you close the lid on your laptop it remains awake; even when you pack it in your laptop bag and put it in the overhead compartment.  It (the battery) will most likely be DOA, plus it tends to get quite hot in that scenario, shortening the life of the battery.\n", "Q: Homebrew install package which then won't run I've installed homebrew and used it successfully for installing and using packages before.

I have an external Seagate solid state hard drive that was working and out of the blue stopped working. The only thing on it was my Adobe Lightroom images/videos. Not the LR DB files. I'm sure you have all heard this woe before, so I won't dwell on that. And yes, I back up to the cloud. AWS S3 specifically. Though I am traveling South East Asia for the last year, and staying in cheap hostels. So good internet is hard to come by sometimes. I can't back it up after every export. While most of it is backed up, there is some that is not.\nMoving on. The symptoms seems to change every time I plug it in. The first sign was it ejected on it's own. I plugged it in again, and it wouldn't mount. Disk Utility recognized it, so did the command line diskutil list but it wouldn't mount. I rebooted and it worked for a second. Then I could only get to it from the command line. Then trying to frantically back up to my local what was not backed up to the cloud, it all failed. Basically just a cp -R [directory] [local-directory] command.\nAfter some more frantic unplugging and re-plugging plus some command line manual mounts, I finally got it to where the Disk Utility would be able to run first aid on it. It failed. I don't recall the error. So I put it in a freezer. After a few hours I tried again. It is not any better. It still will not mount. Now Disk Utility sees it, but with no partition. I can't even give me information about how much space is used on it.\nI have also tried it from a Windows machine. It did not mount. I have tried other cables. No success. As well as tried my other USB port. I also have another working external hard drive exactly like the one giving me issues. It works on all cables and USB ports.\nI do have Docker running with a Ubuntu container, I'm trying to think of a way to see if I can try to get to the USB from there. I also have a USB that I have thought about running a live Ubuntu on there to see if I can mount and retrieve the data or fix the HDD that way. But if it will not mount, I doubt these will work.\nCan anyone else think of any other tricks I can try myself to see if I can repair this or at least retrieve the data without paying for a service or software? If not, those suggestions are also welcome.\nUpdate\n\n\n*\n\n*I made the mistake in original post that it was a Solid State Drive. This is my mistake, it is actually a spinning disk hard drive. I bought them long ago and have been traveling with them for so long I just forgot. Question is updated to reflect this.\n\n*Now diskutil list does not show it at all. The Disk Utility app also does not see it.\n\n*Based on suggestion from @Allen I seeked out the USB to SATA cable. I did not quite find it, as my options are extremely limited where I am at. Though a local expat on a facebook group was able to help me with a empty 2.5 casing that I was able to extract the drive from original casing and put it in his blank case. It now mounts. Though it has the \"click of death\" sound to it. And data is not really reachable. While I can ls the directories and Adobe Lightroom does not have the exclamation mark when it can not reach the actual external files. Right clicking on the images and clicking on \"Show in Finder\" or any other variation of trying to get to the files through Finder or terminal, I have no success. It usually hangs and I get the spinning wheel. Since Adobe Lightroom imports these images into directories named by date, I am going to send the drive off to a data recovery service and ask to recover just unbacked up directories i.e. dates. Next time I will make harder efforts to backup and probably get an actual SSD.\n\n\nI think this can be closed, due to my low reputation points I can not close this myself.\n\nA: \n...any other tricks I can try myself to see if I can repair this or at\n  least retrieve the data without paying for a service or software?\n\nBased on everything you said, there are only two conditions that exist:\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB enclosure has failed.  This is the least bad scenario.  The \"enclosure\" has a USB to SATA controller that is the interface of the drive.  It's not out of the realm of possibility that it \"reports\" back the drive, but refuses to mount/read/write/etc.  \n\n*The SSD drive itself has failed This is the worst case scenario.  If the drive has failed, there's nothing you're going to do to force it to start working.  \nHow can you find out which scenario is the one you're dealing with?  I wrote an answer to a similar question that addresses this situation exactly. It involves a cheap USB to SATA adapter to remove the enclosure from the equation.  If the drive works, it was the enclosure;  you get the added benefit of the adapter being a temp solution until you get the enclosure fixed (or another external drive).  If it doesn't work, then you know the SSD has died.  \n", "Q: Other than user error, what types of attacks would SIP prevent? On this site and throughout other Apple enthusiast communities, I often see people strongly advise against disabling System Integrity Protection. This has always struck me as somewhat odd, as SIP did not even exist until recently, and it prevents a lot of tweaks that used to be relatively commonplace, such as SIMBL and OSXFuse.\nIf I am an enthusiast user following basic security practices such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a strong, unique administrative password.\n\n*Only granting administrator permissions to applications I trust.\n\n*Only using sudo when necessary, and only for commands I understand.\n\n\nWhat types of attacks am I opening myself up to by leaving SIP disabled?\nPut another way, is a Mac computer without SIP more vulnerable than a comparable machine running a default configuration of Windows or a common flavor of Linux?\n\nA: From Apple's page About System Integrity Protection on your Mac\n\nBefore System Integrity Protection, the root user had no permission\n  restrictions, so it could access any system folder or app on your Mac.\n  Software obtained root-level access when you entered your\n  administrator name and password to install the software. That allowed\n  the software to modify or overwrite any system file or app.\n\nSo, based on the premise of your question, a good sys admin would have used strong passwords, admin permissions to only users/apps that you trust and only using sudo when necessary.\nOk...let's look at a hypothetical, but entirely plausible scenario:  Installing VirtualBox.\nAssume for a moment, that the VirtalBox site got hacked and a malicious version of VB was uploaded and made available as genuine.  Since to install VB it requires root privileges, you would invariably use sudo to install it (this is why it asks you for your password).\nWithout SIP, it could write to any of the protected areas as root installing itself with full admin privileges to do whatever nefarious things it wanted to do.  It's important to note that the security practices you enumerated in your question never came into play.\nIt's just another layer of protection.\nA Mac with SIP is no more or less safe than a Windows 10 machine with System Protection enabled.  \"Linux\" is too broad a topic to make a statement.  However, there is Oracle \"Hardened\" Linux (version of RedHat Enterprise) that has these features.\n", "Q: Apple script Call the following handler when.... assign applescript situations I Received Messages Text invitation. script .Is it showing me how to do something?

Let's assume if SIP is disabled and permissions get either maliciously or intentionally, but misguidedly changed.  How to restore these permissions to their factory settings?\nWhat is the Current Best Practice to Remedy Such a Situation, Once it has Occured?\nIt doesn't really matter exactly how a Sierra installation might end up with  less than ideal, 'broken' or 'breaking', or simply altered permissions on its system files or directories.\nThe question from the title is in slightly longer form:\nHow do you reset the file system permissions in Sierra that are relevant to the systems operation to their default settings?\n\nA: This is really quite easy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a back up (Just in case, etc..)\n\n*Download and install Mac OS on to the volume using a recovery HD / Internet Recovery or booted from a known good OS external (hold option key when booting)\n\n*Clean up user account permissions once the system is fixed.\n\n\nSince all installs are archive and install, the operation to install Sierra drops a proper, SIP protected, proper permissions system and then calls Apple's migration scripts which should migrate all apps and configurations from the old system with proper permissions in place.\nThen you can add a new admin user and remove each old user one by one - leaving their home folders alone. When you rename the old user home as a new short name - when you add those users in - that will fix the permissions on a per user basis.\n", "Q: QuickTime Player: How to Reduce Playback Speed?

This worked, creating the zip file, and when clicking on it I get a pop up with an \"Archive Utility\" window: \"Please enter password for \".DS_Store\".  Password:  [______] [<--text box].  \nI found the file was too large to email - like 42 mb, so I carved it down removing unnecessary content, but it was still closer to 40 mb.  So I uploaded to dropbox.com, then found they only allowed viewing of folder not transfer, which is a problem because it means it will be unzipped in the cloud which is not what I want.  (I want truly secure files to be viewed only by receiving party to whom I give password.)  \nI uploaded the file to google drive and did a last minute check that is was password protected and found to my amazement it unzipped without requiring a password - every file and folder visible there!  In shock I went back and checked my file on my mac and confirmed that I wasn't crazy and that it was still password protected there. (If this makes you nervous, perhaps you can check if google drive opens your mac-command-line-encrypted zip files too).   \nI'm using mavericks OS X (v. 10.9.5) on my macbook air (fall 2012). The machine is too old to update to the newest OSX Sierra per apple support, but could update Yosemite or El Capitan, but not desirable or possible since I have little working hard drive space left in my machine - hovering around 7 GB - so I don't have space for it. Otherwise I've installed all updates to mavericks.\nI decided to test if I could test if the encrypted file would remain encrypted in a PC environment which is where it would likely end up, and found again to my amazement that it was at least still encrypted (thats good) but that it couldn't be unzipped:\nCompressed (zipped) Folders Error \nWindows cannot open the folder.\nThe Compressed (zipped) Folder 'F:\\taxes2017.zip' is invalid                                        \n[OK]\n\nNote that no option to enter a password is offered, just a flat out failure.\nThis means even if I put the unix/ osx encrypted zip file on a flash drive my accountant can't open it as his end, at least if he's using my son's same PC operating system, which is Microsoft Windows 10 Home version 10.0.14393 Build 14393 on an HP Pavilion Notebook, an x64-paced PC.\nI'm wondering: \n\n\n*\n\n*Are mac command-line-encrypted files easily viewed without passwords by file transfer services besides google drive, and if there's a more advanced or secure way to encrypt, zip and transfer files over the internet to individual desktop end users.\n\n*How come encryption wasn't unencryptable in a PC environment, and how do others do physical transfer by flash drive of encrypted files between environments?\n\n*Can I transfer a truly secure file via file sharing site like google drive, where no one in the chain can open the file except the recipient I give the password to by phone or other means?  \n\n*Is there another zip and/or password protection method - or one of each - whether apple-based or third party - that is not undone by third parties and be unzipped in a windows environment with its password? I haven't tried the disk image method in disk utilities yet - maybe you can spare another hour or two of effort if it will not work in your experience.\n\nA: The encyrption was still valid, you just saw the file names within the archive. \nSometimes, though I do not know if this is the reason in your case, the hidden files within Mac folders will confuse Windows OS. The fact that it even mentions \".DS Store\" suggests that these files are part of the package you made, and my not be compatible with Windows, which does not know what to do with .DS Store folders and other Mac metadata. \nAs for zip products, you could try the free trial of WinZip, which also supports Mac. The file will be compatible with WinZip on the windows side for sure. (I am not affiliated with WinZip).\n\nA: Google Drive was able to read the manifest for that encrypted zip file, but the content of the files within the zip file should remain encrypted to Google Drive.\n\nA: I realize your question was asked quite a while ago, but for the sake of future readers, I wanted to clarify a few things. First, as was pointed out, Google Drive didn’t crack your encrypted Zip file. A little-known aspect of Zip files is that the table of contents of a Zip file is not encrypted. So, anyone can see the files contained in a zip and their unzipped sizes as well as other basic data. That’s probably not an issue since you are protecting the data not the file names.\nIn your command line example, you use the backslash to escape (disable) the interpretation of special characters. You might find it easier to just double-quote the file names instead, such as:\n“My dog’s Christmas photo.jpg”\nAlso, you can drag-and-drop files from a Finder window into Terminal and the names of the files will be pasted for you. My workflow is to type everything up to and including the double-quote before the command-line and drag-and-drop a file or directory if that’s easier than typing it manually, then type the closing double-quote.\n", "Q: rEFInd not showing macOS partition, just Ubuntu A week ago I installed Ubuntu gnome in dual boot on my MacBook Pro mid 2012 (macOS Sierra).

You can edit your sidebar by going to preferences for the finder. Single click on the desktop so Finder shows in the menu bar. Under Finder is preferences. Opening that and going to tab for sidebar allows you to set what is shown in the sidebar.

I'm following this official Apple guide, but my screen shows this:\n\nIn Apple's official guide, no disks are listed at the left of the Disk Utility interface. How can I get rid of this disk1 object? Or is this something I need not worry about? Why is this appearing?\n\nA: That is the recovery image that you reinstall macOS from in recovery mode (assuming you don't have anything else plugged into your Mac).\nYou can safely ignore it as it is just an installer.\nYou have wiped the drive. Boot into recovery mode and reinstall macOS. That will have the added benefit of overwriting the disk with new data making recovering your personal data all that more difficult to recover by the next owner.\n", "Q: Keychain sync on Mac and iPhone I have a MacBook (10.12.6) and an iPhone  (IOS 10.3.3).\nI configured Safari to save my passwords on websites, and I changed the default password of 'login' on keychain.\nThis way, the only way to see the saved password on Safari is using this master password I set on 'login' item on keychain.\nMy problem is the iPhone's Safari does not know the password I saved on my MacBook's Safari.\nBoth my MacBook and iPhone uses the same iCloud account, and the bookmark and history is in sync.\nThe only thing is not working is the password.\nIs it a limitation on IOS or it should work with that setup?\n\nA: The login keychain is a local keychain on your Mac and doesn’t sync to iOS. To use iCloud Keychain, you need to store passwords in the iCloud keychain which should be shown next to the login one in Keychain Access if you have the iCloud service enabled in System Preferences.\n", "Q: iOS Photos Crashes I recently merged a library of about 110,000 photos into my iCloud Photos library, using an iMac running Sierra. The process went slowly, but well and I can see the photos on other Macs and on my iPhone 6S running iOS 10. However, my iPad Air 2 started often crashing when I loaded the Photos app. At first it was intermittent, but now it is constant. I've tried disabling iCloud Photo Library, but it still crashes. I've alternated between downloading all photos and optimizing storage and that does no good. I've tried force quitting the Photos app, restarting the iPad, etc. Today, I even downloaded the latest beta of iOS 11 to see if that might do the trick -- the Photos app still crashes.\nIs there a way to completely reset the Photos app without wiping my iPad as a whole? Is there another way to try to fix this? \n\nA: Considering what you have already done it seems like something in the filesystem may be damaged. Whether it is a preference file of some sort, a bad photo or even a damaged app, there is no way to tell.\nApple has chosen to keep the guts of IOS hidden and inaccessible (well unless you're a dev or a jailbreaker...) making troubleshooting this both more problematic and simpler.\nSo you can't open the photolibrary file or delete preferences files like you can on macOS. Which would be suggestions you would see on a Mac.\nI am afraid your best method of fixing this is backing up the iPad, then wiping it completely and then restoring from the backup. Simple but (possibly) annoying.\n", "Q: Gray toothed wheel on Mac Finder \nWhat is the meaning of the gray toothed wheel on Mac Finder located right bottom?\nWhat is its name?\n\nA: It’s called an asynchronous progress indicator and serves to tell you that Finder is still loading the contents of the window, enumerating files and folders (and calculating sizes if you have that option turned on). This would suggest that the external drive you have opened is still being read from and not all the files/folders are shown yet in the window.\n", "Q: How to eject a unmounted disk? I was using the dd command to burn a .img file to a micro SD card which was connected to my mac through a usb SD card adaptor. I need to unmount(not eject) the device first before I could use dd to burn the image file. I did that with the umount command. After the burning was done, I unplugged the SD card adaptor when it prompted me that the device was not ejected properly. \nI was worried that I was doing it wrong. I tried to eject the device but couldn't find any icon in finder after the unmount. How should eject a unmounted device correctly? \nThanks.\n\nA: You can either use diskutil eject /dev/diskN, or in Disk Utility.app you can select the disk and choose File menu > Eject (Command-E).\n", "Q: FileVault 2 encrypted Fusion Drive on iMac doesn't boot anymore I bought a 2017 iMac, migrated the contents of my 2012 iMac (so I have my data! ) and I wanted to erase the 2012 iMac it replaces using Disk Utility in Recovery Mode.\nI had hoped this would be a minor step and after that I could sell my old iMac to partly fund the new one. But when starting the erase the computer got stuck. Because it got stuck I forced a shutdown with the power button.\n(The drive is a 1 TB Fusion Drive. In hindsight I think it might have been best to decrypt the FileVault 2 drive before erasing it)\nNow the computer starts up with a grey screen where I can type in my password. I think this screen is to unlock the FileVault encryption. But after doing that I get the black progress bar for a few mm. And then lines of bootloader/unix text presented over this grey screen and the iMac resets to the same loop.\nI've tried a lot;\n\n\n*\n\n*Starting in Recovery Mode; both local and through internet but text-lines and reboot again before it works\n\n*Starting in single user/verbose mode; doesn't work\n\n*Creating an external setup and installation USB to boot from that; can select it after press and hold of the option key at bootup but again lines of text and reboot\n\n*Getting a Thunderbolt 2 cable from a friend to connect my MacBook Pro 2013 in Target Disk Mode with Thunderbolt 2 (iMac2017 is Thunderbolt 3/usb-c) and try to boot from the MacBook Pro.

No errors found.\n\n*I attached the external display back which is attached by a Mini DisplayPort to DVI connector. Sometimes in the past the hardware seemed to get a bit confused when I had this screen detached. Attaching would help. Now it doesn't\n\n*And of course I have tried resetting NVRAM and SMC by way of cmd-option-P-R and unplugging for min. 15 seconds.\n\n\nOne of the lines at startup says:\n\nCoreStorage: fsck_cs has finished for group \"...\" with status 0x00\n  panic (cpu 2 caller 0xffffff00029fe39d): Kernel trap at 0x..., type 14=page fault, registers:\n\nAny clues to how I could fix this?

I tried internet recovery before and it didn't work but the adding of the shift key installs the recovery version of the original OS the computer was on when new. That way I was able to start terminal and wipe/fix the drives! I am now installing Mountain Lion from this recovery and then back to Sierra.\n", "Q: How can I diagnose save file issues in Xcode and on my desktop? There is something wrong about my mac (macOS sierra) , and it's happening for about 2 weeks , for example:\nI'm working with Xcode and suddenly i can't save any file, and I go to desktop , can't copy paste any item .\nI don't remember any error but I could not modify or create new file on my macbook.\n\nA: I would first boot to recovery mode - run Disk Utility until you have a clean filesystem.\nAt that point, I would try again using three apps - if all three apps can't write a simple text file to your desktop - it's going to be an account permissions issue.\nThe problem with user permissions is you'll need a new and functional admin account to fix things.\nIf you have a good backup - you could wipe the system, make a new admin account and then migrate things back. That would typically fix any permissions issues when you re-create the new user in the new home folder.\nAlternatively, you could boot to single user mode and remove the /var/db/.AppleSetupDone file and then boot your \"broken\" system and run through the setup assistant. Make a new admin with a new name like \"new admin\" and then use that admin account to delete and re-create your old admin user.\nSorry for the vague steps - you will need to have a troubleshooting / triage effort to nail down what specifically is failing and then ask a follow on question if you don't already find an answer here how to recreate a user, how to make a new admin account, etc...\n", "Q: Play feedback when volume is changed via touch bar There is an audible 'pop' when I change volume using the slider in System Preferences. I can also hear it when volume is being unmuted using the soft button on touch bar.\nI do not hear any feedback when volume is changed via touch bar. \nI have tried tapping touch bar volume button and then dragging the slider, tapping volume icons around the slider, pressing and holding volume button without releasing touch bar; none of them provide any audible feedback.\nThis is true for both built-in speakers and 3.5mm output.\nIs there a way of enabling feedback sound when volume is changed via touch bar?\n\nA: Start by going to System Preferences > Sound > Sound Effects. \nUnder the list of sound effects you should see two checkboxes, one labelled Play feedback when volume is changed. Check that box, and you should hear a feedback sound as the volume is changed. \nAny time you touch the volume up/down button or release on the slider you will hear the feedback sound.\nThis sound will be different from the one in System Preferences, sounding more like a 'tick'\n\nA: This isn't possible in Sierra, which is probably a bug. In High Sierra enabling ‘Play feedback when volume is changed’ in Sound preferences enables the feedback pop when releasing your finger from the slider.\n", "Q: Unexplained increase in downloads on iTunes Connect We're on our way to getting more downloads of iOS Apps in August than in the last 11 months combined. Sounds great, except we're not seeing any evidence that the apps are actually being run, e.g. automatic registration in the database. They're free apps too, so not making any money off these downloads.\nFew questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What's going on? Does someone have a bot that's repeatedly downloading our apps? If so, why?\n\n*If you have seen something like this, what happens if we switch one or more of the apps to paid, say lowest price tier?\n\n*If the downloads stop, then would they resume again if we switch back to free? We'd rather have lots of downloads, even if free, than get none.\n\nA: Noone here will be able to answer any of those questions.\nWe do no know which apps you offer on the App Store, and we do not have access to Apple's logs on who's downloading - neither do we know what the downloader's motivation is, nor if they're willing to pay for your app.\nThe only advice that can be given is \"try, and see what happens\".\n", "Q: Is MacBook Air 2017 used for programming viz Java or Python and also for Web development? I'm planning to buy a MacBook Air 2017 8 GB RAM with 256 GB SSD. The reason I'm going with a MacBook Air is primarily for portability and Battery life, since I see that it gives at least 10 hours.\nIs it good for performing the below activities? Please suggest. I have looked into MacBook Pro line as well, since, it is heavy, it would be difficult to carry around where ever i go.\nMy Primary Work:\nI would like to do only programming on this laptop, by installing IntelliJ IDEA IDE, PyCharm and WebStorm etc.\nI primarily work on programming languages such as Java, Python and Node.js for web development (even though am very new to web development)... I would like to run couple of containers on this device.\nI forgot to mention earlier that, in INDIA, we are having a amazon sale of Air 2017, which might end soon, hence, i was interested in going only for Macbook Air and nothing else, for now.\n\nA: To answer your question about the Air: Yes.  \nYou may want to consider broader options as well. For MacBooks in general, the biggest advantage to doing development on a them is that you get XCode and the best possible experience when developing iPhone/iPad apps and Mac apps. \nHowever in your case, it seems you're not doing mobile development, and price and/or weight are a concern since you're considering a MacBook Air.\nif you're open to windows, take a look at something like the HP x360 which is well reviewed and has advantages over the MacBook air:\n\n\n*\n\n*MBA is limited to 8 GB of RAM, while the HP allows 16 GB. This can be significant for software development.\n\n*MBA only supports old style USB 3. The HP supports USB type C 3 .1 that can charge the laptop or drive an external monitor.\n\n*HP has a watch band hinge that allows folding the screen back to be like the tablet. Not a big use case but actually helpful sometimes.\n\n*MBA resolution is 1440x900, while the HP resolution is full HD 1080p.\n\n\nPrice and battery life are very similar between the two in a 256GB/8GB configuration.\nOf course, Apple consistently has the best support and ability to use their stores.\nIf you have a hard requirement to stay on the Apple platform, I would suggest reconsidering the MacBook Pro 13. In general it's better suited to be a development machine, and it's really not that heavy to carry around.\n\nA: As the MacBook Air is a great computer, I can say yes for your usage. \nThe other alternative is the MacBook Pro 13’’ without touch bar. More power, a way better screen (important when you spend hours on line codes). \n\nA: I would get a MacBook over a MacBook Air if you can afford it. \n\n\n*\n\n*better screen\n\n*better storage\n\n*better CPU\n\n\nThe MacBook has NVMe storage which is superior to older technology in terms of iops and energy savings - for containers and dev work and compiling open source code - I’m very happy with the 2015 MacBook and the newer ones are even better. Any CPU in them is great so don’t feel you need to pay for the m7/i7 if you’d rather spend money on storage or accessories or a better display. In terms of productivity, you could program on a raspberry pi or three if you feel you need more “containers” to run. Unless I’m virtualizing something heavy like Windows - I don’t miss MacBook Pro CPU and hardware with my MacBook. That being said - the Air is also over qualified for what you describe.\n", "Q: OS X Mixed languages in dialogs I have a Macbook Pro 15\" with Touch bar and Touch ID. The company has been bought from a Finnish store, and its language was Finland when bought. I changed it to English after booting up the computer first time.\nNow there is an issue with OS language in some dialogs. Some OS dialogs show up in Finnish language, even when my only language in settings is English. Languages work correctly on my iMac and older MacBook Pro Retina.\nFor example, Thunderbird shows an OS dialog for entering password to secure storage, and its contents are in Finnish:\n\nThis is not limited to Thunderbird, but also other software show dialogs partly in Finnish language.\nSo, at first I just added English, chose it as a primary language and then deleted Finnish from Language & Region settings.\nWhen I tried to fix the issue, I added Finnish again, set it as preferred language and then removed it again. There was no change to behaviour.\nThen, I also tried the instructions described in https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7348459?start=0&tstart=0.\nThat is, I added and removed the Finnish language, tried reseting the PRAM and also ran sudo languagesetup, selecting Finnish as the language. None of these changed the behaviour.\nI wasn't able to find any other suggestions in Google.\nAny ideas what I can try?\nIs there some cache for language stuff that is out-of-date?\n\nA: After looking up into the issue more closely, I realised it was only ThunderBird initiated system dialogs that contained Finnish language.\nI was able to fix this by downloading Thunderbird again, making sure to download the English version, and then installing it over current installation. This fixed the issues with language dialogs.\n", "Q: Delete incompatible ScreenFlow version from MacOS Sierra \n*\n\n*I logged into my iCloud account from a fresh install of macOS Sierra.\n\n*I had a very old version of ScreenFlow (from 2011) under Purchases in the App Store.\n\n*Installing it worked.\n\n*When I try to open it (from the App Store or from Spotlight), it says it's incompatible and offers me to search for a newer version.\n\n\nNow how do I remove this old installed version? The App Store only shows me an \"Open\" button under Purchases, but I can't click on the icon to take me to a details page with an option to uninstall it.\nIt's harmless to just leave it there, but besides taking up a little disk space for nothing, it pollutes the Spotlight search index and just makes me feel my computer a little \"dirty\".\n\nA: Removing ScreenFlow from Your Computer\nTo uninstall ScreenFlow, simply move the ScreenFlow application to the trash.

I'm looking for a way to get the expiration date of a certificate from the command line. The certificate is in the default 'login' keychain and I know its name. How can I do this?\n\nA: GuyGizmo's answer doesn't seem to work with Xcode 10.1 tools on macOS 10.14.4. I pulled this way together after a few tries.\nSince I was trying to find out when my developer code signing certificate expires from the command line, I could readily look at apps that I had signed:\ncodesign --display --verbose --extract-certificates /path/to/dir.app\n\nThat tells you a certain amount about the app, and extracts the embedded signing certificate (without its private key, so there's no need for passwords) to a file called codesign0 in the current directory, in DER format. The other certificates in the chain of trust are extracted to codesign1, codesign2 and so on, for as many as are needed. It's probably best to remove them once you've finished with them. \nYou can then use the OpenSSL command-line tool to get the expiry date: \nopenssl x509 -inform der -in codesign0 -enddate -noout\n\nWhich prints a result like:\nnotAfter=June 8 10:37:33 2020 GMT\n\nAnother way to get the same information from the codesign0 file, in a format that may be easier to parse with a programming language, is:\nopenssl asn1parse -in codesign0 -inform der | grep UTCTIME\n\nThat will show you the beginning and ending dates in ASN.1 UTC time format, which is usually YYMMDDhhmmssZ in an Apple code signing certificate. Yes, the two-digit year does mean an ASN.1 UTC time wraps around every century.\n\nA: The following command works:\nsecurity find-certificate -c \"certificate name here\" -p | openssl x509 -text | grep \"Not After\"\n\n", "Q: Assign keyboard shortcut to Safari Extensions?

A minor annoyance with this particular application is the inability to cancel the screenshot when using the »selection« option (ie. the one that allows you to mark a specific rectangular portion of the screen, to be saved as an image). When I click the selection option, a pop-up window appears, stating that I with my mouse can pick an area to be saved as screenshot; this pop-up window also includes a cancelletion button, which can be used to cancel the screenshot before I start marking the area I want to save – after I start marking the area of the screen I want to save, there does however not seem to be any way to cancel the process (since there is no way to click the cancellation-button without releasing the mouse, and thus saving the screenshot), which is problematic when I, for instance, try to take a screenshot of a graph, only to discover that I have chosen my place of origen, such that some of the labels can't be included in the screenshot.  \nI do acknowledge that it only takes a few seconds to delete a failed screenshot and try again, but this is still quite annoying the times when I need to get a graph or figure just right and end up trying to make the selection many times. In such situations, it would be very helpful if only there was some keyboard-shortcut to cancel the selection, but as far as I have found, there doesn't seem to be any.  \nMy question is, therefore, does any way of canceling the selection screenshots exist.\n\nA: Grab is only actually the 'face' of the Mac screen capture experience.\nYou never need to launch it unless you want a delayed shot, with a 10 second wait before the shot is taken. That's the only thing [afaik] it can do that the regular built-in screen capture hot-keys can't.\nTo do a regular capture, without launching Grab, just hit  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   4  & a crosshair cursor will appear. Just drag a rectangle, same as in Grab & a screenshot will appear on your desktop.\n this is a screen capture, put into a quote block so you can see it's not just regular text\n\n\n\nYou can do this from anywhere in the Mac - any app, any time [except in some games].\nTo cancel - at any time, even in the middle of a grab, just hit  Esc  \nAnother very cool thing it can do...  \nAfter hitting  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   4  then tap the Spacebar & you can screen-grab any entire window, App or folder, complete with fancy drop-shadow, by just clicking the window...\n\nJust for the sake of completeness, if you hit  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   3  instead, you will capture the entire content of your screen[s].\n", "Q: Disabling iCloud Drive sync on specific Wifi networks Is there a way to do this ?

I've got a new MacBook Pro 15\" that comes with the 87W USB-C adapter from US.\nI live in Turkey and I've got all my MacBooks from US with US chargers, and had no issue with them (as they are meant to be used internationally anyway) for years.\nIt's been just one month since I've got my MacBook Pro. I don't know if it's relevant at all but yesterday we've tried connecting my MacBook Pro with my friend's MacBook over USB-C to transfer files (it didn't work, or we didn't know how to do it, but anyway) and my MacBook Pro started charging by draining my friend's MacBook's power. It was a 30 second thing, then we've disconnected them and I've charged/used by MacBook Pro for hours using the regular AC adapter for hours. Today it was charging perfectly at a coffee shop that I always visit (and charge my MacBook Pro). I came home and plugged it into the AC outlet that I also always use, but it didn't charge. It didn't even detect the charger (so it's not the \"not charging\" issue). I've tried my friend's charger and it works, I've tried my charger with my friend's MacBook but it doesn't charge either, so it's the adapter (we've also tested the USB-C cables by swapping, no effect, I've tried all the USB-C ports, no effect either). I've also tried SMC reset, no avail.\nHowever, there is one interesting catch: MacBooks always have this subtle \"shocking\" effect when they are connected to the AC outlet if I rub my hand on the unibody (it's something that happens with every MacBook I've seen on every charger, on every venue/house regardless of the outlet). Even though the adapter appears totally dead, I'm still having this shocking effect, so some power is delivered to the MacBook even though it's not charging. I've charged my MacBook Pro to 100% using my friend's charger, then I plugged it out and plugged in the \"dead\" charger. I've left my MacBook Pro attached to the \"dead\" charger in sleep mode (by closing the lid as I always do), left for about 4 hours, then came back. It was at 50% charge, almost as if the charger drained by MacBook Pro's battery (it's impossible for it to go from 100% to 50% in sleep, obviously, and there aren't any background apps that prevent sleep). When attached to the charger, it was probably still \"on\" as it was somehow \"detecting\" the charger (though doesn't detect it as a power adapter/charger) and has been on for 4 hours doing nothing with a turned off LCD, thus draining half of the battery (again, this is just my assumption). I'll probably get a replacement charger, but I'm really interested in knowing what's going on here.\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*No MacBooks are charging with a specific charger.\n\n*It just happened out of blue (no power outages, no liquid spill, nothing extraordinary other than I've tried connecting my MacBook Pro to my friend's MacBook over USB-C, but I've used and charged my MacBook Pro for hours on the now-dead charger for hours afterwards).\n\n*Even though it doesn't charge and doesn't detect the AC adapter in power reports, touching the unibody when the \"dead\" charger is connected still gives the \"electric feeling\", so there is at least something delivered.\n\n*Leaving the \"dead\" charger connected to my Mac apparently prevents sleep.\n\n*My MacBook Pro charges and powers perfectly with my friend's charger and my iPad charger (though they charge much more slowly because of much less power output).\n\n\nWhat might be happening?\n\nA: \nWhat might be happening?\n\nYou have a defective charger.  It's not unheard of and if you are a manufacturer of products, it's quite common.  With every single product that is made around the world, there is a percentage that fail.  This is called a defect percentage or rate.\n\nThe total number of defects counted on the population in question\n  divided by the total population count.\n\nAt one point, Apple was expecting a 10% defect rate on iPhones made by Foxconn.1\nDoes this mean that they are just going to let defects go?  Of course not, but being that these are complex products dependent on the manufacturing processes of other vendors, defects are bound to show up.  Even with the best QA processes in place, it's not perfect.\nYou received a charger that failed.  This is why they offer you a warranty.\nAs for the electric feeling, this also is a common occurrence and has been discussed on this site:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I avoid my MacBook Pro giving me minor shocks?\n\n*Is it bad that my MacBook Air is passing me electricity?\n\n*Avoiding electrical shocks/statics\nBasically, it boils down to the adapter not being grounded/earthed and using a 3 prong plug (applicable to your country) solves the problem.  \n\n1 Apple Expected 10% Bad iPhones from Foxconn?  Mark Graban's Lean Blog, May 6, 2013.\n\nA: Take it right back to Apple. Let them fix it and politely ask them what happened. Don't mess around with that much money. If you want to self-diagnose, hold down the power button for 15 seconds until you hear a chime and the light begins to blink slowly. This resets the PRAM.\nUSB ports on Macs are protected internally. If something goes wrong, they are disabled to protect them and the machine. I have a Canon camera that will crash the port if connected by a straight USB cable, but works fine with a cable that has a choke filter on it. The surge from plugging it in causes my Mac Pro to disable the port. Same thing with an external network adapter I bought.\n\nA: Because of the bathtub curve. Stuff is more likely to fail when it's very new or very old, so you should expect new stuff to be less reliable than moderately aged stuff. \n\nA: The charger was defective because of some sort of manufacturing error. If Apple will honour the warranty for a device bought in one country for use in another, get it replaced under warranty.\nIn general, the correct thing to do is to take it back to the store and get a replacement. In any sane country, you're legally entitled to a refund or replacement if you bought something defective, regardless of whether or not the item came with a warranty.   However, this doesn't really apply in your case, since you bought the laptop in one country to use in another. That's the risk you take by doing this: you get better prices but you have less protection if something goes wrong.\n", "Q: Reducing the number of fonts available to specific applications? It is not wise to install every font there is.\nThis slows down the system, your workflow etc.\nFor different projects and applications I need a certain number of fonts available. These are numbered significantly above the core fonts needed to run the operating system. That number is still manageable by hand.\nBut when using for example a web browser I want to restrict the number of fonts available from the system to them severely. \nExamples: I need Arial available to me and my word processors. I do not want to see it on web pages. Browser fingerprinting is also affected by the fonts installed (as seen through the browser).\nUsing Writer I want to have the full set available, using image editors they should be almost font agnostic. But web browsers being the main concern here.\nWithout resorting to big iron font managers, user switching, VMs or the like, and not counting javascript modifications to the browsers while running:\nI am aiming for something like at least two profiles for two kinds of programs running under the same user: 1. full set available 2. sandboxed/restricted set.\nHow to force programs into seeing just a very small and clearly defined subset of installed fonts otherwise available to the system or the current user?\n\nA: There doesn't appear to be an easy solution. Here's the best I could come up with.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Font Book, reduce the font set to the \"minimal\" set by disabling fonts as appropriate.\n\n*Create font \"collection\" folders in some directory of your choosing by symlinking to fonts in one of the font locations as appropriate.\n\n*On an app-by-app basis, within the application bundle:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory within the resources folder that symlinks to one of your \"collections\" folder\n\n*Add the ATSApplicationFontsPath to the info.plist file as appropriate.\n\n\n\nIdeally there'd be a way to specify font collections rather than font folders, but it seems like Apple intends this to only be used with prepackaged fonts, not by the end user. If you're keen on using the Font Book GUI, you could read from the ~/Library/FontCollections folder and automate step 2. You could also take it a step further and automate step 3.\n", "Q: Path to the Folder where Widgets are stored! There are lots of useless widgets in the notification center of macOS, so does anyone knows where these widgets are stored in the system, I want the path to that folder in-order to remove the useless ones to the trash.\n\nA: Part of CoreServices\nThe widgets are stored within /System/Library/CoreServices. They are plug-ins of small applications of the same name.\nFinding Widgets\nWidgets contain an Info.plist file containing the text com.apple.widget-extension. You can use this text to search for other widgets.\nA full disk search from the command line would be:\ngrep -r 'com.apple.widget-extension' /\n\nSystem Integrity Protection\nNote that these widgets are protected by macOS's System Integrity Protection (SIP).

I tried to find out their exact location, it seems to be iCloud Drive / iBooks (via Cmd+I) but when I try to navigate there from iCloud Drive, the iBooks folder doesn't show up, even when I turn hidden files on.\nIs that a bug or how come this behaviour?\n\nA: you can't see it when you browse iCloud Drive in the Finder, a easy way to get to it:\nOpen any PDF; when it opens in Preview, right-click the titlebar and click \"iBooks (iCloud)\". When the iBooks finder window opens\ndrag the iBooks folder icon in the titlebar to your sidebar. now you have quick access to your ibooks.\nYou can now drag and drop books on that folder and they will be there when you open iBooks app.\n\nIn Mojave it appears it's no longer possible to drag the Books (formerly iBooks) folder icon to the sidebar.

Then I used an option in that utility to open in finder, and found a shared folder called Books.  Get Info showed \"Where: iCloud Drive > Books\".   Then, without selecting a book, I added that folder to my side bar.   Kind of clumsy, but this may be useful.\nI tried telling the finder to go to places mentioned in posts above, but failed.

I have installed TortoiseHg on my Mac. I can run it, and it opens the repository browser. However, unlike on Windows, it doesn't add new items to Finder context menu. So I cannot right-click a file or a folder and do 'commit'. How can I perform commit then, without going to Terminal level?\n\nA: To do this, you would need to do basically two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an Automator Service that commits the job\n\n*Add the Service to the context menu\nBoth of these topics has been answered here on Ask Different; I linked to two excellent examples.\nWhat you would have to do is create an Applescript or a bash script (bash probably being easier) that \"commits\" whatever it is you want to commit - you will have to scope the requirements in detail.   Once you have the script written, add it to the context menu.\n\nA: While @Allan's answer gives a nice explanation of how to add the commit command to the file context menu, what I was looking for was just a way to commit files without resorting to the command line.

(If both are false then the true event is not evaluated.)  Otherwise, if both are empty, the IFERROR will return the empty string as, for some reason, an empty string in Numbers is not treated as a Boolean false like in programming languages such as JavaScript.  \nSee the example below.

This message does not show up on the default terminal app though.\nI am using zsh.\n\nA: This is the same issue I got on my mac OS. I am using zsh shell.\n\nCompdef is basically a function used by zsh for load the auto-completions. The completion system needs to be activated. If you’re using something like oh-my-zsh then this is already taken care of, otherwise you’ll need to add the following to your ~/.zshrc\nautoload -Uz compinit\ncompinit\n\nCompletion functions can be registered manually by using the compdef function directly like this compdef  . But compinit need to be autoloaded in context before using compdef.\n\nA: After more research, I have found my answer. There was a block in my .zprofile:\nexport NVM_DIR=\"/Users/Aaron/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"  # This loads nvm\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"\n\nThe last line loads compdef.

Update nvm using the install script and the error should go away (tested with v0.37.2)\nI had the same problem, after some research I found that the root of the issue was a nvm code snippet in the .zshrc (could also be .zprofile) file.\nexport NVM_DIR=\"/Users/Aaron/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"  # This loads nvm\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"\n\nLike suggested in another answer, commenting the third line does solve the issue, but, surprise surprise, bash completion for nvm commands will not be available anymore.\nThe real problem is at the end of the bash_completion script:\n# complete is a bash builtin, but recent versions of ZSH come with a function\n# called bashcompinit that will create a complete in ZSH. If the user is in\n# ZSH, load and run bashcompinit before calling the complete function.\nif [[ -n ${ZSH_VERSION-} ]]; then\n  autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit\nfi\n\nBut to call bashcompinit, compinit must have been called before and at this time it isn‘t. (I think this should/could be fixed in the nvm script, I will create an issue on github.)\nIf you want to have nvm completion, you can just call compinit yourself before the script runs.\nautoload -Uz compinit\ncompinit -i\n\nexport NVM_DIR=\"/Users/Aaron/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"  # This loads nvm\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"\n\nThe -i option tells compinit to silently ignore all insecure files and directories, which might prevent further errors in the future.\n\nA: I also receieved this error, but I had a different solution. \nMy .zshrc file had this:\n# Setup Kubectl completion\nif [ /usr/local/bin/kubectl ]; then source <(kubectl completion zsh); fi\n\n# The next line enables shell command completion for gcloud.\nif [ -f '/Users/my-user-name/google-cloud-sdk/completion.zsh.inc' ]; then . '/Users/my-user-name/google-cloud-sdk/completion.zsh.inc'; fi\n\nI needed to place the kubectl completion part AFTER executing the completion.zsh.inc script:\n# The next line enables shell command completion for gcloud.\nif [ -f '/Users/my-user-name/google-cloud-sdk/completion.zsh.inc' ]; then . '/Users/my-user-name/google-cloud-sdk/completion.zsh.inc'; fi\n\n# Setup Kubectl completion\nif [ /usr/local/bin/kubectl ]; then source <(kubectl completion zsh); fi\n\n\nA: It depends on what you set as your default (login-)shell for the system, for Terminal, for iTerm. Updated bash installed and set to execute in one of them gives differing results.\nThis error comes from a so called dot-file you installed. These are files with a dot in front (hence the name) like .bashrc. That means they are invisible to the Finder and to a simple ls. \nThe dot-files in question are read by your shell when it starts up. They contain instructions, settings, customisations; maybe little snippets of program code.\nNot all dot-files in your users home directory are read by the shell.\nThose read by bash may include: \n.bash_history\n.bash_profile\n.bash_prompt\n.bash_sessions\n.bashrc\n.editorconfig\n.exports\n.functions\n.inputrc\n.profile (This list is not exhaustive)\nThose files may have been created by you, manipulated by you or by certain programs like fink, homebrew or ports.\nYou may have just copied those from the net to \"upgrade\"/personalize your shell.\nRegardless of how you arrived at the current situation. Open your Terminal/iTerm from another user and the symptoms will probably not be observed.\nThat means: all those files are in a sense 'safe to delete': in the sense that they are not essential for running your Terminal or your shell. Make a backup of those in case they indeed contain personalised settings you may depend on in your daily work. Examples for that include additions to your $PATH variables. Without those you may find programs like fink no longer working.\nHowever the actual error message you posted indicates two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The combined content of your dot-files did not work to accomplish what they were supposed to do. More exact: an instruction (compdef) was called and that is not available.\n\n*That you very probably sourced a bunch of dot-files from a source on the net like holman-dotfiles.\nThese included a bug that had the exact same error message.\nSo you should look through all of the dot-files for your current user and keep only the stuff you recognise as necessary (remember the backups). Then you might use the updated files from your source again. But keep in mind that these are quite 'comprehensive'. It would be prudent to not use them all blindly and actually test and pick a subset of all those options.\nUsing them all blindly or indiscriminately may not only lead to issues like the one prompting this question but also when following other how-tos or troubleshooting advice.\nUpdate:\nThis answer was given to a previous version of the question that did not indicate zsh as the shell used. -> Substitute zsh where you read bash above.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to your Home folder\n\n*Press Cmd+Shift+. to reveal the hidden files\n\n*Locate the .zshrc file & open it in a text editor\n\n*Add the clear command to the end of the file\n\n*Save it and reopen your Terminal\n\n\n", "Q: iPod touch activation lock 3 years after So, 3 years ago I found an iPod touch.

Without knowing specifically how they handed over the iPod, it's impossible to tell. Always follow the official Apple guide when trading equipment, especially turning off Find My iPhone.\nUnfortunately, there's probably nothing you can do. Apple will remove activation lock only under the following conditions, which you don't meet:\n\nOfficially Remove Activation Lock steps are documented by Apple at\n  https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/ \n\nIn a nutshell, the various ways to remove iCloud Activation Lock\n  include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Apple will remove the lock if they can verify the original purchaser is requesting the action.\n  \n*Self-service removal if you can authenticate as the iCloud account that placed the lock on that device.\n  \n*Business using DEP can often use their MDM to remove the lock as a self-service action without needing Apple to be involved.\n  \n  \n  For consumers, you will likely need to make an appointment at an Apple\n  Store and provide the Genius on-hand proof of purchase (to show you're\n  the authorized owner) along with proof of identity and they will reset\n  Activation Lock, giving you access to the device.\nFor businesses, it depends if you are enrolled in DEP - Apple's\n  Device Enrollment Program or just want to provide copies of the\n  original purchase listing serial numbers to verify ownership.\nIf you bought the device second hand, stole it, found it or came to\n  possess the device by some means other than buying it from Apple\n  directly, then you will probably need the original owner to show proof\n  of purchase, etc. They will then transfer the device to your account\n  or simply disable Activation Lock.\nThe only self-service way to remove the lock if you can't type your\n  password into the device itself is to authenticate at\n  https://icloud.com and remove the activation lock when the device is\n  not connected to the internet.\n\n", "Q: Bulk Changing Application Icons on System So the question is pretty straight forward. I've disabled SIP (System Integrity Protection) and I am able to use the \"copy paste\" method, described in numerous tutorials, successfully to change my Application Icons. I'm wondering however if there is a folder where all the Application Icons are stored. I know that the Trash Icons and the Finder Icons are located at System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources and that I'm able to for all intensive purposes \"click and drag\" the new trash and finder icons to this folder and it update the icons accordingly.\nIs there a central location where all Application Icons are stored so that I can click and drag all 50 of my 'new' icons to a folder and then restart the dock app to refresh the icons?\n\nA: @klanomath is close, but you actually can bulk change the icon. While the .icns file is stored within the application, it's referenced in an .xml file known as info.plist inside the Contents folder of every app. There's a string CFBundleIconFile with specifies the name of the .icns file inside the Resources folder.\nWhile simply finding every .icns file and changing it would probably work in most cases, it's not the best practice. While it's rare for .icns files to be used for anything other than application icons, some app bundles include multiple side apps. This method minimizes risk.\nIf you'd like, I'll gladly assist in building an app to fit your renaming needs.\n", "Q: MacOS 10.10 on 4 GB memory bloat: which launch daemons/agents/services can I disable?

Based on reading blogs, some are notorious (e.g. com.apple.bird), some are believed to be unnecessary, some cannot safely be stopped:\nclear; launchctl list | awk '($2 == \"-44\") { print $3 }' | sed -e 's/com.apple.//g' | sort -f \n\ncom.apple.\naccountsd, AirPlayUIAgent, bird, CalendarAgent,\nCallHistoryPluginHelper, CallHistorySyncHelper, cfprefsd.xpc.agent,\ncloudd, CloudPhotosConfiguration, cloudphotosd,\ncoreservices.appleid.authentication, coreservices.uiagent,\nDataDetectorsDynamicData, icloud.fmfd, iconservices.iconservicesagent,\nimdpersistence.IMDPersistenceAgent, InputMethodKit.UserDictionary,\ninternetaccounts, MailServiceAgent, Maps.mapspushd, nsurlsessiond,\nnsurlstoraged, pbs, photolibraryd, pluginkit.pkd, printtool.agent,\nrecentsd, secd, secinitd, security.cloudkeychainproxy3, soagent,\nspindump_agent, tccd, telephonyutilities.callservicesd\n\n\nA: In the hope that the following is enabling to disable.\nApple-Bloat is such a common concern, it should have its own trademark registered. Especially in circumstances or environments that require a maximum of CPU power, minimal latency or where users have to make do with what hardware they have. Audio related scenarios being the most common. \nNot nearly enough can be disabled through the GUI-tools available. So this is an excellent question for a start. But these circumstances have to be clearly defined. Disabling almost everything can also disable the entire system. Prepare your bootable backups! Do not change anything before you know how to reverse it. Some of the following advice can be uncomfortable to deal with in its consequences. \nIt is of course the very first step to uninstall everything you do not need that is not from Apple – first. Every kext, every LaunchDaemon, every App, and every program not strictly needed has to go. Clean out the corresponding folders in /Library/ and ~/Library/. This also implies that Migration Assistant is now your enemy, and a clean install is your ally.\nIn very memory constrained circumstances it is also advised that you limit your use of the Desktop as a storage space. And your use of the Finder.app.\nHaving many icons on the Finder Desktop leads to increased memory consumption.\nThat means also the Finder has to go:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool true\nDo not worry. This is just adding a regular quit menu to your beloved file manager. When not needed, Finder can now be quit, stays quit, and releases memory. When needed for file related operations, you bring it back with simple click on the first Dock icon.\nYou have to make a complete list of things you know 'that are there' but you are sure you do not want.\nYou have to make a list of things and functions/services you really care for. Both lists have to be tested against later.\nYou will spend quite a time in Activity Monitor and Console. This is a tedious process.\nAfter you went through the list of running processes you should investigate everything you either do not recognise or recognise as most probably unwanted. Look them up and net-search the process name. \nSince this is not a wiki with unlimited space I cannot list every process judged by one or many as \"bloat\" or \"can safely disabled if unwanted\". That also depends too much on what else above \"iCloud\" should go.\nApple is really bad in documenting these things for the average end user just sitting at his system. It looks like macOS favours the \"no user serviceable parts inside\" approach. So you have to evaluate carefully what you find on the net. Try to spot glib analyses (or at least glib summaries / writeups) that contain little detail other than Apple-knows-best handwaving. \nWhat's funny about this? Apple indeed knows best. They just choose to hide that knowledge away. It is in parts on their website instead of giving you tooltips and installed documentation. Those parts that are accessible there are further in a format that needs some processing by the end user. Try your luck at Apple at for example: Daemons and Services Programming Guide.\n You can and should of course double check at their user forums (prepare a large salt shaker to have an adequate supply of grains ready). Or this very site or the others. Just keep the presumed quality level of each source in mind.\nMost of the processes running and displayed in Activity Monitor can be (force) quit. This is generally quite safe to do in a testing setting when no important work is open in the background or things like that. (Caveats apply!) That way you can test one by one and empirically see what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*do they respawn immediately or after some time or not until after a reboot?\n\n*is something unexpected not working after you disabled the process?\n\n\nIf nothing unexpected happens, you can then go the next step. \nThere was an excellent list of known processes and a brief explanation of them \ncalled “Know your Mac OS X processes”. This is very sadly gone but still visible at archive.org: https://web.archive.org/web/20170222052540/http://triviaware.com/macprocess/all \nThat means of course that it is a bit outdated to begin with, but still more up-to-date than most of the top search engine hits today. Since you are on Yosemite this is less of a concern for the current situation.\nNow make yourself familiar with launchd and launchctl.\nThe first is the daemon that loads all \"this crap\" (your words) and with the second you can interact with launchd and control it.\nSeeing that killing a process is without ill effect for your needs means you can instruct the system to disable that 'service'. You might use launchctl to do that or any of the programs available to accomplish this with a gui, like \n\n\n*\n\n*Lingon https://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/ or \n\n*LaunchControl http://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/\nLook at the job and try to understand what it does.\nStop a job and see what happens. Then disable the job and see what happens. Make pauses in between and reboot often to see you didn't mess up too much that might be needed at boot time or only once.\nDealing with completely unexpected consequences can be hard, since sometimes there are really weird connections to be made. No need for Airplay? Uncheck all the boxes in the GUI. Disable everything that has airplay in its name. Easy. Everything works as expected afterwards. Except after a while you notice that iTunes keeps crashing on launch. No need for iTunes also? Good. Still want to use iTunes? Bad, bad. Too bad. Go back to your list of deliberately disabled services, re-eanable them one by one; to finally find out that iTunes insists on a SystemDaemon called com.apple.AirPlayXPCHelper. Expect the unexpected.\nTo give you a head start for things considered bloat: There are many collections on the net that try to accomplish what you want. The following is meant as a source to be read and analysed for inspiration. Do not just apply them! Read the docs for them! Pick what seems needed one by one. (Since you should be documenting your own findings anyway—why not publish them?)\nThey are not completely applicable to every version of OS X or macOS, some of them have differing revisions still online.

I tried taking the original data and dividing it by 10, or 100, and redirecting the Size: data to the new column, but the bubble size hasn't changed.\nI'm finding Numbers to be frustratingly counterintuitive, and haven't found any mention of this yet on the Numbers Help Page.\nEdit: I used a circle detecting script to find the eclipse in the frames of a video, then I plotted the x,y coordinates of each circle, and wanted to use the radius of the found circles for the size of the bubbles—there probably isn't enough variation to matter, but obviously being so large is useless.\n\n\nA: @user2421192's comment had the solution: apparently the bubbles are automatically scaled proportionally to the range of the radius data. So by adding a new row at the top of my data, without x or y data, but just a r radius value, rescaled the rest of the data.\nSince the radii I have don't vary by much, I decided to modify them with a formula, taking the exp of the original radius r divided by ten (exp(r/10)), and then setting my \"scale\" radius to 50 * max(radius) (of the rest of the column), which gives some variation in the bubbles that makes it a little clearer whether they're bigger or smaller than the rest.\n", "Q: How to undo pressing Don't Trust on Apple Watch I want to test out my watch app on Xcode. So I plugged my iPhone paired with an Apple Watch Series 2 into my computer. The iPhone displayed a dialog saying whether to trust this computer or not, I clicked on trust and the iPhone is properly displayed in Xcode. In a minute the same popup appeared on my Watch, however I accidentally clicked Don't Trust on the Apple Watch, now the watch doesn't show up in Xcode. Usually to fix this for iPhone I would just plug the phone into the computer again, but I tried that, and the popup did not reappear on my Watch.\nIs there a way to trust my computer again without erasing all datas on the Watch?\n\nA: I got the same message on my Apple Watch and responded \"Don't Trust\" since I had no idea what computer was trying to connect. Then I read this article so opened the Console app on my Mac. Initially it didn't show my Apple Watch under Devices. I think I had to connect my iPhone to my computer first before both my iPhone and Apple Watch showed up, the latter with an exclamation icon due to the \"Don't Trust\" response.\nI disconnected my iPhone from my computer and restarted the iPhone. I then reconnected it to my computer to check the status in Console again. I got the \"Trust this computer\" prompt on my Apple Watch again. After responding \"Trust\" this time and entering my PIN, the warning icon disappeared in Console after a few moments.\nIt should be noted that there may be delays before the Apple Watch shows up in Console. I think opening Xcode seems to hasten the discovery process but I'm not sure.

I have a wired ethernet connection, which I connect to the computer. I would then like to be able to connect to that same connection (and the LAN) on my iPhone over wifi. I followed the steps here (https://www.maketecheasier.com/create-wifi-hotspot-using-mac-os-x/) which worked, however, there is a problem. Whenever I do this, the Macbook acts as a router, not allowing me to access any devices on the original LAN the Mac is connected to. I would instead prefer if it acted more like an AP, allowing communication to flow between my iPhone and everything on the LAN.\nThanks in advance!\nEDIT: To clarify, the important thing here is that I can't access any devices that are already present on my LAN. I have an IKEA Tradfri hub connected via ethernet to my router. Also connected to my router is a powerline adapter. The second powerline adapter is connected to the Macbook I was talking about. So now, when I connect to the Macbook's wifi, I can't access the hub. (This is, however, possible from the Macbook - I checked via a ping request, there is no app available for mac as far as I know.) My Macbook is therefore acting as a router, where the ethernet cable is plugged in to the port which says Internet. I need it to act like an AP or a router where the ethernet cable is plugged in to a normal LAN port. I hope this clarifies the difference.

I have a USB3 drive with 128GB of storage.  It has been working normally up until this evening, when I tried to right click > eject the drive.  I received the following message:\n“Mymusic” is a partition on a disk that has 2 partitions. Do you want to eject “Mymusic” only, or both partitions?\n\nWhen I open Disk Utility, it only shows the one single partition listed under the drive.  I ran First Aid on the drive itself, and it reported no problems.  However, when I tried running First Aid on the partition, it failed because it could not eject the drive.\nIf I click on the drive in the list, and click Partition, it shows a pie chart and 100% of the drive is shown in blue, as one big partition taking up 100% of the disk.  The only thing that looks weird is maybe \"Child Count: 3\".\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, when I finally clicked \"Close All [volumes]\", I got this message:\nThe disk \"Boot OSX\" wasn't ejected because one or more programs may be using it.\n\nHitting \"retry\" continues to fail.  \nThe disk has been formatted several times, and the most recent format was about a week ago.  It has only ever had one partition (at least, that I added myself; and no one else has physical access to it).  I certainly never added a partition named \"Boot OSX\".  Maybe some malware or something? But I don't pirate software and am privy to attachments, security, etc.\nHere are a couple of screenshots, in case they help:\n\n\nI'm not sure how this can happen.

It was hard installing a triple boot system because each of issues with their boot loaders, but now everything works fine.\nI want to save the image of my SSD to an external hard drive. How can I do that?\n\nA: You can use the program dd to create a disk imgage of an entire disk (including hidden boot partitions etc.)\nI use a GParted live CD (linux) to boot from so the disk I want to clone is not in use.\nOnce booted I go first go to GParted to get the deviceid (/dev/sda or something like that).\nThen I open terminal to use dd.

Simply open Disk Utility from your Utilities folder in your Applications folder, choose the source drive from the left hand pane, then click on new image. Expand the file name box and choose a file name for your image, and make sure you select your new drive as the location to store the disk image. In theory, as long as you select the root drive, and not a partition, the image should contain all of your partitions which can then be mounted (as long as you are using a file system macOS supports) and read as well as restored to another drive.\nAdditionally, if you want to duplicate your SSD to another drive (erasing the other drive in the process) you can choose the destination drive from the left hand pane, and then click the Restore tab. Drag your SSD from the left into the text field which is labelled Source, and drag your destination drive from the left into the box that says Destination.\n", "Q: Is it possible to see only the pictures I've taken on my iPhone? I'm using an iPhone 5S, running iOS version 10.3.1.\nI'm part of a chat group where a lot of pictures are posted.

It gets all your photos, excluding an album(select album your chat photos are stored) and also screenshots(you can disable it if you want).\nThe workflow will ask you if you want to save it all in a new album or in an existing one. You will need to run it each time to update the album.\nYou will need the Workflow app to run this.\n\n\nA: So, it definitely depends on the app you are using. However, embedded geolocation metadata isn't typically kept when exporting or importing shared shared photos (for privacy). So, if you do a search with a broad location as the term — say, \"United States\" — this will only select images that have this metadata, which typically will be the only photos taken on your phone (though it will also include those synced with iCloud from another phone, screen grabs, etc.).

The way the question in the title is framed might be of general interest. \nThe concrete problem or example that this question should be applied to is: \nFinding the optimal solution to hack an otherwise dead MacBook Pro (burned out AMD discrete graphics chip) back into usable condition.\nBackground:\nCurrent situation: fried dGPU, boot has to be forced into iGPU always. With default hardware settings and default system installation the machine will simply not boot.\nUnwanted side-effect for disabling the dGPU in software: AMDRadeonX3000.kext mustn't load immediately, if it does – boot hangs on Yosemite, freezes in Sierra and results in quickly forced reboots due to overheating in High Sierra before the GUI is up. Symptoms observable in Sierra, last line in verbose boot is: IOConsoleUsers IOScreenLockState 3.\nNot loading the kext at all: thermal management for AMD chip gets out of hand. Temperature never sinks below 65°C and easily spikes higher despite the chip not being used. \nDelayed loading: All is OK an the temperature side. GPU isn't idling at full power but idling at a much lower powerstate. Depending on OS version the sensors report temperatures ranging from 0°C–60°C. Although that reading seems not really realistic or trustworthy the whole unit also stays cooler to the touch. \nBut \"all is well\" only most of the time. Every now and then there are very rare sleep issues on Sierra, and alas: every time on Yosemite. \nFinding that the kext needs to be loaded for running the machine but is better not loaded (in the delayed manner at least) for sleeping the machine: an attempt to kextunload the seemingly responsible kext results in an immediate panic. This one paragraph is mainly of concern when on Yosemite but not so much on Sierra.\nOn top of that it may not be the optimal solution. Thermal management needs 1-2 minutes in the current configuration after loading the kext to stabilise into acceptable levels. Therefore the desire to rotate the kexts and see what might give best results.\nSteps taken so far:\nOne of the graphics driver kexts in Sierra needs to be loaded at/around/after boot, automatically, but later.\nThey are interdependent of course and all loaded as deemed necessary by the system under normal circumstances. \nBut the system will hang on boot if the one kext in question is loaded too early and the system runs exactly as desired if it is loaded later. \nIn this case I confirmed that loading it either manually or together with a GUI login via hooks works.\nHowever, this means that placing the kext in /System/Library/Extensions or /Library/Extensions results in the hang on boot as they are consulted too early.\nWhat also does not work is using system wide launchd agents or daemons since these are also consulted too early. Same daemons under user-hierarchies do apparently not have the necessary privileges to load a kext.\nSo where has this one kext from /System/Library/Extensions to go?\nHow can a delay be enforced that this kext is only loaded after all its up or down dependencies have been loaded?\n\"Which kext?\" you might ask.\nThis question is about all the AMD kexts, each to be tested individually.\nThis is in an attempt to further improve this guide.\nQuestions\nMain question: How can one of those graphics kexts be forced to a delayed load? (Other than the LoginHook method.)\nIf this proves suboptimal for the stated goal, it would be also nice, or even better to know:\nAre there other ways in software to keep the disabled dGPU under the thermal and power management rules of the system? (The less power goes through this unsused chip the better.)\nThat case may involve other kernel extensions as well.\n\nA: The easiest solution is probably to outright remove the offending kernel extension from /System/Library/Extensions, in your case AMDRadeonX3000.kext. You need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable System Integrity Protection. There are many guides across the internet on how to do this, but the short version is: reboot into recovery mode, open the terminal, and enter csrutil disable.\n\n*Copy /System/Library/Extensions/AMDRadeonX3000.kext to a safe space somewhere else on your computer, in case something goes wrong and you need to revert.\n\n*Delete AMDRadeonX3000.kext from /System/Library/Extensions.\n\n*Clear your kext cache. Open the terminal and run: sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions && sudo kextcache -u /. Then reboot.\nThe kext may reappear after updating macOS, in which case you'll need to repeat steps 3 & 4. For this reason, although you can re-enable SIP once the kext has been removed, I recommend just leaving it off.\nThe Hackintosh community has more persistent methods of disabling specific kernel extensions. If you'd like, you could look into installing the Clover bootloader, which is targeted at Hackintosh users but should work on official hardware as well. For your needs, however, I think simply deleting the kext is the best solution.\nEdit: This method will cause the dedicated GPU to continue receiving power, wasting the battery. In order to stop the GPU from receiving power, you will need to install Clover and then create a custom SSDT that switches off the GPU.\n\nA: There’s no documented way for a user (nor an admin) to delay the loading of KEXTs. System kernel extensions are being loaded by kextd, the “kernel extension server” according to its man page. kextd is started by launchd via a LaunchDaemon sitting here:\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.kextd.plist\n\nIn addition to this directory launchd also consults /Library/LaunchDaemons. There’s no defined order of execution of LaunchDaemon plists and there’s no delay option, either. That about does it for your options, I’m afraid.\n", "Q: Cycle though dropdown list using keyboard on Mac In many situations I'd be nice to select the next list item using a keyboard.\nSay I want to select \"Ava 614\" from the image below. I'd be nice to just hit the down arrow (or combo keys) then space bar, or return/enter to select. But that doesn't work. Up arrow selects the last item of the list, and down arrow selects the first item of the list.\nIs there a way to select the next item in a list using the keyboard?\n\nThere's a similar question, but still doesn't answer this specific question.\nSide question: is there isn't a system global shortcut is there one for Adobe Premiere CC?\n\nA: Looks to me that this is an Adobe-specific problem. In standard macOS dropdown menus, you can navigate to and select the item you want using only the keyboard. \nUp/Down keys move the cursor on the dropdown, while space is how you select the item you want. You can navigate to/from the menu using Tab. Here's an example.\nBonus tip: you can also quickly navigate the selected menu by typing out what you want to select, for example in a select a state menu, you can click it, then type T-E-X to select Texas.\n", "Q: Finder -- \"Open file with...\" offers incorrect list of candidate apps When I right-click -> \"Open with\" -> ...\nI see an option for atom 1.19.3 and 1.19.1.\nHowever Spotlight locates only one Atom.app (which is found in Applications).\nOpening with 1.19.1 succeeds.

I would usually restart my Mac to resolve the issue, but I have some code running on the same Mac, which will be done in several days only. Is there anything I can do now? \nWhat caused Preview to freeze was trying to open several EPS files simultaneously, and whenever I try to open Preview now, I see all those EPS files as currently open (their names are shown if I hover over the Preview icon). \n\nA: After having opened something that crashes an app, subsequent launches will automatically try to reopen the file that crashed it... & round you go in circles.  \nThe usual 'first-fix' for this type of issue is to clear the 'history' of what it was trying to open.\nMany apps store data in this way, that's how they can set everything back up exactly as you left it, after a reboot, etc.\nThey live in /Library/Saved Application State/\nspecifically for Preview, at ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState the file in here is an Alias - usually they're not so you can usually just delete the specific app's folder & it will recreate it as necessary - but for an Alias it's safer to follow it by right clicking & 'Show Original' which saves the Alias being accidentally broken.  \nDelete the contents of the original folder but not the folder itself & your App should launch cleanly.\n", "Q: MacOS Sierra - localhost not found while using Hugo (not related to Apache) note this is NOT related to Apache and I'm not looking for Apache-centered answers. \nI am using the Hugo static site generator to create sites and trying to test on a MacBook running Sierra. \nI am able to start the server with\nhugo server -Dw\n\nAnd the server starts on localhost:1313, however when I try to access that URL I get a 404. 127.0.0.1:1313 works, but then all of the links fail as they try to resolve back to localhost.\nI was able to access by enabling a domain name on my router (foo.home) and then I can open the main page with localhost.foo.home:1313, but all of the Hugo links still try to use localhost:1313.\nSo, two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I change the behavior of Hugo to use 127.0.0.1?

Is there an equivalent to this command in OSX?\nlocate --regex 'bin/(bz|gz|zip)'\n\n\nA: The macOS version of locate doesn’t have a regex option. You can use * and ? in the search pattern but that’s it.\nBefore you can use locate you will have to enable it (i. e. have the locate database built) using the following command—by default it is disabled:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist\n\n\nA: The default version of locate on OS X/macOS does not support this, like Tom E. indicated.\nApple ships the BSD version of most of the command-line tools (formerly called \"the BSD subsystem\").  \nTherefore there are two answers to your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*You might construct any number of equivalent command oneliners that accomplish the same as the one command you quoted. For learners, the keywords there are not only regex, but also pipes, backticks and some more.\n\n*But to consider your first line of context (\"learning linux bash\") the following answer may be more appropriate:\nYour example might be from a book like \"The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction\". \nThat is problematic to apply word for word or command by command on OS X/macOS. Apple mostly ships BSD tools and (almost?) all of them in very outdated and insecure versions (fanatical GPL3-allergy on Apple's side). Linux ships mostly GNU-tools that might/will have often the same names but differing features/options compared to their BSD equivalents.\nmacOS can therefore have not only an equivalent, but the exact same command and syntax you gave as an example. But for that you have to install the corresponding GNU tools. In your case above findutils. That contains the locate command in the flavour used by your example.\nThis is generally recommendable if you want to learn \"linux bash\". Install all GNU tools you might need to follow the examples. This also includes a current bash.

However if setting up a DNS is the medicine, I shall take it.\nUpdate 3: I think the question now becomes, how do I get the IP address on my host names from 127.0.53.53 back to 127.0.0.1? For more than 10 years I have used a hosts file with entries like 127.0.0.1 volhq.mmf.yii.dev & it has worked.\n\nA: Stealth Mode is a feature of the built-in firewall. If enabled, it simply keeps the firewall from responding to ”ICMP echo requests“ (aka Pings). It doesn’t keep browsers from connecting to a web server.\nIn your case, the reason could be a problem with your DNS configuration. Please check both the client’s and the server’s DNS setup.

So for a very long time this question has been asked and asked again: How can you play audio from the built-in speakers with the headphones plugged in?\nWhen other people's Macs are dual booted (including mine), into Linux, or Windows, it is very much possible to switch between the built in speakers and headphones. The same with the startup chime, which sounds through the speakers with the headphones plugged in. \nIt's not hardware [or at least, not always], so where is the cause found in software?

Are there any tips/ideas as to how I can organize them in a nicer and cleaner way?\n\nA: Is doesn’t matter if you use a mail sorting rule (found in Mail’s preferences) to move the mail to the target mailbox of your choice or if you create a smart mailbox to display the mail which will keep staying inside the inbox. All you need is a rule of this type:\nAny recipient is aliasname@maildomain.com\n\nThis should separate your mails to different mailboxes as you described.\n", "Q: Move windows between displays without dragging I'm using a 2011 iMac running MacOS Sierra with an HDMI output connected to a projector. When I want to watch a film on the projector, I just drag iTunes over to the second display and watch. If I forget to drag iTunes back, it ends up stuck on the other display. This is because the Mac still sees the second display when the projector is turned off. This means the only way to get iTunes back on the main iMac display is to turn the project back on so I can see the iTunes window and drag it back across to the main display. This also happens to any other app I \"leave behind\" on the external display and forget to drag back over. What I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quitting and relaunching the app. This doesn't work, as MacOS remembers which display the app was on previously and re-launches it on that display\n\n*Finding the app in Mission Control. This doesn't work, because each display has its own Mission Control. I therefore can't see the spaces on the external display in order to grab the iTunes window and drag it to a space on the built-in display\n\n*Right-clicking the app icon in the dock and selecting \"Show all windows\". This just displays my wallpaper with a message in the centre saying \"No available windows\" (presumably because the window is on the external display).\n\n\nI am hoping there's a key combination or some other trick to force the windows of the app to move over to the current display.\n\nA: If you want a trick, you could briefly unplug the HDMI cable from the iMac. That should signal Mac OS that there is only one display and it will move all windows to the only remaining display.\n\nA: The following Applescript does the job:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set position of windows to {100, 100}\n    activate\nend tell\n\nI did try adding text input so you could use it for other apps too, like this:\nset theApp to the text returned of (display dialog \"Which app do you want to bring back?\" default answer \"\")\n\ntell application theApp\n    set position of windows to {100, 100}\n    activate\nend tell\n\nUnfortunately it then no longer recognises the 'position' attribute of 'windows'. I considered wrapping the tell block in using terms from application theApp, but this didn't work as using terms from application seems to require a named app, not a variable. Forcing it with using terms from application \"iTunes\" works if you type \"iTunes\" into the text prompt, but any other app causes an error in matching the position property.\nI have knocked up a quick app in XCode which provides the text input for the name of the app, and then embeds this in an Applescript. The Applescript moves all of the windows of the specified app into the position specified by xOffset and yOffset, on the currently selected display. The app could be made nicer by adding a selection menu of the currently running apps, or even a way of specifying the position the windows should be moved to. This wouldn't be difficult to do, so I might play around with it some time.\nAnyway, the source code for the app is on GitHub, so if anyone else finds it useful, here it is.\nhttps://github.com/mashers/BringAppsBack\n\nA: Although I'm currently not able to test them, since I don't have a second display at hand right now, I had some ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is an option in Mission Control Settings called \"Displays use separate spaces\". Can you see the spaces of your projector in Mission Control on your Mac, with this option unchecked?\n\n*If you use iTunes in fullscreen mode, do you see it in Mission Control on your Mac? \n\n*\"Magnet\" from the Mac App Store gives you a keyboard shortcuts for moving windows between displays. Its currently reduced (at least in the Austrian MAS) and costs 1,09€ / ~1$.\n\n\nA: There are a number of tools allowing to do that.\nMy favourites are:\n\n*\n\n*Rectangle https://rectangleapp.com/\n\n*Better Touch Tool https://folivora.ai/\n", "Q: Authenticating to Server Services \"requires storing your password in a less secure form\" I've bought and downloaded the MacOS Server application to host a VPN and to host a Satis repository.\nWhen enabling either the VPN or Websites services, a dialogue appears asking \"Do you want to change how your password is stored?\", with the advice that \"Authenticating to this service requires storing your password in a less secure form.\"\nI can't find any further information on this, not from the Server documentation, nor from searching on Google.\n\n\n*\n\n*What does this actually mean?\n\n*Why is this necessary?\n\n*Does it pertain to my MacOS user account credentials? If so, will it only affect the credentials of the account that the Server application is being run from (if this is the case, I will create a separate user account to run the Server app)?\n\n\nMany thanks for your time and help.\n\nA: OS X stores your passworded in a \"salted hash\" one-way encrypted format (See this question which \"scrambles\" your password (combined with a \"salt\") in such a way that it can't be decrypted, but produces the same value every time.\nDepending on how Apache is configured, it uses different (normally salted) algorithms, including MD5, SHA1 and crypt: see the documentation\nThese are easier to crack than SHA-512, but also fairly secure (they do use a salt, and are one-way hashes. An attacker would need to get the htpasswd file to crack your password)\nThe same is true of the VPN server: I'm not sure what hashing algorithm it uses, but it's one with less entropy than the internal user database, which is what the warning means.\nIt's necessary because each piece of software is written by different maintainers (the web server by Apache, for example) and not by Apple, and because they store your password rather than authenticating you against the OS X user database.\nIt pertains to whatever users are allowed to authenticate to those services (the VPN and Web services) and not the user account that the Server app is running as.\n\nA: Building on @Josh's answer, There are some legacy services that require the use of a hashing algorithm called MS/CHAP. One of the unfortunate properties of the MS/CHAP hash family is that the stored hash is weak enough to allow the password to be retrieved. This is a problem if the file in the server containing the hashes gets stolen by an attacker. \nThe PPTP VPN server is one of the legacy services that use MS/CHAP. \nAll that said, you do not need to weaken the hash of the server administrator if that person will not be using VPN. Users created after Server.app is installed and set up will have their hashes weakened. You can use the pwpolicy(8) tool to see what hashes are saved for a user. If you have a user created before the VPN was started and you wish to have them use the service, you can go to the users pane and look up that user, you will see a message \"the user may not be able to access all the services\" with an option to fix. Choose fix.\nI think it is always a good idea to have a specific user for server administration tasks. So I encourage you to create a user for running Server.app and subsequently there will be no need to weaken the hashes for that user.\n", "Q: Different category behavior in GUI vs. AppleScript I'm seeing some weird categorization behavior on Outlook 2016 on El Capitan.\nIn the GUI's Category list, there's a category called, say, \"Category1\", with the color red.

I was able to resolve by applying the exact category id I wanted like:\nset end of theList to category id 33\n\nRather than like:\nset end of theList to category \"Category1\"\n\nHere is how I got the category ids. I selected a message in Outlook that had only the category I wanted and then ran this script manually from Script Editor:\ntell application \"Microsoft Outlook\"\n\n    set msgSet to current messages\n    if msgSet = {} then\n        error \"No messages selected.

I'm trying to make an automator service to quickly rename files. My job uses a file name syntax of 1234-01a-FileName.psd where 1234 is the job number, 01 the file number, and the a is a version letter, as in, version two will be 01b, etc. Getting the current letter with RegEx and incrementing it is easy, the issue I'm having is how to actually rename the file with JXA. Nothing I can find on google is actually answering this (I assume) simple question. I've tried a number of permutations of the following. Is there something basic I'm doing wrong here? \ntheFile = Path(\"~/Desktop/1234-12a-test.png\");\ntheFile.name = \"thisDoesntWork.png\";\n\nI could alternately have both a Run AppleScript and a Run Javascript in the automator workflow, and try to pass the name back and forth, but I'd rather keep it simple if possible.\n\nA: The Path object is a very basic structure and doesn't provide any actual filesystem functionality.

I'm looking to upgrade a 120GB SSD in my late 2009 iMac (21.5in) to a 250GB SSD. My mac is running the latest version of MacOS. \nI have an external USB drive which I will be setting up to create a Time Machine backup. My understanding is that once the backup has completed, I swap my internal SSD with the new SSD. Then, with keeping the USB Drive with Time Machine backup on it connected, I boot to it and some sort of Disk Utility software will walk me through restoring the Time Machine backup to my newly installed drive.\nThis is all good, but I have read mixed information about whether or not the Time Machine backup includes a complete backup of data and OS or if I will need to install the OS onto the new drive and update it before restoring from the Time Machine.\nI don't have a physical copy of the OS, so it concerns me a little. It's a second-hand Mac and came with El Capitan installed.\nDoes a Time Machine backup contain the OS as well so it's as simple as boot to a Disk Utility and tell it to restore from Time Machine to the new SSD?\nMy first Mac, so thanks for any help!\n\nA: If you haven‘t defined any exclusions in the Time Machine options then your backup drive will contain a full backup including system, apps, and user data.\nTo restore, you connect the backup drive to your Mac and press cmd-R when starting up. This will start from the Recovery system invisibly contained on the Time Machine disk. You’ll see an assistant window from which you select the first item, “Restore From Time Machine Backup“. Then you can select which of the saved backups you want to restore.\nIt’s as easy as that. But please make sure you use this mechanism only to restore a system onto the very same Mac you made the backup of. Don’t use it to restore a backup onto a different machine type as it could break your system if build versions don’t match hardware requirements. Should you want to restore a backup onto another system, Apple recommends you to use Migration Assistant (in /Applications/Utilities).\n\nA: You need to create a bootable USB before you do anything else. See this:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nAlso, while you should definitely make a full Time Machine backup, you can also use the old SSD as the backup from which you restore to the new disk. Essentially, as soon as you remove the disk, it becomes the backup.\n", "Q: How to remove preinstalled Apache and PHP from Mac OS Sierra I have been trying to figure out how to completely remove preinstalled Apache and PHP from my macbook pro ...

When browsing the above mentioned directory on my MacBook I find some old files and directories from months ago which are using up 1.5GB of space.\nCan these be safely deleted without incurring in problems?\n\nA: Yes, these can be removed without issue. The usual way to remove backups is through the backups list in iTunes Preferences, which shows the name of the device and the backup date, but there's no problem with removing the folders manually in Finder too.\n", "Q: Use AirPort as Time Machine whilst using internet I have an AirPort Time Capsule (model 802.11ac 2TB). I connect to the internet via my work's WiFi. I have managed to set up the AirPort as my Time Machine backup, and can connect to the device by switching my WiFi to the new WiFi network that the device creates. Although this allows me to perform backups, I cannot use the internet whilst I am connected to this WiFi device. Similarly, if I connect to my work's WiFi network, my MacBook cannot see the AirPort device and therefore cannot perform Time Machine backups.\nHow do I enable both use of the internet and background backups at the same time? Surely this must be possible.\nNote that I have a spare ethernet socket nearby, which I could plug into the AirPort device if this helps. Or, if the AirPort device is capable of doing so, I could register the device on the network and connect it to the work WiFi as well.\n\nA: You could connect your AirPort Time Capsule via Ethernet and turn off the box’s Wifi altogether. This way, it will become part of your existing (wireless?) network and you can back up and access the Internet at the same time.\nAny Airport device can be set up in “bridge mode” and they will join a network like any other computer as opposed to making their own network and requiring correct routing setup. \n\nA: To start, you are using the wrong device in that environment.  You should be using a USB (or Thunderbolt) external hard drive.  A network connection, wired and especially wireless will never be as fast as USB.\nCould you plug your Airport into the \"spare Ethernet socket.\"  Probably, but given that you said you have to \"register the device on the network to connect via WiFi\" tells me they have some sort of RADIUS or similar authorization taking place.  I doubt your network admins would appreciate the network being saturated with Time Machine traffic.\nYour solution:\nI would keep your TM off the corporate network altogether.  Get an Ethernet cable and connect your MacBook directly to the TM.  You will have to manually set the the IP addresses, but this is pretty straight forward.  This will give you a fast connection to your TM, you won't put unnecessary traffic on the corporate LAN and you will still be able to use your WiFi.\nPreferred solution:\nGet an external USB drive and backup to that.  There's much less complexity translating into higher reliability.\n", "Q: Letters getting inserted randomly as I type. Has this ever happened to anyone? I have a 2014 Retina MacBook Pro with Mac OS 10.12.4 and 16GB of RAM. Everything was fine until a few weeks ago when I started to notice strange behaviors:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"e\" and \"t\" characters in my keyboard randomly stop working and start working again in a few seconds. In the time that it doesn't work, if I hit \"e\" a few times to get it to work, it collectively adds all the \"e's\" in some other part of the text as I type. As far as I can tell, my SHIFT or other keys don't appear to be stuck, I didn't drop any liquids on the laptop or change any settings.\n\n*Spotlight used to work great. Now, when I type an application's name, it works sometimes and not other times. I checked Spotlight settings and it looks like Apps are enabled. I can barely find what I want with Spotlight anymore.\n\n*I usually sort my files by \"Kind\" in Finder. In the past, it would organize PDFs separately, images separately etc. It doesn't anymore even if I set it to \"Kind\".\n\n\nI'm not sure why it's starting to be buggy. My laptop hasn't fallen or anything. It's on my desk all the time. I've never really had to reset it. Could it be that it has a lot of junk files accumulated from usage? Anyone else experiencing these? What can I do?\n\nA: Yes this happens due to several causes. USB hub issues (there are several internal “hubs” that can fail - liquid damage is a likely cause, but not the only one). Connecting faulty or failing usb and Bluetooth input peripherals is also a likely cause until you rule that out. \nLastly, software automation could be a far less likely cause. Booting a brand new OS on an external drive might be a good way to check for that rather than erasing and reinstalling your Mac. \n\nA: Whenever I see strange behavior, the first thing I try is Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, because it's just a good idea to get a clean bill of health. Things like MacKeeper (and lots more) are very clever/tricky and might be installed on your system without your knowledge.\nI also had key issues for the home row, but it turned out to be an old, dying keyboard. (I use the Dvorak layout, so 65+% of what I type is on the home row: aoeuidhtns.) I replaced the keyboard. But, I would be very surprised if your keyboard were damaged with a 2014 model. But, it's still a possibility.\nFinally, have you tried booting in Safe Mode (restart computer while pressing Shift key until login screen)? Do you still experience the symptoms?\n\nA: I would boot from a different disk or hold CMD R to boot in Recovery mode. From there you can try to check if the problem is gone.

It's a bug of iterm2 which can't fully support complicate output. Sometimes, TUI crashes too when using vim and multi-windows setting. \nApple likely has left gcc and gdb behind.

On a 2008 Mac Pro (a.k.a. MacPro3,1), it apparently has 2 PCIe 2.0 slots and 2 PCIe 1.1 slots. While the difference won't prevent any PCIe device from working, it does make a difference for speed.\nI recently ran GPU-Z under Windows 7 and ran the load test (a '?' icon off to the right next to text about PCIe versions and number of lanes) and found that it stayed at PCIe 1.1 x16. This is with a Radeon HD 270X which is definitely PCIe 3.0 compatible, so I'm a bit surprised it didn't report 2.0!\nTrying to look at Intel 5400 chipset documentation, it would seem that the chipset only supports PCIe 1.0/1.1, but all documentation on the MacPro3,1 that I've seen suggests that the first two slots support PCIe 2.0 (which I presume is direct into the CPU rather than the northbridge).\nAny confirmation on the spec here? As well, why would GPU-Z only be reporting PCIe 1.1? Could it have something to do with the fact that I have a USB 3.0 card in slot 4?\n\nA: If that is a PC (non-EFI) graphics card, running it in Windows on a Mac (Bootcamp) will reduce the speed to PCIE 1.1\nYou must have an EFI flashed card to run at PCIE 2.0 in Windows on Mac machines. Drivers solve this issue for some PC (non-EFI) cards in OS X, but not Windows.\nReal world gaming difference between 2.0 and 1.1 will likely be negligible, and your bottleneck will most likely end up at the CPU or OS X drivers. Generally I see better performance in Windows.\nFor reference I run a GTX 1060 (non-EFI) on a 2009 Mac Pro; my benchmarks and real world gaming are all better in Windows, at the PCIE 1.1 speeds.\n\nA: Obviously I can only comment on how you've described things in your question, but the results you describe don't quite make sense to me. \nThis model Mac Pro does indeed have two PCI Express 2.0 slots and two PCI Express 1.1 slots. However, while the two PCI Express 2.0 slots are x16, the two PCI Express 1.1 slots are x4. So, getting a result of PCIe 1.1 x16 really isn't right. In other words, the x16 would indicate PCIe 2.0, not PCIe 1.1 that is only x4.\nBy default one of the PCIe 2.0 x16 slots was occupied by the GPU, which presumably is where you also have your Radeon HD 270X installed. But if you had it installed in one of the PCIe 1.1 slots, then it should be reporting PCIe 1.1 x4.\nIn a nusthell, GPU-Z reporting back PCIe 1.1 x16 makes no sense.\n\nA: Looking at the Official Apple Technical Specifications page, it says the following re:  PCI expansion\n\nPCI Express expansion7\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Three open full-length PCI Express expansion slots  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*One PCI Express 2.0 x16 slot  \n  \n*Two PCI Express x4 slots\n  \n  \n\nSo, according to Apple, the x16 slot is PCIe 2.0\n", "Q: How to add suite or apartment number to location in Calendar How can the suite number, apartment number, etc. be added to the location in Calendar on MacOS and iOS?\nIf an address is typed locations are suggested and Time to Leave alerts are enabled, but as soon as the address is modified Calendar no longer recognizes it as a valid address.\nNo Suite:\n\nWith Suite:\n\n\nA: Entering the suite or apartment number on a separate line with a trailing comma, the address will display on the map as valid.  \nThe Suite number can even be on the same line as the city and it will work but that just looks odd. \nTo add a new line use control+return\n\n", "Q: Unable to reinstall Mac OSX without an Apple ID that I don't know I was recently given a retired MacBook pro from my work.  It's a 2009 A1278, originally shipped With OSX Leopard 10.5.7.  When I try to reinstall, it asks me for an Apple ID.  Nobody around the office recalls what that might be, since it was 8 years ago when it was originally purchased, and the records from that time were messy at best, and we've gone through a substantial management change since then as well.\nI'm considering buying a new install disk from Apple, but they don't seem to sell 10.5.7.

Searching for answers on how to change the layout used in that mode came up empty.

It's about as minimal an environment you can possibly get and what gets mounted will depend strictly on what you want to do.\nThe keyboard mappings don't occur until well into the boot process - after drivers have been loaded for the various devices (like the keyboard)\nIs it possible (likely) that Apple has compiled different kernels for different regions?

I have just synced ~7700 photos/videos from my iPhone to my Windows 8.1 laptop, but I wish to view these files, except I cannot seem to find these files in a viewable format, so I can sort through them.\n\nA: The default location for Windows photo imports is the Pictures folder in your user account, but can be changed (and you can see where it is set) in the import settings by choosing ‘More options’ at the bottom-left of the import window.\n\n*\n\n*How to change photo import settings in Windows 8\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Copying over the time machine backups folder, \"backups.backupdb\" to a new drive results in \"V100 Spotlight\" permissions issues I am trying to copy over the time machine backups folder, \"backups.backupdb\" to a new drive but it keeps giving me errors like \"V100 Spotlight\" permissions issues. \nIf I changed the permissions of the entire backups folder, would it result in corruption? Thanks\n\nA: Please don’t tamper with the permissions of your Time Machine backup as this could indeed get you into trouble.\nOne of the problems you have trying to copy your Time Machine backup is the fact that Time Machine uses a feature called “hard links” which lets a single file show up in different folders multiple times. I. e., the file (precisely: its inode) is stored only once but it can have an arbitrary number of associated directory entries. If you copied these files using a tool unaware of hard links you would probably create unnecessary duplicates of these hard-linked files.\nYou should use Disk Utility (found in /Applications/Utilities) to clone the whole backup partition to the new drive or partition. Doing so will get you around the hard link problem as a block-level copy will be made instead of a file-level copy.\n", "Q: System Preferences constantly jumps to Keyboard screen Whenever I open System Preferences directly to one of the subscreens (e.g. Network or Bluetooth), that screen appears for a split second, then Sys Prefs immediately jumps to the Keyboard screen.  I have to Search and select the screen I want again before it will \"stick.\"\nAlso, if go to another prefs screen, then click away from it to another app, Sys Prefs again consistently jumps to the keyboard screen.\nEven after switching to another tab under Keyboard (Text, Shortcuts, etc.), clicking away will again jump back to the first tab (Keyboard -> Keyboard).\nHappens in Sierra but also happened in El Capitan.\nThis makes it pretty hard to do some tasks and is extremely annoying.  Haven't found any solutions online - ideas?\n\nA: Since this issue isn't present when you create a new user account, I suggest you also test whether this behaviour is replicated in Safe Mode.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your MacBook Pro into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. is the issue still present when accessing System Preferences)\n\n*Now exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Once logged in again, test to see whether the behaviour continues\n\n\nIf the problem is not present during Safe Mode and still remains when you log back in normally, it's time to investigate login items, fonts, and kernel extensions. \nInvestigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions\nLet's start with Login Items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup normally\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Take a note of your Login Items \n\n*Now remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the - button below\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n\nNow your Mac will boot up without those login items loading. Test this and see if the problem persists: \n\n\n*\n\n*If the problem goes away you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved.\n\n*If the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:\n\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\nAfter making these changes, use your Mac long enough to see what difference, if any, they make. This is basically a troubleshooting step to help narrow down the possible cause of your problem, so let me know how you go.\n\nA: There will be some debugging involved here.\nThe following 2 facts give the suggestion that the problem is located in your ~/Library/Preferences folder, and is likely a .plist file.\n\n\n*\n\n*The problem migrated from El Capitan to Sierra\n\n*The problem is connected to your user profile\n\n\nYou might try to move the ~/Library/Preferences elsewhere. It is likely this will solve your problem, but this will give lots of new annoyance as well (preferences from any app will be gone). You want to search for the culprit .plist file.\nI would start doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open ~/Library/Preferences, press cmd2 (list view) and order by date modified.\n\n*Then I would change some keyboard settings and simultaneously look at the recently modified plist files\n\n*You will notice that ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist changes, among some other files.\n\n\nI would then move these .plist files to the desktop, log out and log back in.\n", "Q: iCloud breach and what to do following it I have reason to believe that my iCloud account was recently breached and whoever did it is trying to lock my devices. I am aware that this is done through Find my IPhone and that they have set it to lost mode. However, when I go to Find my IPhone and I view the details of my mac, it simply says locked 6 minutes ago without an option to un-lost mode it. Is there any way to fix this / am I doing something wrong or do I have to go to an apple store and prove I own the device and such?\nThanks all,\nJimmy\n\nA: You would only have to go into an Apple store and prove ownership if your device is \"bricked\" after iOS/macOS is erased (meaning you cannot login to it due to forgotten password and/or Apple ID email address). When iCloud.com says the device is \"locked\" it does not mean \"bricked,\" it simply means the screen is locked, like with your pin.   \nIt sounds like all you need to do is enable 2-Factor authentication in your Apple ID/iCloud account, plus change your password. This will prevent whomever \"breached\" the account from logging in again.

Unbelievable 6 hours later, the installation was stuck and I turned my MacBook off. \nPressing the power button + Commandcommand R gives me this message:\n\nI tried everything, changing my WiFi authentication type from WEP to WPA/WPA2, all boot shortcuts, resetting SMC/NVRAM.\nPressing power + CommandOption shows me the following:\n\nClicking the \"...\" button lets me manually input the WiFi SSID and password, but it hangs forever in the loading indicator.\nI don't have another Mac to make a bootable USB stick and reinstall the OS, only Windows.\n\nA: I had to reinstall macOS using a USB stick. Probably the recovery partition data was corrupted and my WiFi network wasn't compatible at all for some reason.\n", "Q: Sharing folder or adding user to folder permissions using Finder's Get Info not possible I used to be able to add (or remove) users to this folder via Finder's Get Info. Today I noticed I was not able to do that anymore:\n\nWhen I select the Lock icon in the lower right hand corner and enter an administrator's credentials, the [+] icon in Get Info stayed disabled.\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nA: /* Posting this here in case someone else encounters a similar issue. */\nThis happened on a volume on an external drive.

I don't know why it mounted as read-only, but remember not seeing it at first among the volumes in Finder. So I did Shift+Command+G and entered the volume path before:\n\nThe volume mounted, but seemingly only as read-only.\nUnmounting and re-mounting it again solved the problem above.\n", "Q: Perl RegEx in Mac terminal: grep -p \"^([^\\t]*\\t){2}mypattern\\t\" textfile.txt doesn't work I am a beginner of using programming commands. \nWhy {2} is not functional after ([^\\t]*\\t) in macOS terminal?\nIs there any website providing Perl RegEx which works in mac? Thanks!\n\nA: RegExPlanet offer a Regular Expression Test Page for Perl. This page works with Safari on macOS 10.12.\nYou may find that grep included with macOS does not include all the functionality you want. If so, try installing grep from Homebrew or MacPorts.\n\nA: bsd grep does not use perl regular expressions. Please read man grep and note what the -p option does. Again, man 7 re_format explains how regex works in macOS with tools such as grep and sed.\nIn your regular expression the character \\t is not interpreted as the tab control character. So you will need to type the literal tab character ( control + v, tab ) instead -\ngrep -E '^([^   ]*      ){2}mypattern ' FILE\n\nor you can use ansi-c quoting (Words of the form $'string' are treated specially. The word expands to string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard.) -\ngrep -E $'^([^\\t]*\\t){2}mypattern\\t' FILE\n\nYou can also use perl directly -\nperl -ne  'print if /^([^\\t]*\\t){2}mypattern\\t/' FILE\n\n", "Q: Will Siri work with 3rd party apps after update from iOS 9 to 10?

Are there any changes in Siri features in iPhone 6s to iPhone 7? I want to work with 3rd party applications using Siri in iPhone 6s. Is it possible?\n\nA: SiriKit, or third-party integration with Siri, is available on any device compatible with iOS 10. According to Wikipedia: \n\nSiri is compatible with third-party app-specific requests, such as starting workouts apps, sending IMs, requesting the Lyft or Uber apps or to use payment functions.\n\nNote that not all apps utilise SiriKit, and only those that do will work with Siri.\n\nA: Yes, iOS 10 is backward capable with iOS so everything should work the same.\nThis year they even added full automatic migration and conversion of iOS 9 to iOS 10 code so apps should be updated in no time.\nApple support Iphones Generation 5 and upwards, but bare in mind Generation 8 is coming soon and thus support for Iphone 5 might phase out.\nStill Gen 6 should be relevant at least two years to come.\nPlease correct me if I'm misinformed\n", "Q: iPhone 6 charges extremely slow after reaching around 70% it's now been a few weeks since my iPhone 6 started charging extremely slow after reaching 70% battery life. I am aware of what slow trickle charging is, and the issue I am having is not it. After reaching around 70% my iPhone charges by 1% every 25/30 minutes and even seems to slow down towards the 80/90%. In fact when I tried to charge it to 100% it took me the whole day. I tried every suggestion I could find on the internet, including restarting, resetting, and even erasing all content and settings and restoring the device (not using a backup). I am starting to think the battery has an issue, but just a few weeks ago I had zero issues related to my battery.\nThank you in advance\n\nA: It should take 4 hours to charge iOS devices with the official supplied adapter when the device is idle or powered off. Healthy batteries should reach 80% in two hours. Then two more hours for the last 20%. \nIf yours plateaus sooner, it’s either due to power drain of things running while it charges or a sign that the charger or battery is out of specifications. \n\nA: Using a charger with less power than the original charger might not have enough power to sustain trickle charge (ie. it trickle charge with lower W).\nAn other solution I found on my Android device was changing the cable. \nSmart chargers use dual lanes. One for charging and one for communication.\nIf the communication is broken the charger wont be able to tell when to start or stop fast charging your phone and will \"play it safe\" by lowering the V.\nI'm not sure if the dual line communication actually have dual lines or if it somehow switches between communication and charging, but when you buy a new cable you can choose one without or one with fast/quick-charging.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro crashes intermittently My Mid-2014 15\" MBP has been randomly crashing and I haven't been able to identify a pattern to the crashes. \nHere's a log right after a crash and automatic restart:\nAnonymous UUID:       D3129405-6FEF-9C3C-46B9-EE344C1D6251\n\nWed Aug 30 09:41:25 2017\n\n*** Panic Report ***\npanic(cpu 7 caller 0xffffff801d96b46f): initproc exited  -- exit reason namespace 2 subcode 0xa description: none\n\nuuid info:\n 0x1043fe000    uuid = <322c06b7-8878-311d-888c-c8fd2ca96ff3>\n 0x1033bb000    uuid = <0ac314b8-c89c-3912-8bb7-e3f92c847169>\n\nThread 3 crashed\n\nRAX: 0x00000001033bb000, RBX: 0x00007fffba03e108, RCX: 0x00007fffba03e108, RDX: 0x000000010443d978\nRSP: 0x0000700005d66f30, RBP: 0x0000700005d66f30, RSI: 0x000000000000018e, RDI: 0x0000000104440b18\nR8:  0x00007fffba03e139, R9:  0x0000700005d67340, R10: 0x0000000000000000, R11: 0x00000001033ff188\nR12: 0x0000000104440b18, R13: 0x0000000000000000, R14: 0x000000000000018e, R15: 0x000000010443d978\nRFL: 0x0000000000010202, RIP: 0x0000000104411fd4, CS:  0x000000000000002b, SS:  0x0000000000000023\n\nThread 0: 0xffffff803de054e8\n    0x00007fffba169386\n      Could not read LR from frame at 0x0000700005bdeca8\n\nThread 1: 0xffffff803de02260\n    0x00007fffba1711e6\n    0x00007fffba01a24f\n    0x0000000000000000\n\nThread 2: 0xffffff804305c288\n    0x00007fffba1726ae\n    0x00007fffba021a16\n    0x00007fffba017a6c\n    0x00007fffba00f13b\n    0x00007fffba0227db\n    0x00007fffba015306\n    0x00007fffba00e6b5\n    0x00007fffba00e48c\n    0x00007fffba25b5a2\n    0x00007fffba25b07d\n    0x0000000000000000\n\nThread 3: 0xffffff804305b958\n    0x0000000104411fd4\n    0x000000010441af8b\n    0x000000010440286d\n    0x00007fffba03e282\n    0x00000001033ff188\n    0x00000001033ebe09\n    0x00007fffba00c8fc\n    0x00007fffba021a16\n    0x00007fffba017a6c\n    0x00007fffba00f13b\n    0x00007fffba0227db\n    0x00007fffba015306\n    0x00007fffba02324c\n    0x00007fffba02627a\n    0x00007fffba25b47b\n    0x00007fffba25b07d\n    0x0000000103411000\n\nThread 4: 0xffffff80605d4078\n    0x00007fffba25b070\n\nThread 5: 0xffffff806318f498\n    0x00007fffba251bc1\n    0x00007fffba251b59\n    0x00000001033e9590\n    0x00007fffba021486\n    0x00007fffba00c8fc\n    0x00007fffba0229a0\n    0x00007fffba015306\n    0x00007fffba00e6b5\n    0x00007fffba00e48c\n    0x00007fffba25b5a2\n    0x00007fffba25b07d\n    0x0000000000000000\n\n\nMac OS version:\n16G29\n\nKernel version:\nDarwin Kernel Version 16.7.0: Thu Jun 15 17:36:27 PDT 2017; root:xnu-3789.70.16~2/RELEASE_X86_64\nKernel UUID: D3314D98-5D40-3CD8-98A4-F1DD46C20E03\nSystem model name: MacBookPro11,2 (Mac-3CBD00234E554E41)\nRoot disk errors: \"Could not recover SATA HDD after 5 attempts.

Is there anything else I can do myself before heading to an Apple Store? (The MBP is out of warranty)\n\nA: What you are experiencing is called a “kernel panic”.\nThe line Root disk errors: \"Could not recover SATA HDD after 5 attempts. Terminating.\"is a clear indication of your MacBook having an issue with the built-in SSD. Are you sure you had a look at the results of Disk First Aid, preferably run from the Recovery HD? As an alternative, you might want to boot into single-user mode (pressing cmd-S upon start) and use fsck to test the drive:\nfsck -f\n\nUse the reboot command once fsck has finished.\nHas the MBP ever been opened or dropped? In that case, the SSD may just sit improperly in its slot which would explain the intermittent nature of the symptom. Unlikely but not impossible.\n\nA: Digging up this old question to add an answer, as it might help someone in the future. \nWhat did the trick was to take the MacBook to a 3rd-party repair shop, where they took the internals apart and cleaned the SSD connection to the motherboard. After that I’ve been using the laptop for the past 2 months with not a single freeze .\nHowever, the above begs the question how did the SSD connection get dirty? But let’s leave it at that.\n", "Q: Empty folders with mangled names being put in my user directory I have hundreds of empty folders with mangled names being put in my user folder. I have tried not showing hidden folders but I still have the problem. I can delete them and they come back on reboot. Running Sierra, and I just re-installed it this morning and still have the problem.  \n\n\nA: That is one of the strangest things I have ever seen and my introduction to Macintosh was with System 4 on a 512K Mac.\nThere could be a number of things causing that. A runaway/damaged process running in the background seems the most likely, but I suppose there could also be some disk corruption.\nI would boot the system into recovery mode and run a repair on the startup volume using disk utility. If it finds no issue then it is more likely that it is a runaway/damaged process of some sort.\nBooting into safe Mode (Hold Shift while starting up the Mac) will disable 3rd party applications that run at startup and if the problem goes away in safe mode it is something that was installed on the Mac that is now damaged. uninstalling the application, turning off any login items (system preferences > Users & Groups > [your user] > login items) and looking for other things that run at startup are a place to start.\nIf it is still happening it is likely an issue with macOS. In that case you could try downloading and installing the latest combo update, the latest for Sierra is here.\nFailing that I would reinstall macOS right over top of what you already have. While that shouldn't delete any data I would make sure you have a good backup first.\n", "Q: Can iPhone autofill emails in contacts based on pattern? I have just filled my work phone with name and phone number to all at work.\nCan I somehow make it autofill the email with a pattern?  \n<First name>.<last name>@<company>.se\n\nIs that possible with some app or setting or something?\nIt's quite daunting to type all emails when they are all following a pattern that is already in the contacts list.\n\nA: I found a way to make it happen.\nThere may be easier ways to do it but this is what I found.\nI think this solution will work well with iPhone, Android and Windows phones as it's not an app.  \nOur contacts sync with our mail office365 OWA.\nAnd in Office 365 you can export contacts as a CSV file.  \nOnce you have the CSV you can open it with Excel and create a formula to build the email.\nSince I'm swedish I need to remove ÅÄÖ and make them AO I did that with substitute().\nExample:  \n=Substitute(Substitute(Substitute(A2;\"Å\";\"A\");\"Å\";\"A\");\"Ö\";\"O\")\n\nThe above formula can change names with ÅÄÖ, for example Åsa becomes Asa.\nIf you are Spanish you may need to replace for example ñ to n.  \nBecause the layout of a CSV can be different depending on mail client and you may have a different language Excel installed there is no point in typing out the full formula.  \nBut if the above formula is for first name you can add on last name like this:  \n=Substitute(Substitute(Substitute(A2;\"Å\";\"A\");\"Å\";\"A\");\"Ö\";\"O\")&\".\"&Substitute(Substitute(Substitute(B2;\"Å\";\"A\");\"Å\";\"A\");\"Ö\";\"O\")\n\nIf column A is first name and B is last name.\nAlso usually capital letters are \"unwanted\" in emails, you can use function Lower() to make capital => lowercase letters.  \nIt worked very well at last and I could easily upload the edited contacts CSV and it was synced to my phone.\n", "Q: Video stuttering in Google Chrome with hardware acceleration enabled Google Chrome comes by default with Hardware Acceleration enabled. This setting can be changed from the advanced settings.\nI'm experiencing a very frustrating problem where most video content on Google Chrome experiences visual stutters that last up to 6 seconds. Moving the mouse seems to unfreeze the video, but it will otherwise not unfreeze until after a few seconds, only to freeze again shortly thereafter.\nDisabling Hardware Acceleration eliminates the stutter. As a side-effect, all web content becomes slower and more CPU-intensive, especially pages that make use of CSS visual effects. As such, it's not viable to keep using the software without Hardware Acceleration.\nI'm experiencing this problem only when using Google Chrome and only when doing so on my 2017 15\" MBP. The computer is upgraded to the highest-tier hardware, so I don't suspect it's a question of underpowered hardware.\nMy 2012 non-retina 15\" MBP also does not display this issue. One of the main differences is that I have two users logged into the MacBook at the same time, one being my personal and the other my work account. I often switch between these. This question has a similar background but no solution.\nThe problem also doesn't appear to be constant. Sometimes videos will play without stutter. This might be related to the automatic graphic switching. At the moment my graphics card is set to High-Performance and I can see no stuttering. I never noticed any stuttering when I tried playing the same content on Safari after experiencing stutter in Chrome.\nIs there a solution to the stuttering?\nHardware/Software details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Chrome: Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)\n\n*OS: macOS Sierra: 10.12.6 (16G29)\n\n*Model: MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)\n\n*Processor: 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*Memory: 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3\n\n*Graphics: Radeon Pro 560 4096 MB, Intel HD Graphics 630 1536 MB\n\n*External Display: LG 34UC98, connected via Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter and Thunderbolt 2 cable. Note the issue appears on both internal and external display.\n\n\nA: I had same problem and the solution is go to System Preferences > Keyboard and uncheck turn keyboard backlight off. This will make Chrome work smoothly .\n\nA: Video will be lagging and stuttering in GC if you've got many GC plugins, use hardware acceleration option (nowadays this option still has many bugs), got outdated graphics card drivers, etc.\nTo fix lagging/stuttering video, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable \"Use hardware acceleration\"\n\n*Browse in \"Incognito Mode\"\n\n*Delete cached files and cookies via \"Clear Browsing Data...\"\n\n*Disable unused plugins under chrome://plugins\n\n*Disable all extensions under chrome://extensions\n\n*Update graphics card drivers (use the latest update in macOS)\n\n*Use the default theme in Chrome\n\n*Reset your browser settings\n\n\nAlso, try Chrome Canary to see if the issue still exists there. And look at this page as well.\n\nA: Try using the resolution that is default for the display.\nI had the same issue with HW acceleration, with the latest Chrome and Mac OS updates.

It seems to me like you want a file saved in that Web Clips folder that just contains what you had selected in Safari with the link, title, and date. I would write this as an HTM file rather than a text file, and here's the code I used with inline comments.\nset myFolder to ((path to users folder) as text) & \"Web:Documents:Web Text Clips:\"\nset myFile to myFolder & \"Web_Text_Clips.htm\"\n\ntell application \"Safari\"\nset theLongDate to current date\nset theWindowName to the name of the front window\nset selectedText to (do JavaScript \"(''+getSelection())\" in document 1) --use javascript to get what part of the page is selected\nset theURL to the URL of the front document\nend tell\n\nset myFolder to POSIX path of (myFolder as alias) --convert to posix path for use in the command line\nset myFile to quoted form of (myFolder & myFile) --append the file name to the end of the file path\ndo shell script \"touch \" & myFile --create the htm file\n\n--Add content to the HTM document\nnewHTM(myFile) --Add the HTM doctype and opening tags.\naddElement(\"p\", \"--------\", myFile) --\"p\" is the htm tag for a paragraph, and we want this to be it's own paragraph. \naddElement(\"p\", \"From: <a href=\" & theURL & \">\" & theURL & \"</a>\", myFile) --a bit more complex, adding a paragraph with a link (<a> is the link tag)\naddElement(\"p\", \"Page Title: \" & theWindowName, myFile) --Adding a paragraph for the Page Title\naddElement(\"p\", \"Date: \" & theLongDate, myFile) --Adding a paragraph for the Date line.\ncloseHTM(myFile) --Add the closing HTML tags.\n\n------------HANDLERS------------\non newHTM(filePath)\n    do shell script \"printf '<!doctype html>\\n<html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n<head>\\n\\t<title>Web Clips</title>\\n\\n</head>\\n\\n<body>\\n\\t' > \" & filePath\nend newHTM\n\non closeHTM(filePath)\n    do shell script \"printf '\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>' >> \" & filePath\nend closeHTM\n\non addElement(elem, htm, filePath)\n    set htm to \"\\t\\t<\" & elem & \">\" & htm & \"</\" & elem & \">\\n\"\n    do shell script \"printf '\" & htm & \"' >> \" & filePath\nend addElement\n\nThis script preserves the link by using HTML to \"embed\" the link. It will open in your default browser. It appeared to me, from your script, that this file only contains the latest web clipping, so that's how I wrote it. If, however, you want this file to contain a list of web clippings, the script would need to be edited. Either way, I hope this gives you a good start.

While learning bash scripting by going through a Beginner's Guide, I tried writing some lines of code in the .sh file, created in TextEdit on macOS Yosemite and running it using the command bash \\path\\to\\script\\file\\example_script.sh in bash Terminal.\nLine of code that I first tested:\necho “The path to my home directory is: $HOME”\n\nStandard output (stdout) in Terminal:\n“The path to my home directory is: ??\n\ninstead of getting:\nThe path to my home directory is: /Users/Ri$hi\n\n\nThen, I got to know about the curious case of \"smart quotes\" from a stackexchange, and played with some funny combos, like below:\nLine of code that I tested later:\nScenario 1:\necho “The path to my home directory is: $HOME (foo) bar”\n\nstdout:\n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nScenario 2:\necho \"The path to my home directory is: $HOME (foo) bar\"\n\nstdout:\nThe path to my home directory is: /Users/Ri$hi (foo) bar\n\nScenario 3:\necho “The path to my home directory is: $HOME” “(foo)” “bar”\n\nstdout:\n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nScenario 4:\necho \"The path to my home directory is: $HOME\" “(foo)” “bar”\n\nstdout:\n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nScenario 5:\necho “The path to my home directory is: $HOME” \"(foo)\" “bar”\n\nstdout:\n“The path to my home directory is: ?? (foo) “bar”\n\nSo, I thought why not find out the reason interactively on this forum.\nNOTE: Terminal always displays standard double quote \" when Shift+\" is pressed, but it allows displaying smart double quotes “ ”through ⌘+C, ⌘+V operation.\n\nA: There are two things going on here: First, bash recognizes the plain ASCII double-quote, \" (character code 0x22) as a double-quote; it does not recognize the fancy unicode left double-quote, “ (unicode U+201C, UTF-8 encoding 0xe2809c) and the corresponding right double-quote, ” (unicode U+201D, UTF-8 encoding 0xe2809d) as anything other than random sequences of bytes (or maybe as random characters, if it's using a UTF-8 locale). This is the fundamental thing to realize: as far as bash is concerned, “ and ” are not actually quotes, they're just things that happen to look like a quotes when they're printed out.\nThe second complication is that the unicode double-quotes are multibyte characters, so if bash isn't in a UTF-8 locale it may treat some of the bytes differently than others(!)\nTo see the effect of the first thing, try replacing each occurrence of a double-quote with the string WIBBLE -- another arbitrary sequence that has no special meaning to the shell:\n$ echo \"The path to my home directory is: $HOME bar\"\nThe path to my home directory is: /Users/gordon bar\n$ echo “The path to my home directory is: $HOME bar”\n“The path to my home directory is: /Users/gordon bar”\n$ echo WIBBLEThe path to my home directory is: $HOME barWIBBLE\nWIBBLEThe path to my home directory is: /Users/gordon barWIBBLE\n\nIn the first command (with ASCII double-quotes), the quotes are parsed and removed by bash before the argument(s) are passed to the echo command, and hence not printed. In the second and third (with fancy double-quotes and WIBBLE in place of plain quotes), they're just treated as part of the strings to be passed to echo, so echo prints them as part of its output.\n$ echo \"The path to my home directory is: $HOME (foo) bar\"\nThe path to my home directory is: /Users/gordon (foo) bar\n$ echo “The path to my home directory is: $HOME (foo) bar”\n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n$ echo WIBBLEThe path to my home directory is: $HOME (foo) barWIBBLE\n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nIn the second and third commands (with fancy double-quotes and WIBBLE), bash sees parentheses in a non-quoted portion of the command (remember: as far as bash is concerned, fancy quotes are not actually quotes), in a place where they aren't allowed by shell syntax, and therefore complains.\n$ echo “The path to my home directory is: $HOME”\n“The path to my home directory is: ??\n$ echo WIBBLEThe path to my home directory is: $HOMEWIBBLE\nWIBBLEThe path to my home directory is:\n\nHere, something weirder is happening. In the second command, it's looking for a variable named HOMEWIBBLE, not finding it, so replacing it with blank. In the case of the first one, with the fancy double-quotes, it looks to me like it's treating each byte of the UTF-8 encoding of ” as a separate character, treating the first as part of the variable name (again causing the variable not to be found), and then just passing the second and third bytes through, giving an invalid UTF-8 character, which gets printed as ??. Using a hex dump to get a better idea what's going on gives this:\n$ echo “$HOME”\n“??\n$ echo “$HOME” | xxd -g1\n00000000: e2 80 9c 80 9d 0a                                ......\n\nNote that the first “ goes through fine, and shows up in the hex dump as e2 80 9c (the expected UTF-8 encoded fancy double-quote), but after that is just 80 9d -- the first e2 of the second fancy quote got eaten somehow! (BTW, the 0a at the end is a linefeed, marking the end of the output.) To see what's happening, let me define a shell variable as HOME+the first byte of the encoding of ”, and watch what happens:\n$ eval $'HOME\\xe2=foo'\n$ echo “$HOME”\n“foo??\n$ echo “$HOME” | xxd -g1\n00000000: e2 80 9c 66 6f 6f 80 9d 0a                       ...foo...\n\n...So there's what's going on: it's treating the first byte of the double-quote's encoding as part of the variable name, substituting it (if defined), and then just passing through the orphaned second and third bytes, leaving invalid UTF-8. I'm not sure if this is a bash bug, oddity of its parsing, or what.\nAnyway, the details are rather messy, but the takeaway should be clear: don't use fancy quotes in your shell scripts; they won't work right. And the same applies to fancy single-quotes and other unicode punctuation marks.\n", "Q: How to view certificates from my keychain on iOS?

I've read a few posts on here and the general gist of what I'm reading is that it's possible to hook up a 4K display via HDMI running at 3840 x 2160 @ 30 Hz. My first question is if this would still apply when I keep the 27 inch iMac as a second external display. Does anyone have experience with this? It's working fine with my current setup, but the 23 inch display is only running at a 1920x1080 resolution.\nUpdate 9/6\nSo I decided to give it a shot and went for a Samsung U32H850UMN display. I'm connecting it to the HDMI port of my Macbook and at the same time the iMac is still connected in TDM using the thunderbolt port. The Samsung display is running at 3840 x 2160 @ 30 Hz (as expected). The Macbook is running in clamshell mode. I'll keep an eye on the Macbook's temperature to make sure it doesn't get too hot. If it does I will just switch to just the Samsung monitor as my main display.\n\nA: Officially these MBPs can support up to one HDMI display (at 1920x1080 pixels) while simultaneously connected to a Thunderbolt display (at 2560x1600 pixels), OR being connected to two Thunderbolt displays (both at 2560x1600 pixels).\nHowever, unofficially you can exceed this. I'm not aware of anyone who has done exactly what you're wanting to do, but I have come across the following scenarios with other users:\n\n\n*\n\n*connecting two 27\" Thunderbolt displays each at 2560x1600 pixels while also using the built-in display, with a 23% increase in the MBP's fan speed, but with no long-term damage/problems.\n\n*connecting three external displays while in clamshell mode. However, this can result in the MBP's fans spinning at more than double their usual speed when watching videos etc. Not something I would recommend.\n\n*using a single Thunderbolt display at higher resolutions (e.g. 3440x1440) with the MBP in clamshell mode without any problems whatsoever.\n\n*using two 27\" iMacs in Target Display Mode (one using a Thunderbolt connection and the other a Thunderbolt/DisplayPort connection) without any problems (both in and out of clamshell mode).\n\n*using a single Thunderbolt display at higher resolutions (e.g. 3440x1440) while also using the built-in display. This seems to work okay, although the fans will spin about 30% faster. This is probably the limit of how much I'd recommend pushing things.\n\n\nIt's not clear from your question whether you were wanting to use the MBP in clamshell mode, but the info above may give you enough to help you decide whether what you want to do is worth the risk.\n", "Q: Moving mail to folder removes it from mail account I have two aliases set up in my Gmail account and on my Mac Mail.app I set up a rule for each alias that if an email is \"to 'Alias A'\", move it to folder \"Alias A Folder\" - respectively for \"Alias B\".\nThe issue is that by creating this rule, it works perfectly on the Mail.app on my Mac and it sorts them well, but they are moved out of my Gmail account, so I cannot read those emails on my phone nor on the gmail.com interface.\nI understand that I could just create a rule to \"copy\" the mails to \"Alias X Folder\", but then my personal Gmail account would get cluttered with mail from the aliases.\nIs there any workaround or scenario for which I can organize my mails in a better way across my devices?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: It seems you created a local folder (On your Mac).

Add in a 2.5\" SSD for my system and that's a total of six drives.\nCurrently several of these drives are in their own enclosures. But in order to maximize read and write speeds (especially since the 2009 Mac Pro doesn't have any USB 3 ports) I was thinking of putting all of these drives in the Mac Pro itself: four in the drive bays and then two in the optical drive bays.\nHowever, I'm worried that my old Mac Pro may not properly handle dissipating the heat generated by all five hard drives in addition to heat from the CPU and motherboard. I haven't ever replaced any of its fans. I'm also curious if there are other reasons making all of these drives internal might shorten their life.\nIs this a reasonable idea? What are the issues that I should be aware of so I can keep everything running smoothly?\n\nA: Purely anecdotally - I've been running 4 HDs in Mac Pros since 2008 with no issues - but never tried 5.\nCurrently I've a 4,1 with 4 HDs & a boot SSD in the optical bay. I still have the optical in the other bay.\nI find that normally the CPU fans run a little fast at stock settings, so I use iStat Menus to lift the Intake fan speed from its nominal 600 to 1000 rpm & that settles everything down.\nPure speculation, but that's because I'm running 2x3.46Ghz Westmere Xeons instead of the original Nehalems, so ymmv.\nThe only thing I'd beware of would be to give it enough room to breathe, plenty of exhaust space. I find my older 3,1 whilst perfectly capable of keeping its own temperatures down, really throws a lot of heat into the room, so I wouldn't ever put it in an enclosed space.\nPotentially, with an HD in the optical bay, you might want to lift the Power Supply fan speed, as the HD will be pushing more heat than the opticals ever would & I'm not sure the system would automatically compensate for that. \n", "Q: Windows 10 via Bootcamp: \"Setup was unable to use the existing system partition...\" I'm running macOS Sierra on an early 2015 MacBook Pro with a 500 GB SSD. \nI've been trying to get Windows 10 installed via Bootcamp by following this guide: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204990\nI've allocated 80GB of space via the Bootcamp Assistant. \nI'm getting stuck at the following error:\n\"Setup was unable to use the existing system partition because it does not contain the required free space\"\nI can go larger, but am not confident that would resolve the issue (I've done some searching and others report an issue with 100GB) and I didn't really want to give Windows that much space.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: It turns out the error is misleading. I was able to resolve the issue and successfully complete installation by clearing space on the \"EFI Partition\" by following this guide: Unable to install Windows 8.1 using Bootcamp, system volume doesn't contain required free space?\n", "Q: Theres a drastic color change in my screen. (it's a drastic change in the rectangle) \nIt stays and it goes. Sometimes I have to push lightly down on the screen to get rid of it. I tried to take a screenshot of it but it seems as if the glitch/ whatever it is, is internal. \nWhat can I do to try and fix this error??\n\nA: Pressure on the display that changes the display contents indicates physical failure of the delicate connectors where the glass meets the metal wires running to the controller. \nI would have an Apple certified tech let you know if it’s safe and get a quote to fix it. Unless there’s damage elsewhere internally, that sort of failure doesn’t damage other parts or represent a shock / fire risk vast majority of the time so you could opt to not repair it if you don’t feel the cost or time out of service matter to you. \nThis likely won’t get better or fix itself, though. \n", "Q: How to move a file to another drive via drag & drop without pressing Cmd How can I configure macOS' Finder in a way that I can move (not copy) files via drag & drop to another drive without pressing Cmd?\nI'm transferring files to a network storage on a regular basis and pressing Cmd all the time is a bit tedious.\n\nA: This is not possible when using drag and drop between drives as of macOS 10.12.x Sierra.\nThere is also no known method to change this behavior.\n\nAlternative\nInstead you may use these keyboard shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*CommandC to copy the items in Finder\n\n*CommandOptionV to move the items without copying.\n\n", "Q: iOS Calendar: What is the meaning of Time Zone Override?

It doesn't seem that macOS makes space when needed, as when I try creating a large file with mkfile or try to copy a bigger file through the Finder it fails saying there's no space left.\nI know that if I'm sure all files are syncronized I can switch iCloud Drive off and back on to free up space, but is this really the official and/or best way to free up space after syncing is finished?\nI assume a \"Free up space\" button would be an obvious addition to the UI? What's the best way to remove files that are already synced?\nAfter years, iCloud still seems like a half-baked product to me.\n\nA: It works as intended, I’m afraid. “Your Mac keeps all of your recent files on your computer, but keeps your older ones only in iCloud, ready for you to download when you need them again”, Apple says. So as long as you still have enough free space on your hard disk the files will stay there.\nPlease see Apple’s article Free up storage space on your Mac for tips on how to free up more space on the Mac using iCloud.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro USB port won't work I am using a Macbook Pro running Sierra 10.12.6. All of sudden when I went to the studio to record an artist, I found that one of the USB ports (one next to the SD card slot) won't recognize any of the devices that I plug-in. While recording I need to use both the USB ports as I need one for the iLok and another one for my audio interface (Roland Quad Capture).\nAs my studio is in a basement, it get's really humid there. Initially I thought that the port has died because of the humid conditions as I have faced a similar issue with my MSI dragon series gaming laptop (which again I use for recording and music production) where some of the keys on the builtin keyboard won't respond after I accidentally left my laptop in the studio for a couple days.\nI still wanted to be sure so I researched online and a lot of people had exactly the same issue and resetting NVRAM or SMC fixed it for them. I was really excited to try these solutions. When I did, unfortunately, none of them worked for me. Though, I noticed something weird.\nWeirdness\nThe iLok dongle has a tiny blue led light that is turned on when you insert it into a USB port. When I try to use the iLok in the other USB port it works absolutely fine, but when I insert it into the USB port in question, the light never turns on.\nAfter resetting the SMC, when I plug the iLok dongle into the faulty port, The light comes on but it keeps blinking. It is not a continuous light like when you insert it into a working port.\nwhen I take out the dongle and insert it back again, the light is gone.\nYet another weird thing is that when I use the port in question to charge my iPhone, the charging part works but the phone does not show up in iTunes.\nNOTE:\nAlso, I would like to bring to your notice that for some reason I feel that resetting the NVRAM has caused this issue. I tried resetting the NVRAM before this issue as my screen saver/login screen had recently started hanging real bad. I read at the Apple forums that resetting the NVRAM was the solution so I did it. It did not solve the screen saver issue. After this, I drove to my studio where I had to record with an artist, and this is when I came to know about the faulty port. I recorded with the same artist last week and both the ports were working fine. Since the last recording, I haven't really used the USB port, so I am not sure whether this happened within this week (I have not installed anything within this week though) or after resetting the NVRAM.\nDevices I tested\nI tried testing the port with multiple devices.

There's no NVRAM setting or SMC control that handles power to the USB (directly).\nThe \"light\" that you are seeing on your USB device doesn't mean it's connected and recognized by the computer.  It simply means it is receiving power on the +5V pin of the USB port.\n\nLooking at the pinouts of a USB 2.0 Port, we can see that there is a dedicated +5V for power (why your phone charges) and two  pins for Data (Data+/- for positive/negative voltage signals) and a ground.  Data isn't being transmitted (which is why your iTunes doesn't recognize your phone).\nWhat could the problem be?\n\n\n*\n\n*It could be a failed USB controller (SMSC USB25138)\n\n*Broken or corroded solder pads/joints on the USB ports or related components\n\n*Physically broken USB port\n\n\nAny/all of these would contribute to the weird behavior you are seeing.\n\nFrom iFixit.com, we can see that the board layout as follows:\n\nThe good news is that this can be fixed.  It's not a DIY type of repair, but there are shops that specialize in component level repairs.  Just do a search for \"MacBook Logic board repair\" (Rossman in NYC is really good - not affiliated, just a happy happy client) \nSince you indicated it was only one USB port, the chances are good it's just a bad connection with the physical port itself.

I am trying to edit the behavior of the media key \"<<\" on a macbook keyboard.\nThere is a way to map the \"rewind\" button to the \"short jump back\" function in vlc? How does mac os deal with media keys under the hood?\n\nA: Actually mapping any key in a specific application is built into macOS.\nsystem preferences > keyboard > shortcuts > App shortcut\nOnce you are there click the + and select VLC from the Application menu at the top, then type in the EXACT menu name. Exact is important it has to be capitalized correctly and if it has \"...\" at the end remember that is not three periods its an ellipsis which you get by pressing Option;. Then click in the Keyboard Shortcut field and tap the key you want to assign. In your case that would be F7.\nThis can generally be done for any Application that does not have a keyboard shortcut already assigned. If there is one already assigned you may have to remove that first.\n\nA: What didn't work\nI had the same need but was unable assign a shortcut to the \"<<\" media key using System Preferences. When I pressed the key at the Keyboard Shortcut input it didn't take, but instead rewound VLC. I was also unable to remap the \"rewind\" key using Karabiner Elements (13.5.0 on Big Sur) to something I could make a shortcut with.\nAlternative\nSince I was unable to use \"rewind\", instead I built up a solution which uses normal F7 (otherwise the \"<<\" media key), F8, and F9 function keys to trigger Step Backward, Play/Pause, and Step Forward. You can use other keys (see below).\nBackground\nAs described in this videolan forum thread VLC provides an AppleScript \"dictionary\" which can be used to automate it, including play to toggle play/plause, step backward N, and step forward N. Here is a simple example:\ntell application \"VLC\" to step backward 1\nAppleScript can be invoked in many ways on a Mac, including by making an app and assigning a keyboard shortcut to call the app as a Service.\nMy solution\nHowever, I was already using Hammerspoon for other shortcuts and it can call AppleScript directly.

On the 2017 MBP you have at least 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports.  This means you don't need to convert from TB to DP/mDP as the signal is already there.\nThe LED Cinema display uses an mDP interface and the Thunderbolt display requires a Thunderbolt connection.\nSo, all you need is a USB-C (Thunderbolt) to DisplayPort cable for the LED display, and a Thunderbolt 3 to 2 adapter you mentioned along with the Thunderbolt cable you already own (from the previous setup) for the Thunderbolt monitor.\n\nA: So Apple's TB3 adapter is only for data... only real use I found is when using the old computer in Target Disk Mode to transfer all data to the new computer. (Time Machine is not very good at computer migration)\nI have the exact same problem and after much search, came to this solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual-Link DIV to DisplayPort using Apple's connector\n\n*DisplayPort to USB-C using this connector Which is a  USB-C to Mini-DisplayPort and Charging Port Adapter {Amazon.com}\n\n\nKeep in mind that the Cinema display also needs a USB-A connection (I'm guessing to provide power to some internal circuit for link negotiation?), so you'll need a separate adapter from USB-C to USB-A.\nI'm also an amateur photographer and shoots with a Canon 5DsR, editing my photos using an AdobeRGB LG 4K display (10-bit color to support AdobeRGB). I've also tested the DisplayPort adapter on this display and it works flawlessly.\nOn a side note - reason why you'll need a separate adapter for USB-A instead of having the USB-A built-in to the DisplayPort adapter is that only way for USB-C to support DisplayPort data-rate is using Display Protocol, which turns a bi-directional USB connection (10Gbit/direction) to a uni-directional output port (20Gbit total). If you work out the math: 3840 * 2160 * 10-bit color per channel * 3 color channels (RGB) * 60 Hz = 15Gbit/s.\n\nA: Simple answer: Yes. At my last position, I used a 2017 USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 only MacBook Pro with a Cinema Display (Thunderbolt 3 to miniDisplayPort adapter) and a Thunderbolt Display (Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter).\nIt was neither ideal nor elegant, but it worked.\n", "Q: iMac notified me when call comes in on iPhone.

I know the Apple site says this regarding the number of displays:\n\n\n*\n\n*Up to two displays with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\n\n*Up to four displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at millions of colors\n\n*Up to four displays with 3840-by-2160 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\n\n\nBut I'm trying to find the cleanest solution for connecting this thing to 3 monitors without having a bunch of wires connected. I also know very little about the power restrictions and the connectivity of how the Thunderbolt ports are setup. Are they effectively on the same bus? Is connecting to one the same as connecting to all? Are they (hardware-wise) divided between the two sides they're on?\nI'm also unable to find any docks that support 3 displays, only 2.\nIdeally, I'd like to be able to plug in a single dock, and have that dock power 3 displays. I'd like to know if it's possible, and if so, what dock there is. If it's not possible, will just using two docks on the same side of the machine be okay?\n\nA: It's a matter of available bandwidth of the Thunderbolt port, not the dock itself.\nA Thunderbolt 3 port has enough display bandwidth to handle a single 5K @60H display or two 4K displays at 60HZ.  \nOn the 15\" MacBook Pro (2017), it has two Thunderbolt controllers, so you can now attach a second 5K display or two more 4K displays.  But because it's on a second controller, it will have to be on a different port.\nFrom Apple's Thunderbolt Page\n\nThunderbolt 3 provides twice the display bandwidth of Thunderbolt 2,\n  enabling iMac to support two 4K displays or one 5K display. And with\n  two Thunderbolt controllers in the 15-inch MacBook Pro, you can send\n  graphics to dual 5K displays for the perfect high-resolution photo and\n  video editing setup.\n\nThe dock can support 2 displays, because that's the maximum that can be supported by the port.  To get a 3rd and 4th display, you would have to use a different Thunderbolt port on the MBP.\nHowever, you could (theoretically - meaning I have never personally tested this) put a USB to DVI/DisplayPort/HDMI adapter on one of the USB ports of the dock and get a 3rd display, but I currently can't see how you would get 4K out of it. \n", "Q: Accessing photos on iPhone iCloud backup Is it possible to access photos from iPhone iCloud backups without loading them onto a iPhone? \nAfter losing my phone, I purchased a new iPhone with less memory.

I have almost 20K emails and I need to clean up my Gmail account, make separate folders and categorize them. But before that, I want to backup all the email database that I have in my Apple Mail. I am using the export function but it's taking too long and I am not a big fan of TIme Machine as it backs up all the other things as well along with your database folder consuming too much space, so I disabled it long time back. Is there any solution with which I can backup my Apple Mail Gmail account automatically at regular intervals to an external hard drive?\nLooking for real helpful answers. Thanks\n\nA: As you are thinking of backing up your Gmail account, there are multiple applications available online (paid) to backup Gmail Account as well as Apple Mail. One I found interesting was: http://www.mailbackupx.com/how-to-scenerios/how-to-backup-apple-mac-mail-mails-on-mac.html\nHowever, you can always set your Time Machine to backup only your mail folders as Apple Mail makes an automatic backup of all the incoming and offline emails as well. You will have to exclude all the other folders and set the Time Machine to Backup this folder only: /Users/username/Library/Mail and /Users/username/Library/Mail Downloads\nAlso, you can direct the storage location to an external storage in Time Machine only and your backup will happen automatically.\n\nA: Why not trim down time machine and exclude all the things you don’t want to back up? It is the free, supported, designed way to do precisely what you need. If you want to pay for another backup solution, super duper and carbon copy clones are the way to go. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://bombich.com/\n\n*http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\nAlso, before you spend any money or evaluate ongoing backup - do a one time export to a fast external SSD or wait a little longer for one clean export to Hard drive. Then you can clean up down to the thousand or two mails you really need / intend to keep. There might be no issues with export or time machine at that point. \n", "Q: pkgbuild productbuild requires admin privilege during pkg installation I am trying to build a Mac application using xcode for use in OS version 10.8 and above.

One has its WAN port connected to my modem, and the other as been configured to wirelessly extend the first, meaning none of the Ethernet ports on the back are connected. I plan to connect four devices to this second AirPort Extreme. I know I can use the three LAN ports on the back to connect devices, but can I use the WAN port?\n\nA: Yes.\nWhen an AirPort Extreme is configured to extend another AirPort Extreme wirelessly, the WAN port is not used for WAN, and this means it is automatically switched to be a LAN port, identical to the other three LAN ports already on the back of the unit. This was tested by myself with an Apple AirPort Extreme 802.11n 1st Generation, and this answer was posted with a computer which is connected to the WAN port of said router.\n", "Q: How can I check if my iCloud email address or Apple ID has been compromised? We have 8 Apple IDs made up of 4 iCloud email addresses and 4 other email addresses. Is there an Apple service or other way for me to check if any of these addresses have been hacked?\n\nA: There’s no 100% certain way to be sure that an Apple ID and/or iCloud email address has not been compromised.\nHowever, you can use an online service such as the Have I been pwned? site to conduct a search of your email addresses to check whether there’s any known breaches (e.g. the Linkedin and Adobe breaches a while back) that contained information relating to your email address. If a known breach involving your email address has occurred, this site can provide details of what data may have been breached. \nFor example, say I've had my email address registered with Adobe for five years, then by entering it into this site it will show that there was a breach of Adobe’s site in 2013 and that the compromised data included email addresses, usernames, passwords and password hints.\nNotify me function\nAnother feature of the Have I been pwned? site is that you can elect to be notified if at any future point your account is compromised. You can do that by registering your email address with the Notify me function.\nSearching entire domains\nIf you happen to have your own domain (or are responsible for one), you can also use the Domain Search function to search for any email addresses on that domain that have been compromised. \nHowever, this will require you to enter both the domain and an email address, as well as going through a quick process to verify you're responsible for the domain in question. Once you've done that you can choose to download a file containing the data.\nNOTE: I am not affiliated in any way with the Have I been pwned? site. However I have used it many times and can attest to the fact that all features mentioned here work well.\n\nIMPORTANT\nIf you have any reason to suspect that any of your Apple IDs have been compromised, I strongly recommend you change your password.\n", "Q: Is there a way to take videos on iOS, with music playing?

I would take your lumps and submit normal priority. The reviewers might see your second request and know it’s going to be easy to approve. Unless you are truly fixing something that puts the customer at risk, this next expedited request should really be for a big show stopper if you “ring the emergency help” bell again so soon.

Is there a way to upload them back from the car and onto my phone, rather than trying to track them all down again? A cursory sweep of Google/Apple did not even answers if this is possible, let alone how to do it. \nThanks. \n\nA: Unfortunately, it's highly unlikely that you will be able to send contacts back to your phone.\nWhile the iPhone (iPhone 4 and newer) supports the Bluetooth Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP) the process is typically only one-way.\nThere are two roles in the PBAP profile:\n\n\n*\n\n*Phone Book Server Equipment (PSE) role - this role is for the device that contains the source phone-book objects; for example, a mobile phone.\n\n*Phone Book Client Equipment (PCE) role - this role is for the device that retrieves phone-book objects from the PSE device; for example, a portable navigation device (PND).\nYour iPhone acts as the server and the car radio acts as the client.  \n\nPhone Book Download Feature\nThis feature is used to download the entire content of a phone book\n  object. It is especially designed for devices with relatively large\n  storage capacity that are typically attempting to download and locally\n  store the entire phone book.\nNote that this feature is very basic. In particular, phone book\n  entries are delivered in ascending index order only. No sorting is\n  possible.\n\n\nM = mandatory\nIn the Bluetooth specification for Phone Book Access Profile (where the above info was sourced), there is no \"push\" function; only \"pull.\"  This means for your iPhone to receive the Phone Book, it must change roles to being a client and your car radio to becoming a server.  I can't find any documentation that indicates iPhone supports this role or the Kia radios becoming a server.\n", "Q: How to assign mouse button to Mission Control's 'Application windows' feature? I have a button on the side of my mouse that Mission Control sees as Mouse Button 4.\nIn Mission Control's preferences, I can assign this button to either 'Show Desktop', 'Mission Control' or 'Show Dashboard'.\nAll three of these works fine, but if I try to map it to 'Application windows' the mouse button doesn't respond.\nI'm able to bring up 'Application windows' using the keyboard shortcuts though. \nMy new iMac is 2 days old, so it's on fresh and up to date macOS Sierra. Same problem on my brand new MacBook, again with macOS Sierra.\nIs the mouse shortcut just broken for this? Can anyone else reproduce it?\n[Updated] My mouse is a Logitech G400 Optical Gaming Mouse. I've since installed the Logitech driver software, which also allows you to assign a button to Mission Control (which I did, and then unassigned it from system prefs).\nThis doesn't work properly either, but rather than not responding, all windows move a couple of pixels and then revert back to their original position. Almost like its trying to invoke Mission Control but something is aborting it. I can map the buttons to any other feature and it works fine\n\nA: I use a Logitech MX Master Mouse with my iMac and instead of using the included software, I use a product called ControllerMate.\nIn it, I created a workflow that \n\n\n*\n\n*detects the lower mouse button to show all desktops\n\n*issues a CommandQ to quit\n\n*issues a CommandW to close \n\n\n\nYou can have it send any command/text that you want and I have found it much easier and more reliable than the Logitech software.  \nIn your case, I would assign a keyboard shortcut to Mission Control, then have ControllerMate intercept the mouse button press and then send the keyboard shortcut.\nControllerMate is free for up to 5 building blocks and then $25 for a full license.

So, here’s the thing. I have a new iPhone and an old Mac. iOS 11 (still in beta as of today) and El Capitan (no more updates for this Mac). I use iCloud photo library in both devices. When I take a photo in the new format with my iPhone 7, is there any way to use it right away in my mac, without having to convert it in my iPhone first? I mean, can I get those photos synced through iCloud and converted locally on my Mac?\nI have tried to find a third party software that could do that kind of conversion, but was not able to find any that would work on El Capitan. Any idea?\n\nA: I found Dropbox to be a good conversion tool, as it does it transparently for the usage on any operating system and platform.\nWhen you do the shot from iPhone, Dropbox automatically converts .heic image to .jpg when uploading it to computer (controlled by the settings). Since I'm using both Windows OS and MacOS, there's no need to install separate additional applications. \n\nA: The macOS-native way of doing image conversions like these is apparently sips(1) (raising comments of Pat Niemeyer and jonatan to proper answer status, for improved findability):\nsips -s format jpeg myfile.heic --out myfile.jpg\n\nSo if you have a directory full of HEIC files, you can launch a macOS Big Sur terminal, where, if you run the default Zsh shell, you can make jpeg copies of all those files like this:\nfor i in *.heic(:r) ; sips -s format jpeg \"$i.heic\" --out \"$i.jpg\"\n\n…and presto, you've got jpeg copies!\nIf you want to also nuke the originals, follow up with a rm *.heic –\nor use this variant instead:\nfor i in *.heic(:r) ; sips -s format jpeg \"$i.heic\" --out \"$i.jpg\" && rm \"$1.heic\"\n\n…and integrating Josh Hibschman's tip to also retain timestamps:\nfind . -type f -iname '*.heic' | while read i do \\\n  fileNoExt=\"${i%.*}\"; \\\n  jpgFile=\"${fileNoExt}_heic_conv.jpg\"; \\\n  sips -s format jpeg \"$i\" --out \"$jpgFile\"; \\\n  touch -r \"$i\" \"$jpgFile\"; \\\n  rm \"$i\"; \\\ndone\n\n\nA: We just released this little free app for macOS:\nhttps://imazing.com/heic \nMinimum macOS version is 10.8, so no worries with El Capitan. : )\n\n\nA: Below an online (web browser) conversion tool: doesn’t support batch processing but it will work on a wide range of systems, including non-Apple OSs.\nhttp://heictojpg.com/\n\nA: An excellent command line tool that works very well is tifig.

I've been having some trouble with network handling using MacBooks and MacBooks only.\nAt home I'm using really old NetGear WGR614V9 router, everything works fine but every single one of my Apple laptops (full list at the end of the post) was dropping wi-fi signal every 5-60 minutes for a few seconds, especially under heavy network usage (imagine you're trying to get Linux using Torrent, it takes a good while to find peers then the transfer gets better and better and bam, it drops completely, repeat).\nAt my friend's place once any of my MacBooks joined his network - the whole network became unstable, to the point it was required to reset the router, because it won't accept any new devices.\nAt my parent's flat if I use my MacBook next to any other laptop using wi-fi - Mac is stealing signal REALLY bad, the internet on the laptop next to it is usually unusable.\nCountless times I had problems with wi-fi at hotels and airbnbs (weak signal mostly), while my girlfriend had no issues at all (using cheapest Acer laptop you could imagine). Also often my Android based phones had better wifi strength than MacBooks.\nI've NEVER ever encountered anything close to these issues on any of my Windows/Linux based laptops.\nSo I'm wondering is Apple doing something differently? Are there any Apple-certified routers I could buy so I will be 100% sure they will work like expected (and won't act strange against other non-apple devices)?\nIf it makes any difference I live in Europe and I've been using local MacBooks but my last one is from US distribution and I'm wondering if it might be causing some additional trouble.\nThe Macs I had all of the above problems were these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple MacBook Air 13\" 2010\n\n*Apple MacBook Air 13\" 2011\n\n*Apple MacBook Pro 13\" 2013\n\n*Apple MacBook Pro 13\" 2014\n\n\nI think it might be software-related because often after updates the described problems were getting better and then worse and then better again. Also I'm pretty much sure MacBooks perform much worse than anything with networks that use crowded channels, a few times I could easily connect any device to given wi-fi network excepting MacBooks.\nWhat's going on here? Any hints? \n\nA: In general, no. Apple wifi works very well in my experience and we use it for analysis and measurement and production use. \nHave you done a wire shark dump when a specific computer has specific issues? \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.adriangranados.com/apps/airtool\nThis developer makes awesome tools to support and manage wifi.

I have 4 Dell 1708FPT monitors (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0065638JS) which use either DVI or VGA to connect. \nI am wondering what adapters I would need to get all 4 monitors powered by my MacBook Pro 15 inch early 2013 laptop running macOS Sierra?\n\nA: Hmmm, this is an interesting question because the monitors you want to connect to are only capable of a maximum resolution of 1280 x 1024.\nApple's official stance\nOfficially these MBPs can support up to one HDMI display (at 1920x1080 pixels) while simultaneously connected to a Thunderbolt display (at 2560x1600 pixels), OR being connected to two Thunderbolt displays (both at 2560x1600 pixels).\nUnofficial real-life scenarios\nHowever, unofficially you can exceed this. I'm not aware of anyone who has tried connecting these MBPs to four displays at a lower resolution. What I have seen instead are the following scenarios with the mid-2012 Retina MacBook Pro which uses the exact same setup (NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M and Intel HD Graphics 4000):\n\n\n*\n\n*safely connecting two 27\" Thunderbolt displays each at 2560x1600 pixels while also using the built-in display. Doing this results in about a 23% increase in the MBP's fan speed, but with no long-term damage/problems.\n\n*safely using a single Thunderbolt display at higher resolutions (e.g. 3440x1440) with the MBP in clamshell mode without any problems whatsoever.\n\n*safely using two 27\" iMacs in Target Display Mode (one using a Thunderbolt connection and the other a Thunderbolt/DisplayPort connection) without any problems (both in and out of clamshell mode).\n\n*safely using a single Thunderbolt display at higher resolutions (e.g. 3440x1440) while also using the built-in display. This seems to work okay, although the fans do spin about 30% faster. This is probably the limit of how much I'd recommend pushing things at these resolutions.\nI've also seen users connect three external displays while in clamshell mode. However, this resulted in the MBP's fans spinning at more than double their usual speed when watching videos etc. Not something I would recommend.\nYour unique scenario\nIt's not clear from your question whether you were wanting to use the MBP in clamshell mode. If I assume you do, then you're in a situation where you want to use four external displays with a total of 5,242,880 pixels which is less than the official combinations supported by Apple. So the only problem you're likely to face is how you'd physically do this?\nI see the following solutions for connecting four of these particular displays:\n\n\n*\n\n*Option 1 - Use a combination of two Thunderbolt > DVI adapters, one HDMI > DVI adapter, one USB > DVI adapter.\n\n*Option 2 - Use a combination of two Thunderbolt > VGA adapters, one HDMI > VGA adapter, one USB > VGA adapter.\n\n*Option 3 - A combination of options 1 & 2 above (i.e. you could use one Thunderbolt > DVI adapter and one Thunderbolt > VGA adapter, and either of the HDMI or USB adapter options.\n\n*Option 4 - Utilise two USB adapters and two Thunderbolt adapters.\n\n*Option 5 - Utilise two USB adapters and one Thunderbolt adapter and one HDMI adapter.\n\n\nPersonally I would not recommend Option 4 or Option 5. Not only do these options use up your USB ports, they also double up on using an adapter that will have limitations. By limitations I mean the bandwidth provided by your USB ports will not work well with many games or anything that is graphics intensive. However, if you're just using MS Office or doing some basic web browsing, you should be fine.\nBelow are some links that may be useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt to DVI\n\n*Thunderbolt to VGA\n\n*HDMI to DVI\n\n*HDMI to VGA\n\n*NewerTech USB 3.0/2.0 to DVI, VGA, HDMI \n\n*Kensington Usb Multi Display Video Adapter\nFinally, you may find the Matrox TripleHead2Go DP worth considering.\n", "Q: Extracting data from iPhone backup on iCloud I am trying to extract some data from an old iPhone backup which I have on iCloud. I am looking for a good way to do this. I have two options in mind, neither of which will work well for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*I could restore the data to an iPhone and then manually extract it, but unfortunately I don't have a second iPhone to do this on. Doing this on my main iPhone would disrupt my workflow.\n\n*I could use one of the myriad tools made for Mac or PC which have the purpose of extracting data from your iCloud backup. However, I am very wary of giving my Apple ID away to a third party (you usually need to log into iCloud through this app). \nSo, is there a way to do it which does not have these pitfalls? I'm thinking of a way to download the iCloud backup to my computer, using a third party to extract the local data (in this way I don't need to give my password away), and then obtaining the data. However, I do not know of a way to download an iCloud backup into anything other than when setting up an iPhone after it's been restored.\n\nA: If you don't want to use a third-party tool for an iCloud download, the only canonical Apple way is through a reset and restore.\nAs you say, it'd interrupt your workflow, but depending on the size of the backups involved you might be able to get it done in an hour. The greatest consequence of doing this is that you'd have to reauthenticate most apps on your device after restoring your backup.\nUsing iTunes backups as part of the switcheroo would make this as fast as possible, and you'd do something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use iTunes to back up your iPhone. (An iTunes backup will be fastest. Make sure it's an encrypted backup, as the unencrypted ones don't include everything.)\n\n*Back up your encrypted backup, or move it temporarily onto your desktop. It'll be in one of these folders.\n\n*Erase your iPhone. Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings.\n\n*Restore the iCloud backup that you want to examine to it.\n\n*Back up the newly restored phone with iTunes. (This will overwrite your earlier iTunes backup, as it's the same device. That's why it was important to back it up earlier.)\n\n*Move out the restored phone's iTunes backup, and switch your original iTunes backup into the backup folder.\n\n*Erase and restore your phone from the original iTunes backup so that you're back to where you started. Log back into your assorted apps on the phone.\nStep 5 will have created an iTunes backup of the iCloud backup data you want to examine. You'll then be able to examine that with a bit of hacking around, or use of a third party tool. Good luck. As someone who built the first iPhone backup tool (and later, iCloud backup tool), I'd say it's important to choose the tool you use carefully!\n", "Q: Migration assistant destroyed battery life I got a new computer from work: Macbook Pro 2015. Opened it up and the expected battery life read 14 hours. \nUsed Migration Assistant to upload my old computer, a 2013 Macbook Air. Migration worked fine and the laptop was plugged in the entire time.\nNow, a day later, with the laptop on idle and literally zero apps open and the screen on medium brightness and all that, the expected battery life is 4 hours. \nHow is this possible? \nEDIT Added details.\n\nA: The 14hrs of battery life the MBP reported initially was almost certainly an incorrect reading.\nThe first thing I would do is reset the System Management Controller (SMC) and see what readings you get then. \nReset the SMC\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Unplug the power cable and any other hardware (keyboards, mouse, drives, etc)\n\n*For 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the shiftcontroloption keys (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*After 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button \n\n*Plug in the power cable\n\n*Turn your MBP back on with the power button.\n\n\nOnce you've done that see if you notice any wild fluctuations in what the system reports in terms of your battery life.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nAfter resetting the SMC you can also follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics if you're still concerned:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\nCalibrate your MBP battery\nIf you're still concerned, you can always calibrate the battery. This isn't officially required on MacBook models with built-in batteries, but some users report an improvement after doing so.\nBefore following these steps, read over them fully as you will need to leave your MBP in a flat and powered off state for at least five hours, so you may want to time things to suit you (for example, so that it's in that state overnight while you're sleeping). \nFollow these steps to do the calibration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully charge your MBP - Since we're unsure about how the OS is reading the battery percentages, make sure you go by the charging indicator rather than the battery icon in the menu bar.\n\n*Now use the MBP for a minimum of two hours while it's still plugged into AC power. (Note: You don't have to actually use it, but have it logged in and running off AC power for two hours).\n\n*After a minimum of two hours has passed, unplug the MBP from AC power, but do not shut it down. Leave it logged in or use it as normal during this time.\n\n*Keep using your MBP (or just leave it running) until it automatically goes to sleep because it's diminished its safe power reserves. If you happen to be using it, you should see a warning that the battery is low. Ignore this.\n\n*Eventually your MBP will go to sleep. When it does, press the power button to shut it off fully.\n\n*Wait at least five hours and then plug it into AC power and give it a full charge. Once again, go by the charger to know when it's fully charged.\n\n\nA: If it is relatively clean installation of macOS, then Monomeeth's answer is a good way to rectify the situation with a battery and other hardware and the OS that are not communicating properly anymore. But that way excludes the other possibilities. Therefore I'd like to add a few small bits.\nRegarding \"How\" it's possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"time remaining\" is only an estimate. You shouldn't depend on that. Orient yourself on the hard data. Hard data is the electrical data: actual Current Charge and Full Charge Capacity compared to the Design Capacity. When on battery power another reading comes into play: Discharging with… \nApple removed the time remaining estimate, because it is only an inaccurate estimate and apparently too confusing or disappointing to users (this is not directed at the OP).\n\n*However, a 2015 MBP is not 'new' regarding the battery in 2017. If the battery wasn't replaced in the meantime, then it is also possible that it simply didn't age so well. That might depend on usage or non-usage, being the odd lemon etc. Comparing the specs of the battery with actual readings might give unwelcome surprises there. For a quick glance of battery values use Coconut Battery or any other such tool.\n\n*Even more likely: Migration Assistant is not infallible. It might have introduced cruft or incompatible software. When that runs in the background the machine could look idling, with \"zero apps open\" but is working hard behind the scene.\nThe same effect might occur if all the software brought over with Migration Assistant is trouble free but all the data still has to be indexed by active Spotlight processes. So look into Activity Monitor and Console.app and double check that the computer is really idling.\n", "Q: Does Reinstalling Mac OS from Recovery Clears App data? I need to reinstall Mac OS from recovery since Disk Utility was unable to repair some disk errors.\nI have few notes in the notes app and important Bookmarks/opened tabs in both Chrome and Firefox, Which I don't want to lose.\nDoes this kind of data remain after reinstall? or any other way to repair disk errors without losing on this data?\n\nA: Yes, reinstalling macOS under these circumstances1 may erase app data.\nIf you don't have a Time Machine backup (and you really really should), then the other options you have are:\n\n\n*\n\n*export your bookmarks from Firefox as a html file\n\n*export your bookmarks from Chrome as a html file\n\n*ensure your Notes files are synced to iCloud\n\n\nYou would then just copy the HTML files you exported onto an external USB drive for importing back later, and your Notes files will be available to your other Apple devices (or via the web) assuming you have other Apple devices with iCloud enabled.\nFinally, you could also use Chrome's and Firefox's built-in syncing services to save your bookmarks.\nNOTE: If you don't use iCloud, you could always just copy and paste your Notes into another app from which you can save them onto an external disk (e.g. TextEdit, Pages, MS Word, etc).\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Export Firefox bookmarks to an HTML file to back up or transfer bookmarks\n\n*Google Chrome Help: Import or export bookmarks\n\n*iCloud: Notes overview\n\n*Use Time Machine to back up or restore your Mac\n1 It's unclear what you mean by 'disk errors', but if these are such that your startup volume needs reformatting then your data will be lost.\n\nA: You need to copy or export everything you want to keep onto another disk before attempting to reinstall macOS. There are two options for reinstalling macOS from recovery; one may lose your files and data, the other will lose your files and data.\n\n\n*\n\n*The option I'd recommend in this situation is to use Disk Utility to erase the volume before reinstalling macOS. Unless there's a hardware problem with the disk, this should fix the disk errors, but it will also result in the loss of anything you don't have backed up to another disk. So back up anything you don't want to lose first.\n\n*The other option is to not erase the disk before reinstalling. This will not fix most types of disk/volume errors, and may make the problems much worse. While it won't specifically delete your files, it may damage them accidentally and/or make them even harder to access than they are now. I would not recommend this option, but if you do choose it, my other advice is the same: back up anything you don't want to lose first.\n", "Q: Mac Pro booting to Kali Linux screen without HDD installed I'm in a bit of a predicament.

Also not to confuse you, I am running 10.12.3 and did not install Bootcamp. \nUpon restarting, my Mac Pro passes POST and chimes, but boots to a white/gray screen with NO logo, and then proceeds to run some sort of ISOLINUX bootloader that then presents me with the Kali Linux efi splash screen that does not respond to input: \n\nThat was very unexpected, so I shut it down, pulled all the hard drives, every last one, and rebooted. Same behavior. \nI'm a little worried, because clearly something has been written to the NVRAM onboard, and it is not responding to my Cmd + Opt + P + R\nAlso the Mac bootloader is not showing up. It does not respond to any keyboard input. Holding Opt does nothing. \nHow do I get out of this?\n\nA: Considering that you are only seeing a gray screen with no logo or symbol at all, I'd try some of these starts options, as well as macOS Recovery to repair your Macintosh HD volume if needed.\nThere are a few things you could do at startup.\nFirst, you could hold Option on the keyboard immediately after powering on your Mac, and you should be presented with a screen with a list of volumes to boot you Mac from. Choose Macintosh HD from the list. Have a look at: How to set up and use an external Mac startup disk\nNext, you could hold the X key immediately after powering on your Mac in order to force the machine to attempt to boot from the internal macOS volume.\nLastly, you could hold CommandR in order to access macOS Recovery. This would allow you to check your Mac's disk configuration and even repair the macOS volume if needed. In recovery mode, you can also change your startup disk:\n\nTo quit macOS Recovery, choose Restart or Shut Down from the Apple () menu. If you want to choose a different startup disk before quitting, choose Startup Disk from the Apple menu.\n\nHave a look at: About macOS Recovery\nYou can find more startup options here: Startup key combinations for Mac\nUPDATE: I was able to find an answer that seems to address rEFInd allowing your Mac to boot into neither Recovery nor macOS: Kali Linux auto boot\nI understand that you did remove rEFInd, but this may be worth looking into.\n", "Q: Triple screen on MBP 2016 13\"? I currently own a MBP (2016, 13\", No Touch Bar) as well as an official Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (HDMI version). I have a second screen plugged in (Asus VS247H, HDMI, 24\" 1080p), and everything works OK.\nI was wondering if I could buy another identical adapter to plug a third screen (same as the second) and then have a triple screen setup : MBP screen + 2 external monitors ?\nI would like to avoid buying another 80€ adapter if it will not work. In such case, would anyone know of a viable solution for achieving this ? \n\nA: Yes, this model MBP supports two external displays without any problems, up to 4K each, or a single display at 5K. In both cases the MBP's built-in screen can also be used simultaneously.\nYou may want to consider whether buying another identical adapter is the best way to go, as you may want the flexibility of using another adapter or dock that provides other connection options as well. However, you can certainly achieve what you want and keep your MBP on charge as well.\n", "Q: Skype on MacOS keeps 600Mb caches, are these both deleteable? Skype (7.56.0.776) on MacOS (10.10.5) keeps 600Mb in the two caches below, are these both deleteable without any negative effects? Can I prevent Skype doing this with any (Skype or MacOS) config setting? or do I just have to write a crude wrapper which monitors/purges these regularly? EDIT 1: wrt effect on performance, Skype keeps large disk caches, and crashes regularly, which may well lead to fragmentation.\n348M    ~/Library/Caches/com.skype.skype/<username>/SKAvatarCache\n213M    ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Skype/<username>/media_messaging/emo_cache_v2\n\nRelated to the second: How do I prevent the Skype emoticon cache emo_cache_v2 directory from being populated with automatically downloaded images?\n\nA: There's no need to delete these files, but there's no \"harm\" if you do.\n\n\n*\n\n*The SKAvatarCache holds thumbnails of your contacts for quick access without downloading each and every time from the Internet\n\n*The media_messaging/emo_cache_v2 holds the animated emoticons for faster rendering.\nYou can delete, but these files will be recreated when you view and/or message with contacts.  It's nothing that should be of concern that would require periodic maintenance.\n", "Q: How to use Reason 7 (Reason.app) on macOS Sierra After reinstalling os x and updating it to Sierra I found that Reason 7 would not start. Instead the following error message is displayed:\n\nUnknown installation error\n  An error occurred during installation of installed files. Contact support or reinstall the application. Now terminating.\n\n\nI searched around on the web and found that it's common to have problems using Reason 7 on Sierra, there are various things people have tried, one thing I tried was to start the Reason 9 demo and then to start Reason 7, but this didn't work for me, also, at the time my Reason 9 trial had expired. see: Reason 7 on mac sierra os x issues? reason stops supporting\nI have found that I am able to start Reason 7 using an unconventional method.\nFirst I open the reason folder in finder, then select \"Show Package Contents\"\n\nThis allows me to navigate to locate the Reason unix executable at Reason.app/Content/MacOS/Reason\n\nWhen I execute the Reason file, reason starts up and I can use it normally. I can use my ignition key and after installing the latest version of code meter (6.50b from the codemeter.com) and installing Authorizer using Authorizer.pkg (from the Resources folder inside Reason.app) I was able to auhorize my computer to run reason without the ignition key. If you try this and find that the web page says it can't find code meter, try pressing the reload page button on your browser.\nMy question is: how can I start reason without having to go show package contents and invoke the Reason executable directly?\nIt's seems clear that something extra is happening when I double click the reason.app icon that causes the error, how can I get it to skip that and execute the Reason executable only.\nI've searched around in the Reason.app folder and I imagine that there's something in there that I need to change so that it will invoke the Reason executable immediately instead of trying to install things at start up.\n\nA: To add to the answer, the solution would appear to be found in the following link: \nhttps://www.propellerheads.se/support/user/reason/mac-troubleshooting/where-are-the-sound-banks-in-reason-9/\nThe folder in question in application support should be deleted in order for Reason 9 to launch. This should fix the issue.\n\nA: I've managed to find a stable fix and make Reason 7 work on Sierra(no bugs and fully stable) and now Mojave as well(some visual bugs and stable so far), so I suppose the method will work on any OSX and possibly with any outdated version of Reason.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I reinstalled the stock OSX (Mountain Lion in my case) that comes with the Macbook factory - Internet Recovery boot.(alt-hold while booting + wifi/ethernet + cmd+R)\n\n*Then I installed Reason 7 first thing and opened a project.\n\n*Updated OSX to latest version (in this case Mojave).\n\n*Open Reason. All is good.\n\n\nSome notes:\nVisual Bugs(probably because of the new black/white theme algo):\n\n\n*\n\n*the icons on the main open app splash for authorisation / online log in / demo mode do not seem to show up - everything clickable tho.\n\n*the right-side overview(rack/mixer/sequencer) visual-scroll-bar appears to be blank but works fine.\n\n*also the in-app browser doesn't seem to show the native osx folder icons. Other than that all is good.\n\n\nWorth mentioning:\n\n\n*\n\n*In case your icloud/apple account doesn't seem to log in or sync after update (this seems to be a current issue on latest osx versions) you can fix this easily by creating a new admin account and just migrate (preferably at the beginning) to this new account and delete the old one.\n\n*I recommend upgrading to the latest versions of course although some older macs will not work well with more recent Mac OS, also Reason compatibility or overall performance is tricky to maintain for some of us, so until then this is the best solution.\n\n\nUpdate: Found another visual bug - the pianokeys or drumkeys in the sequencer song-edit mode do not show up, again clickable but not visible. (This is a major nono for me so I had to revert to sierra which is best so far)\nAlso I wouldn't call Mojave stable anymore - 1/10 times Reason fails to open in a crash, although opens right away the second time. Sierra is the way to go.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13 (early 2015) with 4K Television: Can I get 60Hz? The TV has only HDMI inputs. I've found cables on the Internet that will connect Mini DisplayPort to HDMI: AmazonBasics Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Cable - 3 Feet\nMy question is, will I get 60Hz when doing Mini DisplayPort to HDMI? Currently I'm using the HDMI port on my MBP and I'm only getting 30Hz on this TV. I've heard that using the mini DisplayPort will get you 60Hz, but I'm not sure if that still holds true when the other end of the cable is HDMI.\n\nA: The cable that you listed does not support 4K.  In fact, on the description page, it specifically states the following:\n\nSupports video resolutions up to up to 1920x1200 and 1080p (Full HD);\n  easy-grip\n\nIf you are going to convert a signal from one to another (mDP to HDMI in this case) you need an active adapter like the Plugable Active Mini DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0 Adapter \n", "Q: How to open my external hard drive on MacOS? I have external hard drive Transcend. \nPreviously I could work with it without problems , but I did not use it for two month. \nToday I tried to connect to my Mac and result :\nI can see HD in Disc Utility , but I can't see it in Finder.\nIs there a setting to change that would prevent or cause the vipooume to show in finder?\nEDIT\nNow I get new message when I connected HD to Mac\n\nbut anyway I tried to open DiskUtility and execute FirstAid, I got such message\n\nWeird=( How I can check the reason of error and make it work?\n\nA: There are many reasons why a volume won’t mount: How does Mac OS X decide which volumes to mount? One of my disks doesn't mount at boot\nSince yours shows in disk utility, I would either run a verify or repair operation based on if the data is backed up elsewhere. This could be the first sign the filesystem or hardware are failing and when you “repair” a filesystem, sometimes that deletes bad files or causes other data loss. \nIt could also be that the filesystem check is taking hours and that given enough time, it will mount again rapidly once a full check is done. You can see those check details in the disk utility or possibly in /private/var/log while the checks run. \n\nA: If Disk Utility won't fix it you can try a third party disk repair utility. \nI use DiskWarrior but there are others. \nNo guarantees any will work, it just depends on how much the data on that drive is worth to you. \nThe problem might also be hardware related. EG no disk repair utility will fix it.\nIf third party disk repair utilities fail you may have to ship the drive off to a data recovery specialist. That can get expensive.\n", "Q: External hard drive very slow to load after dropping it and can't be repaired with Disk Utility Today as I was using my WD HDD, it fell off my corner. After I fixed the thing, I plugged it into the Mac and it loads the HDD but it's very very very very slow. It also does not work sometimes. The entire laptop just hangs\nTried running Disk Utility First Aid but it won't work.  It says some error and hangs\nCan someone advise me on what I can do in this case?\n\nA: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that external hard disk drive is most likely damaged beyond repair.\n\nI was using my WD HDD, it fell off my corner.\n\nThis is physical damage. No software can fix this.  This is like totaling your car and then trying to fix it by  changing your oil or using better gas.\n\nI fixed the thing, I plugged it into the Mac and it loads the HDD but\n  it's very very very very slow.\n\nIt sounds like there was actual damage that you had to repair, but aside from that, there are two components to an external USB drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB controller which is the bridge between the USB bus and the SATA disk drive\n\n*The SATA disk drive\n\n\nFrom what you describe, the Mac is \"seeing\" the controller, but when it tries to access it, things go \"wrong.\"  This would be consistent with a damaged hard drive.\nThe only thing you can realistically do now is hope that you have backups/copies of what was on that drive.\n\nA: Others have pointed out that your drive is doomed. They are correct.\nYou may be able to get some data off the drive before you trash it.\nIf your data is priceless and you have no backup, unplug the drive and contact a drive recovery service like http://resquoo.me/ for help. Don't plug in the drive if your info is priceless; you may damage it further.\nIf you want to try recovering the data yourself here are some things you can do.\n\n\n*\n\n*plug it in and copy the data, most valuable first.\n\n*once you've done your best with that, stick the drive in a freezer overnight, making it very cold. Then plug it in and try copying more data. That may help.\n\n*warm it up to about 110F (40C) and try again.\n\n\nA: Probably try removing the hard drive from the enclosure and connecting some other way (i.e. another enclosure, or into the motherboard). You might get lucky.\n", "Q: Is there any way to upgrade my jailbroken iPad to a higher jailbreakable iOS? I have a jailbroken fourth-generation iPad running iOS 6.1.3.  I'd like to upgrade it to some higher iOS, but not the latest iOS (10.3.3 or 11), since no jailbreak exists for that.  My question is, is there anyway I can upgrade my iPad to an iOS for which a jailbreak exists?\nI think the short answer to my question is \"blobs\".  In the old days there was just SHSH blobs, but now the terminology is more complicated, like SHSH2, ApTicket, and TSS.  In any case, how do I check if I have the right kind of blobs  to do the kind of upgrade I want?  Are they still saved in Cydia like in the old days, or what?\n\nA: Short answer\nNo, unfortunately not.\nExplanation\nWithout any manually saved SHSH blobs for your desired version of iOS and your device you cannot upgrade to this version of iOS.\nCheck https://api.ineal.me/tss/status to see which firmware versions are currently being signed by Apple.\nAs of today Apple signs only this iPad 4 (iPad 3,4; 3,5; 3,6) firmware:\n10.3.3    14G60\nAdditional Resources\nYou may check whether there are SHSH2 blobs available for your device:\nhttps://tsssaver.1conan.com\nYou can get you ECID by\n\n\n*\n\n*Lauching iTunes\n\n*Connecting your device using a Lightning cable to your computer\n\n*Selecting your device in iTunes\n\n*Clicking the serial number twice\n\n", "Q: Apple Music downgrade from family plan keeping music I currently have a family plan with myself and 4 family members. Only my daughter is actively using Apple Music with over 2000 songs. I would like to downgrade the service to a single user for her to a student plan (she's in college). \nIs there any way she can keep her music if I downgrade to a single user?\n\nA: I believe she can make a smart playlist of all the music she has in Apple Music and then export those playlist to files listing the songs. \nWhen you terminate the subscription, she may or may not have a grace period before the music disappears from her library and playlists (which could end up empty playlists). When she signs back up, she would then either not lose anything if there is a grace period or she would import the playlists back and then re-download local copies if she uses that feature. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205928\nThe dual membership option with no presumed down time or need to make any changes is documented above. Once your student membership bills, you can cancel the other plan - perhaps timing the billing cycles to have a day or three overlap only. \nA call or web chat to Apple support might be prudent to have them check if you have a grace period or she can sign up herself now and have a more seamless transition. \n", "Q: Is FaceTime free (including internationally)? From what I've read so far, it seems like VIDEO FaceTime will be free for both parties, other than:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the party is using WiFi, whatever they have to pay their ISP for internet access. This is usually a flat rate, though some people have data caps.\n\n*If the party is using cellular service (e.g. 4G), whatever they have to pay their carrier for internet access. This may be \"unlimited\" or charged per GB.\n\n\nIf you change to audio-only then it may become a regular phone call for both parties, which will typically be free within the same country but extremely expensive between two different countries.\nIs the above correct? I want to FaceTime my friend in China but I was worried about paying a huge rate. However if the above is correct then we should be OK as long as we are using video. See The Telegraph's Why did my FaceTime calls to Switzerland cost £144? suggests downgrading to audio can hurt, but I am not sure if the article is accurate.\n\nA: Both FaceTime and FaceTime Audio are data and never go through the phone network as a regular phone call. You will be charged in the same way as using the internet for other purposes on your phone, over Wi-Fi or mobile data depending on your scenario.\nFaceTime Audio calls don't ‘become’ regular calls. I'm almost certain the case from the linked article must be describing user error, calling someone not through FaceTime Audio but a normal phone call, and the user mistook the buttons they were pressing on their phone.\nBesides any network fees, Apple does not charge a toll or fee to make or receive any calls. The license to the software and iCloud infrastructure is included with the cost of the Apple hardware.\nThere are certain countries that prohibit FaceTime services such as Saudi Arabia and UAE so you would not be able to make FaceTime or FaceTime Audio calls to these locations, but this would not cause a switch to normal calls. Net neutrality is evolving in several countries and there is no technical reason why FaceTime audio or video couldn’t be charged for above and beyond other forms of data.\n", "Q: How To Resolve Finder Graphical Errors on macOS I've had a very strange Finer error caused by recent macOS High Sierra betas that affected Macs running macOS 10.13 as well as macOS 10.12 Sierra. This error causes an entire Finder window to show visual artifacts when opening certain folders on either an APFS or HFS+ volume.  After moving the cursor or the affected Finder window, the window may look something like this;\n\nAttempting to use Disk Utility to repair the affected volume does not resolve this issue, nor does restarting the affected Mac (even in Safe Mode).  Without formatting this disk, how can I prevent Finder from exhibiting this graphical error when opening particular folders?\n\nA: This unusual error is very easy to resolve: \n\n\n*\n\n*To resolve the error, first open the affected folder so that a Finder window is exhibiting the unexpected visual errors.\n\n*Select Finder's \"View\" menu, then \"Clean Up\"\n\n*If \"Clean Up\" is unavailable or does not resolve the issue, hover over \"Arrange By\" then select \"Name\"\n", "Q: CMD-Z reopens last tab instead of undoing This is unbelievably annoying, since when I code online, there is no means of undoing, and thus retrieving the text I deleted. \n\nA: If you use a language other than English and the proposed solution by grg doesn't work, specify in System Preferences > Keyboard the equivalent to \"Undo Close Tab\" in your language.\nFor example, if Safari's interface language is Russian, open a tab, close it, select the Edit menu:\n.\nand use the text next to CommandZ (that is, 'Отменить закрытие вкладки') instead of \"Undo Close Tab\".\n\nA: Most online text editors which support keyboard shortcuts (like the Stack Exchange editor right here!) support ⌃Z (ctrl-Z) for undo too, which won't cause any system functions to be fired.\nIf you want to use ⌘Z, you can remap the Undo Close Tab function off ⌘Z to something else using System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts.

The reason for this is you make only one lower level call (properties of current track) and then the assigning of the other variables gets the info from a variable containing all the info, and not making 15 separate lower level calls to get the info,  This should be faster and more efficient code. \ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    if running then\n        set state to player state\n        if state = playing then\n            set trackProperties to (properties of current track)\n            set theArtist to artist in trackProperties\n            set theTitle to name in trackProperties\n            set theAlbum to album in trackProperties\n            set theTime to time of trackProperties\n            set theGrouping to grouping in trackProperties\n            set theGenre to genre in trackProperties\n            set theKind to kind in trackProperties\n            set theYear to year of trackProperties\n            set theComments to comment in trackProperties\n            set playCount to played count in trackProperties\n            set theTrack to track number in trackProperties\n            set numTracks to track count in trackProperties\n            set theDisc to disc number in trackProperties\n            set numDiscs to disc count in trackProperties\n            set bitRate to bit rate in trackProperties\n            try\n                set thePath to POSIX path of (get location of current track)\n            on error\n                set thePath to \"Not playing from local library.\"\n            end try\n        else\n            set state to \"none\"\n        end if\n    else\n        set state to \"none\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\nA: This works for me on the latest version of Sierra\ntell application \"iTunes\" to POSIX path of (get location of current track)\n\n\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set fileLocation to POSIX path of (get location of current track)\nend tell\n\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if application process \"iTunes\" exists then\n        tell application \"iTunes\"\n            set state to player state\n            if state = playing then\n                set fileLocation to POSIX path of (get location of current track)\n                tell current track\n                    set theArtist to artist\n                    set theTitle to name\n                    set theAlbum to album\n                    set theTime to time\n                    set theGrouping to grouping\n                    set theGenre to genre\n                    set theKind to kind\n                    set theYear to year\n                    set theComments to comment\n                    set playCount to played count\n                    set theTrack to track number\n                    set numTracks to track count\n                    set theDisc to disc number\n                    set numDiscs to disc count\n                    set bitRate to bit rate\n                end tell\n            else\n                set state to \"none\"\n            end if\n        end tell\n    else\n        set state to \"none\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How can I read markdown files with QuickLook?

I use quite a few plugins for the editing bit, which in Aperture could be done with the lossless TIFF file format. However, when using a plugin in Photos I see the image file has been converted to JPG. Is there a way to change this to also use TIFF or PNG?\nI'm unable to see any quality loss with my own eyes, but I prefer to keep my photos as high quality as possible for print etc.\n\nA: Short answer : If the plugin has no option to select \"TIFF\", you'll have to live with JPEG\nLong answer: When you look at the example source code that apple provides for Photos plugins (Photos sample code for plugins), you can see that the file types for the output are explicitly set to kUTTypeJPEG by\n            guard let destination = CGImageDestinationCreateWithURL(output.renderedContentURL as CFURL, kUTTypeJPEG, 1, nil)\n\nThis means that the plugin decides the format it writes to. If the format is hardcoded and the plugin does not give you the choice to change the output format to TIFF, you will have to live with its choice. If it allows you to write to kUTTypeTIFF, you get what you want.\nHope this helps you.\n", "Q: What happens if you run \"open /Applications/*\" I recently read in a blog post don't run open \"/Applications/*\" otherwise many tabs will reopen, But I ran it in Terminal and then suddenly all my apps in my Applications started to open my Mac started to heat up to 60 C and fans 1460 RPM I immediately force quit all the apps.What does \"open Applications/*\" do? and what is the meaning of *?\n\nA: This command opens all apps in the /Applications folder.

Both weren't really made for each other and if FileVault2 comes into the picture things leave the pretty phase.\nThe currently nicest solution for dual booting macOS and Debian would have to be using The rEFInd Boot Manager. \n\nrEFInd is a boot manager, meaning that it presents a menu of options\n  to the user when the computer first starts up, as shown below. rEFInd\n  is not a boot loader, which is a program that loads an OS kernel and\n  hands off control to it.

We got around it and changed the password to iCloud. Yesterday when we arrived home, and turned on the MacBook it was firmware locked. We can't do nothing. \nI called Apple which could not help. Apparently they need to send it in for service which could take more than a week. Since uni starts tomorrow we really need to fix this ASAP!\nAnyone in this community that are able to help?\nIt is a MacBook Pro from 2015 with no access to battery or RAM sticks. \nThis really really sucks!!\n\n\nA: My suggestion is to create a bootable flash drive with the macOS Sierra installer on it.\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the flash drive.\n\n*Erase the internal harddisk.\n\n*Reinstall macOS Sierra.\n\n \nPreparation:\n\n*\n\n*You will need another Mac in other to create the bootable flash drive. So hopefully you have another Mac in your household, of family/friends household. Last resort is go to the local Apple store. They are willing to help.\n\n*Download macOS Sierra Installer from the Mac App Store. Once the download completes, it will automatically launch. Quit macOS Sierra Installer app without performing the installation.\n\n*Take a 16GB or larger USB flash drive to create a bootable Sierra installer. This flash drive is only needed for a clean install on your Mac’s startup drive.\n\n \nHow to create a bootable flash drive:\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable flash drive with macOS Sierra.\n\nFirst, make sure your USB flash drive is formatted and named as “Untitled”.\n\n*\n\n*To format a USB drive launch Disk Utility (Finder -> /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility).\n\n*Select your USB drive under External.\n\n*Click the Erase tab at the top of the Disk Utility window. Select Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the format list. Then, click the Erase button. When the process is complete, click Done, and close the Disk Utility window.\n\n*If your drive is named something else, you need to rename it (Open Finder -> right click on the USB drive and choose Rename).\n\nNow, your USB flash drive is ready.\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal (Finder/Applications/Utilities/Terminal)\n\n\n*Enter the following text into Terminal. It may be best to just copy it from here (try triple-clicking) and paste it in.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app --nointeraction\n\n\n*Hit the Enter key.\n\n\n*Terminal will ask you for an admin password (the one you use to log in). It won’t display characters when you type, so just do it. Hit Return. You’ll see that Terminal erases your drive. Then, Terminal will copy the installer file to your disk. This will take a few minutes. When the process is complete, the Terminal window will report \"Done.\" You can quit Terminal and your bootable macOS Sierra installer USB drive is ready for use.\n \n\n\n*Plug in the bootable macOS Sierra installer USB drive to your Mac.\n\n*Restart your Mac while holding the Option key or Cmd+R. Make sure to keep it pressed!\n\n*When Mac restarts, you’ll see the macOS Startup Manager with a list of bootable devices that your Mac can start up from.\n\n*Use the arrow keys to choose your USB drive with macOS Sierra installer. Press Enter.\n\n*Select Disk Utility.\n\n*In the window, at the top of the left bar, select your Mac’s Main Drive (it looks like a MacintoshHD).\n\n*Select the Erase tab located next to the First Aid button at the top.\n\n*Near the center of the window, select the Format drop-down list and select Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) type.\n\n*Click Erase (Note: this will erase all your data from your main drive!) and give the drive some time to format.\n\n*When it’s done, close Disk Utility and select “Install macOS” from the menu.\n\n*Select your main drive and install the new macOS Sierra 10.12.\n\n \nHow to go further..\n\n*\n\n*Make regular backups. At least one onsite and preferably also one offsite.\n\n*Change all your girlfriends passwords. Probably your girlfriends iCloud password was the same as from another website.

Use different once for every account.\n\n*Enable Two-factor Authentication for her Apple ID\n\n", "Q: Terminal/ZSH Problems & Permission problems I downloaded something out of the Internet and executed it, which might could have malware.

To check which one is providing you the completion function you like, just get which shell you are using on Linux with:\necho ${SHELL}\n\nThen change your login shell on MacOS X with:\nchsh -s /bin/my_preferred_shell\n\nto use the one which is performing the completion function you want.\nCheck that this shell exists and is executable, and read the documentation of chsh:\nls -ld /bin/my_preferred_shell\n\nman chsh\n\nTo test it without risk, don't restart your session, just open a new Terminal.

It has been tested in MacBook Pro Intel (Big Sur v11.5) and in MacBook Apple M1 Pro (Ventura 13.1):\nFirst, block your Mac from reaching the domain iprofiles.apple.com. I use LittleSnitch as my firewall, so I blocked it there, but you can also use your hosts file like:\nsudo echo \"0.0.0.0 iprofiles.apple.com\" >> /etc/hosts\n\nOR\nOpen the /etc/hosts file in your MacBook by running the command below:\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\nNote: It will require you to input your MacBook password since it's an admin action.\nNext, add the lines below at the bottom of the file:\n# Block Mac from reaching the domain iprofiles.apple.com\n0.0.0.0 iprofiles.apple.com\n\nSave the file.\nThen, check the current enrollment profile:\nsudo profiles show -type enrollment\n\nThis will show you the current enrollment configuration your Mac has, you can even block the domain mentioned in ConfigurationURL just to be safe. It might also return the error below:\n\nError fetching Device Enrollment configuration: (34000) Error Domain=MCCloudConfigurationErrorDomain Code=34000 \"The device failed to request configuration from the cloud.\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=The device failed to request configuration from the cloud., CloudConfigurationErrorType=CloudConfigurationFatalError}\n\nAfter that, proceed to delete the profile, in regular session, not recovery, although it would probably also work in recovery:\nsudo profiles remove -all\n\nKeep in mind that this command will delete all other profiles you may have, in my case, I didn't have any other.\nFinally, you can check for the enrollment profile again. It would throw an error saying that it could not be retrieved given that the domain from it's retrieved is now blocked:\nsudo profiles show -type enrollment\nError fetching Device Enrollment configuration: (34000) Error Domain=MCCloudConfigurationErrorDomain Code=34000 \"The device failed to request configuration from the cloud.\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=The device failed to request configuration from the cloud., CloudConfigurationErrorType=CloudConfigurationFatalError}\n\nAnd the notification is gone for good.

Is that true?\n\nA: you always use data to text using imessage, although if you have it set to text message. it will not \n( as seen in picture ) \n\n", "Q: Two-factor authentication: why was I asked for my iPhone passcode after I entered the verification code? I signed into iCloud in my Mac and I was sent a verification code to my iPhone, which I entered in the Mac.  But then I was surprised to be asked for the iPhone passcode.\n\nI then got this dialog box, what protected data would be unavailable?\nThis situation actually never happened again, but I keep asking myself: in what situation are you required to enter the iPhone passcode?\n\nA: Apple does not hold encryption keys to certain types of protected data held in iCloud such as passwords, health and home. You need to enter your passcode to allow this new device to decrypt your data.\n\nA: I got it.  This happens when you have two-factor authentication enabled for your apple ID, you have your iPhone as a trusted device already, and then you sign into iCloud in a new device and, instead of using the verification code sent to the iPhone, you choose it to be sent on a text message to a trusted phone number on another phone (Apple or not).  After you enter the verification code, you're asked for the iPhone passcode.  The same happens if you have a mac as a trusted device and then sign into iCloud in an iPhone: you're asked for the Mac log in password.  I wonder now what would happen if you sign into a third or fourth apple device in this manner. I guess you'd be asked for the passcode or password for any of your trusted devices.\n", "Q: Is my MacBook security compromised? About a week ago, I installed an application in my MacBook from a dubious source. Since then I noticed some weird behaviours.\nFirst, while I was making a bank transfer in Safari, I got the following popup warning:\n\n“Safari” would like to control this computer using accessibility\n  features\n\nI denied the access, as it never asked for it before and I saw no reason to grant it.\nA couple of days later, while I was browsing, I clicked on a google result and got redirected to a blank page. I thought the site was not working so I clicked back. I then got this message:\n\nWhich was not the site I clicked at all in Google results. I got back to Google results and clicked again on the same result. I was redirected to the correct page without any problem.\nI got suspicious and installed Antivirus Thor Lite from the App Store. It detected several infected files with Pua.Win.Trojan. But I think that these are files infected with Windows viruses and that they don't compromise my Mac. Malwarebytes does not detect any issue either.\nRight now I'm suspecting that I may be somehow infected. What do you guys think? Whats the best way to know for sure if I'm infected?\n\nA: download, install and run a scan from Malwarebytes for Mac. Sounds like you have malware installed.\n", "Q: iPad possibly stolen, not appearing in Find my iPhone, what options do I have? I suspect that my cleaner has stolen my iPad Pro. I restored from an iCloud backup of an iPhone. It does not show up in find my iPhone on safari or my iPhone. I only had the device a week and hadn't had the time to properly set it up. I have definitely signed into iCloud on the device though. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any thing I can do to track it down, send a message etc without Find my iPhone?\n\n*Can I reauthorise it so my iMessages aren't sent there? \nBefore I definitely had my iMessages and other notifications being sent there\n\nA: It's not clear from your question whether you have or haven't set up the iPad Pro with the Find my iPhone feature. However, at the risk of oversimplifying things, if the device:\n\n\n*\n\n*doesn't appear in your devices list either on Find my iPhone or on iCloud Find (which is how I interpret your question) then it's almost certainly not set up with Find my iPhone. If this is the case, then you should definitely change your Apple ID password! This will prevent anyone else who may have accessed your iPad Pro from deleting your data from iCloud or making other unwanted changes.\n\n*does appear, but is just showing as offline, then it is set up with Find my iPhone but is just currently not online.\n\n\nTo answer your question on whether you can send a message to it, and assuming it's not set up with Fine my iPhone, then you can still send a message but not via Find my iPhone. Instead, because you were getting iMessages on the device, all you need to do is send an iMessage from your iPhone to whatever number/email address/account was being used on the iPad Pro to receive messages.\nIMPORTANT\nBefore doing anything else I would heed my advice above re changing your Apple ID password, unless of course you do want to send an iMessage to it first. But if that's the case, then I'd do it ASAP and reset your password.\n", "Q: My Mac won't connect with Ethernet but will to wireless I apologize if this is a stupid question, but I'm not very tech-savvy. Using a iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2010), running El Capitan version 10.11.6. Router is Amped Wireless ATHENA, High Power AC2600 Wi-Fi Router with MU-MIMO (RTA2600).\nI have a Mac computer that is hardwired for Internet (I have a cable plugged into back of computer). My husband also has a computer hardwired, which is not a Mac. We also have wireless service. \nEarlier we had to reboot the modem and router.  Now, my husband's computer will work with Ethernet, but mine will not. I can only get connectivity with my Mac via wireless (192.168.X.XXX). I've checked network settings and it says Ethernet is connected but cannot connect to the Internet. \nWhy not? It is setup as DHCP. I have no clue what to do.  Again, none of this happened until we rebooted/reset the router and modem.  \nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\nI did do a \"renew\" as suggested and the IP address came back as 169.254.xxx.xxx. I also noticed the \"router\" field is blank. Subnet mask is populated. \n\nA: \nthe IP address came back as 169.254.122.206.\n\nThe 169.254.xxx.xxx address is a \"self assigned address.\"  It gets this address because it didn't get a DHCP lease from the DHCP server.  This could be due to either of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*No connection between your iMac and the router/switch\n\n*DHCP server is down\n\n\nCheck your cabling from the back of the iMac all the way to the router.  Make sure everything is plugged in properly.  If you look at your Network Settings, it should be \"green\" and say \"connected\".  \n\nIf it's yellow, that means it's plugged into a switch (getting power), but not communicating with anything.  Check the settings on your router to be certain that the DHCP server is up and running.   \n\nA: Here are the steps I followed to solve the issue on a Mac OS Cataline:\n0-Start my mac without being connected to the lan.\nNote: if I connect my mac to the lan and then I start my mac I do not have to do the below steps because it works fine and my mac gets connected.\n1-Connect my lan cable to my mac\n2-Go to system preferences -> network\n3-Select my ethernet card that is not working despite the fact that my lan cable is connected  (cf. image 1 below)\n￼\nRemove this ethernet by clicking on the minus button (cf. image 2 below)\n\n￼\nSelect my bluetooth card (cf. image 3 below)\n\n￼\nAnd click on the advance settings + select « renew the dhcp » + apply + ok to exit this window\nThen click on the plus button to add a new ethernet interface  (cf. image 4 below)\n￼\n\nClick on apply and the ethernet goes green to show that it is now connected. (cf. image 5 below)\n￼\nThe problem is not fully solved because I have to do these steps each time.\nIt is not automatic. I need to find out how to make it automatic.\n\nA: I started with my ethernet not connecting during Catalina. Here's how I solved this problem. It was time to update, so I let my iMac Retina upgrade itself to Big Sur and the issue still remained. Having successfully tested the router gateway, I knew it had to be the iMac hardware or the OS.\nI did a clean install of Big Sur. I backed up my important files, used the recovery utilities to wipe my SSD, made a bootable USB drive with Big Sur onboard and did the deed. Now there are no further ethernet issues. Hope this helps you.\n\nA: What I found is when I went into \"network\" in settings and where they list the Ethernet, Wi-Fi, FireWire and Bluetooth where it said I was connected I deleted the ethernet using the - sign, then added it again using the + sign and choosing ethernet in the drop down menu in interface.\n", "Q: Force \"low power mode\" on mac When there is less than 5% battery left on a mac, the battery indicator goes red and system performance significantly drops - presumably in an attempt to make that remaining 5% last a little longer. \nIs there a way to manually trigger this, so that the system performance is low (and battery life longer), even when there is plentiful battery? \nThis would theoretically be a way of extending the number of hours on a battery beyond the rated amount. \n\nA: I'm using underclocking app volta, seems to be working so far.\n\nA: Energy Saver preferences\nThe easiest way to manage your power consumption on a MacBook model is to use the Energy Saver preference Pane.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Select the Energy Saver preference pane\n\n*You'll now have access to a range of settings. \n\n*Since you're interested in reducing power usage while on battery power, select the Battery tab. \n\n\nNOTE: The options you'll have here will depend on your Mac model and version of macOS. For example, models with both built-in and dedicated graphics cards will provide a graphics switching checkbox that configures your Mac to automatically switch between graphics modes to improve battery life.\nDisplay brightness\nThe most obvious other factor that can reduce battery consumption is reducing the brightness level of your built-in display. You can access this from Apple > System Preferences > Displays.\nFurther reading\nYou may find the following resources useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Energy Saver settings on your Mac\n\n*About Energy Saver sleep and idle modes in Mac OS X\n\nA: Just adding to Monomeeth's answer: \n\n\n*\n\n*Quitting all applications not currently needed or in active use \n\n*disabling Bluetooth and WiFi, if possible\n\n*disabling as much options, services, background processes etc. as possible (anything related to syncing, overcrowded Notification Center…)  \n\n\nLowering the Processor Speed:\n\n\n*\n\n*and closest to what you directly asked: disable at least TurboBoost on the main processor with e.g.  Turbo Boost Switcher. That will keep your CPU cooler, less Watt-hungry and, if you have fans, keeps your fans down. \n\n\nA: \nNote: This expands on the previous answers by LаngLаngС, Monomeeth, and diegoalberto.\n\nMy understanding of the Low Power Mode feature on iOS is that it affects three main areas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display: reduces the brightness of the display, and limits how long it stays on while inactive (30 seconds)\n\n*Performance: reduces the performance of active foreground tasks, and significantly reduces the performance and frequency of background tasks\n\n*Network activity: stops nearly all background network updates (e.g., it stops fetching email automatically, or pre-loading the latest posts in your Facebook news feed)\n\n\nSo, here’s what you can do on the Mac to manually replicate this functionality:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display:\n\n\n*\n\n*turn down the screen brightness\n\n*use the Energy Saver panel in System Preferences to adjust how quickly the screen turns off when you’re not actively using your computer\n\n\n*Performance:\n\n\n*\n\n*disable the Turbo Boost CPU over-clocking feature (see What is the new turbo boost in the MacBook line?), using an app like Turbo Boost Switcher (free and paid versions available), or Volta (paid, with a 7-day trial)\n\n*limit how much physical electrical energy (watts) the CPU is actually allowed to draw, using the Volta app mentioned above\n\n*if you have a MacBook Pro, force your computer to use only the slower, “integrated” GPU for graphics—instead of the faster, dedicated (“discrete”) GPU—with an app like gfxCardStatus (free) [note: there are some limitations for when this is allowed—the discrete GPU is still required by some apps, and for using external displays)\n\n\n*\n\n*on Macs with this dedicated, discrete GPU, the Energy Saver panel of System Preferences does have an option for automatic graphics switching that is on by default\n\n\n\n*Network activity:\n\n\n*\n\n*besides just turning off WiFi and Bluetooth, you can also limit which apps are allowed to use your network connection, with an app like Trip Mode (paid, or as part of the Setapp subscription bundle)\n\n\n\n\nExample: In 2018, Marco Arment wrote a great little piece explaining how useful it would be to have a “Low Power Mode” feature on the Mac. By experimenting with the Volta app to disable the Turbo Boost feature, and limit the amount of energy (watts) the CPU was allowed to use, he was able to get up to 50-100% extra battery life, depending on the setting he used.\n\nOther common tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software:\n\n\n*\n\n*keep your apps and operating system as up-to-date as possible, especially when major new versions are released\n\n*use the built-in Activity Monitor app to monitor which apps are using a lot of resources (especially the Energy tab, with the list sorted by Energy Impact)\n\n\n*Hardware: (not applicable to all Macs, especially newer ones that can’t be upgraded after purchase)\n\n\n*\n\n*if you are using an older, mechanical (spinning) hard drive, replace it with an SSD (solid-state drive), which will not only be much faster, but require less power\n\n*if you use a lot of apps at once, or apps that process a lot of data, or use a lot of browser tabs, upgrade the system memory (RAM)—when it gets full, the system has to save temporary data to the hard drive instead, which requires extra processing (you can always monitor memory usage in the same built-in Activity Monitor app)\n\n\n", "Q: Macbook pro 13 (2017) with Asus PB279Q only works in safe mode I just bought a Macbook 13 (2017) without touch bar. \nI'm having this issue in which in order to make it work with my Asus PB279Q, I have to start in safe mode. Once the display is working in safe mode if I re start the macbook again to normal boot, the display will continue working just fine. \nWeirdly enough, if I disconnect the display and reconnect; the screen just goes dark. I can see the screen being detected in settings, but I can't see anything on screen. In order to make it work again I need to repeat the process, 1)boot in safe mode 2) boot in normal mode again. \nI'm using a Kanex usb-c to hdmi cable I bought in the Apple Store, supposedly 4k capable and compatible with mac. \nWondering if anyone has had this weird issue ?\n\nA: I'm not quite sure if this qualifies as an answer because the technical issue with the Kanex cable persist. So mods feel free to delete if needed. \nYeah, the magical Apple like solution was to buy the pricey Apple proprietary usb-c Multiport Adaptor.\n", "Q: Is there any problem I should watch out for in running the Nix package manager alongside Homebrew? I'm starting on a fresh macOS install and so far only have Nix installed. Can Homebrew coexist well with it or do I have to pick one and stick with it?\n\nA: My experience so far is that yes, you can run both. I also naïvely installed nix thinking I would use that instead of homebrew, but I soon ran into packages that were only found in homebrew. So I installed both and never had any conflicts. And there should be none, as they simply overlay scopes sequentially. If you evaluate nix after homebrew in your path, it will take precedence, and vice-versa. Their stores are completely separate.\nHowever if you want to be super clean, you can do this:\n$ <install homebrew>\n$ brew tap caskroom/cask\n$ brew cask install nix\n\nYes, nix is currently just another package within cask! Isn't that amazing?\n", "Q: Website that uses iPhoto or Photos library as the database I've begun creating a centralised iPhoto library of all the family photos and was hoping to share it with my family members in a well presented way rather than just sending them the raw images.\nMy current process is:\n- Scan the image\n- Add a rough date to the meta of the image in iPhoto\n- Use facial recognition in iPhoto to group / tag images by who they are\nThe last two steps are fairly pointless if I am just providing raw files. Ideally I would like to create a website, that allows me to display the images from the iPhoto library in the following ways:\n- by album\n- by recently added\n- by facially recognised people\n- by date\nI can't find anyone who has done this before and I can't find anyone who is pulling content straight from iPhoto onto a website. Any ideas of how I could do this, has anyone done this before, does anyone have any alternatives that would enable me to still achieve display options in the above 4 ways?\nWorth noting that I have considered just uploading them all to Facebook and making the album private but their privacy policy doesn't excite me when the images in this photo repository include photos of myself naked as a child\n\nA: Have you considered using iCloud Photo Sharing? \nThis can be used to share specific photo albums, so you could create one for each of the four categories. You can also share these as a public website so that people who aren't part of Apple's ecosystem can also view them.\nFor more information refer to: iCloud Photo Sharing.\nNOTE: One limitation you should be aware of is that currently iCloud Photo Sharing limits you to sharing no more than 5,000 photos/videos.\n\nA: You can transfer your photos to PC, and save them there, then use some kind of USB to copy those photos to anyone you need to share with.\n", "Q: AirPods sound is quieter on the right side My right AirPod connected to my Macbook Pro 2015 plays quieter than left. \nBut if AirPods are connected to the iPhone everything works fine and both of them sounds good. \nAny ideas or Solutions? \n\nA: Check your System Preferences -> Sound -> Output (tab) -> Balance.

I do not have the passcode. I also do not have access to iTunes. My only computer is a Linux Ubuntu 16.04. I have tried to run iTunes under Wine and PlayOnLinux as suggested in some other posts, but neither of those worked. iTunes wouldn't run under Wine and PlayOnLinux didn't have USB support. \nInstalling Windows to a new partition and running iTunes from there is an absolute last resort that i would like to avoid. I am also not reasonably close to an Apple Store.\nIs it possible for me to reset this phone without doing that, and if so, how would I do it?\n\nA: You can wipe your phone remotely by using the web-based iCloud Dashboard, using the Find My iPhone feature. You can add a trusted phone number through the same interface, and use that phone number to receive the code to wipe your phone.\n", "Q: Airport Time Capsule US power cord in Europe? I have a US power cord for my AirPort Time Capsule (802.11ac 2TB), and I want to use it in Europe (specifically Norway). The power outlets here deliver 220V rather than the 120V a US power outlet delivers. Will a simple plug adapter be enough, or will that fry my AirPort? That is, can the AirPort Time Capsule sold in the US handle 220V as well as 120V? \n\nA: I remember reading the tech specs for Timecapsule some time ago and it is specified it has a range of 100V to 240V. So it should be fine.\n\nAirPort Time Capsule 802.11ac - Technical Specifications\nElectrical and Environmental Requirements\n\n*\n\n*100-240V AC, 50-60Hz; input current: 1.5 amp\n\n\nYou can check this, too.\nHere is a link to the Apple TimeCapsule Technical Specifications - please also check if this is your version of Timecapsule.\nHave a good trip!\n\nA: From the Apple Support Technical Specifications pages, it appears that Time Capsules (2nd gen, 3rd gen, 4th gen, 802.11ac) all show as capable of accepting voltages between 100V - 240V, AC, 50-60 Hz. So a simple outlet adaptor should work OK for these models.\nYou did not specify which version you had, so please check the specifications for your particular model.\nEdit to add: It may be prudent to set up your Time Capsule with the region set to Norway as there are some slight differences between USA and EU WiFi channels.

Most of the things I usually search for are not like the ones filtered in.\nI have seen this question. The difference here is I want to eliminate the search criteria completely. \n\nA: As long as SIP is disabled in your machine, you should be able to edit /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/default_smart.plist to change the default search criteria. \nTry this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make your desired default search in Finder and then save it like you would normally save your search.\n\n*Go to the saved searches folder (unless you saved it somewhere else) ~/Library/Saved Searches/\n\n\n*\n\n*In newer OS versions the Library folder inside the user folder should be hidden, so just use the Go to Folder method in the top menu in Finder Go > Go to folder... and paste the path there.\n\n\n*Open your .savedSearch file with TextEdit.app\n\n*Copy & Paste all the contents of that file to that default_smart.plist file: /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/default_smart.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*You can locate this file with the Go to folder... method as well.\n\n*You may want to make sure you got a copy of that original default_smart.plist beforehand...\n\n\n\nThen test out the search.\n", "Q: Animate text in final cut pro: knocking previous text further from centre How can I animate a sentence in final cut pro,\nwhere each word in the sentence slides in from the right (violently), slamming into place in the middle of the screen, knocking the previous word further to the left (but not off the screen, it just stops when the new word stops.)\nI hope that can help you understand what I'm going for, I can't find any examples of this effect even though I'm certain I've seen it before and often.\n\nA: The Apple tool for that job is Motion and it can make plug in for iMovie or just do the work you want.

But unfortunately when I try to access this drive on macOS itself the Apple_CoreStorage partition doesn't mount.\nHere's my diskutil list output:\n\npaulofreitas@Paulos-MacBook-Pro:~$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +498.9 GB   disk1\n                                 Logical Volume on disk0s2\n                                 F0CA4975-A73D-46D6-92AB-4A4DDF3DFFF7\n                                 Unencrypted\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                  Apple_HFS Storage                 2.0 TB     disk2s1\n\n/dev/disk3 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk3\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         499.2 GB   disk3s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk3s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS Time Machine            1.5 TB     disk3s4\n\nThe external hard drive is the /dev/disk3. The first 3 partitions are an exact copy of /dev/disk0 at the time I did the clone. The last partition Time Machine was later created with the free disk space that was left.\nI can't mount /dev/disk3s2 inside macOS although I can do that when using Ubuntu. Am I missing something? What should I do to mount this partition?\nUpdate\nFrom what I've understood the problem happens because both /dev/disk0s2 + /dev/disk3s2 and /dev/disk0s3 + /dev/disk3s3 shares the same disk label. My /Volumes/Macintosh HD lists the Macbook filesystem itself, ie. it's the /dev/disk1 (from /dev/disk0s2).\nActually this happens because both disk GPT GUID and partitions GPT GUIDs share the same UUIDs. I still haven't found a way or tool to change those partitions GUIDs safely (where I can mount them without compromising their data).\n\nA: I have tested your set-up in a virtual machine with the same result - the second CoreStorage volume won't be mounted. Cloning a CoreStorage container to another disk with dd doesn't change the UUIDs of the CoreStorage items. So it's indeed a problem of the duplicate UUIDs of the Logical Volume Group/Physical Volume/Logical Volume Family/Logical Volume of disk0s2 and disk3s2.\nThe good news is: there is a man entry for a tool which can change the UUIDs of all CoreStorage metadata objects: man csunique.\nCheck the disk identifier of the duplicate with diskutil list. In your example that's disk3s2.\nThen the command in your case would be:\ncsunique -v -n /dev/rdisk3s2 #dry-run\ncsunique -v /dev/rdisk3s2\n\nThe bad news is: I can't find the tool/script. It's neither in the path nor can I find a file with this name elsewhere on the disk. I checked this in 10.9/10.10/10.11/Recovery HD by searching the whole disk even inside packages with FileBuddy. A Google search wasn't successful.\n\nWork in progress\nYou may change the various UUIDs manually by editing the raw disk content with a tool like HexEdit or wxHexEditor of course. AFAIR the pvUUID and the lvgUUID are located at the first block of disk3s2. The pvUUID/lvgUUID has several additional occurrences in the metadata area of the Logical Volume Group of disk3s2. Don't use arbitrary (ie self-made) UUIDs but try to generate them with uuidgen or online with a UUID generator. Some bits of the UUID have a special meaning and determine UUID version or the hash algorithm.\nExample:\nThe diskutil cs list output of the original disk:\ndiskutil cs list\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group C451C0F6-32F9-43AB-8E59-42D21AEFF650\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         SystemCS\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         67859718144 B (67.9 GB)\n    Free Space:   18948096 B (18.9 MB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume E46EF8F2-6399-45C1-B213-8628A518466D\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk0s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     67859718144 B (67.9 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family AAD268A6-FC66-43FC-A24E-11A1F23CA5DD\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n        Encryption Type:         None\n        Conversion Status:       NoConversion\n        Conversion Direction:    -none-\n        Has Encrypted Extents:   No\n        Fully Secure:            No\n        Passphrase Required:     No\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume 50B61719-7CB4-40D9-8AFC-F5CD37C1A66C\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:                  disk3\n            Status:                Online\n            Size (Total):          67488448512 B (67.5 GB)\n            Conversion Progress:   -none-\n            Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)\n            LV Name:               SystemCS\n            Volume Name:           SystemCS\n            Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\nThe pvUUID (light violet) and lvgUUID (light yellow) appear in hex in the first block and the last block of the partition:\n1st block:\n\nlast block:\n\nand as text each four times in the last 32760 blocks (512 byte physical block size) of the partition in plist-like items.\n\n\nA: Since the partitions were created with Linux, and accessible in Linux, why not use Linux to change the miscreant UUID?\nHow to Change the UUID of a Linux Partition (adapt to your needs and values)\nDuplicated UUID’s can be a big problem on your machine. But luckily it is easy to change the UUID of a Linux partition and can be done in roughly 1-2 minutes!\nThe UUID of a Linux partition is the Universally Unique IDentifier of that partition. I would say with a fair bit of confidence that in this and most scenarios, the Linux partition UUID has more of a local machine scope.\nThis ID is used in a few places to identify the partition. The most notable being your /etc/fstab file, which manages the mounting of partitions at boot time. Here is a little snippet from mine…\n1 # <file system>  <mount point>  <type>  <options>           <dump> <pass>\n2 proc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n3 # / was on /dev/sdc3 during installation\n4 UUID=9467f4de-4231-401f-bcaa-fee718d49e85 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n5 # swap was on /dev/sdb1 during installation\n6 UUID=aabe7e48-2d11-421f-8609-7ea9d75e7f9b none            swap    sw              0       0\n\n_\nWhy would you need to change a partition UUID?\nThe main reason being a clash of ID’s. Technically the likelihood of creating 2 identical UUID’s is very rare (read more on the Random UUID probability of duplicates). But there may be cases where you clone a partition using DD or Clonezilla and the clone resides on the same machine – different physical hard drive or partition.\nCloning using both the tools mentioned above will create an exact copy of the partition all the way down to the UUID – and now you have 2 partitions with the same UUID. From the example of my /etc/fstab above, the UUID is no longer unique and it will mount the first partition it finds with that UUID.\nHow do I change the UUID?\nThis isn’t hard at all. \n\n\n*\n\n*First find the device path.\n\n\nYou can find the device path using the following command:\nsudo blkid\n\nYour output will look something like this:\nsudo blkid\n/dev/sdb1: UUID=\"aabe7e48-2d11-421f-8609-7ea9d75e7f9b\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sdc1: UUID=\"9467f4de-4231-401f-bcaa-fee718d49e85\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sdc3: UUID=\"93a54a4a-e0f5-4152-ae59-2245e8d16ee4\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n/dev/sde5: UUID=\"9467f4de-4231-401f-bcaa-fee718d49e85\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sde6: LABEL=\"var\" UUID=\"30433f28-1b79-4b4d-9985-fef5b1c886b5\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nHere you can see that /dev/sdc1 and /dev/sde5 have the same UUID. The path of the partition I want to change is /dev/sde5\n\n\n*\n\n*Secondly, generate a UUID\n\n\nThis is simple, the following command will output a UUID like below:\nuuidgen\nf0acce91-a416-474c-8a8c-43f3ed3768f9\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Finally apply the new UUID to the partition\n\n\nThis is also another command, tune2fs, which will apply our new UUID to our device path:\nsudo tune2fs /dev/sde5 -U f0acce91-a416-474c-8a8c-43f3ed3768f9\n\nDone, now you can update your grub to include the correct UUID’s to reduce any risk of your system confusing the partitions.\n", "Q: No USB connected, receiving error message \"USB devices disabled: Unplug the device using too much power\" Recently I have been getting the error message \"USB devices disabled: Unplug the device using too much power almost constantly.

I have also tried restarting the computer, resetting the SMC, and scanning for any viruses using Avast Security, which found no issues. Nothing has helped.\nAnybody else having similar issues? Thank you for any help you can provide!\n\nA: This could be a hardware problem.\nYou have more things connected to USB than you are aware of.

I have a fairly large (40 MB) pdf file that is a version 1.6 PDF. The Preview app does not have a 'save as' option. Your choices under the file menu are: save, duplicate, rename, move to, export, and export as PDF. \n\nDuplicate makes a copy but it converts PDF from version 1.6 to 1.4 and this in itself reduces file size from 40 MB to 20 MB. 'Move To..' and 'Rename' have no noticeable effect on file or size.  Export has several options. The 'None' option, however, also converts file to PDF 1.4 from 1.6 again reducing file size to 20 MB.  Export to PDF does the same but file size is 19.5 MB. I'm confused on these differences. It appears just going from PDF 1.6 to PDF 1.4 cuts file size in half. Why is this and why the conversion in 1st place. The only way I know to truly make a copy is do it in Finder using cntrl-c. What info has been lost in going from PDF 1.6 to PDF 1.4? \n\nA: To get Save As... on the File menu in Preview, and many other apps as well, press the option key when clicking the menu.\nThe option key also modifies other commands on different menus as well.\n\nNote that the shift key also modifies commands in some cases.\n\nA: Each incremental PDF version is just a superset of the preceding version, which adds a few more features to the PDF language 'dictionary'. \nA list of the features in each PDF version can be found here.\nMacOS saves PDFs using the minimum PDF version required to contain the relevant features. So, if the image requires transparency, it will save to PDF version 1.4. If it doesn't, it will save to v1.3. Encrypting the PDF will raise its version level to 1.6. \nMacOS's PDF-creation routines also cannot reproduce all the features in every version of PDF. It cannot do 3D data, for example, which is found in 1.6 and 1.7.\nThere are many different ways in which the same 'page' can be represented in the PDF format. There are different methods of data compression. Whenever MacOS loads in PDF data and re-saves it, it will change the data stream and re-write the PDF. File copying (Move To.., Rename) will not do this. \nIn short, PDF file sizes can vary when the data is re-written. You may lose some metadata in the process, but the basic graphical page will be preserved.\n", "Q: Why Apple In-Ear headphones do not work with iPod Shuffle 3rd Generation?

In Photos on iOS 10.3.3, when I select one picture and open the share sheet, there’s an option to “Add to iCloud Drive”. But when I select multiple pictures, the share sheet doesn’t offer that option. Adding multiple pictures to iCloud Drive one by one gets rather tedious. Is there some way I can add multiple pictures at once? Perhaps by using another app?\n\nA: At present there is no easy way to do this, namely because Apple sees iCloud Photo Library and, depending on what you're trying to achieve, iCloud Photo Sharing as its iCloud solution regarding photos.\nHowever, it is highly likely that with iOS 11 and the change to the new Files app, that you'll be able to do what you want, as Files will work more like traditional (if that's the right word) cloud storage. More details will be revealed at Apple press event on 12 September 2017, so you haven't got long to wait.\nWorkaround\nThere is a bit of a messy workaround if you can't wait for iOS 11 or if your device isn't going to be compatible with iOS 11. This involves installing Apple's Workflow app and using it to Zip (i.e. 'make archive') of multiple photos and then move the zipped file into iCloud Drive.\n", "Q: Unknown \"Icon?\" file in Dropbox Stack I have a shortcut to my Dropbox folder on my dock.

Then click + at the bottom of the window, to add a new filter. The click the cogwheel or dropdown menu on the right-hand side of your filter.\n\nThen under \"Add Image Effects Components\", choose \"Color Image Sampling\", and optionally Image Compression.\n\nNote that you can't modify the existing system ones, but you can duplicate and modify them.\nThen select the Filter in Preview's Export:\n\n(NB: For some reason \"Export As PDF\" doesn't show the Filters, but Export, choosing PDF as the file format, does.)\n\nA: Preview is very limited in its capabilities.\n(Although @michalczukm's answer might well be worth a try for simple documents, e.g. those PDFs with not much structure, without Bookmarks. Also: while you may not visually discern any quality loss, it is still a lossy procedure, but with less aggressive settings then the original Quartz-filter.)\nInstead of Image Magick or Preview I suggest to try:\n\n*\n\n*Adobe Acrobat (expensive)\n\nor the libre/free\n\n*\n\n*GhostScript with the following parameters:\ngs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.7 -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -sOutputFile=Name_of_Outputfile.pdf  To_Reduce_Input.pdf\nYou may play with these settings. Those given here should not perform any lossy conversions or strip away important document structures. Meaning: most of the time the savings gained might be very good, but sometimes the file size even increases.\nGhostscript is available through a number of venues for macOS. The related muPDF is even available on the App Store.\nIf you created the PDF yourself then it would be obviously best to losslessly reduce the images before including them into the document (the PDF). Adjusting the image size in terms of pixel count/resolution appropriate for the intended output medium might produce the biggest savings.\n\nA: As per michalczukm answer, a quartz filter can solve this.  I had created my own and shared it on Github.  You can install it easily with a single command line.

I had a PDF of handwritten annotations on a book exported from Goodnotes. The Quartz Filter method didn't work for me, even when I applied a custom filter with aggressive settings. This makes me think that the filter is only applied to images in the PDF. In my case, the most aggressive filter reduced a PDF of size 104 MB to 103 MB!\nUsing Automator to Reduce PDF Size\nNote: This method works by converting pages in your PDF to compressed JPEGs and then stitching them back into a PDF, so other PDF data such as bookmarks and notes will be stripped.\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator.\n\n*Go to File > New and Choose Workflow.\n\n*Create the Workflow as follows.\n\n*\n\n*In the left pane, look for Ask for Finder Items and drag it to the right pane.\n\n*Next, add Render PDF Pages as Images and set the Compression and Resolution of the JPEGs.\n\n*Finally, add New PDF from Images.\n\n\n\n*Click on Run (top-right), choose your PDF and wait for Automator to do its job.\n\nIn my case, this reduced the file size to 10 MB.\nHere's a screenshot of my Workflow:\n\nThis answer is based on this answer on Apple communities.\n\nA: For someone who is not bothered by losing a bit of quality and if it is a single page document\nThese are the steps\n\n*\n\n*open the large size pdf, File -> Export -> Format (change to JPEG-2000) -> Quality (change to lossless) -> Resolution (change to 200 pixels/inch) -> Save\n\n\n*Now open the JPEG and export it as PDF.\nFor my file it reduced from 4MB to 700KB with negligible loss of quality.\n\nA: If you have a pdf which is version 1.6 or 1.7, you can use the duplicate setting in  Preview. Preview will save the file as a 1.4 pdf and save about 50% in file size. As far as I can tell there is no loss of quality. No need to use the export - reduced file size unless you want further savings. \n", "Q: Why do alternate web browsers want access to \"Chrome Safe Storage\" in my Keychain?

You may want to read What is the Chrome Safe Storage discussion at Vivaldi's forums.\n\n*More generally - There seems to be an issue recently where a number of apps are requesting access to Chrome Safe Storage. It's not just happening with browsers, but other apps too. I first noticed this in mid-July on an iMac running a 3rd party video downloader/converter. I'm not sure what changed, but some of these app developers have had to issue updates to remove this behaviour.\nIn terms of the info that's stored there - it's basically a secure location to store credentials such as passwords for sites you visit. \nThe advantages and disadvantages will differ depending on the app:\n\n\n*\n\n*in the case of browsers it will mean things like having to manually log in to sites you want to visit. Obviously the benefit is not having to do this.\n\n*in the case of other apps (such as the video downloader/converter I mention above), the user whose iMac had this issue could only convert videos, but not download them.

My MacBook Pro can undergo 1000 charge cycles (using up the battery completely and charging it back to 100%) before the battery's life is reduced to 80% of what it originally was.\nObviously, using high brightness while the computer is plugged in speeds up the rate of battery discharge, causing you to plug in the computer sooner and thus use up charge cycles faster. However, if I were to increase the computer's brightness during charging, or up the energy usage in any other way, wouldn't the process of charging slow down, the time between charge cycles would increase, and thus the long-term battery life would increase?\nIn other words, does increasing energy usage during charging actually increase battery life?\n\nA: The short answer is no, although this depends on what you mean by battery life.\nYou are correct that placing more of a burden on your computer while it's being charged (e.g. upping the brightness level, converting videos, etc) will result in a longer charging time (how much will differ on what your MBP is doing at the time).\nHowever, this doesn't increase the life of the battery itself. Of course, in terms of a human measurement of time (in terms of hours/days/weeks etc) there may be a perceived difference in the life of the battery, but the battery itself isn't lasting any longer in terms of its actual usage. \nPut another way, it's common that two users buying the exact same model MBP with the exact same specs will have a different experience in terms of how long it is before they need to replace the battery. But one user may use their MBP on the road etc every day, while the other only uses it a few hours every couple of days. Or one user spends a lot of time compressing video, while the other only does basic browsing and word processing. The fact that one of these users may need to replace their battery in a couple of years doesn't mean the battery life was less, just that its battery life was used up sooner than the other.\nFor further info you may want to read the entirety of what Apple says about their batteries here. \n", "Q: If a downloaded package verifies, is it safe?

I downloaded the .dmg file anyway; when I open it, Finder spends some time verifying it and then I have the option to install it.\nHow can I know whether it's safe to install?\n\nA: You don't know.\nThe finder just checks the disk image is a valid disk image. \nTo check that what you have downloaded matches what is on the server you need to do more checking. A common way is to calculate a hash on the downloaded data and compare with a hash published by the internet site. \nThen how do you know that the app you have downloaded won't format your disk? Again you don't You have to use your judgement as to whether the publisher is trustworthy enough. \nIf you went to Oracle's page directly or via a link from a trustable source then ok but if from a link from a mail from someone who has never sent you a mail before then probably not a good idea. \n", "Q: Apple Hardware Test doesn't run with original disk I have the original disks to my Macbook Pro mid-2010.

You can download it directly from Apple here.\n\n*Create a bootable USB flash drive by using Disk Utility's Erase function. Make sure you choose OS X Extended for the format and the GUID Partition Map for the scheme.\n\n*Now have a good read of the Run AHT from bootable USB stick section on this github page, as this provides the instructions for copying the AHT onto your USB drive and blessing it so it can boot your MBP.\n\n\nNOTE: By following steps 1 and 2 above you have already done the first and third bullet points on the github page.\nLet me know how you go. \n", "Q: iPhone 7 not turning on automatically while charging Sometimes when I put my iPhone to charge when its dead; it comes on automatically when it is charging, and sometimes I have to physically turned it on. \nFor example, last night I was on my iPhone, at it died.

I have homebrew's php70 installed and successfully connecting to apache via a unix domain socket.\nI had to use sudo to start php though: sudo brew services start php70.\nIf I don't do this, the socket is created under my regular user account name, rather than with owner _www,  the latter being essential to allow apache to access the socket. \nShould I be starting php70 as root like this, or is there a safer way?\nI tried creating a group with my own user name and apache as members of it, with intention of creating the socket under that group, but gave up as not entirely sure on the right track.\nAm I wasting my time trying to avoid use of sudo?   Maybe the answer is just .. 'it depends'.. ?\n\nA: The command (sudo) brew services start php70 (or better (sudo) brew services start homebrew/php/php70) copies a special plist to a distinctive folder and launches and starts it as a launch agent or daemon.\nWithout the sudo prefix it's copied to the $USER's LaunchAgents folder (~/Library/LaunchAgents/) and started with $USER rights.\nWith the sudo prefix, the plist is copied to /Library/LaunchDaemons and started with root rights. It will launch several processes (one parent root php70-fpm and several child _www php-fpm processes).\nOnly the latter will and can create a UNIX socket file with the owner _www.\nThis is the expected behavior.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to switch between Application tabs Applications typically have tabs like so:\n\nIs there a way to make a keyboard shortcut that switches between them?

After waiting several hours with no change, I turned the machine off, and rebooted.  I was met with the flashing question mark on a folder icon.\nThe Mac has the Apple RAID card in it, and 4 1TB drives.\nPressing any of the startup commands during boot does nothing; I still get the flashing icon.  CommandR doesn't work.  C doesn't work.  The only two that do anything is CommandOptionPR (reset NVRAM) and Option (Startup Disc select).  However, even when using those two, they still result in a flashing question mark icon.\nAny clues?  I'm wondering if the RAID card went bad or something.  It was complaining of a bad battery.\n\nA: A flashing question mark means it can't find system software, however, it is able to find the boot volume.  If the boot volume is on the RAID array, then it's not the RAID card.  \nTry booting from installation media to see if you can see the drive.  If you can see the volume and mount it, you can recover your data.\nAs for the RAID battery, it keeps the last last set of write commands in the controllers memory in case there is a power failure.

My brother has Down Syndrome, and spends most of the day using his iPad.  He uses Clips to make little videos.  They are just local to the iPad -- he never publishes them, and in fact does not have any social media, e-mail, or other accounts at all.  This is probably key to my question.\nHe has a Clips project with about a dozen clips, and we wanted to move one clip to another family member's iPhone.  To be clear, we didn't want to export/publish/send the project, just the one clip in the project.  As best as I could tell, this action is impossible or at least very well hidden.  Here's what I ran into:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you select a clip, the export button disappears.  That leads me to believe that you can only export the entire project.\n\n*You can \"favorite\" a clip, but that also does not seem to offer any new export options.\n\n*Any attempt to export the entire project seemed to require an account of some kind (YouTube, iMessage, etc.), which for privacy reasons we don't want to set up on that iPad.  I just want to move the file between machines, locally.\n\n*I would have tried the method in #3, but when connecting the iPad to the MacBook, I ran into yet another probably unrelated problem in that, even though the iPad is fully set up, registered with iCloud, and has been used for weeks, iTunes only offered to Restore or Set Up as New iPad when I plugged it in.  This led me to believe that either option would have erased everything.\n\n\nSo in short, how do I export/move a clip (not a project) from Clips to another iPhone (or to an iPhone indirectly via our MacBook), without deleting the rest of the clips in the project, or creating some kind of account on the iPad?\n\nA: I'm using Apple Clips version 1.1 - you can save individual clips to the Photo Library on your iPad. From there you can AirDrop it or share it in another way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the clip\n\n*Save to Photo Library\n\n*Share from the Photos app\n\n\n\n\nA: I’ve run into this too and so I know it’s frustrating. I’m going to try the answer recommended https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/297512/160704 but another alternative is to duplicate the entire project, remove all the clips you don’t want to export and then download the project, which at this point will just consist of the single clip.

Some email messages shows a paperclip in both message browser and in the opened email window.  Those allow Remove Attachments.  However some email messages only show a paperclip in the center hover toolbar in the opened email viewer, not in the message browser.  Those ones have Remove Attachments greyed-out.  Is there a way to remove attachments (as shown by the paperclip toolbar) from those emails messages?  Why is there a difference between the two types of attachments?\n\nA: The Messages > Remove Attachments selection is greyed-out unless you have selected (in the Mail message viewer) one or more emails which contain attachments. Select one or more emails which contain attachments and the selection will be available.\n", "Q: Does macOS have /usr/bin/env? I'm just wondering if macOS has /usr/bin/env.

Each name=value option specifies the\n     setting of an environment variable, name, with a value of value.  All\n     such environment variables are set before the utility is executed.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -i      Execute the utility with only those environment variables speci-\n             fied by name=value options.  The environment inherited by env is\n             ignored completely.\n\n     -P altpath\n             Search the set of directories as specified by altpath to locate\n             the specified utility program, instead of using the value of the\n             PATH environment variable.\n\n     -S string\n             Split apart the given string into multiple strings, and process\n             each of the resulting strings as separate arguments to the env\n             utility.  The -S option recognizes some special character escape\n             sequences and also supports environment-variable substitution, as\n             described below.\n\n     -u name\n             If the environment variable name is in the environment, then\n             remove it before processing the remaining options.  This is simi-\n             lar to the unset command in sh(1).  The value for name must not\n             include the `=' character.\n\n     -v      Print verbose information for each step of processing done by the\n             env utility.  Additional information will be printed if -v is\n             specified multiple times.\n\n     The above options are only recognized when they are specified before any\n     name=value options.\n\n     If no utility is specified, env prints out the names and values of the\n     variables in the environment, with one name/value pair per line.\n\n   Details of -S (split-string) processing\n     The processing of the -S option will split the given string into separate\n     arguments based on any space or <tab> characters found in the string.\n     Each of those new arguments will then be treated as if it had been speci-\n     fied as a separate argument on the original env command.\n\n     Spaces and tabs may be embedded in one of those new arguments by using\n     single (``''') or double (`\"') quotes, or backslashes (`\\').  Single\n     quotes will escape all non-single quote characters, up to the matching\n     single quote.  Double quotes will escape all non-double quote characters,\n     up to the matching double quote.  It is an error if the end of the string\n     is reached before the matching quote character.\n\n     If -S would create a new argument that starts with the `#' character,\n     then that argument and the remainder of the string will be ignored.  The\n     `\\#' sequence can be used when you want a new argument to start with a\n     `#' character, without causing the remainder of the string to be skipped.\n\n     While processing the string value, -S processing will treat certain char-\n     acter combinations as escape sequences which represent some action to\n     take.  The character escape sequences are in backslash notation.  The\n     characters and their meanings are as follows:\n\n           \\c      Ignore the remaining characters in the string.  This must\n                   not appear inside a double-quoted string.\n           \\f      Replace with a <form-feed> character.\n           \\n      Replace with a <new-line> character.\n           \\r      Replace with a <carriage return> character.\n           \\t      Replace with a <tab> character.\n           \\v      Replace with a <vertical tab> character.\n           \\#      Replace with a `#' character.  This would be useful when\n                   you need a `#' as the first character in one of the argu-\n                   ments created by splitting apart the given string.\n           \\$      Replace with a `$' character.\n           \\_      If this is found inside of a double-quoted string, then\n                   replace it with a single blank.  If this is found outside\n                   of a quoted string, then treat this as the separator char-\n                   acter between new arguments in the original string.\n           \\\"      Replace with a <double quote> character.\n           \\'      Replace with a <single quote> character.\n           \\\\      Replace with a backslash character.\n\n     The sequences for <single-quote> and backslash are the only sequences\n     which are recognized inside of a single-quoted string.  The other\n     sequences have no special meaning inside a single-quoted string.  All\n     escape sequences are recognized inside of a double-quoted string.  It is\n     an error if a single `\\' character is followed by a character other than\n     the ones listed above.\n\n     The processing of -S also supports substitution of values from environ-\n     ment variables.  To do this, the name of the environment variable must be\n     inside of `${}', such as: ${SOMEVAR}.  The common shell syntax of\n     $SOMEVAR is not supported.  All values substituted will be the values of\n     the environment variables as they were when the env utility was origi-\n     nally invoked.  Those values will not be checked for any of the escape\n     sequences as described above.  And any settings of name=value will not\n     effect the values used for substitution in -S processing.\n\n     Also, -S processing can not reference the value of the special parameters\n     which are defined by most shells.  For instance, -S can not recognize\n     special parameters such as: `$*', `$@', `$#', `$?' or `$$' if they appear\n     inside the given string.\n\n   Use in shell-scripts\n     The env utility is often used as the interpreter on the first line of\n     interpreted scripts, as described in execve(2).\n\n     Note that the way the kernel parses the `#!' (first line) of an inter-\n     preted script has changed as of FreeBSD 6.0.  Prior to that, the FreeBSD\n     kernel would split that first line into separate arguments based on any\n     whitespace (space or <tab> characters) found in the line.  So, if a\n     script named /usr/local/bin/someport had a first line of:\n\n           #!/usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafe_mode=0\n\n     then the /usr/local/bin/php program would have been started with the\n     arguments of:\n\n           arg[0] = '/usr/local/bin/php'\n           arg[1] = '-n'\n           arg[2] = '-q'\n           arg[3] = '-dsafe_mode=0'\n           arg[4] = '/usr/local/bin/someport'\n\n     plus any arguments the user specified when executing someport.  However,\n     this processing of multiple options on the `#!' line is not the way any\n     other operating system parses the first line of an interpreted script.\n     So after a change which was made for FreeBSD 6.0 release, that script\n     will result in /usr/local/bin/php being started with the arguments of:\n\n           arg[0] = '/usr/local/bin/php'\n           arg[1] = '-n -q -dsafe_mode=0'\n           arg[2] = '/usr/local/bin/someport'\n\n     plus any arguments the user specified.  This caused a significant change\n     in the behavior of a few scripts.  In the case of above script, to have\n     it behave the same way under FreeBSD 6.0 as it did under earlier\n     releases, the first line should be changed to:\n\n           #!/usr/bin/env -S /usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafe_mode=0\n\n     The env utility will be started with the entire line as a single argu-\n     ment:\n\n           arg[1] = '-S /usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafe_mode=0'\n\n     and then -S processing will split that line into separate arguments\n     before executing /usr/local/bin/php.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     The env utility uses the PATH environment variable to locate the\n     requested utility if the name contains no `/' characters, unless the -P\n     option has been specified.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The env utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.  An exit\n     status of 126 indicates that utility was found, but could not be exe-\n     cuted.  An exit status of 127 indicates that utility could not be found.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Since the env utility is often used as part of the first line of an\n     interpreted script, the following examples show a number of ways that the\n     env utility can be useful in scripts.\n\n     The kernel processing of an interpreted script does not allow a script to\n     directly reference some other script as its own interpreter.  As a way\n     around this, the main difference between\n\n           #!/usr/local/bin/foo\n     and\n           #!/usr/bin/env /usr/local/bin/foo\n\n     is that the latter works even if /usr/local/bin/foo is itself an inter-\n     preted script.\n\n     Probably the most common use of env is to find the correct interpreter\n     for a script, when the interpreter may be in different directories on\n     different systems.  The following example will find the `perl' inter-\n     preter by searching through the directories specified by PATH.\n\n           #!/usr/bin/env perl\n\n     One limitation of that example is that it assumes the user's value for\n     PATH is set to a value which will find the interpreter you want to exe-\n     cute.  The -P option can be used to make sure a specific list of directo-\n     ries is used in the search for utility.  Note that the -S option is also\n     required for this example to work correctly.\n\n           #!/usr/bin/env -S -P/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin perl\n\n     The above finds `perl' only if it is in /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin.  That\n     could be combined with the present value of PATH, to provide more flexi-\n     bility.  Note that spaces are not required between the -S and -P options:\n\n           #!/usr/bin/env -S-P/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:${PATH} perl\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n     The env utility accepts the - option as a synonym for -i.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     printenv(1), sh(1), execvp(3), environ(7)\n\nSTANDARDS\n     The env utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').  The -P,\n     -S, -u and -v options are non-standard extensions supported by FreeBSD,\n     but which may not be available on other operating systems.\n\nHISTORY\n     The env command appeared in 4.4BSD.  The -P, -S and -v options were added\n     in FreeBSD 6.0.\n\nBUGS\n     The env utility does not handle values of utility which have an equals\n     sign (`=') in their name, for obvious reasons.\n\n     The env utility does not take multibyte characters into account when pro-\n     cessing the -S option, which may lead to incorrect results in some\n     locales.\n\nBSD                             April 17, 2008                             BSD\n\n", "Q: Take screenshots without power button I have an iPhone 5s that I got from a friend & the power button is extremely hard, next to impossible to push is.

As a iOS user and not a programmer, I managed to find out from some posts I could understand, that iOS apps can keep data between instalations on Keychain, iCloud or Dropbox. \nPinterest never asked for access on iCloud, Dropbox or similar cloud storage. I suppose it stocks login data in Keychain and do not delete it when uninstalling. \nPlease help me to understand: is it a local keychain that iOS apps can use, different from iCloud Keychain? Is it so that only the iCloud Keychain could be user enabled / disabled, the local keychain beeing an always on iOS feature that every app developer can use whithout requesting user permission? \nI ask this because I never enabled iCloud Keychain on any of my iOS devices. Or does Pinterest app use other iOS feature that I don't read about to retain log in credentials?\n\nA: iOS apps can keep important data (like login credentials) in the local Keychain. It is not the same keychain as the iCloud Keychain. iCloud Keychain is located in iCloud. Local keychain is located on your device, will never leave your device, only when you backup your iOS device and only when those backups are encrypted.\nWhen you delete an app from your iOS device, there isn't really a uninstall procedure that also deletes keychain data. \nWhat you could try is to sign off in Pinterest before you delete the app. If the Pinterest app is developed properly the sign off function should delete the login credentials. (not sure about it)\n", "Q: IPad Pro out of battery and won't charge I just bought a new Moshi line to charge my iPad, it was working fine at first but yesterday it said something like unlicensed line and when i saw it i didn't really care and just pressed dismissed. When i woke up my iPad didn't charge. Now my iPad is completely out of battery and when i plugged it in the charger it showed that it was charging but i can turn it on. I change lines several times and it still wouldn't  work.\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure what Moshi line is, other than a lightning cable. What Gen is this iPad? The problem may be with the cord, the hot wire, or the bar wire could be soldered wrong. There's only one fix for this, a messy project in taking the cord apart by the Male Piece. You'd have to re solder it, and make sure it's a sturdy fix. An other problem may be the charging port, when did you buy this iPad, is it brand new? Apple isn't known for soft error's like a wire misplace, but it could happen with any company. I've dealt with Phillips and a missing wire before, this could also be the case.\n\nA: Press the Home and Standby button simultaneously for at least ten seconds.

I've got a 2011 MacbookPro 2011 with miniDisplay port, and a I Recently bought this beautiful monitor: Asus VS248HR Gaming Monitor \nI currently have a VGA adaptor, and even though that is a really nice monitor, it doesn't seem like one over the VGA connection type; therefore I would like to buy a HDMI adaptor and connect my new monitor over HDMI.\nI've found several cheap adaptors on amazon, but a couple of questions bug my head:\n\n\n*\n\n*One: can I possibly have a good resolution/overall good vision performance if I use one of those cheap HDMI adaptors you can find on Amazon, or I need to buy the more expensive Apple one?\n\n*Second question: will my resolution improve after connecting the new monitor over HDMI?\nThank you guys\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro is officially capable of displaying an external resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels. Using a HDMI cable is not going to improve on this.\nAs far as the type of MiniDisplay port > HDMI adapter you opt for, we can't comment on one of those cheap HDMI adaptors you can find on Amazon as there are countless cheap adapters around and you'd really have to specify a specific model. However, what I can tell you is:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't need to buy the more expensive Apple one.\n\n*You should opt for a reputable well known brand if you're not going to buy an Apple one, not just a cheap and nasty brand you've never heard of before, as the quality of cable/connector can make a real difference.\n\n\nA: It is impossible to predict the improvement you may get from switching to an all-digital signal from your Mac to your monitor. It is reasonable to assume that there will be an improvement but depending on your eyesight and the monitor's electronics you may or may not see an improvement.\nAnd, generally speaking, as long as a cable or adaptor meets the specifications called for a brand name cable/adaptor is generally no different than a generic brand adaptor.\nNote that sometimes a generic product will not be as well constructed as the Apple one. meaning it might fail sooner than the Apple one. But certainly not always.\nRule of thumb I go by is how much are you saving? If the generic product is half (or less) of the cost of the brand name one it might be worth it (assuming the quality isn't shite) if it's only a couple of bucks spring for the brand name.\n", "Q: Can I take a screenshot on one Mac and instantly paste it into a document on another Mac or iPad? I’ve recently started using Universal Clipboard across my Macs, iPads and iPhones. So far it works very well and I’m very happy with it. \nMy one complaint is that my work requires me to take a lot of screenshots for placing into documents. My current workflow involves me taking the screenshot on one Mac and then having to transfer it to another device. At present I use a mixture of file sharing, AirDrop and iMessage for doing this, but it would be so cool if I could just take the screenshot on the Mac and then paste it into a document on another Mac, iPad or iPhone. \nIs it possible to take a screenshot on one Mac and paste it into another device using Universal Clipboard?\n\nA: Yes! There is a way for you to do this. In fact, it’s probably the main thing I use Universal Clipboard for!\nIn a nutshell, when you’re taking screenshots on your Mac they’re instantly saved onto your drive (typically on the Desktop). The problem with this is that they’re not captured onto your clipboard, and therefore they’re not available for pasting on your other devices. \nTo get around this all you need to do is add the control key to whatever keyboard shortcut you’re using to take your screenshots.\nExample\nFor example, if you’re using the commandshift4 keyboard shortcut to take a screenshot of an area you’re selecting with the mouse cursor, then you’d use the controlcommandshift4 keyboard shortcut instead.\nBy adding the control key you’re capturing the screenshot directly onto your clipboard and can then instantly paste it into documents on your other devices, including your iPhone.\nNOTE: For this to work, both devices must meet the Continuity requirements. For details, refer to Copy and paste across devices. \n", "Q: Does TimeMachine backup iCloud Drive files? Does TimeMachine backup the files I have in iCloud Drive? I want to use iCloud Drive more for files I don't use a lot. But it is important that there is a regular backup.\n\nA: iCloud Drive is a folder located in the Library folder: ~/Library/MobileDocuments.\nThis folder will be back-upped but there are a few strings attached to it:\n\n\n*\n\n*As long as the files are stored locally it will be backed up. \n\n*When there is a cloud icon next to the file it means it's stored in the cloud and not longer locally. It will not been backed up.\n\n\nA: Yes, it does. Technically, the iCloud Drive folder is located here:\n~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com\\~apple\\~CloudDocs\n\nwith ~/Library referring to the (hidden) Library folder inside your user home folder. As Time Machine backs up all of the user’s home folders (except for some standard exclusions like Caches) it will also back up your iCloud Drive.\n\nA: Time Machine does back up files in your iCloud Drive unless you exclude them (in Time Machine settings). Even if the files have a cloud icon next to them (not stored locally), it downloads the file during backup and stores a copy. \n", "Q: Automator: Filter Finder Items selecting wrong files I wanted an Automator folder action to automatically remove old downloads from my downloads folder whenever I download a new file (I wanted to avoid making this a scheduled job).\nThe workflow looks like this:\n\nWhen I test it, it works fine - selecting only files older than 60 days. However when I actually download a new file to the downloads folder it sends the new file to the trash.\nWhat gives? Is the timestamp on the new file not correct until after the download finishes or something?\nEDIT: I discovered that it deletes the file being added to the folder no matter what. Meaning - if I drag and drop a new file to the folder, the workflow deletes it even though the time stamp is from today.\n\nA: Finder uses the kMagicBusyCreationDate for files currently being downloaded, which is 08:34:56 on 1946-02-14 (+0000).\n\nUse this date as a file's or folder's creation date to indicate that it is temporarily busy (while it is being downloaded or installed, for example).\n\nWhat is the significance of 1946-02-14 08:34:56?\nAs this is well outside your date range, the file is removed immediately. Therefore you can’t use any date based checks whilst files are being downloaded.\n\nA: Here is a solution to bypass Automator completely. Just save this script in the Script Editor.App to your /Users/your_shortname/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions folder.

As a feature this is pretty neat, it simplifies searching for past pictures much easier. In addition to this the logic can detect people from pictures and even identify them.\nHowever I am concerned about the privacy factor. I have not enabled iCloud Photos sharing. Yet when I take new photo of an apple in Airplane mode, the search finds it as \"fruit\" only after I have enabled Internet access again. This means that Apple is sending my images (or some derivates of them) to their servers to be processed.\nI haven't found any source that explain exactly what happens there, so I can only guess. \nDoes Apple really send photos to their servers or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: Not seeing this behaviour.\nI put my iPhone into Airplane Mode, took a picture of a coffee cup. When I tapped the search icon in Photos, at the bottom, saw an \"Indexing\" spinner for a while (less than a minute). After that, search on \"cup\" found the picture. Repeated with a photo of a candle, same behaviour.\nMaybe you should wait a bit longer. \n", "Q: How do I force TextEdit to not add .txt extension (Sierra) I have TextEdit default to plain text files.

And what is the point of that box in \"Preferences\" if it doesn't actually do anything?\n\nA: Don't use the name in the title bar to change or set the file name. Use the file menu option save, or hold the option key and select save as.  This lets you chose your extension name. I encountered a similar problem using title bar to name the file.\n", "Q: Managing a large number of parallel iCloud accounts I manage a large number (over 50) of unique iCloud accounts each with unique information, contacts, and an attached iPhone.\nCurrently any changes among the group's information has to be edited in manually, with contacts being the primary offender for time usage as I delete and then upload vCards for each account through the iCloud website.\nIs there any workaround that Ask Different users know of? Any program that you have used or tried that could alleviate a bit of this workload?\nEdit: As for clarification as to the system we have in place currently: we manage a number of field agents who need to be able to manage their own phone contacts on a parallel phone-by-phone basis, but all of the agents need to be able to contact one another, and the contact information among the agents changes frequently. It is a pain to update all of them manually through the current system we have in place. (iCloud) The number of agents we employ shifts with time, and we often deactivate phones and accounts, or even activate new ones, which would require an update to all of the phones' iCloud accounts, deleting outdated contacts and replacing them with the updated vCards. It feels as if there is a solution that could work better, but we have not been able to find it.\n\nA: iCloud is hard to manage in enterprise setting. Even with Apple's own macOS server it is hard to manage this kind of thing. A better environment would be Office365 or Google Apps. In both systems it's really easy to manage large numbers of accounts. And add content to for example contacts.\nIf you really want to stick to iCloud. Make an Automator action would be the solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to an account\n\n*Delete content\n\n*Upload new content\n\n*Repeat with next account\n\n\nFurther more I highly recommand to give feedback on this matter to Apple.\n", "Q: Is there a Google Calendar app for Mac desktop? I want to know if there is a Google Calendar app for the Mac desktop? I do not want to sync my Google Calendar to my Apple calendar. I want to have the Google Calendar app itself on my Mac. Has Google made this?\n\nA: Google haven’t made a desktop calendar app. You can add your Google account to Internet Accounts in macOS which will allow you to access your Google calendar in Calendar.app without syncing it with your iCloud account. Alternatively you can use Fantastical which also supports Google Calendar.\n\nA: Just use the WebCatalog macOS app. Create a new Google Calendar app, sign in as you normally would, and then in the Preferences select 'Remember last page visited' so you don't have to sign in again. I run a number of Google and other services like this as one-off apps.\n\nA: Aside from Apple's own Calendar.app (nee iCal), there's also the aforementioned Fantastical as well as the excellent BusyCal.  Neither will by default synch between different accounts.\nThis Google Help article may also provide some guidance.\n", "Q: mkdir: /Users/me/.bash_sessions: Permission denied When I open terminal now I get always this error message.

Even though the Mail app. does not open, at Apple they told me there is nothing I can do and I will lose all email that I have on my Mac. I have very important data in my emails.\nDoes anyone have a suggestion?\n\nA: Any email you have stored on your Mac from your Mail app is located in your user account's library folder. More specifically, in macOS Sierra you can access your mail data as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you're in the Finder\n\n*Press and hold the option key\n\n*Click on the Go menu and select Library\n\n*Your user account's Library folder will open (you can now let go of the option key) \n\n*Within this folder is located a Mail folder. This contains any Mail data actually stored on your Mac.\n\n\nNow, assuming you have Time Machine backups, all of this should already be backed up. However, if you don't, then you could copy this Mail folder onto a couple of USB drives for safe keeping until you sort out your Mail app issue.\nNOTE: It's not clear from your question how you upgraded to macOS Sierra, nor what type of email account you have. As a result, we cannot advise how much data, if any, you have in your Mail folder.\n", "Q: What can someone access on my iPhone if they set up their iCloud account on my device?

I bought a 2014 late Mac mini today from a shop where it was a test device. It has been registered but I got it cheaper. My problem is: it has macOS Sierra installed on it, which runs very slow, and the finder seems to be messed up. It does not show any file content.\nMac mini specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: Dual-core i5 1.4 GHz\n\n*RAM: 4 GB\n\n*HDD: 500 GB\n\n\nAre current Mac mini devices shipped with Sierra, or it has been upgraded from El Capitan? It has been registered in 15 May 2017. Is this model fully and sufficiently compatible with macOS Sierra?\n\nA: I would suggest re-installing the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version. This can be accomplished by pressing and holding Command-R immediately after pressing the power button to turn on your Mac mini.\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\n", "Q: Install second operating system on internal (as VM with Parallels) or external drive? I am using an old MacBook and I want to keep my operating system. For coding with Xcode I would need a newer version of OS X.\nMy question is, if the performance is better when I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the new operating system on internal HDD via Parallels.\n\n*Install it on an extern HDD and boot the laptop from there.\n\n\nI just want to code in Xcode so the only thing that matters to me is performance.\n\nA: A native OS is always faster than one running in a virtual machine. \nThat would seem to be obvious, so edit your Question if I am misunderstanding you, or if you had other issues or complications in mind. If your external drive or connection is slow, then booting to external might be about the same as the VM on internal drive, or even worse if using a USB 2 drive/connection. On a Thunderbolt drive, you will be running faster than than will the VM on internal.\nOn the other hand, I have successfully done Xcode programming in a VM in Parallels. The performance is surprisingly good. \nThere are always niggly glitches and bugs in Parallels, and always changing version to version as some get fixed while new ones appear. But I've encountered no showstoppers, just annoyances. The most serious bug suffered by me and reported by others is that the mouse suddenly and inexplicably becomes useless within the VM. The workaround is to suspend and restore the VM. Takes about 10-20 seconds, and solves the problem reliably, but is quite annoying. \nCurrently, there are still issues with trying to run the VM in Retina mode. While it generally works well enough, it really slows down performance noticeably. And a few apps malfunction, misinterpreting the resolution, causing the content of their windows to be dramatically zoomed in, rendering the app unusable. In addition to some web browsers, this happens in the Xcode Simulator. Workaround is to shutoff Retina mode in your VM’s settings. \nAnother benefit of a VM is keeping Apple's confusing array of settings and security certificates in Keychain all stored nicely in the VM and kept separate from your own stuff on your real Mac. If doing a clean install or moving to a fresh Mac, would you know how to move all the pieces needed to keep Xcode and iTunesConnect happy?\n", "Q: Are Mac OS X services name sensitive?

Because Apple don't allow Apps in their store that implement their own web rendering engines (aka browsers). Therefore every 'browser' currently available on the App store is just a skin on top of the built-in web render, which explicitly doesn't implement VP9 / webm support.\n", "Q: How to have Gnome-like ALT + TAB window manager? \n*\n\n*In Gnome using ALT + TAB you get a window manager to navigate to the child windows of Firefox or Google Chrome:\n\n\n*In macOS holding CMD + press TAB gives similar window manager but you cant navigate to the child window's of Firefox or Google chrome:\n\nIs there any similar macOS tool like Gnome's?\nI hear https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch but not sure if it's like Gnome.

I did and tried again even no luck.\n\n\nPlease help me how to reinstall my Mac Pro please. \n\nA: My advice would be to boot back into OS X. Erase the USB stick and follow the commands given here using Terminal https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201372\nThis is Apple's method of doing it and I've found it far more reliable than using Disk Maker X or any drag and drop method. For clarity if your USB stick was formatted as Untitled, the command would look like this:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\nBecause you started the command with the word 'sudo' you will be asked to enter your user password, go ahead and do this and then wait. It can sometimes take up to an hour for this process to finish.\nNext make sure have a backup before you proceed to do anything. Time Machine to a USB hard drive of equal or greater size than your hard disk will be good enough.\nOnce the above steps are done, restart your machine with the memory stick inserted and turn the machine on while holding the alt(option) key. \nSelect the Mac OS Installer and follow the instructions. If you're going for just a reinstall over the top of your existing files, simply select re-install Mac OS and let it run.\nIf you're going for a completely clean install (recommended if you're having issues) make sure you have backup of your system first then proceed to use Disk Utility to format your main hard drive (best practice is to call it Macintosh HD).

This works great in zsh, but not in tmux.\nIn tmux opt+<- does jump backwords per word, but also seems to do some mode modification… when typing s afterwards, the character under the cursor will be deleted.\nI also have issues with cmd+-> (0x05) and cmd+<- (0x01) – in zsh those keys navigate to the end and the start of the line, but this doesn't work at all in tmux.\nI don't think there are any keybindings for these hex codes, so I assume something gets lost on the way from iTerm2 to tmux… Calling read in zsh directly and in tmux outputs the same codes for the opt bindings mentioned above, but it doesn't output anything for the cmd bindings in tmux.\nEdit:\nI experimented a little bit more and discovered that the bindings work fine when using /bin/bash in tmux and only break when using zsh in tmux. I even tested /bin/zsh without loading .zshrc to check if something is wrong with homebrews zsh, but the bindings are broken there too. It seems like this is actually an issue with zsh.\nEdit:\nMore experiments! This seems to be connected to the $TERM environment variable that is set to \"screen-256color\" by my .tmux.conf – this seems to be correct to get the colors working, but as soon as zsh runs with this environment variable, the navigation stops working. Running TERM=screen-256color zsh reproduces the issue.\n\nA: Seems like I finally found an answer! Or rather a workaround, since I'm still not sure what exactly is going wrong.\nExplicitly configuring the key binds for word navigation fixed the issue for me:\nbindkey \"^[f\" forward-word\nbindkey \"^[b\" backward-word\n\nMaybe zsh is using different keybindings based on $TERM.\n", "Q: 2017 Macbook-Pro did not want to turn on? I bought my Macbook pro about a month ago and have been liking it ever since. But today i had something really wierd happen to me! \n1 of the 4 USB-C ports were not letting me charge through it. After a while I wanted to restart the macbook because for some reason it was slow.

For a new laptop its quite wierd for you to not be able to start it up. Especially a 3500 euro macbook. \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The System Management Controller is a subsystem responsible for power management as well as fan control. It is not unusual for it to get into an undefined state. Power spikes, i. e. can occur at any time and may influence the SMC. \nSo the question is not why or when it happens but how to resolve it.

Therefore keep going with your MPB—there doesn’t appear to be any problem.\n", "Q: Disallow iOS version updates on iDevice Is there a way, with like a .mobileconfig profile or else, to disallow update of iOS version on a device? OTA or cable.\n\nA: You can disable OTA updates by installing the Apple TV beta profile on your iOS device. If you are an Apple Developer you can obtain the beta profile from the Downloads section. Installing this profile changes the software update catalog location to the one used for Apple TV updates, and therefore iOS reads the catalog and finds no updates suitable for iOS.\nIf your device is jailbroken, you can install NO PLS RECOVERY which prevents your device from entering recovery mode initiated by iTunes, preventing iTunes from updating the device.\nIt's not possible to prevent someone with physical access to the device from entering DFU using the buttons on the device and restoring iOS.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar not saving Screenshots I bought a new MacBook Pro and everything was running smoothly, but some days ago I noticed that the screenshots (command+shift+3) are not saving to the Desktop (it was working before), only saving to the clipboard.\n\n*\n\n*It is not a wrong shortcut since I can hear the screenshot sound.\n\n\n*I have already tried to Force Quit Finder or restart the Mac and none\nof these worked.\n\n\n*I have already tried this terminal command  defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/ and killall SystemUIServer but they didnt work as well.\n\n\n*I do not have DropBox Installed\nI am a developer so I install new dependencies every day, it may have changed some default configurations?\n\nA: Instead of using this terminal command  :\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/\n\nTry a different approach using this terminal command\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/yourusername/Desktop/\n\nObviously replace “yourusername” with your username\n\nA: I figured it out.

Then, if you did everything that I wrote at my question and nothing happened, probably this is your problem too. \nHow to solve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press command+shift+4, so your Touch Bar will look like the image above.\n\n*So, all you got to do is change the option that is selected at the Save to: section to Desktop.\n\n\nDoing this, both command+shift+3 and command+shift+4 will now save your Screen Shots to the Desktop.\n", "Q: Is it possible to access and modify iCloud keychain from command line (or automation) I am very aware how to access the keychain itself from the command line, what I seem to be unable to figure out, however, is if I can access the iCloud keychain from the command line as well.  Currently the only way I've been able to access it is via the Keychain Access tool.  \nThe situation I'm trying to deal with is that I have a password that changes weekly and I'm able to update the entry via command line in the System keychain, however the iCloud entry does not change.  When I try to connect to the Wi-Fi network it seems to use the iCloud password and then throws an error if it doesn't match. \n\nIf I manually remove the iCloud keychain entry via Keychain Access it will use the System keychain password.\nMy hope was to automate the removal of the iCloud keychain entry item via command line tools or manually editing some plist or something.\nAny help is appreciated.  Also if there is some funky way to use AppleScript to do this I'm all ears.\n\nA: iCloud Keychain is stored on disk in a different format than a traditional keychain ref1, ref2. It's located at ~/Library/Keychains/ in a folder named as a long UUID.

If root is not enabled for you, you might be able to use single user mode to accomplish a similar result (move or rename the existing home folder).\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7502209\nI had already tried resetting NVRAM and SMC. It turned out that the update to 10.11.4 didn't like my primary user account. I discovered this by successfully logging in as system administrator (root) while in Safe Boot mode. Root was already enabled using Directory Services.app (/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/). I needed to migrate my home folder to a new account. I logged in as root, then created a new user in Users and Groups prefpane. Then I used a combination of Terminal commands and the UI to replace the new user's home folder with the one I had used for the account into which I could not log in. This explanation may risk over-simplification, but what I did was this. While logged in as root, I deleted the former user  in Users and Groups leaving the home folder unchanged, deleted the new user's home folder, used the \"mv\" command to change the name of the old home folder to the name of the new user's home folder, then used a command something like \"chown -R new-user-name /Users/new-user-name\" to give the new user permissions to the stuff in the old folder. Then I was able to log in and use my stuff. I didn't worry too much about persistent caches, so I have a bit of cleaning up to do, but the old stuff is where it should be now and everything seems to be working.\n", "Q: MacBook 2017 (USB-C) to Apple Cinema Display 30\" I've seen many of the solutions on the topic, all posted in this site. But I haven't seen any of them mentioning Apple's adapter, Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter\nI have that, which was used to connect to my old MacBook Pro 2013. \nNow, I'm assuming that all I need is to connect the Mini DisplayPort to an adapter, such as AllSmartLife USB C Type to Mini DisplayPort/Mini DP Adapter (as mentioned in one of the posts) and the USB cable to a USB-C adaptor. \nIs this correct? \n\nA: When selecting an adapter, you have to know what sources you are going from to what you are going to.  One important thing to keep in mind is that you want to limit the number of conversions/connections you make; more conversions = less reliability.\nThe 2017 MacBook has just a single USB-C port.  However, it supports the following:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Charging\n  \n*USB 3.1 Gen 1 (up to 5 Gbps)\n  \n*Native DisplayPort 1.2 video output\n  \n*VGA output using USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter (sold separately)\n  \n*HDMI video output using USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (sold separately)\n  \n\n(Emphasis mine)\nThe Apple Cinema Display has a Dual Link DVI port.  \nSo, you need to go from USB-C DisplayPort to DualLink DVI Adapter like the Tripp-Lite U444-003-D (The product must indicate that it supports Dual-Link DVI or it won't work)\nKeep in mind, that this particular display is getting long-in-the-tooth so to speak and it will become increasingly difficult to find newer interfaces for older, unsupported monitors that has a small market share (Everybody had DVI, only a few could afford DL-DVI).\n\nA: I have the exact same problem and after much search, came to this solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual-Link DIV to DisplayPort using Apple's connector\n\n*DisplayPort to USB-C using this connector Which is a  USB-C to Mini-DisplayPort and Charging Port Adapter {Amazon.com}\n\n\nKeep in mind that the Cinema display also needs a USB-A connection (I'm guessing to provide power to some internal circuit for link negotiation?), so you'll need a separate adapter from USB-C to USB-A.\nI'm also an amateur photographer and shoots with a Canon 5DsR, editing my photos using an AdobeRGB LG 4K display (10-bit color to support AdobeRGB). I've also tested the DisplayPort adapter on this display and it works flawlessly.\nOn a side note - reason why you'll need a separate adapter for USB-A instead of having the USB-A built-in to the DisplayPort adapter is that only way for USB-C to support DisplayPort data-rate is using Display Protocol, which turns a bi-directional USB connection (10Gbit/direction) to a uni-directional output port (20Gbit total). If you work out the math: 3840 * 2160 * 10-bit color per channel * 3 color channels (RGB) * 60 Hz = 15Gbit/s.\n", "Q: How to find connected Device ID through iTunes I'd like to use iTunes to get information from an iPhone 7+. I'm a developer playing around with iOS development for the first time, and am trying to deploy a toy/hobby iOS app (that I wrote via XCode) to my iPhone.\nIt looks like the first thing I need to do is figure out what my iPhone's Device ID is.

Then you can simply tell the checkbox to turn on/off, or (as shown below) always turn on if it's currently off (value of checkbox is a boolean, thus can be directly used in an if statement).\nYou can simply save this script and execute it on the command line via osascript /my/path/to/the/script.scpt\".\nIt is important to note that I did not try every checkbox and further UI scripting may be necessary, e.g. where further options can be toggled or passwords are requested.\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to set current pane to pane \"iCloud\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell window \"iCloud\" of process \"System Preferences\"\n        set btmmBox to checkbox 1 of UI element 1 of row 11 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1\n        tell btmmBox\n            if not (its value as boolean) then click btmmBox\n        end tell\n        --get value of btmmBox\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How to lock the iPad's screen with a keyboard shortcut?

How can I avoid having to manually delete a photo on both devices for it to disappear? I'm not using iCloud sync.\n\nA: Without iCloud, the images are just imported, not synced. There's no tangible connection between the two. This the same behavior has you'd find with a camera's memory card.\nBefore iCloud, images were synced via iTunes. You can still sync images back to the iOS device via iTunes, but if you do that the iOS device can't delete them.\n", "Q: iPhone Keeps Asking for Other User iTunes Store Creds - Which Content is Causing this?

I suspect those are the problem.  I've tried deleting them from the library but they won't go away.\n\nA: I think you're on the right track.  If you checked every app and know for sure that it was downloaded from your iCloud account, then it's probably the music.  \nYou mentioned you used Family Sharing.  If you're the organizer, you can remove her from the group or disband the family group.  According to Apple:\n\nWhen you leave Family Sharing, your Apple ID is removed from the family group, and you stop sharing music, movies, TV shows, books, and apps with any remaining family members. In addition, any photos, calendars, and reminders shared by the family group will be removed from your devices. If you chose to share your location, you'll stop sharing your location with other family members, and your devices will be removed from the family Find My iPhone device list.\nAny content that your family shared with you isn't automatically removed from your device. You can purchase it again or remove it to free up space on your device. If you downloaded an app from a family member’s purchase history and made In-App Purchases, you'll need to purchase the app yourself to access your In-App Purchases.\nAny DRM-protected music, movies, TV shows, books, or apps that you previously downloaded from other family member's collections will no longer be usable, and other family members won't be able to use content downloaded from your collection.\n\nThe family organizer can remove anyone over 13 from the family group at any time.\nGo to Settings > [your name] > Family Sharing, tap the name of the family member you want to remove, then tap Remove.

If the family organizer stops Family Sharing, it removes all family members from the family group at once.\nGo to Settings > [your name] > Family Sharing, tap your name as the organizer, then tap Stop Family Sharing.  If you're using iOS 10.2 or earlier, go to Settings > iCloud > Family. \n\n", "Q: What is involved in converting a PC video card to have boot screen on the Mac? I've got a PC video card that I'd like to get boot screen support for on my Mac Pro. In particular, it is a Gigabyte R9 270X. The card is supported on the Mac once it boots, but I would like to get boot screen back since my old 8800GT has been baked in the oven a few too many times by now :-)\nI've seen numerous guides on the internet about flashing the BIOS on the video cards and also ones that speak about adding the EFI BIOS, but in the haphazard forum approach, it isn't clear how this all works. To some degree, I've recently come away with the notion that you don't get rid of the existing BIOS, but rather add an EFI partition to it that the Mac would recognize. If that assumption is correct, then it would lead me to believe that adding an EFI BIOS that works on a similar card (R9 280X or 7950 which are both close but not quite) should work since I'm assuming that the existing BIOS would be similar enough to hook in. Failing that, I'm not clear how you would get a card-specific EFI BIOS for boot screen support.\nAnyone an expert on this? I'm just really having a hard time trying to sift through all this and hoping to get a more direct answer!\n\nA: From what I understand, it's not the Mac Pro, it's the graphics card that needs to be flashed so that it's \"Apple approved\"\nFor example, on MacUpgrades, they list an Saphire Radeon RX 580\nwith 8GB RAM\n\nIt has been flashed to work on the Mac Pro 2008 (MacPro 3,1) - Mac Pro\n  2012 (MacPro5,1) models.\n\nI ran across a video of the flashing procedure for a newer (but same family) of video cards - though the procedure does require the use of Windows (meaning Bootcamp).\nYou will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*GPU-Z to back up your cards firmware\n\n*ATIWinFlash to flash the firmware\n\n*The EXACT firmware for your Mac and video card\n\n\nI currently don't have the required components to test/verify this procedure so proceed with caution.

I am only able to see the time, location, weather etc but not the date.\n\nA: Apple Watch doesn't have a great variety of faces to choose from. You have to choose one that has a \"complication\", which means configuration option and/or display option, that can be configured to display the date. Press and hold your current face at a location that doesn't activate another function, swipe left and right to look at available faces, then choose the customize button at the bottom or the New choice, and select one that includes date by default or lets you add one thru the use of a complication. You can control this process with greater intricacy using the Apple Watch app on iPhone. \n", "Q: Clicking on external links opens Chrome but not the link When I click on an external link and Google Chrome is not running yet, Chrome will launch but will not open the linked page. Instead, it starts at my last opened tab (which is the behaviour I expect), but the clicked link should also open in another tab.\nWhen I click the link a second time, it will open correctly in a new tab.\nWhy is this?\nEDIT:\nFor clarification, it's about macOS. Furthermore, I found it behaves different to how I described above. The link is opened in a new window the first time, instead of a new tab in the existing window. The problem is, that it does not come to the front, so the old window from my last session in Google Chrome is in the front. You don't notice the new window behind the old one unless you use mission control to see there is a second window.\nEDIT 2:\nSince this question got a lot of attention I finally accepted the top voted answer, though this wasn't my problem in the first place at all. I can see that there are two problems here:\n\n\n*\n\n*When there is a pending Chrome update, Chrome does not open the external link at all, just opens another window with the default start screen. (Bug)\n\n*When Chrome is up to date, external links are opened but this time still a new window in the background and not as a new tab when restoring the last session. (bad design)\nHope this should be clear now :)\n\nA: Updating Chrome solved the issue for me.\nNOTE: The problem can reproduce each time a new version of Chrome is available...\n\nA: Updating Chrome also solved this problem for me.

Then I checked Chrome | About Chrome and it was waiting for me to relaunch to update. That fixed it.\n\nA: Actually the workaround has been merged in Chromium already\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/801030:\n\nIn macOS 10.13, if:\n  - Chromium is the default browser\n  - Chromium has updated\n  - The user has not relaunched\nand the user tries to open a link from an external program, instead of\n  opening the link in the running instance of Chromium, LaunchServices\n  tries to open a second instance of Chromium.\nCurrently, this causes the running instance to open a blank new\n  window.\n\nSo this issue has nothing to do with the App Update, before it is released in Google Chrome we must restart the application to fix it temporary.\nThe actual root cause and proposed solution is here:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=777863#c56\n\nA: I uninstalled Chrome with AppCleaner and did a fresh install.

I have already signed in with ten different Apple IDs on this Mac this was the 12th time I was trying to create a new Apple ID and sign in to this Mac, and it was then when my Mac (system preferences) gave me an error that this Mac can no longer be used to make a new Apple ID please check myappleid.com, so I went over to my appleid.com and created a new Apple ID then tried to sign in to iCloud with this new Apple ID, it was then when my Mac/system preferences gave me this error that this mac can no longer be used to sign in with a new Apple ID!\nI am stuck, please help!\n\nA: That Mac is likely now locked out due to automated processing to detect fraudulent account creation.\nYou'll want to use it with one of the 10 AppleID you made initially on it. I presume that after several weeks or months you might be able to make another AppleID - but you likely got flagged as abusing the AppleID system and would need to contact Apple and have your IP address white listed so you can create a large number of new Apple ID.\nThey do this for schools and businesses that need to make a lot of Apple ID - reach out to your Apple Sales contact or get together a list of the serial number of the Mac you have so they can see why you need so many new Apple ID at your site.\nOtherwise, I would stick to making one test account and one production account and working with Apple to clear / reuse your test account for testing purposes. There are formal testing programs for education, business and if you are a non-profit - you might easily fall under either program to set up some test accounts for testing that don’t belong one-to-one to actual people using different devices.\n\nA: It sounds like your Mac has reached the limit of how many iCloud accounts it can create. To explain what's going on, I need to start with a bit of background about the Apple ID/iCloud account system.\nAn Apple ID is basically an identity in Apple's system that you can use to interact with Apple for a wide variety of services -- iCloud, iTunes music purchases, App store purchases, Apple Developer account, posting to discussions.apple.com, etc etc etc. The first time you use an Apple ID for a particular service, it generally goes through a little setup process to enable that Apple ID for that particular service. For example, the first time you use a particular Apple ID with the Mac App Store, it'll ask you to agree to the MAS terms & conditions, and enter/verify your name, address, and payment info. If you create the Apple ID in a service, the ID creation and service setup processes get done together.\niCloud is one of the services that can be set up on an Apple ID. Basic Apple IDs are free, but iCloud accounts cost Apple money (ok, not very much) because they include storage, email service, etc. Thus, Apple sets a limit on the creation of iCloud accounts. I don't think the limit is documented anywhere (and may change without notice), but last time I tested there you can only create three iCloud accounts (/set up three Apple IDs for iCloud) per Apple device (Mac, iPhone, iPad).\nYour Mac has reached its limit.\nNote that this three account limit only applies to the initial setup of iCloud services -- either creating a new ID for iCloud or using an existing Apple ID for iCloud for the first time. You can use as many iCloud accounts as you want on the Mac, as long as they were created/set up on other devices. Re-using existing iCloud accounts does not count against the limit.\n", "Q: How to display a 'delete button' on the touchbar? I recently got a new MacbookPro with the Touch Bar, I would like to add a button to the control strip that acts like a typical delete key, AKA it removes the character in front of the cursor.\nIs it possible to add a delete button without paid software?\n\nA: I haven't tried this but in theory I think it could work.\nYou can try making the touchbar show function keys for that app so that you do not need to hold fn: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207240\nThen download Karabiner-Elements (which is free) to change one of the function keys to a delete key.\n\nA: Actually, you already can do that without the touchbar :\n\n*\n\n*With the regular Delete key can be done by holding down the Function, or fn key while pressing it.\n\n\n*By pressing Control + D.\n\n\n*You can delete the entire word behind the cursor by pressing Control + Delete or Option + Delete.\n\n\n*You can delete the entire line of text or paragraph behind the cursor by pressing Command + Delete.\nBut if you really want a one-press-button solution, you could use  BetterTouchTool (and for $5, is almost a free option...) that allow you to make personalize shortcut ; or simply do an automator workflow to do a delete action (every workflow you make will appear on a section in the touchbar, more info here).\n", "Q: Show header only on first page on Pages How to show header only on the first page in a document?\n\nA: *\n\n*Make the front page its own section.

Since I don't need or want the more intrusive newer versions of office, if this works, it may be a good solution.

While trying to get the USB WiFi antenna working again on my wireless bridge I found the adapter's light wasn't activating, so I tried plugging it into my iMac to troubleshoot. The computer didn't acknowledge the antenna when I plugged it in. Assuming it needed a driver, I rooted around and found a 10.7 driver pkg on the adapter's driver disc.\nI proceeded to install said driver, and reboot. On reboot the device was still not recognized, but now the dock's icon set had changed. My dock usually contains Finder (Obviously), Firefox, Terminal, Settings, and Mission Control. However, now Maps, iBooks, Siri, and Photos were also on the dock, dispersed randomly throughout my other icons. On top of this both my docked app's custom icon and one of my docked folder's custom icons were reset (the icons were replaced by question marks, but the apps would still launch).\nI've managed to fix the disappearing folder icon, however my app's custom icon is still missing on every boot, no matter how many times I fix it, and Maps, iBooks, Siri, and Photos still reappear in my dock in the same spots every time I turn on the machine. This was at first a minor inconvenience, but it has since become a major annoyance that causes me to hesitate to reboot or switch over to Windows at all, knowing I'll have to reconfigure the dock each time.\nI've tried to delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.db, but unsurprisingly with no luck. This is a very oddly specific problem and I'm struggling to think of any explanation as to why this is happening or why a WiFi driver install package would even be able to cause this problem.\nSystem in question is iMac 14,2 macOS Sierra 10.12.6. Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance.

I'd be happy remapping my Caps Caps Lock to be a Command key if need be, but I want to make the Mac ignore the fact that the left Command key is always pressed.\n\nA: One thing is remapping a key.  It's another thing altogether to ignore a key that's a modifier key.  This is not the biggest issue, however.\nShort answer:  You need to take it in for repairs and at the very minimum have it cleaned with an ultrasonic cleaner or some sort of solvent for electronics.  \nThe problem is not the alcohol in the beer, but the sugars and other ingredients that can short out components.  You are already seeing that because you have shorted out the electrical contacts for the Command key making it appear it's pressed.\nThis is not a \"software fix\" per se because the issue is a physical one - you have physically shorted the connections so no matter what happens, the system is going to see that key pressed because, it is.\nYou will most likely have to get the keyboard replaced.  \n", "Q: An unknown modem appears in network device list - evidence of tampering?

It used to work as expected but now just hangs forever and just says:\n\nfind: /dev/fd/3: Not a directory\n  find: /dev/fd/4: Not a directory\n\nls -lOeR /dev/fd/* says that /dev/fd/0, /dev/fd/1, and /dev/fd/2 are character special files and that 3 and 4 are directories, all owned by root. \nIt then says:\n\n/dev/fd//3:\n  ls: 3: Not a directory\n  ls: 4: directory causes a cycle  \n\n/dev/fd//3 has two slashes before the three which I don't understand either. Does anyone know what is going on with find and why this randomly started. I'm not able to use find anymore and had previously never even heard of /dev/fd. \n\nA: Find has not randomly stopped working, but is functioning as it should. The problem is that you're running a command that you do not fully understand. It sounds likely that you do not at all want to have find looking through your /dev directory.\nThe reason you get different results with find and ls is that the /dev/fd directory does not represent a physical directory on disk. Instead it is a virtual file system that contains the file descriptors that the process looking at /dev/fd have obtained.\nThis means that ls sees one /dev/fd while find sees another (and similar for all other running processes).\nIn essence you want to take a look at your find command and make sure it is constructed correctly for the task you want to perform. If you want to ask about that on SO, please remember to include the full command you're trying to run as well as what you're expecting that command to do for you.\n", "Q: Launching mp3 file from Finder, iTunes first tells me it's \"copying\" it - to where? I download MP3 podcasts when I have Wi-Fi to listen to when I'm offline.\nI just download them onto the hard drive. I don't have an iPod or phone or anything else attached to the Mac, either by cable or BlueTooth, etc.\nWhen I doubleclick on the MP3 to listen to it, iTunes starts up and I've noticed there's first a message telling me that it's copying the MP3.\nWhy? Where is it making this copy? Can I disable it? I don't need two copies.\n\nA: It is putting the file in the iTunes library. you can find that location by going here:\niTunes Preferences > Advanced\n\nAnd it is listed under iTunes Media Folder Location at the top of the window.\nDefault behavior is to copy the file to the iTunes media folder. If you uncheck \"Copy media to iTunes media folder when adding to library\" on that same Preferences window it will stop doing that.\n\nA: Steve's answer is correct... though you need to consider something else.\nAre you ever going to listen to these again?\nDo you want iTunes to always know where they are?\nIf you delete or move the original from your downloads folder, iTunes will lose track of it.\nSo, if you want to keep them, leave the setting as it was, to automatically copy - then once it's finished you can delete the original from downloads & iTunes will always know where it is.\nIf you don't want to keep them - if you only want to listen once then discard - you can get around iTunes ever seeing them by tapping the spacebar instead.\nThe built-in QuickLook will play it so long as you don't select anything else in the Finder as it's playing, though you can switch apps & get on with other work. Another tap of the spacebar & it stops.\niTunes will never know it existed.\n\nA: Another approach if you do not want iTunes to add it to its library, and if you do not want iTunes to make a copy: Control-click your MP3 file, and select \"always open with…\".\nInstead of iTunes (the default), open it with Quicktime. Future .mp3 files will then launch Quicktime instead of iTunes and no copies will be made.\nOther media-playing apps are available, such as VLC or whatever you prefer.\n", "Q: Red and blinking areas on Mac I have MacBook Air, 13 inches, macOS Sierra. \nVersion 10.12.5\nSometimes when I put mouse over or click on some text - the area where mouse pointing getting red, sometimes this red area is getting bigger and started blinking and looks like those changings on screen are nor related to mouse.\nIt happened once a week and I could not tell what trigger this.\nI was told by Mac representative that this is probably some sort of  malware.\nBut I have application Adware Medic and it doesn't detect any malware. \nI think that it is possible hardware issue.\nAny suggestion what cause this issue and how to fix it?\nthanks.\n//EDITED\nSometimes I have no red (see pictures below):\n\n\n\nA: You may be able to run some diagnostic tests yourself if you follow the Apple article How to use Apple Diagnostics which also includes a link for machines introduced before 2013. \nWorst case scenario: you have a graphics card issue. The in-built diagnostic tests may not be able to give a definite answer. An Apple Store or authorised repairer can diagnose this. \nBefore assuming the worst, I would recommend backing up your machine, running some diagnostic tests, and if you find no problems try re-installing the operating system. It is possible that re-installing your non-Apple applications one-by-one may reveal the culprit.\n", "Q: Strange messages from fsck_hfs I am trying to check an entire USB external disk that is not erased.

No modification performed?\n\n\nI don't understand this. Have fsck_hfs fixed my disk? I by fixed I mean mark the block as unusable or reformatted it or whatever?\nThanks\n\nA: The command you have given includes the \"-l\" option, which means to perform a \"test-only check\" and that \"no repairs can be made\". Essentially this means that it won't write to the file system, which explains your questions 1 and 4.\nRegarding questions 2 and 3: The disk as such might be \"OK\" (i.e. usable) from the point of view of the filesystem even though a single bad block has been detected. As you have specified the \"-S\" option, fsck_hfs will attempt to match the bad block to a file name - it found not match. This could indicate that the bad block does not affect any of your files.\nConsider replacing the drive when you start having bad blocks. \n", "Q: Still not possible to convert HFS+ Journaled boot to APFS? We're at High Sierra beta 9, and it still doesn't seem possible to convert an HFS+ Journaled boot drive \"in-place\" to APFS.\nI tested this with a totally fresh install using a late 2014 27\" Retina iMac, installing onto an external SATA LaCie Thunderbolt 2 drive that I partitioned into three parts: 500GB for Sierra, 500GB for High Sierra, and 1TB for future use.\nWhile I was able to install the latest High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A360a) on one of the partitions, I could not get the option to convert that HFS+ Journaled partition into APFS.\nSupposedly, it can be done \"in place\" by booting to the 10.13 Recovery partition, starting the Disk Utility, and using the menu options to \"Convert to APFS\".  However, when I did that those options are grayed out when a partition containing an OS is selected.

It installed, it booted, and it ran through its setup processes.  For a very long time, it seemed it was doing something to the internal Fusion drives -- and I didn't see them mount on the desktop, but I think maybe Spotlight was trying to index them.  During this time, neither Safari nor System Preferences would open (\"Application could not be opened)\".  However, eventually, things settled down and I was able to eject my internal Fusion drive, and I was able to do things again.  So we'll see.\n\nA: \nAwfully hard to test our software on a new file system if I can't convert the boot drive to the new file system\n\nSince you have space to spare: convert an empty partition to APFS, then install 10.13 on the APFS partition.

I had to back everything up and erase the drive, reformatting it to APFS from the network recovery Disk Utility, and then from that install High Sierra. None of this went well from the Recovery Partition.\n\nA: It is possible from recovery mode. Start the mac in recovery mode (hold cmd+R at boot). Open disk utility, select volume from the left click Edit and convert to APFS.

It seems that some files (or name thereof) are \"ineligible\" for iCloud drive. For example, if the file name ends with a tilde, it cannot be uploaded to iCloud drive.

Observation: Machine A had HPFS+ with iCloud drive subscription. Machine B had APFS and joined the same iCloud drive. When the content was downloaded, all the directories had a fresh modification date on them.\nExperiment / Observation 2: Machines A and B are using the same iCloud drive. Disconnect the network connection on B. Create and empty directory on A. After some time connect B back to the network. The empty directory gets downloaded on B but with a fresh modification time (time of download on B). This does not happen for files.\nSetup: In the above \"experiments / observations\", machine A is running macOS 10.12.6 on an HPFS+ (case-sensitive and encrypted). Machine B is running macOS 10.13 beta on an APFS (case-sensitive and encrypted).\nQuestion: I would like to know what metadata are saved and restored for files in iCloud drive. For example what kind of time stamps are kept (creation time, last read time, last modification time, ...)? Are file names case-sensitive? Are they normalised?\nHas Apple published any reference on this?\n\nA: iCloud Drive is not stored on a traditional file system per se on Apple's servers.\nOn your Mac, the files in iCloud Drive are stored simply on the existing file system on your hard drive - usually HFS+. You can find the files at the following path:\n~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/\n", "Q: A command line utility to test the status of files in iCloud drive directory Is there a command-line program that determines the status of files (uploaded, uploading, ineligible, etc) in the iCloud drive?\nFor example, I would like to be able to use a program such as find to get a list of files that have not been successfully uploaded to iCloud drive.\n\nA: You can use brctl status.\nIt outputs alot, but you can grep pretty easily, for example brctl status |grep needs-sync-up |cut -d'\"' -f2 will show you all files waiting for being uploaded (without their path), or use brctl status |grep 'somefile.ext' for checking the status of somefile.ext.\nSee brctl --help for more.\n", "Q: El Capitan download for Mac Pro - App store \"system is too new\" I have a Mac Pro 3,1, which came without a hard drive.\nNow I want to install macOS El Capitan on a new SSD in this machine.\nI started creating a USB-Stick with El Capitan on it.\nI used this link: https://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?mt=12 which leads me to the App Store.\nBut if I click on download, it says that it can't install macOS on my hard drive because the system is too new. \nThe system I used to do this is my Mac mini 5,1 with Sierra.\nHow can I create, with this Mac mini, a USB Stick with El Capitan setup for my old Mac Pro?\n\nA: You'll struggle... the 3,1 won't boot from USB.\nPeople say you can but I've had one since new & no amount of cajoling has ever made it do so. \nIf you have El Capitan in your purchase history on the Mini, then that's where you will be able to download it. The version linked in the App Store can only be run on machines that cannot run Sierra.\nIf you have a clean external USB drive, you could get the installer onto it the same way as you would have onto a USB stick. If you then drop the drive in the 3,1 it will boot from that.\nAlternatively, once you have the right installer, you can run it to the external from the Mini & then swap it into the 3,1.\n\nA: Here are instructions on MacRumors on how to create a bootable DVD for El Capitan. Obviously needs an existing Mac and some comfort level in shell scripting, BASH, etc.\nAlternatively, if you have an earlier installation DVD for Snow Leopard (the MacPro3,1 originally shipped with Leopard, but people would have upgraded with the $29 DVD to Snow Leopard), then I'd presume you can download El Capitan from the App Store and do it that way?\n", "Q: Transfer speed much slower in Wi-Fi than Ethernet I'm transferring a lot of pictures from my Macbook Pro to a local Synology NAS (DS116), using an FTP software named Transmit.\nI noticed that the upload speed is quite different between Wi-Fi and Ethernet:\n\n*\n\n*Using Wi-Fi (ac): ~27 MB/s in FTP mode, and ~22 MB/s in AFP mode\n\n\n*Using Ethernet (via a Thunderbolt adapter): ~110 MB/s, in both FTP and AFP modes\nI don't understand why the Wi-Fi transfers are so slow compared to Ethernet.

I'd like to see data on past voice calls using an iPhone.\nHow far back can you check for a time duration that was made on my behalf without resorting to contacting a cellular carrier or looking at my past billing statements? \n\nA: Within the UI (user interface) itself you can only view the history of the past 100 calls, irrespective of whether those calls were all made within the past day or past month etc. However, this is an inconvenient way to view your call history if it's something you want to analyse, especially if it's on a regular basis.\nFor something a lot more convenient, such as viewing your call history in a spreadsheet or text file, you can use 3rd party software such as iExplorer.\nWith iExplorer you can access, view and export this data, either directly from your iPhone or from an iTunes backup of your iPhone. This is important because:\n\n\n*\n\n*the option of access this data from an iTunes backup means you can go over the call history of past iPhones you've owned (i.e. if you have Time Machine backups or you manually keep old iPhone backups)\n\n*being able to view your call history in a text or csv file is so much easier to analyse\n\n\nIf you're interested, you can read How to Export Your iPhone Call History.\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am not affiliated in any way with the iExplorer software.\n\n*Not all functions are available without a purchase, however you can view your call history without purchasing it (but you won't be able to export the data)\n\n", "Q: What is hardware type ID in keylayout xml file? In a \".keylayout\" file there is <layout> element where you can specify a \"mapSet\" and \"modifierMap\" for a range of keyboard types. Apples Technical Note TN2056 describes the XML file structure, but not what a \"keyboard type hardware ID\" actually is. They say: \n\nApple will map new keyboard hardware IDs to one of the existing ones,\n  so it is usually sufficient to copy and paste the entire \n  element from an existing keyboard layout.\n\nGreat, but I really would like to understand what this ID is.\nAt first look it seems like ID 0 through 17 are ANSI keyboards, but when I look at the key layout for European layouts (which are usually ISO keyboards) I find ID 0 and 1, so I guess the IDs are not related to ANSI/ISO/JIS.\n\nA: I got an excellent answer in the Google Group \"Ukelele Users\" (link directly to the answer) from John Brownie. The hardware ID is what is returned by CGEventSourceGetKeyboardType. Mr Brownie writes: \n\nThe keyboard ID is what is reported back to the system when certain\n  system calls are made. Historically, these were 'gestalt' calls, but\n  currently it uses Quartz Events, calling CGEventSourceGetKeyboardType.\n\nFor a list of IDs, see the answer in the group.\n", "Q: Saving an iTunes playlist to USB, whilst keeping edits and track numbers in place? I'm trying to save a playlist from my iTunes onto a USB stick ready for an event, most people seem to recommend drag and drop which does work, but the order of the songs is completely out, and any edits I've made through iTunes to the start/end point of songs and normalising the volume are no longer in place.\nI was tempted to try to burn it to a CD and then re-import it somehow, but that seems really clunky and the playlist won't fit onto a CD anyway.\nAny suggestions please? I know I can do it manually, but it's a large playlist which will be changing all the time. Thank you\n\nA: I am assuming that the USB stick has no software on it and whatever is playing the music simply reads the audio from the stick/SD card. Is it a Pioneer CDJ by any chance?\nSeems the best way to play the tracks from the USB/SD in the same order as the iTunes playlist is to add track numbers to the music files. That way even the most basic audio player will 'most likely' read from 01, 02, 03,... etc.\nSo how to rename the tracks easily.\nBy hand, might prove too time consuming as you say there are a lot.\nUse an Applescript from Doug\nhttps://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=incrementnumbertags\nor the older\nhttps://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=numbersongsplayorder\nwould probably suit your situation.\nNote, renaming tracks may mess the iTunes library in a way you don't want, so maybe, to begin with, you should work with duplicates.\nI forgot to add one last thing. Assuming you're using a recent iTunes you don't need to duplicate the tracks first.\nThe workflow would be\nSelect your Playlist you want on the USB stick. (make sure the playlist is in the play order you want)\nSelcect the Script to add 01, 02, 03, etc to your track names in Itunes.

I want only one alert per event.\n\nA: Settings → Notifications → Messages → Repeat Alerts and set it to Never.\nFor what it's worth, the default setting of repeat once means that an unread message notification will alert twice unless a subsequent message arrives or you read the message, the latter of which can be from the lock screen. This only applies to messages, not other alerts/events, and only once more than the normal notification, not continuously.\nAn important distinction from what you said about unlocking — you don't need to unlock, you just need to interact, so any of these will disable the second alert:\n\n\n*\n\n*being the one to turn the phone on with the sleep/wake button\n\n*sleeping the phone after a notification with the sleep/wake button rather than letting the device time out\n\n*3D Touch on a notification\n\n*dismiss the notification\n\n", "Q: iTunes Connect payment made on a closed account My iTunes connect is linked to an old account that closed on September 4 or 5, so I have no more access to it to check if the payment has been made on it.\nI changed bank so I updated my banking infos in iTunes Connect in order to receive the next payments on my new banking account and received a mail on August 30, 2017 that saying my banking infos has been processed.

What exactly happens when you install an app from a .dmg image. My understanding was that it changes the inode and makes it executable (the specific application was GNU Scheme). But that can't be it since it takes about ~1m.\n\nA: DMG is a disk image file format.\nDisk image files behave like a physical disk. In so doing, the operating system interprets them in the same way as if you had just inserted a CD-ROM, USB drive, etc into the computer. \nTherefore, how long an application takes to install depends almost entirely on the application itself (e.g. It's size, whether it needs an installer, etc) and other factors such as the speed of your drive.\nFor more info on DMG files you may want to read my answer here.\n", "Q: Release date for iOS 11?

Add this to your toolbar and you should be fine.\n[EDIT]\nNow that I'm in front of a Mac running macOS Sierra, I've determined that the icon you're looking for has been replaced with a new icon (see below):\n\nOnce again, this icon will change depending on the current status of the email you have highlighted. If Mail thinks it's already Junk, then the arrow points up instead so that you're removing it out of the trash. Otherwise the arrow points down by default so that clicking on it will trash it.\n", "Q: Safari IOS keeps redirecting to https to non-supported http site I'm using Cloudflare, i have set redirect https to http and it just ends up in a redirect loop on Safari,\n Neither removing cache worked.

I was wondering if I should by a CoolerMaster X3 cooling pad for my mac. I got a Late 2011 mac which reaches temp 80 degrees C even at 720p video buffering in browser and goes bonkers if I switch it up to 1080p or above or any quality at 60FPS.\nIt also gets hot while running simple programming softwares. Should I buy the cooling pad? Is it worth it?\nI'm not looking forward to performance boost, I have to use this mac for a few more years. I just don't want it to get damaged due to heat effects in that time!\n\nA: You actually don't need a cooling pad. You can manually change the fan speed on Mac with this utility called smcFanControl. You can get it here. You may also want to try to reset SMC to make sure that your fan is working properly.\n\nA: I’m using a MPB 15 Mid 2013 (the first retina MacBook). It has a Core i7 CPU (”Ivy Bridge“) with a maximum specified temperature of 105 °C. When using it, it’s mostly running at temperature levels of 90 to 100 degrees. There never was any hardware issue and it still performs perfectly. In other words, this is normal.\nA late 2011 MacBook Pro also has a Core i7 (”Sandy Bridge“) CPU. It’s maximum allowable temperature is 100 °C which means that 80 degrees is more than acceptable. From the processor’s point of view this would almost be ”cool“...\nApple has gone to great lengths implementing proper power and cooling management. I’d therefore strongly recommend you refrained from using any of those third-party tools which fiddle around with temperature management. I spent 15 years of educating prospective Apple Service Technicians the proper techniques of servicing Mac desktops and portables. And I cannot remember a single incident of a Mac dying from overtemperature.\nThe only temperature level you should really be aware of is that of your hard disk (provided you don’t have a SSD built in). This is probably the only component in your Mac which would seriously suffer from extended periods of high temperature.

And, just for the record, Apple does sell these models directly in Taiwan.\nAlso, by default Apple designs these products to ensure their devices\n\n\n*\n\n*do not exceed the level of allowable transmitter power, the different available channels, and the times those channels can be occupied. \n\n*will not transmit at a power above what is allowable in any nation to which they sell, nor will their products use frequencies that are not permitted in any nation.\n\n\nA: Thanks for your professional answer ! It's really helpful ! At your point , It really makes sense. By the way, about the radio output power , I \"guess\" the wireless chipset may be the same as the Apple AirPort Extreme.(BCM 43XX). And I found that it is 32.5 dBm which is shown by the apple website. I don't know if the 32.5 dBm could be the MacBook Pro 's radio output power !? But, for sure, it's safe to fill 20 dBm in the input document and also the frequency are 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz. – James yesterday   delete\n", "Q: How to get Automator to \"Copy Finder Items\" and only keep one copy? I've build a short Automator workflow.\nIt does a \"Get Specified Finder Items\" from directory \"sourcesfiles\".\nThen does a \"Copy Finder Items\" to directory \"targetdir\".  The \"Replace Existing Files\" is unchecked.\nI have a cron job set up to run it every 2 minutes.  It runs and works.  It copies the \"sourcefiles\" directory to the \"targetdir/sourcefiles\".\nHowever, when the files are deleted from the \"sourcefiles\" directory, it copies an empty directory to \"targetdir\" ... that is, the backed up files in \"targetdir\" get deleted.\nI tried checking the \"Copy Finder Items > Replace Existing Files\" checkbox.  But then it created a new copy every time.

I just bought a 4k monitor (AOC u2777pqu) for my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13 inch, Early 2015). The shop advised a mini-DisplayPort to HDMI cable, which gives me 4k resolution but when I tried it only provided a refresh rate of 30Hz.\nThe Apple support guide ( https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT206587 ) suggests that the Thunderbolt cable will allow this model to run 4k at 60Hz.\nMy question whether getting a 'pure DisplayPort' ( mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable - 4k certified) provide the 60Hz at 4k? \n\nA: Officially, your model MacBook Pro will support up to 3840 by 2160 pixels at 30Hz or 4096 by 2160 pixels at 24Hz if using a HDMI connection, which explains your experience of 30Hz with your mini-DisplayPort to HDMI cable.\nYour model MacBook Pro also supports up to 3840 by 2160 pixels at 60Hz using a Thunderbolt connection. Since your display supports both a 60Hz refresh rate and a DisplayPort connection, then using a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable of sufficient quality should achieve what you want.\n", "Q: A specific Safari WebKit page on iOS - how to see memory usage graph in Instruments? I've set up Xcode/Instruments so that I'm monitoring an iPhone 6s's memory usage altogether. I've got a specific com.apple.WebKit Process that I would like to see very finetuned information on - as precise as possible. This com.apple.WebKit process will eventually crash the Mobile Safari running on an iPhone 6s using iOS 10 - this WebKit process will not crash an iPhone SE running iOS 11 Beta - but that's just to say that \"things will eventually get better\".\nIt seems that 1Gb of memory is not enough to run the com.apple.WebKit process for this specific scripted embed.\nSo, I start Instruments running and I see peaks of 640mb or so of memory usage - but how could I record this memory usage in the finest possible detail, so that I can figure out what drives this over the edge?\n\nA: I would probably consider Instruments job done once you know mobile safari is allocating 640 MB of ram and move on to Safari web inspector. Setting it up is quite easy and since you have XCode and macOS safari, you have first party tools to debug your process while it runs in real time.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/safari-developer/safari-developer-tools-overview-dev073038698/mac\nThe activity viewer will right away focus your efforts based on whether you have excessive warnings and errors or simply are loading a lot of assets.\n\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone 7 have a laser? In the box of my iPhone 7 there was a leaflet with all sorts of small print easy enough to be dismissed as some legal document (and maybe it is). I couldn't help reading it and on the reverse page it says something about Class 1 Laser Information:\n\nSee text: \"This device contains a laser\"\nSo my question is where in the iPhone and, more importantly, for what purpose is the laser in the iPhone?\n\nA: This site indicates that the front facing proximity sensor consists of the laser and filters to attenuate the signal to safe levels once assembled. \n\nLocated in the front of the phone, above the main speaker, the FlightSenseTM proximity sensor uses optical land-grid array (LGA) packaging. The custom Apple device measures 2.80 mm x 2.40 mm, half the size of the rest of STMicroelectronics’s portfolio.\n\nThat reinforces the warning about repair and implies potential danger if you operate the components while the iPhone is disassembled. \n\nA: Well you can also use it for lecturers and presentations. It's something apple wanted to put on iphone a long time ago, but because safety issues and company decided to delay its usage. Also it servers for many other features, espicially at calculating distance for apps such as your camera.\nI hope it works.\n", "Q: Applescript : String to Date I'm extracting different date formats from a web page.\nE.g.

This design decision also enhances performance and saves battery life since every app isn’t trolling all the others for updates or plundering data it can then upload in efforts to track everything you do and store on your device. \nThat being said, there are several common file storage API on iOS. If every app you use did store the video/image/data in a common place, there’s no technical reason why you couldn’t have the same unified view. \nIn practice, you’ll need to manually curate or save off media you want on a case by case basis since most “free” apps like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook have business models that make sharing content against their best interest. Since consumers are the product instead of the customer of those apps, I don’t foresee huge or quick adoption of common storage on iOS anytime soon - even with iOS 11 making it far easier to use the “generic searchable file system” idiom you mention that common on computers and android os. \n", "Q: Any way to have Safari/Keychain autofill password on a single site with prompting on all sites? I use a different password manager for most sites, but there is one site it doesn't work correctly on, but Safari/Keychain does work.  I can manually store my password in Keychain for that one site, and it works correctly. However, turning on password autofill makes Safari prompt to save passwords on all sites, which I don't want. Is there any way to tell Safari to autofill passwords that it knows about but not to prompt to save any new ones?\n\nA: I'm not sure if this workaround will suit you, but does the site in question offer a \"Remember me\" type option? If so, you could just manually log into that site and tick the 'remember me' option so that you don't need to log in again.\nAssuming the above works for you, then you can keep using your password manager as you do now and also avoid enabling Safari's password autofill function. You can then keep this workaround in place until your password manager supports the site in question.\n", "Q: How to save old Messages on a Mac? i have all my old conversations from Messenger on my Mac (and not on my iphone). As I want to put the upcoming High Sierra on a previously deleted Mac instead of simply updating my Mac I wonder if it is possible to somehow save the old conversations. Any ideas?\n\nA: iMessage conversations appear to be saved in ~/Library/Messages.\nTo see your Library folder, you'll need to use Go > Go to Folder... (⇧⌘G) and then type in ~/Library. If your new Mac doesn't have any messages on it, you should be able to just copy the folder over (but make sure Messages is closed while doing it).\nMake sure to back up the destination Messages folder before copying if you are worried about losing data (just rename it Messages-Old or something).

About a year ago, the keyboard and trackpad quit working. I took it to the Apple Store and they said it could be that the cable went bad. They also said they may have to replace the whole bottom casing. I figured if it was just the cable, it would be worth me fixing it by myself. I'm not the most experienced MacBook mechanic, but I generally know what I'm doing.\nAnyway, I've been using the MacBook with an external mouse and keyboard for a year. I bought a new cable for the trackpad, but after the replacement the MacBook won't even turn on. I switched back to the old one and it still won't turn on. What could have gone wrong? I've unplugged and replugged the battery, used two different power cords, etc..\n\nA: Listen buddy i have a similar problem. When you changed the ribbon cable you have probably forgot to remove the cable for the battery. This is why probably your battery went wrong. I also changed the ribbon cable myself and managed to unplugged my battery. This however did not fixed my keyboard and mouse issue (wish it did but it did not) but when i tried to turn it on it was just fine. I would suggest you unplug your battery leave it for few minutes check any cables around take off the ribbon cable put it back on. Then plug the battery properly put the protector on and try to start your mac. If that does not solve your second problem then you better start browsing for a new laptop. \n\nA: Is the part actually the “top case” which contains the speakers, keyboard, trackpad, etc...? Those are so finicky that doing a piece by piece repair even by Apple trained tech is unlikely to work so they replace the entire unit. \nIf you try one more time to carefully reconnect each and every cable (not just the ones you changed) you might be able to avoid the recommended repair. Best case, you get the same quote from Apple if the insides are not damaged in any meaningful way. Worst case, they would fix any damage due to the DIY repair on your dime, testing everything comprehensively and put a 90 day warranty on the Mac. \n", "Q: All default 'Apple' icons disappeared on iPhone 7 I restarted my iPhone 7 today and all stock Apple apps have disappeared like Safari and Settings.

Which I cannot do without the Settings app.\nMy phone is up to date with is 10. \nHow can I get them back?\n\nA: As long as you know the AppleID and password for the device, you can restore without needing to get to the settings app:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263\nThis option is needed for service and if you sell a device and forget to unlock it before it leaves your possession. When multiple apps are broken, a restore is almost always the fix and something you should try once you back up the device as best you can before the erase. \n\nA: You can remove some of the default Apple apps and then \"reinstall\" them by going to the app store. There will be a download for the missing app which will re-activate it. But Settings is not one of the ones that you can remove.\nI think that I would (after verifying you have a recent backup of the phone) restore the iPhone to factory default. Basically connect the phone to your computer, open iTunes, click on the phone icon at the top of the window and then click the \"Restore iPhone\" button (top right).\nThat link has more details and what to do under other circumstances.

I use the ipad + pencil to sketch ideas and write math formulas. I would also like to type in the same document from the macbook. What app can do this?\nI like using Duet to make the iPad function as another macOS screen, but unfortunately the macOS version of evernote doesn't support drawing, only the iOS version lets one draw. \nI have tried using the iPad pro as a standalone iOS device, running evernote. Under this setup, the sketching works great, but now when I need to type something with a keyboard, it's a pain to use the iPad's keyboard. I would much rather use the macbook's.\nA variation on the theme of using the iPad in iOS, perhaps one could use a different sketching app in iOS that syncs very quickly between macbook and ipad. Evernote and notes both do not have live syncing. Do other iOS drawing/typing apps?\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a drawing/typing app for macOS that supports the Pencil on the iPad?\n\n\nOr \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a drawing/typing app for iOS that syncs instantly with macOS?\n\n\nBoth Notes and Evernote suffer the problem of not supporting instant sync on the iOS to macOS. Both also suffer the problem of not having a drawing mode on the macOS version.\nI don't necessarily need to save the notes. I just need a whiteboarding app. I can copy what I come up with to evernote when the draft is done.\n\nA: The best solution that came to my mind was Notability. I personally use Notability for taking notes using my iPhone, iPad and MacBook Pro. Notability supports drawings and typing and has nearly instant speed of showing changes across all the connected devices through iCloud. \nAlso they support Apple Pencil on iPad and will support duet as well. But I'm not sure about that. \nIf you definitely want something like that just give a try to notability.\n", "Q: Prevent Finder from truncating tag names \nIn Finder (Sierra) if you select \"All Tags...\" in the Finder sidebar, it presents a list of tags.

You can increase the width of the column by dragging the on the right border of the column:\n\n\nA: It seemed this wasn't possible to fix in MacOS Sierra. 'High Sierra', released 26 September 2017, reveals complete tag names as you expand the column as opposed to truncating them.\nedit. Now I'm not sure.

Can I return an old 15-inch MBP rechargeable battery to Apple, or does it have to be disposed of locally?\n\nA: The disposal and/or recycling of batteries will differ depending on your local jurisdiction, namely because of local laws.\nIn some jurisdictions you can take your old electronic equipment, including batteries, to any Apple Retail Store. The local store will ensure that it will be recycled in a responsible manner.\nBased on your profile, I see you're based in Germany. Germany is one of those places where Apple will happily take your batteries.\nFor more info, see So einfach wie Apple Produkte sollte auch ihr Recycling sein1.\n\n1 The UK english version of the above referenced page is: Recycling an Apple product is as easy as it is good for the planet.\n", "Q: How to unlock Sierra Refresh Rate for other resolutions less than 4k? I had a MacBook Pro 2017, using a USB-C to HDMI which can support 4K@60Hz.\nI ran CoreDisplay patcher to enable 60Hz for 4K resolution:\n\nBut  Refresh Rate is still locked at 30Hz for other resolutions. Is there a way to unlock 60Hz for 2560x1440? \n\n\nA: HDMI 2.0 4K60Hz might use chroma subsampling (YCbCr422 10bpc)\nhttps://www.rtings.com/tv/learn/chroma-subsampling\nYou can force RGB by overriding the EDID (limits you to 8bpc)\nhttps://www.mathewinkson.com/2013/03/force-rgb-mode-in-mac-os-x-to-fix-the-picture-quality-of-an-external-monitor\nDisplayPort 1.2 is preferred because it has slightly more bandwidth and will allow RGB 10bpc without requiring workarounds.\n2560x1440@60Hz HiDPI uses a scaled resolution of 5120x2880. This means macOS draws into a frame buffer that is 5120x2880 and the graphics card scales the frame buffer to the scaled resolutions base which is 3840x2160 in your case (SwitchResX can change the scaled resolutions base). By default, scaled resolutions are created with only one refresh rate/timing. I think the timing used for the base resolution is the last built-in timing having the same resolution as the scaled resolutions base. This is why 3840x2160 30Hz is chosen for the timing.\nmacOS 10.14.6 has a new hidden preference to enable multiple refresh rates for scaled resolutions (including HiDPI resolutions).\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.CoreDisplay multiRefreshRateScaledModes -bool true\n\nEach scaled resolution (and its corresponding HiDPI resolution) will then have all the timings that the scaled resolutions base has.\nhttps://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/adding-using-hidpi-custom-resolutions.133254/post-1999528\nFor older macOS versions, I guess you'll need code to create scaled resolutions with specific timings, and patches to CoreDisplay to allow them. Code for some (but not all) versions of macOS that might do that is in IOGraphicsLib.c at opensource.apple.com\n", "Q: Mac server MDM profile manager enrollment problem I use mac os server to active the Profile Manager and Open Directory.\nAnd I want to enroll our devices to the server \nWhy My ipad and iphone always get the error:\nProfile Installation Failed\nThe SCEP server configuration is not supported!\n\n[\nIf I use the server to enroll\nProfile installation failed.\nCould not be installed due to an unexpected error.\n<NSOSStatusErrorDomain:-1096>\n\nCould anyone  help me !

It works fine on my Android phone, but on my iPad no captive portal login window appears, and as a result I cannot use the WiFi network. What could the issue be?\n\nA: iOS attempts to connect to http://captive.apple.com. If this request doesn't return the string \"Success\", the captive portal page is opened on the device. Therefore if the router isn't redirecting this request, the captive portal won't be shown.\nUsually in these cases you can open Safari and connect to a non-HTTPS URL where you will be redirected to the captive portal. If you know the URL of the portal through another device, you can enter this in Safari to go straight there if the redirects aren't working properly.\nIf DNS is really not working, you might even need to browse something like http://1.1.1.1 if you don’t see the captive portal log in. \nIn the majority of cases (maybe 98%) this is a problem on the network,  it the iOS device. If you reboot your device and still can’t connect, you’ll need the person(s) that run the network to assist in all likelihood. \n\nA: One workaround that seems to do the trick:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once you've connected to the WiFi, tap the ⓘ symbol next to it.\n\n*On the settings page, find the Router IP address (underneath Subnet Mask)\n\n*Long tap on it, and you'll get a popup to copy it to the clipboard\n\n*Go to Safari and paste it into the address bar*. It should take you to the portal page.\n\n\n* You may need to prefix it with http://\n\nA: Great answers above! One other option I just realized is that this issue can also happen if in the advanced network configuration you have configured a custom DNS IP address.\nCheck and to fix, simply go to\nSettings -> WiFi -> Click the “i” circle -> DNS -> Configure DNS -> set to automatic\nThat will remove any manually added DNS servers.\n", "Q: iPhone doesn't automatically get inbox' child folder mail I have the following folder structure on my mail account\nINBOX\n    folder1\n    folder2\nSENT\n...\n\nMy iPhone (7plus - latest os) does only retrieve messages that are put into INBOX by my mail server, the mails going to folder1, folder2 aren't synced automatically and I will receive them only after I manually entered them inside the Mail app and do a manual refresh of the folder. \nI would need to automatically receive those messages too, but couldn't find an option to do so. \nIs it possible to sync folders automatically that are not INBOX?\n\nA: You need to pick folders to push if you want to sync certain sub-folders for notifications. To do this, go to Settings > Email > Accounts > Fetch new data > iCloud, and choose which folders should be pushed automatically.\nI'm using a free app called 'myMail' that lets me choose the sub-folder to get the notification when there is new e-mail. It's working perfectly with my Gmail, Hotmail and IMAP account that has around 10 sub-folders.

It is their laptop and I still have Admin rights for my work.\nOnly thing is... they have locked my Wallpaper with something quite ugly and I can't change it in the normal way. This is literally the only setting I want to get around. Any idea how I could change it without uninstalling the agent?\n\nA: In general, the success rate of overriding MDM enforced configuration changes is very low. Pragmatically:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can remove the management profile and then make changes as you see fit. \n\n*You can request your device be moved to a different group under air watch that relaxes that restriction. \n\n\nThere could be a bug you could exploit, but Apple and/or air watch would likely patch that since it would also likely be a noticeable failure. \n", "Q: How to access iMessage library using Sequel Pro on macOS I'd like to access my iMessages using Sequel Pro.

Use your best judgement.\nBy the way, this works because the drag and drop clipboard is different then the general clipboard. So the first range of cells just sits there waiting to be pasted as the drag and drop operation didn't disturb it.\n\nA: Not specifically what you were asking for, but maybe it helps someone arriving here (like me): If you want to swap entire rows or columns instead of only selected cells, you can drag-drop on the row number of column letter until the entire row looks like it lifts off of the table, then swap the rows.\n", "Q: macOS Preview function performance drop since update I have a 2011 13' i5 8GB MBP, the user has always used Preview to combine PDFs as part of her work flow. To the best of my knowledge her process hasn't changed, however Preview is now failing to process this, it just locks up and fails to respond. A force quit show it has partially combined the PDF's but only ever adds the first page of the inserted file.\nWe have a text only PDF (roughly ~35KB) and a 2 page scanned document (~750KB).\nThe first file is opened in preview, we hit 'edit > insert from file' and choose the larger scanned file and the whole lot locks up.\nThis worked before the update to macOS (she'd been holding off for other reasons that are now resolved, hence updating only this weekend).\nI see lots of people reporting performance issues with PDF's after the transition to Yosemite, with lots of people complaining of unresolved bugs around the performance of this app but very little with regards to this latest version. \nHow can I measure what might be slowing this down or decide if I need to look to another program / tool to perform this work?\n\nA: The first thing to do is check on some common sense items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor - is the system totally idle or 99% CPU used.\n\n*Open System Information (About this Mac) and check the storage - do any cleanup and if you are on a hard drive - consider freeing up 25% of the space to let the optimization run post OS upgrade.\n\n*Turn off automatic log in so that when you reboot your Mac - you get to choose which account to log in.\n\n*Open the Mac App Store app and apply all updates to Sierra.\n\n*After cleaning out CPU / Disk Space - boot to Recovery HD and let Disk Utility repair the Disk, then repair the Macintosh HD, then repair the disk one last time. If any errors are fixed, power down the Mac and start Recovery HD a second time and repeat until you have no errors detected to fix.\n\n*Now make a new user account and copy the files you’ll use to test to /Users/Shared - restart and log in to the new account and repeat the test for PDF.\n\n\nThis procedure is very general and catches 4/5 of the issues we have at work with our Mac. It’s not specific to preview, but will ensure you don’t look at a specific app when you actually have a system issue slowing down your Mac.\n", "Q: Run a particular Python script as a Service I've got a Python 3 script going that will overlay a particular transparent PDF file on top of another for the purpose of watermarking. \nCopying and pasting the file location of each PDF into the script each time I want to watermark something is a bit of a headache though. The whole thing is not very flexible despite its great power.\nfrom pdfrw import PdfReader, PdfWriter, PageMerge\n\nipdf = PdfReader(\"/users/me/Desktop/meetingminutes.pdf\")\nwpdf = PdfReader(\"/users/me/Desktop/private.pdf\")\n\nwmark = PageMerge().add(wpdf.pages[0])[0]\n\nfor page in ipdf.pages:\n    PageMerge(page).add(wmark).render()\n\nPdfWriter().write('/users/me/Desktop/meetingminutes.pdf', ipdf)\n\nI would ideally like to be able to right click on a given PDF file in Finder and apply the watermark script to it as a service.\nI've done a little bit of tinkering already but the most I've been able to figure out on my own is that I need to run the script as it is (right now) I can make an Automator App with the \"Run AppleScript\" droplet as the first step.\non run {input, parameters}\n    do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/python3 /users/me/Desktop/script.py\n\n    return input\nend run\n\nIt'd be wonderful to scale this up to work on any given PDF.  The actual \"watermark\" image PDF would be at a fixed location on the hard drive and the files on which the service is applied would not be renamed or moved/copied elsewhere (ideally).\n\nA: In Automator, use the \"Run Shell Script\" action. Normally, you would set the shell drop-down list value to \"/usr/bin/python\", to use the built-in python 2.7. However, if you select a unix shell, but make sure that your script contains \"#! /usr/bin/ env python\", or an explicit path to your python3 installation, then it should work.\nIf you select the other drop-down list \"Pass input\" to \"as arguments\", then you can get the filenames of your selected items from sys.argv().\nNote that Automator already comes with a watermark action that lets you put one PDF on top of another. (It's also a python script, if you dig deep enough into /System/Library/Automator/)\n", "Q: How can I remove/change the icloud.com alias on my apple id account There are two email addresses listed in my apple id settings (section \"REACHABLE AT\"):\nme@mydomian.com\nmy.oldname@icloud.com\n\nThe first is my login address. I want to change or remove the second one. How can I do this?\n\nA: Apple does not let you delete or change the primary iCloud email address. You can stop using it, but it'll always be associated with that account.\nSee also https://support.apple.com/ht202667, the section titled \"If you can't change your Apple ID\", which while is not the exact situation you're in, it explains how they look at it.\n\nA: It is now possible to change the primary iCloud email address via Apple support if you can provide proof that you have changed your legal name.\nSee: https://www.selfawaresoup.com/notes/2020/11/24/removing-deadname-from-apple-id/\n", "Q: What syncs when you don't have enough iCloud storage? When you don't have enough iCloud storage (which happens, for example, when you are downgraded from a higher plan to a lower one), you aren't able to sync many iCloud items anymore because you're over your iCloud storage limit.

However, it (thankfully) doesn't seem to prevent your contacts or your calendar items from syncing across your devices.\nIs there a list of what can and can't be synced when you're over your iCloud storage size?\n\nA: There isn't exactly a list, but if you look at their suggests as to what to do when it is full (https://support.apple.com/HT204247), you can see the things that are affected.

I don't think you will be able to find a way to get it to run as root. This isn't a bad thing, though, as running a GUI app as root is generally a terrible idea for security, as there are many ways to surreptitiously inject code into a Cocoa app, and if that app runs as root, you can open up some pretty serious security vulnerabilities this way.\nTo edit files like /etc/hosts, I recommend finding another way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a command-line editor such as emacs, pico, or vi.\n\n*Use a GUI-based text editor that has the feature to prompt for your admin password when needed (I believe BBEdit can do this, for example)\n\n*Simply copy the /etc/hosts file to another location, edit it there, and then use sudo to copy the modified file back to /etc.\n\nA: Not really an answer to what you asked, but as an alternative, have you tried Gas Mask - freeware Hosts file editor.\nIt can edit,  store multiple versions, & switch on the fly.\n\n\nA: Just to close the loop on this (because it was one of the top hits on Google).\nHere is how to open any file\nterminal (bash/zsh):\nsudo open /Applications/Developers\\ Tools/Sublime\\ Text.app /etc/hosts\nsudo open \"/Applications/Developers Tools/Sublime Text.app\" /etc/hosts\n\nalias - entry:\nalias edit=\"sudo open /Applications/Developers\\ Tools/Sublime\\ Text.app\"\n\nalias - usage:\nedit /etc/hosts\n\nAutomator - Quick Action (for use in Finder):\n\n*\n\n*New > Quick Action\n\n\n*Add 'Run Shell Script' Action to workflow\n\n\n*Configure workflow options to be - Workflow receives current files or folders in Finder.app (bolded words are options to select)\n\n\n*Paste the snippet below in the Shell Script action box\nopen -a /Applications/Developers\\ Tools/Sublime\\ Text.app \"$@\"\n\n\n*Save workflow - suggested name \"Open in Sublime Text (as root)\n\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Services and verify that the script appears and is checked off.\n\n\n*Go to Finder and right click and you shall find the option in the context menu to launch the input (the selected file) as root / superuser\nHope this helps anyone else who comes across this.\n", "Q: iPad 1 can't install a new app I want to install Qi Dian on my iPad 1 but I can't.

How can I install this on my iPad 1?\n\nA: The original iPad (iPad 1) can support iOS 3.2 up to iOS 5.1.1 - source here: the iOS Support Matrix.\nAccording to the link you provided for the app, the app you want to install requires iOS 8 or above.\nThis means that you can not install the app on your iPad, since it requires iOS 8, but your iPad can only run up to iOS 5.1.1.\n\nA: The only possible work-around I've found is, if the app has been around for a while and an older version will work on the iPad 1 (or early generations of the iPod touch), is to install it on a newer iPad/iPhone/etc and then on the iPad 1 go into the App Store's Purchased tab and install the latest version that will run on your old hardware. But it's hit-or-miss, and even where some apps did run on older hardware (ForeFlight as an example), the manufacturer has stopped supporting it and it won't launch or might rely on a deprecated and deactivated web service...\n\nA: Since you're using a Mac, you can go to the iTunes App and search for the app to download it there.

Is this normal?\n\nA: As I understand you change the Password of your AppleID - do you think so? \nApple never Share passwords to other devices and never have access to this. \nYour AppleID password is synonymous with your iCloud.

Some of these documents were very long and after editing this post, it no longer fits. I cut some things out and have now posted & linked to the longer one on github.\nA link to the (long) Plist is on github \nhere.\nI’ve done many hours (cumulatively days or even week by now) of searching trying to figure out what many of these processes are. Some appear to be completely normal, some were difficult to identify, and some looked outright malicious (given the context). Some of these processes appear to be programs that would tell another person about my activity, what I’m doing with my files or give another person control of my files either on my local network and/or remotely.\nOne such example is Aventail. It looks like a program that monitors activity. \nhttps://www.eventtracker.com/knowledge-center/aventail-ssl-vpn/\nIn the top right corner of my screen (next to my username, date, and other icons), there is a black rectangular shaped icon with white vertical lines going through it. When I click on it now, a drop down menu with \"VPN is not configured\" (not clickable), and \"Open Network Preferences\" appears. I am almost certain that this was not like this before (it said something different, but I don’t remember what it was). I don't know how or if that might be relevant. This was one of the original clues that made me investigate further.\nMy google research tells me that there are a few programs listed in the list that monitor activity. Strangely, I saw a few of them on lists that were posted in similar documents elsewhere on the internet. I’m not sure why that’s the case or what it means about my specific situation.\nIt looks like this program Aventail was, in fact, run on my computer. After a google search told me that it has the ability to monitor activity via SSL VPN, I did a search in Finder for the term Aventail and found a few documents generated through the file recovery that seems to be relevant here. \nNothing new in the system turned up for the search term \"Aventail\", only documents in the file recovery. I assume this is because these documents were deleted and then recovered and also that the term isn't currently in my system (other than what's been deleted & recovered). \nThe next two documents (below) turned up in my file recovery that show her username associated with the software in question. I redacted parts of it for obvious reasons.\n #Uninstaller catalog, (c) Aventail Corporation\n #Sat Jul 28 15:33:31 EDT 2007\n https\\://ex1500.n****************.com/postauthOnDemand/ondemand_daemon_pkg.jar=/Users/**********/Library/Application Support/Aventail/ondemand/\n\nand then\n #!/bin/bash\n # Uninstaller script for Aventail OnDemand Daemon.\n # This script removes all files associated with the Aventail OnDemand Daemon.\n # Please copy this file to your home directory before executing it.\n echo \"\"\n echo \"***Aventail OnDemand Daemon Uninstaller***\"\n echo \"\"\n echo \"You need to have Administrator privileges on this computer to\"\n echo \"complete the operation.\"\n #echo \"\"\n #echo -n \"Do you wish to proceed with the uninstallation [y/n]: \"\n #read RESPONSE\n\n #if [ \"$RESPONSE\" != \"y\" ]; then\n #    exit 0\n #fi\n\n OSX_V4_STARTUP_DIR=\"/Library/StartupItems/OnDemand\"\n OSX_V3_STARTUP_DIR=\"/System/Library/StartupItems/OnDemand\"\n OD_EXEC_DIR=\"/var/Aventail/ondemand\"\n OD_HOME_DIR=\"$HOME/Library/Application Support/Aventail/ondemand\"\n INSTALL_FOUND=\"false\"\n\n # If the daemon is already running then stop it\n DAEMON_PID=`ps -axww | grep -v grep | grep \"ODService\" | awk '{print $1}'`\n if [ $DAEMON_PID ]; then\n INSTALL_FOUND=\"true\"\nsudo kill $DAEMON_PID\nfi \n\n # Remove files from the /Library/StartupItems folder if on Mac OS X v4\n if [ -d $OSX_V4_STARTUP_DIR ]; then\n INSTALL_FOUND=\"true\"\n sudo rm -rf $OSX_V4_STARTUP_DIR\n fi\n\n # Remove files from the System/Library/StartupItems folder if on Mac OS X v3 \n if [ -d $OSX_V3_STARTUP_DIR ]; then\n INSTALL_FOUND=\"true\"\n sudo rm -rf $OSX_V3_STARTUP_DIR\n fi\n # Remove files from the Aventail OnDemand Daemon execution directory\n if [ -d $OD_EXEC_DIR ]; then\n INSTALL_FOUND=\"true\"\n sudo rm -rf $OD_EXEC_DIR\n fi\n # Remove files from the Aventail OnDemand Daemon home directory\n if [ -d \"$OD_HOME_DIR\" ]; then\n INSTALL_FOUND=\"true\"\n sudo rm -rf \"$OD_HOME_DIR\"\n fi  \n\n if [ \"$INSTALL_FOUND\" == \"true\" ]; then\n# Expire sudo timestamp\nsudo -k\nelse\necho \"\"\necho \"No installation of Aventail OnDemand Daemon was found on your computer.\"\nfi\n\nThe next document looks a little different than the Plist. This one turned up by searching for the term “hamachi”. Once again, this only turned up in recovered documents and nowhere else.\n<key>BuildMachineOSBuild</key>\n<string>15E55</string>\n<key>CFBundleDevelopmentRegion</key>\n<string>English</string>\n<key>CFBundleExecutable</key>\n<string>AMD7000Controller</string>\n<key>CFBundleGetInfoString</key>\n<string>AMD7000Controller

have likely used a different process for accomplishing what I'm trying to do, but let's say that you did--if you saw these results, what items would be cause for alarm and/or indicative that your data was transferred or was being looked over by someone other than yourself?\n\nA: The posted plist is /System/Library/Extensions/AppleKextExcludeList.kext/Contents/Info.plist.\nIt contains a long list of kernel extensions. The purpose of AppleKextExcludeList.kext is to prevent the loading of the listed kexts in Sierra (based on their hashes or their names) because they are outdated, malicious or cause kernel panics. The AppleKextExcludeList.kext is a package installed by the macOS system installer and updated regularly (last update: Dec 18th, 2016).\nThe second file is an uninstaller bash script for the Aventail OnDemand Daemon. If you run the script with with sudo /path/to/script.sh Aventail OnDemand Daemon should be removed from your system. It may also be part of an Aventail Uninstaller.app which - once launched - executes the script.\n\nNeither file is suitable to compromise your system nor are they good indicators that your system has been compromised or is/has been monitored.\n\nTo check if your system is actively monitored would require to install a lot of software and/or observe the behavior of the file system and the network activity. To explain this is far beyond the scope of your question.\nFurther reading (arbitrary non-pro sources after a quick and sloppy Google search):\n\n\n*\n\n*Is your computer being monitored?\n\n*How to know if Mac OS X machine is being remotely viewed?\n\n*How Can You See If Someone Is Spying on Your Mac Computer?\n", "Q: OneDrive folder keeps moving to bottom of Finder Favorites sidebar In my favorites sidebar, my OneDrive Folder keeps moving back at the bottom of the favorite list each time I reboot.\nCan I make sure that it remains on top of my list of favorites on the sidebar of my Finder?\n\nA: This was bugging me as well, until I noticed one of my Macs didn't move it to the bottom. The difference? On that Mac, OneDrive was installed via the App Store, whereas the others were downloaded from the OneDrive web site. \nSo I uninstalled OneDrive from those affected Macs, reinstalled it from the App Store, and made sure I re-enabled the Finder Extension. Now after a restart, the OneDrive folder stays where I placed it in the Favorites side bar! :)\n\nA: OneDrive's icon is dynamically added by the app itself, you might be able to get to behave by turning the feature off, restarting and turning the feature back on. Otherwise, its in the way Microsoft are managing the icon. Dropbox seems to handle this by using a real folder instead of a virtual one, and Finder can therefore manage the sidebar item correctly.\n", "Q: Replace in files AND count number of replacements? I use the following line to replace a string in files:\nag -Q -l \"$1\" | xargs sed -i '' \"s/$1/$2/g\"\n\nag is the_silver_searcher, of course.\nHow can I also count the number of files that were affected by this change?\n\nA: You could use tee in the pipe line and create a temporary file, then run wc -l to count the number of files (lines).\nag -Q -l \"$1\" | tee -a /tmp/num | xargs sed -i '' \"s/$1/$2/g\"; wc -l /tmp/num; rm /tmp/num\n\n", "Q: bash file to detect chrome installation I need to create a bash file that executes google chrome (if installed) with some flags and an input file. Does someone know how to detect chrome installation and path via a bash file?\n\nA: This will check if Chrome is installed in the default location, then open a file at a path with arguments you have set.\nCHROMEPATH=\"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\"\nif [ -x \"$CHROMEPATH\" ]; then\n    \"$CHROMEPATH\" file:///path/to/file --yourargs\nfi\n\n", "Q: iPad 2 won't charge and turn on My iPad won't turn on and when I try to charge it only the red filler icon (battery icon ) display. The red filler keep blinking three times and then the screen went black. Its keep doing the same thing again again and I even let it charge for more than 2 hours but it won't turn on or charging. This happen suddenly cause usually when the battery died then I charge it, it work. But now it happen like this. Someone please give me advice or what can I do to my iPad ? And what it's problem...\n\nA: That's classic symptoms of a working iPad, working charge circuitry and a rechargeable Lithium based battery that can no longer take a charge.\nDepending on your budget this might be worth paying for a repair or paying for parts and learning about the process to replace a battery. Keep in mind - lithium cells can be fire hazards and if you modify your iPad - it could present a fire hazard if both the old and new battery aren't handled carefully and all safety features aren't correctly reconnected or present in the replacement parts.\n", "Q: Does macOS keep a log of all access to the keychain? I want to see which applications accessed my keychain of my Mac. Do know which apps have access and how often they do. Does macOS keep a log of that somewhere ?\n\nA: Yes, on MacOS Sierra or newer you can monitor every access to the Keychain, using the Unified Logging system in two operation modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Realtime\n\n*Query the database log to get past access events\n\nUse this command on a Terminal window for Realtime monitoring:\nlog stream --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.securityd\" AND message CONTAINS[cd] \"Keychain Access\"' --info --debug --signpost --style compact\n\nHere is the output of the above command, in realtime, while some keychain items were being accessed:\n\nYou can also query past events by specifying some date range, and changing stream to show. Like the example below:\nlog show --start \"2019-08-11 14:21:45\" --end \"2019-08-11 14:22:00\" --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.securityd\" AND message CONTAINS[cd] \"Keychain Access\"' --info --debug --signpost --style compact\n\nMore detailed information can be obtained by modifying the command line and grouping other process interactions. See man log for more options, or just ask here :)\n", "Q: Tracking with find my iphone Can I see on \"find my iphone\" a sort of tracking of where my iphone has been for a day? For exampel Between 1 and 5 pm my iphone were on this addresses..etc\n\nA: it does not show history but if the device is shut off or location services disabled, find my iPhone will show the last known location of your device\n\nA: No - Apple's Find My iPhone lists only one data point for each device.\nIt doesn't show history so you'd need to record location periodically and store the results elsewhere to do that.\n", "Q: IMAP emails disappearing from Apple mail on one computer when moved on another! I have an IMAP email account active on both my home and work computers (both Macs). The problem I am having is that when the emails are downloaded onto both computers from the server, if I delete an email or move it to a folder, on one Mac, it then disappears completely from the Inbox on the other one! The two computers are not linked in any way, and the email account is set up exactly the same on both computers using the same username and password. I can’t see any setting that gives an indication that it will delete an email if it is moved from the Inbox of another computer.  Also, other colleagues who have the same email account set up on their computers, don’t lose any emails from their Inboxes when I move them from mine. They, however, are using Windows PCs not Macs.  Any thoughts or help would be much appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: I'm sorry but you're getting it wrong. This is the expected behavior of IMAP. IMAP is to keep all devices synced with the server. That means, if you delete an email on one computer, it eventually disappears from all the others. If you mark something as read on one computer, it eventually gets marked as read on all of the others. I hope this clears things up. \n\nA: I would suggest that your colleagues are likely setup to use POP3, and not IMAP. POP3 does not synchronize, IMAP does. \n", "Q: How to speed up my iMac after upgrading to Sierra? I have this:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2012)\n\n*2,7 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n*16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M 512 MB\n\n\nSome days ago I updated to Sierra 10.12.6, and all my apps. My HD currently have about 350 GB free space.\nStill, it runs quite slow after upgrading from El Capitan to Sierra.\nAny of you had the same issue? How to solve?\n\nA: Putting an SSD inside will give the most speed boost possible for general computing. If you have a specific benchmark or measurement you want to optimize, there might be other options. \nSince that’s an internal upgrade, you should consider what value you can recoup selling it used and buy a better / newer used Mac than trying to upgrade internal parts on most iMac. \nSince you have a hard drive, you will get the best performance with a hundred free GB and rebooting once a week or so. Other than that, watching for RAM hogs and keeping browser tabs under control are good tips as well. \n\nA: Maxing out the RAM and especially a large, modern SSD are certainly options to consider.\nHowever, the way you described your setup there will be probably quite a bit of cruft accumulated, caused by an upgrade over an existing installation and/or Migration Assistant afterwards.\nBefore throwing any money at it, you should try how the machine performs with a clean install. Given that you are still on rotating magnetic disks, any external drive to try this approach should not be so drastically different and give you an impression of the changes achievable.\nThat is radical, takes a while but is also easy. You may also try to analyse, what really causes the slowness in your current setup.\nIf the perceived slowness is in Sierra but not in El Capitan then it stands to reason that there is too much going on behind the scenes.\nFresh installs of 10.11 vs 10.12 are not that different in terms of perceived speed on this kind of hardware.\nIf you are successful with improvements on you current setup and want to keep the hardware: then by all means necessary, go an get an SSD (installed).\n\nA: Ok. For now I was able to make my machine run fast by cleaning up several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean up my desktop\n\n*Clean up/backup a lot of hard drive (now having about 40% free space, about 10% more than I had before)\n\n*Deactivate Time Machine\n\n*Cleaned up some login items I usually do no use so much, including Dropbox, sync and gdrive.\n\n*Deactivate effects and transparency on windows (System Preferences > Accessibility > Display)\nI don't know if it was one of the previous or all together. I also think that probably there were some background tasks running, probably for indexing, both from the system (Time Machine, Spotlight, file caching, etc..) and from sync or gdrive or I don't know.\nAnyway, now it is running really fast again.\n", "Q: Pair AirPods to tvOS 11 Using the public beta version of tvOS 11 on an AppleTV 4th-generation.\nHow to pair my AirPods ear buds? \nThis new version 11 is supposed to make easy work of pairing. But when I open the AirPods case next to the Apple TV, nothing happens. When I go to Settings > Video and Audio > Audio Output, all I see listed is \"Apple TV\" both when case is open nearby and when wearing the AirPods.\nThese AirPods are already paired with both my iPhone and Mac, without problems.\n\nA: Pick up your AirPods charging case and open it.\nPress and hold the pairing button on the back of the case.\nLaunch Settings on your Apple TV\nClick on Remotes and Devices.\nClick on Bluetooth.\nSelect your AirPods from the list.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207010\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/31128330#31128330\nhttps://www.imore.com/how-pair-your-airpods-apple-tv-android-and-other-bluetooth-devices\n\nA: Sign in to iCloud\nApple shares the Bluetooth pairing info between all your Apple devices and the AirPods via your iCloud account.\nOn Apple TV, check the settings to see if you have signed into iCloud. \nOnce signed in, your AirPods appear in the audio settings list of sound outputs. \nAlso, in tvOS 11, as I recall, you may see AirPods appear as a sound option when displaying the screen-top menu in the Home screen. More convenient way to activate them than going into the nested settings menuing system.\n", "Q: Why is networking slow to start up after exiting the screensaver? For the past month, networking on my iMac has had strange behavior after waking up from the screensaver. For example, the first website that I visit in Google Chrome (after exiting the screensaver) displays an error page at first:\nThere is no internet connection\n...\nERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED\n\nThen, if I don't touch anything, a few seconds later, the error page refreshes and the browser connects to the website normally. This didn't used to happen. Safari does it too.\nAfterward, all web browsing and networking are normal, until the next time the Mac sits idle and the screensaver activates. Then the behavior repeats.\nI've also noticed that incoming network connections have a similar symptom. The first time I \"ssh\" or use a VNC client to connect to this iMac (after the screensaver has kicked in and some hours have passed), it takes many seconds to connect, but a second connection attempt is instant.\nAnybody know why this happens and how I can fix it?\nThis is MacOS 10.12.6 with the latest Google Chrome.\n\nA: It could be that when asleep your wifi become disconnected. When you then try to connect the 1st time it thinks there is no connection. After a few seconds, the wifi is restored and pages load. I don't know how to prevent it from disconnecting. I'm still working on that.\n", "Q: MagSafe 1 or 2 for MacBook Pro 2015 I have a 2015 MacBook Pro and need to know if I should be using a MagSafe 1 or 2 charger. I've searched around with Google but so far I've found conflicting information.\nI recently ordered an 85W MagSafe 2 (T-style) car charger and while the green light comes on showing power coming in, the menubar battery doesn't show the lighting bolt in the UI.\nNeed to know if it is just defective or if I'm buying the wrong charger.\n\nA: Those two styles for the glorious magsafes are physically different. If it fits without an adapter you have the right prong for your machine.\nAn overview for which Apple (don't call it)laptop mobile devices need which can be found here.\nThe menubar not reflecting what the charger is telling you may be caused by something else. \nYou indicated that your charger is declared as having the right power rating. Since it is apparently not an Apple product giving you problems, you might want to check if it really delivers the amount of power adversed. \nTrying an SMC reset and making sure the connector for the charger on the MBP is clean would be the next steps. Defective chargers cannot be ruled out entirely. Since it's new, go let it be checked out.\n\nA: According to Apple, you're using the right adapter (the MagSafe 2 connector). According to this page, the MBPs that you should use are:\n\n85W MagSafe power adapter with MagSafe 2 style connector\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15 inch, Mid 2015)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)\n\n*Macbook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012)\n\n\nand\n\n60W MagSafe power adapter with MagSafe 2 style connector\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2013)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012)\n\n\nIf your MBP still isn't charging, try the SMC reset (as mentioned by @LangLangC) and/or bring it into an Apple store to confirm whether the problem is with your laptop. Another thing to try is finding a friend/co-worker that has a MagSafe 2 adapter to confirm whether your power charger is working.\n", "Q: Installing an Apple TV 4 app on Apple TV 2 I have seen easy methods to jailbreak apple tv 2. I would like to know if anyone has tried to manually install an apple tv 4 app on a jailbroken apple tv 2. Is that possible at all? \nSpecific example: Bell Canada has introduced its Fibe Alt TV app to be used only on apple tv v4, I was wondering if that could be manually installed on an apple tv 2, or, I have to buy an Apple tv 4 anyways!\n\nA: No, is the short answer.\nApple TV gen 2 and Apple TV 4 run completely different operating systems. There is no compatibility in software between them.\n", "Q: Will encrypting the Windows partition with BitLocker wipe out the macOS partition? I am running macOS and Windows on a macbook pro using bootcamp.\nI have encrypted my macOS partition using FileVault.\nI have read, that BitLocker on Windows on Mac would wipe the macOS partition. Is there any truth to that?\nWhat is the best way to also encrypt the Windows partition?\nI am running macOS sierra.\n\nA: On a Mac, via BootCamp, BitLocker will only encrypt the Windows' system volume (drive C:). So MacOS will not be modified.\nOf course, accessing your BitLocker encrypted volume when you are using your computer with MacOS is another matter. There are software doing this.\n\nA: I provided a guide on enabling Bitlocker on your Bootcamp and/or Parallels partition here: Enabling BitLocker without TPM on MacBook Pro with Bootcamp\n", "Q: How to take a screenshot on iPhone X? As there is no Home button on iPhone X, how do you take a screenshot?\nSwiping up from bottom of the screen while pressing the lock button?\n\nA: Two Methods i found on Google,\nMethod 1:\nUsing Press, Side Button + Volume Up button at once.\nSource: Take a Screenshot on iPhone X: Alternate Ways\nMethod 2:\nUsing Assistive touch, Really great for use on lock screen, Home screen or App Screen.\n\nA: Hold the Side button and tap Volume Up.\n\n#iPhoneX screenshot: Side button + Volume up\n\nhttps://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/907736291726336000\n\nA: You apparently can do it by pressing the sleep/wake and the volume up button at the same time. Nevertheless, you can still take a screenshot with Assistive Touch in settings.\n\nA: One alternative way could be to use the new screen recording feature in iOS 11, and then from the video choose the image of choice.\n", "Q: Why does Siri need to know \"which John?\" for a reminder or calendar event? Me to Siri: \"add to my calendar Tuesday noon meeting with John\"\nSiri: \"which John?\"\n...and then you can't proceed without picking a contact from the list. I'm afraid Siri is going to send a calendar invite or something to whichever contact I pick. I try to avoid using names now, or use funny names I know aren't in my contacts. Why does Siri need to know \"which John\"? Just add it to my calendar! \n\nA: Siri can add attendees to calendar events. When creating an event, saying ‘with John’ will add John as an attendee to the event, shown in the event attendees section in the Calendar app later. If you have multiple Johns, it'll ask which one you mean so as to not get it wrong. There isn't a way to disable this functionality as it's part of Siri's calendar functions.\n", "Q: Will Face ID work in the dark? With the announcement of Face ID, I wonder, will work in the dark? For example, a dark room? Does the screen allow enough light for it to work?\n\nA: Face ID works in the dark thanks to the flood illuminator. This means Face ID is not dependent on external light sources or purely the light emitted from the display.\n\nFlood Illuminator\nInvisible infrared light helps identify your face even when it’s dark.\n\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/iphone-x/#face-id\n", "Q: Is it called iPhone \"X\" or iPhone 10? Going with Apple's history it was OS X (standing for OS 10) in older versions of Apple's operating system.\nSo with the new iPhone should I be calling iPhone \"X\" or iPhone 10?\nWhat did they use in the announcements?\n\nA: The device is called iPhone X, pronounced iPhone 10.\nThe pronunciation follows on from (Mac) OS X being pronounced 10. In the special event, the announcement called the device out loud as ‘iPhone 10’. This is continued in the Apple video ‘Introducing iPhone X’.\n\nThis screenshot is showing the YouTube generated subtitles, as the manually written subtitles print ‘iPhone X’, which is what it's called but not how it's pronounced.\n\nA: its called the iphone 10 but they use x as roman numerals \n", "Q: How do I uninstall iCloud extras on a Windows machine? I recently bought a Mac for some iOS development, which of course requires an Apple ID and gives you iCloud. I wanted to move some files from my Windows machine to iCloud and saw that there is a Windows iCloud app so I installed.\nUnlike Google Drive, DropBox, Box, or OneDrive, iCloud installed a bunch of other applications that duplicate functionality I already have, namely Calendar, Contacts, Find My iPhone, iCloudPhotos, Keynote, Mail, Notes, Numbers, Pages, and Reminders.\nAll I wanted was the cloud drive! How do I remove all this unwanted bloat?\n\nA: iCloud doesn't install other applications, it just provides the ability to set up sync services with your existing applications and those iCloud services. In iCloud Control Panel, turn off those services using the checkboxes to not use those services in applications.\n", "Q: How do I trigger reachability in iPhone X? As we all have seen that the iPhone X is gorgeous with all its bezel less design and no home button. But it adds to the question of how do I go about reachability?

I got a Macbook Air 13\" mid-2011 (A1369) from a friend who disposed it years ago. He said it was \"broken\", and a technician told him it wasn't worth the repair. He's not an expert, and couldn't give me any other useful details. Now he gave it to me, I'm looking if I can fix it. \nWhen I push to power button I can't hear the usual chime and the notebook doesn't turn on. Connecting a working power adapter it doesn't seem to charge - no lights on the magsafe connector. My guess first guess was that the battery may be broken.\nToday I opened it, and found the SSD missing. \nSo my question: Can this Macbook Air turn on without any SSD installed?\nIs it possible that it doesn't turn on because there's no SSD installed? \nActually, I'd like to try anything before spending money on a SSD that I can't use elsewhere. Battery replacements are cheap, but SSD drives are expensive.\n\nA: You don't need an internal drive for a MacBook Air (any Mac for that matter) to boot; you can boot off an external drive.\nYou also don't need a battery to turn on a MacBook (plain, Air or Pro).  Plugging in the MagSafe will just show an amber led, not green.\nIt doesn't turn on because there's something more serious wrong with it.  It's most likely, the SSD was removed for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Salvage the user's data\n\n*sell on the secondary market\n\n\nThere are many logic board repair services available, you may want to check them out because it's most likely a logic board issue.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install a custom ringtone using iTunes 12.7 or later? Is it possible to install a custom ringtone on an iPhone running iOS  11 using iTunes 12.7 or later?\nIf so, how?\n\nA: Yes. You can manually drag your ringtones into the device connected with iTunes.\n\nApple has an updated article here.\n\nA: I confirm the answer by Cykor: once installed the iTunes 12.7 version, and with a device connected, there is no more a \"Ringtones\" section under the selected device; but dragging a .m4r file over the device sends that file to the device. That file will be usable as a ringtone for any event or contact. If the file is not the correct format or size (too long, for example) an error window will appear.\n", "Q: iOS 11 Takes Tons of Storage Storage shows that System takes about 12 Gb of storage.\nAnyone else have System taking up 12 GB after installing, and know how to fix it?\nEdit: storage taken up by system keeps rising. Reaching 13 GB.\n\n\niPhone SE.\n  Restart didn't help.\n\n\nA: Pretty simple triage - the “system” either now contains an iOS update cached or a lot of user data, but you can convince yourself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the device\n\n*Erase all content and settings\n\n\nMeasure the space. If you feel it’s still taking a lot of space, put the device in recovery mode and restore it.\nOnce you’re OK with the space usage of the bare system, erase one more time and restore from your backup of choice or just sign in and set it up new if you want to start fresh.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 counts 300 times more steps My iPhone with iOS 10.3 is counting more than 300 times more steps than usual.

If a user goes outside with the Apple Watch Series 3 and keeps their iPhone at home, how will the calling feature work?\n\nA: The Apple Watch Series 3 GPS + Cellular has LTE built-in. Here are the bands supported by the USA version:\n\nLTE\n  2 (1900 MHz)\n  4 (AWS)\n  5 (850 MHz)\n  12 (700 MHz)\n  13 (700c MHz)\n  17 (700b MHz)\n  18 (800 MHz)\n  19 (800 MHz)\n  25 (1900 MHz)\n  26 (800 MHz)\n  41 (TD 2500)  \nUMTS\n  800 MHz\n  850 MHz\n  1700 MHz\n  1900 MHz  \n\nSOURCE\nThat same page also lists the bands for other countries.\n\nA: The most relevant part to making the Apple Watch 3 (with Cellular) work without having your iPhone nearby is the eSIM (electronic SIM* or Subscriber Identity Module).\nObviously, having LTE capability is important, but what sets it apart is the eSIM's ability to share your existing wireless account info including the phone number and data plan. \n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Watch 3’s eSIM is that\n  it’ll share your iPhone’s number. You can think of them as part of the\n  same connection. However, this also means it’ll only work with an\n  iPhone – and that your iPhone and Apple Watch will have to be with the\n  same network provider.\n\nFrom: What is an eSIM? The Apple Watch Series 3’s new SIM tech explained\nWhen you have this capability, the Apple Watch appears to the carrier as just another device and when a call comes it, will route it to both the iPhone and Watch.\nYou also have this ability with respect to data, incoming and outgoing traffic gets authenticated to the network as any other device would which is how you can stream music while you run without carrying your phone.\nThere is a limitation however. Your device and your carrier must support this technology.  You also cannot have a data plan  on carrier A and voice/text on carrier B.  \n\n* A subscriber identity module or subscriber identification module (SIM) is an integrated circuit that is intended to securely store the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile telephony devices (such as mobile phones and computers). It is also possible to store contact information on many SIM cards.

Along the lines of this question—if you take a screenshot on an iPhone X, how is the camera cutout at the top of the screen handled? Is there just a black region of the appropriate shape and size at the top of the image?\n\nA: The simulator behaves differently to an actual device. Screenshots from a real device do not have a cutout, nor rounded corners.\n\nScreenshots taken on iPhone X ignore the existence of the notch\n\n\nGuilherme Rambo on Twitter https://twitter.com/_inside/status/907743049220018176\n\nA: This is what I get when I take a screenshot from iPhone X simulator.

And I frequently use windows that need to span multiple monitors which means I HAVE to have the Mission Control option turned off for \"Displays have separate Spaces\".  The problem is when disabling \"Displays have separate Spaces\" and entering fullscreen youtube the dock and menu are hidden, this makes continuing to work much harder.\nSo to be clear, I'm looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dock and menu stay on the screen while youtube is fullscreen on monitor #1\n\n*While still keeping the ability to open a single window that can span across monitor #2 and #3.\n\n\nSomeone please save me!  Even if I have to purchase and app that addresses this for me!\n\nA: Didn't want to write like 4 comments so here's an answer.\nFinally things are starting to make sense. The word fullscreen mixed with Displays have separate spaces option deceived me and kept me in a headspace I couldn't get out off. I was thinking of the OS X fullscreen... We can pretty much forget everything I've said so far.\nIt is definitely super weird that for you, it is acting the way most people want it to work... and there is seemingly no way to make it work the way it works for you... Yet, here we are. \nSince I super don't have a fix for that issue. I'm going to try and offer a workaround. \n\nWorkaround:\nLike I suggested before, maybe the simplest solution would be a chrome extension. I'd actually maybe recommend Floating Player. Basically opens the video in current page in its own window with only the title bar of the gui remaining. \nThen if you resize it to fill  the whole screen (maximize it), you should be good to go. \n\nMaximizing a window\nSince OS X Yosemite, clicking the green ball on the top left puts the application window in Fullscreen mode. You don't want that. To actually just maximize a window, you need to hold down Opt/Alt when clicking it. Or double click the title bar. This unfortunately is a bit of a mixed bag... Some applications, including Chrome, maximizes the window by making it full height, but not full width. So maybe don't use that either.\nThe best way to maximize a window or manage window position and size is to use third party applications. I'd recommend you try out Moom. It's definitely one of the best ones out there, if not the best one. If you don't want to pay anything, I'd say the next best free window manager app is probably Spectacle. \n", "Q: Do AirPods charge batteries with Qi now?

When iPhone 6 came out, the non-updated apps in app store were stretched/scaled up with same aspect ratio.\nHow will the current apps in the app store scale on iPhone X? I.e. without rebuilding them with SDK 11 / Xcode9.\nThe only realistic option I can think about for iPhone X is that the full screen will not be used? I.e. same aspect ratio as the iPhone 6 & 7.\nWhat makes me think that it will be some kind of \"shrinked area\" for the iPhone X+SDK10 is that almost ALL apps in the appstore will be broken for iPhone X unless the apps get updated within a month. In reality - This will not happen. Alot of apps will not be updated at the date of iPhone X release.\nEDIT:\nTo clarify, I don't ask for how the apps will look when rebuilt with xcode9/SDK11. I want to know how the apps behave without rebuilding them!\n\nA: Right now most of the apps are made with Auto Layout, so they are not going to be \"scaled\" but rather position of the items may be different. The biggest problem is to handle the top area of the display. I checked some of the apps in the iPhoneX Simulator and apps that display status bar do not have any problems. With status bar hidden and without navigation bar there could be problems. Here's the Hero Sample app from YiLun Zhao :\n\nAs you can see, Tab bar is \"stretched\" downward, but top scrolled area is displayed rather strange. For example section separators are displayed under the \"status area\" (bottom of it), but table content is clearly visible underneath (side by side with black camera area).\nI checked some other apps and there are no major problems with the UI.\nSo the answer to your question is - it depends how developers made their apps. If they've used Auto Layout there shouldn't be a problem.\nP.S. even though the display is bigger than iPhones Plus it has \"compact\" horizontal traits in landscape -> there won't be split view.

You will begin to take new photos in HEIC format once all of your iCloud synced devices in iOS and macOS have a version of the os and Photos app to support the new compression formats. \nThen, images will begin to collect in the new format. Presumably over time, it might get added either a until it’s to process or just a feature to go back and evaluate / reprocess the images if the potential savings are substantial. \nMy hunch is that this would first be used with people using iCloud photo libraries and enabling the reduce file space option on some devices that then actually need space.

If you're looking for Apps, Tones, or Books (for Windows) that previously\n  appeared in your iTunes library, you can find them in your iTunes\n  media folder.\n  \n*Drag the item from your computer to your iOS device in the left sidebar of iTunes.\n  \n  \n  \n\n\nA: Yesterday (almost a month after my initial question), Apple quietly released iTunes 12.6.3 - a build of iTunes with the same iOS management features as previous builds before iTunes 12.7: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446572/apple-itunes-12-6-3-app-support\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208079 \nIf you've already installed a newer version of iTunes, you can download this version of iTunes on your Mac, PC 32-bit or PC 64-bit* and run the installer. After installation is complete, you can continue to deploy apps with iTunes.  \nYou won’t be prompted to download new versions of iTunes after you install this version. Learn how to update to the latest version of iTunes when you're ready to upgrade manually.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Mac\n  \n*Windows 32-bit\n  \n*Windows 64-bit\n\nSo it seems Apple does recognize that their customers need the ability to manage iOS apps from a desktop - but their language implies this is not a long-term solution (i.e. having two separate branches of iTunes). I wonder if they're working on first-class iOS management tool for desktops, like iSync, but for Windows.\n\nA: If you have a Mac, the ability to load .ipa files is still available in Apple Configurator 2. After you connect your device, Add button -> Apps -> Choose from my Mac...\nTo download .ipa's from the App Store, see How do I download an iOS App (IPA) file to my Mac after iTunes 12.7 update?\nFor reference, you have not been able to save .ipa files from a device since iOS 9, see Can't transfer purchases from iPhone to iTunes in iOS 9\n", "Q: Can't open News app after changing region/country After changing region/country, News can't be opened.\nApp Store shows installed, with \"Open\" button next to the App.\nTapping on it does nothing.\nAsking Siri to open it, Siri says \"can't right now\".\nI'm using an iPhone SE and the storage is not full.\nThe widget shows. Tapping on articles (in widget) opens Safari.\nAnyone else had this, and solved it?\n\n\nA: News App has been limited to specific countries.\nYou can change your country under Settings > General > Language & Region > Region to keep using News, if your country no longer has access to it otherwise.\n\nNote: you can always use the App's widget in other countries.\n\nMore:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202329 (Apple's page about News)\n\n*https://www.imore.com/how-get-apple-news-uk-australia-canada-and-more (an article explaining how to change your country in Settings)\n\n\nA: About the best troubleshooting for an installed app is:\n\n\n*\n\n*put device in Airplane mode\n\n*power off device\n\n*power on device\n\n*try app\n\n*if it fails - open up settings and be sure you have 1 GB of free space and restart again in Airplane mode\n\n*if things still fail - consider enabling networking and check for updates.\n\n\nBarring that - you can either delete the app and reinstall it or consider making a backup and erasing all content and settings. Then try a vanilla device with no iCloud, no personalization.\n\nA: The News app cant handle a region change, which is what it uses to decide what feeds can be accessed. After changing region in settings even if you can launch the app most feeds will say “this feed is not available in your region”. The solution is to uninstall the News app and then install it again from the App Store. This process clears out its preferences and allows it to work in the new region. Works on iOS 12.\n", "Q: Can I prevent Facebook from running in the background? I made the observation, that turning off Background App Refresh does NOT prevent Facebook and FB Messenger from receiving updates and giving me notifications and thus still run in the background. This awesome answer shed some light on the matter explaining that there are a quite a bunch of means for apps to run in the background unaffected by the Background App Refresh setting.\nHowever, I want to ask this question point blank: Is it not possible for the user to completely kill an app, meaning no background activity whatsoever, other than removing it from my device?\nThis is not about battery life or something, but about Facebook (or some other service) being able to track my (approximate) location based on my IP address.\n\nA: In the iOS device:\nyou can go to settings > general > Background App Refresh and try to disable Facebook\nIn Facebook:\nto disable Location in Facebook settings > account Settings > location > location chose Never\nhope with does 2 options I can give you the answer you want\n", "Q: How to view a photo marked up in iOS on my laptop ? (.AAE file) I've taken a couple of photos on my iPhone 5s running iOS 10 and annotated them using the built-in markup feature. \nThe photos look fine when viewed on the iPhone but when I transferred them to my laptop (MacBook Pro 15-inch, Mid 2012, running 10.10.5) via the Image Capture utility it imported all of the photos, but they where not marked up, instead for each photo I got an accompanying .AAE file, which I presume is the markup overlay. \nHow can I get the photo to save as a JPEG with the markup already overlaid ? \n\nA: iOS overlays the markup as saved in the .AAE file. Whenever you see the photo the markups will be overlaid.\nSolution 1\nWhen you send the photo to your MacBook Pro using AirDrop, a new image (the original image and the markup) will be generated on-the-fly and sent to your Mac with all markups intact.\nFor this to work you need a \"MacBook Pro (Late 2008) or later, excluding the MacBook Pro (17-inch, Late 2008)\". See Apple.com.\nSolution 2\nIf you are not able to use AirDrop with your Mac, you may create a Shared Photo album with iOS' Photo.app. As soon as the shared image appears in the new album you can save it to your camera roll with all markups applied. Please note that the resolution of these photos will be reduced to fit 2048 px x 2048 px.\nSolution 3\nUse Photos.app on your Mac. If both the image file and the .AAE file are in the same folder they both get imported. You will see all markups applied in Photos.app.\nTo export an image with these markups applied just drag it to your Desktop or any other folder.\n", "Q: Subtract files in folder A from folder B I've got folder A with 8000 images and folder B with 9000 images. Folder B contains the 8000 images from folder A as well as additional 1000 images. I would like to delete the 8000 images which are already in Folder A, leaving only the \"new\" 1000 images. \nDoes anyone know an elegant way to get the job done? (btw. I can not sort them by date and get the newer ones)\n\nA: You can use a simple bash script to do this::\nfor file in *.*; do if [ -f \"/FolderA/${file}\" ]; then rm \"/FolderB/$file\"; fi; done;\n\nThis script assumes you are already in FolderB, which is where you want to delete the files that already exist in FolderA.\nYou can tweak it if you know the extension of the image files (ie, .png, .gif, etc) and you have the exact folder names. So instead of *.* you can use *.png or *.gif.\nA MUCH safer version:\nfor file in *.*; do if [ -f \"/FolderA/${file}\" ]; then mv \"/FolderB/$file\" ~/.Trash; fi; done;\n\nThis will move the file to the Trash.  Using rm is a one-way-street.  Once you hit enter on an rm command, it's done; that file is gone forever.  Move to the Trash to ensure you got the results you are looking for.\n\nA: If you have installed the GNU findutils via homebrew, you can cd to folderB in the terminal and enter\necho rm $(find /path/to/folderA -type f -printf \"%P\\n\")\n\nCheck the output. If it lists the files you want to get deleted, repeat without the echo to actually remove the files.\nThe default find of the system doesn't have -printf, but writing\necho rm $(find /path/to/folderA -type f -execdir {} \\; )\n\n(also issued from folderB!) should do the same job (can't test that here).\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a duplicate of folder A: A-copy.\n\n*Open Terminal and enter touch -mt 200001010000 /path/to/A-copy/*.*\n\n*Move the files from A(copy) to B and replace existing files there.\n\n*Sort the files in folder B by modification date.\n\n*Remove all files with the mod date January 1st, 2000 in folder B\n\n\nThis won't modify the mod dates of the original files in folder a.\n\nIf folder A already contains files with a January 1st, 2000 mod date choose another date in step 2.\n\nA: If folder B has all the images from folder A plus an additional 1000, then just delete folder A!\nSimples!\nHowever, if you have folder B has 9000 images and folder A has 9000 images but there is a disparity between them that folder B doesn't have all the images of folder A then use diff to find the difference.\nHaving said that, this will only be a file name difference. You might have two images that share the same name, which is an entirely different issue!\nThe code:\ndiff -rq folder1 folder2\n\nThe r tells diff to look at each directory recursively, including subdirectories. The q switch sets diff brief mode. If we didn’t set brief mode, diff would not only tell you which files are different between the two folders, but also show the actual line-by-line differences for any text files that exist in both locations but are not identical.\n\n", "Q: My calendar has a name?

Many older ways to do this required an active data connection as you would set the proxy for that interface manually to use a usb tcp tunnel. The host is a Mac running the macOS High Sierra developer preview. The idevice is an iPhone 4s running iOS 7.1.2 jailbroken. The way I have done it is as follows:\nCreate a pppd tunnel.

If you run anything lower than iOS 10, you should upgrade. iPhone X is running iOS 11, so it will have all the latest security updates.\nThis is a good example why you always need to update to the latest iOS version.

Now that Apple has removed the ability to access the iOS App Store in iTunes 12.7 on Mac/Windows (See MacRumors article), I can't find any way to download an IPA file from the App Store. As a note, I'm not worried about installing the IPA files (see \"How do I backup and restore my IPA app backups in iTunes 12.7?\"), I just need the IPA files as a developer looking for some basic information on the apps. I'd like to solve this without resorting to jailbreaking as my devices are already updated to iOS 10.3.3.\nHere are things that I've tried that didn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract from backup: The apps seem no longer to be backed up.\n\n*Save to Mac from iPhone management software: I believe this has been blocked by Apple works as far back as iOS 8.3.\n\n*Figuring out how the file is downloaded via proxy connection: At least for me, this looks too complicated to do because you have to authenticate with your Apple ID and I'm sure that by now, Apple even requires the phone to be authenticated in some way. Not sure if it would even be possible in the same way that you see all those Android APK download services out there.\n\n\nAt least for now, it looks to me like maybe the only way is to hold onto an older version of iTunes for as long as that works.\n\nA: This isn’t exactly what you want, but just to add this option too...\nIf you use the \"Apple Configurator 2\" app, you can still download and update apps from multiple Apple IDs - as you also could with iTunes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the device with USB\n\n*Sign in under Account:\n\n\n\n*Choose Update in the menu:\n\n\n\nA more detailed description can be found here: http://krypted.com/apple-configurator/upgrade-devices-and-apps-using-apple-configurator-2/\nThe Apps are downloaded to:\n~/Library/Group\\ Containers/K36BKF7T3D.group.com.apple.configurator/Library/Caches/Assets/TemporaryItems/MobileApps/\n\n\nA: Edit: iTunes 12.6.3 is no longer supported by macOS Mojave, Catalina or other later versions. The Apple support page notes this and the page is no longer being updated. Apple Configurator or other solutions must be used.\n\nThere is now another solution: Apple provides a version of iTunes (12.6.3) which supports new devices such as iPhone 8 and iPhone X which still retains the App Store.\nApple Configurator 2 works well for me, but I’m adding this answer for those who would prefer to use iTunes or can’t use Apple Configurator (Windows users)\nSource: https://9to5mac.com/2017/10/09/apple-itunes-apps-focused-removed-stopgap/\nDownload: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208079\nEdit: You can have iTunes 12.7 and iTunes 12.6.3 installed side-by-side.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install iTunes 12.6.3 from the links above.\n\n*Copy the iTunes app and paste it to where you want, rename if necessary.\n\n*Hold Option and double click iTunes. Create a new library in a separate location. iTunes 12.6.3 and iTunes 12.7 can't use the same library because iTunes 12.7 will update the file and iTunes 12.6.3 won't be able to understand it.\n\n*Manually download the latest iTunes from Apple's website and run the installer to update your main copy of iTunes.\n\n*(Optional) Change your iTunes 12.6.3 icon to a different icon to help distinguish between the two. (Right-click, Get Info, drag new icon onto existing icon).\n\n\nImportant: You will need to Option-Open each time you switch versions so that you can select the correct library and don't update the older library to 12.7 format.\n\nA: The Mac \"Apple Configurator 2\" Update button solution will work if you both have an older version on your iOS device or on your Mac, and a newer version is in the App store. \nIf the old version of the app is on your device, hit the \"Update\" button in the Configurator.  After the Configurator downloads the new version, an ipa file will Temporarily appear in a sub-sub-directory of the:\n~/Library/Group Containers/K36BKF7T3D.group.com.apple.configurator/Library/Caches/Assets/TemporaryItems/MobileApps\n\ndirectory.  Immediately copy the app .ipa file out of that directory to a safe place (remote storage, etc.) before doing anything else (such as quitting the Configurator app, etc.).\nIf an old version of the app is not on your device, but you have saved an old copy from your  ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications  directory, or other backup, you can first use the Configurator app to install the old app on your device by using: Add button > Apps > Choose from my Mac...

With Windows the OS & apps belong to the machine & changing the machine's owner is simple. With Apple, everything belongs to the original purchaser - tied to their Apple ID, & they can change machine, taking their purchases with them. They can't, however, give that software away, it is irrevocably tied to the original Apple ID. This includes the OS itself.\nYour best course of action is to completely wipe the machine & start over.\nAs a new owner of a blank second-hand Mac, the new OS you install will now belong to you.\nWhat to do before selling or giving away your Mac should already have been done by the previous owners - & frankly for a company to not wipe its old machines is really unsafe; who knows what sensitive information is still on there... or what spyware, viruses etc...\nStart from Step 5 on that page & completely erase & reinstall the OS. \n\nA: With respect to previous answers that point out that you don't own the OS or the apps on the computer they are (mostly) right. MacOS is free to use with a Mac. But the OS on the Mac you bought was registered under an AppleID owned by the company you bought the Mac from so updating it will be problematic without the AppleID and corresponding password.\nYou do not own the Apps installed on that Mac. Period. So updating them without resorting to unlawful copies and/or updaters will be impossible.\nActually removing a user profile is about as simple as it gets. Open System Preferences > Users & Groups and click the lock icon to authenticate yourself. Select the account you want to delete and click the \"-\" button at the bottom of the left column. You will be given a couple of options, to simply delete the profile or create a disk image of that profile. If you need none of the user specific data then just delete the profile. Repeat as necessary.\nPersonally I would do as previous answers have suggested, reinstall macOS after you wipe the hard drive. You then start with a clean slate that carries none of the cruft left behind by that Mac's previous users. \n\nA: The OS installed is not necessarily tied to any AppleID. It might be. If you walk out of a shop with a Mac from the shelf, it will not be associated with any ID. If you install the OS from a stick you prepared it will not be associated with any ID. Although that is the first thing Apple urges you to do once you start up the computer. Anyone can skip this process never associating the machine with any ID.\nThis OS can be updated just fine to the maximum version of the OS installed. \nAnd since this is an OS that came with the machine as bought, Apple not wanting money for this I fail to see any legal problem arising from that. Apple wants to sell you the hardware, which you bought, and to push content for which you have to pay again. The OS being just a free giveaway enabling  you to get in.\nTechnically, you can not update non-professional apps from the AppStore since that indeed requires giving the credentials for the AppleID that was used to download them. But again technically, you will most probably be able to update most of the professional (or real applications/programs) software installed on that system until said software is payware and hits the paid-upgrade threshold. Free/libre professional software can be amazing too and you will never have to pay for that, and you can update and upgrade those titles as freely and happily as you like. The OP never stated what kind of amazing software was meant. Legal reinstallation might just be a hassle etc. Reselling should be possible and legal everywhere, even with software that's now defined 'as a service' (meaning: 'just for rent').\nLegally you might have a problem with that subspecies of payware professional software. If the original owner sold you the software license as well you should be fine, but certain jurisdictions enforce the unethical business practices of forbidding just that. You may break the law in using that kind of software and if applicable you should strive to improve the legal situation for that by lobbying and urging to change that stupid law. \nBack on the Topic of your Actual Question\nLegally, technically  and ethically: yes, you can delete the files of other users/previous owners and you should delete them; but ethically you should not 'access' these files. Instead you should probably follow Steve's advice or just go to the folder /Users/ and select these folders there:\nadmin (admin) from old corporate IT department\nold user no. 1\nold user no. 2\n\nand delete them unseen. That should be possible either via Steve's method or just by dragging the folders there to the Trash. \nAnd finally, I agree that a complete wipe and clean install is probably by far the best option for even more reasons than already stated here.\n", "Q: How to know which one is used when charging a MacBook Pro with usb-c from multiple power adapters? There is this great question: What happens if you plug more than one charger in the new MacBook Pro (2016)? \nIt doesn't tell me how to find out from which source the MacBook is charging though.  Right this moment I have a power bank and a MacBook charger (small, not proper wattage) connected to my MacBook Pro and my battery is at 3%. I'd like to know which one I can unplug.\nIs there a way to know which port is giving the power? I'm looking for a precise answer, e.g. from a command line tool. It'd also be good to know with exactly how much Watt it's charging.\nI don't want to rely on whatever is indicated on the charger.\n\nA: The one that has the most power is the one that does the charging\nFrom Apple's support page Connect with Thunderbolt 3 on your new MacBook Pro (that was linked in the question), it states that\n\n  \n*\n  \n*If you connect multiple power supplies to your MacBook Pro, the one that provides the most power will be used, regardless of the order in\n  which you connected them.\n  \n\nYou need to check the specs of the power bank and the charger.  How many watts to each have.  To get this info, use the simple calculation:\nVolts = Watts x Amps\n\nIf you power bank give you 5V at 2A it's capable of delivering 10W.  If your charger is capable of 12V at 5A then it's capable of delivering 60W.  The one with the most is charging your Mac.\nMost likely, your power bank is nowhere close to an AC adapter - that's the one you should disconnect.\n", "Q: How to run a script if external IP is changed? How can I execute a bash script when the external IP is changed. I wonder if there is a hook in macOS to run such a script.\n\nA: Your computer has no way to detect by itself that the external IP has changed, as this is handled by the router that translates your private IP to the public one.\nSo you must poll either the router itself, or an external site.\nThe router can be interrogated through SNMP le if it supports this protocol.\nIf it doens't but has a command line (CLI) access then you can use it with a language like expect.\nIf the router is only accesible through a web interface, this is doable but more complex.\nYou can actually avoid polling if the router support sending SNMP traps or has an event handler, then it is the router that can notify you computer about the change, and then you run your script on reception of such notification.\n", "Q: Will old Apple Watch models work with AirPower?

I have several tens of gigabytes of iPhone and iPad apps inside my ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications directory.  What happens to the .ipa files in this directory after updating to iTunes 12.7?  Are the contents of this directory still updated after a Sync is performed with an iOS device that has new or updated apps installed?  Or does this directory just become wasted storage that should be cleaned up?\n\nA: Those no longer sync with iTunes so you can indeed delete them...\nhowever\nIf there is a 64bit orphaned or abandoned app that you still use or need that is no longer in the app store. Don't toss it as iTunes manual install (still supported) is the only way you'll ever be able to re-install it if you wipe your phone or move to a new one.\n\nA: As @SteveChambers mentioned above, you can delete the .ipa files.\nPer MacWorld:\n\nThe App Store in iTunes is kaput and there’s nothing you can do about,\n  so dry your tears and let’s move on. Apple doesn’t let it go neatly\n  out the door, however. After updating, I found that 5GB of “.ipa”\n  files—the file format for apps—remained in my home directory (in\n  ~/Music/iTunes Library/Mobile Applications/). You can throw those\n  away unless you’re nostalgic.\n\nThe .ipa files aren't removed after the iTunes 12.7 update, but there's no real use for these files any more unless you manually transfer the files to your device.\n", "Q: Where's the iTunes app section for my iPhone? I just updated itunes to 12.7.0.166 before making a backup of my iphone 5. To my surprise I can't find an apps section when configuring the phone in itunes, nor can I find the apps section in the itunes library itself. \nI'm confused. Have they removed that section in the update? If so, then that would make my backups useless -- there is no way to back up my apps. Transferring purchases from the phone does nothing, it just finishes immediately.\nI could not find an itunes changelog. \nDo I need to downgrade itunes to make a decent restore of my phone nowadays?\nUpdate:\nTo clarify, I have apps that are no longer available for download. There is no other option than itunes.\n\nA: You can find a overview/summary of iTunes 12.7 changes on this Apple support page. \nChanges include:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Apps: Looking for your past iOS app downloads? Learn how to redownload apps on your iOS device.\n  \n*iTunes U: Collections of iTunes U content appear in the Podcasts section of iTunes. \n  \n*Internet Radio: Your Internet Radio stations appear in your music library's sidebar. Click Edit in the sidebar to show or hide Internet\n  Radio.\n  \n*Ringtones: iOS 11 supports redownloading ringtones directly to your iOS device, without the need to use iTunes on your Mac or PC.\n  \n*Books on Windows: Books on iTunes for Windows are managed in iBooks for iOS. Learn how to redownload books on an iOS device.\n  \n  \n  If you have an iOS app, ringtone, or book that's no longer available\n  for redownload, you can move that content to your iOS device while\n  plugged in to a computer with a USB cable.\n\nAccording to MacWorld:\n\nWhere it will really hurt is if and when you need to restore an iPhone\n  or iPad. You can still perform iTunes backups, but the restore won’t\n  transfer apps from your Mac, but instead re-download them over the\n  Internet from Apple. That can easily consume gigabytes of bandwidth,\n  depending on your app choices. Many users download few apps, or those\n  apps that are relatively modest, and this won’t be as big a hit.\nThere’s no way to bypass or minimize this problem. If you have any kinds of restrictions on your internet service—whether in performance or limits—you should consider using a public Wi-Fi hotspot or the Wi-Fi of a friend without those limits. You’ll need to plan ahead when you wipe and want to restore an iOS device.\n\nSo to answer your question, that section (apps) has been removed from iTunes, and restoring apps will require redownloading via the AppStore in iOS. Plan on using Wi-Fi or a hotspot to prevent large data usage when redownloading apps.\n", "Q: What happens to 32-bit apps on a device after an iOS 11 update? I have several dozen 32-bit apps on my iPhone.  What happens to them after I update the device to iOS 11?\nIs there any way to save these 32-bit apps off of the device? (for use with a spare iPhone 5, for instance)\n\nA: The data and application are both left intact. If you try to tap on those apps, it takes you to the settings / App Store to contact the developer and explaining the app will not run. \nYou can pre check on iOS 10 in the settings app. \n\n\n*\n\n*General > About > Applications\n\n\n\n\nA: To answer the second part of the question, yes, if you have a version of iTunes prior to 12.7 which no longer syncs apps locally.\nThe files are stored in a subfolder of your iTunes folder and you should be able to transfer them to another phone as long as it uses the same AppleID as on the phone that it was downloaded for.\n", "Q: Country/region change in App Store on iPhone I am unable to change the country in my iPhone 6s in App Store. It requires credit/debit card information which I currently don't have. I want to download a free app.\n\nA: You will probably not be able to change country via your device due to this reason of it asking you to add CC details.\nYour next option is to log into Itunes on your pc change your country and there it will give u the \"none\" option .\nNow if u dont have that option available then u have an outstanding debt on your account from a previous purchase wether it was the last thing u brought or something previous to that.

And you do not see how to customise it until you hit an invisible spot to the right of the sidebar section title called \"Library\" when your sidebar is set to display \"Music\". Hovering to the right over an apparently empty spot then reveals an \"Edit\" option where you can then activate the \"Internet Radio\" setting. Click \"Done\" if you are done with your customisations in the same spot to re-hide that user-confuser and traditional \"Internet Radio\" will be in your sidebar again.\n\nThat gives you the old big list with a tree structure to choose from.\n\nAdding Custom URLs for Traditional \"Internet Radio\" Streams\nOpening a custom stream is accomplished by entering the URL in the box that appears when pressing Command+u or choosing the menu item File > Open Stream.\nAdding this permanently seems not possible.\nBut again: right-clicking into the info area (The Apple logo in the picture) reveals the option to \"Create Station\".\nInterestingly you can also create playlists with those streams to get them organised to your liking.\n\nThe new \"Apple Music\"-\"iTunes Store\"-\"Radio\"\nAn alternative to this method of interfacing to streams is a much more prominent store-like interface for radio stations that looks like it is somehow tied to Apple Music (this one requires from you to give up at least your AppleID or even subscribe to the \"Apple Music\" service):\n\nPossible restrictions for that are in iTunes Preferences as a subset under \"iTunes Store\" and a part of \"Apple Music\".\n", "Q: How can I use a Keyboard Shortcut to tag files?

When powering on, the log on screen appears pretty fast. But when I entered my credentials, the mac takes about 10 minutes until it's usable. I can click on windows before, they react after a long time, but I hear the hard drive for ~ 10 minutes and only after that the mac is really usable.\nWhat could be the cause for this? I'm sure this isn't normal as my MacBook Pro is much, much faster (although there's an SSD, not a fusion drive).\nWhat could I do to find the cause? Maybe the Fusion Drive is messed up?\nEDIT:\nI just found that disk0s2 is my rotational disk, disk1s2 is my SSD, I found screenshots of the storage system report which show it exactly the other way round... may that be the problem?\n\nA: I've seen this before, but it could be a number of things. My suspicion is something in your Login Items is using a lot of CPU/Disk/Network thus delaying everything else.\nTo further diagnose run System Preferences from the Apple menu and choose Users & Groups and create another account with any name you like.

How do I increase the cursor size programmatically? I know how to do it manually. Is there a script that can do it from the command line rather than an AppleScript that does it from the GUI.\nWhy?\nI do a lot of customizations to my Mac, but I also create new users all the time. To save time, I would like to programmatically achieve certain customizations.\n\nA: Unfortunately the command line command defaults, which can read and or write the value of the mouseDriverCursorSizekey in thecom.apple.universalaccess .plist file, the write command, e.g. defaults write com.apple.universalaccess mouseDriverCursorSize 2.5 doesn't take immediate affect and may actually get overwritten before the change can take effect. Note: The mouseDriverCursorSize key in com.apple.universalaccess .plist file does not exist unless the default value has previously been changed.\nWhile you said you didn't want to go the GUI route with e.g. AppleScript, how about you split the difference and do it from the command line using osascript to process the AppleScript code, which does make the change from System Preferences, but without being interrupted by the System Preferences UI. As a matter of fact, assuming the System Preferences Dock Tile is still present, as is its default, all you'll see is the System Preferences Dock Tile bounce once, and no System Preferences UI.

The new iTunes (12.7) does not manage apps, this must be done from the device itself, my iPhone in this case.\nCan I delete all the IPA files from my MacBook HD?\n\nA: Yes, you can remove the apps from the Mobile Applications folder in your iTunes library and Transfer Purchases will no longer re-download the apps. However, should the app be removed from your App Store purchased list, the IPA will be the only way to reinstall the app in the future.\nThis may cause some regret since the IPA that iTunes used to download were special versions of the apps that contain all of the app. Most apps on the store these day have been thinned and when you download an app on the iPhone, it it a thin version skipping parts only needed on the iPad for instance. \nIf you don’t keep a backup copy of the full IPA and a copy of iTunes older than 12.7 you will lose the ability to reinstall from the full image. \nThis is not much of a problem if your app of choice neve changes or never gets removed from the online App Store. This also isn’t much of a problem if you upgrade your hardware often. For people interested in running older and not supported hardware and/or abandoned apps or old versions of apps, this can be a substantial problem. \n", "Q: USB wifi dongle with iPhone 4s?

Is there any external wifi adapter available in market for iPhone?\n\nA: This is how you fix this particular problem\n\nA common problem in the iPhone 4S, sometimes the Wi-Fi button will be\n  grayed out and unclickable. This problem seems to be related to\n  thermal shock — the problem may be temporarily fixed by simply putting\n  the phone in the refrigerator for 15 minutes, or under a lamp for 30\n  minutes.\nIf this is the case, then the necessary permanent solution is to\n  reflow the Murata SW SS1830010 Wi-Fi chip on the logic board.\n\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Fix+iPhone+4S+Wi-Fi+Grayed+Out/22167\nMake sure you take it to a professional repair shop.

I wonder if it is a requirement to get an Apple ID or if it is possible to install apps without having an Apple ID? I think that I already have so many IDs and I don't want a new. \n\nA: Yes, you need to use an Apple ID in order to download/buy apps/music/movies/books.\nApple assigns all transaction like downloaded apps (even \"buying\" a free app) to your account so you can download them later. One Apple ID is all you need in order to move freely in Apple's ecosystem.\nWhenever you sign in on a new iPhone with your Apple ID your previous downloads will be available without the need to buy them again. The same is true for purchased music/movies/books/ringtones etc.\nAs noted by @SteveChambers you can use your current email address as your Apple ID.\n", "Q: iCloud lists 3.5GB data used due to Backups, but these are not listed and so can't be deleted Recently I've been getting errors that my iCloud storage is full. I tried deleting backups and data to clear it out. Now, if I go to 'iCloud Storage', I see this, i.e. 3.5GB of my iCloud being taken up by backups.\n\nHowever, when I click on backups, I see this. No backups are listed and according to this page 0 memory is being taken up by backups.\n\nI've gone on all my devices and iCloud for Windows to delete backups and I see the same thing everywhere. Can't figure out a way to delete the phantom backup or completely erase my iCloud data which I'd be willing to do.\nCan anyone help me out? \n\nA: I had the same problem; iCloud storage showed 4.2GB of backups data, but no backups. I tried deleting the 0KB backup too, which seems to do something, but doesn't resolve the issue.\nI contacted Apple Support: started with the chat option, sent screenshots, was escalated to the phone support, because the chat agents don't have enough access I guess. Then was escalated again to a senior support agent. All of them could see no backups in my iCloud account, but I could (and they confirmed) that my iCloud storage was indeed including a backup neither me nor them could find.\nThere is a button that the senior support agent found that can clean up the used (but unused) storage of an iCloud account. Apparently, the chat support should have access to it, but maybe they don't know about it, and they didn't see it. The senior support agent found the button, tried it, and magic, the ghost backup was gone from my iCloud storage, and I was able to do a regular backup again.\n", "Q: Maximise Dock to full width I'm a new user of Macintosh and I'm trying to set the Dock to full width from the center of screen, like with KDE on Linux operating system.\n\nA: You can do this with cDock.\n\nInstall, enable and choose Fullscreen width Dock.\n\n\nA: Another option would be uBar.\n\nYou can read more about it from the website and/or get the trial.\nI'd claim that this works better for people who like to keep nothing but open applications in the dock. That's the way I use it.\nMy favorite features are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Manual sorting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Like for example, all adobe applications are always next to each other no matter which order they are opened it.\n\n\n*App exclusion (hiding)\n\n\n*\n\n*I have some applications that I exclusively show and hide via shortcut toggle, so it's really handy for that. No extra clutter from those apps.\n\n\n*Window preview\n\n*I really like the keyboard shortcuts, likeShift clicking an app will make it quit. cmd+shift clicking will force restart. \n\n\nOne con is I would say that if you like to use spaces, you have to every now and then show the native Dock (cmd+alt+D), to assign a different space to application. Not really a big deal though. Read more about that here: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21872?locale=en_US\n\nuBar 4 is fresh enough that I don't have it yet. I'm not 100% sure if this part below applies to it, but I'm pretty sure it does.\nNot really a downside, but is a bit funny that to get a good experience, you need to hide native Dock and use a bash command to make sure it isn't accidentally shown if you hover over the Dock edge. They mention this in the documentation.\nJust open Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app and paste in the two lines. Make sure the second line executes, you may have to press enter once.\n# Hide Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool true && killall Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 1000 && killall Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool TRUE && killall Dock\n\n# Restore Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool false && killall Dock\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay && killall Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool FALSE && killall Dock\n\nMy own two additiongs to this bash command thing is the first line and second line. \n\n\n*\n\n*First line just enables autohide\n\n*Second line sets a delay, so that the native Dock doesn't show itself if you accidentally hover over the edge, where it is hidden.\n\n*Attention seeking apps will sometimes bounce and start peeking from the bottom, even though autohide is on. So the third line takes care of that.\n\n", "Q: POP change to IMAP I changed from POP to IMAP a few years ago. My difficulty is that I cannot access with my iPad and iPhone the emails/folders on my mac that were established with the POP setting. The IMAP emails are fine between all three.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: That's the way POP and IMAP work. Once POP emails are downloaded and deleted from the server, they are stored locally and can only be accessed on the device that downloaded them. To make them accessible on other devices you have to upload them to IMAP folders.\n", "Q: How many times can I submit my app to iTunes Connect? I recently have been submitting quite a few reviews to Apple, and I wondered if they might get annoyed with the amount of times an app is called for review. I have not approached this limit yet, but I wanted to make sure I do not annoy Apple's reviewers.\nHow many times can I submit my app to iTunes Connect for review? Is there a certain amount of times per month or week?\n\nA: I'm not aware of any documented maximum number of times you can submit an app for review (source: App Store Review Guidelines).\nThe Review team will take the most-recent review request and start their review process, based on my experience over a few years.  When you submit a new version for review, the previous version is no longer eligible for review.\nThe only time you need to be concerned is when the review has already started (you've been notified that it's started) and then you want to do an update.  To avoid this situation, just be sure you really want them to do the review and your app is ready before you tap the 'submit' button.\n", "Q: How do I get the scaling options for \"larger text - more space\" for an external display? The first time I connected my 27-Inch 4k display to my macbook it offered me to virtually scale the resolution of that display, so I could take full advantage of the 4k resolution while having it in 2560x1440 scaling, so similar to the iMac. After re-connecting the mac to the display it's been virtually scaled to 1080p and everything is just huge. When going to the screen options I'm only offered resolutions up to 1920x1080, even when clicking the options key it'll show up until 4k but it'll no longer scale texts and windows to make it look like 2560x1440.\nI basically just want the same options as my macbook screen offers, like I said it worked the first time I connected to the display and I've already tried holding the options key.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue as you on an LG monitor an I think I found a solution to get the Larger Text - More Space option back. \nWhen I got my LG 43ud79-b, everything worked fine. The mac recognized the monitor with 4k res and I was able to go in to my monitor settings and select the more space option.\nAt one point the monitor had a suggestion overlay saying turn on HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color by going to Picture -> Picture Adjust -> HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color to on, which I did. \nAfter that point, the monitor was only recognized as a 1920*1080 monitor and the scaled options only had resolutions instead of the Lager Text - More Space options.\nTurning off the HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color option makes the mac recognize the monitor as a 4k monitor again and brings back the original scaled option. Hope that works for you. \n", "Q: How can I check if Java is installed on my Mac? I have gone into Terminal and typed \njava -v\n\nfor which it responds with \nNo Java runtime present, requesting install.\n\nBut I am not sure if that is confirming if Java is not installed or whether the Java SDK is not installed.\n\nA: If it's responding with No Java runtime present, requesting install.... well, it's not installed. I believe that Apple's default installer still installs Java 6; I'd recommend getting the latest version (right now Java 8u144) from here.\nWith Java 8, java -v fails with Unrecognized option: -v. Use java -version instead.\n\nA: Many versions of Java for macOS install an entry into the System Preferences. If you have a Java icon in System Preferences, it's highly likely that Java is installed on the Mac:\n\n\nA: Check the following path:\n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines\nYou can also use the find command to scan you system.\nIn you terminal execute \nsudo find / -name \"java\" 2>/dev/null\nYou will then find where in your computer there is a java file.\n", "Q: What are the dimensions in pixels of a picture taken with iPhone 8 and X? Does anybody know the dimension, in pixels, of a picture taken with the front and back cameras of both iPhone 8 and iPhone X at their maximum resolutions for both cameras?\n\nA: iPhone X / iPhone 8 Plus / iPhone 8\n\n\n*\n\n*3088 px x 2320 px (FaceTime Camera)\n\n*4032 px x 3024 px (main cameras)\n\n\nSo the cameras have the same resolution on each model. The wide-angle lenses on the back are all stabilized. iPhone 8 Plus features a telephoto camera which is not stabilized. iPhone X has the same telephoto camera but also sports an optical image stabilization.\nSource: Apple.com\n"]
