["Q: How do I enable desktop visual effects? I have lenovo g460 with VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation GT218 [GeForce 310M] (rev a2) grapics card \nI have install the driver using gksudo jockey-gtk command, but when I change the visual effects to extra its give me 'Desktop effects could not be enabled'. I am new to Ubuntu.\n\nA: First go to console (ALT+F2 then type gnome-terminal). Inside the console type nvidia and press the TAB button. If you have the nvidia drivers correctly install there should appear several nvidia files (Like nvidia-settings, nvidia-xconfig, etc..)\nType nvidia-xconfig so it edits the xorg.conf file with the nvidia configs. Reboot the PC.\nIf you can not still have special effects then do the following:\nnvidia-current\n\n\n*\n\n*Install mesa-utils (sudo aptitude install mesa-utils or sudo apt-get install mesa-utils)\n\n*Type glxinfo | grep \"direct rendering\". If a NO appears then there is some problem with your nvidia installs. If a YES appears then typing compiz --replace after pressing ALT+F2 should give you the 3D effects.\n\n*If the NO appeared just try to reinstall the drivers with sudo aptitude reinstall \nnvidia-current\n\n*Lastly type dmesg | grep \"nvidia\" in console to see if there is an output regarding nvidia. Normally the output will say how to fix it.\n\nA: you may want to try my solution:\nadd \"compiz --replace\" to your \"startup applications\" menu.\nI did, and it works.\n\nA: Following instructions given by CYREX, in order to manage easily visual effect, I would suggest to install  Ubuntu Tweak. Than from Ubuntu Tweak check 'Install Simple Desktop Effect Setting Manager'. Run application from System/Preferences/Simple CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\n", "Q: How to fix sound in wolfenstein Enemy Territory I installed wolf:et, and i cant get sound to work.\nEverything that i have installed is in default paths, i had 10.4 and then upgraded to 10.10 via software update gui.\nI had sound working in 10.04 with method under 2.\nI have tried following\n\n\n*\n\n*killall esd; et; esd \nwith that i get  \n\n------- sound initialization -------\n/dev/adsp: No such file or directory\nCould not open /dev/adsp\n------------------------------------\n\n*sudo -i\necho \"et.x86 0 0 direct\" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss\necho \"et.x86 0 0 disable\" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0c/oss\nexit\nwith that i get  \nbash: /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss: No such file or directory\n\nand indeed i do not have that, i have only sub0 and sub1 in pcm0p\n\n*I have tried running et with et-sdl-sound script, but with that i get this output in console\nhttp://pastebin.com/J7gRU1uh\nI have probably messed up sdl libraries, could not get sound to work, so downloaded new from debian package site and installed them.\n\n*Tried setting SDL_AUDIODRIVER=\"pulse\" in et-sdl-sound, looks like i am getting same error as in method 3.\n\n*pasuspender -- et +set s_alsa_pcm plughw:0 \ngives me\n------- sound initialization -------\n/dev/adsp: No such file or directory\nCould not open /dev/adsp\n_------------------------------------\n\nMisc:\n@Oli: i do not know if i am running pulse or esd, how can i check that?\n\nA: I got tired of rebooting to windows just to play wolf-et, so i tried doing clean install of ubuntu 10.10 (maverick).\nAnd after that I just installed Wolfenstein: ET from playdeb and everything works great.\nhttp://www.playdeb.net/software/Enemy%20Territory\n\nA: Not sure why you're running esd.

We chase each individual setting that Unity uses, and reset them to their default values, and then reload unity to apply changes. Ah yes, we also kill Unity and compiz before we start, since it is known to get tricky if we change settings under compiz's nose.\n\nWhy is this better compared to using dconf-editor or dconf reset ?\n\n\n*\n\n*Didier Roche (didrocks), the author of unity python wrapper says dconf reset does not work in all cases.\n\n*The consensus among Unity developers is that the settings be modified using Gsettings instead of dconf directly.\n\n\n\nWhat exactly is dconf ?\nA little history\n\n\n*\n\n*The configuration settings were managed by gconf earlier.\n\n*Gnome provides Gsettings as a replacement for gconf.\n\n*Gsettings is a high level api that manipulates the settings stored in a backend.\n\n*Unity stores its settings in the backend dconf since it can be loaded much faster than gconf.\n\n\nA: For 11.10 and later\nFrom http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Unity/FAQ\ncd ~; rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity .compiz-1 .config/compiz-1 .config/dconf\n\n\nA: I ran across this thread after my Unity 2d desktop suddenly refused to display launchpad and title bar (for all users), for no apparent reason. Autohide was disabled. Reenabling Unity in CCSM as sugggested in other threads was part of the solution, but none of the other measures suggested in this and several other related threads, including, but not limited to:\nReinstalling unity\n\nReinstalling ubuntu desktop\n\nRemoving all relevant (e.g. compiz, gconf, etc.) configuration information\n\nhelped me to completely resolve these symptoms.\nunity --reset\n\nwould not work for me. After delivering a variety of error and information messages, it would always hang at:\nSetting Update \"run_key\"\n\nas shown in the log posted in the thread titled \"unity has vanished\" for unity run with no arguments.\nI noticed that the error message delivered by:\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nwas similar to some of the errors reported by unity --reset:\nerror while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: \ncannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.\n\nAfter extensive searching, I found the following solution (courtesy of J.D. Bartlett):\nGet the path of libGL.so.1 by using the command locate libGL.so.1.\n\nAdd a link to the library in /usr/lib/ as shown in the following example:\n\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib\n\nRestart the computer.\n\nThis not only allowed both unity_support_test-p and unity --reset to run, it also allowed Unity 2d to start. Like the author of the above-mentioned post, I have no idea what caused my problems. I am also still not sure whether the link is a complete solution, or whether I should reinstall the graphics libraries completely, but since creating the link, everything has worked fine for a few weeks now.\n\nA: Myself, I'd simply try \nrm -rf ~/.compiz-1\n", "Q: What do these apt commands do?

It has done nothing since 2011 at the very latest. It did nothing in the version of Ubuntu that was current when this question was posted. If you look it up in the apt.conf man page, it is not there. If you look for it in the apt source code, it is not there. It's not quite using a regular expression to parse HTML, but it most definitely will not solve your problem and should never be used by anyone.\nFor one brief, shining moment, between 10:59 PM UTC on Friday, April 1st, 2005, when it sprang fully formed from the head of Michael Vogt, and 8:38 PM UTC on Monday, February 20th, 2006, when he reluctantly had to put it down, setting Acquire::BrokenProxy would force APT to always re-download the signature file for a package repository, instead of just asking to be sent it if it had been modified. Presumably this is because some \"broken\" proxies were just sending the old version of the file even when it has changed.\nThis is all it has ever done, as far as I can tell. You can git clone https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt.git and git log -S \"BrokenProxy\" in there to find commits that add and remove this string to/from the APT source code; I only count the two.\nThis feature first came out in APT version 0.6.35ubuntu1 and would have last been available around APT version 0.6.43.3, going by the state of the changelog file at those commits. Digging through the Packages.gz files on http://old-releases.ubuntu.com, it looks like it should have had an effect on Ubuntu 5.04 (Hoary Hedgehog), Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger), and Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake) (which has 0.6.40.1ubuntu9). Version 6.06 was an LTS release that went out of support in 2011. After 2011, or on any Ubuntu that is 6.10 (Edgy Eft), with apt 0.6.45ubuntu14, or later, nobody has had any business whatsoever using this option.\nHowever, Acquire::BrokenProxy remains a popular apt.conf option to this day. It got its humble start in December 2005, when its author suggested it as a troubleshooting approach in an Ubuntu bug report about BADSIG errors. Over the next few years, many lost souls found their way to this bug report, and a few tried passing -o Acquire::BrokenProxy=true to their package managers, following an encouraging 2006 report by a user that it had worked for them. Despite a couple of subsequent reports that the option did not (and, depending on Ubuntu version, most likely could no longer) help, in 2009-2010 the option made the rounds on blogs and forums, and by 2012 it had been posted back on the BADSIG bug as part of \"the fix\" for a misbehaving proxy.\nIn 2013, two major technologies arrived on the scene that changed computing forever: the Docker container management system, and the 99fixbadproxy APT config file:\nAcquire::http::Pipeline-Depth \"0\";\nAcquire::http::No-Cache=True;\nAcquire::BrokenProxy=true;\n\nSoon, people began combining the power of these two technologies, presumably because Docker image building is an apt stress test and the other two options actually do something useful. Today, the 99fixbadproxy file, with this option that has never had any effect in any Ubuntu version that has ever been available as a Docker image, can be found in Dockerfiles all over Github. It has even ascended to become part of Github itself: if you use Github Actions to run tasks on Ubuntu, your Ubuntu machine will be configured with Acquire::BrokenProxy by a 99fixbadproxy-descendant.\nTruly, it is impossible to underestimate the power of the Acquire::BrokenProxy option. It's completely inert, it comes attached to other code that may or may not help resolve an intermittent failure, and it looks plausible enough that hardly anyone, present company excepted, has ever thought to question its presence.\n", "Q: Can some one suggest a software to monitor and maintain record of total internet bandwidth usage Can some one suggest a software for a small home network to monitor the amount uploaded / download from the internet but not the local traffic on the LAN.

Wikipedia:\n\nDarik's Boot and Nuke (commonly known\n  as DBAN) [...] is designed to securely\n  erase a hard disk until data is\n  permanently removed and no longer\n  recoverable, which is achieved by\n  overwriting the data with random\n  numbers generated by Mersenne twister\n  or ISAAC (a PRNG). The Gutmann method,\n  Quick Erase, DoD Short (3 passes), and\n  DOD 5220.22-M (7 passes) are also\n  included as options to handle Data\n  remanence.\nDBAN can be booted from a floppy disk,\n  CD, DVD, or USB flash drive and it is\n  based on Linux. It supports PATA\n  (IDE), SCSI and SATA hard drives. DBAN\n  can be configured to automatically\n  wipe every hard disk that it sees on a\n  system, making it very useful for\n  unattended data destruction scenarios.\n  DBAN exists for Intel x86 and PowerPC\n  systems.\nDBAN, like other methods of data\n  erasure, is suitable for use prior to\n  computer recycling for personal or\n  commercial situations, such as\n  donating or selling a computer[2]. In\n  the case of malware infection, DBAN\n  can be used before returning a disk to\n  production.\n\n\nA: One more advantage of shred over dd in this scenario:\nI have a faulty disk that I need to return to the vendor for an exchange.\ndd halts at the first bad block, and fails to clobber the rest (unless I painfully use skip=... to jump ahead each time it stops).\nshred ignores write errors and happily continues in this case.\n\nA: I generally use a destructive read-write test using badblocks -w. The two major advantages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's part of the base system and almost every rescue system, so it is available e.g. from the rescue shell of the Ubuntu installer\n\n*you get a report at the end whether there are bad blocks on the disk\n\n\nNote that if the report indicates a problem, I'd no longer sell the disk as it is likely to fail soon.\nAlso Note: The -w does a 4-pass destructive write test by default.\n\nUse write-mode test. With this option, badblocks scans for bad blocks by writing some patterns (0xaa, 0x55, 0xff, 0x00) on every block of the device, reading every block and comparing the contents.\n\nUsage example (if your disk is sdd):\nsudo badblocks -wsv /dev/sdd\n\n(added sv for progress bar + verbose)\nFor a much faster wipe, add the -t option and do a single pass of zeros like so:\nsudo badblocks -wsv -t 0x00 /dev/sdd\n\n\nA: Securely erasing a storage device\nThere's a command-line utility called shred, which overwrites data in a file or a whole device with random bits, making it nearly impossible to recover.\nFirst of all, you need to identify the name of the device.\nThis might be something like /dev/sdb or /dev/hdb (but not like /dev/sdb1, that's a partition). You can use sudo fdisk -l to list all connected storage devices, and find your external hard drive there.\nN.B. Make sure it is the correct device, picking the wrong device will wipe it.\nUnmount all currently mounted partitions on that device, if any.\nThen run the following, replacing /dev/sdX with the name of your device:\nsudo shred -v /dev/sdX\n\nThis will overwrite all the blocks on the device with random data three times, the -v flag is for verbose and will print the current progress. \nYou can add the option -nN to only do this N times, to save time on large capacity devices. This might take a while, depending on the size of your external hard drive (I think it takes twenty minutes or so for my 4 GB flash drive).\nYou can also set all bits to zero after the last iteration by adding the option -z, I prefer to do this.\nsudo shred -v -n1 -z /dev/sdX\n\nAfter this, you would have to repartition the device. The easiest way is to install GParted and use it:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\ngksu gparted\n\nChoose your device in the upper-right corner list. Then select Device -> Create partition table to create a partition table on the device.\nThen add a single partition that uses all of the unallocated space on the device, choosing fat32 as the file system. Apply the changes by click the Apply button (the green checkmark) in the toolbar.\nTips\n\n\n*\n\n*Read the manpage for shred online or by typing man shred in the terminal.\n\n*Beware that some parts of your disk will not be erased - use the drive firmware \"SECURE ERASE\" command, such as via hdparm, to properly clean off a disk.\n\n\nA: Have a look at this definitive question on Security Stack Exchange \nHow can I reliably erase all information on a hard drive\nThis discusses various secure deletion options, along with physical destruction and wiping so you can decide which option may be your best bet.\nRemember though that the current recovery status for different storage is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Very old hard drives: there were gaps between tracks so you could potentially pick up bleed into these gaps (if you had a scanning electron microscope handy). Overwriting multiple times was potentially useful.\n\n*New hard drives: no technology currently exists that can read after even one overwrite.\n\n*Solid state hard drives: wear levelling means you cannot overwrite securely. Instead you either encrypt the entire volume and dispose of the key to wipe, or you destroy the device.\n\n\nA: Now, Disks (gnome-disks) tool has ATA Secure Erase. You may use it to erase your hard drive. Same option explained in this answer using the command-line tool hdparm.\n\nWARNING!\n\nPlease, review disclaimer and warning notes at https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase (Thanks to @colan to bring this up)\nAlso comments below. Some hardware may break.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disks tool → Choose the target disk\n\n*From menu: Format Disk...\n\n*Select from drop box, Erase: ATA Enhanced Secure Erase ( if offered for the drive you selected ). Alternatively you can select Write zeros (slow) which can reasonably be considered to be secure.\n\n*Format\n\n\n\n\nA: Best is to use the secure erase function of ATA drives. Secure erase erases the drive at firmware level. Can't get more secure.\nFirst check if secure erase is supported:\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX | grep -i security\n\n(replace sdX with sda/sdb/sdc, whatever your disk is).\nIf you see no output, just use dd:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M\n\nIf you see output, check if the device is not frozen:\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX | grep -i frozen\n\nIf it is frozen, see How to unfreeze drive in Linux?\nOtherwise if you see not frozen, set password to \"Eins\":\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass Eins /dev/sdX\n\nOptional: you might want to know how how long this will take:\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX | awk '/for SECURITY ERASE UNIT/'\n\nThen execute the erase:\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-erase Eins /dev/sdX\n\nThen wait. Apparently for a 1TB disk this might take 3 hours or more.\nThere's a nice script which automated these steps.\n\nA: Just 'zero' it using the dd tool:\n\n*\n\n*Start the Disk Utility via System > Administration > Disk Utility\n\n*Find your disk in the left panel, select it, and on the right find the device path (eg. /dev/sdX )\n\n*Run the following command from a terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal):sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1MMake sure you use the right device path and not just copy this line!\n\nThis will overwrite the whole disk with zeros and is considerably faster than generating gigabytes of random data. Like all the other tools this won't take care of blocks that were mapped out for whatever reason (write errors, reserved, etc.), but it's highly unlikely your buyer will have the tools and the knowledge to recover anything from those blocks.\nPS: Before you Bruce Schneier fanboys downvote me: I want proof that it's possible to recover data from a non-ancient rotational hard drive that has been overwritten with zeros. Don't even think about commenting otherwise! :P\n\nA: Use lsblk to get the disk name.\nCAUTION: Don't zero-fill an SSD, ever. Find more details here.\nIn case of HDD, you can use the following commands.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=4096 count=2013054 status=progress\n\nor,\nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX bs=4096 count=2013054 status=progress\n\nor,\nsudo dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sdX bs=4096 count=2013054 status=progress\n\nReplace X with appropriate letter.\nPlease note that you need to use count= otherwise you will get dd: error writing '/dev/sdX': No space left on device\nTo calculate count=, you can use the following command.\necho $(($(df --output=size -B1 /dev/sda | tail -1)/4096))\n\nPlease replace 4096 with your bs= value.\nFor NVMe or SATA SSD, read on. From now on the following CAUTION will be applicable.\nCAUTION: Do not proceed with this if the target drive is not connected directly to a SATA/NVMe interface. Issuing the Secure Erase/Format/Sanitize command on a drive connected via USB or a SAS/RAID card could potentially brick the drive!\nFor SATA SSD drive check SATA SSD.\nFor NVMe drive check NVMe Drive.\n\nA: Go root and\ndd if=/dev/random of=/dev/(your usb drive device here); dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/(your usb drive device here)\n\nBe certain you've got the right drive!\n\nA: DBAN is an open source Boot CD to wipe the hard disk.\nDown load from\nhttp://www.dban.org/download\nburn it and boot the machine from CD, that's all.\n\nA: Easiest way to do that is use :\nsudo shred -fv /dev/xxx\n\nwhere xxx is device, to ensure what device you have, type :\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThe device are indicated after disk word and to the colon char :, like this :\nDisk /dev/sde: 500.1 GB etc...\n\nDon't mount file systems of your disk you want wipe etc.\nShred will do what you want in part of time. -z option is for last run with 0 to hide wipe and is not necessary to wipe data.\nBest way is to use dd like wrote previous users:\nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/xxx bs=1M\n\nuse urandom device as it is more modern and better way to obtain random pattern.\nOther tools at this moment can be older and by less people develop. Shred is in core application of Linux.\nLook at this example: wipe 2009 http://lambda-diode.com/software/wipe/. But it is known app.\nIt is possible to use bleachbit but as I tried it took long time.\n\nA: If the dd cmd is not working, you can use the redirection method to wipe out the data.\nLike,\ncat /dev/urandom > /dev/sd**a**   # depends on your hdd location \n\nor \nalternatively you can use cp (copy cmd) to overwrite the previous data.\ncp /dev/urandom /dev/sd**a**      # depends on your hdd location \n\n\nA: Use nwipe, it's command line or ncurses GUI. Has multiple wipe methods. Can wipe many devices simultaneously. It's the more up to date version of DBAN and is currently maintained. Nwipe can be found in most Linux distros and is available as a bootable USB version called Shredos\nNwipe https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe\nShredos https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.2020.02\n\nA: You can use pv to zero-fill it and you'll even get a nice progress bar:\npv < /dev/zero > /dev/sdX\n\nwhere sdX is the device of the drive to delete; you can get that from this command:\nlsblk\n\nTaken from pv(1)\nYou can also one-fill it with pv:\ntr '\\0' '\\377' < /dev/zero | pv > /dev/sdX\n\nPartially taken from monkeybus's answer\n\nA: Those recommending to use shred are giving bad advice. Shred's own man page says it's effectively useless on journaled filesystems, which Ubuntu is almost guaranteed to be using if you don't change its filesystem defaults (ext3 and ext4 are journaled. As is resierfs and Reiser4 as well as many MANY other common Linux filesystems.).\nNot to mention shred is completely useless for completely blanking or randomizing a disk, as it only works on individual files or sets of files (On the filesystem level, not a raw data level.). If you want to securely wipe a disk, you gotta use dd on the drive's main device node (For example: /dev/sdc instead of /dev/sdc1) while nothing is mounted on it.\nIt WILL take a while, but unlike shred it will completely and IRREVERSIBLY wipe a hard disk from MBR to final sector. Also, BIG WARNING on dd, make sure you are using it on the correct device or you'll at least PARTIALLY wipe the wrong disk. This could be disastrous if you accidentally use dd on a system drive, which will not only make it unbootable, but may irreversibly corrupt any given partition on the drive. This has given it the nickname \"disk destroyer.\"\nShred is NOT a reliable tool for securely wiping a drive. If you're selling or giving your computer away the CORRECT way to empty the drive is to zero or randomize it with dd and never, ever use shred, as filesystem journals will effectively restore shredded files with no effort at all.\n", "Q: Create encrypted (password protected) zip file How do I create an encrypted (password protected) zip file?\n\nA: Starting from Ubuntu 17.10, right-clicking and selecting \"Compress\" no longer has \"Other Options\" listed.\nTo resolve this, open \"Archive Manager\"  and then drag & drop the files/folders from your File Manager into it and it will appear.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install zip\nzip -r --encrypt result.zip folder\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Install zip\n\n*Use -r to zip directory and subdirectory\n\n*Use --encrypt to secure your files \n\nwith a simple password-based symmetric encryption system, which is documented in the ZIP specification \n\nWikipedia\n\nA: You can also right-click on a folder or file(s) in Nautilus and select \"Compress...\".

Unless you're interested in getting more involved with Ubuntu development, simply file a bug against the package in question (you might also want to tag it \"bite-sized\" so new contributers can find it).

On Windows and Mac, they use the AcrossLite program from LitSoft, but their Linux version hasn't been maintained, and I don't even know if it's still available. I know there's XWord, but it doesn't support all the newer features of AcrossLite, like allowing more than one letter per square (a frequent trick in the Sunday puzzles).\nI've tried the Windows version of AcrossLite under wine, but it's surprisingly bad.\nEDIT (02/11/2011) I contacted LitSoft directly to see if they were ever planning on making the Linux version available again. I received a response right away from a developer. I'm quoting directly from the email:\n\nYes, Across Lite for Linux will be available again sometime in 1Q2011. We are currently working on a v1.2 re-compile for newer Unix distros as a first-step and will later evolve it to 2.0 version.

The smaller the size the better.\nAny Suggestion\nRegards  \n\nA: You could try starting with just the Ubuntu minimal image, found here.  Building up from the 10Mb ISO should give you enough flexibility to keep the size down as much as possible.\nJeos (Just Enough OS) has been discontinued now - it's only available with the old 8.04 version.  This document, highlighted by Marcello Nuccio in the comments below, demonstrates that Jeos itself is now replaced by a combination of using vmbuilder and the minimal install.

It uses vmbuilder, a python script that enables you to generate your JEOS in cli.\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide drag handles in non-expanded gnome panel? I've just started using DockBarX in place of AWN, and I'm liking the simplicity of it. The one thing I've found that irritates me is the visible drag handles in the panel. (My awn setup had no panels.) Is there any setting that will hide them? \nHere's what I'm talking about; outlined in red:\n\n\nA: No, at least not with the standard gnome-panel. \nThere is a bug report with a patch for this: #412975.\nIt doesn't look like an option to hide the drag handles will ever be added to the standard gnome-panel though.\n", "Q: When is it appropriate to use `dump` vs `rsync`? When is it appropriate to use dump vs rsync for backups?\n\nA: Having expended far too much time with dump, it is probably best relegated to history. Its primary design goal was to be as efficient as possible with slow filesystems and the constraints of magnetic tape. \nThose design criteria no longer obtain and I cannot imagine a situation (aside from legacy systems) where dump would provide any advantage.\n\nA: dump is traditionally used in cases where you need to image an entire device once, and not keep backing it up incrementally. Since it was created in a time where magnetic tapes were popular, random disk writes were not all that possible, making incremental backups nearly impossible.\nrsync is a more robust tool that doesn't try to account for those obsolete technologies. This allows it to have random access to the backup destination and lets it take true incremental backups.\ndump functions at a lower level than rsync, so you can actually ask it to dump unmounted filesystems, which AFAIK isn't a possibility with rsync. Other than that, rsync is a superior tool in almost every way, and allows you to minimize transfer, which is especially useful over network backups.\n\nA: In addition to the other answers, rsync's ability to run on most operating systems (even telephones!) and it's sheer ubiquity and popularity make it my choice.\n\nA: Strictly speaking, rsync is not a backup tool -- it is a copy tool.  If you want to use a simple copy as a backup method, then rsync is a good tool to accomplish that.  dump gets you an archive file that can be compressed, so it takes up less space than a simple copy, and can be split across multiple backup disks and put on write once media.  It also can do incremental backups both for speed of daily backups, and so you have multiple snapshots in time you can go back through looking for a specific version of a file.  You can get something similar with rsnapshot which uses rsync and hard links, but it requires the backup medium to be a single hard disk that is large enough.\n", "Q: User guide for users migrating from Windows?

LibreOffice is installed by default in 11.04, before that it was OpenOffice.org.\n\nA: I'do go for    inkscape \nIt's vector-based and i've used it quite a few times. I think it's a very good option.  \nIt's help is also very good, as it has many tutorials in order to learn how to use it (you can access them through: Help > Tutorials)\n\nA: Well that really depends on your preference; If you like to use vector software such as inkscape which will allow to design like if you were to be using Adobe illustrator. Then the other route would be to use a raster based software such as the GIMP which allows you to design like if you were to be using Adobe Photoshop.\nVector =  Lines and Curves\nScales better if you want to later on resize your image but only works well when creating original works without any photos.\nRaster = Dots per inch or DPI\nMostly used for modifying photos or creating digital art work with photos. This works great if your artwork will make use of heavy photo editing/manipulation.\nNote: In inkscape you can import raster images and add some effects and export your designs as raster images with the .png file extension. inkscape can also export or save your designs as a PDF file.\n\nA: Dia allows working with pages or the whole poster.

I use gnome-do as a launcher and I use exposé to check what windows I have open. The only thing in there that I need a panel for is Network Manager/Notifications.

It's quite light and it's used often with minimalist WMs.\nI have used it in the past and it did its work.\n\nA: You should be able to see your network notifications through libnotify messages.The only thing I think you'll miss is your network status, which you can check via command line if required. You may want to ensure that Alt-F2 works for 'run', or that you have some other method of re-launching Gnome-Do if it crashes (which it does occasionally). In the worst case, there's always ctrl-alt-F1 to switch to a console. \n\nA: Try Wicd, you can manage network without a panel. For the sound, you can manage it with keyboard for a lots of laptops.

Is it possible to setup a shortcut for enable/disable wifi?\n\nA: I've been looking for a solution to this for myself for a while, and have used a lot of tips and tricks for all over. I've finally found the solution that works for me, and decided to create a newbie walk-through. Bear with me, this is also for those less able to program in linux than many of you, like myself;\nClick the launcher icon on the top left slide out bar (Dash Home), type in 'gedit', and click enter.\nYou're now going to create the script that will toggle the wifi;\nI used the network manager shortcut; nmcli nm wifi, to determine the wifi state, and also to control it.

This is because the Debian package is designed to have a single tomcat installation be able to serve multiple running tomcat instances, and because the packaging requirements are much more strict for Debian/Ubuntu and actually insist that configuration is in /etc, variable data is in /var, and so on.  RedHat has no such requirements, and the JBoss distribution rather lumps it all together in a way that is difficult to parcel out.\n\n*Perfectionism in the face of poor/nonexistent documentation.  If you look at the Debian/Ubuntu packages for libjboss-*, you'll see that all the libraries are separate packages.  This is because they're not actually a single product, but a collection of them, that just happen to work together.  In the standard JBoss tarball, you have \"default\" and \"all\" (and \"minimal\", I think...) that are a few \"example\" combinations...but many combinations are actually possible.  I'm certain the packager knows this, and is trying to make a way to only install those libraries you need in the system JBoss installation, as is good practice (but hardly ever followed, in the case of JBoss, where nearly everyone just uses the \"all\" example).\n\n*Difficulty of integration.  There are no service start scripts that are anywhere near the level of sophistication that is normal in Ubuntu.  The server process itself just spits to stdout, even.  You'd need to find ways of redirecting to log files, in a rotate-able manner, set up the cron/logwatch to deal with it, write the init script, etc.  This is not trivial, especially considering that JBoss is a collection of \"whatever\" libraries the user decides to use, and is not designed with system installations in mind -- it's clearly a \"run this out of your home directory\" type of setup, out of the box.\n\n*Lack of need.  The tarball, placed in /opt, perhaps with checkinstall, does the job for anyone who actually does large-scale deployments.  If you're doing large-scale deployments, you typically have your own package repository anyway, so one more isn't much of an issue.  There just isn't enough need to make a good package for it.\nThat said, I've been working on making on such a package.  I've been \"working on it\" for two years, though I actually need it now.  Hopefully, there will be a PPA for it soon.  :-)  If you have done .deb packaging before, and know JBoss internals, perhaps we can collaborate.\n\nA: Jboss is available in the software center.\n\nBut the version is still 4.2.3.GA-2\n", "Q: How do I turn my source code into an Ubuntu package and how do I get it in the repositories? I have written a program in C and I wish to create an Ubuntu .deb package. How do I do this? How do I get it included in the Ubuntu official repositories?\n\nA: This is the best place to start NewPackages it gives you the low down on building and submitting your package. However its not going to happen over night so a short term alternative and something you would need to do at some point any way is set up a launchpad ppa suggested by aking1012 that way you can inform people who would like to use it how to add your ppa and get update of your program and they will be able to give you bug info.   \n\nA: Debian maintainers guide covers making debs: http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/ \ngetting it included in the repos...think there is a registration/review procedure...anyway, it wouldn't get it into official repos, but launchpad is a start.  \nlaunchpad is discussed here: https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA\n\nA: There are some good packaging answers here: \nWhat is the simplest Debian Packaging Guide?\n", "Q: Install disk isn't finishing So I have tried installing ubuntu 10.10 on an empty hard drive and I will get all the way to the slide show and after some time it goes to a screen with vertical lines on it kinda like it is stalling out and nothing happens after words.  \nI was successful in getting all the way to the menu that say's it must restart and went to restart it and it said there was no disk I even went to the boot menu and selected the appropriate drive to boot from thinking maybe it had something to do with that.  \nAny suggestions on how to solve this problem would be appreciated   \n\nA: If you removed the disc before choosing the restart option, then you might not be able to restart from the desktop, in which case you have to manually turn off and turn on your computer and it should boot fine if your BIOS is set right.\nIf you chose to restart while the disc is still in the drive, then either the disc will eject automatically or you will be prompted to eject it manually, after which it will restart.\nThe stalling out you mentioned may not be a problem since you already got to the restart screen. However, if that is the issue, it is possible that your disc is dirty, or that your drive can only read CD/DVD of a certain specification but you used one with another specification.\n", "Q: Copy-and-paste is often corrupted I have ubuntu 10.10 with the 64-bit desktop version.

I tried to log in with my user and the new user from a workers machine and I couldn't get in from there either but I just got an \"access denied\" dialog everytime on his machine.\nIs there possibly another step I am missing?\n\nA: The easiest way (in my opinion) to share files across a local network with Windows machines is to use a program I've written called NitroShare. All you need to do is install the application on each of the machines. Then you can simply drag-and-drop files.\nInstalling on Ubuntu\nSimply open a terminal and run the following commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:george-edison55/nitroshare\nsudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install nitroshare\n\nInstalling on Windows\nSimply download and run the installer below:\nhttps://launchpad.net/nitroshare/0.2/0.2/+download/nitroshare_0.2_win32.exe\nTransferring files\nOnce you have the application installed on each machine, you should see a small box on each desktop:\n\n\n\nSimply drag a file on to the box to send it to another machine. That's it.\n\nA: The username and password it asks for should be your username and password on the local machine.  It's as simple as that.\nFor instance, if your username in Ubuntu is john and your password is iloveubuntu, then you should enter those two to access your files from any computer.\nIf you want others to be able to access a shared directory, just create a user for them on the local machine, and they should be able to access it using their own username and password too. You probably need to set the Allow others to create and delete files in this folder to let them edit the files, but this is not necessary for just sharing your files with them.\n", "Q: Will my current Gnome desktop be preserved when upgrading to 11.04 I was wondering since Ubuntu 11.04 will include Unity as the default interface, if (when the time comes) I upgrade to 11.04 from 10.10 will my current desktop setup be preserved somewhere, so in case I do not like Unity I can simply switch back to my Gnome desktop\n\nA: Switching between Unity and your (preserved) GNOME session will be as simple as logging out, choosing \"Ubuntu Classic Desktop\" at the login screen, and logging in again.\n\n\n\nA: Note that session saving is not present in 11.04: see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-session/+bug/726431 .

I have a production Ubuntu server in a remote location, which recently started to behave strangely. \nI suspect RAM errors, and want to have a physical RAM check without rebooting, Live CDs or memtests which causes downtime.\nI know that on-line RAM test is a contradiction in terms (because a full physical check requires that no process will be running), but I wonder if there is any way to make a random physical check which might give some indication of RAM failure.\nThanks,\nAdam\n\nA: Sounds like your concerned with uptime.

I've been planning to change my OS to Ubuntu,\nbut my hard disk contains 750GB of files (in two NTFS partitions: 250GB and 700GB).\nI know that it is possible to keep the larger partition and install Ubuntu to the remaining space, but I would like to know if it is efficient to read an NTFS partition from within Ubuntu, and whether there are better ways.\n\nA: \nit is efficient to read an NTFS partition from within Ubuntu\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, it more than efficient enough to read your data. It will work relatively well. However, note that NTFS doesn't support all the advanced permissions and journaling that Linux filesystems do, and that Linux requires to work nicely. This means that if you use the partition for anything other than simple data, you may run into issues. Note also that the NTFS implementation is rather new, and not as rock solid as the one for FAT or even HFS. \n\n\n\nwhether there are better ways\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You could back up the data to another drive and start from a clean slate. The Ubuntu installer will give you one big partition for all your stuff, and this is the way things work most nicely in Linux.\n\n\nBut as I said, mounting and using the big partition will work perfectly. If you choose not to create a real Linux file system.\nYou can't convert them easily and safely. If you want to change a file system, you should back up the data anyway. And if you do, creating a new partition and restoring the data to it makes a lot more sense. I'm relatively sure there isn't a stable implementation of NTFS to ext4 conversion. File systems are awesomely complicated. :-)\nIf you have only the one hard drive, and no possibility of backing it all up, I'd recommend to touch it as little as possible. Don't shrink partitions, let alone try to convert file system. Install Ubuntu on the 250GB partition, \nyou'll be very happy.\n\nA: Ubuntu will automatically recognize and allow you to access the remaining Windows' partition.  I use a dual-boot setup with Ubuntu as my primary operating system, and occasionally booting into Windows.

(only do it when you are \"comfortable\" with the idea, and really know how to do it.   \nI've been using Ubuntu for 3 months now, and the NTFS system works fine, but it does have those \"permissoins\" issues and its not as robust when there's a powe-out... so I'm converting to Ext4 (I'm actaully in the middle of doing it today :) ...   by the way, it is a DATA only drive..

(maybe there is a GUI tool for that, but I prefer to \"get under the hood\") ..so hold off doing it until you are confident about mouting devices permanently..  \nI've got it working now, and its a great learning experience (about mounts)... but! be sure you can do it before you try it out...  \nI also partiion the drive (1 TB) to allow 100 GB as an NTFS partition for \"Windows only\" stuff (a reminder of the bad-old days :).  I've got 2 backup 1TB drives, and I would recommend that you HAVE A FULL AND COMPLETE BACKUP before you start!   \nSo take your time.. don't rush into it.. and one day, down the track,  you'll \"just do it!\" :)\n\nA: Reading and writing to a NTFS partition can be a problem, or so i believe, but to my limited knowledge it is best if you can somehow migrate data to ext* or something similar.\n\nA: From my personal experience. I had a dedicated Windows directory (about 50 Gb) contaning my files (documents, photos) located in d:\\MyDocs. In order to preserve a directories' structure and not to be confused with new location in Ubuntu, I just copied from Ubuntu (by mean of Midnight Commander) whole directory to the same directory in my Ubuntu Home catalog. (Of course I used a traditional way for accessing NTFS volumes from Ubuntu :).\nBest wishes,\nVincenzo   \n", "Q: How to install (or mock) Internet Explorer? I need to install a Windows application, which checks if there is Internet Explorer of at least 5th version installed and refuses to install (while I believe it does not really need it to work) if it is not.\nI've tried winetricks to install ie 8, 7, 6 full, 6 versions it offers - none worked - versions 7 and 8 installers report a function missing in msvcr (installing all msvcr versions didn't help), ie6 report some other error (I'll specify if it matters).\nI've also tried IEs4Linux - it also fails, complaining for a \"BadIDChoice\" X Window System error received by ies4linux-gtk.py.\nIs there a way to install any IE version in Ubuntu 10.10 with Wine or to mock its presence? I don't even need it to work, just to be installed in the Wine system so that other Windows programs could see it's there.\nI use Ubuntu 10.10 with Wine 1.3.8.\n\nA: If you want to fake having it installed, try : winetricks\n\nIf this isn't working, I can't help you much, except to suggest installing with playonlinux and then replacing your wine prefix with the ie's prefix, but that would mean you have to reinstall everything.\n\nA: Ivan, in the Wine HQ AppDB (http://appdb.winehq.org), there are entries for several versions of Internet Explorer. Have you tried them all with no success? Pay attention to the versions, it's not unusual that a newer Wine version breaks apps that worked in a previous one.\nHowever, as I have never had the need for using IE under Wine (and never tried it), for the sake of easeness, I would expressly recommend you use PlayOnLinux you can \n\napt-get install playonlinux\n\nSo far, I had zero problems when installing games & apps through scripts in their repositories. There are many possibilities here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use it directly to install IE 6 or 7\n\n*Use their\nsite to check what their scripts do,\nso you can do it yourself instead\n(check\nhttp://www.playonlinux.com/repository/?cat=4\nand then click over IE 6 & 7 entries)\n\n*You can just use it to\nmanage a \"Wine environment\" and configure different Wine prefixes/versions for\neach app - even if\nthere's no script available from them,\nbut you manage to configure/run the\napplication by yourself\n\n\nA: The answers are in this blog post of mine.  Since you already have the Wine PPA with the beta wines, you should already have winetricks.  Literally all you need to do at this point is:\n\nwinetricks ie6\n\n(or winetricks ie7, or winetricks ie8).  Note that I'm not certain if ie8 actually works at this point, but it at least installs.\nIf you want fake IE, this is now a built in feature of Wine, provided you have Wine's gecko installed.  Wine-gecko is in a separate package, but it should have been installed automatically when you installed Wine.\n\nA: If you use firefox, you can use this extension to mock the browser agent.\nI know its kinda not related, since you need to check for existence, but the next step might be using the IE, and it might be helpful for that.\n", "Q: Can I install Unity on 10.04? I don't have any problem with GNOME, it's actualy great, but wanna testing same thing new, how?\n\nA: Backporting all the required parts was too much work for 10.10, so an option for 10.04 is highly unlikely.\nHowever you can install an 11.04 image onto a USB stick, which would give you an option of trying it at your convenience without breaking your 10.04:\nHow do I install Ubuntu to a USB key?

A notifier for all the three if it's possible beside the clock...\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.04 with Gnome 2.30.2. Thank you.\n\nA: Try Pidgin with the webMail Notifier plugin, If Pidgin is too much for just mail notification, then try if mail-notification available in the repositories will work, for mail-notification to work with some Yahoo e-mail accounts you may have to pay for the Yahoo pop3 service.\nIf you do not yet have a Yahoo account or would like to create another one here is a little tip; When signing up with Yahoo you can select a country that Yahoo allows free pop services as described here; http://www.techiecorner.com/126/free-yahoo-pop3-email-account-yahoo-mail-sg-and-hk/, I tried this and the account created does allow pop3 service to be enabled.\nLastly, even though you did not ask for this, try this addon for Firefox available here; https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4490/ you may like it.\n\nA: for Ubuntu 12.04\nYou may also like Popper.\nUnfortunately the development of Popper was discontinued. Therefore the last version published was for 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: If you search for \"gmail\" in Synaptic you'll see a number of packages for gmail notifiers. Also Prism IIRC can notify from the panel. I've used checkgmail in the past and liked it, but not enough to reinstall it.\n\nA: You may also want to look into CloudSn.  It's a notifier that runs through your Indicator Applet (or the tray) and connects to gmail, twitter, identi.ca and POP email accounts.\n\nA: There is a package in the repositories called mail-notification.  I have only tested it with Hotmail (Outlook.com) and under MATE.  I won't say that it works perfectly, but here are some tips for getting connected:\n\n\n*\n\n*Despite there being an option for \"Windows Live Hotmail\", you should use \"POP3\" Mailbox type\n\n*Server: pop-mail.outlook.com (could change over time)\n\n*Username: Your full email address\n\n*Connection: \"SSL/TLS on separate port\", Port: 995\n\n\nHotmail-specific setup guidelines may be found by web-searching for something like \"Set up an email app with Outlook.com\".  You may need to specifically enable POP access in your account.\nAlternatively, you could setup a full email client, and hopefully that will include a new-mail notifier.  I attempted this with Evolution, and the client is working reasonably well, but the notifier isn't working great (under MATE desktop on Ubuntu 14.04).\nLong story short, expect some trial-and-error if you want an email notifier.  mail-notification seems to be sort of working for me, but it has been hard to test -- for some reason, the indicator doesn't want to turn on when I expect it to (like a watched pot never boils).  Explicitly updating when you know that there is new mail doesn't do the trick -- you just have to wait (for an unspecified period).  Also complicating the testing is the error: \"Exceeded the login limit for a 15 minute period.  Reduce the frequency of requests to the POP3 server\" -- if you do too much experimenting.\nOther issues with the mail-notification package:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not under active development\n\n*Doesn't differentiate multiple accounts, or provide any kind of status details\n\n\n\nCommentary: I think the mail notification feature has been a \"collateral damage\" of the recent innovation in desktops (esp. Gnome 3 and Unity).  It is not easy to create an email notifier that works with a variety of server types.  Combining that with something that works with a variety of desktop environments makes for a huge development headache.\nIt's a shame though, since this is a very valuable feature.\n", "Q: Is itoa() available in stdlib.h in Gcc >=4.1? that's my question.

My iPhone is connected via USB to my Ubuntu desktop via a dock. How do I configure it so that when I dock my phone the screen is unlocked and when removing it it locks it?\n\nA: Found an excellent script here courtesy of Evan Boldt on how to do this. Thanks Evan!\nFirst find out the id of your device by using lsusb\nThe create a script under your home dir (let's use /home/me/iPhoneLock.sh for this example) that looks sort of like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Replace with the ID of your USB device\nid=\"ID ffff:1234 Apple, Inc. iPhone 3G\"\nserial=\"12345\"\n\n#runs every 2 seconds\nfor ((i=0; i<=30; i++))\ndo\nif [ -z \"`lsusb -v 2> /dev/null | grep \"$serial\"`\" ]\nthen\n\n    echo \"Device is NOT plugged in\"\n\n    if [ -n \"`DISPLAY=:0 gnome-screensaver-command --query | grep \"is active\"`\" ]\n    then\n    if [ -e /tmp/autoUnlock.lock ]\n    then\n    #stop locking the screen\n    rm /tmp/autoUnlock.lock\n\nfi\n\nelif [ -e /tmp/autoUnlock.lock ]\nthen\n\n    DISPLAY=:0 notify-send -t 5000 --icon=dialog-info \"iPhone Disconnected\" \"Locking     screen\"\n    #lock the desktop\n    DISPLAY=:0 gnome-screensaver-command --lock\n\n    rm /tmp/autoUnlock.lock\n\nfi\nelse\n\n    echo \"iPhone IS plugged in\"\n    if [ ! -e /tmp/autoUnlock.lock ]\n    then\n    DISPLAY=:0 gnome-screensaver-command --deactivate\n    DISPLAY=:0 notify-send -t 5000 --icon=dialog-info \"iPhone Connected\" \"Welcome     Back!\"\n    touch /tmp/autoUnlock.lock\n\n    fi\n\nfi\nsleep 2\ndone\n\nNext, edit your crontab:\ncrontab -e\n\nFinally configure it so that it runs every minute:\n* * * * * bash /home/username/bin/autoUnlock & >/dev/null 2>&1\n\nNote of warning though: Of course this means that anyone with your phone will be able to unlock your screen. A nice improvement would be to only unlock your screen if your phone was unlocked. \nThis of course is applicable to any usb device.\nThe script is licensed under the CC-GNU GPL version 2.0 or later.\n\nA: even simpler script\nuse lsusb to get the device id of the usb device you want to use as your \"key\" and replace it in this script (called checkKey.sh)\n#!/bin/sh\nkey=\"0a12:0001\" #ID of the USB device to use as a \"key\"\nif [ `fuser $0|wc -w` -gt \"1\" ];then  exit; fi  # exit if already running\n\nwhile [ 1 -gt 0 ];  do\n    device=$(lsusb | grep $key) # is \"key\" connected?\n    ss_state=$(gnome-screensaver-command -q | grep inactive) #is screen locked?\n    if [ -z \"$device\" ]; then\n        gnome-screensaver-command -l; #no key, lock the screen\n    else\n        if [ -z \"$ss_state\" ]; then\n                        #key present & screen locked so unlock\n            gnome-screensaver-command -d; \n        else\n                        #key present, not locked, just poke it\n            gnome-screensaver-command -p;\n        fi      \n    fi\n    sleep 10; #sleep for a few seconds before looking again\ndone\n\nthen just cron this to run every few minutes... this way it will start up again if it stops for some reason.... the script should run continuously, but will exit if cron tries to run a second copy.

If I click yes, it comes back after a little while, and if I click no, it disconnects.\nIf I ping any known ip on the other side of the tunnel while connected, I get no answers.\nI were thinking it might need some more privileges to create an interface or something like that, but I don't have any experience with WINE, and know that you should never run WINE as root or sudo it.\nI've also found out that QuickVPN uses some kind of IPSEC, but that it apparently does something non-standard/proprietary, and therefore is not compatible with the IPSEC stack.\nI'm all open for suggestions? :)\n\nA: Some cursory web searching shows that IPSEC uses port 500.  If indeed the client is trying to listen on port 500, you may run into issues because on Linux system you need elevated privileges to listen on ports <1024.\n\nA: I managed to setup a VPN connection from a 14.04 box to a Cisco-rebranded Linksys Small Business VPN router whose default client software is QuickVPN.\nThe software used was the Shrew Soft VPN Client. It is available on the default Ubuntu repositories.

UPDATE: (solved- sort of}  See my answer below  \n\nI have 2 identical USB drives which I've both formatted to identical specs using Gparted.

I have a dual screen, compiz-fusion and i don't have a NVDIA/ATI graphic card and i use ubuntu 10.10.\ni currently use the two monitors: the desktop is stretched across monitors and i can drag an application across monitors. \nMy question follows: i would like to use the left monitor only to display workspace1 and the right monitor to display workspace2. Is this possible ? If yes how (I've found mention of dualXscreen on this board, but i can't find it in the compizConfig menus).\nBest,\n\nA: As far as I know, Compiz doesn't support what you want.\nI've heard that there are other window managers that can.  I don't remember which ones in particular -- Xmonad?  Awesome?  I remember that the one I heard about was a tiling window manager, and decided changing all my window-managing habits was too great a cost for this feature.\nAs a workaround I sometimes mark windows as visible on all workspaces and then keep them on one monitor.\n", "Q: Should I install Firefox add-ons via the Software Center or the webbrowser? I would like to install some Firefox add-ons, also called 'extensions' or 'plugins', like for example Adblock Plus, Ubufox or Greasemonkey.\nShould I install them from the Mozilla website, using the Firefox browser, or should I search Firefox in the Software Center and then select the interesting applications ?\nI suppose the issue is about how the extensions are kept up-to-date. If your answer is 'via the Software Center', how can I migrate well from my former add-ons without losing all my preferences?\n\nA: I would prefer Firefox's inbuilt add-on manager as it contains all add-ons of Firefox and will get frequent updates.\n\n\nA: I'm going to say both, it depends on the add on.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to keep on the outside of the envelope, use the built-in add on manager. Add ons installed this way will be updated frequently, and you will get major version updates.\n\n*If you prefer a bit of stability, use the ones from the repositories. They are (mostly) very heavily tested and pretty much guaranteed to work really well.\nAdd Ons installed from the repositories are not updated between major versions, they only get security and bugfix updates. This is a big plus for stability.\nThe ones provided by canonical are also eligible for canonical's enterprise support, if you're interested in that sort of thing.\nNeedless to say, anything that is operating-system dependent (e.g. ubufox) should be installed from the repositories. The same goes for security-related add ons (even though the only one I can think of is pwdhash). There's no harm (at all) in installing all else via the add on manager. \n\nHow can I migrate well from my former add-ons without losing all my preferences ?\n\nIf you just remove the items from the software centre, your preferences should be kept. But the add on needs to be aware of previous settings, so it may not always work.\n\nA: Mozilla reviews and test every extension public available and approved, which is the case of all extensions in the package manager. So you are pretty safe using Firefox add-ons manager or even downloading from Mozilla add-ons site, as long as you don't download unapproved extensions.\nDownloading from Mozilla has the benefit of getting the most up-to-date versions, which is particularly important for extensions that needs to be updated frequently. For instance I had to release a new version of one of my extensions 10 days ago, because it stopped working due changes on YouTube web site. Six days later, Vimeo changed their web site too and the extension stopped working again, so now I'm rewriting the extension. This doesn't happen very often, but when it does, you get stuck with a non-working extension, if you can't get an update right away. To be honest, I don't know how often extensions are updated in Ubuntu package manager, but I suppose not much, since they follow the same update policy for other Ubuntu applications.\nThe advantage of the package manager would be stability, but if something goes wrong with an extension update from Mozilla, you can always go to the extension page, add /versions to the url and download the last stable version.\nI used to have more than 60 extensions installed in Firefox, and except for Ubufox, all of them were downloaded from Mozilla.\nBottom-line, in my personal opinion, you should get your extensions from Mozilla site.\nBTW, add-ons is a generic term used by Mozilla to describe extensions, plugins and themes. But there is a big difference between \"extensions\" and \"plugins\". What I'm talking about here are extensions, since plugins are not hosted on Mozilla site. They have a page about plugins and the browser has a functionality to check for plugin versions, but the update process is done via developer site. The automatic plugin installation, that is presented when the browser detects you don't have the necessary plugin for a specific content, does not work on Ubuntu and the plugins must be installed manually or via package manager, which is the most common on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Can you do keyframed speed changes with video? I'm making a video and I want to do keyframed speed changes. That is, I want to have a video gradually get faster or slower at different points. I have been a user of kdenlive for awhile but have unfortunately found that is unable to do this. Can any recommend software that can definitely do this?\n\nA: After a year of searching I've finally come across an answer. For this you'll need Blender. I'm using 2.56 beta.\nOpen Blender and switch to the Video Editor\n\nAdd a video to the editor\n\nTo make things easier combine the audio and video clips (make a meta clip)\n\nWith the clip selected add a Speed Control effect\n\nIn the effect properties on the right-hand side first untick \"Stretch to input strip length\". Then hover your mouse over Speed Factor and Press \"I\" on your keyboard. This field will go yellow.\n\nMove to a different point in the movie. Change the value in the Speed Control field and then hover your cursor over the field and press \"I\" key again. You'll see the graph on the left-hand side change to reflect your actions\n\nDo this a few more times and you've just changed the speed of your movie using keyframes!\nThere are many bug reports and feature requests in programs for easy keyframe editing of the speed of movies:\nOpenshot\nBug 524364\nBug 506096\nKdenlive\nBug 336\nBug 397\nBug 289\nVLMC\nBug 205\nNovacut\nBug 680865\n\nA: This appears to be doable with the Kdenlive 21.08+ (21 Aug. 2021) “Time remap” feature:\n\nKdenlive 21.08 is out with […] a new time remapping feature\n[…]\nTime Remapping (Speed Ramps)\nThe new Time Remap feature allows to keyframe the speed of a clip.\n\n\n− https://kdenlive.org/en/2021/08/kdenlive-21-08-is-out/\nThat gif is also all that docs.kdenlive.org has to say about the feature, but in short you can define keyframes, and set a clip’s speed before and after each key frame (including negative speeds to reverse the clip).\nYou can also do these adjustments by dragging keyframes along 2 timelines, where the top is the input (the original clip) and the bottom timeline is the output. Spacing out 2 output keyframes differently from the matching input keyframes will adjust the clip’s speed between keyframes in the output.\nThe effect can be found by right-clicking a clip and selecting “Time remap” − just below “Change speed”.\n", "Q: How can I test  an app in Unity without installing Ubuntu? I want to test my Ubuntu app on Unity.\nI tried installing 11.04 on a VMWare virtual machine. I get a dialog saying I don't have 3d support so I can't turn on Unity. I learn that 3d drivers are not available for Ubuntu on VMWare.\nSo I figure, I'll just use the live CD on my computer itself. (i.e., no VM.) I load the live CD, install the NVidia drivers, but then it asks me to restart in order to use the driver. But if I restart, everything is lost because it's a live CD! I don't want to install Ubuntu on my computer, I just want to try out my app on it.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Running Unity in a VM is a current limitation. Installing it to a USB stick should work better for you:\nHow do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator)\n\nA: You can test the nvidia drivers from a LiveCD but it's not for the weak-hearted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up to the LiveCD\n\n*Install the drivers through jocky (the GUI installer)\n\n*Control+Alt+F1.

This is caused by the driver outputting video to the VGA port on the graphics card, instead of DVI.\n\nThe usual hint that you have this problem is when you hear the startup sound but nothing appears on the screen.

\n # you may need to repeat the update if it complains\n sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAny errors generated by these commands would be most informative when appended to your original question. If the check fails, do as it instructs or stop and post your result.\n\nA: I just had the same problem and found an updated /etc/apt/sources.list file that differed from the previous one in that it used http://76.73.4.58/ubuntu instead of us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu.  When I replaced the newest sources.list file with the old one, the apt-get upgrade worked.\n\nA: You'll need to adjust your sources.list file then run sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get upgrade.\nThose ignore claims are because you may still have a current domain still listed like us.archive.ubuntu.com\nJust make sure in /etc/apt/sources.list you have http://old.releases.ubuntu.com for all the repositories.\nHere is a video URL of my fix I had to test:\nhttps://youtu.be/dDWwcW5e6eI\n", "Q: ls on grub rescue - unknown filesystem \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to fix \"error: unknown filesystem. grub rescue> \n\nMy Ubuntu 10.10 system suddenly froze/crashed for no reason and I had to hard reboot my computer. Surprisingly it doesn't load anymore and stay stuck on a grub rescue prompt after an \"unknown filesystem\" message.

The one with small dots below ubuntu logo.\n\nA: The \"normal\" ls that you are doing is running against the crash recovery pseudo-disk stored in initramfs*. The initramfs contains only enough tools to fix the system.\nYou may find this how to mess with grub rescue article helpful, particularly section \"17 Grub Rescue Image\". \nDoes adding a slash:\ngrub rescue > ls (hd0,1)/\n\nwork?\n", "Q: How to enable 1280x800 resolution in tty? I've got Toshiba U500 (nVidia). Tried changing /etc/default/grub in many ways, now I've got:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=5\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"vga=0x014c\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"vga=0x014c\"\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=1280x800x16\n\n0x014c is what vbeinfo in Grub related to 1280x800x16\nI just wish my laptop could boot with nice, high resolution font and let tty consoles stay that way... How is that possible?\nRegards,\ngocio\n\nA: First, for grub:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nand change the line:\n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nto this:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1280x800 \nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\nNext, add framebuffer to use the card:\necho \"echo FRAMEBUFFER=y\" | sudo tee /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nand don't forget to update grub!\nsudo update-grub\n\nsource\n\nA: *\n\n*Install hwinfo since that is the only way i know how. (sudo apt-get install hwinfo OR sudo aptitude install hwinfo)\n\n*Go to the console (gnome-terminal or any other) and type sudo hwinfo --framebuffer and you will get a short or long list depending on what video card you have. The list will look something like this:\nMode 0x0335: 320x240 (+640), 16 bits \nMode 0x0336: 320x240 (+1280), 24 bits\nMode 0x033d: 640x400 (+1280), 16 bits\nMode 0x033e: 640x400 (+2560), 24 bits\nMode 0x0345: 1600x1200 (+1600), 8 bits\nMode 0x0346: 1600x1200 (+3200), 16 bits\nMode 0x0347: 1400x1050 (+1400), 8 bits\nMode 0x0348: 1400x1050 (+2800), 16 bits\nMode 0x0349: 1400x1050 (+5600), 24 bits\n\n\n*Lets say you want the 1600x1200 16Bit Resolution. Then you take the Hex value to the right, in that case 0x0346 and you write it down.\n\n*Open /etc/default/grub. You will find 2 lines similar to this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nOn the second one, edit that line so it looks like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"vga=0x0346\"\n\nAs you can see you just put the hex value at the end of the linux line in the grub file and save it. Exit, and type sudo update-grub. Wait until it's finished and reboot.\n\nA: To change the resolution of the TTY's (Ctrl+Alt+F1 through F6), the steps outlined on the Ubuntu Community Wiki should do the trick:\n\nThis should work in Ubuntu 9.10 and later, Linux Mint 8 and later, and probably also for any distribution based on those versions of Ubuntu that uses GRUB 2.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Linux while holding Left shift.The GRUB 2 menu screen appears.\n\n*Press C to access the GRUB command line.\n\n*Type vbeinfo Enter to access a list of available resolutions.\n\n*Pick a resolution from the list and write it down.\n\n*Press Esc to leave the GRUB command line.\n\n*Boot into Linux.\n\n*Open /etc/default/grub in your favorite text editor with root privileges.\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\n\n*Add the following line, where you replace 1280x800 by the resolution you wrote down:\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=1280x800\n\nI put it right after the #GRUB_GFXMODE line.\n\n*Save and exit.\n\n*Update the GRUB configuration.\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*Reboot.\nsudo reboot\n\nNow the TTY's should have the specified resolution. Unfortunately, you're stuck with only 16 colors.\n", "Q: How do I reset nautilus to the default configuration? I've reinstalled Nautilus from the maverick repositories after removing nautilus-elementary and the breadcrumb hacks, but I have no longer access to the \"preferences\" menu and the default toolbar. How do I reset Nautilus to the default configuration?\nUpdate: I've tried moving both ~/.nautilus and ~/.gconf/apps/nautilus folders as suggested below, but my \"Edit\" menu is still missing the \"Preferences\" item. Running the nautilus-file-management-properties applet from the command line I'm still seeing the \"Tweaks\" tab that nautilus-elementary added.\nSolved: My problems where caused by the wrong nautilus-data package being installed. I should have replaced the nautilus-data package along with the nautilus one when removing nautilus-elementary. Before that I should have known there was a nautilus-data package ;-)\n\nA: While nautilus is closed type the following in your terminal,\nrm -R ~/.gconf/apps/nautilus\n\nIt will delete the folder with old settings.\n\nA: Just a guess:\nMaybe you could try to delete/rename .nautilus folder in your profile:  \nmv ~/.nautilus ~/.nautilus.bad (rename) or\nrm -rf ~/.nautilus (remove)  \nand then reinstall the nautilus package.\n", "Q: How can I install a real time kernel? Is there a repository I can use to install linux-rt for Ubuntu 10.10? This package used to be available from the default repositories but isn't in the 10.10 repositories.\n\nA: Here you can find the news that the project, do to lack of support has gone to sleep for a while: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RealTime\nAt least as it looks it is going to come back on 11.04\n", "Q: How can I rip an audio CD to an ISO image? It seems I have found directions for using brasero to rip a CD to .iso file, but according to that, brasero is three(3) kinds of broken.\n\n\n*\n\n*recording image as cdrdao does not work, even after reinstalling both brasero and cdrdao. Brasero closes (crashes?) with assertion error.\n\n*same with trying to rip to a .cue file.\n\n*There is no option for ripping to a .iso file.\n\n\nWhat gives? I mean, what should I do? I really want .cue and .iso files, but I don't know what to think about cdrdao. Thanks.\nUpdate: This is an audio CD. Do those make good .iso files?\n\nA: It got a little hard to use before 10.04 came out. In older versions the option to rip to ISO existed. Not anymore. I strongly suggest using AcetoineISO for that it is like Daemon Tools in Windows but better, you can convert image formats to ISO, mount them in special ways, etc... Any way if you still want to use it, when creating the new image rename .toc to .iso. This is for creating a direct image from a CD.\nif you want to transform the .cue .bin .nrg .whatever else to ISO use acetoineISO which makes it very very easy to use. ( sudo apt-get install acetoneiso OR sudo aptitude install-get install acetoneiso )\nIf you want to do it via terminal then first install the needed programs:\nsudo apt-get install bchunk ccd2iso mdf2iso nrg2iso or sudo aptitude install bchunk ccd2iso mdf2iso nrg2iso\nThen depending on the source format you can do in the terminal:\nFrom CUE+BIN --> ISO:\nbchunk source.bin source.cue destination.iso\nFrom MDF --> ISO:\nmdf2iso source.mdf destination.iso\nFrom IMG --> ISO:\nccd2iso source.img destination.iso\nFrom NRG --> ISO:\nnrg2iso source.nrg destination.iso\n\nA: Is this an audio CD? Audio CDs are incredibly difficult to copy to a disk image. .iso files are possible with data CDs and DVDs.\nI recommend ripping an audio CD to .flac files. FLAC is an audio file format similar to .ogg, .mp3 etc but it is lossless - this means that, while the files are compressed, there is no loss in quality. The upshot of this is that if you rip a CD to FLAC files, you have enough information to recreate the original audio CD.\n\nA: A .cue file is a text file that stores information about the data in a binary file, the .bin file, making up the so called cue/bin pair, the .cue file must point to the corresponding .bin file and can contain information about the individual track or tracks encoded in the .bin file, in the case of a Compact disc image, the audio can be encoded as tracks in the .bin file, the .cue files contains cueing (INDEX numbers) information along with CD-Text information of individual tracks, .cue files can even be paired with .wav files the so called cue/wav pair it is made popular by a company called Goldenhawk that made the CDrwin writing software, this format along with .nrg and those from various cloning software are the ones to encode audio cd to, .iso can not be used for audio cd imaging unless you have a special mounting software that can read .cue/iso where the .wav files are stored in the .iso, not all CD emulation software will read the .cue/iso, Daemon Tools on Windows will.\nIf you want to do as dv3500ea suggests, use the banshee media player to rip the cd to .flac format, if you then for any reason need an audio cd image from the ripped tracks or any other tracks in your library, banshee working with brasero can be used to create a cue/bin pair, you do this by selecting the tracks in banshee, right click on the selected tracks and click the WriteCD menu item, brasero will be called up with your tracks ready for writing, you then select the image option, just make sure the image is created in the cue/bin pair format.\nafter saving and brasero finishes you can use a text editor to open the .cue file and make the path pointing to the .bin file relative instead of absolute,this makes the pair more portable, you must make sure the .cue and the .bin files are in the same folder.\n", "Q: Mounting NTFS External Drive with Bit Locker I am a complete novice to Ubuntu/Linux. \nHow do I mount an USB powered external NTFS drive? I've installed both Mount Manager and NTFS Configuration Tool. \nThis drive is encrypted having used Windows Bit Locker. I know the password. \n\nA: BitLocker is not supported by the Linux NTFS driver, you will need to copy the data to a plain NTFS partition.\n", "Q: Is there a way of organize file in Trash by delete-date? In Trash I can organize files by last modified date, and others, but I want to see last deleted files. Is there a way?\nMy \"visible columns\" options:\n\nMy Trash folder screenshot:\n\n\nA: Yes, just go to the Trash folder and click on the heading of the column Trashed On.\nTo see the Trashed On heading, the view must be set to List View.\n\n\nA: Trashed On and Original Location are both features of Nautilus 2.32.0, which comes in Ubuntu Maverick 10.10.\nIf you don't have these columns options in your Trash, all you have to do is update your Nautilus to the last stable version. :)\nhttp://git.gnome.org/browse/nautilus/commit/?h=gnome-2-32&id=87d96729a8f74c5255f7973c257ebcc14fb57e16\n", "Q: How to remove/change saved SVN passwords? I'm using SVN from Eclipse and it has a feature that allows you to save the SVN user and password. It think it uses something called gnome-keyring to do so. The problem is that now I need to use another user to access the SVN repository, but I'm unable to change the previous set user. How can I change/remove that previous user?\n\nA: *\n\n*Goto Applications>>Accessories>>Passwords and Encryption Keys. \n\n*Open the Passwords Menu Entry.\n\n*In the list you will see the password for eclipse svn.\n\n*Delete it and then start eclipse and enter new credentials.\n\n", "Q: How can I run Unity in a virtual machine? Originally it was the case that Unity could not run in tools like Virtualbox. \nHow can I now do so?\n\nA: There is also a ppa for Unity in 2d.  It's how I set up my own VM:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~unity-2d-team/+archive/unity-2d-daily\n\nA: Unity has 3D requirements above and beyond Compiz itself. \nOn top of the 3D required by compiz, which is supported by Virtualbox's 3D support, Unity also requires the OpenGL Frame buffer object extension, which is not supported by Virtualbox's 3D drivers. Wikipedia has a good article on FBO too.)\nBug report: http://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/7835\nHowever this appears to be fixed in the new release of Virtualbox\n\nA: In VirtualBox >= 4.0 Unity is supported and runs nice when Guest Additions are installed.\nXServer 1.10 from 11.04 is supported in Virtual Box >= 4.0.6 when Guest Additions  are installed.\n\nA: Since this question asks about tools like VirtualBox, I can confirm that Unity runs on VMware Player 4.0 and beyond.\n", "Q: Watching a DVD? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I play DVD movies? \n\nI tried to watch a dvd on ubuntu 10.10 but with no success. I went to medibuntu to check that I have all the required repositaries. Everything was up to date. So what's wrong?\n\nA: I recommend to use the VLC player (available from Ubuntu Software Center). In my opinion VLC has the most complete set of codecs. \nBest wishes,\nVincenzo \n\nA: This is what I ran to get DVDs working correctly:\nsudo apt-get install libdvdread4\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nI don't know for certain if the first 2 are necessary for VLC, but I was having problems viewing a DVD until I installed the infamous dvdread/dvd-css.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem. I installed VLC but in addition I also had to install\nlibdvdcss. Now I can play any dvd I want using VLC. \n\nA: From you comments, I'd say the solution is to use a non-defective DVD. Is there a way you could get ahold of a different copy of the same DVD?\n", "Q: What is the minimum requirement to compile Kernel modules I want to compile a Kernel module.\nWhat is the minimal set of packages that I need to download to succeed? \nCheers,\nStefan\n\nA: You need build-essential and kernel headers.\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential\n\nA: At a minimum, you will need gcc and the kernel headers (linux-libc-dev).\n", "Q: What are the differences between Desktop, Server, and Alternate Installs? \nI am trying to figure out what the exact difference is between the 3 different install Disks.\nLike what packages are different and such.\nFor Example:\n- The server disk doesn't install gnome by default and has the non-pretty install wizard.\n- The Alternate Install gives options for encryption.\nAre there any other differences?\n\nA: (just for the sake of doing it I have also included Ubuntu Netbook Edition here)\nSimilarities between all versions\n\n\n*\n\n*All versions support encryption of the home folder.\n\n*All versions use the same application repositories, so that you can for instance install web and mail servers on Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Desktop on a Ubuntu Server or Ubuntu Netbook system (by installing the ubuntu-desktop package), and any other combination.\n\n\nUbuntu Desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*The installer is called Ubiquity, which is written specifically to be a GUI installer for the Desktop/Live CD.\n\n*Includes the Wubi installer for installation for Windows systems\n\n*Installs the basic Ubuntu system, in addition to the ubuntu-desktop package and all its dependencies, including GNOME and various applications, such as Firefox and Empathy.\n\n*You can try the system directly from the CD, and it has a graphical installation.\n\n\nUbuntu Server\n\n\n*\n\n*The installer is debian-installer, which is text based and is shared with Debian.\n\n*It basically is just the base Ubuntu system, but during the installation you can optionally install services such as a web or mail server by using tasksel.\n\n*Ubuntu Server does not include a graphical user interface so it does not install the applications included in the ubuntu-desktop package, such as GNOME.\n\n\nUbuntu Netbook\n\n\n*\n\n*Installs the basic Ubuntu system, in addition to the ubuntu-netbook package and all its dependencies. It also uses the Unity interface instead of the default GNOME interface.\n\n*The installation method is very similar to Ubuntu Desktop\n\n\nUbuntu alternate installer\n\n\n*\n\n*The installer is debian-installer, which is text based and is shared with Debian.\n\n*The alternate installer installs the ubuntu-desktop package, just as Ubuntu Desktop does.\n\n*It is mostly intended for installing or upgrading Ubuntu on machines where this cannot be done in other ways. For instance, I had to use this CD when installing Ubuntu on my machine, because none of the LiveCDs would work.\n\n*Allows setup of LVM and LUKS encrypted file systems\n\n*Has an option for an \"OEM Install\", which allows you to install the OS but leave the personalization like username and password as part of the first boot.\n\n*Option to install an LTSP Server.\n\n", "Q: Synaptic and Software Centre Segmentation fault Synaptic windows disappear after a few seconds when opened. This happens also for the Software Center. On running from the terminal it gives me this phrase \"Segmentation fault\" how can I fix that?\n\nA: The definition of a segmentation fault:\nA segmentation fault (often shortened to segfault) or bus error occurs when the hardware notifies a Unix-like operating system about a memory access violation. (Source: Wikipedia)\nThis basically means that there's an error in the program's code, where the program tries to access a part of the computer's memory that it does not have access to. As this is a very generic error that can occur for very many reasons, it is hard for me to say the exact reason why this happens, and give you a solution.\n", "Q: Converting from Kubuntu to Ubuntu in old install: Fixing the desktop I've been using Kubuntu since 9.04 but I've decided to switch to Ubuntu (read: GNOME) now. I've installed ubuntu-desktop a while ago, I think the system was in 9.10 then. I'm now at 10.10, all via upgrades (never a reinstall).\nPresumably because of this, I'm missing a few things in my GNOME when compared to a clean install of Ubuntu 10.10:\n\n\n*\n\n*Notifications (msn contact online, battery low, etc.) look out of style.

Finding which of these match up with the specific issues you having can be done with google's help.\nOnce you know what the application is, and where the offending settings are, remove the application, remove the settings file/folder (after backing up), and reinstall the application.\n", "Q: How do I install both Firefox beta and Minefield on the same machine? First of all, I am aware of this question concerning installing Firefox beta/nightly .\nI am wondering if there is a simple way to install both minefield (currently pre9) and beta (currently b7. I assume b8 is forthcomming). Both packages provide firefox-4.0. Is this a case where I will have to manually install (and update) one of these myself?\n\nA: Install the Firefox beta as you normally would (with apt-get or dpkg), then do the following steps to install Minefield and create a custom shortcut for it (minefield):\nDownload the .tar.bz2 file from the Firefox Nightly Builds site. Extract the files into a directory of your choice (I'll just use /opt):\nsudo tar xvfj firefox-4.0b9pre.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2 -C /opt\n\nMinefield should now be installed in /opt/firefox.

It allows to easily install multiple versions of Firefox and launch them without even leaving your default Firefox window and without entering any commands. Additionally, each version use it's own profile, thus not messing with your personal settings.\nAlso check my tutorial on how to install Firefox 4 for other options.\n", "Q: How do I open a terminal in the current location?

I have a created a wireless connection from the main admin account and checked the box saying \"Available to all users\", everything is working correctly. I only need to prevent the Desktop Users from switching the connection to another one.\nHow can I accomplish this?\nThanks.\n\nA: You can kill nm-applet (the thing in the bar at the top that let's you choose the network settings), and use iwconfig to choose the wireless network, like this (assuming your wireless NIC is wlan0):\n$ sudo iwlist wlan0 scan\n\nThis will display all available wireless networks.\n\n$ sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid \"MyWirelessNetwork\"\n\nThis will try to connect to the wireless network with SSID \"MyWirelessNetwork\"\n\n$ sudo dhclient wlan0\n\nThis will get an IP from the DHCP server.\nSince the above commands require sudo powers, regular users will not be able to change the wireless settings.\n\nIf you choose, you could remove the nm-applet all together by removing the package network-manager-gnome\n", "Q: How can I prevent Desktop Users from accessing any online website? How can I prevent Desktop Users from accessing any online website? I tried 127.0.0.1 * in /etc/hosts but it didn't do the trick.\nPlease note that I need to keep http://localhost fully functional.\nThanks.\n\nA: The quickest (albeit very circumventable method) in my mind would be to break the DNS lookup. What you're doing in /etc/hosts is close but it doesn't accept wildcards. This is a shame because, like you, this sort of setup would really help me from time to time.\nAnyway, remove the wildcard entry from /etc/hosts and then edit your network connection. If it's wired, you can edit /etc/networking/interfaces, if it's not, you can just go in through network manager.\nEither way, set the connection type to \"Automatic DHCP (Address only)\" or \"Manual\" and then set the DNS server as 127.0.0.1. I assume you're not running a DNS proxy server on the machine (otherwise this won't work).\nIn network manager, this will look something like this:\n\nClick apply. It'll hopefully reconnect and then websites not listed explicitly in /etc/hosts should not resolve.\nThe workaround that any user can use is they can just type in the IP of the website they want to connect to. You'd need to break more gateway settings to fully neuter the machine.\nNote this will probably cut you off from updates. If you want to still get updates, add manual DNS strings to /etc/hosts for each server you connect to (look at what sudo apt-get update does.\n\nA: Another, more robust method, is to install a content screener like DansGuardian. This, with a couple of iptables config lines will redirect all traffic through it and only allow content that it likes. It uses a proxy (either Squid or TinyProxy - the second being my preferred choice) and its config can be set to only allow certain domains.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DansGuardian\nIPTables is the thing that makes this rock solid. Only somebody with root or full sudo access would be able to circumvent this. It's a bit more work than just cutting off DNS lookups though.\n", "Q: Chromium stopped working When I open Chromium the tabs do not load (even the New Tabs). First, I tried to remove (actually, rename) ~/.config/chromium to chromium_old and nothing got better. Then I purged and removed all chromium-browser vestige in my laptop.

I'm working on a site locally that's just sitting in a folder:\n\nlocalhost/tempplace\n\nHow can I route, with Apache2, that to be like:\n\ntempplace:8890\n\nOr just something so it's not a sub directory? It's making local development very frustrating.\n\nA: You need to do two things, the first is to make an apache2 virtual host that will respond to the domain name given and the port used; so in /etc/apache2/sites-available/tempplace.conf which should be symlinked to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-tempplace you should have something like this:\n<VirtualHost tempplace.localhost:80>\n    DocumentRoot /www/example1\n    ServerName tempplace.localhost\n\n    # Other directives here\n</VirtualHost>\n\nOnce you have that part you can restart your apache2 server. Next you have to enable a localhost hostname, to do this you edit the file /etc/hosts and add as follows:\n127.0.0.1   localhost.localdomain localhost tempplace.localhost\n\nThis effectively adds the tempplace.localhost resolve to your local dns and means that browsing to it will point to localhost. You should then be able to browse your Apache virtual server on your localhost without resorting to different ports.\n\nA: Let me add some points to In Protest's answer.\n1). enable the apache userdir module.\nsudo  a2enmod userdir\n\nthis will enable apache userdir module. Now you can put the contents of website in ~/public_html/ or whatever inside your home directory.\nNote: The default folder is ~/public_html\n2). Make necessary changes to /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf.\n3). Restart the apache\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nNow you can access the site by navigating your browser to http://ip-address/~username. \n4) Set a virtual host for this site as in In Protest'answer\nIf you are looking to run php files you need to do one more step\nedit the /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.conf and comment the following lines:\n<IfModule mod_userdir.c>\n        <Directory /home/*/public_html>\n            php_admin_value engine Off\n        </Directory>\n    </IfModule>\n\nThen restart the apache.\nThats it.

I have laptop and the hard disk light lightning every 2 second strong in the meantime there are a lot of fast blinking even though i don't do anything. Even more - hard disk is doing some strange annoying sounds.\nI have ASUS k50ij, 320 gb HDD, 2gb RAM and Ubuntu 10.04.\nAny ideas\nthx\n\nA: This is a clear sign of a failing hard drive, the fact that the computer keeps on trying to access the hard drive is because failures in reading and writing are causing heavy load.\nBackup all your files as soon as possible and prepare to buy a new hard drive to replace the current one.\n\nA: I've lost several hard drives over the years, and once they start making noises you should immediately start planning to replace the drive.  It may last for some time, or it may only last another couple days.  Back up as much as you can to CDs/DVDs or a network location, preferably setting up automated/scheduled backups as well. \nThere's some good information on making backups in ubuntu here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem\nIf you do end up with a failed drive, you can use gddrescue to recover most of the data on it, but it's far easier to restore from backups. \n\nA: I confirm previuos posts. Because 2 weeks ago my colleague has replaced a 320Gb HDD in ASUS X5DIJ (Intel Duo T3000, 320Gb, 2Gb) sold in Latvia (European Union).\n \n\nA: Yes it is true that your hard drive may be on the way out. I had the same symptoms. I turned my computer off for a day, and from there it was fine. Been running fine ever since.\nBacking up your data is always a good idea though. ALWAYS\n\nA: My advice, don't wait to back up your data to any device you can, don't wait until you have money to buy an external drive and when you do get an external drive, don't put all your faith in it as it is only a single drive itself and can also fail! I have had a 1TB drive fail on me...\nIf storage is a problem then cloud storage is one answer, Google, Yahoo (I understand they have up to 1TB of email space, emailing yourself is one way of saving images) use services like Flickr and also One Drive from M$ gives you a few Gigs of storage space.\nAs for backing up your drive in its entirety the dd command I got working, tried the suggested cat command to copy the failing drive, eventually I was able to save one drive but my ASUS laptop HDD has taken the whole PC down as it won't go in to BIOS until its detected the HDD!!! \ndd if=/dev/<your drive to copy> | gzip -c > /<mount point>/<folder>/imageName.gz\n\nand my 64 GB drive took 10 Hours to compress in to a compressed image, IMHO if you have the drive space, don't bother compressing, just store, it will be quicker and I only saved 10GiB in doing compression.\nI haven't restored an image as yet, I only need a copy of the drive as my next step may wreck the partitions completely, hence the need of a back up image...\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Are 20GB packs available without owning a suitable mobile?

If so, there is every reason to expect that it should be less efficient than serial copying.\nFirst, if you assume that the disk is infinitely fast, then there will be the system overhead of context switches between multiple copying processes. In extreme cases you could start enough copying processes that they could not all fit in core at once and then you'd have to add virtual memory swapping to the system's overhead.\nBut disks are not infinitely fast, and gathering multiple files as requested by multiple processes will likely require drive seeks which are the slowest operation on a mechanical drive. The kernel does try to re-order drive accesses to minimize the head seeks required, but this is difficult to make optimal as the system can't predict what will be requested in the future.\nFinally, the system has to protect certain data structures (e.g. the free block list) from being manipulated by multiple processes concurrently which it does by blocking processes P2, P3, P4... Pn while P1 is allocating space.\nBecause your question is ambiguous, another answer is that if you select a bunch of files in nautilus and copy them elsewhere with a single drag-drop, nautilus only creates a single process to produce the copies sequentially. In this case a faster drive would indeed be faster; the question then becomes how much fast can you afford?\n\nA: It's possible that your files are located at different portions of the disk, causing it to have to seek to various cylinders and tracks on the disk surface to find the data. An SSD would improve your performance in that case, by eliminating the physical seeking. However, it can also be possible that when you copy large numbers of files the OS schedules the copy process as a lower priority process, particularly if you are running other I/O heavy processes. \n", "Q: Video doesn't show up when using dual monitor on Acer netbook So whenever I plug my monitor into my Acer netbook for dual monitor functionality, I cannot watch videos on VLC (window is black) or use the webcam on Skype. Does anyone have a work-around for this? Or maybe this is a bug that needs to be submitted?\nThanks.\n\nA: In my opinion, and this is only my opinion. If something requires a work around, then in fact it is a bug. Work arounds are great, but don't help anyone in the long run. Just my opinion. If you could, it would be great if you did file a bug report.\n\nA: I found the problem. I wanted to watch a DVD but VLC couldn't play it, so when I installed the restricted libraries for watching DVDs, this fixed the problem.\n", "Q: When will Ubuntu One be available in German and other languages? Ubuntu One is a very good service. But at the moment nearly everything is in only available in english and not in other languages like german, french etc.. Also the terms of use are only english. Lots of people do not use Ubuntu One because they cannot understand the terms of use completely.\n\nA: There are no plans to internationalise the website at the moment. Because the website contains a lot of commercial information, we can't have it translated by the community like the client.\nGetting professional translations for dozens of languages is a huge undertaking (both in cost and effort).\nWe do, care about all users, but the translation of the website has not yet become a priority for us.\nWhen it is, I'll make sure we announce it properly.\n", "Q: How to move Windows inside Ubuntu without reinstalling? i have installing windows 1st , then ubuntu, at long time ago, now im wondering do we can make windows that had being installed at last , that connected to the ubuntu ,/ dual boot , that may allowing me to acess windows inside of ubuntu, i try to goggling, the result is ask me to reinstalling, the problem is i had lost the dvd installer for windows. any idea how to make the old windows connected with new ubuntu without reinstalling , ? \n\nA: From what I can tell the question is actually about virtualizing an existing Windows installation. If you have an extant Windows partition, you can create a wrapper VMDK (Virtual disk) for it and run it as a virtual machine. This is easiest if the Windows partition exists on its own drive, as you will need a Master Boot Record entry to be able to boot the VM; but if it doesn't, you can still get around it by creating a virtual MBR.\nThis tutorial will walk you through how to do this.\n\nA: You can not simply move windows as if it were a sensible operating system. Your only hope is to reinstall windows inside the virtual machine as you want it to be.\nSorry.\n\nA: I think the real issue here seems to be the missing Windows DVD. I'm going to assume you still have the CD Key sticker affixed to your machine somewhere. If so, you only need to obtain (in any which fashion you like) a copy of the same type of Windows. Your CD key will work on any other disk, provided that it is the same type. So you would need a Windows Vista Home Premium disk to use the Home Premium licence etc. You can't just get a Windows 7 Ultimate disk and use a Home Basic key.\nThis in itself is my motivation for moving to Ubuntu. On the whole I find most programs (sans iTunes) works great in the latest version of wine (www.winehq.org)\nBasically wine allows you to install and run Windows only software and even some games within linux. With the exception for a few weird UI elements or one or two advance features not working.

And should I waste my time trying to make this audio card work or it is simply impossible for linux?\n\nA: Development on ALSA's ctxfi driver generally is very plodding due to lack of open data sheets (so putting pressure on Creative to provide them without the mandatory NDA may help here). You may have better luck with a very recent ALSA snapshot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/InstallingLinuxAlsaDriverModules or OSSv4.2 at http://www.4front-tech.com/developer/sources/testing/gpl/oss-v4.2-buildrc3-src-gpl.txt.

That is, it got to a refreshrate where the redrawing is more than noticeable. It took 5 seconds to redraw a chat window. Ever since I've been using metacity instead, but I've found myself missing some plugins badly.\nI found the following solution:\n export __GL_YIELD=\"NOTHING\"; compiz --replace\n\nThis works fine, everything is fast again with compiz. But how to make sure this variable is always set whenever I run compiz?\nI'm using standard nVidia drivers, failed to get the open source ones working.\n\nA: You could create a simple script to launch Compiz with:\n# /bin/sh\nexport __GL_YIELD=\"NOTHING\"\ncompiz --replace &\n\nName it something like launch-compiz, make it exacutable (chmod +x launch-compiz), and place it somewhere in your PATH like /usr/local/bin Then simply typing launch-compiz in the Alt-F2 run dialog or a terminal will work.\nAlternatively, if export __GL_YIELD=\"NOTHING\" doesn't have any ill effects under Metacity, you can add it to your ~/.bashrc file. That will ensure that that environmental variable is always set. Then you can just luanch Compiz as you normally would.\n\nA: You can make the script and edit /desktop/gnome/session/required_components/windowmanager to point to that script, then gnome-session will still only start compiz once but will use your script to do so.\nOr, if it still works, you can put 'export __GL_YIELD=\"NOTHING\"' in your ~/.gnomerc file.\n", "Q: How to disable an \"always there\" program if it isn't in the processes list? I have Crashplan and it is constantly running in the background and making backups every 15 minutes. It caused some problems with the backup target folders, so I want it to be inactive while I am making changes to these folders. \nI started the application itself, but could not find some kind of \"Pause\" button. So I decided to just stop its process. I first tried the lazy way - the system monitor in the Gnome panel has a \"Processes\" tab - but didn't find it listed there. Then I did a sudo ps -A and read through the whole list. \nI don't recognize everything on the list (many process names are self-explaining, like evolution-alarm, but I don't recognize others like phy0) but there was nothing which sounded even remotely like crashplan. But I know that there must have been a process belonging to Crashplan running at this time, because the main Crashplan window was open when I ran the command. \nDo you have any advice how to stop this thing from running? The best solution would involve temporary preventing it from loading on boot too, since I may need to reboot while doing the maintenance there. \n\nA: From the Crashplan website it looks like it should be starting a process from /etc/init.d at bootup. I would look in /etc/init.d to see if there are any startup scripts that look like they are for Crashplan. You can easily temporarily prevent a startup script from running at boot time by running:\nsudo update-rc.d script-name disable\n\nWhere script-name is the name of the script you see in /etc/init.d that you want to disable. It can be re-enabled later by running:\nsudo update-rc.d script-name enable\n\nThis will put things back the way they were before you disabled the script.\nAlso, the website says you can stop crashplan temporarily by running:\nsudo /usr/local/crashplan/bin/CrashPlanEngine stop\n\nThe path is dependent on where you installed crashplan and will probably only stop the currently running process.\nOne last thing. I find that ps -ax provides more information than ps -A and can be useful when trying to find a running process, especially when the output is piped to grep. If I were looking for a process associated with crashplan I would try a command like this:\nps -ax | grep Crash\n\nI hope this helps!\n", "Q: How do I upgrade MySQL to 5.5, am I best off waiting for it to be available through apt-get?

Is there any way to disable this?\n\nA: *\n\n*In a Nautilus window, Goto Edit>>Preferences and then goto Preview tab and then in Preview sound files select Never.\n\n", "Q: How can I switch between windows of the same application? I often have more than ten windows open at the same time and some of them are of the same applications, notably gnome-terminal. \nOften when I am currently on one terminal, I just want to get to another terminal. With Alt-Tab you have to choose from windows of all the applications, which is a pain. Even with Gnome3 which groups windows by applications and gives preview of windows with Alt-` it isn't enough because it's hard to distinguish terminal windows from previews. You can only tell which terminal does what when the full view is shown in most cases.\nSo is there an application/windowing system/gnome shortcut that shows you only other windows of the same application when you are switching?\n\nA: This is old question, but I had the same problem and found Alt + ` switches the windows of the same application. Thus, sharing the same for reference.\n\nA: If you install the CompizConfig Settings Manager then you can access and change the Compiz settings that can do this. Once installed launch it via System->Preferences.\nIf you normally use Alt+Tab then go the \"Static Application Switcher\". (This plugin shows quite small previews.)\nIf you normally use Windows/Super+Tab then go to \"Shift Switcher Plugin\". (This plugin shows quite large previews.)\nIn the settings for either of the plugins you can set the keyboard (or mouse) shortcut for Next Window (Group) and/or Previous Window (Group).\n\n(Note: as well as the Static Application Switcher and Shift Switcher you may wish to experiment with the Application Switcher and Ring Switcher)\n\nA: I thought I would add to fluteflute's splendid answer how to do this if you are running Metacity instead of Compiz. Unfortunately this cannot be changed through GNOME Preferences, but has to be changed using gconf-editor or gconftool.\nAfter running gconf-editor, find and change /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/switch_group to the key that you want to use to switch between windows of the same application group.\nThis can be done on the command line with gconftool. For example:\ngconftool -s /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/switch_group -t string \"<Mod4>Tab\"\n\n(<Mod4> is the Windows key.)\n\nA: You write notably gnome-terminal, which leads me to believe you are unaware of the terminal multiplexers? Then you're in for a treat!\nA multiplexer sits like a layer between you and the terminal, making it possible to have multiple separate terminal sessions in a single terminal window. You can also easily have several windows within the same multiplexer session.\nAnother nice feature with these is that you can detach them from your terminal session, leaving them running in the background. Perfect when you want to start a long-running job, truly move it to the background and then be able to pull it back out later on.\nThe previous champ was GNU Screen but it is being replaced by tmux, which is my personal favorite. If you try tmux then be sure to also check out teamocil.\nHappy CLI'ing!\n\nA: \nBe careful: Some settings may break an application, so be careful and make sure you know what you're doing. In our case just follow below steps but be careful with dconf editor for any other changes.\n\nIf you're looking to cycle windows of the same application on mouse click then do this\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf editor (Open Ubuntu Software application and search for dconf Editor)\n\n*Open dconf editor when installed and search this /org/gnome/shell/extensions/dash-to-dock/click-action\n\n*Disable the Use default value option and select a custom value of cycle-windows\n\n*Apply your changes\n\nRefer to this SO answer if you don't want to install dconf editor & still achieve the above.\n", "Q: How to limit internet speed?

Just as a test I put the live CD of 10.04 and could not get the problem to duplicate.\nNvidia graphics card... \nAm I so messed up may have to wipe and reinstall 10.04?\n\nA: You need to know that some programs like Firefox have a special memory place for their \"clipboard\", while ubuntu has another. you CAN use the clipboard from firefox to another programa in ubuntu only while you have Firefox OPENED. You can not close Firefox if you want to maintain the information you have in the Firefox Clipboard.\nThis also applies to other programs that do not share the same memory place. Closing the programa you copy from can make the following problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy some info and when you select to paste there is no PASTE option available.\n\n*Select by dragging the mouse over some text and when you want to paste using the middle scroll button there is nothing to paste.\n\n\nSo at the end you need to have the source program you are copying from opened. Also selecting something by dragging on it and highlighting what you want is different from selecting COPY option. They sometimes have different memory places (Depending on the program). For example in Firefox, highlight something and open gedit and paste using the middle scroll button. It will work. No close firefox and test. No do the same but right click and select COPY.\nThat way you know how programs relate when using the clipboard or their own clipboard.\nWish there was a universal clipboard.\nAnother HINT for you is to download glipper. Which saves anything you highlight or copy to a list from where you can grab anytime you want the info.\n", "Q: How to open a remote python program from terminal by ssh? I type ssh -X name@blah.edu and asks for a password,  I type it in and get logged in.\nname@blah.edu:~$  program.py\n\nthen nothing happens, when it should actually pop up. Why is this happening and how do I solve it?\n\nA: The problem is that the SSH connection is not forwarding X11 commands over the connection.\nIf the machine you are using to connect is running Linux (or another OS with X) then simply pass the -X param when invoking SSH.\nIf you are connecting with Microsoft Windows, you will need a program that can translate X11 commands into Windows API commands. Try looking at XMing or cygwin.\n\nA: You may also need to add/uncomment the following line from your /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\n\nX11Forwarding yes\n\nThe -X flag is useless without this.\n\nA: You probably need to enable X forwarding in your SSH server's configuration file, /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nX11Forwarding yes\nIf you don't have access to this file, I'm afraid you will have to ask your sysadmin to enable it.\n\nA: It is just as you do in your PC,\nssh -X remotehost python remotepythonprogram.py\nTo view the program code,\nssh -X remotehost less remotepythonprogram.py\n\nA: It sounds like your DISPLAY variable is getting set somewhere. When I SSH into my machine from my phone (with X forwarding) and run the following:\noli@bert:~$ echo $DISPLAY\nlocalhost:10.0\n\nThough it's not a guarantee, X forwarding tends to use high display numbers.\nIf your ~/.bashrc is set to override the display, you'll likely see something more like like :0.\nYou can either guess and over-override the DISPLAY variable to localhost:10.0 after you connect:\nexport DISPLAY=localhost:10.0\n\nOf find where you're setting display in your local bash files.\n\nI should add that it's possible to turn off X forwarding in the SSHd settings (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) so you might want to check that too.\n\nA: Oliver's solution is the way to go if you want to forward X, but understand that this may be bandwidth-intensive.\nAn alternate solution is to use a command line editor like vim or nano. Personally, I would go with vim. It does have a steeper learning curve, but once you get past that, you will not want to go back to anything else =) You can start learning it by executing vimtutor for a tutorial on the basics.\n", "Q: .exe file permission fail I'm trying to run a exe file that is located on my Vista partition, when I browse to the file and try to change the file to run as executable the tick box unticks itself right after i tick it, i tried running gksu nautilus but it does the same thing\n\nA: This is likely because the Vista partition is using the NTFS filesystem and it was mounted with an fmask that does not permit setting execute permissions on files.\nTo fix this you need to manually mount the partition.\nDetails can be found on this post.\n\nHere are the steps you need to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the drive's corresponding device by opening a terminal and typing: df\n\n*The column on the far left is the device, and the column on the far right is the path for the drive.

I think it is a new security feature. Instead of running it from a windows partition transfer the files to your ubuntu filesystem, and run it from there.

You can pretty much only query the list of available modes and set one, not add new modes.\nSo the failure of the xrandr tool is entirely expected.\nSecondly, the nvidia binary driver abuses the reported refresh rate to work around some pre-XRandR 1.2 limitations with dynamic mode switching and multi-head.  The reported refresh rate for the default mode will always be 50Hz, regardless of what the monitor is actually being driven at.\nIf you disable dynamic twinview in xorg.conf then this restriction is removed, and nvidia will report the actual refresh rate.\nAlternatively, you can use the nvidia-settings tool to manipulate resolutions/refresh rates, and this will display the right values.\n", "Q: External USB 2.0 drive formatted as ext4 periodically \"freezes\" if files are not read or written I have an external USB 2.0 harddisk (Seagate 9SD2A2-500) that periodically \"freezes\" when files on the drive are not written to or read within approximately five minutes.  The drive is formatted as ext4, and I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 64-bit.  \nIf I am editing a file that is stored on this drive, and I do not save the file every five minutes, an open application (such as gedit) will become unresponsive.

What is happening here, and is it possible to change this behavior?\nI have another USB 2.0 harddisk attached to the computer.  The harddisk is formatted as FAT32, and does not show this behavior. \n\nA: I think it depends on hardware (controller) of external HDD. Possible issue: HDD suspending after 5(10) minutes. It could be also a specific management of USB controller in your computer system (USB inactivity time-out).\nControl in Power Management Preferences if 'Spin down hard disks when possible' is switched off. \nGood luck,\nVincenzo\n\nA: This is a \"feature\" rather than a bug related to power management of your external hard drive unrelated to formatting.

I'm having a really hard time trying to understand what the differences between a desktop environment and a window manager are?\n\nEDIT: From this article by Jack Wallen:\n\nThere are basically three layers that can be included in the Linux desktop:\nX Windows – This is the foundation that allows for graphic elements to be drawn on the display. X Windows builds the primitive framework that allows moving of windows, interactions with keyboard and mouse, and draws windows. This is required for any graphical desktop.\nWindow Manager – The Window Manager is the piece of the puzzle that controls the placement and appearance of windows. Window Managers include: Enlightenment, Afterstep, FVWM, Fluxbox, IceWM, etc. Requires X Windows but not a desktop environment.\nDesktop Environment – This is where it begins to get a little fuzzy for some. A Desktop Environment includes a Window Manager but builds upon it. The Desktop Environment typically is a far more fully integrated system than a Window Manager. Requires both X Windows and a Window Manager.\n\nExamples of desktop environments are GNOME, KDE, Cinnamon, Xfce among others)\n\nA: The picture and words from Wikipedia is helpful when I feel really confused by those concepts. display server and DE\n\n\nA: The window manager manages your windows. It puts the window decoration around the contents including the buttons to minimize or close. It allows resizing and moving the windows around, decides which window is on top.\nMetacity and Compiz are two examples from today, twm and fvwm might be remembered by old people like me.\nA desktop environment gives you an overall user experience. It has the panels, the system menus, the starters, the status applets. It needs a window manager, of course, to manage the windows. It might offer a default file explorer and viewer. To streamline, it might even contain default editor, terminal program, or even e-mailer, all made to look alike and work together.\nGNOME, XFCE and KDE are the best known at the moment.\n\nA: There are not clear-cut definitions to distinguish them but there are strong patterns.\nClassical functions of a window manager (WM)\n\n*\n\n*Position and sizes of the windows, as well as repositioning and resizing them.\n\n*\n\n*Layers — some windows are on top, some are below, some are docks, ...\n\n*Positioning via stacking or tiling algorithms.\n\n\n\n*Virtual desktops (a.k.a. workspaces).\n\n*Closing, maximizing, minimizing (a.k.a. iconifying), raising, lowering, etc. windows.\n\n*Focus — determine window receives keyboard.\n\n*Decoration — title-bars and title-buttons (optional, e.g. absent from Dwm and Spectrwm).\n\nClassical functions of a desktop environment (DE)\nSome will mention\nmenus (such as Windows' start menu), task-bars and window lists, but, for example, despite Icewm features those, it is a WM, not a DE.\nThat's because a fundamental point of DEs is that they ship their own set of general purpose GUI applications, such as file managers, image viewers, calendars, and so on.\nAdditionally, quintessential to DEs is a set of GUI utilities for configuration, not only of the DE itself but also of system parameters that could otherwise be controlled via command-line (CLI). Examples:\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard layout can be set via setxkbmap CLI utility. But DEs provide a GUI to manage that, so that users do not have to learn or fuss with the CLI syntax. Likewise,\n\n*Power settings (inactivity time to fade screen, battery notifications).\n\n*Localization (time zones, language).\n\n*User management.\n\n*Display settings (background, resolution).\n\nEvidence and references\nYou don't need to believe me, just look at some packages dependencies in Ubuntu repositories:\n\n*\n\n*KDE includes kmail, muon (software center), kate (editor), juk (music player), gwenview (image viewer), systemsettings (recommended), dolphin (file-manager).\n\n\n*XFCE includes thunar (file-manager), orage (calendar), xfce4-settings.\n\n\n*GNOME includes shotwell (image viewer), libreoffice, gnome-screenshot, and a bunch of others via gnome-core dependency: nautilus (file manager), gnome-software (software center), baobab (disk usage), gnome-control-center (settings).\nand contrast them with window-managers — I3, Xmonad, Icewm, Bspwm —, whose dependencies are system libraries, not GUI programs at all besides the old, classical x11-utils.\nConclusion\nDEs are heavier than WMs.\nIn a sense, DEs act as a valuable bridge for those migrating from Windows/Mac, who are generally heavily GUI reliant, to the GNU/Linux world, that is historically more CLI oriented.\nThat's why some advanced users call DEs bloated. From their point of view, it includes a lot of graphical interface for tasks that are simple to achieve via a command-line. And how come DEs feature a whole bunch of default programs? Such users want to build their own tool-set and can easily do so; They only need a WM to perform the basic and indispensable window operations.\nDon't let snobs drive you away, though. Use whatever you are most comfortable with and gets the job done. If you are curious and want to find out what's happening under the hood and how to deal with the CLI, you'll probably find to be slowly steering away from DEs.\n\nA: The XFCE website has a pretty nice explanation of the components included in the XFCE desktop environment (one of them being a window manager):\n\nXfce contains a number of core components for the minimum tasks you'd expect from a desktop environment:\nWindow Manager\nManages the placement of windows on the screen, provides window decorations and manages workspaces or virtual desktops.\nDesktop Manager\nSets the background image and provides a root window menu, desktop icons or minimized icons and a windows list.\nPanel\nSwitch between opened windows, launch applications, switch workspaces and menu plugins to browse applications or directories.\n  Session Manager\n     Controls the login and power management of the desktop and allows you to store multiple login sessions.\nApplication Finder\nShows the applications installed on your system in categories, so you can quickly find and launch them.\nFile Manager\nProvides the basic file management features and unique utilities like the bulk renamer.\n  Setting Manager\n     Tools to control the various settings of the desktop like keyboard shortcuts, appearance, display settings etcetera. \n\nlink: https://www.xfce.org/about\n\nA: What is a Window Manager?\nA Window Manager is a piece of software that manages windows, allowing the windows to be opened, closed, re-sized, and moved.  It is also capable of presenting menus and options to the user.  It controls the look and feel of the user's GUI.  With Linux or BSD, you have choices.  You are free to select any number of window managers, ranging from lean-and-mean simple ones (low memory and CPU consumption), to feature-packed large ones.  There are approximately 17 \"mainstream\" window managers, and at least 70 others.\nHere is a short list of some of the more popular ones:\n\n*\n\n*fvwm2\n\n*twm\n\n*mwm\n\n*wm2\n\n*AfterStep\n\n*Enlightenment\n\n*WindowMaker\n\n*IceWM\n\n*Sawfish\n\n*Blackbox\n\n*Fluxbox\n\n*and MetaCity\n\nFor a really nice website that lists them all, try www.plig.org/xwinman/.\nWhat is a Desktop Environment?\nA desktop environment (DE) usually rides on top of a Window Manager and adds many features, including panels, status bars, drag-and-drop capabilities, and a suite of integrated applications and tools.  In fact, user opinions on operating systems are typically based on one thing:  the Desktop Environment.  Of course, the DE is only a small part of an OS, and in Linux and Unix systems, the Window Manager and/or DE can be replaced or highly customized without violating any end-user licensing agreements.\nThe most popular Desktop Environments for Unix/Linux are:\n\n*\n\n*GNOME\n\n*KDE\n\n*CDE\n\n*XFce\n\nOf course, there are others.\nSource (Archived).\n\nA: I'll try to be brief. Taking Ubuntu for an example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiz/Metacity (or KWin, XFWM) are window managers. Their purpose is to draw windows, borders, buttons etc.\n\n*Gnome (or KDE, XFCE) are desktop environments, because beside a window manager they package a login screen, panels and systrays as well as certain tools to configure and tweak settings.\n\n\nA: IMHO the Desktop Environment term derives from Window Manager term. As a Desktop Environment is a set of software/tools which builds today's complex visual interface(s) between human being and computer, while Window Manager serves just for creating a simple graphical interface(s) (I remember XWindows on Silicon Graphics station in 1995 :) ).\nRegards,\nVincenzo  \n", "Q: Ubuntu One notifies me every ten minutes that my account is full but there is nothing in it I have checked several times and there are no files, no music, etc. in my Ubuntu One account.

If there's a conflict, i.e. you've changed the file on both sides, it tells you and asks you what to do.\nTo synchronize between more than two machines, use a star pattern where there is a center machine and any number of satellite machines: run unison between each satellite machine and the center machine. In your setup, the server would be the center machine.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Extras keyring error Recently I got lots of GPG errors and tried the following methods at various stages:  \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3E5C1192 \n\n\n*sudo apt-get install -reinstall ubuntu-extras-keyring \n\n(For Ubuntu Extras only)  \n\n*gpg –keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com –recv 3E5C1192\ngpg –export –armor 3E5C1192 | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*sudo aptitude -o Acquire::http::No-Cache=True -o Acquire::BrokenProxy=true update`  \n\n\n*sudo -i   \napt-get clean\ncd /var/lib/apt \nmv lists lists.old\nmkdir -p lists/partial  \napt-get clean \napt-get update \n\nI again got BADSIG error for extras.ubuntu.com today.

I've imported lots of pictures into Shotwell and spent some time setting tags. Are those tags locked-in in Shotwell or I can export them (and import again or use with other software)?\n\nA: Unfortunately Shotwell does seem to keep the tags in its own database rather than embed them as exif, IPTC or XMP in the pictures. You can check by using exiftool, which can be installed by installing the package libimage-exiftool-perl, available in the repositories. \nSee some examples here\nuse the command; exiftool testpicture.jpg to check a photo called testpicture.jpg that you had previously tagged with Shotwell. You will see that the exiftool output contains no Shotwell tags.\nThe exiftool utility can tag your pictures embedding the tags in the photo and the good thing about this is that most photo managers will use them, this includes Shotwell. For example:\nexiftool -keywords=favourite -keywords=family testpicture.jpg\n\nReplace existing keyword list with two new keywords (favourite and family).\nWhen testpicture.jpg is imported into Shotwell the picture will be tagged with favourite and family\nIt may be helpful to know that the Shotwell database is an sqlite database located in your; ~/.shotwell/data directory and usually called photo.db, you can copy it somewhere else on your computer and access it with sqlite.\nThere are a few GUI  frontends for sqlite, there is one for firefox here or you can use sqliteman. Both of these front ends have export to csv features; when you export your tags to csv (Comma Separated Values) you can check if any other photo management software will import and map the tags to the appropriate field in their own databases. I believe Digikam can do this. Digikam can also embed exif data in the photos themselves.\nHopefully as Shotwell gains more features this situation will change.\nUPDATE: While it is true that Shotwell 0.7 does not store its tags in the pictures as these tags are created, the tags can be embedded in the pictures if you choose to export them, thanks Adam for making this clear. Hopefully this export is lossless when dealing with jpegs. I suspect it is, if one selects original size for the Scaling option in the export dialog.\n\nA: I'm the founder of Yorba, makers of Shotwell.  Thanks for your question.\nShotwell 0.7 writes metadata (such as tags and titles) to photos when you export them.  The metadata is written in EXIF, IPTC and/or XMP format (depending on which of these were present in the photo to begin with).  Most other photo programs can read these formats, so if you export your photos from Shotwell then other programs should be able to read their tags with no problem.\nThe upcoming Shotwell 0.8 can write metadata to photo files on the fly - to enable this, select the option \"Write tags, titles and other metadata to photo files\" in the preferences dialog.  Once this is selected, Shotwell will update metadata in photo files as soon as you tag them.  To use this feature, build the Shotwell trunk from source (see http://yorba.org/shotwell/install/#source), or just wait for Shotwell 0.8 (which we plan to release later in December).\n\nA: Quick (dirty?) python code to do this without upgrading Shotwell (I think as of 0.8.x Shotwell can write out tags, but you can't upgrade to that on Lucid). This thing will write out star-ratings as tags (comment that bit out, obviously, if you don't want that).\nRequires exiftool. It'll duplicate any tags that are both in the shotwell database AND the images (ie ones that Shotwell imported when it imported the images) so watch out for that. Also, takes quite a while for a big collection of photos.\nimport os\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\"/home/  username  /.shotwell/data/photo.db\")\n\ndef get_tags():\n    return [ x[0] for x in conn.execute(\"SELECT name FROM TagTable\").fetchall()]\n\ndef tag_query(tag):\n    return conn.execute(\"SELECT photo_id_list FROM TagTable WHERE name=?\", (tag,)).fetchone()[0].split(\",\")\n\ndef get_tagged_photos(tag):\n    for id in tag_query(tag):\n        result = conn.execute(\"select filename from PhotoTable where id=?\", (id,) ).fetchone()\n        if result:\n            yield result[0]\n\ndef get_photos_by_rating(rating):\n    return [photo[0] for photo in conn.execute(\"select filename from PhotoTable where rating=?\",(rating,)).fetchall()]\n\ndef get_tagging_commands():\n    commands = []\n    for rating in range(1,5):\n        for photo in get_photos_by_rating(rating):\n             commands.append(\"exiftool -overwrite_original_in_place -preserve -keywords+=rating%d \\\"%s\\\"\"% (rating,photo))\n\n    for tag in [tag for tag in get_tags() if tag != \"keep\"]:\n        for photo in get_tagged_photos(tag):\n             commands.append(\"exiftool -overwrite_original_in_place -preserve -keywords+=%s \\\"%s\\\"\" % (tag,photo))\n\n    return commands\n\ncommands = get_tagging_commands()\nfor command in commands:\n    print command\n    os.system(command)\n\n\nA: If you want a really good GUI tool/browser that will let you tag your images using Exif tags (and therefore available in Shotwell too), I recommend jBrout.\nI've written about jBrout on my blog.\nTo install it, go to Synaptic, choose settings/repositories, click on the \"Other Software\" tab, then hit the \"Add\" button and paste in this line :\n\ndeb http://jbrout.free.fr/download/debian binary/\n\nThen reload and search for jBrout.\n\nA: Since ~/.shotwell/data/photo.db is identified as photo.db: SQLite 3.x database by file command, I used SQLite Database Browser (sqlitebrowser) to open it.   \nHmmm... you can read it :-)  It has CVS export feature.  \nThis is not normal GUI approach but there is a way.\n\nA: I tried using user38122's script for parsing the shotwell database, and it didn't work.

I have multiple users on my home desktop. I am content with most of the default user directories, however I would like to make one change.\nI would like to setup a common directory for Music (ie /home/common/Music/) that is writable to all users and Nautilus/Dolphin/whatever recognizes as the user's Music directory.\nI know that it would involve changing the xdg user directory setup, but everything I see points that it is relative to the user's $HOME.  Is there a way I can specify an absolute path?\n\nA: Yes to do what you need you simply need to change the xdg configuration for each existing user like so:\n~/.config/user-dirs.dirs\nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"$HOME/Desktop\"\n...\nXDG_MUSIC_DIR=\"/home/common/Music\"\nXDG_VIDEOS_DIR=\"$HOME/Movies\"\n\nAnd to make this something available to all users created simply edit this:\n/etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults\nDESKTOP=Desktop\n...\nMUSIC=../common/Music\nVIDEOS=Videos\n\nTo modify the permissions, this bit is tricky because you need to make sure that all files created in these directories remain editable by everyone. I found this interesting guide on the subject:\nhttp://www.centos.org/docs/2/rhl-rg-en-7.2/s1-users-groups-private-groups.html\nWhich suggests doing the following to make the permissions sticky as well as adding the users all to a common group:\nchown nobody:users /home/common\nchmod 2775 /home/common\nusermod -a -G users user1\n\nYou may want to change the umask setting to allow all files created to be modifiable by the anyone in the users group in that directory, edit /etc/profile and go to the bottom and change umask 022 to umask 002 This is considered secure since all users have their own primary user and really only effects shared directories like this one you want to make.\nLet us know if it works well enough.\n\nA: Alternatively you could set up /home/common/Music (with suitable permissions) and then use a symlink from /home/usernames/Music to /home/common/Music.\nTo do this right click on /home/common/Music (after the permissions on it are set up) and click Make Link. Now move this link to each users home folder and rename it to Music.\n\nNote: all file managers will understand symbolic links. But above is the Nautilus method of creating such links. I'm sure doing the same thing would be equally intuitive in Dolphin.\nThis avoids changing the xdg configuration at all.\n", "Q: How do I install OpsView? Trying to install opsview onto lucid.

I really hope there is a way because I would love to ditch windows and move over to linux full time.\nIs there anyone for whom ubuntu works as it should while running a similar config?\nThanks\n\nA: Prakhar, this is really the hardest kind of question. There are so many things that could make an OS run badly, that it would be impossible to give you a direct answer.\nFor starters, you could try: cold boot, and as soon as you log in, open GEdit (or any text editor you might use), open /var/log/syslog and copy it on http://paste.ubuntu.com and paste the link for us here. So guys around can try to spot weird things.\nIt's not fair to compare it to Windows 7. Any OS could do bad when the conditions are innapropriate.

Slowly, but not as slowly as you described for yours.\nI'm still guessing it could be some part of your hardware slowing you down (in this case, Win7 probably supports it with no problems). But it's just a wild guess.\nWaiting for any logs you could provide us with.\n\nA: I suspect it is the graphics card slowing you down (it is a low end model) - what driver are you using for the card?\nYou should install the Nvidia restricted driver for the best possible performance.\nAlso you mention no issues on Win7 - does it work on the aero interface OK?\n\nA: One of possible solutions:\nInstall previous Ubuntu version (for instance, starting from 9.10) then gradually upgrade to the latest one. In many cases it works fine. Anyway you will see how perfomance is changing from previous version to next one.\n\nA: It is most likely due to a bad VGA driver. You can easily confirm this by selecting Ubuntu 2D before you log in by pressing the button next to the password field.

However, it does not have a Windows (a.k.a Super) key, that I use for many windows-manager-related shortcuts.  On top of it, I use Emacs, so many Alt or Ctrl shortcuts are already taken.  I also can't use Caps Lock as a modifier, since that it is taken for switching between languages.\nWhat keyboard shortcuts would you recommend me for the windows manager (Gnome w. Emerald), taking into account these limitations (no Super key, can't remap Caps, and must not collide with frequent Emacs shortcuts)?\n\nA: Do you already use right Alt?\nYou could map it to the Windows key in Gnome settings:\n\n*\n\n*System->Preferences->Keyboard\n\n*Layouts\n\n*Options...\n\n*Alt/Win key behavior\n\n*Left Alt is swapped with Left Win\n\nOr you could map Caps Lock to the Windows key, and choose another shortcut for changing languages.\nIn the same control panel:\n\n*\n\n*CapsLock key behaviour\n\n\n*Make CapsLock an additional Super\n(or Make CapsLock an additional Hyper)\nand then:\n\n*\n\n*Key(s) to change layout\n\n*too many options to mention\nCommon choices include:\n\n*\n\n*Left Alt + Left Shift\n\n*Left Ctrl + Left Shift\n\n*Left Ctrl + Right Ctrl\nbut being an Emacs user, I would suggest the Both Ctrl keys together option.\n\nIf those options are insufficient, you will need to use xmodmap.\nYou could map Right Control to Windows at the shell like this:\nxmodmap -e 'remove control = Control_R'\nxmodmap -e 'add Mod4 = Control_R'\n\nDepending on your system, you can probably also put the equivalent settings in .Xmodmap, e.g.\n.Xmodmap\nremove control = Control_R'\nadd Mod4 = Control_R'\n\nIf you'd rather use xmodmap than the Gnome control panel, you can change Control_R to something else, for instance right Alt is either Alt_R or ISO_Level3_Shift, depending on your keyboard settings, e.g.\nxmodmap -e 'remove ISO_Level3_Shift = Mod5'\nxmodmap -e 'add Mod4 = ISO_Level3_Shift'\n\nworks for me.\n\nA: From normal desktop usage I can attest to the fact that 'alt' is used far less frequently than 'ctrl' (unless you use 'alt' for menubar navigation). Since I am assuming you have only 'shift', 'ctrl', and 'alt', I would pair 'alt' and 'shift' together - Your thumb could press down 'alt' while your pinky would press 'shift'. This kind of motion is extremely easy for me to use. Also, there are never any shortcuts calling for those two modifiers at the same time.\nI don't use emacs but I'm pretty sure that it uses 'alt' as the main modifier. If so, I guess this runs the risk of conflicting. Thus, the only other usable alternative would be 'ctrl'+'shift'. Of course, if you have one of those context menu buttons then that could work wonderfully (depending on the position).\n\nA: You can create or locate a keymap which treats left and right control or alt keys differently.  I didn't see an easy way to do it from the Gnome panel.\nLook at the options for xmodmap.\n", "Q: How do I set up my laptop for dual boot?

So if you want to be able to install Windows later and want to access all of your hard disk from both OSes then you should choose either Fat32 or NTFS because both Linux and Windows can handle them.\nA better solution would be to use ext3 for Linux partition and NTFS for Windows partition and have a third partition for common files/data and format it to Fat32 or NTFS.\n\nA: In case you buy a new laptop - as you say - you will most likely have some basic Windows OS already preinstalled. You need to complete the setup first sometimes. However all partitions on your laptop will have been NTFS formatted for Windows only use. Some installers give you an option to leave part of your harddisk unpartitioned - very good idea when you plan to install Ubuntu later. If not you will need to shrink your partitions to give an unpartitioned space for Ubuntu. If you have used Windows already it is advisable to defrag your partitions first.\nInstalling Ubuntu gives you the choice of using the entire disk (thus deleting Windows), or to install it in a dual boot setting in case a preexisting OS was detected. Then you will have the choice which OS you would like to boot into but there is no way switching between both OSs during runtime. By default Ubuntu will format the partition(s) in /ext4 format. You can't install Linux on an NTFS partition like you can't install Windows on a Linux partition. Ubuntu can access NTFS (and FAT) partitions by default. No need to install anything else.\nFor testing different Linux distributions, and to see which on meets your needs I therefore recommend you installed them in a virtual machine and play around a bit. You could even simulate the dualboot situation in such a virtual machine and learn how to do it before you go for your main system. However keep in mind that a virtualized OS has a much poorer performance as compared to a real installation.\nI do not recommend any unexperienced users to install Windows after Ubuntu.\n\nA: I would suggest, you install Windows first and then Ubuntu, if you would keep Ubuntu as your primary OS. For a fresh Linux / Ubuntu User, making changes in MBR could be a disaster.\nBest would be to search in google for dual booting ubuntu with Windows and look for the article posted by http://howtoforge.com\nMy experience with this website has been quite good.\nHave fun.....Cheers\nKedar\n\nA: I have used 2 OSes (WindowsXP and Linux) installed on the same computer for about 2 years. Now I switched completely to Linux (Ubuntu 10.10 32bit).\nI had the same dilemma how to access files from both OSes. All my documents were located in NTFS partition. So I had an access to them from WindowsXP and Ubuntu (or LinuxMint).\nNow I moved my main document folder (there are DOC, XLS, PPT, and of course ODT files, photos, even some utilities for Windows OS :) ) to the folder inside my Linux home directory (I preserved the name of document folder, which is 'MyDocs'.\nI can access to MyDocs from VirtualBox machine (sometimes I need to edit original Powerpoint presentations, or to see how some MS Word files should be in MS Word 2003).\nGood luck,\nVincenzo  \n\nA: I would suggest installing Windows first and then Ubuntu later. You don't have to format any partitions. On windows, all you have to do is to go to control panel> and under Administrator tools you will find a parition layout where you can shrink your partition to create some free space.\nAfterwards, it would be really simple to just install ubuntu in the free space. Your grub menu will also be made.\nYou there are tools available that will enable you to access your files such as this one http://www.fs-driver.org/\n\nA: As others have suggested, it is typically better to install Windows first, and then install Ubuntu (or some other operating system) after that.  This is because the free software operating system distributions tend to be more accomodating; they will fix up the boot loading process so that both operating systems can boot, without much effort on the part of the user.\nIf you go in the other direction (that is, installing Ubuntu first and then Windows later), you will lose access to your Ubuntu installation until you bring it back.  That is to say that you will need to fix up the boot loader after installing Windows.  I know that there are some situations where Windows will even wind up doing things strangely and result in a total no-boot situation, though that is not the case I think for the latest versions of Windows (such as Windows 7).  Either way, though extra work is required when you install Windows last over installing it first, for no other reason than Windows assumes that it is the only family of operating system installed on a computer.\n", "Q: start/stop taking too much time On my ubuntu machine, I have squid3 as a daemon which starts at boot. \nThe problem is that squid3 takes a long time to start and stop (more than 30 seconds) and it has also slowed down my OS startup/shutdown time considerably.\nHow can I solve this issue?\n\nA: There is a parameter called shutdown_lifetime.

I'm hearing as how Unity is using nux (and not gtk) for its gui.\nI realise that it's tangled up with Compiz somehow, but I wonder if anyone has considered Unity as the future interface for Kubuntu...\nSo, is it technically feasible and has it been considered?\n\nA: I don't think so. If you don't like KDE interface, just use Ubuntu with Unity and install the KDE applications you like. Personally, I don't even know why that should be considered? I haven't tested Unity yet, but it looks like an improved Gnome-Shell, which was the main reason I switched to KDE. Besides, Unity is an Ubuntu project and Kubuntu is mostly maintained by the community.\nIf they change Kubuntu so much in order to use Unity I would probably move to a different distro.\n\nA: The Kubuntu team has a wide degree of freedom in how they structure Kubuntu - which apps they include and how they configure it by default. I doubt they will embrace Unity immediately, unless it proves extremely popular amongst Kubuntu users.\nThat said, we have done a lot of work to ensure that many key aspects of the interface and API's work across both GNOME and KDE. Menu's, indicators, notifications and lots of other goodness have been built for both GTK and Qt apps and are tested across both Ubuntu and Kubuntu. So Unity should work very nicely as the shell for Kubuntu if you want that yourself or if the Kubuntu folks decide to go that route.\n\nA: i don't think Kubuntu should embrace Unity, but it should customize the tools KDE uses to look somewhat like Unity. bar on the left (unless using RTL language.. and then on the right), notification area on top, and so forth..\n", "Q: How to write an fstab line for full access to an NTFS drive?

As root I can access /win and can see that no permissions are set at all (I supposed umask=777 is meant to set all permissions).\n\nA: With umask you define the options that should not be set. So umask=777 is the same as octal permission 000.\nFor some examples on how to convert between octal permissions and umask, see this Wikipedia entry.\n", "Q: Lubuntu as an official derivative of Ubuntu The four main desktop environments are GNOME, KDE, XFCE and LXDE. While Kubuntu and Xubuntu are considered official derivatives of Ubuntu, Lubuntu is not. Why is that so?\nUpdate: Lubuntu has gained official status in 11.10.\n\nA: At the spring 2011 Ubuntu Developer Summit, it was decided that Lubuntu was on track to become an official derivative with the release of 11.10. More information on the decision can be found in this  16 May 2011 email by Lubuntu developer Julien Lavergne.\nAs stated on their website, Lubuntu still aims to become a recognized derivative:\n\nThe ultimate goal of the lubuntu\n  project is to earn official\n  endorsement from Canonical.\n\n\nA: Lubuntu is now an official derivative. :)\n\nA: According to the Ubuntu website:\n\n[Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, Mythbuntu and Ubuntu Studio] are derivatives that use Ubuntu as their foundation and contribute significantly towards the [Ubuntu] project.\n\nNeither of these are official derivatives (according to this list, there are none), but they are recognized by Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) as \"contributing significantly towards the [Ubuntu] project\".\nLubuntu and any other derivatives of Ubuntu, except those I already have mentioned, might use Ubuntu as a base for their distro, but they do not contribute, or at least not significantly enough, back to the Ubuntu project.\n", "Q: How can I enable flick to scroll?

Under the Quality section choose Sinc (Lanczos3) as Interpolation method and click on the Scale Image button.\nLast methods is probably not as optimal as other mentioned methods\n\nA: The GIMP doesn't have anything like this, but there is a freeware Windows program that has a fractal scaling plugin. Look up Meesoft Image Analyzer. The fractal plugin is a bit buggy, and is offered separately. Usually it works fine, but if it throws out an error, you can usually just try again and get it to work. It is kinda slow, though. \nI'd give you a link, but I don't want to run into any spam filters. I hate that we can't just use the GIMP, but at least it's something. I've not tried it on WINE yet, but there's nothing about the program that should break it.\nBTW, it will also do spline-based interpolation. Heck, that's the reason I originally found the program. Once I discovered it could also do fractal-based scaling, I figured I'd better spread the news to the other sites I found while looking.\n", "Q: How to convince friends using Windows and Mac to switch to Ubuntu How can I convince my sceptical friends using Windows and Mac to switch to Ubuntu?\n\nA: Linux doesn't degrade with the time even if you install / uninstall a lot of software as Windows does\nYou can move the installed OS from machine to machine with little or none issues even with different chipsets/motherboards\nWhen update your OS, you also update your apps.\nYou can use your hardware longer due to less system requirements\nYou can customize the system better\nYou can choose from different Desktop environments (Windows an Mac user don't know even what this means)\nYou can trust software more than \"cool programs\" downloaded from \"a cool site\"\nYou get features others try to achieve with 3rd party software with different success (compiz, multilevel clipboard, virtual desktops)\nYou easily can run services on your workstation to act as a server an vice versa\nIf you don't like a particular Linux Distro, you can pick another one\nYou can develop your own distro (from scratch or based on someone's else)\n\nA: Tell them,    \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu is free and legal.\n\n*That they don't have to worry at all about viruses,Spyware,Adware,Keyloggers, etc\n\n*It's very secure than windows.\n\n*The feautures of ubuntu and support.\n\n\nLook @ the following links,  \n\n\n*\n\n*How to convert Windows Users to Ubuntu\n", "Q: Size of partitions during Ubuntu install I think it would be very helpful to users, if they could know beforehand exactly how much disk space they should allocate while opting for advanced partition method during an Ubuntu installation. \nThat would be helpful for** /, /boot, /home, swap **and other partitions.\n\nA: No need to separate /boot partition really. \nFor / without /home partition, 12-15 GB will be more than sufficient.\nFor /home, it will be where you will be storing all your files, it's more upto you do decide, I personally keep that around 32-35 GB.

Guys, I'm with a little problem here. This version of KDE (4.5.1 - default of Kubuntu) has a strange thing with Dolphin - the file manager. When I click on a menu entry it becomes active (blue) but when I click on the window content it goes lighter. How do i set permantely to blue? That is, how can I have the blue color even when I click on the content window? This was the default behavior on the old version of KDE (4.0x -- 4.4x)\nHere is the example:\nActive:\n\nClicking on the folder content:\n\n\nA: The reason this happens is because there is an option in KDE that tells it to change the color when it loses the selection. Since the list view on the left is a different part of the window than the view on the right, the color changes when you move between them. You can see the same thing in other applications, such as in the system settings lists, and more.\nTo change this, open up system settings (ALT+F2 -> \"systemsettings\", or the [K] menu -> system settings), then go to \"Application appearance\" and select \"Colors\". In the \"Options\" tab, uncheck the \"Inactive selection changes color\" setting, and click apply. You should notice that the color in the system settings list view on the left will change to \"normal\" coloring instantly when you apply this setting. The same setting will then apply across all KDE applications.\n", "Q: How to install Wacom Intous 4 driver?

Each picture is to be placed with in its own slide, centered and enlarged so that it fills the screen. Is there way to do this with OpenOffice, Python or some other tool in the repository?\n\nA: You can give this extension for Openoffice.org Impress a try, it is very easy to install and use, just follow these instructions. It takes a whole folder of pictures and automatically creates a slide show out of them, Works nicely for me. The pictures on each slide are centred as you wish but most photos vary in their aspect ratios so tall photos are fit by height and wide ones fit by width.\nYou can then save as Powerpoint, here is a little tip; before saving your slide as Powerpoint, break the links to the photos in OpenOffice.org Impress by clicking the edit menu item then click links, select all the links and then press the break link button, save the slideshow and then save as Microsoft PowerPoint 97/2000/XP (.ppt) this will have the photos embedded in the Powerpoint slide, even though the file size will be large depending on the amount and size of your photos the slide show will be more portable.\nWhile this does not automatically create the Powerpoint slide show, it could be a time saver as it does automatically create the OpenOffice.org Impress slide show which is easy to save as Powerpoint.\n\nA: You can do this easily with latex/beamer.

Being an early adopter and using 11.04 daily builds I sometimes meet a situation when some packages require earlier versions of other packages than those I have installed. Usually newer (but refused) versions of needed packages provide all the functionality of their older versions.\nIf I use dpkg -i --force-depends-version to install dependent packages everything works fine, I've never seen a problem.\nInstead of manually downloading and installing every package, can I just make the system pretend there is a specific package version installed when there is a newer? Or is there a --force-depends-version key equivalent for apt-get?\n\nA: Despite an answer being already accepted, inlining the accepted better conveys the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a Debian package called equivs that is able to create dummy packages.  Install it by running sudo apt-get install -y equivs\n\n*Once installed, you generate a template \"control\" file using the following command: equivs-control postfix (replace postfix with your package name). In my case, I might use an alternate package name, e.g. postfix-custom or whatever but have my custom package fulfill or Provides the installation dependency of postfix (again replacing postfix for whatever package you want.\n\n*Once the template control file is generated, I will typically remove a lot of the commented out statements (statements that begin with #). One that I like to keep specifically is the Provides: statement where I can say that my package provides the capability offered by the other package that I'm trying to fake, e.g. Provides: postfix tells the Debian/Ubuntu dependency resolution mechanism that my package—of whatever name—provides the same capabilities of the target package, again postfix or whatever. This allows me to name my package independently of the target package to avoid confusion. Erlang Factory does this with their stuff, e.g. esl-erlang provides erlang.\n\n*Finally, once the template control file is created, you use equivs-build to generate the fake package, e.g. equivs-build /path/to/generated/control/file.\n\n*It takes a few seconds to build the package and then you can run sudo dpkg -i my_package_name*.deb\nFor advanced users, if your template control file has a Requires: dependency line, you may want to use a tool like gdebi to install your package as well as the various the packages it declares as dependencies.\n\nA: You can use the equivs package to create a dummy package to fake a given package being installed.

It simply refuses to wakeup from the remote.  The USB receiver shows no activity LED while suspended.  Suspend/resume from the remote works fine from Windows 7 so I know the laptop is ok with it.\nAny ideas?  I need to get this sorted to gain Wife Approval for this system.\nThanks,\nBod.\n\nA: Right!  Problem solved - I found the solution here http://forum.xbmc.org/showpost.php?p=658293&postcount=168\nTo summarise, I noted the vendor and product id from lsusb then created the file /etc/udev/rules.d/90-mcewakeup.rules and populated it with \nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0471\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0815\" RUN+=\"/bin/sh -c 'echo enabled > /sys$env{DEVPATH}/../power/wakeup'\"\n\nnote that you'll need to substitute the vendor and product ids as reported on your system.\nIn addition to this I found that I also needed to edit the line beginning with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= in /etc/default/grub as follows\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash xbmc=autostart,noredir usbcore.autosuspend=-1\"\n\nfollowed by update-grub to finish off.\nAfter all this I now have a system that can wake from my USB remote. :)\n", "Q: How can I automount my hard disk partitions? How can I auto-mount all my hard disk partitions?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install pysdm \n\n*After installation it will be found under System > Administration > Storage Device Manager\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your partition from the partition list and click Mount and then Apply.\n\n*Also for more information you can check this post. \n\n\nA: /etc/fstab is a configuration file that contains information of all the partitions and storage devices in your computer. \nMake an entry there as below: \n/dev/hdb1   /home   ext2    defaults    0 0\n\netc ... just change partition names ,  mount points  , Fstype.  \nYour partition will be mounted on next boot. \n\nA: \nSearch for \"disks\" from dash home. After you click the application called Disks, you should get a window something similar to this.\nClick the Partition you would want and click the gear icon you see below it. Click Edit mount options. You will be presented with a window. Enable the automatic mount options by just sliding it to ON. Do this for all the partitions you want. And you are done! After next reboot, all the selected partitions will be mounted automatically.\n\nA: Download a utility called pysdm. When installed it should show up as Storage Device Manager under System > Administration. You can then set the drive to automatically mount from there.\nWhat it actually does is alter a file on your system called fstab, which tells your system what filesystems to expect, but it's much easier to use the utility to edit it rather than doing it manually.\n\nA: Automatic mounting could also done using udisks a command line tool. This is the modern replacement for gnome-mount. It's not gnome specific.\nWhen you mount a disc normally with the file browser (nautilus etc) it mounts disks by interacting with udisks behind the scenes.\nYou can do the same thing on the command line with the udisks tool. \n/usr/bin/udisks --mount /dev/sdb1\n\nThe bit after --mount is the device name of the partition you want to mount.

In Kubuntu 16.04, you don't need a command line instruction or to install  software. Simply go to System Settngs > Removable Devices > Attached Devices and select Automount on Login. Good work by the developers!\n", "Q: Blocking Remote Login Last night, I was shutting down my server and I saw a message asking if I wanted to shut down a \"pts/0\" session. Odd, I thought. So I logged back in and did a finger and saw that there was someone logged in from a remote IP address (an Italian address) and they were issueing lots of scanssh commands. They had also changed the password for the account they had logged in as (it was my child's account and the password was easy to guess - he's only 6!).\nOK, so I left some ports open - my fault entirely. I was fortunate that the account is limited. There was also a file called W2ksp3.exe (or something similar) in the account's home folder. So I guess someone was using my server to look for compromised windows' PCs.\nSo, my network looks like this:\n\ninternet - eth0 - server - eth1 - LAN\n\nand it was the server that was compromised. The server is using dnsmasq for DNS lookups and a DHCP server for the LAN.\nThis leads me to two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I configure the firewall (iptables?) to block everything on eth0 apart from http, outgoing ftp, e-mail and anything else needed to access the internet?\n\n*How do I stop logins via eth0 but allow them via eth1\n\nA: Good answers so far, but I would also add that throwing a router in between your server and the rest of the internet probably isn't a bad idea unless you really have a compelling reason not to.  If nothing else it's like the door on your house/apartment/domicile/place-of-habitation -- it discourages people from wandering in and looking around, even if there is nothing for them to see.\n\nA: To disable SSH on certain interfaces, just follow these steps:\nFirst, find the IP address of the server on the eth1 using ifconfig or some other method. This could for example be 192.168.0.12.\nOpen your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file (sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config) and add edit the following line:\n#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0\n\n(which means \"listen to all interfaces\") to this:\nListenAddress 192.168.0.12\n\n(which means \"only listen to connections from the interface this IP belongs to\").\nThen restart the SSH server:\nsudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart\n\nNow it should only accept connections from that interface.\n\nA: Just close the port exposed to the public. Usually it is controllable by the router you are using. In ssh's case, it is port 22.\n\nA: For your first question you will need to setup a firewall. If your server is fully exposed to the internet, this is highly recommended. You might want to look at the Ubuntu Wiki. If you have a router it might do this for you.\nFor the second part you might want to configure sshd to listen only to local addresses. That's of course assuming your eth1 has a static ip.\nIn your /etc/ssh/sshd_config modify the ListenAddress line. It should look soething like ListenAddress 10.10.0.1:22 where you replace your static eth1 ip.\nAnd why does your 6 year old child need shell access to your server?\n\nA: I second the recommendations of putting a router between your server and the Internet. It's an easy way of having a first line of defense.\nIn case you ever want to enable ssh from outside, it's a good idea to disable password authentication and keep only public key authentication. That way, you're immune to password guessing attacks: ssh can only be used into an account on which you have deliberately created an authorized_keys file, and only if the attacker has obtained your private key somehow. (You're still vulnerable to remote vulnerabilities in OpenSSH, but these are extremely rare and usually patched quickly.)\nMake sure you have the following settings in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\nPasswordAuthentication no\nUsePAM no\n\n", "Q: Jumping to Address Bar in Nautilus Like F6 in Windows How can I go to the address bar in Nautlius using the keyboard?

I want to install Lubuntu on my old desktop with 128MB of RAM. As the memory is not enough to run the graphical installer, I had to follow the minimal install from a minimal.iso file as described here. However, halfway through the installation when the installer asked me which software I wanted to choose (the list that includes mail server, openssh server...) I chose ubuntu-netbook. That was stupid, because my RAM is really too bad for anything standard.\nNow let's say I have Ubuntu (actually the netbook thing, but that doesn't make any difference in this question I think). I have also installed lubuntu-desktop so I have Lubuntu as well. How can I remove the things that came with Ubuntu, to keep only a fresh Lubuntu installation?\n\nA: Run the following command in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nThis may change the GUI to a lightweight Graphical interface. Although it DOES NOT make it Lubuntu.\nLubuntu has less services, less resource consuming applications, and an overall smaller size when compared to Ubuntu.  \nGRUB 2 will recognize the system installed; I believe the root question is:\n\"Can I replace my current Linux install with Lubuntu, keeping the current partitions and data intact?\"\nThe answer is Yes.\nOnce you boot from the Lubuntu Live CD and choose to install, Lubuntu will recognize this install and ask you if you wish to replace with Lubuntu 'keeping data where it can' and erase everything else.\nI suggest the tech savvy individuals to play with Grub in a VM before attempting anything of this nature on your real system, and also of course backing up everything.   It gets confusing when dealing with multiple installs, where to install Grub and mount points. Boot manager inside Linux can help after an install as well.\nIf you are somewhat tech savvy I also suggest creating your own partitions manually in the future with a /home directory; use Gparted to see how Ubuntu has currently setup your HDD and use that as a template to improve upon. \nIn your case the memory of your system is too low for the Lubuntu GUI install as 256MB is recommended if I recall. But hopefully this will help someone else with a similar issue.\n\nA: Your best bet, to avoid a load of possibly faulty work, is to reinstall, and choose not to install anything extra. Then when it boots, and you log in, you can run sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop from the command line. When this completes, run sudo reboot to restart. Lubuntu should now be what you see on starting your system.\n\nA: ubuntu-netbook is a meta package you can uninstall with this command :\napt-get remove --purge ubuntu-netbook\n\n", "Q: No sound when monitor is turned off I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 on a Revo r3610 nettop with integrated sound (Intel HDA) and graphics (nVidia ION).\nWhen I boot up with the monitor turned on everything works fine. If I then turn off the monitor sound continues to work as normal. However if I boot up with the monitor turned off, I cannot play sound. When I turn on the monitor, it just suspends itself without displaying a picture. If I VNC to the box, the sound icon in the tray shows as muted (three dashes) and nothing is shown in the hardware sound devices panel. The sound card still shows up in an lspci listing though.\nThe monitor is connected via HDMI and the sound is via 3.5mm headphone jack to an external amp. The monitor also has integrated speakers but these are not in use.\nEdit: I've also noticed that the computer only goes to sleep/suspend when it was booted up with the monitor plugged in. Otherwise it stays on all the time. It seems that some part of gnome is not being started properly when it can't find the monitor.\n\nA: I am inclined to suspect that there is some kind of issue with the audio drivers. Since you are not using the HDMI audio device, I would suggest disabling it in the BIOS if the option is available.\n\nA: It sounds like the Revo is saying, no monitor? Oh then I must be a server, so nobody will hear me scream. I might as well turn off audio then, and turn off graphics of course. Pout. \nThis would be a (hardware?) issue with the Revo itself, not with Ubuntu, so the only real solution would be to turn on the monitor before the Revo, or at least at the same time.\n", "Q: Visual effects are not highlighted I installed Ubuntu Netbook edition on my laptop, and in System → Preferences → Appearance, visual effects were not highlighted, so is there anyway to enable it? Now I'm using desktop mode at login.\n\nA: If you want these effects, you would need to install compiz, but I don't know if it would work with Unity installed.\n\nA: It happens also in the desktop edition because you need to have desktop effects activated when using Unity.\nSo if you are using Unity you have the effects, try enabling some of them in Compiz, they will work!\n\nA: Do you have the necessary (in my case the proprietary nVidia) driver installed?\nAFAIK you need it to enable the Visual Effects on the desktop.\n", "Q: How to get Racket in Maverick?

I've created a file sharing server with Ubuntu server and samba, the drive for sharing is on ext4, but all the users are on windows 7/XP\nWould the copy speed be faster if the drive would be on NTFS?\n\nA: There is no relation between a file server source drive and destination drive (from a format perspective).\nUnless you have some unusual extra fast network it is not likely to make any difference. The bottleneck on a file transfer over the network is the network transport itself, reading from the server is expected to be faster. Anyway accessing the data from Linux is expected to be faster using ext4 than ntfs.\n\nA: Indeed. Systems on both ends of the wire are faster with their own native filesystems. Ubuntu uses a (slower) FUSE driver for NTFS, but ext4 is built into the kernel; NTFS is built into the Windows kernel.\n", "Q: Maverick userland under Lucid 10.04 for newer X11 and graphics use My main system runs on Lucid Lynx 10.04, and since it's running rather well I do not wish to upgrade yet.\nHowever the graphics chipset X1700/V5250 doesn't work well for games. The open source driver is insufficient. And the substandard vendor doesn't bother to release the binary driver for current Xorg versions.\nSo that made me pondering options. The notion of using the Xorg-edgers PPA makes me shiver. But I assume it might be possible to install another Ubuntu version as separate userland debootstraped onto my system. Hardy Heron 8.04 would be a good idea if I wanted to persue the binary driver option. This would give me an older Xorg, but I'm very unsure if that fglrx/catalyst driver would be compatible with the 10.04 kernel - since the binary driver needs some kernel hook I believe.\nI've just tested Maverick, and the open source driver is objectively faster than the Lucid version (tested a few 2D/3D games). So this might be a better option. I'm unsure if I will see the same effects, if I just install the 10.10 userland and Xorg. So that's my question.\nCan a debootstrap 10.10 setup /maverick/ actually work under a Lucid basesysten? Any caveats for the installation? And would it be possible to leave my main Xorg running, and chroot into /maverick/ and run the newer Xorg on another VT?\nAlternative: Is there a simpler way than debootstrap to install a secondary Lucid Lynx side-by-side (no partition) so I can toy with Xorg-edgers safely?\n\nA: You certainly could install and use Maverick userland.  Check out my answer to a similar question for a brief howto.\nIt's likely that some of the performance improvement you noticed in 10.10 is due to the newer kernel, and 10.10 userspace might not work properly on the 10.04 kernel.  Fortunately, it's quick, easy, and safe to have multiple kernels installed in parallel.  Grab the linux-lts-backport-maverick kernel from lucid-updates and you'll be able to boot into the newer kernel.\n\nA: Why not test it from a live cd or live usb? Just add the ppa during that session and run the upgrade, log out and back in and see if it works. Unless you need a new kernel, this way will work fine.\n", "Q: Simple gnome panel applet to fetch data periodically over http?

In all cases i have known it boosts the speed to the maximum on the connection to the modem. you must have a router limit, modem limit or maybe you configure something on Ubuntu that changed that (For example trying to see a youtube video while downloading with transmission)\nI repeat in all cases i have known since several years ago, all the PCs i have installed with Ubuntu have reported having better internet speed than any windows version. And that is about 1000 PCs, maybe more.\n\nA: Windows XP reserves some bandwidht for QoS or something like that. Vista and 7 also seem to do that for similar and other purposes. Ubuntu does not do that. As mentioned by others, it seems to be faster than Windows. I recently found that ClamAV (that I use to scan Windows viruses on USB drives) sometimes works in the background and hogs bandwidth. You can install Firestarter (the firewall) and see which application is consuming the bandwidth.\n\nA: I have that modem, but I currently use a differnet one. So I tried testing your setup and checked the speeds on both XP and 10.04LTS. My results came out pretty much the same, but a bit faster on Ubuntu since it doesn't reserve any speeds for itself. My solution for you is you should either try the version 10.04 if you aren't currently on it, or maybe you should try finding a spot with better reception or use a 3G enabled mobile phone.\n", "Q: List of free MMOs for Ubuntu Is there a list of free MMORPG games for Ubuntu somewhere?\nI know of Regnum Online.

I don't have a mobile, my laptops rarely leave home, but occasionally I would like to make a file available to myself (or someone else) away from home. Hence my foray into Ubuntu One. \nMy address book rarely changes, so I really need little in the way of syncing, but I do want to add a bunch of my contacts to my cloud so that they are available to me elsewhere. All I wish to do is export contacts from my home computer and import them to my cloud using LDIF or csv files rather than re-typing 60+ addresses or installing yet another full e-mail client (Evolution) just to get addresses into my cloud. Suggestions?\n\nA: The quickest way to do this, honestly, would be to install Evolution, import your CSV file into the \"CouchDB\" addressbook, and then uninstall Evolution. You don't need to keep Evolution on your machine once you've got the contacts into the cloud, so you're basically using Evolution as a \"contacts importer\" application.\n\nA: Your question is a little confusing, but all you need to do is export from your mail program to a file, save it in your Ubuntu One folder, and import it on the other system.\n", "Q: Expect script that enters a username and password I am trying to run an expect script, that everytime the prompt says user@blah's password, it enters the password I have the following expect script but it seem to be acting up. \nCan anyone tell me what i am doing wrong?

Up until today, I was using AWN with Maverick, including their custom indicator applets. I've decided to switch back to the default gnome panels with dockbarx, but when I add the indicator applet to my panel, it's not displaying the same items as the applet on my Lucid machine. In particular, the network and Dropbox icons are not displaying.\nWhen I look at the About entry for the apps, Lucid shows version 0.3.7, whereas Maverick shows 0.4.6. Did they really remove the network information from the applet in Maverick, or do I need to do something to enable it? My network is very definitely connected, as I still have AWN running and can see the icon there.\n(A second question, although not particularly important: the applet doesn't inherit the transparency of the panel it's living on - any way to change that?)\n\nA: Only one notification area can be displayed at a time. That means that because you have a notification area in AWN, the notification items will not show up in the panel. To get the icon into your panel, remove the notification area applet from AWN.\n\nA: Did you add \"systray\" to the gnome-panel? The network-manager should be displayed then. \nThe systray-applet can only be started once, so if it runs with awn, it would not be displayed in the gnome-panel. It will be displayed on that panel you started first.\n\nA: Add the notification area to your panel.\n\nThe answer to your second question is complicated: it depends on the theme as well.\n", "Q: Installing indicator-network loses network devices I posted a question a little while ago about the network icon no longer showing in the indicator applet after upgrading to maverick. After reading this post, I looked in synaptic to see if I was missing any of the indicators, and it showed that indicator-network wasn't installed, so I installed it. Restarted my computer, and now all my network devices are gone.\nI removed the indicator applet from the panel, but still have AWN running, so I looked at the network icon there. When I click on it, instead of showing me all my wireless network options, all it shows is \"No network devices available\" (greyed out), and \"VPN connections\" with an available submenu of \"Configure VPN\". \nWhen I open the Network Connections dialog through the System Preferences menu, it shows a list of connections accessed in the past, including the wireless network I want to be connected to (and which was connected as of 8 minutes ago.)\nWhat did I do? As far as I know all I did was install an indicator icon, so why did it completely delete my network stuff? And more importantly, how can I get it back?\n\nA: indicator-network installs Connection Manager, which replaces network-manager. \nThis page on the wiki explains how to make them coexist by switching between them, or you can just remove connman.\n", "Q: How to resize the Unity launcher?

I'm using Ubuntu 9.10\nThanks\n\nA: This is not possible.  The VESA driver uses the VESA BIOS interface to interact with the video card.  This is an absolutely bare-minimum interface compared to current technology - it dates back to the MSDOS days, before 3D acceleration and when the available VRAM on the graphics card limited your maximum resolution.  Driving two monitors was not a priority at this point!\nMultiple displays on a single graphics card, and indeed driving multiple graphics cards, requires card-specific knowledge.  As VESA has no card-specific knowledge, it can't do it.\nThat said, we should have appropriate drivers for virtually any piece of graphics hardware you try to run Ubuntu on, and these should support multiple monitors.  If you've got problems with those, that's probably where to look, rather than trying to get VESA to do what you want.\n", "Q: Nautilus doesn't see setgid I want to share a folder for two users, here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*created group\n\n*add users to group\n\n*set chmod\n\n*set chown\n\n*set setgid 2775\n\n*reboot\n\n\nAfter that:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo test > /Common/testfile  -> group readable&writable\n\n*Created file using Nautilus -> group readable, but not writable\n\n*Copied file using Nautilus -> group readable, but not writable\n\n*Created file using gedit -> group readable&writable\nWhy? Is it a bug? This was on a clean Ubuntu 10.10 installation.\n\nA: If you want to get specific permissions for every file in folder, using ACLs is probably most robust way to do it:\nchgrp YOUR_GROUP_NAME /Common\nchmod g+s /Common\nsetfacl -d -R -m group:YOUR_GROUP_NAME:rwx /Common\nsetfacl -R -m group:YOUR_GROUP_NAME:rwx /Common\n\nWith ACLs filesystem permissions do not matter. Your program can set filesystem permissions (for example read only or no permissions for group).\nSGID bit for folder only forces setting group name, but not permissions.\n", "Q: Unity under NX? I've been reading about how the new Compiz-based Unity has issues with virtual box and what not.  \nSince NX effectively sets up a virtual interface/session, will Unity work within an NX server session?\nHas anyone had any experience with this yet?\n\nA: Unity on Compiz, for Natty, is designed with 3D graphics in mind. I believe that won't work across an NX session. But you'll still be able to use the \"Classic\" interface, with panels top and bottom in 11.04.\n", "Q: How to enable Moonlight?

I know how to install TrueType fonts (by copying them to /usr/share/fonts/truetype and doing sudo fc-cache -f) but what about OTF formats?\nI didn't find a suitable folder to copy them to.\n\nA: Using the standard library on Linux, the OTF fonts don't loads.\nMust install addictive library based on your system configuration, libotf for example.\n\nA: You have to create the folder '/usr/share/fonts/opentype', then add the 'otf' file with the font that you want to include, it works for me!\n\nA: The directory you're looking for is /usr/share/fonts/opentype. If it's not there, you can just create it. Copy your OTF files there; this will install the font for all users. Then, recreate the fonts cache with the command sudo fc-cache -f -v.\nYou can also install fonts per user at ~/.fonts/. It makes no difference whether they're in any sub-folders or what type they are. Mine, as an example, are organised by foundry.\nAlternatively, you can just double click them, this will open them with the Font Viewer, which let's you install them with one click:\n\n\nA: If you are copying your OTF fonts in ~/.fonts or /usr/share/fonts/opentype remember to replace the spaces in their name with an underscore like\nFont Awesome 5 Free-Regular-400.otf --> Font_Awesome_5_Free_Regular_400.otf\nIt did not work for me if they were not named in this manner\nI don't know if it was a problem with my system or if it is like this only.\n\nA: Another approach is to convert the OTF font to TTF.  There are free online converters where you upload the OTF font files and they are then converted to TTF.  You then open with the font viewer and install as per usual. I've just done this and the font installed fine.\n", "Q: How to lock workstation in Xubuntu? How to lock workstation in Xubuntu (XFCE, XFWM)?\n\nA: As of 16.04, there should be light-locker because of LightDM.  Use:\nlight-locker-command -l\n\nto lock your workstation.\n\nA: You use program called xflock4, I can really remember what is the shortcut to that bu i thing it is Ctrl+Alt+Delete. Anyway if it doesn't work make sure it is installed.\n\nA: I recently upgraded from Xubuntu 11.10 to Xubuntu 12.04 LTS, which made the <Control><Alt>Delete stop initiating the lock for some unknown reason.  \nTo work around this (and reinstate the original behavior), you can go to Xfce Settings, then Keyboard, then Application Shortcuts.  You should find the original <Control><Alt>Delete shortcut for xflock4.  But now try adding a new shortcut for the same command (xflock4), by entering what you believe to be \"Control\", \"Alt\", \"Delete\".  The shortcut entered in will say <Primary><Alt>Delete.

It's a really powerful tool and I'll try to explain it and provide a workaround for a common gotcha.\nWhat xargs does is take a line from the input, and append it to another command, executing that other command for every line in the input. So by typing locate foobar | xargs rm -f, the output of the locate command will be patched onto the end of the rm -f command, and executed for each line produced by locate foobar.\nThe gotcha:\nBut what if there are spaces in your line(s) returned by locate? That will break the rm -f command because the arguments passed to rm need to be files (unless you use the -r switch), and a file-path needs to be escaped or quoted if it contains spaces.\nxargs provides the -i switch, to substitute the input into the command that follows instead of just appending it. So I'd change the suggestion to \nlocate foobar | xargs -ixxx rm -f 'xxx'\n\nwhich will now only break if the filenames returned by locate contained apostrophes.\nI have to concur with qbi, that you should be careful about using rm -f !\nUse the -p flag to xargs, or just run the locate foobar by itself before feeding it to xargs, or drop the -f from rm.\nlocate foobar | xargs -p -ixxx rm -f 'xxx'\n\n", "Q: How can I find out what RAM a computer system has?

I would like to understand the flow of the USB events form the Kernel space to the User space (just out of my curiosity, in knowing how things are implemented).  \nTo be more clear, I would like to know how does that pop-up comes in my desktop when I plug a USB drive to my system and how does the drive gets mounted.  \nI would also like to know how it finds out if some images are present in my USB and if \"yes\" , how it asks me whether I need to open it in GIMP or some other software?  \nI know its a very big and wide question, but please guide me with some pointers on how to understand the whole idea behind it.   \nI have not done large code browsings, but I assure you that I have no problem in doing so if I can be guided correctly.  \n\nA: *\n\n*Device is plugged in, and the software that manages the hardware bus for that device receives an interrupt (or other notification at the hardware level), and the bus driver enumerates attached devices, or performs other bus-specific hardware actions to identify the device.\n\n*Kernel requests to load a driver for the new hardware by calling /sbin/modprobe with hardware's bus/device/etc identifier.\n\n*In user-space, modprobe tries to find a matching driver-specified alias. (See /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.alias for the complete list.) These will look different based on the hardware interface. For example, pci:v0000102Bd00002527sv*sd*bc*sc*i* for a PCI device vendor 102B, device 2527, and anything for subvendor, etc, or USB: usb:v2040p4982d*dc*dsc*dp*ic*isc*ip*.\n\n*once the device driver is loaded (or a new device that already had a driver is initialized), the driver in the kernel sends a notification of the loaded device to udev in userspace.\n\n*udev matches the notification against its list of rules in /lib/udev/rules.d/ and /etc/udev/rules.d. From here, the behavior is extremely specialized, based on the rules.\n\n*In the case of a USB disk, the 80-udisks.rules file is likely the best place to work from. These rules will use things like blkid and other helpers to probe the type and contents of a disk, populating all sort of configuration values including things like ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\"1\" to ignore a disk for some reason. See \"man 7 udisks\" for details.\n\n*The udisks-daemon watches for devices to appear in the udev database, and presents them them as a discoverable list of devices over DBus. (See \"udisks --enumerate\".)\n\n*Various actions are configured in udisks, and the policy for allowing those actions can be seen in the policy file /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.udisks.policy. (Who can mount, umount, etc.)\n\n*Services that are interested in devices will listen for DBus events from udisks, and take actions when they see certain conditions. For example, GNOME's Nautilus (via gvfs volume-monitor) will request automounting for devices (via udisks, which will check its policy, mentioned above).\n\n*Once a filesystem has been mounted, those same listening services will take more actions. For example, Nautilus will ask if you want to open F-Spot when the common photo storage directory DCIM is found on a filesystem.\n\n", "Q: Binding mouse buttons to copy and paste Often I'm copying and pasting pieces of text.

Glippy, which I use, allows me to do this.  It has a setting that makes anything you highlight automatically copied to the clipboard and whatever is in the clipboard pasted by midle clicking.  I'd don't use this because it's incredibly annoying, but the option is there.  Glippy: https://launchpad.net/~bikooo/+archive/glippy\nTo do exactly what you want you can use xte.

I have created a live usb from an Ubuntu 11.04 daily cd image using usb disk creator. I have bandwidth constrains so I would like to update the live usb from a current daily cd image without downloading an entire image.\n\nA: I have tried two times and it worked for me (But i do not know if this is the correct way to do it). First you need to create the first Live USB following the USB Creator steps.\nThen when a new update comes just overwrite the files that are newer than the ones in the usb. Well in my case everything in the dist, pool and casper folder. It worked the two times i have tried but am talking about when 10.10 was in beta till it was released.\n\nA: When you create the USB startup disk, you have the option to partition off so much of the disk into what is known as a persistence file. This file allows you to save your files and settings so that they are available next time you boot up the live image. The option in question can be seen in the below figure as point number 2:\n\nI haven't tried it myself, but this is how I would go about it.\n\nA: It fails because the file system has been compressed & made read only. When it updates the updates are applied uncompressed, taking up a much larger space. I had 500 MB of updates which took up 4 GB. This is enough to fill a 4 GB casper-rw file. \n", "Q: How to set up Java-based services for startup?

(start-stop-daemon ?)\n\n\nIn my case I am interested in setting up Jira, which has its own Tomcat-style start and stop scripts - $JIRA_HOME/bin/startup.sh and $JIRA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh.\n\nA: Most of the time you can cut out a lot of the code in those scripts and just focus on running the the main program. If you can tell it to run in the foreground instead of the background that will make things simpler. Otherwise you have to use 'expect fork' or 'expect daemon' to follow the forks that a program must do to detach from controlling terminals.\npre-start is mostly for setting things up, like creating dirs in /var/run. You can also source a config file, as the environment will be passed along to the main exec.\npost-start can be helpful if you want to make sure that upstart doesn't consider the service started until a certain condition is met (like the port is answering queries).\nUltimately, the goal is to make it as simple as possible. If the startup.sh runs 'jira --daemon' and you can instead run 'jira' and it doesn't detach, then with upstart you'd just do\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nexec jira\n\nAs long as the process doesn't daemonize, its very easy for upstart to track what it is doing, which ultimately leads to a simpler job file and a more robust system.\n", "Q: How do I get an SB X-Fi Xtreme Audio CA0110 working again after a kernel update?

This question mentions that Unity will use nux as the toolkit. \nWhat exactly is nux?\n\nA: Nux is a OpenGL based widget toolkit and canvas used to create user interfaces, similar to GTK+. At a high level, nux is broken down into 3 libraries. \n\n\n*\n\n*NuxCore\n\n*NuxGraphics\n\n*Nux\n\n\nNuxCore is responsible for basic things like a type system, math functions, color definitions, etc. It basically provides all the primitive types for a widget system (color, rectangle, point). Very little logic is present here, this is a foundational library.\nNuxGraphics is a thin OpenGL abstraction layer. It provides simplifications of common OpenGL patterns (pushing and popping clipping rectangles, changing render targets, state setting, etc), however it does not directly forbid users from making raw OpenGL calls themselves. NuxGraphics provides abstractions for textures and loading/unloading data.\nNux is a widget library implemented on top of NuxCore and NuxGraphics. Nux contains a duplicate for almost every major widget in the GTK stack as well as several composition widgets (color picker, graphs, 3d views). The Nux widgets are not yet at the same level of complexity as GTK widgets, lacking advanced text rendering (being fixed) and clear theming support.\nRendering inside of nux could be described as “canvas style”. Nux provides a painter to perform basic drawing primitives which can be used in addition to embedding other widgets. So rather than embedding an hbar to create a horizontal line, a widget author may, at their choice, use the painter to draw the bar directly. Images may also be rendered in this fashion, rather the embedding an additional widget simply to render a static non-reactive image. This does not however rule out simply embedding widgets.\nIn Unity nux is used in what we call “Embedded Mode”. Essentially nux provides a function for painting itself in a foreign open gl context. We call the paint function and nux blits itself onto the backbuffer. We can then continue to paint on top of it if we desire (sometimes we allow compiz to do this). There are functions provided to do opengl state management in embedded mode.\n", "Q: Does anybody know software for customising audio themes?

The new graphics card I installed had an audio output on it (for HDMI), so the onboard sound was not being enabled.\nTo fix, I switched into the BIOS when my computer was booting up, and changed the 'AUTO' setting to 'ON'.\n\nA: Yep, have just experienced the same, thanks for this post.\nJust needed to turn the BIOS audio settings from AUTO to ON.\nHave spent hours over many days researching this, and trying loads of different things.

I have an HP laptop  with Windows 7 installed.\nHow can I use Ubuntu in full-screen mode via virtualbox or any other software?\n\nA: I had similar problem. I changed the resolution in display settings and now I have the full screen. I right clicked on Ubuntu desktop and selected Display settings and then changed the resolution to appropriate size. That was it.\n\nA: *\n\n*In virtualbox [Host Key] + F works for fullscreening.\n        \n\n*By default your Host key will be Right Ctrl in VirtualBox. \n\n*You can also change your host key,to change your host key open virtualbox and then goto File menu and choose preferences.\n\n*In preferences choose input,you can see your host key there.\n       \n\n*You can change it if you need. \n\n*Also you have to install Guest Additions to enable full screen mode.\n\n\nInstalling Guest Additions for full screen\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Devices and choose Install Guest additions on the top of your virtualization window.\n \n\n*Open the Guest Additions folder which should be on your Desktop in Ubuntu or in Places menu, and open Autorun.sh in terminal by double clicking on the autorun.sh file and picking run in Terminal from the pop-up window button options.Type in your password and wait a few minutes to install guest editions.\n\n\n*After installing Guest additions restart your virtual machine(ubuntu).\n\n\n*Now you will have better performance and bigger display resolutions.\n\nA: While karthick87 explains how to put VirtualBox in \"full screen\" mode, you should also install virtualbox-ose-guest-dkms, virtualbox-ose-guest-utils & virtualbox-ose-guest-x11 inside the virtual machine first.  (Otherwise only some basic low VGA/VESA resolutions will be available.)\n\nA: The new VirtualBox  version 4.0  has a new feature that allows Dynamic screen size setting (to match the host resolution) by just resizing the window (a feature VMWare has had)  and now the X11 config is not so important. \n\nA: Just download the latest edition of Guest Additions iso file and install them irrespective of the version of Virtual Box you are using.\nLink to install Guest additins iso : http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/ Click on the latest version and then download the VBoxGuestAdditions_'version_'name'.iso file\nAfter installing just restart your machine.! :)\n", "Q: Will Natty have the netbook-edition Icons?

When my computer goes to console mode (booting up, shutting down or Ctrl + Alt + F1)), the text is super big. I can't take a screenshot of it, but it looks like a 640 x 480 resolution. My monitor normally works at 1440 x 900.\nI remember that the console text that appeared while installing from the CD was nice and small.\nHow can I make the console text look like it looked while booting from the CD?\n\nA: I've found a solution that works from this forum post\nIn short:\nOpen /etc/default/grub with your favorite editor as root.\nLocalize the line that says GRUB_GFXMODE= ... and change it to the resolution you want. Add another line for a new variable called GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD with the same resolution. It should look similar to this:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1440x900x32\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD=1440x900x32\n\nSave and exit. Then edit as root /etc/grub.d/00_header\nLocalize the line that says if [ \"x${GRUB_GFXMODE}\" = \"x\" ] ; then GRUB_GFXMODE=... . As before, change the resolution there to the one you want and add another line for payload:\nif [ \"x${GRUB_GFXMODE}\" = \"x\" ] ; then GRUB_GFXMODE=1440x900x32 ; fi\nif [ \"x${GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD}\" = \"x\" ] ; then GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD=1440x900x32 ; fi\n\nFinally, locate the line that says set gfxmode=${GRUB_GFXMODE} and add a line for payload below it. It should look like this:\nset gfxmode=${GRUB_GFXMODE}\nset gfxpayload=${GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD}\n\nSave and exit.\nStill as root, refresh grub with\nupdate-grub2\n\nReboot, and both the grub menu and the console should have nicer resolutions.\nFinished!\n\nA: Just some personal background: in my other computer I have no problem with that fancy mode (it's 160 cols x 60 rows, but it has a 4:3 CRT monitor). It's equipped with a TNT2 (yes, I swear), and that mode was promptly displayed on first boot. Problem is, it does this by loading the nouveau driver, and this guy is still a bit faulty (in my case, it hangs the whole system when trying to move windows). So, to have an usable system, I had to downgrade to the old and stable nv driver, and also disabling mode-setting ('cause the kernel would always load nouveau when enabled). Note that I'm not using nVidia proprietary drivers, but like you, I was switched back to 80x25 in console mode.\nThis is because the nv driver doesn't use kernel mode-setting. Now, I don't know about the proprietary drivers, but I'm guessing they might have changed your configuration in order to be usable, and possibly that's why you're seeing that \"big\" mode. Possibly they disabled mode-setting when installed. That's why you see the \"small\" text mode when booting from the Live CD.\nYou could try booting up with a different VESA mode, but that depends a lot on your hardware. For that, please check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions#Linux_video_mode_numbers. For example, if you'd like to try booting your text mode on 1024x640, you'll find that the mode ID is 877.\nSo, when booting, hold the SHIFT key (in case you don't have a GRUB timeout) to bring up GRUB's menu. Select the mode which you wish to boot and press 'e' (to edit the commands). At the end of the \"kernel\" command, add vga=877. The number is the mode ID, if you want to try other modes, replace it with the desired number.\nAlso, at that same Wikipedia page, you could also try the helpful \"Universal format\" right below the modes table. That hwinfo command is quite useful.\n\nA: Why i answer this threat even if it's very old? The answer is pretty easy, because so many other threat refer to it.\nIf vbeinfo or hwinfo --framebuffer doesn't show the native resolution of your display, then disable vesa, to do so remove vga= options in:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nSearch for GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= and remove vga= if you find it.\nIf you have remove the option don't forget to generate a new grub.cfg:\nsudo update-grub\n\nIf you don't know you did it well, then just reboot and open a terminal:\ngrep vga /proc/cmdline\ngrep -ir vga /etc/modprobe.d/\n\nIf grep doesn't show anything, then you removed the vga= option.\nNow install uvesafb:\nsudo apt-get install v86d\n\nMake sure the uvesafb module is included into your initrd.

Name it Hide.  \n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport commands\nfrom os.path import join\n\n\nfiles = commands.getoutput(\"echo $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS\")\ncwd = commands.getoutput(\"echo $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI\")\ncwd = cwd[7:]\n\nfor f in files.split(\" /\"):\n\n    f = f.split(\"/\")[-1]\n\n    commands.getoutput(\"echo \"+f+\" >> \"+join(cwd, \".hidden\"))\n\n\n*Run the following command to install the script:  \ncp Hide ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/ && chmod u+x ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/Hide\n\n\n*In Nautilus, select one or more files/folders and right click. Select Hide from the Scripts menu:  \n\nReload the current location ( F5 ) and the selected files/folders will be hidden.  \nCommand line\nSay you want to hide a folder called \"Rick Astley's Greatest Hits\", just run the following command:  \necho \"Rick Astley's Greatest Hits\" >> .hidden\n\n\nA: Open synaptic and search for \"nautilus-hide\" install it. Logout and login. Now right click on any file or folder. You will now see a \"Hide\" option in the Context Menu.\nIt will not modify the name but hide the folder.\n\nA: I modified Alvin's good script to be (hopefully) more Pythonic (and potentially faster if many files are added, since .hidden is opened only once):\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os\n\nfiles = os.environ[\"NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS\"].split()\n# According to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NautilusScriptsHowto\n# the list is newline-delimited, which is split()'s default separator\n\n# No need for NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI\ncwd = os.path.dirname(files[0])\n# Assuming all selected files are in the same path, I cannot imagine why not\n\n# Instead of relying on \"echo ... >> ...\" use Python's IO:\nwith open(os.path.join(cwd, \".hidden\"), \"a\") as hidden:\n    hidden.write(\"\\n\".join(\n        [os.path.basename(f) for f in files.split()]))\n\n", "Q: Are there easier ways to report about malfunctions experienced while using Ubuntu other than using particular bug trackers? I use Xubuntu on a computer with an Intel 82852/82855GM video card and have a nasty problem with video playback: after some time of playback a video player screen comes just blue, and when I close it my screen is filled with garbage and the system hangs. The workaround I've found is using mplayer with -vo x11 to render it software. I understand (because the same case caused similar problem in Arch I used half a year ago, not just Ubuntu, and the problem never occurs when I use other window managers than XFWM) that this is probably a problem of the combination of My Intel card with XFWM. From this comes the problem - where to submit the bug - to XFCE bug tracker or to Intel one (which I even have no idea where to look for). At the same time I wouldn't like to register in those issue trackers just to use them once. So I am not straight about submitting the bug, but can explain clearly how to reproduce it, which, I believe can itself still be a useful contribution to the community.\nSo, is there a way to submit a bug I've experienced without complications, for better-qualified specialists to review it and put into corresponding issue trackers themselves if they aren't there yet?\n\nA: We really encourage you to use the bug tracker even if you aren't sure which package(s) the symptoms affect. A dedicated team will triage your bug report and assist in engaging the relevant upstream developers so that an appropriate fix can be developed, tested, and made available in an Ubuntu release.\n", "Q: Howto convert audio files to *.m4a? I want to convert a lot of *.flac and some high bitrate *.mp3 files to *.m4a files. \nI want to use a fixed bitrate of 192kb (stereo) and want to keep the audiotags (except of, obviously, the tag \"bitrate\" - this sshould nbe set to the correct 192kb.).  \nI'm using 64-bit Maverick.\nI tried about every program I could find. \nIncluding \n\n\n*\n\n*Sound Converter \n\n*soundKonverter (KDE) \n\n*WinFF \n\n*Arista Transcoder, Handbrake, Transmageddon (fails, seems only video works)\n\n*ffmpeg (tried \"-acodec libfaac -ab 192k -map_meta_data outfile.m4a:infile.mp3\")\nBut either they don't transfer the tags \nor they don't offer any way to set the bitrate to fixed 192kb \nor the resulting file doesn't show the new bitrate in any audio program \n(for example: nautilus saying \"bitrate\" n.a.\")!  \n\nA: I'd stick with ffmpeg. You weren't far off. Here's what I've just used to convert a load of 50-meg flacs to 5-meg m4as, complete with metadata:\nfind -name \"*.flac\" -exec ffmpeg -ab 192k -i \"{}\" -map_meta_data \"{}.m4a\":\"{}\" \"{}.m4a\" \\;\n\nYou could expand that to clean up the original files or save them somewhere else (I was actually struggling with that bit).\nFor some reason, mine was crawling along at 190kbits/s so there might be a better encoding string (I should hope there is, this is a bit silly).\n\nA: You can try this program, found in the medibuntu repository. It is command line, however it might be just what you need:\nhttp://packages.medibuntu.org/maverick/aacplusenc.html\nIt will probably only input wav files, otherwise your best option is soundconverter (which does not support fixed bitrate).

This means that when you load Ubuntu (the windows Ubuntu) you only have a very limited amount of space, but your hard drive shows a massive Ubuntu partition with a ton of space which isn't being used.\n\nFrom your image here you can see in (1) where the ntfs partition (which is windows) is mounted as the host. Where as the Ubuntu partition (2) isn't mounted at all as anything. Also the new Ubuntu partition you've made (3) is where I think you've resized the Ubuntu partition (2) and created a new space, which is also not being used or mounted.\nTo solve this mess you need to back up all your files, delete the new partition and resize the Ubuntu partition back to 300GB. Then go into windows and uninstall Ubuntu from windows. Then see if it will boot into Ubuntu, if it will then job done. If it won't then you need a new install and you need to use the Ubuntu Live CD from boot (not from windows) in order to install it directly and not using a wubi install.\nComment here if you're having issues or need someone to talk you through it.\n\nA: This is a pretty old question, but the solution is here for future googlers:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeandDuplicateWubiDisk\nIn Summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download this script: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeandDuplicateWubiDisk?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=wubi-resize_1.5b.sh\n\n*Now cd to the Directory it's in and just run it:\ncd ~/Downloads && sudo bash ./wubi-resize_1.5b.sh [GB]\nNote that there is a limit of 32gb but you can skip it with --max-override.\n\n*After the script is completed it will instruct you to reboot into windows, rename the file \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk to \\ubuntu\\disks\\OLDroot.disk and then rename the file \\ubuntu\\disks\\new.disk to \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk\n\n*Do not delete the OLDroot.disk until you have confirmed the new root.disk is working (or keep OLDroot.disk as a backup). \nBut the most efficient solution is to perform a Live CD install:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to boot from a live CD/USB. This won't work while running Wubi.\n\n*Backup the root.disk (not required, but a good idea)\n\n*Mount the NTFS partition that your root.disk is on (this example assumes it's /dev/sda1 and the mountpoint is /media/win - adjust accordingly in the following instructions):\nsudo mkdir -p /media/win\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/win\n\n*Check the size of the root.disk (not required)\ndu -h --apparent-size /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\n\n*Run fsck on the root.disk\nfsck -f /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\n\n*Resize - specify the desired final size (this example resizes to 10 GB)\nresize2fs /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk 10G\n\n*Reboot back into Wubi Ubuntu\n", "Q: How can I repair casper-rw file system file in LiveUSB While booting Ubuntu and mounting my casper-rw file for persistent storage, Ubuntu recommends me to check for errors using fsck.

I'm using mf to add the image and I always get a video with about one second of audio with a reported length of 0:00. I've tried with a variety of mp3's and images from different sources and I tried using various codecs and options but I can't seem to get past this problem. Here's the basic command:\nmencoder \"mf://image.jpg\" -o out.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mjpeg -audiofile music.mp3 -oac copy\nDoes anyone know how to do this or why mencoder cuts the music to one second?\n\nA: It's because the default FPS is set to 30, so mencoder expects 30 images per second -- you have to tell mencoder to use one image for whole record, so you have to set FPS to 1/\"duration\".\nAdd this options:\n-fps 1/132.8 -ofps 30\n\nwhere 132.8 is duration (in seconds) of your audio.\nSo result should look like this:\nmencoder mf://image.jpg -o out.avi \\\n        -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mjpeg -audiofile music.mp3 \\\n        -oac copy -fps 1/132.8 -ofps 30\n\n\nA: I only have came with an alternative where you would provide the same image from a pipe:\nfor x in `seq 1 55`; do cat image.jpg; done | mencoder -o out.avi -fps 1 -ovc lavc -demuxer lavf -lavfdopts format=mjpeg -audiofile music.mp3 -oac copy -\n\nwhere you would replace 55 with the number of seconds you wish (this would be the length of the song, as you wish).\nBut, as you can see, it's dumber than the simple and straight-to-the-point answer by Vojtech.

I love fish. I have a nice Ubuntu 8.04 Server running some services. So I edited the /etc/passwd file, as I did in the past, to change my default shell from bash to fish. And ,yes, I made I typo (BTW: I know about chsh, I'm just that stupid and overconfident). Please, stop laughing.\nAs expected, now I can't login. Is it possible log in without restarting the server?. I know that I can restart the server in safe mode and solve the mess, but I'd like to avoid it.\nOh yeah, I have no other user with sudo rights in that server. Stop laughing again.\nBTW, I made the mess using ssh, but I have easy physical access to the server, it's just a couple of rooms away.\n\nA: Unfortunately, no; you've locked yourself out. SSH won't let you log in if the shell is missing. Here's what the attempt looks like in /var/log/auth.log:\nDec 23 15:04:59 ubuntu sshd[5585]: User kees not allowed because shell /bin/fish does not exist\n\nAnd on-console TTY login will always attempt to launch your configured shell. Without another user with sudo rights, you'll need to boot to single user mode to fix it. :(\n\nA: If you have a root password set, you can either log in as root on the machine itself (Either in X or on a virtual console by hitting alt-F1), or remote in as a non-sudoing user and then switch to root using su in a terminal.  \nOf course, Ubuntu doesn't let you log in as root by default, so this assumes you had previously changed that.\n\nA: If you want to restore some configuration files back to some previous state, you can always try to edit them, by booting your server with a Live version of some Ubuntu CD, mount the actual partition where the /etc files are located and edit them using vi. \nYou could also edit the file /etc/sudoers, in order to give more users the rights to become root. \n", "Q: Ubuntu One Music app for Android not displaying artwork I haven't been able to get my album art to display in the android app and have been searching for answers all morning.

We've not implemented the needed bits on the server for this (we only implement a subset of the subsonic API).\n\nA: We are actively working on scanning and displaying album art, so expect it to start working within the next month or two.\nIt won't require any work on you part, it will just start working one day  :)\n\nA: I think you've answered your own question. 30th September was not that long ago - unless you've seen something elsewhere to suggest this should work then the likelihood is that it is still not yet supported.\nSubsonic for Android is a separate application, so what works there won't necessarily work in the Ubuntu One Music application. \n", "Q: How do I get musical backing tracks to be heard in videos I take with Cheese? I just discovered the Cheese Webcam Booth, and for all practical intents and purposes, it is perfect for what I want to do in shooting videos of myself playing my electric guitar. I am using my BOSS GT-10 effects processor as my external USB soundcard, and on my videos, my guitar comes through like a champ. My problem is this: I need my pre-recorded backing tracks to come through in the audio on my videos, yet they are not coming through. What do I do to effect this?\n\nA: You will need the pulseaudio volume control application - pavucontrol. Once you have this installed, open cheese, and the program you wish to record from (for example, rhythmbox). Begin recording a video in cheese, and set a track to play in your audio application. Leave these running and open pavucontrol from your menu (it is under sound and video as pulseaudio volume control), and click on the recording tab.\n\nIf will show you Cheese as one of your applications. Set cheese to record from the output of your system/the other program (it will appear as a sink). Now, you can stop the recording in cheese (delete it if you like) as well as the song/track in your audio player.\nNow, for the rest of this session (that is, until you log out or restart), cheese will record from the other application, as opposed to your mic.\n", "Q: Nagios3 crashes with SIGSEGV I installed nagios3 on ubuntu server 10.04.1.

Now she managed to get some malware in her Firefox on Ubuntu.  Without access to the computer (or when I get it next week), where should I look, what questions can I ask, what could I tell a computer novice to try over the phone?\nSymptoms:\nWhile surfing some recipe site she had an ad-window pop up with no window controls. She rebooted the computer and when she re-started Firefox it came back, full screen, no controls, on top.  \nI told her to just use -F2 and xkill to get rid of it, which it did but stopped Firefox completely. On re-start it was back, I told her to hit F11 which did take it back to a large screen, but not full-screen, so she could see that there was a normal browser window running underneath. She topped the normal window but the only other thing I had time to check was plug-ins, which there wasn't anything that sounded suspicious. I'm looking for ideas of what to try over the phone, or where to start next week.  \nI'm comfortable with the command line, and using about:config if that makes any difference in the answer.\n\nA: I don't think there's much value in tracking down exactly what the problem is. Of course there is always some value but I can't guarantee you'll ever find out what the problem is.\nIn Etcher-Sketch terms, it's easier to just shake it until you have a blank canvas and then, if you want, you can pull back some of the less-likely-to-be-infected things (general settings, bookmarks, etc).\nBut the easiest install vector for malware in Firefox is through its extensions manager. You can check the extensions.ini file in the active profile for anything suspicious, but as I say, it may bear no fruit.\nTo get things back to normal, let's shake Firefox:\nNuke the old profile.\nHere's a little script that moves the old profile to another location. I'm making this up as I go, so there might be a bug or two in it. You should be able to copy and paste this into a terminal.\ncd ~/.mozilla/firefox/\nexport FFPROFILE=`cat profiles.ini | grep \"Path=\" | sed 's/^Path=//'`\nmv $FFPROFILE $FFPROFILE.BAK\nrm profiles.ini\n\nWhen Firefox next launches, it will create a new profile.\nSave bookmarks, saved passwords, etc\nAfter firefox has created the new profile, you can go to ~/.mozilla/firefox/ in nautilus and copy back some of the files into the new profile and then deletes the profile configuration file so that Firefox has to create a new profile. Start by closing Firefox and then punch these lines into a terminal:\ncd ~/.mozilla/firefox/\nexport FFPROFILE=`cat profiles.ini | grep \"Path=\" | sed 's/^Path=//'`\nexport OLDFFPROFILE=`ls -1 | grep .BAK`\ncp $OLDFFPROFILE/*.sqlite $FFPROFILE/\n\nYou can of course do both these parts manually. It's actually easier to do it manually, you just need to know your way around the filesystem a little better. I was just thinking of you needing to do push this off to somebody else... it might just be easier if they copy and paste it into a terminal... Or you do it via SSH.\n\nA: Can you have her install a different browser to keep her going in the short term?\n", "Q: How to upgrade to a newer version of a package than is available in the repository?

I think my request will make little chance because the rules read:\n\nApplications to be backported must have meaningful benefits to the user not attainable via other processes. Specifically: The sole purpose must not be to fix a bug or security vulnerability. \n  \n\nOr is there another way to do this correctly?\n\n\nA: In this particular case then the GRAMPS website provides a download link for a Ubuntu .deb package of version 3.2.5.\nOn this listing page select gramps_3.2.5-1_ubuntu10.deb which should be easily installable by double clicking on the downloaded file.\n\nA: Go for 1st => remove the version I have currently installed with the package manager. Download the source of the newest version and compile it myself? \nWill this give problems when newer versions come out? => No. \nWill I have to update this program manually in the future whenever newer versions come out? => No \nOther option is to request repo managers to update software or you can just wait for them to update.\n", "Q: How to solve this problem starting new Opera-windows on dual monitor-setup?

It is java application and available for linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gpsprune/ - ubuntu's page for GPSPrune\n\n*http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/GpsPrune - OSM wiki's page for GPSPrune with detailed description:\n\n\n\nGpsPrune is a free, open source, cross-platform program to view and edit coordinate data like GPS tracks.\nViewing data with a map view using OSM maps \nEditing data (delete individual points or sections, variable compression, combine and rearrange data, create and edit individual points)\nGpsPrune can read files in the following formats: kml, including zipped and gzipped kml files and kmz files\nGpsPrune can also save data to files in the following formats:\n  kml and kmz files (kmz files can include photo thumbnails)\n\n\nA: If you're having problems with Google Earth in Ubuntu then you could try using Google Maps to view your .kml files.\nAs detailed on one of the Official Google blogs:\n\nTo view a KML or KMZ file on Maps, just go to Google Maps, and instead of searching for a geographical address like 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, 94043, search for a complete Web address (including the \"http://\" part) of your KMZ file, like http://kml.lover.googlepages.com/cropcircles.kmz. Need your own web space to upload some files? Try Google Page Creator.\n\nGoogle Page Creator has been shut down and Google now encourages to use Google Sites instead.\n\nA: You can view them online with GPS Visualizer.  You load them directly with Viking GPS Analyser.  \nYou can also convert them to GPX files using Viking or GPSBabel.  Both are available from the Ubuntu repos. See Viking GPS Documentation for details.\n\nA: I also suggest to use a free conversion tool, like this one: kml2gpx.com to convert them into gpx files. It is a simple and convenient way to get the results you need.\n\nA: Any software reliant on GDAL for data input should be able to import KML files. On Ubuntu the most recommendable option is QGIS, that supports KML seamlessly. Using the Add Vector Layer dialogue you can import directly a KML file for visualisation and analysis.\n\n\nA: For even more possibilities, you can try OSGeoLive, a Xubuntu-based live DVD loaded with GIS software.\n", "Q: Windows 7 Virtualized on Ubuntu Server I have an issue, we are moving to a production build server now. I need a virtual machine up and running on my Ubuntu 10.10 server edition. I have to setup and install various tool and plugins, on this windows 7 virtual machine as well\nThe problem I am facing is how do I install windows 7 on this machine ( ubuntu 10.10 server) also, how am i supposed to gain access to it in order to install tools that are required on it. \nI would prefer virtual box as my tool of choice. \nPlease and thank you. \n\nA: If I understand you correctly the problem is likely that you lack the VirtualBox GUI.\nVirtualBox has a quite powerful command line. You can create your machine with:\nVBoxManage createvm Name\n\nYou will need to use\nVBoxManage modifyvm options\n\nto configure the machine. You can create a virtual hd with:\nVBoxManage createhd\n\nYou can read the manual online. It's very complete and there are even more options than using the GUI.\nFirst, you can't use the .deb file, because it will bring Qt and all it's dependencies with it. You should use some of the alternative install options.\nFinally, configure VBox virtual CD to use a Windows.iso or the server real CD and start the machine with:\nVBoxHeadless -s MachieName\n\nThis will start the machine and listen for RDP connections on port 3389 (default). Just use rdesktop or a similar software from your desktop to connect to it and do all the windows install stuff.\n", "Q: can I turn off window grouping with dockbarx? Is there any way to turn off window grouping with dockbarx? I use the Prism app to create standalone windows for gmail, my corporate webmail, and a few other sites. Because they all use Prism, instead of displaying as separate shortcuts with the custom icons I assigned to each when creating them, they all display together under a single Prism button, using the Prism icon.\n\nA: In case anyone else is interested in ungrouping Prism windows (this is ONLY for Prism), the DockbarX developer responded to another question of mine and indicated that he's hoping to include this functionality in the next release. Again, this is ONLY for Prism windows; he's not planning on allowing ungrouping of \"normal\" apps.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I was unable to find an option to disable this behaviour, and I would suggest you report a bug to the dockbarx developers (if you don't want to let me know and I'll do it). The only option I could find was to show a window list, but since you are using launchers, you won't be able to accomplish this with Dockbarx.\nYou could however use a drawer on gnome-panel to achieve a somewhat similar effect (plus an extra click, unfortunately).\n", "Q: Error out of disk, grub rescue I installed Ubuntu via usb with no problems, but when I restart, I get an error message: \nerror out of disk\" 'grub rescue.\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Apparently this error occurs when GRUB can't find a usable grub.cfg. Since the boot configuration isn't there, GRUB drops you to the grub-rescue prompt. Following these instructions you should be able to boot Ubuntu. \nOnce you've booted Ubuntu, reinstall GRUB2 by running\nsudo grub-install\nsudo update-grub2\n\n\nA: For anyone who might be searching for a solution: I had this problem after a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.04 on my HP nc6400 laptop. The problem was solved by installing Ubuntu via the alternate installation cd. http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/alternative-download\n\nA: Its sounds like you have made a partition for the install files that is small enough that is is getting the messages Ubuntu added to make users aware of running out of space. It shouldn't hurt anything unless the OS grows beyond the amount of extra you have. The simple solution is to install GParted found in the Ubuntu Software-Center. You can simply drag the portion used as the swap space to make it a little bigger and stop the warnings. It's best to do it soon since there's always a small possibility of data loss when changing partition  sizes.\n", "Q: How to make Google SketchUp work with Intel graphics in Wine?

When i try to login it takes about 2 to 4 minutes and after that it shows an error that says:\n\nP2P connect failed.\n\nNote that Skype was working with me yesterday.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: This actually isn't Ubuntu related, they've had outages all day.\n\nA: It is not a Ubuntu specific issue. Skype got a problem in their network. Now things are retuning to normal. You can find more updates on skype's twitter page: https://twitter.com/skype \n\nA: The Skype server takes the IP addresses of all logged in users and exchanges them to those wishing to connect. If the Skype program had the ability to either accept an IP address or loads the last used IP address, the Skype server need not be invoked for a simple P2P connection unless a dynamically assigned IP address changes. If the Skype server is down, the new IP address may be manually input when Skype programs the function into the next revision of Skype.\n\nA: Try removing shared.xml from ~/.Skype/ and restarting Skype.   \nHere's a kludge of a script that does it for you.

I have been wanting to try Natty Narwhal really bad. So about a week ago I tried it, and it was not at all stable. I know it's still in development but I desperately want Unity, I even reorganized my gnome panel with dockbarx and gnome window applets to try to emulate Unity. I tried Maverick early and it was great. :D (getting a little off topic here....) But anyways ;) When is Ubuntu Natty Narwhal 11.04 going to be ready for stable testing?\n\nA: You can use stable release in April-2011\n\nA: When it's released.\nI don't mean to sound snide because I'm being serious. No pre-release version is recommended for production use. It may crash and break everything.\nIf you don't care about minor glitches, the beta releases and release candidates in late March through April should give a fairly robust experience.\nTrying it at alpha stage is not recommended if you're not completely confident with all areas of an Ubuntu system.\n\nA: Ubuntu version numbers are the year and the month of any release, so 11.04 is 2011 April.  Anything before then is an unstable pre-release version and should only be used if you are okay with bugs and instability.\nCloser to that date, there will be several beta releases followed by a few RC (release candidate) releases.  I've found that previous ubuntu versions are mostly good by the time the second beta comes out, which tends to be in the month or so before the official final release date. Even so, there may still be major bugs in the betas.\nMore about ubuntu's release process: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/ReleaseProcess\n", "Q: Can I set a delay on startup sounds?

As for startup sounds, they should play fine (you shouldn't need to delay them; they'll continue to play after your desktop is available).\nIn System / Preferences / Startup Applications verify that \"GNOME Login Sound\" is enabled:\n\nTo configure a custom start-up sound, you'll have to create it manually at the moment:\nmkdir - ~/.local/share/sounds/mysound\ncd ~/.local/share/sounds/mysound\nln -s /the/sound/file/you/want.ogg desktop-login.ogg\n\nAnd then in the same directory, create the file index.theme:\n[Sound Theme]\nName=MySound\nInherits=ubuntu\nDirectories=.\n\nThen you'll be able to select your theme in the drop-down of System / Preferences / Sound / Sound Effects / Sound theme.\n", "Q: Installing suggested/recommended packages?

This also resulted in the\nSystem > Preferences > Sound\nsettings box showing the mic, whereas it did not show up before.\n\nA: Take a look at this: \nSkype doesn't find my audio input\nOriginal answer by @Treviño, Posted here for your convenience: \n\nThe only way I've found to make my\n  internal mic work in my laptops is to\n  use pavucontrol (install it from the\n  homonymous package) and disabling the\n  volume of a channel (the right or the\n  left one), since most of microphones\n  are mono in fact.\nThis is an huge workaround, by the\n  way. I guess that this annoying bug\n  should be fixed somewhere!\n\n\nIt worked for me in several laptops with stereo and/or mono built in microphone (on screen or panel).\nAdditionally, you may wish to take a look at your sound preferences, mentioned in the same page. Click this link: Skype doesn't find my audio input (this will lead you to a different answer in the same page).\nAlso posted here for your convenience:\n\nUnder Sound Preferences, please post\n  the \"Hardware Tab\" in order to check\n  your profile, which should use at\n  least an output + an input being in\n  use. Otherwise, your hardware is not\n  using the input profile which can be\n  chosen right there.\nThis answer may be changed after your\n  posting in order to give you further\n  details. Here is a sample. Thank you.\n\n\n\nEdit\n  -- Here is the conversation in the general chat room.\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: As suggested by the comments: make sure that you have set the microphone as input sound device in the sound preferences.\n\n\n*\n\n*To open the sound preferences, click on the sound indicator applet in the top right corner:\n\n\n*Then select the Input tab:\n\nMake sure that the input device isn't muted (checkbox), and that you've selected your microphone from the list of devices in the lower part of the window (not shown here).\n\n\nIf the microphone still won't work, make sure it's enabled in the BIOS setup and that you haven't turned it off via some Fn-shortcuts of your notebook.\n\nA: This could be a regression bug that I reported in 2009 and has not yet been solved. I asked a the same question before here and here. I didn't find any solution. I wonder if you have the same Intel 82801H sound card. \nI had to buy an external USB mic. \n\nA: I gave up on built in microphones. When I use skype or other type programs I use a bluetooth headset that I also use with my cell phone. If your laptop does not have bluetooth you can add a USB bluetooth dongle. You can find them for a cost from $15 to $30. They are tiny so it can be left plugged in all the time. Most headsets have a technology called multipoint which allows you to pair with more than one device simultaneously. When I need to make a skype call I press the call button on the headset and it connects to the bluetooth service on my computer and takes over the speaker and mic feature. Since it is basically wireless headset I can walk away from the computer while still in the call.\nI know this does not specifically answer your original question but may give you a better option.\n", "Q: What will be the default set of package management tools in future versions of Ubuntu? With the introduction of Ubuntu Software Centre, I remember reading, though I can't find any reliable source right now, that the various package managers were going to eventually be deprecated. Indeed, Gdebi is no longer a part of the default installation, and I heard that Synaptic was scheduled to the removed in the near future.\nBut what about the command line tools? These are far more efficient than the Ubuntu Software Center if you know what package name you're after. Will they continue to exist as standalone apps, or will they be rolled into Ubuntu Software Center in some way, becoming it's command line interface?\n\nA: The Software Centre is a graphical application. As it stands at present there would be very little point in effort being put into a CLI version of the Software Centre when polished alternatives exist.\nIt is certainly possible Synaptic will be removed from a default install in the next few cycles.\nNote that it was decided not to merge the Update Manager into the Software Centre.\n\nA: Apt and Dpkg are not going anywhere, they are here to stay: all of the applications you listed use them on the back end. \nYou should think of GUI and shell interfaces as related but independent - often a GUI uses the shell commands as a backend - for example, we added a Landscape control panel in 12.04, but left landscape-config unchanged.\n", "Q: How to avoid problems when installing Ubuntu and Windows 7 in dual-boot? I want to try out Ubuntu (and hopefully choose it as my primary OS). After looking at many versions of it in VirtualBox and from Live CD, I've finally decided to install it.\nSo I defragmented and shrinked one of the partitions to make room for Ubuntu.\nMy current setup (after shrinking the D: partition):\n[·100 MB·] [······250000 MB······] [·······600000 MB·······] [··100000 MB···]\n Reserved   Windows 7 system (C:)          Data (D:)            Free space\n   NTFS             NTFS                     NTFS              (for Ubuntu)\n\nThe Internet (including AskUbuntu) is full of scary stories about Windows not loading after installation of Ubuntu, something about installing GRUB to a wrong partition, etc.\nAs I am a newbie to Linux and Ubuntu, it is very easy for me to do something wrong. Please mention the problems that may appear and explain how to avoid them.\nUbuntu version that will be installed: 10.10 Desktop amd64  \nPlease note that I have installed Windows 7 about a year ago, so I have much to lose if something goes wrong. I want to be very careful because there is no way for me to backup all the data.\n\nA: Most of the scare your read about comes from an unlucky installation message from Grub that misled users to install Grub to their Windows partition boot sectors thus making Windows unbootable. As this is fixed now there is only a small risk left. \nIf you take care not to touch your Windows partitions when installing Ubuntu, and if you follow the standard installation process provided with Ubuntu you are on the safe side.\nAs always when installing a new OS or changing partitions backing up your data is absolutely necessary. I'm sure you have done that already.\nFor deeper insights into dual-boot setups read the Community Wiki.\n\nA: Backing up your data is essential.  It looks like you have a separate data partition so that will facilitate the task.  If the worst were to happen you could always restore Windows 7 from your original installation disk, and re-install all of your applications.  Time consuming, but feasible.  \nHowever, there is a way to backup your complete system, either the entire hard disk or each of the partitions in their \"pre-install\" condition.  You would need to use disk imaging software and store the resulting disk images on a separate storage medium, e.g. an external USB drive (since you don't have a second internal drive).  Then if your Ubuntu installation really went south, you could just restore the disk image and be back to your current system state in minutes - rather than in (many) hours.\nHowever, your initial work to set up the disk with lots of free space to hold Ubuntu should result in a completely trouble free operation and a working, dual-boot system.\nOne potential issue that might - but probably won't (because you will like Ubuntu so much, you won't want to remove it) - occur is if you subsequently decided to dump Ubuntu and delete the partition.  The chances are that you would eliminate the GRUB2 boot code and, since this will have essentially over-written the Windows' master boot record (MBR), your machine then would not boot.  However, the fixes to such problems have been well described in a more recent post here on AskUbuntu.  See: \"How do I restore Grub after Windows has deleted it?\" and the link provided by B. Roland to a tutorial on how to recover \"unbootable\" systems (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1014708).\nBut, as noted, your Ubuntu installation and dual-boot setup should go flawlessly.      \n\nA: From your description of your current set up, it seems as though C: and D: are on two separate drives. If this is correct, you can significantly enhance your safety by disconnecting the system drive before attempting to install; although this will prevent GRUB from finding the Windows installation. This is easily remedied, however.\nWhen you finish installing, reconnect your drive and set the BIOS to boot from the second one (which will now have GRUB installed). Boot into Ubuntu, and open a terminal to run sudo update-grub and it will recognize your Windows installation.\nYou should then verify that /etc/default/grub (the GRUB configuration file) has GRUB_TIMEOUT set to something over 0 so you will see the boot menu. To open this file in a text editor (and edit it, if necessary), run gksu gedit /etc/default/grub. If you edited it, save the file and then run sudo update-grub again.\nAlso, be sure that when you reach the phase of the installation where you are asked for a partitioning scheme you are absolutely certain of what you are telling Ubuntu to do. It will default to utilizing the entire disk, so be cautious. Otherwise, everything should be just hunky dory! If you run into any trouble, feel free to ask questions here. We'd love to see you become a member of our community!\n\nA: Actually this is not an answer. I think answer is given above. I will just try to explain why this occurs. \nEvery hard disk has a special tiny sector called Master Boot Record, which holds the boot information. When your PC boots, BIOS uses this information to boot the correct OS. Every Os installed on that hard disk must have an entry in MBR. For any linux distribution, they just write their entry alongside of other entries of OS, it's fair play. But for Windows, it totally erases all other entries in MBR except entries for windows OS (XP, Vista). So if you install ubuntu after windows, it will not erase other entries in MBR. So no problem occurs. But for windows, it erases all other entries. That's why, after installing windows you will never get your ubuntu (unless you fix it). \nFor your case, you explicitly told the ubuntu installer to install ubuntu on the drive on which windows is located. As previous answers mentioned, just be careful when you chose the partition to install ubuntu\n", "Q: Is My Filesystem Corrupt or Something?

Is there any known problems with PCI-E based SSD disks in Ubuntu (this, for instance)? Or should I prefer SSD disk with SATA interface to achieve maximum compatibility with Ubuntu OS? I use Ubuntu Server 8.04 now, but I'm ready to upgrade to 10.10 if necessary.\n\nA: There are indeed some PCI Express SSDs that don't work well, but most of them do. They are basically a RAID controller with discs on one card you see, so same as with raid controllers: The more expensive ones generally work, the cheaper one's may not work perfectly.\nYou should therefore make sure you can give it back should it not work.\nThe one you linked, the OCZ RevoDrive, is known to work.\n\nA: I would strongly recommend you upgrade to 10.10.\nI don't own an SSD myself, but I have heard much talk about the 'TRIM' function, support for which was only relatively recently added to the Linux kernel  in version 2.6.33. \nUbuntu 10.10 contains version 2.6.35 of the kernel (10.04 contains 2.6.32 & 8.04 contains only 2.6.24).\n", "Q: Get root privileges for nautilus on sftp connection I use \"Connect to server\" option to sftp to remote computers, as a user which has sudoer privileges. But then, I cannot get root privileges to modify system files. How can I do this?\n(I know i can use ssh and then use sudo, but I was wondering if there's a quicker method.)\n\nA: Hya, bad news for you. The short answer is that you can't — you get the privileges of the user you logged in as.\nThe long answer follows herewith… The 'connect to server' option is nothing but a pretty gui that issues simple sftp commands under the hood, once connected to a server via an ssh like transport protocol. A list of these commands is available if you enter a terminal window and enter man sftp. You'll see the commands available to 'connect to server' in the section 'interactive commands' of the manpage.\nThey are limited to bye cd chgrp chmod chown df exit get help lcd lls lmkdir ln lpwd ls lumask mkdir progress put pwd quite rename rm rmdir symlink and !. You may recognise many of them from ftp, if you ever command-line ftp'd. Some new cool additions, but as you can see none of them supports the concept of RunAs, or sudo. \nGaining elevated privileges was simply never designed into the protocol.\n", "Q: Which kernel to use for server VM running on ESX We run several ubuntu virtual machines on ESX server. \nIn ubuntu, there are various kernels available:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-generic-pae\n\n*linux-generic\n\n*linux-server\n\n*linux-virtual\n\n\nWhich one is the best choise for a virtual machine running on ESX?\n\nA: Let's try to explain the main differences between the kernels that you listed:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-generic: This is the normal Ubuntu kernel. The one that the distro uses as default.\n\n*linux-generic-pae: This is the generic kernel with PAE enabled. It will let you use 4 Gb of RAM or more in a 32bit system. You don't want it if your using 64 bits or if you have less than 4Gb of RAM, as it has a small performance penalty.\n\n*linux-server: This is a kernel optimised for server use. This article has good info on the most important changes. They are over 50 configuration options changed. A gross approximation will be that this kernel will favor long background processes over interactive ones. It will not hesitate to freeze your mouse to give more power to your database number crunching or a file-write.\n\n*linux-virtual: This is the server kernel, with most drivers stripped. It only has the drivers needed to run as a guest in the most popular virtual machines like KVM, Xen, and VMWare. Source.\nSo there is no clear answer to your question, it all depends on the use of the virtual machines. If they are going to be traditional servers (not terminal servers) and you are never going to move them to real hardware, linux-virtual seems the best option.\n\nA: But unfortunately no kernel modules (ip_tables) are loaded with linux-virtual kernel so no csf firewal \"out of the box\" for example.\n", "Q: Utility/Sniffer to track internet traffic/speed of all PCs in local network It doesn't matter if utility is for Ubuntu or for Windows XP/7, just need to see what pc is using the most traffic in local network.\nProbably some spammer etc on that pc.\nNeed to get rid of that, before calling to my ISP.\n\nA: Wireshark will work if you can span a gateway connection in order to see all the PCs traffic.  Otherwise, you'll only see your own.\nIf your PCs support SNMP, I think your best bet will be a tool like Cacti.  This way you run Cacti on a central PC/server, which then polls the other PCs for interface information and graphs the resulting interfaces for comparison.\n\n\nA: Wireshark is the superb tool for doing this. And HERE is the list of all the tools you'l ever need, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*BWM - BandWidth Monitor\n\n*port scanner\n\n*A tool to send magic Wake-on-LAN packets\n\n*script that quickly measures network device throughput\n\n*etc...\n\n\nI also found a lot of bandwidth monitoring tools for Linux HERE.\n\nA: +1 on wireshark that really is a wonderful tool (and @Beck you can use Statistics -> Conversations or Statistics-> Endpoints to get a summary of traffic).\nYou may also find Etherape to be useful. That gives you a realtime graphical representation of where most traffic is coming/going from.\nHowever do bear in mind that whichever tool you use to measure the traffic you will likely need to measure it from your gateway/router because any one individual machine will not see the traffic for the rest of the network due to network switching and various other factors. If you don't have a graphical interface on your gateway machine you could grab a packet dump using tcpdump or tshark\n\nA: Iptraf is a great tool for monitoring LAN Traffic as well as individual traffic,\nThe tool is handy and could be viewed form terminal itself.\nFor advanced monitoring i suggest wireshark\n", "Q: How do I make my intous 4 wacom affect only one Monitor? I have two monitors and I want my wacom to only work on one monitor.\n\nA: That's not currently possible with Ubuntu. You'd need to program xorg to focus one core pointer towards one specific screen and I don't know of any way that's possible.\nYou could however suggest it as a feature for xorg by reporting a bug:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs\nI suspect that you may be using an nvidia card, if this is the case then you are using twinview which distorts the dimensions of the desktop (because it's fake, it's one desktop over two displays, instead of two desktops like ATI and Intel), to set this up just use xsetwacom:\nxsetwacom --list\n\nThis will tell you the names of your pen device, then use that in the next command:\nxsetwacom --set \"Wacom Intuos3 4x6 stylus\" TwinView horizontal\n\nTo put it back to normal, use:\nxsetwacom --set \"Wacom Intuos3 4x6 stylus\" TwinView none\n\nYou should need to set stylus, eraser and pointer to get all your devices set right. Once you can see how it works, copy and paste the commands into a new hidden file called .xinitrc in your home folder, you can use a normal text editor to make the file.\nNow you should have good wacom settings when you reboot. (side note: you can use xsetwacom --list param to get a list of all the options you can set.)\n", "Q: Dialing into multiple PPP connections I have multiple 3G USB based Modems. I would like them to keep connected simultaneously, NOT necessarily aggregating their bandwidth; a separate intelligent application would manage their utilization effectively.\nHowever I am running into problem of setting up proper routes for the ppp0,ppp1 interfaces: when one of them connects, other's entries in the routing table get updated so it is no more usable. If I reconnect the second one, it would override the first one's routing entries. If I do it over and over, sometimes both of them's entries disappear while in rare cases the two work well.\nI have tried it both using NetworkManager as well as WVDial but issue pops up in both of these. Perhaps both of them use same PPP dialer at the backend and thats why this issue appears. \nWhat is the proper solution to make them work together? In the long run, I'd also like them to automatically dial in once USB gets connected.\n\nA: You may wish to try configuring your mobile connections with a simple tweak: checking the Use this connection only for the resources on its network checkbox, which is hidden a little far unfortunately:\nUnder the settings for your connection, go to the IPv4 tab, click the Routes button, then check the last checkbox on that dialog.\nNot tested, but roughly, what should be happening is each pppX device should be getting enabled with correct routes through each of your providers' networks, but the default route should not get set to pass over any of them.\nYou should then be able to write a simple script that, for instance, pings the same server from each of the interfaces and chooses the fastest one to set the default route; something like:\nroute_candidate=$(\nfor iface in `ifconfig -a | grep ppp | awk '{print $1; }'`; do\n    echo $iface = `ping -I $iface -c 1 -q 8.8.8.8 | grep avg | awk -F/ '{print $5;}'`\ndone | sort -k 3 -rn | head -n 1\n)\n\nlogger \"Setting new route from candidate: $route_candidate\"\n\nip route del default\nip route add default dev `echo $route_candidate | awk '{print $1;}'`\n\nI didn't test this completely, but it's roughly what needs to be done; with the addition or modification of using \"via whatever_the_default_gw_ip_is\" for the ip route add default command. Run this with cron on a regular interval and you have a cheapo system for staying on the \"fastest\" ISP.\n\nA: I'm having problems connecting to multiple dongles too.

I've also done a couple of complete rebuilds - so it doesn't appear to be a preference/option being stuck somewhere.\nAnyone have any clue how to get this functionality enabled?\n\nA: I'm going to take a guess and suppose you were using metacity on the older system, and are now using compiz.\nCompiz works a bit differently with the GNOME-panel, and you can't drag the applications on the panel to a new workspace. You can however, drag the application by the title bar and move it to the edge of the screen. This will cause the window to change to the next workspace (so long as you have the advanced effects enabled in appearance properties).\nLeave me a comment if you need more detail.\nEDIT:\nYou will also need compiz config to enable dragging windows across desktops.\nDesktop wall (or cube if you like) provide the option.

After installing Ubuntu on my ThinkPad T510, the GDM screen and GNOME session would always start at 100% brightness.\nI quickly found out, that this can be controlled via gnome-power-preferences, but I'd like to have GDM and the GNOME session follow the global backlight setting (ie., when I set it during POST, GRUB, GDM, a GNOME session, or on a TTY, I expect it not to automatically change).\nSo, how can I make gnome-power-manager stop automatically changing my backlight level?\n\nA: It seems this can only be disabled by editing a gconf setting using gconf-editor or the command line tool gconftool-2 (easier). As GDM is run by a special user (gdm), you got to disable it for the desktop user and that special user:\nRun the following from a gnome-terminal:\ngconftool-2 --set --type boolean  \"/apps/gnome-power-manager/backlight/enable\" false\n\nThis will deactivate the backlight control for your user.

I have an extra ext4 formatted partition which I would like to ecrypt with ecryptfs. I have chosen not to go for home directory ecryption and having a encrypted private directory also hasn't helped me. \nSo, the remaining option for me is to encrypt the extra partition. So, I want to know what is the best way to achieve this. The drive should get mounted when I log in. And I should be able to move my Documents and other important folders in the home directory to the encrypted drive, and symlink them back to the home directory. As I save some passwords in firefox, should I move the hidden firefox folder in the home directory to the encrypted drive? \n\nA: Probably the simplest way to do this is to use an \"Encrypted Private\" directory. This will make ~/Private encrypted, and you can move trees into there and symlink to them (for firefox, etc). It is very easy to set up:\nsudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils\necryptfs-setup-private\n\nNow just log out of your session and back in, and you'll have an encrypted ~/Private directory automounted. You can move things into it like this:\ncd ~\nmv .mozilla Private/\nln -s Private/.mozilla .\n\nFor more details, see \"man ecryptfs-setup-private\", or read the manpage online\n\nA: You should know that if a person has physical access to the machine, there is little thing you can do to prevent deletion or other evil actions, be it a directory or a partition: they can still boot with a CD if you put \"passwords-everywhere\".\nFor directories, you can also use encFS which is very nice.\nFor partition, if you want deniability (eg. possibility to deny it is no more than a spare partition), the only option you have is TrueCrypt. But if you automount it you'll loose deniability as a script can be found that mounts this partition.\nSo, to really \"hide\", you have to mount manually.\n", "Q: How can I get rid off this slight red border in Progress-GUI?

(While this is possible, often it's better to start from scratch when reporting a bug rather than start with a question, so if someone on Launchpad asks you to report a bug, that's what you should do.)\nQuestions in any language are supported in Launchpad Answers (you select what language you're asking the question in), even though bug reports should only be filed in English. This is particularly relevant to Ubuntu+1 because it means:\n\n*\n\n*You can use Launchpad Answers to work on bugs that are specific to your language or region, without knowing or feeling comfortable writing and reading English.\n\n\n*You can use Launchpad Answers to ask for help translating text from your language into English, so you can report a bug in English. (Or ask for help making changes to a bug report you've previously made in English.)\nJust as it's a good idea to look at the FAQ before using AskUbuntu, it's suggested to read the guide (it's very short!), or at least the part on asking questions, before posting a question on Launchpad Answers.\n\nA: General Alpha Information\nIf you've been redirected here you've probably asked a question about an Alpha or Beta release of Ubuntu.\nGenerally speaking we don't take questions about running or using unreleased versions of Ubuntu releases here since development releases change almost by the hour and usually it's broken and alpha testers are expected to give direct feedback to the developers via the bug tracker so that these issues can be fixed for everyone.\nIt's not that we don't care, we just wouldn't be good at it and one of the main purposes of the site is to create a reusable resource for users, which would be hard if we had a bunch of questions about something that quickly became out of date!\nThe answers in this question will help you get started, good luck, and thanks for testing!\nFile bugs\nYou should file bugs for the relevant package that you are having problems with. Bugs are one of the main advantages of having developer releases - they provide valuable information to the developers and help them to improve the software.\nHow do I report a bug?\nIf you are unsure which package to file the bug against, please use the other resources (forums, mailing lists etc.) to ask which package you should file it against.\nDebugging Information will help you file bugs.\n\nA: Have fun learning!\nThe examples here use one branch in quantal. Feel free to change as necessary.\nWhen you see a bug and report it, you can get valuable feedback, especially from developers. You can also try to get a start in programming by submitting a patch. First, you must figure out the source package the bug is related to(related package). It will show up as a name such as linux-meta-ti-omap4, or another package name. You can then visit https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta-ti-omap4, replacing the package name as needed.\nOnce there, you should pick the correct branch, usually something like lp:ubuntu/[version-in-development]-proposed/linux-meta-ti-omap4(Note the [version-in-development] part should be the version currently in alpha, or beta.\nNow, it's time to get the branch:\nFirst, you'll want bzr:\nsudo apt-get install bzr\n\nand you'll want an SSH key(you can skip this if your SSH keys are already on Launchpad):\n\n*\n\n*Open up 'Passwords and Keys' by searching from the dash.\n\n\n*Create a new SSH key, with possibly a password. Make sure it is SSHv2 if there is an option for that, and use RSA.\n\n\n*Right-click it in the list once created, and export it to a file of your choice.\n\n\n*Open the file with Gedit, and copy the text, including the short line on top with info about the key.\n\n\n*Paste this into the box at the bottom of the page here, and submit the form.\n\n\n*You can now connect with BZR. Open a command-line, and create a new directory and change to it:\n mkdir directory-name-of-your-choice&&cd directory-name-of-your-choice\n\n\n\n*Perform the following:\n bzr launchpad-login [launchpad userid]\n\n\n\n*You can now get the branch with:\n  bzr branch lp:ubuntu/quantal-proposed/linux-meta-ti-omap4 \n\nchanging the branch name as necessary. This is for quantal, but the branch name will change as stated previously.\n\n\n*If you think the branch has been changed by the devs, you can always use bzr pull when in the folder you branched to.\n\n\n*Make your changes using any program of your choice(excluding .po files as those are dynamically generated), and if the problem involves UI text, be sure to change the correct .pot files.\n\n\n*Every time you want to make a checkpoint, use:\nbzr commit -m \"a descriptive message about your changes\"\n\n\n\n*After finishing work, push the branch with:\nbzr push lp:~[your userid]/project-name/branch-name\n\nin this example case, it will be\n bzr push lp:~[your userid]/ubuntu/quantal-proposed/linux-meta-ti-omap4\n\nOnce you are done, visit the bug, and click the \"Link to a related branch\" at the right. Paste the branch you created, without the lp: part:\n~[your userid]/ubuntu/quantal-proposed/linux-meta-ti-omap4\n\nin this example. The branch will be merged if the devs like it, or it will be improved upon. It can also be rejected if the problem can be solved more cleanly, your changes do not solve the problem, or if the problem has been solved already, in another branch.\n\nA: Forums\n\n*\n\n*If your question on Ask Ubuntu was linked to this answer then this is where you should  probably go to repost your problem.\n\nThe Ubuntu Forums' Development & Programming section is a good place to start. The precise subforum depends on the release, but at the moment you want the Ubuntu Development Version.\nTake a look through the recent threads and see if anything looks like the problem you are experiencing. If it doesn't you should create a new thread detailing your experiences.\n\nA: Before an upgrade, always test\nsudo apt-get --simulate dist-upgrade\n\nIf you get an error about broken packages, don't upgrade.\n\nA: IRC (Internet Relay Chat)\n\n*\n\n*#ubuntu+1 on irc.freenode.net\n\n*#ubuntu-bugs if helping report/triage bugs\n\n\nA: ubuntu-devel-announce mailing list\nWhen large changes are being made usually a developer will post on the ubuntu-devel-announce list. This list doesn't get many posts (compared to some of the other Ubuntu lists!) so for pre-release testers there is no excuse not be subscribed to it.\n\nA: Keep an eye on package uploads\nUploads to the archive are sent to a mailing list, named after the animal nickname, for example lucid-changes, utopic-changes, etc. Following this list can be useful to see when risky uploads are being uploaded so you can hopefully avoid problems before it's too late.\nAlso the Archive Status tool is useful for showing the status of the archive before you upgrade.\n\nA: Fixing your problems\n\n*\n\n*General Problems\n\n*Specific Problems\n", "Q: How to prevent updating of a specific package? Because of bug #693758 I'd like to prevent apt-get upgrade and Update Manager from updating the \"libgtk2.0-0\" package. \nHow can this be achieved?\n\nA: Holding\nThere are different ways of holding back packages: with dpkg, apt, dselect, aptitude or Synaptic.\ndpkg\nPut a package on hold:\necho \"<package-name> hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nRemove the hold:\necho \"<package-name> install\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nDisplay the status of all your packages:\ndpkg --get-selections\n\nDisplay the status of a single package:\ndpkg --get-selections <package-name>\n\nShow all packages on hold:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep \"\\<hold$\"\n\napt\nHold a package:\nsudo apt-mark hold <package-name>\n\nRemove the hold:\nsudo apt-mark unhold <package-name>\n\nShow all packages on hold:\nsudo apt-mark showhold\n\ndselect\nWith dselect, enter the [S]elect screen, find the package you wish to hold in its present state and press = or H. The changes will take effect immediately after exiting the [S]elect screen.\n\nThe following approaches are limited in that locking/holding a package within aptitude or synaptic doesn't affect apt-get/apt.\naptitude\nHold a package:\nsudo aptitude hold <package-name>\n\nRemove the hold:\nsudo aptitude unhold <package-name>\n\nLocking with Synaptic Package Manager\nGo to Synaptic Package Manager (System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager).\nClick the search button and type the package name.\nWhen you find the package, select it and go to the Package menu and select Lock Version.\n\nThat package will now not show in the update manager and will not be updated.\n\nA: Everything you ever wanted to know about \"holding\" and \"pinning\" packages to specific versions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto\n\nA: I was looking for the same thing and after a lot of research I found that using the following syntax you can forbid one specific version but allow the next update:\nPackage: compiz-plugins-main\nPin: version 1:0.9.7.0~bzr19-0ubuntu10.1\nPin-Priority: -1\n\nThis goes into the /etc/apt/preferences file.\n\nA: To put a package \"foo\" on hold:\necho \"foo hold\" | dpkg --set-selections\n\nIn your case we are going to put wine on hold:\nsudo -i\necho \"wine hold\" | dpkg --set-selections\n\nTo remove the hold:\nsudo -i\necho \"wine install\" | dpkg --set-selections\n\n\nA: I synaptic you can freeze the version of a specific package I'm not a 100% sure as to whether this will amend apt-get but it will definately stop update manager.\nTo freeze a package select it in synaptic then open the package menu and select freeze version.\nHope this helps\nedit: This question 16668 deals with a similar situation\n\nA: Adding details to @soger's comments relative to Ubuntu 16.04.\nUbuntu 16.04 does not have an existing /etc/apt/preferences file by default. If you don't have one currently, just create a new file and populate it with a stanza as @soger describes above to exclude the given package and its dependencies from updates.\nAfterwards, run apt update and you're GTG. :0)\nFor example, I have an Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS server with embedded Intel video card and an NVidia card. The NVidia card is the only one used. The server also uses CUDA drivers. I had a problem where apt kept insisting \n\nva-driver-all\n\n(Intel drivers) required an update, but it could not determine which version to install. This was driving me nuts, and I didn't need the Intel drivers anyway. I entered this text into the preferences file and flushed apt, problem solved.\nPackage: va-driver-all\nPin: release *\nPin-Priority: -1\n\n\nA: See bugs #75332, #158981 and #72806.\nThe summary is that hold at apt-get / aptitude level is not triggering hold status in dpkg (see bug 72806 especially) and update-manager reads status from dpkg.\nworkaround is run as root:\necho \"package hold\" | dpkg --set-selections\n\nA: Install synaptic using sudo apt-get install synaptic.\nRun using gksudo synaptic and on the search box locate the package you want to lock, ie: gedit\n\nFrom the package menu select Lock version:\n\nAnd that is all, the version currently installed at the time of the lock will stay installed even during upgrades.\n\nA: You can use on aptitude the \"specific override\", like this:\naptitude reinstall ~i oracle-java8-jre:\n\nThis is a one time only use of (not stored for future reinstalls), keep specific override, to reinstall all packages in your system but not oracle-java8-jre.\nIf you use a keep specific override, the package will momentarily be in a state of keep and aptitude will not try to install it.\nA very good thing if you think your system was compromised some how as you can reinstall everything in just one punch card.\n\nA: Just because it was not mentioned here, the KDE tool Muon has an option similar to Synaptic's:\n\n\n\nA: Preventing a package from being installed is called \"package holding\" and it is very simple to do:\n\necho package_name hold | dpkg --set-selections\n\n...where *package_name* is the name of the package you want to prevent from installation.\nNote: the above command assumes root privileges. In other words, you will probably need to type sudo su before running it.\n\nA: Since some time apt-get is replaced by apt, so for example I want to prevent Firefox from updating to version above 56, because a lot of add-ons, like \"Tab Groups\" don't work any more with the new Firefox 57 (see \"WebExtensions Update\").\nIt is possible to hold more than one packages with one command and use wildcards.\nPrevent Firefox from updating\nsudo apt-mark hold firefox firefox-locale-*\n\nIf you should deside to unhold them later, that would be the command:\nsudo apt-mark unhold firefox firefox-locale-*\n\n\nA: If you have Synaptic installed you can select the package and use the menu Package -> Lock Version to prevent it being updated.\nYou can install Synaptic with sudo apt-get install synaptic. I personally find it more useful than the Software Center... then again, I'm fairly old school. :)\n\nA: Occasionally one might want to hold back all the packages currently installed.  Here's how.\nFirst save the current state, so you can undo:\ndpkg --get-selections > current_selections.txt\n\nThen, to hold back all the packages:\ndpkg --get-selections | sed -r \"s/\\tinstall/hold/\" |dpkg --set-selections\n\nFinally, when you want to revert back to the previous state:\ndpkg --set-selections < current_selections.txt\n\nOne use case for this might be when creating a VM or Amazon AMI snapshot to migrate from a QA to production environment.\n\nA: To keep a package at the currently-installed version and prevent it from being automatically upgraded, you can add an APT preference fragment to /etc/apt/preferences.d like this:\nPackage: vim\nPin: release a=now\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\n", "Q: How do I get the skype panel icon back? i m a less that 10 hours user of ubuntu 10.10. i have installed skype.the first time i installed it there was a green icon on the panel with my status but i closed it by wrong.any idea how to return it?thanks\n\nA: Go to to panel --> notification area.\n\nA: To access skype,\n\n\n*\n\n*Goto Applications>>Internet>>Skype\n\n", "Q: Lenovo ThinkPad T400 and docking station Developer in me woke up this morning and asked me to fix this before Christmas. (As his Christmas gift).\nSo, if I power on the laptop after docking it, everything works fine. But if I am working on it standalone and then try to dock it, I cannot get the display. Same way, if I undock it while working, I loose the display. \nBasically, I need to reboot for any docking/undocking dance to work. \nQuestions:\n1) What kind of information should I be looking for to understand the problem? \n2) Where to find that information. \nAfter this, I can go and try to figure out what is going wrong.\n\nA: I have a similar experience with T400 and dock station (ThinkPad Port Advanced Mini Dock). I'm using Fedora 14 and the Intel graphics (Radeon switched off in BIOS, as both the proprietary and open the driver has issues in dual screen mode).\nWhen I undock with the laptop running, usually the laptop is still usable. The later dock-in operation is not 100% successful, e.g. the usb mouse connected to the docking station is no more working till the next re-boot.\nTo be honest, I'd be happy if I could at least suspend to disk - undock - resume - suspend to disk - dock in - resume, but this cycle has just about 30-50% success - which is a real pain. So result is that unplugging few more cables is much faster then waiting for re-boot and opening all the docs closed before the shutdown :-(\nConcerning the hot undock-dock, I have tried the howto on \nhttp://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Docking_Solutions\nThe shell script works well, after some customization, but udev rule\n/etc/udev/rules.d/81-thinkpad-dock.rules\nKERNEL==\"dock.0\", ACTION==\"change\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/sbin/thinkpad-dock.sh\"\n\ndoes not trigger it.\n\nA: Hiya, from my own experience in any additions to computers I would personally save all my work and shut down the computer to ensure all your hard work is saved and will not be affected.  Unlock your computer and eject from the docking station. Once fully ejected you can then restart your computer in the normal waysafe in the knowing that nothing will be damaged or lost.  I would always use this procedure also when placing back into the dock.  Shut down first, connect to the dock and then restart.\nFor more information check out http://www.squidoo.com/thinkpad-dock-and-docking-stations\n\nA: The T400 has switchable graphics, meaning it has a choice of two different GPUs (Intel and Radeon). You can force it to only use the Radeon from the BIOS settings by selecting \"Discrete Graphics\".\nOnly the Radeon is physically connected to the docking port.\nhttp://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Switchable_Graphics\n", "Q: how to install the greasemonkey in google chrome / opera / midori? anyidea how to install its on its ? in google chrome / opera / midori ? \n\nA: Within Google Chrome you don't need to install a Greasemonkey extension as you do on Firefox, but if you click on a Greasemonkey script you will automatically have the option to install it.\n", "Q: Problems trying to move my /home partition I was running low in disk space on my Linux box, Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop, (specifically on my /home partition) so I added another disk to it and I am trying to move the home partition into it.\nI am trying to follow the steps on this guide here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\nHowever, when copying the files over to the new mounted partition rsync seems to fail silently.

Clients can drive up X RAM or CPU usage by making excessive calls to the xserver, sort of like a DDOS attack against a web server.\nThe standard way to debug this kind of issue is to look through your process list (e.g. 'ps aux') and start killing off applications one by one until the load dissipates.  Whatever you killed last is probably what's to blame.\nThe program xrestop can give some indication of what clients are using resources, however unfortunately the memory column in that report doesn't give total memory usage, just pixmap memory.

The only option I saw for this with ffmpeg was force_key_frames but it seems I'd have to set each time explicitly.\nI'd specifically like this to work with Totem.

I'm only having trouble with these videos that I'm creating from images.\nThe basic encoding commands I'm using are:\nmencoder \"mf://image.jpg\" -mf w=480:h=360:type=jpg -o mencoder_out.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:aspect=4/3:keyint=30 -audiofile music.mp3 -oac copy -fps 1/300.0 -ofps 30 -idx\n\nand\nffmpeg -i image.jpg -i music.mp3 -acodec copy ffmpeg_out.avi\n\nWith mencoder I've also tried using a separate pass to add the key frames:\nmencoder -idx mencoder_out.avi -o mencoder_indexed.avi -ovc copy -oac copy\n\n\n\n*\n\n*note: with mencoder I usually add other lavcopts like vbitrate and mbd but none of those have had any effect on this problem as far as I can tell\n\n\nA: I figured it out for ffmpeg. I added -f image as an input option for the image like so:\n-f image2 -i image.jpg\n\nI found the answer indirectly on superuser and his tip for -loop_input -shortest helped me a lot too.\n", "Q: Can I use apt-get or aptitude to install software to non standard location? When I install a software using apt-get it installs to default locations i.e to /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/share and etc. For example when I install \"Meld Diff Viewer\" using\nsudo apt-get install meld\n\nand use whereis command to find its location, I get the following output\nadnan@adnan-laptop:~$ whereis meld\nmeld: /usr/bin/meld /usr/lib/meld /usr/share/meld /usr/share/man/man1/meld.1.gz\n\nIs there any way to change the install location. Lets say if I want to install it in /usr/local/ can I do it using apt-get or aptitude? I know I can compile it from source and specify prefix option to configure script or make install but it would be better (and really easier) if I could do it using apt-get as I would be able to use uninstall, upgrade and other stuff that apt-get offers\n\nA: Most programs are looking for files they need (like config files, GUI ressources, ...) on a few hardcoded places and will refuse to works if those files aren't there. To change this places you usually need to recompile the programs (but sometimes you can use command line options or environment variables instead).\ndpkg and apt offer a way to change the install location (as far as I remember it's --root= with dpkg and Dir::Root in the apt config - but check the docs if you really need it).  This is so you can mount another systems's root dir on your system and install packages on it (like if you have diskless systems mounting their root via NFS from a server).\n\nA: For what i know the directories where it will install the desire software is inside the  .deb package. If you need to change that, you need to change the package altogether. This is because the way to install and where to install it must be a standard between packages originating from a deb package so no chaotic installs are made. The structure of the deb package, where each type of file goes to ensure the correct standardization of the software for debian based packages must be always the same. This way everyone knows where a certain package always installs the software it has inside the package. \n", "Q: Monitoring of Network We have around 300 machines.

For example, imagine yourself doing the following:\nlocal % ssh some.where.com\nremote % verylongscript.sh\n\nNow you realize that you need to go but don't want the script to be killed upon exiting, so you\nctrl-Z\nremote % bg\nremote % disown\nremote % exit\nlocal %\n\nNow, on remote, your script is still running.\n\nA: Use the nohup command like this:\nnohup gedit /home/user/file.txt &\n\n\nA: *\n\n*To put the application into the background, use &:\ncommand &\n\n\n*If you wish to close the terminal, and keep the application running, you can use several options: screen ,  dtach  and nohup.\nnohup command &\n\n\n*Screen is helpful as you can re-start a session and dtach is fun as well.\n\n*Look at the following links for more informations\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen  \n\n*Dtach\n\nA: I use\nnohup mycommand &\n\nFor example to bring up a VirtualBox virtual server I type the following in a remote shell (which I close then):\nnohup VBoxHeadless --startvm \"myvm\" --vrdp=off &\n\n", "Q: How to load a `zenity` List Dialog with space-embedded data from `ls`?

Although it ships with Xandros, one of the first things I did for her was remove it and install Ubuntu. She's had Ubuntu Netbook Remix on there for a while, but once Unity was enforced on everyone, the poor little netbook can't cope with it (the graphics performance is pretty hopeless).\nAfter swapping and changing a few times to get something she likes, I've installed Linux Mint 9. Unfortunately, the keyboard isn't mapped correctly and I can't find the correct driver to use for it. This means that some of the keys only work with the left shift key, some others only with the right shift key, and some others work with neither. In particular, she can't type an @ sign - which makes emailing people difficult!\nAny advice on how I can get the keyboard operating again would be very much appreciated by both of us!\n\nA: You should be able to switch to the regular graphic interface on the netbook remixed edition of Ubuntu, by selecting the proper environment at the login time. If you are setup for an automatic login, you can still logout and re-login with the proper credentials. The selection is done through some of the icons on the bottom of the desktop BEFORE logging in. This is how I got rid of the Unity environment, which is also giving me hard time on my Eee900 netbook. \nBecause of performance, I now use Jolicloud on my netbook. It is much faster, although the environment is not what I would personally prefer.

After I installed it, I have not been able to view subtitles after loading it. It appears as a rectangle in place of text.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The problem might be with the encoding of the subtitle file. Try opening the file and see if you can see the text in the text editor(you definitely should), if you don't, then get a different subtitle file.\nIf you are able to see, copy all text to clipboard, and save it in a new file as a plain text file with the extension \".srt\" and replace the original file. Lock and load!\nFor VLC to pick up the subtitles automatically, make sure that the video file and the srt file have the same name.\n\nA: Is it a single rectangle where the text should be or a series of letter sized rectangles? \nIf it is multiple rectangles then you probably are missing a font with the proper glyphs for the language you are trying to view. Look in Preferences ➔ Subtitles & OSD and report the Encoding and Font Selected.\nFor example if ဆဌဗရယမဝဪ appears as rectanlges and not the prettiest letterforms on the planet (Mayanmar) then you don't have Unicode support in your font. (I don't know Mayanmar so those are random glyphs, my apologies if they say something rude.)\n\nA: In my case I saw question marks instead of the real letters.

Did you try connecting any other devices? Sorry if this is a bit obvious.\n\nA: Is your PC a laptop? Is there a hardware button you must push/press or move over to turn on the wifi radio?\n\nA: Maybe there's conflict between two different drivers for the same hardware. I don't know about you wifi hardware, but if there's conflict you should blacklist one of the driver, adding \"blacklist nameofthedriver\" in the last line of this file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf .\n\nA: You could try the madwifi driver.

You can check that by trying to connect to an unencrypted/open wifi access point.\nI have an Atheros AR5212 in my laptop and I have been totally unable to connect to some specific wifi access point models. So, try to connect to two different models of unencrypted/open access points to make sure it's not specific to your available access point.\nYour link to the \"ath5k cannot recover\" bugs could be the cause, but I don't think Ubuntu uses madwifi by default?

How can I encrypt an external device (i.e. USB keys, external hard-drives, memory sticks, etc.) so that it would subsequently be readable/writable on any computer that I plug it in? \nFor instance, it should then be possible to easily plug the encrypted device on a Linux, Windows, or OS X machine, and be able to access the contents without any fuss. \nHow can I do that?\n\nA: I would use EncFS which is available for Linux, OS X and Windows. Advantage is that you can also use it with cloud storage since EncFS encrypts on filesystem level and therefore the changes only affect the files changed not a partition as a whole.\nOn Linux it's as easy as\nencfs ~/Dropbox/encrypted ~/Private\n\nI presume it's similar on Windows but I have only tested it between OSX and Linux so far. You can find a little more info here\nOn Linux Gnome Encfs Manager is a pretty handy GUI tool to manage EncFS encrypted directories, store passwords in keyring, etc.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gencfsm && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install gnome-encfs-manager\n\n\nA: You could also consider installing Truecrypt on your USB. Once installed, use TrueCrypt to  create an encrypted container, which can be opened with the software on the key. Saves you time installing software on multiple computers, still leaving you with the encryption you wanted.\n\nUpdate since 2014, from TrueCrypt site:\n\nWARNING: Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues\nThis page exists only to help migrate existing data encrypted by TrueCrypt.\nThe development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Microsoft terminated support of Windows XP.\n\n\nA: Truecrypt is probably your best choice, though you'll need to be able to install the software on any computer you want to use.\n\nUpdate since 2014, from TrueCrypt site:\n\nWARNING: Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues\nThis page exists only to help migrate existing data encrypted by TrueCrypt.\nThe development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Microsoft terminated support of Windows XP.\n\n\nA: There is DoxBox: \n\nOpen-Source disk encryption for Windows\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Easy to use, with a 'wizard' for creating new 'DoxBoxes'.\n  \n*Full transparent encryption, DoxBoxes appear as removable disks in Windows Explorer.\n  \n*Explorer mode lets you access DoxBoxes when you don't have admin permissions.\n  \n*Compatible with Linux encryption, Cryptoloop \"losetup\", dm-crypt, and LUKS. Linux shell scripts support deniable encryption on Linux.\n  \n*Supports smartcards and security tokens.\n  \n*Encrypted DoxBoxes can be a file, a partition, or a whole disk.\n  \n*Opens legacy volumes created with FreeOTFE\n  \n*Runs on Windows Vista onwards (see note below for 64 bit versions).\n  \n*Supports numerous hash (including SHA-512, RIPEMD-320, Tiger) and encryption algorithms (Including AES, Twofish, and Serpent) in several modes (CBC, LRW, and XTS), giving more options than any other disk encryption software.\n  \n*Optional 'key files' let you use a thumb-drive as a key.\n  \n*Portable mode doesn't need to be installed and leaves little trace on 3rd party PCs (administrator rights needed).\n  \n*Deniable encryption protects you from 'rubber hose cryptography'.\n  \n\nAfter open-source computer program FreeOTFE for on-the-fly disk encryption (OTFE) got discontinued, the DoxBox fork sprung up. \n\nThis means that you can encrypt a partition using LUKS (How to encrypt external devices?), and then access it from a Windows machine using DoxBox. \n\nA: I would suggest Kruptos 2 Pro encryption software if you want to use your files on Windows, Mac OS and Android. I would suggest Kruptos 2 Pro is best fit along with any cloud folder integration. Kruptos does support USB drive as well. You can use simply right click context menu.\n\nA: Use VeraCrypt it's been the default replacement to TrueCrypt.\n\nVeraCrypt is a free open source disk encryption software for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Brought to you by IDRIX (https://www.idrix.fr) and based on TrueCrypt 7.1a.\n\n\nA: The problem with free solutions is that apart from a few, most of them are usually not well maintained or well supported. You have to wait for compatibility updates and bugs resolutions. It is also better to go for container encryption than drive or disk encryption, specially for external drives, as they are more flexible and easier to manage. If you are willing to spend a little, I can suggest BestCrypt containers. They are supported on Windows, Linux, Mac and even Android with a number of algorithms. Instead of encrypting your USB, you can create a container the size of your USB, external hard drives etc. and access them on each platform. \n", "Q: Ubuntu version for browsing pages on low-end netbook I have AAO110 (512ram, atom 270N)\nWhat is best version of Ubuntu, if i need just web? UNR 10.04 was almost fine, but i wonder if there are better options now.\nbrowser, blue-tooth, WiFi, long battery, no extra elements on screen (e.g. not like in Unity) while browser opened\n\nA: I think that this guide might help you.\n\nA: I tested Ubuntu 10.10 on old PCs and Laptops. Including MINI ones. You can install the 10.10 netbook and even the desktop one in that PC with no problem via the Live USB. Of course if you install the desktop it will all look pretty small hehe. but it works great. Loads fast, no problems whatsoever with any of my clients.\nWith this said, you can test the Firefox 3.6 that comes with ubuntu 10.10 or download the chrome version for it. Both cases work good. Even on a 512mb machine.\n", "Q: Shared Folders in Virtualbox I have a Win7 box with an Ubuntu 10.10 VM accessed in Virtualbox.\nThe Ubuntu install has the ex4 filesystem.  Can I access the shared folders in both Windows and Ubuntu without corrupting the data?\nI made this mistake when dual-booting my laptop and made changes to a folder in Ubuntu.  When I tried accessing that data in Windows, the access time was very slow, basically about 10% of normal.  The only way I could fix it was to restore the data from backups and not make changes in Ubuntu.\nIf I do this with the shared folders, will the same thing happen?\n\nA: What you're reporting is very strange. I almost always use the same \"downloads\" and \"documents\" folders from both Windows and Ubuntu, and have never experienced slow downs from either OS. I have kept both of these directories on an external hard drive that is formatted as NTFS.\nAdditionally, I have used Ubuntu VMs from within Windows in the past, and still use a Windows VM from within Ubuntu, with shared folders on all of them, but never experienced any discrepancies in access times.\nWhy you ran into such a problem before is beyond me, but like \"Centaurus A\" suggested, try copying a few files over at first, and if it seems OK, then you know you're safe. If not, then you might want to ask around a bit more about why the slow down happens in the first place and how it can be prevented, as it isn't supposed to happen.\n\nA: Don't see why there would be a problem; however, it would be easy enough to test by copying a few files to a shared folder.  If the shared folder versions are problematic you would still have the originals.  \n", "Q: Install 10.10 Netbook Edition on Eee PC [1015] using a USB HDD I got brand new Eee PC as a christmas present and wanted to immediately install Ubuntu on it. For that I downloaded the netbook edition and set-up my USB hard disc (note: HDD not flash drive) according to the guide on the official download website.\nThen I set-up the boot priority to \"removable devices\" as first priority. If I boot now, however, the HDD is not booted. Is it not possible to do it that way?\n\nA: After all I figured out how it works. Here is the trick.\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow the instructions on the download website to create an installer USB stick. You can do this in the Windows installation that comes with the netbook. \n\n*Now restart your netbook immediately and hit ESC immediately. This will launch the BIOS settings manager.\n\n*Here go to boot settings. Now you do not need to change the boot order to have \"removable devices booted first\". Rather, from the menu entry under boot sequence, enter the submenu \"Hard drives\" (or something like that) and here change the priority of the drives such that your USB stick is booted first, and not your HDD. It might be confusing that your stick is not handled as a removable device, so watch up at this point.\n\n*Install Ubuntu! Some notes on the installation: There will be 4 partitions. The last one is a seemingly unnecessary one with 21MB of empty space. Keep this one. It is used internall by the Eee PC to speed up the boot. The rest can be erased. Also, at some points the installation might be really slow, or even frozen. Be patient, it is not. It might take as long as 10 minutes, but then it should work.\n\n*Boot and enjoy. Everything works smoothly and out of the box!\n\n\nBonus hint: Under mouse settings you can enable two finger scrolling just like it is possible with the Eee PC under Windows (without requiring extra Asus software...).\nI hope this clarifies things for future users. Cheers!\n\nA: First in ANOTHER pc install the LIVE CD on a usb hard drive or a usb pen drive. Then go to the EEE PC and install it on the place where you want to install it. I have done the following using 10.04 and 10.10:\nUsing the EEE (The same one you are mentioning here) i install in the internal hdd and also on an usb 250gb hard drive connected to it.\nRemember that if you have multiple removable devices you need to specify which one will boot in what order.\nPlease test with 10.10 since it is the latest.\n", "Q: Setting up Ubuntu One address book I deleted the Ubuntu One address book from Evolution, but now want to use it.

I set up everything else: Ubuntu One Account, the Ubuntu One program on my PC, so just need to make my Contact sync.\n\nA: It should be as simple as adding the desktop couch contacts book back, like so:\n\nFrom the New menu under contacts you can add an Address Book, that will show a window which you can put the type as CouchDB, give it a name such as \"Ubuntu One\" and then select \"Desktop CouchDB\" as the Server.\nMore detail: This ties into this couch file in your home directory which is automatically added to your ubuntu one account:\n\nAssuming deleting the address book from Evolution didn't delete this file, then you should have a working and syncing address book.\n", "Q: How to remove or hide the GRUB boot menu? Recently I decided to use only Ubuntu and there is no Windows in my laptop. When I turn on my laptop the GRUB menu is showing but I don't need to choose OS anymore. \nHow can I remove or hide this?\nAnd after removing this how could I access to recovery mode?\n\nA: I believe a better solution is to use the value:\nGRUB_HIDDEN=1 \n\nthen set the time out to something longer than 0 this way you can access grub since its hidden in the background, and you have a chance of actually stopping the boot sequence and selecting another kernel / recovery mode.\na feature that can come in handy when you have a broken system. You can read more about it here\n\nA: The answers above didn't work for me so I thought I'd post this for completeness. In my version of grub the timeout screen doesn't hide when the GRUB_TIMEOUT=0. This seems to be a bug filed here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1273764.\nAn easy (but not so elegant) workaround is to set your GRUB_TIMEOUT=0.1. Apparently there is a script which overrides the value of the timeout when it = 0 for the user's own good! \nMy grub configuration file just for anyone who wants to see is:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0.1\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0.1\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR='lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian'\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"splash\" \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\n\nA: To not see the GRUB menu while booting:\n\n*\n\n*Open the /etc/default/grub file using from terminal entering: gksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*Change GRUB_TIMEOUT=10 to GRUB_TIMEOUT=0\n\n*Save the file and quit the text editor.\n\n*Run: sudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot.\n\nThis will remove the time that you need to wait for the GRUB menu to disappear.\nIMPORTANT: If then you need to change to Recovery mode in some instance just press ESC when Linux starts. That is between when the BIOS finishes loading all necessary stuff and the Operating System starts. Then the GRUB menu will appear giving you the change to select the recovery mode.\n\nA: Another possibility if Windows has been removed from the computer is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the Windows boot loader from the ESP. This will normally be done by typing sudo rm -rf /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft.\n\n*Type sudo update-grub.\n\n\nWhen the update-grub script runs, it should note that there's no Windows and therefore generate a grub.cfg file that includes no option to boot Windows and that doesn't present the menu.\nNote, however, that this approach makes it impossible to boot Windows. This is fine for Behzadsh, since the question specifies that Windows has been removed from the computer. (In fact, this approach essentially finishes the task of the incomplete removal that's already been done.) This approach is wrong for somebody who simply wants to bypass the GRUB menu but still retain the ability to boot Windows -- say, by using the computer's built-in boot manager to boot Windows. This approach will make it impossible to boot Windows, at least until the Windows boot loader is restored.\n\nA: Hide GRUB menu while dual booting For newer versions of Ubuntu\n\nThis solution was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\nYou can still open GRUB menu by pressing shift key while booting. Otherwise it will automatically open choosen system.\n\nTo do that you need to make changes in file /etc/default/grub. However after updating GRUB settings the changes won't be visible due to one of scripts which is used to generate final file. That's why you need to make additonal changes. I recomend to backup files in case something went wrong.\nHere are the steps you need to do:\n\n*\n\n*Edit grub file:\n\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nYou need to edit these two parameters:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\nYou can choose default system in parameter:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nWhere the bolded number corresponds to options sequence in GRUB menu.\n\n\n*You have to edit script 30_os-prober which overwrite these changes while dual booting. The scripts used along with /etc/default/grub while doing update-grub can be found at /etc/grub.d.\n\nsudo nano /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober\n\nAround line 30 in this file in function:\nadjust_timeout () {\nif [ \"$quick_boot\" = 1 ] && [ \"x${found_other_os}\" != \"x\" ]; then\\\nYou need to comment these line by adding # at the beginning.\n#set timeout_style=\n#if [ \"${timeout}\" = 0 ]; then\n#set timeout=10\n#fi\n\n\n*After doing that you need to generate new grub.cfg file.\n\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n\n*You can check if these line are commented by checking new generated file grub.cfd\n\ncat /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\n\n\n*Now you can reboot your computer and check if changes work.\n\nLink to answer\n", "Q: freeBSD bootable CD/USB from Ubuntu How to create bootable CD or USB (preferably) from Ubuntu?\nI tried FreeBSD-8.1-RELEASE-i386-memstick.img from freeBSD.org with ubuntu service: Startup Disk Creator - but it fails saying: \"Installation failed\".\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: Never mind, unetbootin did the trick.\n", "Q: Conky forecast F C output Temp: ${execi 3600 conkyForecast --location=01104  --imperial datatype=HT} \n\nThis what I have and it shows the right temp but it says 25° AF.\nAny help or hints appreciated\nAnd as allways TYAVMIA\n\nA: If you use --hidedegreesymbol option and the A goes away, then it's probably because the degree symbol is being incorrectly converted to/from utf8.\nOTOH if you use --hideunits and the A goes away, then it's likely a bug in the system.\nEither way you should report the issue to the conkyForecast creator Kaivalagi to try and get a fix.

Is there a way to run Braid using ATI's open-source drivers? The game always crashes. When do get it to start in windowed mode once i go to the first level it will crash. I am using the lastest version of Braid (ST3C ignored)\nWhen I use the proprietary drivers Braid works flawlessly and World of Goo performance is increased. However there is terrible screen tearing with the ATI propritary drivers.\nSo my question is: How do I play Braid if I want to use the proprietary drivers?\n\nA: Did you try to turn off desktop effects while you play? I saw on forums that compiz may cause flickering of video while on.\n\nA: Try Alt + F2 and metacity --replace before you play and game and use Alt +F2 and compiz --replace after the game.\n\nA: 1. Consider switching to LXDE or KDE desktop environment\nI think you should seriously consider switching to Lubuntu. Compiz is bollocks and it will remain so at least to late 2013. That's if you believe it will -ever- do less harm than good, that is. Please note that you can install LXDE on regular Unity Ubuntu and choose your desktop environment at login! (session)\nLXDE also affects gaming performance?\nIf I install any desktop environment (like XFCE) alongside Unity can it affect Unity?\n2. Re-consider your choice to use open-source ATI drivers\nThey are usually 3 times (yup, 300%) slower than the proprietary ones. See:\nHow to review the current state of open source vs. closed source graphics drivers?\nIf you have ATI/Intel hybrid (switchable) graphics: You can use your Intel for desktop and ATI for gaming.

I've got a 3-rd party proprietary application server daemon which can be started and stopped by couple of command lines. I need this daemon to start when the system starts up and correctly stopped on system shutting down. How do I correctly implement this? Is it enough to copy some script inside /etc/init.d and modify it accordingly?\n\nA: Make a copy of /etc/init.d/skeleton and edit it at appropriate places to start/stop/restart your service. It is very well commented so you should be able to create a working init.d script in no time.\n\nA: *\n\n*Add your commands to /etc/rc.local\n\n*So that your daemon will get start automatically on system startup.\n\n\nA: 2020 April\nSome good answers here. For up-to-date instruction:\n\n\n*\n\n*init.d services were replaced by upstart (which uses /etc/init instead of /etc/init.d)\n\n*upstart had a very brief existence and was replaced with systemd\nMaking a systemd service\nSupposing you decide to name your service myservice, create a file /etc/systemd/system/myservice.service:\n[Unit]\nDescription=A service that I made\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nExecStart=/bin/bash /home/myuser/myservice.sh\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n3 useful commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo systemctl enable myservice makes the service alwasy begin on system startup\n\n*sudo systemctl start myservice manually starts the service\n\n*sudo systemctl stop myservice manually stops the service\n\n\nFor additional config options and legal values that you can put into your service file, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#Options\n\nA: init.d is the old, deprecated system for starting daemons; is has been supplanted by upstart. Upstart has the advantage of being far easier to configure and allows proper sequencing of task initialization.\nThe configuration files for upstart live in /etc/init and if your daemon has no pre-requisites it can be as simple as tty1.conf:\n# tty1 - getty\n#\n# This service maintains a getty on tty1 from the point the system is\n# started until it is shut down again.\n\nstart on stopped rc RUNLEVEL=[2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nrespawn\nexec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1\n\nin which case you can copy that file and modify to taste. More complex configurations are best documented at the upstart site and in other entries in /etc/init.\nadded in response to comment\nWhether you use upstart or init.d, you'll still need some way of determining when Firebird is properly initialized. Unfortunately, Firebird itself doesn't seem to have a good way of verifying that it is installed and running. Therefore, the recommendation to stick your program start into /etc/rc.local is certainly the easiest, and on Ubuntu - at least - is guaranteed to run about as late as possible in the boot process.\n\nA: if you do not want to migrate to UPSTART, but want the classic approach, you must:\nNOTE: i am saving the service and the program with the same name in different directories (but you can change this, as long as it is reflected in your service file).  change \"myscriptname\" and \"myprogramname\" to real names!\n\n\n*\n\n*save your program that will run as a service in /usr/sbin\nsudo cp myprogramname /usr/sbin/myscriptname\n\n*create a basic startup script (use /etc/init.d/skeleton as reference)\n\n*move this script to /etc/init.d\nsudo mv /etc/init.d/myscriptname\n\n*give this script executable permission (i used 775, but you can set it lower)\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/myscriptname\n\n*goto /etc/init.d\ncd /etc/init.d\n\n*include in startup list with low startup priority\nsudo update-rc.d myscriptname defaults 97 03\nreboot your machine and check if the service has started properly\nsudo ps -A --sort cmd\n\nif your service is not starting properly, you should first check if it runs when called by hand:\ncd /etc/init.d\nsudo service myscriptname start\n\nbelow i include a sample service file that actually works.  compare it to skeleton service so as to understand what you need to configure.

When running update-mime-database - usually automatically launched by apt-get - why do I reliably get complaints like:\nUnknown media type in type 'all/all'\nUnknown media type in type 'all/allfiles'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/mms'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/mmst'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/mmsu'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/pnm'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/rtspt'\nUnknown media type in type 'uri/rtspu'\nUnknown media type in type 'fonts/package'\nUnknown media type in type 'interface/x-winamp-skin'\n\nIt doesn't seem to be hurting anything, but chronic errors during updates risk obscuring an error that I do care about.\n\nA: That's a problem with update-mime-database and the MIME standard itself. Originally it was supposed to be extensible. But the IETF dumbed it down, and no new major mime types are registered (application/* is used as undifferentiated catch-all). The reasoning/surmise behind that being, that few tools are designed to work correctly with new MIME types.\nNow update-mime-database at least doesn't fall over when it sees pseudo classifiers like uri/ and fonts/ or interface/. So I assume it only complains because other apps might actually trip over them. strings gave me following list of probably built-in list of \"safe\" MIME types:\n\n\n*\n\n*text\n\n*application\n\n*image\n\n*audio\n\n*inode\n\n*video\n\n*message\n\n*model\n\n*multipart\n\n*x-content\n\n*x-epoc\n\n\nMeaning it would nag over any other x- or x. and vnd. or prs. major mime types. Curiously inode/ is anything but an official media type.\n\nA: Actually you can fix it simply by doing\nsudo rm /usr/share/mime/packages/kde.xml \nsudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime\n\nHere is a quote from Ana Guerrero in 2008 so you'd think it would be fixed by now.\n\nThose fake mimetypes are installed by kdelibs with the file\n  /usr/share/mime/packages/kde.xml since long time ago. They are kept in\n  kde4libs. \nIn a recent version, update-mime-database became verbose about this unknown\n  types, and that is why you get this error when you update stuff and then\n  update-mime-database is run.\n  It is unlikely to be changed.\n\n\nA: It appears that there are a pile of KDE libraries that bring in these otherwise Gnome unfriendly mime-type definitions. In my case, the libraries were added as dependencies to a KDE application package that I later uninstalled.\nTo remove the pile of KDE libraries and their associated /usr/share/mime entries, I used:\nsudo apt-get purge kdelibs-bin kdelibs-data \nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\nsudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime\n\nDo be careful that the first command does not force removal of a package you need before you confirm the removal. Getting rid of kdelibs-bin will then make a large set of packages unneeded and ready for autoremove.\nI found the basis for this fix in an old bug report for Intrepid Ibex.\n\nA: Backup your /usr/share/mime directory, just in case.\nI solved it by removing all the .xml files on /usr/share/mime directory then run the update command \ncp -R /usr/share/mime /usr/share/mime_back\nfind  /usr/share/mime -name *.xml -exec rm -rfv {} +    \nupdate-mime-database /usr/share/mime\n\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/299482/789190.\nhttps://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=469833\n", "Q: What happens when we uncomment GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true? what happens when we uncomment GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true in /etc/default/grub.\n\nA: *\n\n*Well i think the comment above that line says it all\n# Uncomment if you don't want GRUB to pass \"root=UUID=xxx\" parameter to Linux \n\n*After uncommenting that line root= will be passed as device name and not UUID.  \nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.30-1-amd64 root=UUID=...\n                to\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.30-1-amd64 root=/dev/sdX\n\n*However it is not recommended to uncomment that line,coz if you delete/create a new partition the partition table will get changed.\n\n*So that you cant boot into the system.\n\n\nA: when uncomment it, the next time grub regenerates /boot/grub.cfg will put absolute device names instead of UUID- i.e. /dev/sdXY\nso if you re-arrange partitions in partition table (for example insert/delete partitions) and partition numbers changed- grub can't find the kernel to boot\nwith UUID, even re-arranging the partitions won't break things\nthe con of UUID is that its hard to they are long and therefore hard to remember.\n\nA: The real deal is about adding disks to your system.  If your disk was previously /dev/sda, and was plugged into SATA1 as the only drive, and later you added a second drive, but plugged it in to SATA0, it would become /dev/sda, and your root= mapping would be invalid.  UUID's don't have this issue however, since they are unique identifiers.\nAlso if you have several expansion cards, they are sometimes detected at slightly different times, resulting in different drive name assignments for the drives hanging off them.  Again, UUID is unaffected.  Also if a drive goes dead, sometimes another drive takes it's place, e.g. if /dev/sda dies, perhaps on next boot /dev/sdb magically becomes /dev/sda..  It happens.\nI'd say the bigger the system it is or is likey to become, the more possibilities of a drive shuffle on boot..\nPersonally I don't care for using UUID's for root=, but I see where it has it's place.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox not saving the album art permanently I run ubuntu 10.10 and use rhythmbox (version 0.13.1) regularly with the albumartsearch plugin installed.

I had a problem with a disk and ran badblocks.\nSo now when I run dumpe2fs (also from e2fsprogs):\nsudo dumpe2fs -b /dev/sdc1\n\nI get a list of bad badblocks such as:\ndumpe2fs 1.41.11 (14-Mar-2010)\n192\n1592\n2416\n3112\n3552\n...\n\nBut in fact, I realised that the problem came from the rack and not from the disk. I was using the rack in eSata and got plenty of read errors. Now i switched to USB, it's not as fast, but no errors at all.\nSo my question is:\nHow do I reset the badblocks list stored in the inode #1 (badblock inode)?\n(of course, without reformating!... That's the last thing I'll try if I get no solution)\nBecause apparently blocks are not at all \"bad\", they were just reported so because the rack is faulty.\n\nEdit: I tried to run another badblocks once the disk was connected to USB but no success: previously found bad-blocks remained.\nI ran:\nsudo badblocks -i /tmp/emptyList -s /dev/sdc1\n\nthe file /tmp/emptyList being empty so that badblocks is fed an empty list of known bad blocks. But apparently, it's not THE list of bad blocks, it is the ADDITIONAL list of bad blocks, which would be added to the existing ones declared in the inode #1.\nThe documentation (man) is not very accurate about that.\n\nA: ATTENTION: this is a risky operation, don't do it if you don't fully master what are the risks!\nI just did:\nsudo debugfs -w /dev/sdc1\nclri <1>\nquit\n\nThis clears the inode number 1 (the one containing bad blocks list) on your filesystem.\nThen you have to run an e2fsck again to reset various things, and your are done!\n", "Q: Updates kill Keyboard and mouse I had applied all the updates available for on 23rd Morning and Keyboard and mouse stopped working thereafter. The updates amounted to around 230 MBs in size. I can use the keyboard to select other items in Grub menu and it works upto the login prompt. I can change the console to ctrl+alt+F1 to F6 during boot up before the login screen. No response thereafter. I have set the autoloin after 10 Seconds and also the notification asks me for enabling compositing.\nSome thread advises me to remove the .gconfd folder of my home. Please advise whether it is safe. I have done some customizations in Ubuntu. will they be lost? \nWhen booted in recovery mode, the screen remains blank without the options like Repair Packages, Root shell, Resume etc. BTW, ctrl+alt+del reboots the blank screen.\nWhat to do now? I thought that Recovery mode boot will give me the menu of these above items.\n\nA: A relatively safe way to test the \"something in .gconf doesn't like me\" hypothesis is\ncd\nmv .gconf dot.gconf\n\nwhere the obvious inverse\nmv dot.gconf .gconf\n\nwill set things back to the way they were if this doesn't help. Also useful for testing this hypothesis is to adduser a dummy account and see if a fresh user is also so afflicted.\nIncidentally .gconfd contains very little information, perhaps you misread the original recommendation?\n\nA: My issue seems similar enough to post here, although my keyboard (and mouse) do not work at the login screen at all.\nI had apt upgraded, and while the box booted to the lightdm login screen, keyboard and mouse were non-responsive (laptop internal, also I tried plugging in usb).

After installing Dropbox I was happy to see that although the installer said it would be version 0.6.7, it actually installed Dropbox 1.1.0. \nThis version includes the new application indicator. However, Ubuntu does not ship with an icon for this by default.\nHow can I replace the icon with a nice, monochrome icon set?\n\nA: For ubuntu 10.x and Dropbox 1.x:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download one of the widely available Dropbox icon sets. For example, one of these.\n\n*Unpack the set into a temporary directory and make sure it contains the following icons:  \ndropboxstatus-busy2.svg\ndropboxstatus-busy.svg\ndropboxstatus-idle.svg\ndropboxstatus-logo.svg\ndropboxstatus-x.svg  \n\n*Find out which icon set you're using.

In terminal the bash history is often helpful when you are searching for a command-line that you already used. But is there a way to influence the behavior of the bash history (i.e. which commands are saved, how long they are saved, how many are saved and so on)?\n\nA: Several variables control the behaviour of your history:\n\n\n*\n\n*HISTCONTROL: controls how values are saved in your history. The values ignorespace, ignoredups and erasedups can entered here (separate them by colon).\n\n*HISTFILE: sets the location of the history file.\n\n*HISTFILESIZE: sets the maximum number of lines in your history file.\n\n*HISTIGNORE: has a list of pattern which the bash ignores (see the other answer for syntax).\n\n*HISTSIZE: contains a number of lines which are remembered in the actual shell.\n\n*HISTTIMEFORMAT: contains an expression how an entry is formatted (see other answer)\n\n\nA: Setting timestamp for history:\n\n\n*\n\n*By default, history do not append with timestamp, but it is easy to configure it to display timestamp, you just need to set one environment variable HISTTIMEFORMAT.\nexport HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%h/%d - %H:%M:%S \"\n\n*Execute history again to see the result. \n\n\n*If you dont want to save the commands in history,then\nexport HISTSIZE=0\nVARIABLES: \n\n\n*\n\n*HISTFILE - Controls where the history file gets saved.           \n\n*HISTFILESIZE - Controls how many history commands to keep in HISTFILE.    \n\n*HISTSIZE - Controls how many history commands to keep in the history list of current session.\n\n*HISTIGNORE - Controls which commands to ignore and not save to the history list.\n\n\nNote: \n\n\n*\n\n*You will loss your settings once you close your terminal.So if you want it to have permanently then you should add the above command to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases.\n\n\nA: You could add a line like\nexport HISTFILESIZE=5000\n\nto your ~/.bashrc to increase the size of the history. By default commands started with a space are not saved. That is due to the export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth that is globally enabled in ubuntu by default.\nYou can also ignore commands starting with l or which by using \nexport HISTIGNORE=\"l*:which*\"\n\n\nA: There is a way to tell history NOT to remember a command: just start with a space.\nThere is also a very easy way te retrieve a specific command: type CTRL+R and a word from the command you are searching for.\nThere is certainly a way to increase the default history which is 500 lines by defaults... but I don't know how, sorry!\n", "Q: Best Graphics Card For Ubuntu I am trying to find a useable graphics card which has support for compiz and the unity interface.\n\nA: I find that integrated Intel cards are generally very well supported.  They aren't as powerful as discrete cards, but they are powerful enough to support unity.  And usually better supported than either ATI or NVIDIA.\n\nA: I have a Sapphire Radeon HD 6870 graphics card on a very fast computer. My processor is an AMD 1090T (6 core).\nThe grahics performance even with an application like Google-earth is terrible with the proprietary drivers (11.5, 11.4) as well as the open source drivers when using Ubuntu linux 11.04. When I rotate the earth in google earth it looks like an intermittent slide show with variable frequency. When running glmark2 there is sometimes no image at all and then intermittent snapshots.\nUnder windows 7 the card is fantastic. I can set games to absolute maximum options on the display and it is smooth and real time. The card runs cool and quiet. It gives 7.8 out of 7.9 on the windows experience scale. Problem is I hate windows!!!\nI tried a low end Nvidia card vn 240 gt with the proprietary drivers and wow it outperforms the HD 6870 (which is more than double the cost) in very way. Smooth graphics in Ubuntu Linux 11.04 with both the proprietary and open source drivers.\nInterestingly the HD 6870 performed better when using Maverick but still not great.\nFrom what I have been reading the problem may be with the linux kernel. I use 2.6.38-9 and the drm is not sorted out yet.\nMy advice is stay away from ATI if you use linux. If you only use windows (why would you be reading this forum?) then go for ATI.\nI compared a low end integrated Intel video card to my HD 6870 and it also out performed my card. The intel and the nvidia card seemed almost equal and very acceptable.\nI hope the performance improves drastically in the future or else I will sell my card and buy a Nvidia GTX 460 or 470.\n\nA: Almost any graphic card is supported on the 2D level more or less sufficiently. There is no generally valid recommendation as it depends very much on your personal needs.\nDifferences exist in the support of special features such as HDMI, dual monitor support, energy saving modes, and unfortunately still 3D support. For most of these features you depend on proprietary drivers from the manufacturer. These drivers are not so well integrated in a Linux environment, NVidia drivers have done this better than ATI fglrx. A major drawback of proprietary drivers is that in future releases your then \"dated\" card will no longer be supported.\nAt the moment, and in case you want to set up your system as \"Open Source Only\" you are better off using Intel graphics that are fully supported by open source drivers. Open source radeon drivers for ATI cards also have a quite mature state of development, and the nouveau open source NVidia pendant is catching up rapidly.\n\nA: I say. First pick a card you would like, then try to google out someone who runs ubuntu with it. You find problems you don't want to deal with, go back to picking different card :D\nIf you need some advanced rendering and stuff that needs or can nicely use CUDA then you need Nvidia. (And for a desktop in general with what ATI and Nvidia have to offer currently, I would stick with Nvidia)\nWhen it comes to laptop and graphics card (I have Nvidia also there) I would reconsider options cause High end Nvidia cards in laptops tend to be pretty loud and overheating when stressed out for long enough(but unless you use CUDA a lot and/or play games then it should be fine)\nAnyway you should do some research for specific model and find out which driver works best for it in ubuntu. But I have to say that usualy there aren't much more trouble with stuff like this in ubuntu than in windows. It's just that when something with drivers goes wrong in ubuntu it's much more visible :D...\nAlso once you get it done. Never update a good working driver unless it solves some compatibility issues, or other stuff you really might need or want!! And it's good habit to google those driver's performace under ubuntu before you really decide to do that.\nI've gone \"trigger happy\" with updates just few days ago and it was a disaster :D\n\nA: Depends. If you are going to use ANY kind of laptop. Stick with Intel. Any Intel will do. Nvidia, although very good, heats up very fast the laptop and you will always need some kind of cooling system to have a normal temperature inside the laptop. Most heat problems in laptops are do to some of the Nvidia cards if not all. Having a source of heat so strong inside a laptop is a bad idea if the laptop does not count with a very good cooling system.\nIf you are into Desktop, i highly recommend NVIDIA. From a GeForce 4200 and above you should be fine using Compiz with full effects. With TNT and Geforce 2 cards i recommend having Compiz with less effects. But overall NVIDIA has a VERY GOOD performance using the proprietary drivers. (The Nouveau Open Source drivers are also good but not for 3D games yet)\nATI has many issues still (Am a Ati hater still) but i can not put aside the fact that Ati/AMD has made open sourced the Ati Code which has improved many times over from the beginnings of this year up to now. Ati drivers have come a VERY long way in so little time and i have a big hunch (I hope it does not happen for Nvidia lovers sake ;) ) than next year we will see a very strong Ati Open Sourced driver that can deliver even better than the Nvidia closed source. Please do remember that just a year ago, the Closed source Ati driver for linux was several times better than the Open Sourced one and now the Open Sourced and Closed Source are very much like (And in some instances better than the closed one). So despite the fact that i hate Ati, i see a very bright sun shiny future for it in the coming months. (Arggg i still hate you hehe)\nSo in conclusion, for the time being:\nUse INTEL if you are using a laptop and want the laptop to last several years ALIVE!\nUse NVIDIA if you want to play games, use compiz effects a lot, etc...\nUse ATI closed/open drivers but be warned that you will have problems sometimes with compiz effects, games, etc.. At least for the time being.\nFor you question about \"are all NVIDIA cards alright\" yes they are. From an 16MB TNT to a 9800 1GB Ram and up. But be sure to use the correct drivers for it.\nFor VERY old than Geforce 4 or less use: nvidia-glx-96\nFor Geforce 4 up to starting the 6xxx series use: nvidia-glx-173\nFor 6xxx series up to the last one use: nvidia-glx-185\nNote that you can use any of them for any card but that combination made above is the best you can have. Do not limit yourself with for example, if you have a 6xxx series card and do not know which one to use, go for the last nvidia-glx version. But if you are sure to have a very old one, i recommend the 96 version of nvidia-glx.\nHope all this info helps you.\n", "Q: How to replace whitespaces in a filename? i tried it the following way:\nrename 'bla bla .txt' blabla.txt\n\nBut this doesn't work, what's the correct syntax for this case?\n\nA: rename is specialized command for bulk renaming. Unintuitively, what we normally call \"renaming\" is actually a \"move\" to a new name:\nmv 'bla bla .txt' blabla.txt\n\n\nA: You shouldn't be using rename to rename just one file, use mv(1) instead.\nFurther, to escape whitepsace, prefix it with a \\:\n\"Ubuntu One\" → Ubuntu\\ One\nYour command would be\nmv bla\\ bla.txt blabla.txt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*the backslash tells bash that the next character is somehow special, e.g. \\a for 'bell', \\ for a literal space and so on\nsee man ascii(7) for more\nAlternatively, since you are now using the correct command mv, you can quote the filename if there are many spaces:\nmv \"bla    bla.txt\" blabla.txt\n\n(This would be bla\\ \\ \\ \\ bla.txt in escaped form)\n\n\n*\n\n*In bash, quoted strings (single or double quotes) are treated as a single argument, whereas unquoted strings will be split into multiple arguments, like this: \n\n\n*\n\n*[\"mv\", \"bla\", \"bla.txt\", \"blabla.txt\", ]\nand mv expects:\n\n\n*\n\n*[\"mv\", \"source\", \"destination\", ]\n\n\n*Note: typing 'mv' and the first few characters of the filename and pressing TAB will give you the escaped version of the file name, making renaming quick and easy.\n\nrename is used to batch-process the renaming of files using regular expression, as demonstrated in the example from its man-page:\nrename 's/\\.bak$//' *.bak\n\nTo strip any occurence of .bak (at the end of the string [$]) from all of the files matching \"*.bak\".\n\nA: rename \"s/\\s//g\" \"bla bla.txt\"\n\ns is the sed Substitute command.\n\\s is for whiteSpace\nYou are replacing with nothing.  Else replacement string goes after second forward slash.\ng is for Global, i.e. replace every instance. Omitting g replaces only the first instance.\n\nThis command will replace whitespace with underscore in all the files:\nrename \"s/\\s/_/g\" *\n\n", "Q: How to display shadows behind text? Is it possible to display shadows behind text on the gnome desktop just like in this picture?\n\n\nA: No , it's not easily possible yet.\nIt is a bug in Nautilus ( Launchpad bug and relevant GNOME bugzilla bug ).\nThe suggested fix is what you have requested here.\nHowever, there is a patch in upstream Bugzilla bug which intends to fix this. It's not yet perfect, but if you want to use the shadow feature you can build nautilus with that patch.\n", "Q: ps aux as non-root doesn't show all processes i'm using an ubuntu 10.04 server...\nwhen i run ps aux as root i see all processes when i run ps aux as nonroot i see JUST the processes of the current user\nafter a bit of research i found the following solution:\nroot@m85:~# ls -al /proc/\ntotal 4\ndr-xr-xr-x 122 root      root         0 2010-12-23 14:08 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  22 root      root      4096 2010-12-23 13:30 ..\ndr-x------   6 root      root         0 2010-12-23 14:08 1\ndr-x------   6 root      root         0 2010-12-23 14:08 10\ndr-x------   6 root      root         0 2010-12-23 14:08 1212\ndr-x------   6 root      root         0 2010-12-23 14:08 1227\ndr-x------   6 root      root         0 2010-12-23 14:08 1242\ndr-x------   6 zabbix    zabbix       0 2010-12-24 23:52 12747\n[...]\n\nmy first idea was, that it got mounted in a weird way: /etc/fstab is ok and it doesn't seem to be mounted in an weird way...\nmy second idea was, that there might be a rootkit: but it's not a rootkit... rkhunter tells me, that there is no rootkit installed...\ni don't know if it is since the machine got installed or came with an update. i've just installed zabbix-agent on the machine and realized, that it didn't work properly...\nI have already checked sysctl, with no result.\nsysctl -a | grep ps\nsysctl -a | grep proc\n\ni got a tip about grsecurity and googled a bit for it. dpkg shows that i'm using the standard kernel and no grsecurity seems to be installed. also the /dev/grsec doesn't exists.\ni've also stopped apparmor, but there is still the same problem.\ndpkg shows, that libselinux1 is installed, but not the selinux package... /selinux is empty...\nis there another way, that i can check if grsecrity, selinux are running?\nWhat could have caused such strange permissions (500) and how can i set it back to an normal level (555) ?\nCrazy, i've never seen something like that...\nthanks in advance for any help and merry christmas :)\njust to make it clear, what ps aux prints out (as root i see all proccesses also apache, that runs under www-data):\nzabbix@m85:~$ ps aux\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nzabbix   12747  0.0  0.0   9760   572 ?

The AMD drivers here are currently a version behind those released by AMD (they are based on Catalyst 10.11 rather than 10.12) but work perfectly well and of course install (and update) without any issues.\nIf you want the latest Catalyst version then the AMD installer is very good unless you use an unsupported kernel; AMD do not yet officially support kernel versions greater than 2.6.35. Assuming you are using Ubuntu 10.10 with 2.6.25 you will have no issues.\nOtherwise, look at my thread here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1615594.

I noticed that the Wireless indicator is red under Ubuntu, but is enabled under whatever Windows 7 I got on it. So, I understand that it may not get detected at all by Ubuntu at startup time, and there is no manual switch that I can simply slide to turn on/off.\nHow can I get the Wireless device turned ON by default at startup time, and is there any special driver I need to install (proprietary or not) to get it working ? \nMerci :-)\nUpdate: When actually installing on the computer, as a new install, the NIC is not detected at first, but upon restarting, I get a notification of a closed driver available for the wireless. Once installed, updated and restarted, it works fine. \n\nA: According to the wiki page for 10.04 you need to install the wireless drivers separately. \nWe need more information about your system, if you can add some log information to your question it would help determine exactly what (and wouldn't break anything more). \n\nEverything works out of the box but the recommended Broadcom STA driver does not appear to activate in live mode. Furthermore, on booting after installation a blank screen appears with a flashing cursor due to this issue. The workaround for this is to press Shift on reboot until the GRUB menu appears and select the recovery mode, followed by the fail safe graphics mode. Once booted into this low resolution mode, a standard restart should allow the computer to boot normally, but it many not boot properly on further attempts which is why it's imperative to immediately plug in an ethernet cable and enter the following two terminal commands to install the STA driver:\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nand then reboot.\n", "Q: Can't configure wireless now that WPA2 is enabled!

I had a DVD image attached to Virtualbox via Virtual Media Manager and had it deleted from my harddrive without removing or \"releasing\" it from Virtual Media Manager.\nNow the image is still shown in Virtual Media Manager but the remove and release options are greyed out.\nIs there a way to get rid of the image shown in Virtual Media Manager?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: That entry is not a problem. If you want to remove it, then place the CD/DVD-image in the exact same location it was originally loaded from, load the virtual HDD, unmount it from the Virtualization, then turn off the virtual HDD and remove from the list, and then delete the DVD-image file.\n\nA: If it's the VBoxGuestAdditions, I don't believe that this can be removed.  It's integral to VirtualBox, available from the Devices menu of any virtual machine.  If it's a general DVD iso or similar, you should be able to delete it by ejecting it from any virtual machines using it, then choosing the remove option in the Virtual Media Manager.\n\n\nA: If it doesn't work with the GUI you can try editing the XML files VirtualBox uses to store its parameters.\nUnder\ngedit ~/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml\n\nYou'll find  tags with separate tags for Disks, DVDs and Floppies.\n", "Q: How to archive/play DVD with menus and all to disk? I'd really like to copy all my DVDs to disk for convenience access, since I prefer browsing my filesystem to fiddling with disks. All solutions I've found yet (like dvd::rip) re-encode the contents and need complex manual steps. This question about VOBs also makes me wonder whether this is possible at all.\nIs there a good DVD archival-to-/play-from-hdd tool that allows storing the DVD's content losslessly?  If not, what are the technical hurdles to such a thing? \n\nA: The best way to do this is to create an ISO file from the DVD. You can then play the ISO file using VLC or mount it and use it as if you had inserted the DVD into the drive.\nThere is a really easy method that can be used for non evil DVDs. Simply insert the DVD, right click on the desktop icon that appears and click 'Copy Disk...'.\n\nThen choose to output to an image file:\n\nThis will create the ISO file. However, some companies feel the need to deliberately corrupt the DVD in a (successful) attempt to stop us making copies (which we are legally entitled to do for personal use) of our DVDs. If they do this, like in the DVD I am using for the screenshots, Brasero, the software used to copy the disk will crash.\nThere is an alternative method to copy DVDs that uses the command line with this command:\ndd if=/dev/dvd of=~/dvd_backup.iso\n\nIf this fails also, which is likely for evil corrupted DVDs, you will get output similar to this:\ndd: reading `/dev/dvd': Input/output error\n572352+0 records in\n572352+0 records out\n293044224 bytes (293 MB) copied, 145.3 s, 2.0 MB/s\n\nNext step, try using gddrescue. Once installed, you can use this command that will hopefully copy the data from the DVD using a technique that was originally designed for rescuing data from failing or corrupted hard disks:\nddrescue -d /dev/dvd ~/dvd_backup.iso ~/dvd_backup.log\n\nThis may work (it has done in the past for me) but it also may fail (which it did this time for me).\nIf all of these methods are exhausted, it seems unlikely that you will be able to create an ISO file, but you can rip the DVD using various software (I recommend VLC for this). This isn't ideal but is your only option (that I know) left once you have tried all the other options. \n\nA: *\n\n*Install acetoneiso\n\n\n*After installation you can find it under Applications>>Sound & Video>>AcetoneISO\n\n\n*Using it you can generate iso image from CD/DVD/Folder.\n\n\n*Also you can mount/umount iso images.\n\n\nA: Use brasero and save the dvd as an iso copy. You can then use vlc or totem to play the iso back later.\n\nA: I would use dv3500ea's method with a few changes. \nFirst, if it is an encrypted DVD (almost all commercial ones are), and it is legal where you live (or you just don't care), install libdvdcss2 from medibuntu.\nSimply insert the DVD, right click on the desktop icon that appears and click 'Copy Disk...'.\n\nThen choose to output to an image file. Use the properties button to select where the .iso file will be saved and what it will be named.\n \nYou can then play the ISO with full menus using VLC  or mount it and use it as if you had inserted the DVD into the drive.\n\nA: This worked for me:\nUsing VLC and after going to:\nMedia -> Open Disk... -> Browse root folder of the dvd (typically VIDEO_TS)\nSubtitles, audio...all working\nWhich totem (Ubuntu video player by default) I couldn't use the DVD menu.\n", "Q: Enable only 802.11b/g in a 802.11n in atheros wireless card I sometimes connect to a defective wireless AP in my office, whose 802.11n is somehow faulty.

Is there a way to do the same in Maverick? \n\nA: Researching here on the linux kernel wireless page for your driver the 'ath9k' shows:\nhttp://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/ath9k\nThat there is no way to switch off 802.11n support for this driver, not unless you modified the code and recompiled.

The sound in Enemy Territory: Quake wars used to work fine before, except that using the VOIP hotkey would crash it outright. Now, after some fiddling, I at first had sound that was delayed by half a minute, and now no sound at all.\nDoes anyone have tips on how to get VOIP working?\n\nA: I realize I am late on this, but hopefully it will help those who come here by a generic search.\nAs an alternative you can use the PulseAudio suspend command which is a little more convenient once you get it going but takes a little bit of set-up.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install alsa-oss if you have not already done so.\n\n*Then in the ETQW configuration file called etqwconfig.cfg (~/.etqwcl/base/etqwconfig.cfg) you need to make small changes. \nNote that it is inside a hidden directory, as indicated by the dot in front of the name. You need to show hidden files in your file browser in order to find it. .etqwcl should be inside your home directory. The file contains a note not to modify it directly, but I think that may be a Windows only thing.\n\n*Find the lines that begin with:\nseta s_alsa_lib\nseta s_alsa_pcm\n\nChange them to:\nseta s_alsa_lib \"libasound.so.2\"\nseta s_alsa_pcm \"hw:0,0\"\n\n\"hw:0,0\" refers to my sound card and the fact that the system calls it card 0, device 0. On a command line, type aplay -l to see your sound devices and to find out the number of your card.

As an example, here is the command on my menu:\npasuspender /usr/local/games/etqw/etqw +set r_useThreadedRenderer \"4\"\n\nThe +set r_useThreadedRenderer \"4\" part is not necessary, it just tells the game to use 4 CPU cores, which my system has. \nWith this setup, you will not need to type extra PulseAudio related commands each time you want to play the game, and it should automatically turn PulseAudio back on when you quit the game.\n\nA: This is a temporary fix and is a bit of a nuisance but...it works!\nBefore you run etqw open Terminal. (Can be found in Applications>Accessories) Run sudo killall pulseaudio then run etqw and the audio will be perfect!\nAfterward you will need to start pulseaudio again if you need it.\n\nA: You can temporarily suspend PulseAudio access while a program is running.  To do this, run the program in question from the terminal, and prepend \"pasuspender\" to the command name. \nExample:\npasuspender /usr/local/games/etqw/etqw-rthread\n\n", "Q: Should I align partitions on an SSD, if so how do I do it at install time? I just bought a new SSD (OCZ Vertex 2) and plan to do a clean install of Maverick on it (/home is on a separate HDD). I read that it is wise to align SSD partitions.\nWhat advantages does it truly bring to have an aligned partition on a SSD?\nAnd how do I create an aligned Ext4 partition for the new SSD during the installation of Ubuntu 10.10? \n\nA: \nWhat advantages does it truly bring to have an aligned partition on a SSD?\n\nBasically it's all about better performance. If it's really such a big deal with current generation SSDs - who knows, but aligning the partition won't hurt.\nAnyways, Ubuntu's installer automatically aligns the partitions correctly. The first partition starts at sector 2048, that is after 2048 sectors á 512 Bytes = 1 MiB, and 1 MiB is evenly dividable by all common SSD block sizes.\n\nA: Boot the LiveCD version with the default option \"try\" and do partitioning first using gparted and you will be all right - just make sure \"Align to:\" is properly set to \"MiB\" (by default it is since 2010 or so, but it's crucial, so better to check it).\nAfter partitioning is done, install the GNU/Linux distro (usually there is  desktop icon prepared).\nIf you want to be extra sure the alignment is correct, you might do additional checking: https://askubuntu.com/a/1061235/208566\nI've been always using gparted not only because of this, but also because some installers use MB units instead of MiB (I prefer MiB, and so does gparted)\n", "Q: Recommended storage scheme for home server?

It is not recommended to modify a file in place inside a Greyhole volume, it is better to move a file to another location, modify it there then put it again in the Greyhole volume.\n\n*Greyhole data must be accessed from Samba shares (even locally).\n\n\nA: well on raid systems not the disks must have the same size...\njust the partitions you want to add to the raid, need to have the same size to create a raid...\nthe strengths of lvm are, that you can easily grow your virtual disk by adding more partitions to it. and you have a snapshotting feature!\nyou can also combine lvm with raid... so that you have data security and the flexibility of lvm :)\n\nA: You can stack block devices in Linux and mixin \nthe value of both Software RAID and LVM which should\naddress all your needs. This can all be accomplished\nfrom the non-gui installer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a single partition that spans the 99% of the disk [1]\n\n*Create an MD RAID5 (preferably RAID6) with at least one hot spare\n\n*Initialize the MD array\n\n*Create an LVM VG\n\n*Add each MD device as a Physical Volume to the new VG [2]\n\n*Proceed to add swap and root logical volumes to VG\n\n*Format root with choice of filesystem (default is ext4)\n\n*Continue with installation\n\n\n[1] I encountered a very nasty fault once on SATA disks that\nhad lots of bad blocks. After using the vendor tool to reconstitute\nthe disk. My once identical set of disks was now unique, the bad\ndrive now had a few blocks less than before the low level format\nhad begun, which of course ruined my partition table and prevented\nthe drive from rejoined the MD RAID set.\nHard drives usually have a \"free list\" of backup blocks used for just\nan occasion. My theory is that that list must have been exhausted,\nand since this wasn't an enterprise disk, instead of failing safe\nand allowing me the opportunity to send it off for data recovery,\nit decided to truncate my data.\n[2] Never deploy LVM without a fault tolerant backing store. LVM\ndoesn't excel at disaster recovery, you're just asking for heartache and\nif you get it wrong, data loss. The only time it makes sense is if the\nVG group is confined to a single disk, like an external usb disk or perhaps\nan external eSATA RAID. The point is try to deploy your VG around backing\nstores that can hot plugged as a single unit, or as a virtual single\nunit which is demonstrated in the MD example above.\n\nA: What about http://zfsonlinux.org/ \nIt has the notion of disk pools that you can attach detach drives, I don't know if its production ready but still worth checking out.\n\nA: How about MHDDFS, it's already available in most distro's, and works like JBOD, however if drive's die, you only loose the data on that drive, not all of them. It get's seen as one logical drive pool, so for example you can copy the logical drive pool to another larger capacity disk as you upgrade down the track. Minimal downtime and minimal hassle, and looks easy to implement.\nCheck out how to use it here: http://zornsoftware.codenature.info/blog/why-i-ditched-raid-and-greyhole-for-mhddfs.html\n", "Q: Banshee displayed in song menu but does not show currently playing song I am using ubuntu 10.10 and am currently trying out different players. I started with the default player (Rhythmbox) however ran into issues..click here to view it. So I then decided to try out banshee (V1.9.1) which worked perfectly getting all my album covers and nicely integrating with the sound menu.\nHowever few hours later, banshee is still shown in the sound menu but when it plays a song it does not update the sound menu. It can be seen in the screenshot below. As you can see the song is being played at the moment but in the sound menu the play buttons and song are not displayed. So indeed the sound menu plugin for banshee is installed by default. \nAlso when I click the close button, banshee closes completely, normally it does close but the song plays in the background and can be controlled via the sound menu. To completely close it I had to click Ctrl + Q. \nIt was working all perfectly and then suddenly I have this issue. I have no idea on where to start troubleshooting..Can anyone help me?\n\nTo answer the comments and answers below,\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting did not help.\n\n*From V1.9.1 banshee made the sound menu plugin as a core plugin which is thereby installed by default and enabled. However for some reason I do not see this plugin in my extensions list. I tried reinstalling it two times and purging all configuration files but still have the same problem. I restarted after every install and uninstall of banshee.\nAlthough I must say this, before I unchecked certain extensions like the ipod/ipad extension (however not the sound menu extension) and those choices that I made were visible even when I uninstalled and installed banshee again. I have a feeling that the old configuration files of banshee were not completely purged.\nIs there a way to purge banshee completely? I mean everything and do a clean install of Banshee in the hope that this solves the problem?\n\nA: Go to preferences ->  Extensions and enable Sound menu integration for Banshee\n\nA: As mentioned in the question, the banshee Version 1.9.1 does indeed come with the sound menu extension as a core plugin. However for some unknown reason it is not present in my core plugin list as can be seen in the screenshot.\nSo what I did was, I installed the sound menu extension manually from the community extensions (downloaded from an article in omgubuntu.co.uk, click here to view it.)\nI know this is not the proper way to solve the problem as I am yet to find out why the sound menu core plugin was removed or not there, but I intend to look for the reason meanwhile.\n\n", "Q: How do I removed the keyring popup when I am accessing vino?

Now, after entering the password on the remote server, the following dialog pops on the local server (the one that usually don't have a monitor) before open the connection : \n\nWhy is that dialog showing?\nHow do I get ride of it?\n\nA: This is a known bug in the Debian/Ubuntu package of vino server. There is a workaround in the bug comments, which I'm reproducing here. Rumour says it's only good for 10.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up Applications->Accessories->Passwords and Encryption Keys\n\n*Right click Passwords:login and unlock it.\n\n*You should be able to expand the tree and find a listing for vino.

Enter the output, even the equal sign.\n\n\n*Save the config and close the editor.\n\n*Log out, log back in, and you can now use your VNC client to connect to your machine without being first prompted with the keyring.\n\n\nA: I have solved this problem. When you run vino-preferences, and check the box labeled Require the user to enter this password: the system will popup a menu asking for the default keyring. \nIt's easy, be sure to empty these fields, and accept the security warning that follows. Then write the viewer password as you want, reboot and you can connect without problems.\nIn the case you wrote something in these fields, you should remove the file:\nrm ~/.gnome2/keyrings/default.keyring then reboot and redo vino-preferences as I said before.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: cd ~/.local/share/keyrings/\nmv Default.keyring Default.keyring.backup\n\nor you can even remove Default.keyring file, but better - rename. Now you will be asked to create new password. Do it.\n\nA: I'd say click on \"Details\" in that same window and choose to the first option saying something like \"start keyring when i login\". It's by far the simplest and safest choice.\nIt took me like 2 hours to find that simple solution, i wonder how many people click on that option...\n\nA: The answer by @djeikyb did not work for me; when I did this, my VNC client could not connect (and I did use echo -n to base64 encode my password.)\nInstead, I stopped vino-server, restored my ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/remote_access/%gconf.xml (to undo the change completely), ran vino-preferences (from a console) and entered my connection password in the preferences dialog, then logged off/logged back in (which restarts my vino-sever).\nMy 'login' password is the default (in seahorse), and my 'default' keyring\ndoes not have a vino entry.\nNow my client can connect and I don't have to unlock my keyring.\n(Note: I'm running the latest update for vino-server on Ubuntu 11.10;\nI think some bugs have been fixed in vino)\n\nA: there is no Passwords and Encryption in Xubuntu menus . you should manualy add this .\nyour Solution is Here : \n http://www.geekyeric.com/?p=67\n\n", "Q: How to connect to DSL modem using PPPoE?

So that /etc/ and /var (for example) are on different drives? (Since /var/www/ is, to me, more closely related to the contents of /home than anything else).\n\n\nA: I've used a 32gb one in the past and a 40gb SSD as / for some time now. I leave the swap on / and /home on my spinning disk. It's a great way to add some performance for about a hundred bucks.\nI created a directory called /var/jorge (on the SSD) to hold things from /home that would benefit an SSD, so I moved and symlinked the following directories:\n/home/jorge/.cache -> /var/jorge/.cache\n/home/jorge/.config -> /var/jorge/.config\n/home/jorge/.gconf -> /var/jorge/.gconf\n\nThis way your browser profiles and other things that matter are on the fast SSD.

If there is still the one or other package in your way it's probably the least time consuming thing to just purge these single packages.\nRemoving software you installed or performing a reinstall of Ubuntu only makes sense if the amount of harddisk space occupied is significant or if many of the apps are buggy and affect the system performance.\nBefore you proceed with deleting or reinstalling I recommend you check first if your system performance will really benefit from doing so.\n\nA: I do this occasionally, using aptitude. Aptitude is a console (\"old-skool\") tool that's powerful but a little tricky to get to use. It's like vim or emacs, when Ubuntu Software Center is like Gedit or AbiWord :-) Nevertheless, there's a good way to achieve your goal in aptitude, so if you're willing to give it a try, this might work for you.\nFirst install aptitude:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nYou might want to read the docs for aptitude. If you don't, you'll be following my directions below blind, and could fly into a mountainside that leaves your system unbootable, in which case you'll need to try one of the \"careful reinstall\" options where you do a fresh install trying to preserve your personal data along the way. The docs for aptitude are at:\nzless /usr/share/doc/aptitude/README\n\nNow, go into aptitude. I'll tell you a series of keys to press. The case (upper or lower) is significant: U is different to u.\nsudo aptitude\n\nu\n    (this updates the package database. press enter  to clear any warnings that popup afterwards)\narrow down to the section called \"Installed packages\"\nM\n    (this marks every package as automatically installed, so it schedules all of them for removal. don't quit now or you'll be in trouble)\n/\n    (this opens a search dialog)\nubuntu-desktop [ENTER]\n+(this tells aptitude you want to install ubuntu-desktop and all dependencies)\n[ENTER] (goes into the details for the ubuntu-desktop package)\narrow down to the \"Recommends\" line\n+ (tells aptitude to install all the recommended packages too)\ng (\"go\" - will tell you what it wants to do)\ng (confirms that you want to do it, and gets going)\nThat should leave you fully up to date, with a relatively clean, minimal desktop system.\nIf you get stuck, hit ? for help in aptitude. You may need to use a or z to scroll up and down in various places. I did say it was old-skool :-) But once you know how to use it, you can get a lot of detailed package management done quickly.\n\nA: I see if he installs it and doesn't format the installer will spare his home folder.\nIn any case the two partition recommendation is still valid (os and data should be separated)\n\nA: There is an easier and less intricate way of achieving Mark's solution.\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\nsudo aptitude markauto '~i !~M !ubuntu-desktop'\n\nThe former command installs aptitude.\nThe latter command says \"Mark every manually installed package that is not ubuntu-desktop as automatically installed\". aptitude will then interpret all packages that are not required or recommended by ubuntu-desktop as unnecessary dependencies, and remove them.\n", "Q: How to control gnome's auto mounting capabilities How to control gnome's auto mounting capabilities?\nWhenever I have a Gnome session opened (doesn't apply when no X session is active) some actions are taken when a CD-ROM is inserted or a USB drive is attached.\nWhere's the configuration for that? \n\nA: GNOME automounting capabilities are managed by Nautilus, the default GNOME file manager.\nNautilus also manage the desktop icons and other aspects, as automounting, and runs at startup to do its job even if you don't know.

Here you can control many aspect of automounting.\n\nA: open Nautilus and go to edit/preferences and then you want the media tab \n\nA: It depends on what you want to do. \nOptions that are spelled out in /etc/fstab will take precedence over FUSE (I don't know much about FUSE, and I'm assuming that it's the thing that does the automounting magic for GNOME). For example, I had a second hard disk that needed the \"user\" and \"noauto\" options (I didn't want it automounting) and adding its entry to /etc/fstab worked.\nI don't know how long this will continue to work, since the trend now seems to be to allow the automatic tools \"guessing\" the user's intent to overwrite configurations explicitly set by the user (for example, nm-applet overwriting /etc/network/interfaces).\n\nA: From https://help.ubuntu.com:\nGo to System->Administration->User and Groups, choose the user, click on\n\"Properties\", then go to the \"User Privileges\" tab. You should have the \n\"Access external storage devices automatically\" option\n\nA: All of you suggesting it's done by Nautilus - you're right.\nI found a solution to my problem in the gconf-editor configuration utility.

But it can't hurt to try. \n\nKeep in mind that storing your password on your hard disk is an immense security risk. You should be using this instead:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport gnomekeyring\nimport getpass\n\ngnomekeyring.unlock_sync(None, getpass.getpass('Password: '));\n\nYou can save this script, for example, as unlock-keyring.py and then do the following:\nsudo mv unlock-keyring.py /usr/bin/unlock-keyring\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/unlock-keyring\n\nFrom then, you can always just type unlock-keyring and be prompted for a password.

It was a red hat machine. I ask the user how he did this, but he did not know.\n(Note: I do know how to do this for samba. I'm interested in how you do it for other protocols.)\n\nA: You can announce services by using the avahi service. To announce a service, you have to add a service description file in the /etc/avahi/services directory. For example, to announce an sftp share, create a file sftp.service with:\n<service-group>\n  <name replace-wildcards=\"yes\">SFTP on %h</name>\n  <service>\n    <type>_sftp-ssh._tcp</type>\n    <port>22</port>\n  </service>\n</service-group>\n\nFor FTP you have to change the type to _ftp._tcp and the port to 21, for an NFS share you have the change the type to _nfs._tcp and the port to 2049, and you also have to include something like:\n<txt-record>path=/path/to/someshare</txt-record>\n\nThe avahi.service man page has all the information on the format of these files.\n", "Q: Is there a way to check if a program is available in the repository by commandline?

I'm not able to install a wireless driver into ubuntu 10.10. the driver is made for Linux kernel 2.6.32 and below. there is also an windows driver for it. the wireless device is a Rosewill RNX-N2LX. the drivers can be found here: http://rosewill.com/products/d_1643/productDetail.htm\nPlease help me, i just built this new computer but i dont have access to the internet.\n\nA: It's a sad fact that many vendors which claim to support Linux don't really support it.\nIt is a Wrong Answer for the vendor to expect clients to download an unsigned driver file from the Web to make their device work for Linux. Presumably, the provided file is source code which will then have to be compiled in order to be used. If your experience is anything like mine with ASUS, the provided code will be stale and will fail to compile.\nThe good news is that you might not have to deal with all that. The first step is to determine the device ID of the adapter. It appears to be a USB wireless adapter, so you will use the lsusb command to get this information. For non-USB devices you will generally use lspci\nIf you post the output of the command here, I will assist you in interpreting it. The information you want to extract from the output of the command is a hexadecimal number of the format \"nnnn:nnnn\" immediately following the string \"ID\" on the line that contains the vendor's name. Here's what my lsusb looks like:\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 045e:00dd Microsoft Corp. \nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 046d:0807 Logitech, Inc. \nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nOnce you have determined the device ID for the adapter, you can search for the appropriate kernel module for it. Googling the ID number along with \"linux\" or \"kernel\" sometimes works. There are also compatibility lists like this:\nhttp://linux-wless.passys.nl/\nYou'll notice that there is no vendor listing for Rosewill on this list. Most likely that means the vendor uses another company's chipset- the other company's name will then be the one that shows up in lsusb's output.\nOnce you have determined the correct driver for the device, simply do \nsudo modprobe [module-name] to load the module and see if it works. If you get a Module Not Found error, that probably means the module isn't installed. If this is the case, you will likely need to install the linux-backports-modules-compat-wireless package.\n", "Q: Differences between Qt and GTK programs? Refering to this question, there are two different versions of the Autokey program: Autokey (Qt-based) and Autokey-GTK. What are the differences between a Qt-based program and the GTK one and are there any differences from the point of view of the user?\n\nA: GTK and Qt are user interface toolkits and frameworks. GTK is the standard toolkit for GNOME/Ubuntu while Qt is used in KDE/Kubuntu. From the user's point of view I'd say it's just the looks that differ.\n\nA: Aside from small differences in layout and appearance, the GTK version also has a quick search feature for shortcuts/abbreviations that QT doesn't have which allows you to use a hotkey like CTRL + SPACE to bring up a search box to quickly find abbreviations.  This helps quite a bit when you have hundreds of abbreviations to try to remember.\n\nA: Another difference is that, if you are on Ubuntu, you may not already have all the QT stuff installed. On Kubuntu, you may not have all the GTK stuff installed. Hence it may make the download much bigger.\n", "Q: How to set resolution higher than maximum shown? I just bought an external monitor for my laptop (Asus VH242H) but cannot set its resolution to anything higher than 1600x900.

Finicky at best.\n1) If you can, try a DVI/HDMI cable. My laptop doesn't like external monitors larger than the internal screen when using a VGA cable.\n2) Add the X-Swat PPA to your system and update your graphics drivers.\n3) Check in CCC, under Display Manager, that Multi-Display is set to \"Multi-display desktop with display(s) ...\". Under Display Properties check Resolution is set correctly, then Apply. If this changes the overall Desktop Area you should be asked to save the changes and restart the machine; if this hasn't happened go to 4)\n4) Purge fglrx from your system (e.g. sudo apt-get purge fglrx, then sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf) Restart the laptop with the monitor connected; this will use the Open Source drivers, so you will lose Compiz and desktop effects. Now reinstall and re-enable fglrx, all with the external monitor connected to make sure it is picked up when the installer generates xorg.conf.\n\n\n", "Q: Realtime noise-removal with PulseAudio?

The one I found was the noise-cancellation module, which is one that dramatically lowers any static noise on the microphone and even A LOT of the background noise, basically giving you the benefit of only recording your own voice with excellent quality (For audio recording for example). To do this follow this steps:\n\n*\n\n*sudo nano /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\n\n*Add the following line anywhere on the file, but I recommend almost at the end where you will find a comment about Echo Cancellation stuff (~line 140):\nload-module module-echo-cancel\n\n\n\n*Reload PulseAudio (pulseaudio -k) or simply restart the computer. You should be able to select the new Noise Cancellation option from the Input Device Section:\n\nYou can find more information about it on the Echo Cancel Module Page\nSet input as default\nIf you wish to set as default the echo cancel device simply turn the above line into:\nload-module module-echo-cancel source_name=logitechsource\n\nand then at the bottom of the file add\nset-default-source logitechsource\n\nIn this case I named the source logitechsource, but you can name it whatever you want and simply either restart pulseaudio.\nRename device\nLastly, if you do not want a super long name on the Sound Settings (When you want to select an input/output device). My suggestion is renaming the input device like this:\nload-module module-echo-cancel source_name=logitechsource source_properties=device.description=LogitechHD\n\nAnd again, restarting pulseaudio. The end result looks like this:\n\nUPDATE - Full documentation Found Here Thanks to clément\n\nA: This is an old question, but I had the same problem and after some Googling (where I mostly found people who agreed it wasn't possible) and reading some man pages, I have now developed a solution based on user2330377's idea.\nFirst you need to create a noise profile for SoX. Just use any audio recording program to record a few seconds of noise, then cd into the directory you saved it to and do sox noise.wav -n noiseprof noise.prof.\nThen you need to create an ALSA loopback device:\nsudo modprobe snd_aloop\n\nThis is required because pulseaudio, unlike Jack, cannot directly connect audio software together; we will hence use the loopback device as a proxy.\nNow you need to start paman and find the names of both your microphone (or other recording device) and of the loopback device we just created. Once those are found, you can execute the following command to start recording sound from your microphone, piping it through SoX and then playing it on the loopback device:\npacat -r -d alsa_input.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo --latency=1msec|sox -b 16 -e signed -c 2 -r 44100 -t raw - -b 16 -e signed -c 2 -r 44100 -t raw - noisered noise.prof 0.2|pacat -p -d alsa_output.2.analog-stereo --latency=1msec\n\n(Where you need to substitute the correct device names for the -d parameters -- the input device for the first pacat invocation and the loopback device output for the second.)\nThere you go, almost done! As a last step, start recording sound with the application of your choice, then start up pavucontrol, change to the \"Recording\" tab and set the audio device used for recording (displayed as the grey button to the right) to \"Monitor of Loopback Audio Device\". You should now have a clear and noise-free recording!\n\nA: Investigation shows that there is no known way of doing real time noise reduction filtering with any Linux sub system. Some websites point to hardware you can buy which should do the trick much better than doing a software filter.\nAlternatively if this is for a recording, you could pass the sound through Audacity and use the noise filter there.\n\nA: Here's at leas tone way, implement webrtc-aec in the \nhttp://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/PulseAudio\nwebrtc-aec  Yes         Uses the webrtc.org AudioProcessing library for enhancing VoIP calls greatly in applications that support it by performing acoustic echo cancellation, analog gain control, noise suppression and other processing. \nHere's a paper dated 2013 on the subject (noise removal with pulseaudio not webrtc-aec specifically)\nhttp://lac.linuxaudio.org/2013/papers/37.pdf\n\"We have presented rst results of a multi-channel noise/echo reduction solution built on\ntop of PulseAudio and motivated the design decisions.

However, echo cancelling is mostly good for removing your fan noise and similar whereas NoiseTorch can automatically mute your microphone when not speaking in addition to removing some noise when speaking.\n", "Q: Login speed varies over time I have a weird problem with my Ubuntu right now. \nMy login speed is never consistent for months, sometimes it changes within weeks.

From where shell I get the concerned font file to install? I had previously Win XP and the fonts were installed but the same is not applicable for the Ubuntu. In indic case there is a facility to type gujarati as per the pronounciation using english alphabets and also gives display at a corner for guidance that which character required to be typed. Please suggest how to avail the same facility in this Ubuntu.\n\nA: IBus is perfect solution for you.\nSee this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ibus\n\nA: Navin, I guess the Google IME is not available on linux, so even If you use some software like Baraha - on windows, then you can emulate its benavior on Linux using wine, since you're using Ubuntu its easy to install WINE (http://www.winehq.org/) through Synaptic.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System - Admin - Synaptic Package Manager\n\n*Search and locate wine - Click on Radio button- Click on apply\nchanges - Thus wine will be installed\n\n*Download latest software from [Baraha][4] or likes of it.\n\n*and open it through wine...and get the job done.\n\n", "Q: Network Access: I can't access 192.168.1.101 from 192.168.1.102 I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 on my PC with IP 192.168.1.101. every thing work fine, e.g. my web server is running and I can see http://localhost/ or http://192.168.1.101 properly.\nBut the problem is that I cannot see my PC from my laptop at 192.168.1.102\ne.g. at my laptop http://192.168.1.101 gives Connection timed out in browser.\nor trying to telnet on any port leads to:\ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection timed out\n\nlaptop is running a fresh install of Ubuntu as well and there is no setup for firewall stuff in both computers.\nPS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both computers can ping each other well.\n\n*The router is a cicso linksys wireless ADSL modem.\n\n*Currently, I can connect to FTP server on the Windows running on 192.168.1.102 from 192.168.1.101 without problem.\n\n*I tested the address http://192.168.1.101 with my friends' laptops (They use Windows 7 and XP). both received \"Connection was reset\".

There are over ten thousand frame errors reported in your ifconfig output.\n\n\n*\n\n*Frame Errors: An incorrect CRC and a\nnoninteger number of bytes are\nreceived. This is usually the result\nof collisions or a bad Ethernet\ndevice.\n\n\nThis is sometimes caused by a switch port being set to 100/full duplex when your card is configured as auto/auto.

I have a Iball Baton ADSD2+ Router.  \n\nIt's working fine but the problem is when I boot into Ubuntu I have to unplug the usb cable and then plug it again, then it starts working.\nWhy do I have to re connect my usb cable? Let me know if you need more details.\n\nEdit : \nI am using a direct connection. I mean to say I don't have to enter a username or password. I am connected to internet as soon as I start my router. The problem is if I start my router before my computer I have to re connect my usb cable.\nEdit 1 : \nI tried have tried to start my router after boot, but just before login and my router connects. But I don't know why my router does not connect if I start before boot ?\nEdit 2 : \nIf I use Ethernet cable for connecting my router I don't have to re connect it again, but the problem still exists for the usb cable.\nThanks.\n\nA: This problem is not specific to your router so I dont think there is any problem with your router. In my experience, and from what I have found using Google, there is some bug in usbserial module and because of that devices using usbserial driver usually needs to be unplugged and replugged after boot so they can be correctly identified. I had this same problem with my ZTE AC2726 usb modem.\nYou can try manually unloading and reloading the usbserial module to see if your device gets recognized. If this doesnt work then I suggest you use ethernet i.e network cable to connect to your router instead of usb. Your router must have atleast 1 ethernet port. I am sure you wont have this problem with ethernet.\n", "Q: Monitor turns off when I unplug from AC power, how do I stop this? I'm running natty on a 13\" macbook pro, and when I unplug the AC power sometimes, the monitor turns off.

When I plug the adapter back in, the monitor comes back.\n\nA: Pommed is misconfigured by default to set brightness to 6 (out of 44000) on battery for nvidia. The pommed config file is /etc/pommed.conf, and the section is sysfs_backlight/on_batt. Setting this to a more reasonable, value such as 22000 fixes the issue. You can mess around with values to set it to by running\n$ cat /sys/class/backlight/${driver}/max_brightness\n$ echo ${0 < brightness < max_brightness} | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/${driver}/brightness\n\nNote that's kind of pseudo shell code, the value for driver will probably be the only subdir or backlight, so just hit tab in the shell to autocomplete it, and the value to echo can be whatever you want so long as it's between 0 and max_brightness.

I am looking for similar commands but file contents.\nJust in case you are wondering why I don't use tracker also like answered in the two posts, tracker have a set of prespecified folders to search in them, and whenever you make a search, you search in all of them. What I want is to be able to search in every project separately.\n\nA: You can try recoll, it is available in the repositories, it gives you a lot of control over the folders you want to index and search and where you want to store the index database, you can use multiple databases too, you can use the advanced search to return results from a specific folder.\nSee some of its features here, You can run it from the command line passing the query and other control  terms to it, see the short manual here.

It has been raised as such with the Opera team (the ID is DSK-324216) but as there has been no movement in nearly a year since reporting it, I'm not too hopeful of it ever being fixed.\nI discovered a workaround which involves creating a .css file in ~/.opera/styles/user and populating it with:\npre, code {\n    font-family: \"Ubuntu\", sans-serif;\n}\n\nYou can then select this file in Preferences > Advanced > Content > Style Options... > My style sheet.\n\nA: Well, it seems than even in v12.00 Next, this bug is not fixed in Opera.

I use guake very heavily, and ssh into more than 3 computers at any point in time. I also have daemons running on some tabs (terminals). What I want to know, Is it possible to have the name of the current command as the name of the Terminal? Rightclikcing a tab, and changing its name causes this: (Look at the tab after Terminal 5)\n\nThanks.\n\nA: I am not sure this works for guake, it works for most terminal emulators.\nYou can include an echo on your scripts to change the terminal title:\necho -ne \"\\033]0;your_title_here\\007\"\n\n\nA: This is a guake (0.4.1) bug.\nI just see and solve this problem via this bug report though the author say this is not the best method:　https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/205\n\ni've found out that moving the dialog\n  destruction code (guake.py line 983)\n  down after the code that sets the tab\n  label (line 986) actually solves the\n  problem. so the the code that works\n  for me look like this:\n    response = dialog.run()\n    # dialog.destroy() \n\n    if response == gtk.RESPONSE_ACCEPT:\n        self.selected_tab.set_label(entry.get_text())\n\n    dialog.destroy()\n\nmaybe there is some problem with gtk\n  and dialogs, but i haven't found any\n  code changes connected with gtk in the\n  version 0.4.1 diff.\n\nEDIT: guake 0.4.2 can change the tab name correctly\n\nA: Bit of a hack, but this will rename the current terminal to whatever you ssh'ed for.\nfunction ssh() {\n    guake -r \"$@\";\n    /usr/bin/ssh $@\n}\n\nAlso if you update your PROMPT_COMMAND, you can have a function to update the terminal name each time. Although this will not work for your ssh problem as it only changes the name after the command has run.\ne.g.\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=renameTerminal\n\nfunction renameTerminal() {\n    guake -r \"$SOMENAME\";\n}\n\n\nA: When I want to change the tab name in guake, I just right-click the tab name and left-click rename. A pop-up box opens to type the new name into. \n\nA: You can simply change the tabname with \nguake -r newtabname\n\nIf you want to get the latest running command, use for example \necho \"!!\" | cut -f 1 -d \" \"\n\n!! is expanded by bash when you type it. It's not expanded by alias substitution. So you have to use the history built-in to do the expansion to put it in an alias:\nalias setguaketitle='guake -r $(echo \"$(history -p !! )\"| cut -f 1 -d \" \")'\n\nwhen your last command was\necho this is a test\n\nthen calling \nsetguaketitle\n\nwill set the title to \"echo\".\n\nA: If you change your shell to zsh, you can add this to your ~/.zshrc:\npreexec() {\n    echo -n '\\e]0;'\n    echo -nE \"$1\"\n    print -nP '  (%~)'\n    echo -n '\\a'\n}\n\nand it will show the current command and the current working directory.

I've had SD cards do this often.\nUnfortunately there is not much of a \"solution\" - the only thing you can do really is manually mount the card (usually just a matter of going to \"Computer\" in nautilus, right clicking the SD card, and choosing mount).\nAfter looking at your output etc, it seems your adapter is faulty/being turned on after the system has been on at least once (thus only shows up on reboot - hard to explain what I mean correctly). Maybe it is a hardware problem.\n\nA: This may be totally off but I had--and solved--a similar problem.  If I booted my laptop (Ubuntu 10.10), the card reader wasn't recognised.  However, if I rebooted with a card in the card reader, it was recognised.  After much searching and head scratching, I stumbled upon the solution while enabling VMX extensions in the BIOS...\nThere was an (enabled) BIOS setting to make the card reader use a 'power saving' mode.  I turned off this setting and sure enough, the card reader was recognised when the machine booted; without having to insert a card at boot time.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with Ubuntu 10.04 onto Acer Extensa 5620-4020. I tried different recipes but no one help me. On this PC I have also WinXP and the same SD card just works fine. Accidentally I found the solution :-) May be ( this is my simply opinion ) some timing in Linux kernel/drivers is not long enough and after years of use the contacts on SD card or contacts on the PC socket become bad. If I just push the SD card Ubuntu doesn't recognize it, BUT, if I push the card SLOWLY I always have a mounted SD card and Ubuntu pop up a window to ask me do I wish to open my digital photos with Open F-Spot.

This code is device specific and Ubuntu uses usb_modeswitch to switch the mode on the modem from key to modem.\nFor the time being to add support for Rogers Nokia CS-18 rocketstick users need to add this to the bottom of /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/0421:0627\n######################################################## \n# Nokia CS-18 \n\nDefaultVendor= 0x0421 \nDefaultProduct=0x0627 \n\nTargetVendor=  0x0421 \nTargetProduct= 0x0612 \n\nCheckSuccess=20 \n\nMessageContent=\"5553424312345678000000000000061b000000020000000000000000000000\"\n\nThen they need to add this to /lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules\n# Nokia CS-18 \nATTRS{idVendor}==\"0421\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0627\", RUN+=\"usb_modeswitch '%b/%k'\"\n\nThat's it!  Unplug and replug your rocket stick and you are ready to go! :)\nHopefully these config file changes will be added to the Ubuntu distribution soon.\n", "Q: XFCE4 Network Manager My standard Kubuntu 10.04 installation works perfectly but now I'm trying the lighter xfce window manager. I can't find any gui tool to configure networks. Someone on the web talks about the gnome applets container but I don't want to use gnome. \nHow to configure network in xfce?\n\nA: XFCE hasn't it owns network manager.Use wicd instead (pygtk-based)\nsudo apt-get install wicd\n\n\nA: Xubuntu 10.04 comes with some GNOME applications such as the Network Manager, just tried on a fresh install:\n\nDon't know what is used in Xubuntu 10.10, but I doubt it's much different. If you're not happy with Network Manager you can always switch to WICD as karthick87 suggested.\n\nA: Xfce's own Airconfig has never lifted off and is currently unreleased, abandoned and unmaintained. As suggested in other answers, Xfce users usually use NetworkManager or Wicd. \n\nA: Still having this issue on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Xubuntu) and the solution is to enable both Notification Area and Indicator Panel to the XFCE panel. This was pointed out in the following post: how to display network manager icon on xfce panel\n", "Q: switch from Netbook Edition 10.10 to Desktop Edition? I installed 10.10 netbook, and want to use the desktop edition. I tried logging in with the desktop edition profile running, but when it loads, there are no panels on top or bottom, so the experience is quite incomplete. How does one get those panels running?\n\nA: Make sure you install the ubuntu-desktop meta-package sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop this will ensure you have all the packages necessary for the base Gnome desktop to run. Once that package is installed you should be able to switch session like normal.\n", "Q: Is Apache server part of default installation? I have a running apache2 server on my computer.\nAs I do not use it as a server, can I remove it safely (to save RAM, boot-up time, etc.) or is it still useful (like part of Ubuntu default installation)?\n\nA: Apache is not part of default Ubuntu installation, you had to install it manually. If you don't use it, you should remove it.\n", "Q: Snippet code manager like Snippets? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCode snippet manager for Ubuntu? \n\nI'm looking some snippets code manager on Ubuntu like Snippets (for the MAC) with syntax highlighting (html, css, php).  Thanks for help.\n\nA: I do not know Snippets, but gedit has code highlighting and is extendible using plugins. You can also add code pieces to it for your own use. \n", "Q: Cannot install build essential from the CD? After a fresh installation of Ubuntu 10.10 I tried to install build-essential from the Ubuntu installation CD. I put the cd in the cdrom and in the software repositories i checked the box install from cd(Ubuntu 10.10 release Maverick Meerkat). \nThen I reloaded the software repositories. The synaptic manager then tried to download some repository related files but failed to do so as i didn't have internet connection. Then I open a terminal and wrote sudo apt-get install build-essential. It prompted me if I want to install build essential y/N. I typed y but the terminal showed some errors and was not installed. I also tried to add the CD in the software repositories. \nI clicked add and it prompted me to insert a CD while the CD was still inside the cdrom. I clicked \"ok\" then and it showed it could not find any cd. \nWhat is wrong?\n\n\nA: You cannot install build-essential from the LiveCD disc because it is not on the disc - very few packages/programs are on the disc other than the default desktop (due to limited space on the CD)\nIf you can't connect to the interest you may like to have a look at How can I install software offline?\n\nA: If you have no internet connection, remove (deselect) all repositories other than the CD. Perform an update and install again. This should install from the CD rather than the internet, and the only software that will be available will be that on the CD.\n", "Q: Security problem with sudo su? By typing sudo su, any sudoer can go into the root prompt & thus change the root password!\nThen what is the use of having a root & then the sudoers , because now sudoers can interfere with the root account!\nDoesn't this sound ODD ??\n\nA: sudo is just a way to become root, similar to login and su. Everyone who can run passwd as root can change root's password, there's nothing special about sudo.\n\nA: No, this isn't odd. This is rather what the /etc/sudoers file and groups are all about.\nBy default, anybody in the admin group can perform any command through sudo as defined by the line:\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nIf you think it odd that users who are noted as admins can do this, comment out that line, or, and perhaps being more sensible, you just remove them from the admin group if you don't trust them as a system admin.\nAdditionally, you can allow only certain commands for certain users or groups through sudo.\n\nA: Did you ran another sudo whatever before ? In this case you won't be asked for the root password.\nOf course you have to be careful with what sudoers are allowed to do !\nThis was already discussed a long time ago by debian users here ;-)\n", "Q: Disk utility running for a long time I had a spare, old external usb hard disk which stopped working long time back due to improper removal of disk. I tried fixing it in windows (when I did not have ubuntu yet), however I couldn't fix it.\nSo I tried formatting the disk and creating a new partition using the disk utility in ubuntu. However it seems to keep running without any indication of the progress or whatsoever. I have no idea what is happening. I have attached a screenshot below to show what I mean.\n\nAs you can from the screenshot above it seems to be working on it but no indication on the progress or what it is doing. Any attempt to exit it or do any other task like safe removal or format partition leads to the the following dialog box.\n\nWhat should I do? Wait or restart the computer..???\nUpdate: I installed gparted as per the answer however when creating the partition of the type ext4 I had the same problem. It ran for hours (I waited around 10 hours) and when I checked it was stuck. The application froze. So I restarted and then deleted the disk and then created a new partition of the type ntfs and it was done in 5 minutes!!\nThe problem seems to be creating a ext4 partition. Any reasons why?\n\nA: Install and use gparted to format the usb-drive. It is safish to simply restart your computer, considering you want to wipe the drive and it was \"broken\" before. Takes about a minute to format 2GB drive.\n\nA: try to remove the disk from the USB enclosure and hook it up directly to an internal port (SATA or PATA) then check S.M.A.R.T. maybe there is a problem with the disk or USB controller itself\n\nA: I know this is an old question but I had the exact same problem. The Disk Utility just carried on for ages without giving me any idea how long it was going to take. \nIn the end I gave up, attached the USB drive to a PC running Windows Vista and formatted it as Ext3 using Paragon Partition Manager 11, job done in under 2 minutes!\n", "Q: Is it recommended to apply the new said-great 200 line Linux kernel patch? Nowadays I'm hearing a lot about the new ~200 line path to Linux kernel that is said makes sensible difference in performance.\nNow, do anyone has experience on applying this path on his Ubuntu kernel?\nI also saw an alternative way that claimed has a better result:\nwget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/59511828/cgroup_patch\nchmod +x cgroup_patch\nsudo ./cgroup_patch\n\nWhat do you think this is? Is this validated?\nI ask this question because I need more performance but I can't risk on stability.\n\nA: The famous \"200 lines patch\" will not improve the performance of your computer. However it may improve your user experience while having your computer heavily loaded : it improves the responsiveness of your desktop.\nYou could find some information at Phoronix. There are also already compiled kernels available for Ubuntu 10.10 here but I recommend NOT testing this patch unless you fully understand what it does and how it works.\nThe patch will probably be included in Ubuntu 11.04, see here.\nThe alternative you present, as far as I know, only apply to processes launched from a terminal.\n\nA: No. The supported method for getting updates is to wait for them to be available via Update Manager (which uses the software repositories) or a new Ubuntu version.\nYou are perfectly free to try this out, but you should know exactly what you are doing.\n\nA: Well after I had applied the patch, I got a huge performance boost to my desktop. But I would still advise you to only use or apply this patch if you know what you are doing!\n\n\n*\n\n*I would go here for a .deb package of with the patch plus more info.\n\n*I personally use this kernel on my system. It has the patch included plus some other tweaks for performance boost!\nOption 2 is a little less stable I would say than option 1.\n\nA: I used the cgroup_patch on Ubuntu 10.10 on a eee pc 1000. I noticed Flash ran better in the Chrome browser. It appeared that less frames were dropping in the video. The UI feels snappier too when I open tabs in Nautilus and switch views. I guess on a system like a netbook where the cpu is pegged a lot you can visibly see the difference.\n\nA: I have used the cgroup_patch, and I have not had any stability problems.  The only time I have rebooted is when I have wanted too. Have I noticed a difference in performance?  I think so, but I don't have the numbers to back it up.  It does definitely seem faster though... \n\nA: I applied the patch to 2.6.36 and to 2.6.37...\nBoth cases worked 'better' but, like others, I don't have the numbers.\nI am running Ubuntu 10.10, and did load the 2.6.38 kernel... \nwhich includes the patch (as mentioned)...\nTHAT is worth the effort. There is soooo much that works better...\n(NOTE: Kids go ahead and try this at home. Older scoundrels... read up on what you are doing, and find some young kid to help,  since Older scoundrels (like me) goof up a lot.Do find a good source, use the .deb's if you can find them, or check out reputable sources and sites.)\nWebUpD8 listed a package at this url:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/03/how-to-install-liquorix-kernel-in.html\nthat I also tried and it worked (Had .38 already installed earlier)\nYou will find the next sudo apt-get update (or sudo apt-fast update if you have apt-fast installed), will cause another kernel update, later.\nAgain, never test things like this, unless you are ready (like having /home on separate partition, so you don't lose it)\nI am an old (oooollllldddd) scoundrel and reload a lot since, I like doing things you shouldn't do at home without kids supervision...hehehe\n", "Q: Problem uploading a file to Ubuntu One using the web interface When I try to upload a file via the Ubuntu One web interface, the server constantly goes down, and it's impossible upload a tiny file.\nAny suggestion as to what is happening?\n\nA: We had some server problems yesterday, and some accounts where affected.\nPlease try again.\n", "Q: Nautilus only starts as root user I am running Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit, and when I attempt to start Nautilus from the command line, it does not appear -- although a PID is generated. As root/sudo i can start Nautilus fine.\nOne note: I run e16 as the windows manager, so I do not use Nautilus to draw my desktop. However, even under this configuration, Nautilus used to run fine as a \"regular\" user.\nThe permissions for Nautilus are the same as the other packages in /usr/bin.

I'm following these tutorials to help me learn to use it.\nBut some of my commands are not working, for example:\nCapital W.\nf followed by a character. (To move to next same char.)\n\nWhy is this happening and how can I get these commands to work?\n\nA: Usually VIM runs in VI compatibility mode by default.\nTry switching modes and see if the commands work. Use this to see which mode you are in:\n:set compatible?\n\nThen \n:set compatible\n\nor \n:set nocompatible \n\nto switch to the other mode and give your commands a try.\nAdding\nset nocompatible\n\nor \nset compatible\n\nto a file called \".vimrc\" in your home directory will make the setting the default for vim.\n\nA: this may be because by default Ubuntu has a cut down version of vim called vim-tiny and many commands don't work in vim-tiny. To get full functionality you need to install vim. You can install vim with following command\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\nTry these commands after installing vim and let me know if you still have problems.\n\nA: I'm not sure of capital W. I dont know what it is supposed to do, it works just like small w, moving to the next word.\nRegarding f followed by a character will move to the character only in the current line. If you want to move to a character else where use / and the character and press enter. ? for reverse. \nI too got confused with f first. \n", "Q: Why does Firefox Return 'Server Not Found', and SeaMonkey Loads URL Perfectly?

I know how to patch and rebuild the package, but there are some things I don't understand very well. \nMy patch is something dangerous and not likely to commit back to the community. So, let me just say, it's a very private patch. But, I want my patch keep working when the Ubuntu packages upgrade. (Should I apt-get source trac and move my patch to the new version of source directory each time the Trac upgrades?)\nI see there is a patch/ directory (many using quilt I guess) in debian/, but I don't know how to use it? Will debuild automatic apply all patches in the patch/ directory? And what about dpkg-buildpackage? Is there some environ variables to control the selection of patches to apply? \n\nA: Read the Patches to Packages section in the Packaging Guide, for a better understanding how it works you should read the entire guide.\n\nA: Even though this is an old question, it is actual still. Thus I'd like to add some up-to-date information to it.\nThe other answer bluntly links to manual whereas it would be helpful to point exactly the necessary information.\nFrom the manual mentioned relevant part is\n\n8.4. Upgrading to New Upstream Versions\nTo upgrade to the new version, you can use bzr merge-upstream command\n\nBut this is Ubuntu-specific.\nAlternatively one can use apt-src. Manual says:\n\n-p, --patch\nTry to patch local changes into new source tree when upgrading. On\nby default, use --no-p to disable.  Configuration Item:\nAPT::Src::Patch.\n\nFor this to work you need to install apt-src, with sudo apt-get install apt-src for instance.\nAnother possibility is to use quilt. Excerpt from paragraph \"5.26. patches/*\" from Debian New Maintainers' Guide follows:\n\nWhen anyone (including yourself) provides a patch foo.patch to the source later, modifying a 3.0 (quilt) source package is quite simple:\n$ dpkg-source -x gentoo_0.9.12.dsc\n$ cd gentoo-0.9.12\n$ dquilt import ../foo.patch\n$ dquilt push\n$ dquilt refresh\n$ dquilt header -e\n... describe patch\n\n", "Q: How can I make a command run once the next time I log in?

Problem is that the \"new file\", actually the updated file with the same name, is no longer published. Pressing the publish button results is a new URL. I now have to mail new URL's and change embedded links, as old URL will result in a failure to find the updated file (or indeed any file).\nI am not sure if it is a bug or a design flaw (maybe intentional?), but it seems strange to me. \n\nA: Right now it depends a lot on how you update the published file. For instance, copying over a published file with another file from outside the published folders works every time. Other scenarios I'd have to test to make sure, but I know some scenarios that would ideally work don't work yet. We will get round to fixing it so it \"just works\" in all the different scenarios, but regrettably not in time for the next release as far as I can tell.\n\nA: Actually I think it's a bit random at the time being. I don't know exactly on what it depends, but I had deferent results while updating a published file, more precisely replacing one by a new version. I used to do it some time ago and, as far as I know, it worked alright, but now I just did it again and had a bad surprise: the link still aims to the former version of the file, while my file browser and the online file browser have the new version. In my browser, I can right-click and \"copy the url\" (the file is meant to be published), which actually leads to the former version. And in the online browser, my file is said not to be published. And no track of the former version here (no \".u1conflict or so on). Thus, I can't even delete it.\nHence my conclusion: it seems still to be buggy, unfortunately :-s\nI don't dare to publish the new file through the online browser, I fear it would give me another link and totally disable the former -broadcasted- one while hopefully I can find in a near future a way to overcome the problem...\nThanks to the developers anyway !\n\nA: A bug is active on Launchpad. I'm very surprised to see that it is open since 2010.\nPlease note that the possibility to publish any file or folder, independently from its path is also available on Dropbox. (See http://www.dropbox.com/help/167)\nI have done some tests of publishing and updating files using Dropbox, everything is fine with them. Any updated file keeps the same url and is published.\nThis confirms to me even more that we have now a competitive problem with Ubuntu One. Is there any chance that we get this solved before 2014?\n", "Q: How do you limit root partition disk access to allow drive to go into standby mode? When there are no users on my system, I would like the hard disk to spindown to low-power state. I realize that this might not be 100% achievable for a straight 24 hours, but it seems reasonable that the system could remain idle for a few hours at a time when it is not in use.\nMy system is headless and running a limited number of services. The primary services are: exim4, mythtv-backend, nfs, samba, cups, apt-cacher-ng\nAssume that drives are already enabled to go into standby mode. Also, its not acceptable to increase the write-back timeout, since my system is not on a UPS.\n\nA: hdparm lets you set the spindown time for a drive (how long period of inactivity \nbefore the disk goes to standby mode) or put it in standby or to sleep.\n# set spindown time for sda drive to 1 min\nsudo hdparm -S 12 /dev/sda \n# set sdb drive to standby mode\nsudo hdparm -y /dev/sdb\n# put sdc drive to sleep\nsudo hdparm -Y /dev/sdc\n# check drive state (active/standby/sleeping)\nsudo hdpam -C /dev/sdc\n\n/etc/hdparm.conf contains hdparm commands to run automatically at bootup. Here's a snippet from mine:\n/dev/sda {\n  # apm 127: Highest performance that allows spindown\n  apm = 127\n  # spindown 120 = 10 min \n  spindown_time = 120\n}\n\nNot all commands work on all hard drive models, you need to experiment.\nlaptop-mode works for non-laptops too, it is meant to let the disk(s) sleep as much as possible.\nPowerTOP is a utility for tracking down unnecessary background activity.\nlesswatts.org has a number of tips on harddrive spindown.\nwrite-back timeout: To the best of my knowledge it is not possible to have the primary disk go idle without a) increasing the write-back timeout and b) disabling syslog sync. \nA workaround could perhaps be to have an SSD as the root disk, as they are fairly low on power anyway?\ntracking activity: It is possible to debug where disk access is coming from according to the laptop-mode FAQ - see 5 Spinup Debugging. \nQuote:\n\nMy disk spins up all the time and I\n  have no clue what causes this. Can I\n  debug this? \nYes, you can. But first,\n  check that you have modified your\n  syslog.conf to not sync, as described\n  in the last question of the previous\n  section. To debug disk activity, you\n  can do:\necho 1 > /proc/sys/vm/block_dump\n(Warning: you must disable syslogd before you do this, \n  or you must make\n  sure that kernel output is not logged.\n  If you forget this, your system may\n  get into a feedback loop, where\n  syslogd causes disk activity, this\n  causes kernel output, and this causes\n  syslogd to do more disk activity,\n  etcetera!)\nThis enables file/disk activity\n  debugging in the kernel. You can read\n  the output using dmesg. When you're\n  done, disable block dump using\necho 0 > /proc/sys/vm/block_dump\n\ndisabling syslogd sync: The laptop-mode FAQ and lesswatts.org refer to /etc/syslog.conf. \nIn recent Ubuntu this file does not exist, instead look for /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf. \nThe syntax is the same - prepend every log file with a dash, like this:\nkern.*              -/var/log/kern.log\n\nThis turns off syncing for the syslog deamon, meaning that the logs will be written to disk at dirty_writeback_centisecs intervals (every 5 sec by default) instead of every time there is new log entry.\n\nA: If you have sufficient RAM you can move temporary filesystems to memory, using tmpfs.\nEdit /etc/fstab and add:\ntmpfs       /tmp        tmpfs   defaults    0   0\ntmpfs       /var/run        tmpfs   defaults    0   0\ntmpfs       /var/lock       tmpfs   defaults    0   0\n\n\nA: mount it with noatime\nmore RAM also helps (bigger buffers and caches)\n\nA: On my laptop I mounted /var/log to a tmpfs ram drive. That gives you far less disk writes but of course any log messages are discarded upon reboot. Something you might not want when you are running services like exim.\ntmpfs           /var/log      tmpfs  defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0\nand in /etc/rc.local\nmkdir /var/log/apt\n", "Q: Video stabilisation software Is there any way, either through a graphical program or a command line utility to \"stabilise\" video in Ubuntu?\nBy stabilise I am referring mainly to a feature of iMovie where shaky video is analysed, and then frame by frame altered to make it look smoother.

Ubuntu Tweak has served me very well over the past few release cycles, but there seems to be more and more of an overlap between Ubuntu Tweak and the Ubuntu Software Center.\nI wanted to know whether these two great apps are headed for a head-to-head crash (which would be a shame for the Ubuntu community) or is there some way for the two projects to complement each other, integrate and make my favorite distribution even better?\nHappy new year to everyone.\n\nA: None. They have different uses.\nUbuntu Tweak is a Management Tool software, which happens to have an menu for installing popular applications. It has menu entrys that allow tweaking windows buttons, cleaning cache and so on. I personally think that Ubuntu Tweak main focus is allowing easy configuration of the system, not installing apps, and this should be the focus of future versions of it. So yeah, I don't think it'll overlap the functionalities of Ubuntu Software Center. \nUbuntu Software Center is a Application Install Software (front-end to apt-get) which allow you to install/remove ANY applications in your computer. I personally think that Ubuntu Software Center focus is to make easier to install/remove/manage software for your system. I think it's headed to archive a experience of a \"Iphone Store\" for the Linux Desktop, which we can see as they are trying to synchronize applications installed on the system and pushing payed apps on the Software Center.\n\nA: I think you simply misunderstand the purpose of both. Ubuntu-tweak is a tool for modifying multiple areas of your system, where as the software center is for managing software. There is no clash here.\nFurthermore Ubuntu-tweak is a 3rd party application.\n", "Q: Laptop Screen does not turn on after sleep I recently put Ubuntu 10.10 on my laptop and after fixing the wireless problem I am only stuck on my screen turning back on after sleep.

When my laptop wakes and I get the blank screen, I press that key combination and I get my display back. I think what happens is that the OS tries to connect to external display but when it cant find one it reverts back to laptops LCD which does the magic and turns it on.

I've had this problem for a long time and can't find a solution.  I switch between the 3 OSes all the time and use a 1TB USB Drive to do so.  I can't seem to find a format that is compatible across all systems that handles large files (at least 8-9 GB).\nDoes anyone have a solution for this?  Recently I've tried exFat but that messes up the filesystem when trying to read on windows after adding files from Ubuntu (using the fuse driver).\nThe OSes currently I'm using are Windows Vista/7, Mac OS X (10.6.5) and Ubuntu 10.10\nupdate: I've decided to go with ntfs for now.  The download for ntfs-3g for mac can be found here.\n\nA: I would go with Ext2 - since there are IFS drivers for Ext2 filesystems on Windows and also for Mac.\n\nA: Have you tried NTFS? You'll need to install driver ntfs-3g for linux (and im not sure about mac) This seems to work fine.\n\nA: A workaround for this problem that requires no reformatting of the flash drive is to use the UNIX/linux split and cat utilities.  The utilities are on all UNIX and linux systems and are in the default cygwin package for Windows.  I don't know what the situation is on the Mac.\nAn example usage is:\nsplit -b 100000000 filename\n\nThat splits up the file into one billion byte chunks that can be copied to the flash drive and recombined at the other end.\nBy default the files are named xaa, xab, xac, xad, and xae.\nTo combine them again:\n    cat xa* > filename\nI've used this often and it works fine.  It leaves your flash drive in a state that will continue to work in any computer you insert it into.\n\nA: I have used Gparted for 8Gb USB flash drive NTFS formatting. It works fine. I am not sure, but I heard that non-FAT format may have influence on a lifespan of USB flash drive (decreasing it :) ).\n\nA: What about just the vanilla vfat?  Isn't that accessible across all OS.  Also, most thumb drive aren't that large.  It's not like the usual FS features like journalling etc would really come in handy.\n\nA: Partition the drive, a partition for your data (exfat, ntfs3g, whatever) and a smaller fat 32, which is fairly universal and load it up with drivers, executables for reading your filesystem on the main partition on the various paltforms you use.\nSo if you are ever caught short, you will hopefully have something to load up from the fat drive to get you through.\n\nA: You can also use exfat. It is Microsoft proprietary filesystem. It does not work under Windows XP and earlier, but it should work on Mac OS 10.6.5 and newer.\nIn Ubuntu it worked under FUSE, but needs installation.\nIn kernel 3.8.11 and later, it should have native support.

I am dying to install it on my PC, alongside the existing Ubuntu 8.04 (from which I write this message right now).\nBut... it won't let me!\nWhen I reach the partitioning stage (manual!)

(yes, I actually managed to install Windows 7 64-bit in dual-boot configuration with Ubuntu 8.04 on this same system).\nNote: GParted on Ubuntu 10.04 (live CD) sees the partition intended for Ubuntu 10.04 (/dev/sda4) perfectly, but is unable to format it.\nNote: I also removed that partition trying to reformat it via GParted once 10.04 LiveCD is loaded. It didn't help.\nI believe that the problem lies in Ubuntu \"deciding for me\" that the HDDs should be \"seen\" as a RAID, hence any partition is seen by GParted as \"busy\" or \"locked\".\nAny idea how to solve this problem?\n\nA: Since the drive was part of a raid configuration at some time, you need to remove the RAID meta-data from the drive. I had to do this with a used drive I purchased. The procedure I followed erases the data on the drive. However, it does work. The raid meta-data should be towards the end of the drive space. This command erases the last 10GB of the drive when run as root, but you should back up your drive to preserve the data you do not want to lose:\nPlease replace /dev/??? with the correct drive, such as /dev/sda\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M seek=150000 skip=150000 of=/dev/???\n\n\nA: Problem solved.

Ive read windows 7-like snap window maximize and vertical feature and http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2009/11/get-aero-snap-in-ubuntu/\nThere are two problems with this solution that I am trying to get around.  \n\n\n*\n\n*It's not sensitive to dragging a window\n\n*It's not intelligent for Twin-view monitors.\n\n\nThe first problem is the more pressing.  I have the compiz settings with wmctrl, but this is not sensitive to dragging windows if I have a window with the focus and place my mouse in the panel I get the window maximized, even though I'm not dragging the window.  A good solution would be sensitive to the state of the mouse, clicked, right clicked, middle clicked.  An ideal solution would be sensitive to dragging a window or not.\nSecond is a minor annoyance to me at least.  With the commands as they are listed are equivalent to maximizing the windows since I have a Twinview monitors setup.\nIs there any way to add these sensitivities to the commands?\n\nA: I wanted this feature on my Ubuntu when i switched from windows7.\nI use the grid component on Compiz, mapped on numeric keyboard, this is really efficient and I know prefer this way to organize windows on my desktop.\n\nA: After fiddling with things for a while a got a solution that works with mouse genstures, following the suggestion from this post. \nI created two scripts one for docking left and one for docking right.\ndockleft:\n#! /usr/bin/env bash\nWIDTH=`xdpyinfo | grep 'dimensions:' | cut -f 2 -d ':' | cut -f 1 -d 'x' `\nHALF=$(($WIDTH/2))\nQUARTER=$(($WIDTH/4)) \nwinid=`xdpyinfo | grep focus | grep -E -o 0x[0-9a-f]+`\nx=`xwininfo -id $winid | grep \"Absolute upper-left X\" | cut -f 2 -d ':'`\ny=`xwininfo -id $winid | grep \"Absolute upper-left Y\" | cut -f 2 -d ':'`\n\nif [ $x -lt $HALF ]; then\n  wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert && wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,0,0,$QUARTER,-1\nelse\n  wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert && wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,$HALF,0,$QUARTER,-1\nfi\n\ndockright:\n#! /usr/bin/env bash\nWIDTH=`xdpyinfo | grep 'dimensions:' | cut -f 2 -d ':' | cut -f 1 -d 'x' `\nHALF=$(($WIDTH/2))\nQUARTER=$(($WIDTH/4)) \nTHREEQUARTERS=$(($WIDTH*3/4))\nwinid=`xdpyinfo | grep focus | grep -E -o 0x[0-9a-f]+`\nx=`xwininfo -id $winid | grep \"Absolute upper-left X\" | cut -f 2 -d ':'`\ny=`xwininfo -id $winid | grep \"Absolute upper-left Y\" | cut -f 2 -d ':'`\n\nif [ $x -lt $HALF ]; then\n  wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert && wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,$QUARTER,0,$QUARTER,-1\nelse\n  wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert && wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,$THREEQUARTERS,0,$QUARTER,-1\nfi\n\nThen I used easystroke to assign mouse gestures for dock left, dock right and maximize.  This does not perfectly emulate the windows version but at least I won't be maximizing my windows automatically.  This way I can also assign the scripts to hotkeys for added convenience.\nNOTE: This is for my Twinview dual monitor setup which takes into account that I want the window docked on the side of the monitor not the 'desktop' which appear to ubuntu as a very wide single monitor. \nThis will probably be sufficient for me but if there is a better solution out there I would really like to hear it.\n\nA: Andrew, I see you already answered with the EasyStroke alternative, but I'll put MY way to do it here, just for registering an alternative.\nIn fact, I kept with the original Compiz alternative, but instead, modified the scripts so they'd work immediately with the window dragging itself, not by waiting a button release. I guess it's a question of personal taste, but like you, I also prefer Win7's way of maximizing on edge touching.\nFor the left and right scripts, I just commented out the loop that waits for the button release:\n#while (/usr/bin/X11/xinput --query-state $MOUSE | grep down)\n#do \n#   echo 'button pressed'\n#done\n\nand nothing more. Well, I also added the keyboard shortcuts for them, but that's just a Compiz bonus. ;-) Congrats for such a good question.\nP.S.: My edit is on the mouse-click-detection version, available on http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9207510&postcount=60.\n", "Q: Install Haskell (hugs) - Package not found I have problems with installing haskell (hugs) on Ubuntu 10.10.

I occasionally have the need to indent a block of text with spaces for use within a web browser, for example, when formatting a code block on this site or in a post on Launchpad.\nSo far I've just done it by hand by copying four spaces to the clipboard and then mashing keys really fast:\n↓, Home, Ctrl+V (repeat)\nWhat is the quickest way to accomplish this?\n\n\n*\n\n*Copying and pasting to another program? (Which?)\n\n*A Firefox or Chrome browser extension?\n\n*A command to directly modify the clipboard contents?\n\n*An auto-typing program?\n\n\nA: You can pipe through a short shell script:\n$ xsel -b | sed 's/^/    /' | xsel -b\n\nThe first xsel -b reads the clipboard, sed adds four spaces (^ matches start-of-line), then the second xsel -b puts it back on the clipboard.  Drop the -b to use the primary selection instead (the middle-click-paste buffer).\nExample:\n# put two lines in the clipboard, \"abc\" and \"123\", for the example\n# the \\n is a newline, and echo adds another newline to the end\n$ echo $'abc\\n123' | xsel -b\n\n\n$ xsel -b | sed 's/^/    /'  # output written to the terminal\n    abc\n    123\n$ xsel -b | sed 's/^/    /' | xsel -b  # again, to the clipboard\n\nYou can put this in a shell script, for example named \"indent4\", with contents:\n#!/bin/bash\nxsel -b | sed 's/^/    /' | xsel -b\n\nThen make it executable.  You can also do the chmod by right-clicking the file in Nautilus, going to properties, and changing permissions.\n$ chmod +x indent4\n\n\n# test it:\n$ echo $'abc\\n123' | xsel -b  # load clipboard\n$ ./indent4                   # assuming it's in the current directory\n$ xsel -b                     # show clipboard\n    abc\n    123\n\nAnd then put the file on your desktop, or store it anywhere and make a launcher for it.  Now you can run indent4 (e.g. double-click) and the clipboard will be modified.\nxsel is from a package named, not surprisingly, \"xsel\"; you may have to install it.  See \"man xsel\" for details.

In (g)vim, the > key in visual mode (i.e., when characters are selected or highlighted) will indent all the selected lines by an amount you set in your .vimrc.  \nThere are ways of setting up pentadactyl to tell gvim what filetype is being edited (e.g., html or markdown for this page, or bbcode for the Ubuntu forums, etc., so you can use filetype-specific plugins and even get syntax highlighting.)\n\nA: THIS is a link to a command submitted to commandlinefu.com.

Hey!\nI have installed hugs on Ubuntu 10.10\nBut now I have the problem how to run it.\nBefore, I mean in later versions of Ubuntu I typed just sudo run hugs and it worked. Now it doesnt work.\nHow should I run hugs in Ubuntu 10.10?\nThanks\n\nA: You can run an interactive haskell interpreter with the hugs command or you can execute a haskell program in a file with the runhugs command - to execute a file called file.hs, enter runhugs file.hs.\neg.\n\nHere I created a simple hello world program (You will probably want to use an actual text editor like Gedit for this; I used cat cause I'm l33t) then tried to run it with hugs but realised that this only launched the interactive session .\nThis may be very useful for you (and it has wonderful ASCII art) but I wanted to execute my haskell file so I consulted the manpage of hugs and found that I needed to use runhugs for this. When I used the runhugs command it executed my program and printed a \"Hello, World!\" message.\nPS\nWhy were you using sudo run hugs? There is no command called run and using sudo to run a programming environment could be very dangerous - it allows you to do anything to your system.

It takes about 30-45 seconds for the wireless to reconnect, and I think it is a driver issue (I clicked on the network manager at the top and for about 30 seconds there are no wireless networks listed.)\nI tried this advice already: http://lilserenity.wordpress.com/2007/10/31/fix-ubuntu-dropping-wireless-on-suspendhibernate-resume/ \nwhich basically says to change this:\nSTOP_SERVICES=\"\"\n\nto\nSTOP_SERVICES=\"networking\"\n\nin the file\n/etc/default/acpi-support\nThis did not help anything. Something to note is that the issue does not occur when I am logging back in after already logging in once and logging out.\n\nA: The following woked for me on an Asus x50N. Cheers\nSTOP_SERVICES=\"\"\nto\nSTOP_SERVICES=\"networking\"\nin the file /etc/default/acpi-support\n\nA: Adding \"networking\" to /etc/default/acpi-support might not be enough.  You might find you get better results by putting the whole network card to sleep.  I have to do so to my bluetooth driver, or the whole laptop fails to resume after suspend.\nGo to your network manager applet, right-click and choose Connection Information.  Note the name of your Driver.  You can confirm this name by opening a terminal and issuing lsmod.  Perhaps grep the result for your driver (eg lsmod | grep sky2) because if anything depends on this, you'll need to tell ACPI to shut that down too.\nThen in /etc/default/acpi-support, add your driver. So the sum total of your edits will be :\nSTOP_SERVICES=\"networking\"\nMODULES=\"sky2 toshiba_bluetooth bluetooth btusb\"\n\nn.b. I use a Toshiba laptop, hence the Toshiba references. Your modules will have to be determined from the output of lsmod outlined above.\nThe order is important, so that networking is stopped first, then the modules are unloaded in the order of sky2 WiFi driver, then the bluetooth drivers.  They are then started in reverse order after a resume.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure this is normal behaviour with all wireless cards in Ubuntu; it does the same with both my Broadcom and Intel cards.\nIf you disable and reenable wireless you will see the same thing - it takes time to initialise the card and for Network Manager to detect the card, then detect the wireless network.\nWhen you log out the card is still active within the system, so all Network Manager has to do when you log in is to scan for networks.\nIf memory serves, Windows 7 does exactly the same thing - it doesn't detect wireless networks immediately after resume (or boot, for that matter).\n\nA: I found a similar issue with Ubuntu 12.04. The above suggested solution does not fix it. The problem appears to be this bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/274405\nThe workaround in comment 74 fixes it for me:\nChange the last part in /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/55NetworkManager\n\nfrom\n  thaw|resume)\n     resume_nm\n\nto\n  thaw|resume)\n    resume_nm\n    sleep 2 && iwlist eth1 scanning &\n\n", "Q: Upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10 on netbook: now or later? I began with installing 9.04 in a netbook (Asus EeePC 1000H), upgraded to 9.10 and have now Lucid Lynx 10.04 (LTS). \nMost things tested run pretty good, with the most notable exception being wireless network due to the hardware (Ralink RT2860) which I first tested after the last major upgrade and a few times before giving up (failed to maintain connection to WPA2 networks). Other nuisances are not as important (e.g. some hotkeys work, a couple of them don't), but given that most everything works I'm concerned with doing an upgrade to find most things have been broken and I have to go back and dig up on how to get it to work...\nOnce in a while, I look up for some posts elsewhere to read up on problems and to find out if they're tame enough to justify an upgrade to 10.10. I'm not in a rush, but I'm not interested in being too left behind some time from now that an upgrade becomes too costly or downright impossible (many things formatted too differently). I'm not even sure if it's possible to \"easily\" upgrade from LTS to LTS release...\nTherefore I ask if it's (in principle) possible to skip releases and only do a major upgrade much later on. For example, is it possible (or advisable) to do an upgrade only when the next LTS comes out (a couple of years from now)? Or is it preferable not to skip releases at all?\n\nA: Normally, it's not recommended to skip a release. However, with LTS releases, you have the option of upgrading when the next LTS comes along, skipping the versions in between.\nSo your options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 (in April 2012)\nor\n\n*Upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10, then Upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 in April 2011\nI don't see any problem for you upgrading to 10.10, if anything goes wrong, you know where to come for help. :-)\n\n\n*\n\n*Generally speaking, things that break between versions (so called Regressions, things that used to work but don't anymore) are treated very seriously in Ubuntu. They are therefore relatively rare.\nIf you do stumple upon one, you also have a good chance of it being fixed in the current release. So long as you file a bug.\n\nA: A couple things to point out.  In 10.10 they changed the user interface drastically for the netbook edition - it's called the Unity desktop.\nAlso, in the 11.04 alpha (which you can install now), the ubuntu netbook edition merged with the desktop edition, see:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/testing/natty/alpha1\nSome folks have already tried it out on their netbooks, see: http://imgur.com/a/OA6Q2\nI'm about to try it on my eee pc's, as well.\n\nA: My personal answer would be to install 10.10 desktop edition, and wait for 11.04 so you can have its Unity interface. The Netbook Edition in 10.10 is slower and have some limitations because unity graphics are powered by Mutter instead of Compiz. It didn't work as expected, so they will change it for 11.04. \nUnity does look great and helps you with screen space, but you will feel it almost \"hangs\" on specific situations. After testing netbook edition, I'm using desktop edition again, but using Docky and tweaking the panels so it looks a little close to Unity.  \nIn 11.04, Unity is based on Docky (Canonical hired its developer) and uses Compiz for graphics. I'm sure it will work flawlessly by its release time.\n", "Q: Easily create slideshow? Does anyone know of an app that lets you drag and drop images to create a slideshow? Not to create a DVD or video, but a slideshow you can control yourself. Office presentation tools is too complicated. It is also important that I can bring the slideshow with me easily from one machine to another.\n\nA: In Ubuntu - using the Image Viewer (eog)*, you can just\n\n\n*\n\n*put all of the Images of your slideshow in one directory\n\n*open the first one\n\n*press F11 to put it into full screen\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit the spacebar to advance to the next one\n\n\nor\n\n*press F5 to have a full screen slideshow that advances automatically\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Edit → Preferences → Slideshow to set the time\n\n\n\nFor this to work, make sure the names of your images are correctly sorted in alphabetical order. You could, for example, name them 01.png, 02.png and so on.\nYou will also want to make sure the images have the correct aspect ratio for your screens.\nAs far as portability is concerned, you can just right click your Slideshow Directory and select \"Compress\" to create an archive, then take it with you on a USB Stick.\n*: It will work the same way if you're using Shotwell.\n\nA: I do not know of an application that will do exactly what you want.\nWhat is available:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications that create non-interactive slideshows (videos or DVDs)\n\n*Photo viewers with a slide show function (As mentioned by Stefano Palazzo)\n\n*Full office suite presentation applications\nI know you didn't want to use a full office suite, but Open Office Impress is really the only application that can do all that you want. it isn't that hard to make a presentation of images. You can drag and drop images from the file manager into the current slide then resize the image to fit the slide. You can quickly create new slides by pressing Alt+I+E.\n\nYou can save this file and take it anywhere. If you don't want to require an office suite on other computers, you can export to a PDF file. You can then use the presentation function of the PDF viewer (F5). Once in presentation mode, use left click to navigate forward, right click to navigate backward, or Esc to exit.\n", "Q: MP3 files cut off in the Ubuntu One Android app I noticed today on my phone (Droid X running Android 2.2.1) that when streaming the Ubuntu One app would skip to the next song before the previous one had finished.\nLooking into it, one of the mp3s downloaded from the server was only 2.5MB instead of 4.2MB as it shows on the server itself via one.ubuntu.com.\nIt's happened with multiple tracks today (I remember it happening once the first time I used the app too but shrugged it off as a glitch).\nThe app itself shows a star on the playlist item indicating the file was downloaded even though it was apparently cut off for some reason, perhaps lack of good cell coverage, or some sort of dropped connection. It seems like the latter may be happening and instead of showing an error or retrying it just stops and shows the download is complete.\n\nA: We are aware of the issue, and will fix it as soon as possible. You can subscribe to the bug on launchpad to stay up to date with the progress we make on this.\n", "Q: How to install Revolution R Enterprise, an rpm, when alien fails? Revolution R Enterprise is available as a red-hat rpm file. Normally I would use alien to install an rpm file as explained in another more generic question about installing rpms , but the instructions for installing this package have an install.py file that I am supposed to execute.\nWhen I ./install.py, I get the following instructions:\n\nrpm: please use alien to install rpm\n  packages on Debian, if you are really\n  sure use --force-debian switch.

Let me state for the record that I'm a total noob when it comes to Hi-Fi sound systems, but I am rather picky about the sound quality. Normally I listen to CD recordings ripped to FLAC in 16/44, but I have several albums that are also ripped from vinyls to FLAC in 24/96. But it seems that I can't tell the difference between 16-bit and 24-bit versions (except for some vinyl noises, of course). That can be due to several reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*my equipment (onboard audio, monitor headphones) isn't good enough to make any difference,\n\n*my system is not playing audio in 24-bit 96 kHz,\n\n*I am physically unable to hear the difference.\n\n\nSo here is my question, how do I tell if my system can play 24-bit sound with 96 or 192 kHz resolution? And if it can, how do I tell that it plays it instead of downsampling to 16-bit / 44 kHz?\nAlso, what hardware (audio cards, amplifiers, etc.) would you recommend to play such recordings on Ubuntu?\n\nA: To find out what your sound card supports, have a look at\n/proc/asound/card0/codec#2\n\n(you can just type cat /proc/asound/card0/codec#2 in a terminal to read it)\nNow, the 0 and the #2 may vary for you, type cat /proc/asound into the terminal and hit tab to see what's there,\nin this file (which isn't really a file, but never mind), you'll find something like this:\n[...]\nNode 0x10 [Audio Output] wcaps 0xc1d: Stereo Amp-Out R/L\n[...]\n  PCM:\n[...]\n    rates [0x560]: 44100 48000 96000 192000\n[...]\n\nAlso, you may be on the safe side typing cat /proc/asound/card0/codec#2 | grep rates and looking at the lowest common denominator, so to speak.\nBut: The DAC (digital to analogue converter), which the sound system really has nothing to do with, may just interpolate the signal, the sound card may even do some false advertising, you have no way of knowing safe from looking at the manufacturers website.\nThe reason for you not hearing a difference (I assert that there is one to be heard, all though that's subject of great debate) is - probably - that the DAC just isn't good enough. It's by far the weakest link (inside your computer).\nAs for your second question: While this of course isn't the place to discuss it, have a look at stuff like the \"ESI Juli@\" or the \"Dr. Dac Nano\", they are reasonably priced and play 192kHz / 96kHz respectively - and they're widely acknowledged to be \"okay\" by the ever picky audiophile community. Also, the best sound chip will do no good if the headphones/speakers/amplifier can't keep up. \n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I stumbled upon it when I was researching similar questions of my own, and in the mean time I found an answer to this particular part of the original question, which hasn't been answered yet:\n\nAnd if it can, how do I tell that it plays it instead of downsampling to 16-bit / 44 kHz?\n\nThe short answer\nIn most cases you can be sure that your system is downsampling your high quality music. By \"most cases\" I mean regular, everyday, normal operating system set-up.\nThe long answer, with a guide on how to verify it on your own\nFirst, some assumptions - let's say your primary sound card is card0 (as in the first answer to this question), and that the standard stereo output (for front speakers) goes to the pcm0p device on that card (which stands for \"PCM device 0, playback\"). In such case, the file you are interested in is the following:\n/proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/sub0/hw_params\nwhere sub0 is a sub-device (more on this in a moment, but when only one sound is being played-back, then sub0 is the sub-device it will be sent to). If no sound is currently being sent to a particular sub-device, then the contents of the corresponding hw_params file will just be closed. So first you need to start a playback of your favourite, high quality sound file (that you know is more than 16bit and/or more than 44kHz) and then look into the hw_params file, checking what is the format and rate stated there. For instance if you know that your sound file uses 24 bits per sample, and you see format: S16_LE (16-bit signed integer, little-endian bit ordering), then you know that it is being downsampled somewhere along the way to your sound card.\nIf you see that your file is being downsampled, and would like to check wich part of your system is responsible (sound server? music player?), then read on.\nFirst a bit more on the sub-devices, as promised. If your sound card supports hardware sound mixing, then the playback device will have multiple sub-devices. If it doesn't support hardware mixing, it will have only one sub-device - sub0. But even if it does have multiple sub-devices, it is rather certain that only sub0 is going to be used. That's because most (all?) modern operating systems use software sound mixing. Ubuntu, for instance, currently uses PulseAudio sound server, which does software mixing before it sends the sound further down the operating system. With hardware mixing, sound from multiple sources (multiple music players, for instance), would go to different sub-devices, and then the sound card would do the mixing in hardware. With software mixing, the sound from all sources goes to the sub0 sub-device. Just something to keep in mind - remember to look at the hw_params file in the correct sub-device.\nBack to the main topic. Since we are talking about Ubuntu, we will stick to its software stack - at the backend of PulseAudio there is ALSA, which is the interface that talks to the hardware drivers, so that PulseAudio can be a fancy, high-level sound server which doesn't bother knowing what hardware it is talking to.\nKnowing all the above, we can start ruling out potential suspects. We can really rule out automatically any sort of music player, as the only thing they do is they just open the sound file, decode it if it is encoded in some format other than PCM, and send the read/decoded content to, for instance, a sound server.\nSo we are left with the layers between the sound card's hardware driver and the music player - ALSA and PulseAudio. It is somewhat difficult to replace ALSA (for testing purposes) with some other sound sub-system (yet doable), but it is fairly easy to temporarily disable PulseAudio, which will force our music player to talk directly to ALSA. In order to achieve this, we execute the following commands from the terminal (as a normal user):\nsystemctl --user stop pulseaudio.socket\nsystemctl --user stop pulseaudio.service\n\nNow you need to restart your music player, start the playback of your music file, and again look into the /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/sub0/hw_params file. And this time you will see the correct values, which proves that, contrary to some opinions floating around the 'net, PulseAudio does downsample the sound.\nI did my testing using a high resolution music file (24bit, 96kHz) that I found on a Sony website (https://helpguide.sony.net/high-res/sample1/v1/en/index.html), played it back in VLC and saw in the hw_params file that the sound card reports that it is being fed with data in S16_LE format, at 48000 rate. Then I've disabled PulseAudio, restarted VLC and played back the same file - this time the hw_params file reported format to be FLOAT_LE (floating point, which by definition is 32-bit, so actually upscaled from 24bit, probably by ALSA), and rate to be 96000 (so exactly what it should be).\nAfter your testing is done, you can re-enable PulseAudio using the following commands:\nsystemctl --user start pulseaudio.service\nsystemctl --user start pulseaudio.socket\n\nEdit:\nPerhaps I should also mentioned the sound card I used for my testing - (partial) output of lspci -v:\n04:00.0 Audio device: Creative Labs EMU20k2 [Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium Series] (rev 03)\n    Subsystem: Creative Labs SB1270 [SoundBlaster X-Fi Titanium HD]\n    Kernel driver in use: snd_ctxfi\n    Kernel modules: snd_ctxfi\n\n", "Q: The best choice of linux file system and software that can be accesed from Windows I am curently having ubuntu and win 7 dual boot and I want to delete my windows 7 and format all my partitions to use a linux file system. But I want to leave a door open in case I have any problems with linux, to be able to acces my linux file system with windows. I know that there are programs that can give you read-write acces to a ext2/3/4 FS (I tested none). I need advice in choosing the right FS, what are the diferences between ext 2/3/4 and what is the best software to do that.\n\nA: Because no single file system is the best in all situations, determining which file system is the best for your application is not always easy.  However, as you will see for yourself, picking the right file system can offer performance gains in excess of 95%.\nLinux File Systems. Why so many?\nThere are three main reasons why there are so many File Systems on Linux:\n* It's open source: effectively everyone owns it.\n* File Systems competing for better performance and or scalability.\n* File Systems allowing for compatibility/portability of existing data (migrations from other systems). \n\nFile System Comparison\nThe following list describes the Linux file system characteristics and indicates when this file system is best used. This list is not exhaustive of all the file systems available in the world, but focuses on those which have appreciable market share or attention in the market today. A detailed comparison of file system features can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems\nEXT2\n* Recommended to move to EXT3\n* Not Journaled\n* POSIX access control \n\nEXT2 file system is the predecessor to the EXT3 file system. EXT2 is not journaled, and hence is not recommended any longer (customers should move to EXT3).\nRecommended Use: USB/Solid State Drives, or any cause where you need high stability with minimal reads/writes.\nEXT3\n* Most popular Linux file system, limited scalability in size and number of files\n* Journaled\n* POSIX extended access control \n\nEXT3 file system is a journaled file system that has the greatest use in Linux today. It is the \"Linux\" File system. It is quite robust and quick, although it does not scale well to large volumes nor a great number of files. Recently a scalability feature was added called htrees, which significantly improved EXT3's scalability. However it is still not as scalable as some of the other file systems listed even with htrees. It scales similar to NTFS with htrees. Without htrees, EXT3 does not handle more than about 5,000 files in a directory.\nRecommended Use: If you have no specific reason for another filesystem, ext3 is an excellent default.\nExt4\nThe most recent in the ext filesystem line, ext4 includes many major improvements over ext3 like larger filesystem support, faster checking, nanosecond timestamps, and verification of the journal through checksums. It’s backward and forward compatible with versions 2 and 3, so you can mount a ext2 or ext3 filesystem as ext4, and the other way around. You may however lose some of the benefits of the newer versions when mounting as the older. Many of the modern Linux distributions now offer ext4 during the install, and some are using it as the default.\nRecommended Use: Ext4 should be stable enough for desktop and server needs. If your distribution offers it as an install choice, it should be a good choice for nearly any usage needs.\nFAT32\n* Most limited file system, but most ubiquitous\n* Not Journaled\n* No access controls \n\nFAT32 is the crudest of the file systems listed. It's popularity is with its widespread use and popularity in the Windows desktop world and that it has made its way into being the file system in flash RAM devices (digital cameras, USB memory sticks, etc.). It has no built in security access control, so is small and works well in these portable and embedded applications. It scales the least of the file systems listed. Most systems have FAT32 compatibility support due to its ubiquity. \nNTFS\n* The Windows file system, best for workgroup shared LAN file serving\n* Journaled\n* Windows access controls (richer than POSIX) \n\nThe Microsoft Windows file system for the Windows NT kernel (Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows 2003). The Linux OpenSource version of this filesystem is only capable of read-only of existing NTFS data. This allows for migration from Windows and access to Windows disks. NTFS includes an ACL model which is not POSIX. The NTFS ACL model is unique to Microsoft, but is a derivative of the Novell NetWare 2.x ACL model. NTFS is the default (and virtually only option) on Windows servers. It includes rich metadata and attribute features. NTFS also supports multiple data streams and ACL rights inheritance since its Windows 2000 implementation. In Windows 2003 R2, Microsoft included a feature called \"Access Based Enumeration\". This is similar to visibility in NSS and NWFS, but is not implemented in the file system layer, but rather as a feature of the CIFS protocol engine in Windows 2003 R2, so this feature is only available when accessing Windows 2003 via the CIFS protocol. \nReiserFS\n* Best performance and scalability when number of files is great and/or files are small\n* Journaled\n* POSIX extended access controls \n\nThe Reiser File System is the default file system in SUSE Linux distributions. Reiser FS was designed to remove the scalability and performance limitations that exist in EXT2 and EXT3 file systems. It scales and performs extremely well on Linux, outscaling EXT3 with htrees. In addition, Reiser was designed to very efficiently use disk space. As a result, it is the best file system on Linux where there are a great number of small files in the file system. As collaboration (email) and many web serving applications have lots of small files, Reiser is best suited for these types of workloads. \nRecommended Use: Interacting with small files on a single core system.\n\nA: The driver from http://www.fs-driver.org/ allows you to read/write to ext2 and 3 on Windows. AFAIK it does not support ext4.\nNot being a filesystem expert, I don't know too much about the differences between ext 2/3/4, but I do know that ext4 is slightly faster, especially on a clean Ubuntu install, and will give you shorter boot times. Ext2 is pretty old, so few systems use it anymore, especially since ext3 is fully backwards compatible with ext2.\nBut to address you're real problem, which is to say \"What if Ubuntu crashes and I can't access any of my files?\", the easiest, most likely to work way would be insert your Ubuntu LiveCD and boot it up, then either repair your existing Ubuntu install, or transfer all the files you need to save into a portable hard drive.\n\nA: Recovering \"linux\" from \"windows\" is not exactly straightforward. Your best bet is to keep a live cd or live usb handy, so if something goes wrong, you can have access to the web, the built in linux tools, and all the filesystem support you should need.\n", "Q: Is init.d \"safe\" enough to use or should i use `runit` or `daemontools` on a server I am looking to deploy my application on a server on which I would have no access in the future.  I would like to have an indication of start-up errors generated by my program in particular and the system in general.\nI have never used any of those supervision tools and wonder what added value those would bring in?\nIs relying on the Debian/Ubuntu built-in init scheme not a good idea?\n\nA: If you will have no access to the server in the future, there should be someone else that is able to monitor the application and the server. No automated solution can solve all possible issues.\nHowever, solutions such as Monit can help a lot in some cases, by automatically restarting your application if for example it crashed or is using too much memory.\nIf your application is very simple and stable, a simple init.d or upstart script to start it on server startup can work.\n", "Q: Different methods to secure eject removable usb drive?

When I dput -f myhost foobar_x.x.x.changes, it successful uploaded the package, but produced the following warnings: \nfoobar has no source override entry\nfoobar has no binary override entry either\n\nHow can I specify the source/binary overrides, and/or just suppress the warnings?\nI'm using mini-dinstall as the backend aptitude repository manager. \n\nA: Disclaimer: I have forgotten how to handle dput correctly and know nothing about mini-dinstall. \nThe overrides file may contain overides for the section and priority fields of Debian packages. A package has these two embedded, but a repository might decide to give different values. For instance, when I upload to Debian, it is not my decision alone whether a package is required or not.\nGenerally, the warning is harmless and can be ignored. The override file is an option for dpkg-scanpackages (which I suppose is used behind the scenes by mini-dinstall as well). The file contains lines of the form\npackage-name priority section\n\n\nA: It seems that the override warning messages are coming from the apt-ftparchive command. This is invoked by mini-dinstall to create the Package and Source files.\nI managed to make apt-ftparchive read a source override file by setting an apt.conf setting. Unfortunately this is global for all users of apt-ftparchive on that machine but I only use it as part of mini-dinstall so it works for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a source override file with appropriate entries. In this example I used /etc/apt/dinstall-src-override but it could be anywhere that is readable by mini-dinstall.\nopencv  optional        graphics\ndigikam optional        graphics        an.other@example.com\n\nThe contents of this file are as per standard Debian guidelines. To save searching the following are useful: Debian FTP Master's override file; Debian Policy allowable \"Sections\"; and Debian Policy allowable package \"Priorities\".\n\n*Configure that apt-ftparchive uses the override file. Create a /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90mini-dinstall-override file with contents\nAPT::FTPArchive::SourceOverride \"/etc/apt/dinstall-src-override\";\n\nWith this setup I no-longer get the override entry warnings. Of course the overrides used should be sensible because they are used in the archive!\n\nA: Just a little tidbit since I'm in the same boat: the file format is documented in deb-override. I haven't found where mini-dinstall (or apt-ftparchive; dpkg-scansources and dpkg-scanpackages weren't involved here) autoloads these from.\n", "Q: How can I get the original contents of applications.menu and settings.menu? I just want to know the exactly original content of these two files: ~/.config/menus/applications.menu and ~/.config/menus/settings.menu. Mine were changed after some alacarte testing and now I want to revert all the changes as in the original state.\nThank you. :)\n\nA: Those files do not exist until you modify them, as only the changes you make are written to the file, overriding the automatically generated defaults.\nIf you want to reset to the default menu contents et al, just remove the files. To be on the safe side, move them some other place first:\nmv ~/.config/menus/applications.menu ~\nmv ~/.config/menus/settings.menu ~\n\nYou now have the backup files in your home directory. If for some reason you want to restore the files to their previous state, you can move them back like so:\nmv ~/applications.menu ~/.config/menus/\nmv ~/settings.menu ~/.config/menus/\n\n\nA: Alternatively and perhaps more simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click the menu applet\n\n*Click Edit Menus\n\n*Click the Revert button in Alacarte (the menu editor that should have loaded).\n\n", "Q: Microsoft OneNote alternative? Is there any program for Linux that has about the same functionality and usability as Microsoft OneNote? At the moment I am checking out Basket (for KDE), that seems to point to the right direction, but still lacks much of the functionality of OneNote and is very buggy unfortunately.\nFor those of you that don't know what OneNote is, here is the first paragraph from the Wikipedia entry:\n\nMicrosoft OneNote (formerly called\n  Microsoft Office OneNote) is a\n  computer program for free-form\n  information gathering and multi-user\n  collaboration. It can gather user's\n  notes (handwritten or typed),\n  drawings, and audio commentaries and\n  share them with other users of\n  Microsoft OneNote over the Internet.\n  The desktop version of OneNote is\n  available for the Microsoft Windows\n  platform.\n\n\nA: KeepNote\n\nThe search for a good onenote alternative has occupied me for many months. Having tried all of the above I have settled for the moment on Keepnote (.org). While not as flashy as Onenote it has some advantages. I sync it to a cloud and as such, all my notes are accessible because they are html :)\n\n\nA: P3X OneNote\nThis, in my opinion comes most close to the original. It is simply a native wrapper for one note web app. There is really not much else to it. If you are dedicated one note user and want to avoid vm or dual boot, then P3X will solve your dilemma of note taking. \n\nA: Zim\n\nZim is a similar note taking application with wiki like features. Zim supports rich text formatting, links between notes and to external resources, inline images and even LaTeX equations. It has a familiar 'notebook' layout with tabs.\nHere is a quick screenshot demonstrating some of the features:\n\nZim is extendible using plugins - such as the LaTeX plugin. There are lots more. Here is the list of default plugins (you may need to install dependencies of some):\n\n*\n\n*Calendar\n\n*Create Note (from command line for keyboard shortcuts etc.)\n\n*Diagram Editor (using graphviz)\n\n*Equation Editor (using LaTeX)\n\n*GNU R Plot Editor\n\n*Insert Screenshot (using scrot)\n\n*Insert Symbol\n\n*Link Map (using graphviz)\n\n*Spell Checker\n\n*Task List\n\n*Tray Icon (actually an application indicator)\n\n*Version Control (using bzr - this should make synchronisation and back up really easy)\n\nThe only feature it seems to be missing is Ubuntu One synchronisation like with Tomboy, however, if you use the default Notes directory (~/Notes), you can synchronise this over Ubuntu One, as your notes as held in files in this folder.\n\nA: Nobody mentioned CherryTree software, which natively runs on Linux. My first impression that this is the most advanced notes taking software on Linux.\nSome key features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Import features from many other notes taking software.\n\n*Cross platform\n\n*Free to use\n\n*Has graphical icons basically for everything (not like 99% of other Linux software that has only drop down menus)\n\n*I've never used, but it looks so fancy to me. Getting close to OneNote.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: OneNote - Office Web Apps\nOneNote is awesome, and no, there isn't a compatible version for Linux. BUT you can use Office Web Apps which is almost as awesome as OneNote :)\nYou need a Microsoft Live account to use it.\nIt is a Web App so it runs in a browser and works flawlessly from Ubuntu too :)\nI know it is still Microsoft piece of work, but if one likes OneNote then should use OneNote.\n\n\nA: Task Coach - Your friendly task manager\nTask Coach is a simple open source todo manager to keep track of personal tasks and todo lists. It grew out of a frustration that most task managers do not provide facilities for composite tasks. Often, tasks and other things todo consist of several activities. Task Coach is designed to deal with composite tasks. In addition, it offers effort tracking, categories, and notes. Task Coach is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, and iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nMore Screenshots can be found here.\n\nA: Tomboy\n\nTomboy is syncing fine via Ubuntu One. You can install Ubuntu One and Tomboy on your Windows, set up your account and sync in both directions. There is also an app for iPhone called webNotes syncing your Tomboy notes.\nDownload Tomboy:\nhttp://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/download.html\nDownload Ubuntu One:\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/downloads/\nwebNotes for iOS:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webnotes-powered-by-ubuntu/id519580240?mt=8\n\n\nA: Boostnote!\nIt's very similar to OneNote with the difference, that it allows to store code snippets (colors the syntax etc, recognizes zilions of languages). Additionally you write all notes in the Markdown, so it's cool. The only problem is that they don't have their own cloud for syncing, so you can just save your data in any Dropbox folder or other cloud thing. And the data is not encrypted like for example in Simplenote\n\nA: I recommend Evernote. A really good notebook, you are not dependent on a specific device. Use it on smart phone, tablet, Linux.... it will also automatically synchronize. \n\nA: Basket Note Pads\n\nI've always liked Basket. It's not as nice or polished as OneNote, but it lets you organize things hierarchically, group things together, embed media...etc.\nIt worked beautifully for me when I was in school.\n\n\nA: Nixnote\nI use Evernote.  Sign up for a free or paid account on the website, then download the Nixnote client software.  \n\nIt supports multiple clients (PC, Mac, Android, iDevice, Web), tagging, sharing, searching, rich text, inline attachments (pictures, music) and crucially (for me) To Do items.  That way, I know from a meeting note if I have any actions outstanding, even weeks afterwards, because when I click on my saved search \"To Do\", it pops up all the notes that have uncompleted actions.\nThe collaboration element from OneNote isn't there, but I don't have any need for that anyway.  I personally believe OneNote is overpriced and as usual for Microsoft, single-client only (although they support a web interface now).  Also, it looks like the 2010 version is only available as part of 2010, while the 2007 was available stand alone for £80 retail.\nHere's a picture of Nixnote in action.\n\nUpdates\n\n\n*\n\n*Nixnote used to be called Nevernote.\n\n*Also worth checking out the excellent, native client Everpad.\n\n\nA: RedNotebook\n\n\nRedNotebook is a graphical diary and journal helping you keep track of notes and thoughts. It includes a calendar navigation, customizable templates, export functionality and word clouds. You can also format, tag and search your entries.\n\n\n\n\nA: Short answer: nothing comes close to OneNote in terms of interface.\nLong answer: Run it in a virtual machine (for example, using VirtualBox), or in Wine. If I remember correctly Office 2007 (including OneNote) runs fine with recent versions of Wine.\n\nA: FreeMind\n\nNot strictly the same (but seeing as other answers have moved the goalposts slightly...). It's a very good quick note-taking and planning application. All my planning is now done using this as it's very quick to build up areas of detail, moving back and forth in a non-linear fashion.\n\n\nA: I've been using MS OneNote for years now for business and private purposes as well.\nNow I tried ALL of the above mentioned alternative apps, but I must say, honestly really nothing comes close to OneNote.\nThe only one which is at least somewhat close is Basket Note Pads which is available for download from the Ubuntu Software Center or the developer's website: http://basket.kde.org/\nIf you do not want to sacrifice most of the functions you love in OneNote than you need to install it somehow in Wine or PlayonLinux or in a WM...\nReasoning: In which linux note app can you click anywhere in the note and instert any type of object, files, text, drawings etc or edit them? Or which provides automatic cloud sync as well? Which allows you to make freehand drawings or use drawing tools? Which allows you to draw directly on top of any graphical elements, pics etc by hand? How about direct pdf or html or jpg saving of notes? Any linux note app supports the use of stylus pens on touchscreen? Any with image to text conversion feature or OCR, scanning etc? Drag and drop of any elements within or in between notes/notebooks? One click open new tab like note/notebook management with color codes and drag and drop? And so on the list is endless. OneNote Rulez every note app for linux. Unfortunately! \n\nA: I have tried all the other software recommendations, and frankly none fit the job as @Jonathon said. Their respective UIs are usually quite poor, and none do the fundamental thing which OneNote does. Sections with contained categories, essential when you want all notes in one place.\nIt is expensive, text only, and you'd have to use Wine to run it, but I'd recommend CintaNotes. The WineHQ AppDB lists CintaNotes as running against an extremely old version of Wine.\n\n\nA: You can use Dropbox + cron + git + Bitbucket.org for free versioning\n", "Q: Should I choose 10.04 LTS or 10.10? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat's the difference between a Long Term Support Release and a Normal Release? \n\nI'm new to Ubuntu (and Linux) but I want to give it a go. I've spent a few evenings trying to get 10.10 to run but I think my nVidia 8400 GS is causing trouble; only recovery mode with failsafeX gets me to the desktop (low-res but seems to be fully functional otherwise). \nGiven that the xx.04 vesions are long-term support, I'm wondering whether it would be smarter for me to use that. I don't need to be on the cutting edge - I prefer to have a system that just works, long-term. Later I hope to move my media center and wife's netbook over too.\nQuestion:\nWhy should I (not?) choose the 10.04 LTS version over the newest 10.10 version?\n\nA: You said so yourself:\n\nI don't need to be on the cutting edge - I prefer to have a system that just works, long-term.\n\nIn my humble opinion, Ubuntu 10.10 is an amazing release with a lot of cool stuff planned for 11.04 next, however, it also makes a lot more sense to go from LTS to LTS. What works for you in 10.04 will always work for you until the end of life. Stay will 10.04 until your curiosity overwhelms or you have a particular feature you know you need from a newer release.\n\nA: Welcome to Ubuntu the OS and it's underlying community! First off 10.10 isn't cutting edge - it's a bonafide release. Cutting edge would be running the current Alpha which is 11.04. You can find out more with What's the difference between a Long Term Support Release and a Normal Release?.\nUbuntu does a really good job of keeping all it's \"supported\" releases up-to-date. 10.04 will simply be supported longer for security updates than 10.10 - However, for all intents and purposes 10.10 is the current release. 10.04 is the current LTS, and 11.04 is the current Alpha (soon beta, then sometime in April current). The way I look at releases. If I'm installing Ubuntu on a computer I always reach for current unless this is a server or a machine that needs to remain stable due to it's functionality. Normal desktop/laptop machines though - current. The upgrade process from Release to Release point has become very streamlined.\nPersonally, I run at least one machine with LTS only - I like to think of it as my fallback. I rarely do any hardware modifications to it and I always need it to \"just work\". It also negates the task of needing to perform upgrades on it every 6 months.\nHowever, I don't think using 10.04 is going to address your video issue. In fact I think that's entirely independent of what version you're using and may merit a new question in order to address that concern.\n\nA: It really depends what you want to do with it.  LTS is built for stability.  If you're concerned, you should use LTS.  If you just want to see the latest shiniest new things that are coming out, I would update to the latest one.  I've never really stuck to LTS for any long period of time, but I'm a chronic updater.  I tend to be on betas when they come out.\n", "Q: Wireless internet security I have just installed Ubuntu 10.10 (dual booted with Windows 7) on a laptop which will connect to the internet through a wireless internet connection and I want to ensure that this is secure. I have installed GUFW and enabled the UFW firewall and set incoming to deny. What else can I do to secure this laptop? \n\nA: *\n\n*Keep your installation updated: Even Linux programs will have security issues ocassionally, so make sure you periodically install all suggested updates for your system. \n\n*don't install packages you don't need: What isn't there on your system can't have security risks. This is especially true for daemons/server of any kind. I.e. if you don't need a webserver, uninstall apache. Ubuntu doesn't come with those by default but if you added one, consider removing it.\n\n*consider disabling Flash and Java plugins for your browser: Of course if you need one of those, you'll have to leave it enabled. Make sure you update the plugins, then. However, if you don't need e.g. a Java plugin in your browser, consider removing icedtea6-plugin, sun-java6-plugin and the likes\n\n*filter your internet: there are many browser extensions that help you filter the internet from stuff you don't need and can carry security issues\n\n\n*\n\n*Flahblock Addon (xul-ext-flashblock )\ndisables auto-play for flash applications. Flash apps are replaced by a \"play\" button that starts the app on click. Also, it allows to whitelist sites like youtube or hulu, when you're sure they pose no thread\n\n*Adblock Plus (xul-ext-adblock-plus ) filters website ads that often don't come from the original site but from third parties that may not be as trustworthy as the original site you're visiting. However, if you trust a site and want to support it by viewing ads, it allows whitelisting known good sites.\n\n*NoScript disables JavaScript everywhere you don't whitelist, helping keep you safe from JavaScript exploits or some XSS-Attacks\n\n\n*don't run stuff you don't trust: not only executable files are dangerous. Recently, PDF files could include security risks, too. Those are mostly designed for the original Adobe Reader, however standard caution is still useful when opening files from untrusted sources\n\n*don't add random PPAs or install random packages: Addins PPAs or installing packages from website might be a huge convenience when installing programs that are not included in Ubuntu sources (or just plain old), however keep in mind that third party-repositories not only are able to install malicious software through updates, but that the installation process usually runs as root, which includes any scripts included in the installation package. Only add PPAs and packages from a trusted source, if you must have them.\n\n*keep your laptop physically secure: This one depends on what kind of security you wish to achieve. Consider buying a hardware chain and lock (Kensington Lock) so your hardware can't be stolen. As a basic precaution, lock your screen when you leave the laptop for longer than a few seconds by clicking the power-off button top right and selecting lock screen.\n\n*Encrypt your data: if you travel with sensitive data, consider encrypting your data. When installing Ubuntu or adding a new user, there is a checkbox that says Encrypt my home directory. This encrypts your home directory and protects its contents when your device is off. Keep in mind, however, that as long as the laptop is running, files are not protected and accessible.\n\n\nA: That's pretty much all you need.  By default, no \"server\" services run on Ubuntu, so technically even starting ufw (using gufw) is overkill.  Obviously if you later configure services, then these should be ideally firewall protected so that only your desired clients can see them.\nHaving said that, you still want to ensure that your wireless connection is properly protected (which isn't really Ubuntu specific but I'll add it here for completeness):\nGo to the network manager applet, right click and choose Connection Information.  Highlight your wireless network, then check the Security :\n\nThat should say either WPA/WPA2 or WEP.  If it's Open, then you have to reconfigure your router, then reconnect your laptop with the proper key.\n\nA: The problem is not the security of the laptop (incoming ports etc) you've taken care of those. The problem is that wifi is inherently insecure by the nature of you broadcasting all your information for a 30 foot radius.\nAlways use ssl/https, always ensure you're using an encrypted WPA2 network (not WEP) and plug in via ethernet if you really want to make sure.\n\nA: Get rid of Windows 7?\nMore seriously, always use SSL websites (https://) where possible and install some security/privacy-related extensions in Firefox, e.g. NoScript, Adblock Plus, Better Privacy, Cookie Monster, Ghostery, HTTPS-Anywhere, Passwordmaker.\n\nA: As mentioned previously, go with protected wireless, using WPA/WPA2, avoiding WEP or open wireless. Also, avoid unknown applications, or those that have not been reviewed first. Anything you do on the internet today should all be encrypted using SSH/HTTPS. Although Ubuntu is not installing services by default, this is something that a local Linux guru should check to make sure nothing that you don't know is running. There also may be services for things such as Bluetooth, Eudora or other end-user services that you don't need. The less programs you run, the better/safer you are. For example, Ubuntu is known to run an email agent of some kind for checking your email, regardless of the email software you use. I usually disable half a dozen of such services on my installation, before starting to really use it. \n", "Q: Why is this bypassing the SUDO password? I have a bash script I am using to automate a SVN checkout. The contents of the file were:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /var/www-cake\nsudo svn checkout file:///usr/local/svn/bash_repo/repo/\n\nThen when I double click the file it would ask me what to do, I would click the button \"Run In Terminal\" and then a terminal would pop up and ask me for the SUDO password. I would enter it, the script would execute and the terminal would close.\nI wanted to give some sort of indication that the script ran successfully so I edited my file to look like:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /var/www-cake\nsudo svn checkout file:///usr/local/svn/bash_repo/repo/\necho \"Head revision has been pushed to live server\"\n\nI expected the terminal to now stay open and tell me the message afterwards. To my surprise it now opens and immediately closes. The script does execute and I no longer have to put in the SUDO password.\nIs this right? I do not understand why this is happening, seems like a security issue.\n\nA: What happens when you run the script directly from the terminal? Typically if the sudo password has been typed once it's remembered for 15 minutes. If you run it graphically the terminal prompt will close after a complete execution. I don't have an SVN repo to play with - however, I did a similar test which will gather input from a user and touch a file by that name.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\necho -n \"Hello, enter the file name: \"\nread NAME\ntouch $NAME\necho \"All done\"\n\nWhen executed from the terminal:\n\nThen double clicked:\n\n\nThe prompt closes when complete but does what is requested.\n\nA: To keep the prompt open after executing a script, you can try two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the read command as the last line.\n\n*To create a launcher that executes a command in terminal and keeps the window open, create a profile for gnome-terminal, say Hold, that does exactly that (look through the profile options) and use the following. \ngnome-terminal --window-with-profile=\"Hold\" -e \"/path/to/script\"\n\n\nA: sudo remembers your password for some time (15 minutes by default). You can make sudo to forget the password by running sudo -k\n", "Q: Is there an app which links memo-notes to a window, based on the window's title?

It sounds like you're trying to access your own machine instead of the router.\nMake sure you're accessing the default route ip address and not your own ip address. Example:\n\nYou can get to this by right clicking on the network icon and clicking \"Connection Information\"\n\nA: Is this a modem, or a router?\nIn most DSL setups, the modem and the router are NOT the same device.  Typically, the modem is just the gateway to the internet and provides you with an IP address, however the modem needs some other device to GET the IP.  Are you certain that your modem is also a router?\n\nA: You don't say what is your IP and your modem's local IP, which will be useful to know as said by @Martin Owens -doctormo-\nIf your modem's IP were crashing against your computer's IP, you shouldn't have internet connection.\nNow, what you are experiencing is a conflict with port 80 redirection. Which can be solved in an easy way but it requires you to know how to edit your redirections in order to make them call the appropiate port in your computer.\nYou can change what port is your computer's apache service listening to by dropping the next in a terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/apache2/ports.conf\n\nThis will open a file whose contents should look like this:\n# If you just change the port or add more ports here, you will likely also\n# have to change the VirtualHost statement in\n# /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default\n# This is also true if you have upgraded from before 2.2.9-3 (i.e. from\n# Debian etch). See /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/NEWS.Debian.gz and\n# README.Debian.gz\n\nNameVirtualHost *:80 \nListen 80\n\n<IfModule mod_ssl.c>\n    # If you add NameVirtualHost *:443 here, you will also have to change\n    # the VirtualHost statement in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl\n    # to <VirtualHost *:443>\n    # Server Name Indication for SSL named virtual hosts is currently not\n    # supported by MSIE on Windows XP.\n    Listen 443 </IfModule>\n\n<IfModule mod_gnutls.c>\n    Listen 443 </IfModule>\n\nJust change the line that reads: \nListen: 80\n\nfor the port number that you wish and let's see if this fixes the problem. If it does, you will have access again to your modem.\nNevertheless, changing the port from this file will make your http service unreachable in the net. Then, now, if you are having access to your modem, let's change the NAT table in order to make all the petitions made to port 8080, run into the port 80 of your computer.\nWhen this rules are set, now you can return the Listen: 80 back in your ports.conf file.\nI know this information may not be fully clear. But if you wish I can add further information. Just first perform this test and let's see what happens.\nThe results of this in your computer/modem may change my answer or delete it if this is not useful for you.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to close ports / disable services? I just portscanned my system with nmap and got the following result:\nPORT    STATE SERVICE\n25/tcp  open  smtp\n631/tcp open  ipp\n\nwhat are these services and how i do disable them? probably i don't need them.\n\nA: Your best bet generally is to run a firewall from day one -\nsudo ufw enable\n\n\n\n*\n\n*which will block all inbound traffic by default.  This gives peace of mind that if you install something that silently opens ports on your system (such as enabling network printing), then you're still protected generally.\n\n\nConversely, this will mean that you will install services, forget a firewall is running and wonder why nothing is working!\nAdd smtp by simply typing sudo ufw allow in smtp (for example).  Do man ufw for further useful examples.\nYou can also modify the firewall graphically :\nsudo apt-get install gufw\n\nthen run the firewall manager from System/Administration/Firewall.\n\n\nA: Port 25 is, as your post already says, SMTP. This means there is a mailserver installed and listening to requests on your port 25. This is quite unusual on a desktop computer, propably happened accidentaly while installing another program that sends emails.\nPort 631 is the port for CUPS, the printer driver software. This is quite usual as it comes with the default installation. If you configure your computer for sharing printers, port 631 will always be open to the other computers, so they can use the printer.\nIf you want to find out, which exact program is responsible for an open port, type:\nsudo fuser -v 25/tcp\n\nreplacing 25 in the example with your desired port. This should tell you which program is running. \nFrom then on, you have several possibilities. First, you can just uninstall the corresponding program, in this case the mailserver that's running. Second, if you want to keep the program, you could try just stopping the service, like so:\nsudo stop exim4\n\nPlease note that YMMV here, as different programs use different filenames for their services and could be started in a totally different way. \nAlso, please note that scanning your computer from itself will reveal ports that are open only on localhost. Those are closed to the outside but need to be open to localhost, like Cups. This does not pose a security risk.\n\nA: Those two services are your cups service for printer management and printing over the network. Did you enable network printing or did you find this was the case by default?\n\nA: If you don't need a certain service just uninstall it, so it can't be re-enabled in the background or use an outgoing connection.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge exim4 cups-daemon brltty\n\nexim4 removes support for outgoing mail (just use the smtp of your isp), cups-daemon removes printing support and brltty is only usefull for people with impaired vision.\nYou can also install bum (BootUp-Manager), maybe you find some more services you want to disable ... I don't have a scanner for example!\nsudo apt-get install bum\n\nBlocking unused services with a firewall is a waste of resources.\n", "Q: How to access USB in VirtualBox running Windows XP as guest OS I have installed Virtual Box: Host OS Ubuntu 10.10 - Guest OS Windows XP. No problem so far.How can I access USB devices (scaners, printer, and others) from the guest os, windows XP.If this is not possible in the open source version maybe there is another virtualisation software program.\n\nA: If you've installed the VirtualBox version from the repositories, then this is the \"OSE\" or \"Open Source Edition\" and it doesn't support either USB connections or built-in RDP support on guest OS's.\nYou need to install VirtualBox from the Oracle site directly in order to have access to USB connections.\nBrowse to http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads in order to download the appropriate .deb file.  Double click on it to install it via Software Centre.\nFor USB support, you'll also need the \"VirtualBox 4.0 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack\".  Download it to your hard disk.  Once you've installed VirtualBox 4.0, open it, then choose File/Preferences and click on \"Extensions\".  Hit the Add, button, then open the file you downloaded.\nAlternatively, you can keep up to date with the latest VirutalBox by adding their repository to your system by doing the following :\n\n\n*\n\n*Open synaptic, choose menu Settings/Repositories, click on other, then \"add\" and paste in the line :\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian maverick contrib\n\n\n*Then download the Oracle respository key, and add it with the line :\nwget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -\n\n\n*Finally, purge the existing OSE edition, then update your respository list and install the new version :\nsudo apt-get purge virtualbox-ose\nsudo apt-get update\n\n(at this point, you'll likely get errors about a malformed release - simply pop into Synaptic, following step 1, then untick the \"Source Code\" entry for Virtualbox).\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.0\n\n(you'll be prompted to download libhal1 and dkms - accept this to proceed)\n\nA: Run these commands: \nVBoxManage list usbhost ## command 1 \nVBoxManage list vms ## command 2\n\nWith the information from these two commands, run the following:\nVBoxManage usbfilter add 0 -target <vmsnumber> -name <[0000]> -action hold -active yes -vendorid <0x0000> -productid <0x0000>\n\nreplacing the <> items with their respective values from the commands 1 & 2.

I've inherited a huge joomla website (hundreds of nested folders and thousands of files.) I need to be able to find a specific piece of code, but have no idea which file it's in. Is there a GUI FTP client that has an integrated grep-type function?\n\nA: you can mount the ftp resource as a local \ncurlftpfs [user@]host:[dir] mountpoint [options]\n\nand search with your favorite tools\n\nA: *\n\n*You can use nautilus to connect to the server.\n\n*Goto Places → Connect to server → ftp\n\n\n*After connecting to it,you can see it in your nautilus.\n\n*You can search it like any other filesystem you can access. \n\n\nA: Like karthick87 wrote, I generally use Nautilus to mount all my network shares. I have the nautilus-open-terminal package installed, which allows me to right click the window and open a terminal. To search for text, I just open a local terminal from Nautilus and run\ngrep -r '#include <example.h>' *\n\n\nA: I think the question was sort of missed. It boils down to this. FTP only transfers files. If all you have is FTP access you will need to download all the files and search them with your favorite search tool.\n\nA: Any way of full-text search via pure FTP would involve first downloading applicable files as whole, then browsing through them. So be simple: create local mirror of FTP and search through it.

An external 3½\" HDD seems to be in danger of failing — it's making ticking sounds when idle.\nI've acquired a replacement drive, and want to know the best strategy to get the data off of the dubious drive with the best chance of saving as much as possible.\nThere are some directories that are more important than others.  However, I'm guessing that picking and choosing directories is going to reduce my chances of saving the whole thing.  I would also have to mount it, dump a file listing, and then unmount it in order to be able to effectively prioritize directories.  Adding in the fact that it's time-consuming to do this, I'm leaning away from this approach.\nI've considered just using dd, but I'm not sure how it would handle read errors or other problems that might prevent only certain parts of the data from being rescued, or which could be overcome with some retries, but not so many that they endanger other parts of the drive from being saved.  I guess ideally it would do a single pass to get as much as possible and then go back to retry anything that was missed due to errors.\nIs it possible that copying more slowly — e.g. pausing every x MB/GB — would be better than just running the operation full tilt, for example to avoid any overheating issues?\nFor the \"where is your backup\" crowd: this actually is my backup drive, but it also contains some non-critical and bulky stuff, like music, that aren't backups, i.e. aren't backed up.\nThe drive has not exhibited any clear signs of failure other than this somewhat ominous sound.

Unfortunately, it isn't activated for programs with GUI that are started as root user and some other other certain programs like gufw. When I start gufw by command-line not as root, it uses an old, not very attractive theme.\nFor example, gufw gives the following output from the command-line:\n/usr/share/themes/Finery/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:365: error: unexpected number `0', expected number (float)\n/usr/share/themes/Finery/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:365: error: unexpected number `0', expected number (float)\n\nWhat could be the reason for this issue? Is there a way to enable this theme for these other programs?\n\nA: Do a\n$ sudo ln -s ~/.themes /root\nThis symlinks your theme directory so it can be used by the superuser account.

I read about how to enable and disable services in Ubuntu and it seems that there are different possibilities to manage them.\nThe first method I found is update-rc.d to add new services to startup, which aims on the /etc/init.d folder and its contents.\nThe other one I found is to edit .conf files in the /etc/init folder.\nWhat's the recommended way to enable / disable / add services and why?\nCould you please give a short bulletproof step by step example on how to add a service in Ubuntu and enable and disable it?\n\nA: There are services that can be enabled/disabled using the GUI (like the startup application) or the terminal.\nFor the Terminal you have several options. First, open a terminal (Type \"terminal\" in the dash, for example, and open it). Then:\nTemporary enabling/disabling services\nTo stop and start services temporarily (Does not enable / disable them for future boots), you can type service SERVICE_NAME [action]. For example:\n\n*\n\n*sudo service apache2 stop: Will STOP the Apache service until Reboot or until you start it again.\n\n*sudo service apache2 start: Will START the Apache service assuming it was stopped before.\n\n*service apache2 status: Will tell you the STATUS of the service, if it is either enabled/running of disabled/NOT running.\n\n*sudo service apache2 restart: Will RESTART the service. This is most commonly used when you have changed, a config file. In this case, if you changed either a PHP configuration or an Apache configuration. Restart will save you from having to stop/start with 2 command lines\n\n*service apache2: In this case, since you did not mention the ACTION to execute for the service, it will show you all options available for that specific service. This aspect varies depending on the service, for example, with MySQL it would only mention that it is missing a parameter. For other services like networking service it would mention the small list of all options available.\n\nSystemd\nStarting with Ubuntu 15.04, Upstart will be deprecated in favor of Systemd. With Systemd to manage the services we can do the following (through the systemctl action SERVICE pattern):\n\n*\n\n*sudo systemctl start SERVICE: Use it to start a service. Does not persist after reboot\n\n*sudo systemctl stop SERVICE: Use it to stop a service. Does not persist after reboot\n\n*sudo systemctl restart SERVICE: Use it to restart a service\n\n*sudo systemctl reload SERVICE: If the service supports it, it will reload the config files related to it without interrupting any process that is using the service.\n\n*systemctl status SERVICE: Shows the status of a service. Tells whether a service is currently running.\n\n*sudo systemctl enable SERVICE: Turns the service on, on the next reboot or on the next start event. It persists after reboot.\n\n*sudo systemctl disable SERVICE: Turns the service off on the next reboot or on the next stop event. It persists after reboot.\n\n*systemctl is-enabled SERVICE: Check if a service is currently configured to start or not on the next reboot.\n\n*systemctl is-active SERVICE: Check if a service is currently active.\n\n*systemctl show SERVICE: Show all the information about the service.\n\n*sudo systemctl mask SERVICE: Completely disable a service by linking it to /dev/null; you cannot start the service manually or enable the service.\n\n*sudo systemctl unmask SERVICE: Removes the link to /dev/null and restores the ability to enable and or manually start the service.\n\nUpstart (Deprecated Since 15.04)\nIf we want to use the official Upstart way (Note that, for the moment, not all services have been converted to Upstart), we could use the following commands:\nstatus SERVICE - This will tell us if a converted service is running or not. Note that this is deprecated in favor of start, stop, status & restart. It will also tell us if a service has not yet been converted to upstart:\nA converted service would typically output the current status (Starting, Running, Stopping...) and process ID. A non converted service would give an error about an unknown job.\nSome shortcuts may only work with the service command above but not with the commands below unless they are 100% converted to upstart services:\n\n*\n\n*sudo start mysql: Start\n\n*sudo stop mysql: Stop\n\n*sudo restart mysql: Restart\n\n*sudo status smbd: Status\n\nEnabling / Disabling a service\nTo toggle a service from starting or stopping permanently you would need to:\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/SERVICE.override\n\nwhere the stanza manual will stop Upstart from automatically loading the service on next boot. Any service with the .override ending will take precedence over the original service file. You will only be able to start the service manually afterwards. If you do not want this then simply delete the .override.\nFor example:\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override\n\nWill put the MySQL service into manual mode. If you do not want this, afterwards you can simply do\nsudo rm /etc/init/mysql.override\n\nand Reboot for the service to start automatically again. Of course to enable a service, the most common way is by installing it. If you install Apache, Nginx, MySQL or others, they automatically start upon finishing installation and will start every time the computer boots. Disabling, as mentioned above, will make use of the service manual.\n\nA: There is also the Boot-Up Manager.\nTo install: sudo apt-get install bum\nFurther info: http://www.marzocca.net/linux/bum.html\n\n\nA: Simplest method for me as I use CLI only is update-rc.d.\nTo enable or disble auto-start on reboot etc :\nsudo update-rc.d <daemon|service> <enable|disable>\n\nExample: \nupdate-rc.d spamassassin enable\n\nTo stop or start a daemon or check its status:\nsudo service <daemon|service> <start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload|status>\n\nExample: \nsudo service spamassassin status\n  spamassassin.service - Perl-based spam filter using text analysis\n   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/spamassassin.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-05-21 13:04:10 SAST; 4s ago\n  Process: 1928 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/spamd -d --pidfile=/var/run/spamd.pid $OPTIONS (code=exited, status=0/SUCCES\n Main PID: 1949 (spamd)\n    Tasks: 3 (limit: 2361)\n   CGroup: /system.slice/spamassassin.service\n           ├─1949 /usr/bin/perl -T -w /usr/sbin/spamd -d --pidfile=/var/run/spamd.pid --create-prefs --max-child\n           ├─1951 spamd child\n           └─1952 spamd child`  etc  etc\n\nupdate-rc.d can do a little more than the basic shown above:\nusage: update-rc.d [-f] <basename> remove\n       update-rc.d [-f] <basename> defaults\n       update-rc.d [-f] <basename> defaults-disabled\n       update-rc.d <basename> disable|enable [S|2|3|4|5]\n        -f: force\n\nAs always; you van refer manpage.\n\nA: For those of us who run Ubuntu over ssh, I think the nicest option is rcconf - a text based program: \nsudo apt-get install rcconf\nsudo rcconf\n\n\nNavigate with tab and arrow keys, press spacebar to enable/disable. Changes are persistent across restarts.\nScreenshot borrowed from this blogpost, which also shows sysv-rc-conf - a similar tool that also lets you set the runlevel. (For those who happen to care enough about runlevels to wish to change them :) \nUnfortunately, rcconf doesn't work with upstart (services listed in /etc/init/*), just with the traditional mechanism (ls -l /etc/init.d/* - the ones that are not symbolic links).\nFortunately, many of the services that are relevant when ssh-ing in to a server (Apache, Tomcat, mdadm, boinc-client...) haven't been moved to upstart yet. \n\nA: Currently there are actually three different ways for software to be started as a service in Ubuntu, SysV, Upstart and systemd. A service is defined here as a program run by the system in the background, as opposed to one started and run directly by the user.\nSysV\nThe traditional way to start services in Linux was to place a script in /etc/init.d, and then use the update-rc.d command (or in RedHat based distros, chkconfig) to enable or disable it.\nThis command uses some mildly complicated logic to create symlinks in /etc/rc#.d, that control the order of starting services. If you run ls /etc/rc2.d you can see the order that services will be killed with a file name like K##xxxx and started with file names S##xxxx.  The ## in S##xxxx means a \"start order\" for service xxxx.  Conversely, the ## in K##xxxx means the kill order for service xxxx.\nOne major issue with SysV was that when booting the system, everything had to be done in serial, one thing after another, making system boot times really slow. Attempts were made to parallelize this, but they were haphazard and hard to take full advantage of. This was the main reason that Upstart was created.\nUpstart\nUpstart uses job definition files in /etc/init to define on what events a service should be started. So, while the system is booting, upstart processes various events, and then can start multiple services in parallel. This allows them to fully utilize the resources of the system, for instance, by starting a disk-bound service up while another CPU-bound service runs, or while the network is waiting for a dynamic IP address to be assigned.\nYou can see all of the upstart job files by running ls /etc/init/*.conf\nLet me just stop here and say that if you don't know what a service is, or what it does, DO NOT disable it!\nNot all services have been converted to upstart. While working on the server team at Canonical for the past few months, I've worked on a number of converted job files, and the nicest part is that it allows one to get rid of all the script \"magic\" and just put in a few commands here and there to define exactly how to start the service, and nothing more. But for now, only a handful of traditional network services, like squid and samba, have been converted.\nIs a service upstart-based?\nIn order to figure out if a service is upstart-based, you can run the status command:\nstatus servicename\n\nIf it's an upstart job, it will show this:\n$ status statd\nstatd start/running, process 942\n\nBut if it's not, you'll see something more like this:\n$ status apache2\nstatus: Unknown job: apache2\n\nIn this case, apache2 has not been converted to upstart. So, to disable apache2 you just run\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 disable\nsudo service apache2 stop\n\nDisable services (jobs) in upstart\nUpstart job definitions do not have an update-rc.d command. To disable the job, you need to edit the job file directly to disable it. There are two ways to do this.\nIf you want to still be able to manually start it, then you need to comment out the start on condition. Say you want to install samba, but not have it start automatically. Here is the job file (in natty):\ndescription \"SMB/CIFS File Server\"\nauthor      \"Steve Langasek <steve.langasek@ubuntu.com>\"\n\nstart on local-filesystems\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nrespawn\n\npre-start script\n    RUN_MODE=\"daemons\"\n\n    [ -r /etc/default/samba ] && . /etc/default/samba\n\n    [ \"$RUN_MODE\" = inetd ] && { stop; exit 0; }\n\n    install -o root -g root -m 755 -d /var/run/samba\nend script\n\nexec smbd -F\n\nTo disable samba, you can just put a # in front of the \"start on local-filesystems\". Note that while it won't start back up on boot, you still need to stop it this time with\nsudo service smbd stop\n\nIf, however, you never want samba to start, I'd suggest actually removing the package. If, however, you want it installed, but not startable, you can also do:\nmv /etc/init/smbd.conf /etc/init/smbd.conf.disabled\n\nDisable a service using start/stop stanza (as of 11.04)\nStarting with the version of upstart that will be in 11.04, there is a new keyword that disables the start on and stop on stanzas: manual. So another way to disable the service as of 11.04 is to do:\necho 'manual' | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override\n\n# command from root shell\necho manual >> /etc/init/mysql.override\n\nYou can create an override file to disable a service without editing the job definition at all, by just putting the manual keyword in it.\n\nA: I use Stacer:\n\nStacer is an open source system optimizer and application monitor that helps users to manage entire system with different aspects, its an all in one system utility.\n\nIt shows services and processes also. A complete GUI system toolbox.\n\nA: I found out that up to bionic there is this GUI tool, something like BUM but compatible with Upstart: Jobs-Admin\nsudo apt-get install jobs-admin\n\n\nA: sysv-rc-conf\nTry using sysv-rc-conf\nsudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf\n\nand to start managing the services, execute\nsudo sysv-rc-conf\n\nWhich will bring up interactive window like this\n\nYou can further navigate through pages using Ctrl+n for next page and Ctrl+p for previous page. You can enable and disable services by selecting SPACE on desired runlevels.\nJobs-Admin\nAnother alternate would be  Jobs-Admin by installing through \nsudo apt-get install jobs-admin\n\nWhich also provides GUI like this \n\nFor showing more jobs , you have to tick the Show Protected Jobs from its menu.\nchkconfig\nAnd third option would be chkconfig,\nsudo apt-get install chkconfig\n\nIt can be used via CLI chkconfig, showing list of On/Off jobs.\nAlso we can view system services using chkconfig –list\nServices can be turned on using\nchkconfig <service> on\n\nServices can be turned off using\nchkconfig <service> off\n\nAnd we can even add our own service, using a proper init script with proper headings.\nchkconfig --add <service>\n\nupdate-rc.d\nAnd another option can be referred here update-rc.d , explained briefly here. \nNote that for Ubuntu Server 12.04, update-rc.d is used instead of chkconfig.\n\nA: Editing the existing upstart configuration file (as described above) is not such a good idea. An updated package could provide an updated config, and you'd had to repeat your changes over and over.\nBy taking a look at man 5 init one will find a more appropriate solution: using an override config. Short example: Say we have a service called \"foobar\", so there would be a file called /etc/init/foobar.conf with its upstart configuration. Now you don't want to remove that file, nor to modify it -- but neither you want this service to run? So place an override file next to it: /etc/init/foobar.override, containing (optionally the header with the description and) instead the start on / stop on lines you place a line with one word: manual. This way you tell upstart to basically use the foobar.conf, but override the startup definition to only start that service when manually enforced (via service foobar start in our example).\n", "Q: How to convert rmvb to mp4?

That's why you're having problems.\nHowever you almost certainly don't need to transcode your audio in your specific case anyways (assuming you just want the audio to play at the same quality as the original, and not try tweakings) because the rmvb audio stream is probably already in aac format, which is what you need.\nSo you should simply substitute in your script this bit:\n -acodec libfaac -ab 128kb \n\nfor this:\n-c:a copy\n\nThis will simply copy the audio stream from the rmvb file to the mp4 file, while converting the video stream. The resulting file will work perfectly.\nHowever, if you wish to have your initial settings work exactly as they were laid out, and on Ubuntu, then you'll have to compile FFmpeg from source to add the missing codecs.\nFollow this guide for compiling FFmpeg on Ubuntu:\nhttp://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/wiki/UbuntuCompilationGuide\nHere's a more authoritative explanation for the problem involving libfaac:\nhttp://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/wiki/AACEncodingGuide\n\nA: Used http://us.onlinevideoconverter.com/ and it solved..\n\nA: \nYou can use my dmMediaConverter,a FFMpeg GUI which has a Bulk mode convert.\n\nA: The package you need to install is ffmpeg, if you run \"ffmpeg\" from the terminal it will tell the command to install the package containing the command:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\n\nA: ffmpeg -i input.rmvb -c:a copy output.mp4\n\nWorked for me. \n", "Q: Nautilus won't browse my USB hard drive unless I double click it twice On my laptop, running 10.10, whenever I plug in a thumb drive Nautilus will add an icon on the desktop and open a file manager window with the drive contents. This does not work for my 250Mb external hard drive: the icon is added on the desktop, but no file manager window pops up. Double clicking on the icon just causes some disk activity (on the system drive) and nothing else. Double clicking another time on the icon the file manager eventually opens. At first I thought this was related to nautilus-elementary, but after removing nothing has changed. How do I even start debugging this?\nUpdate: suggestions below got me curious, so I \"Safely removed\" the drive, unplugged it and plugged it in again. This time it would open on the first double click (no automagic file manager window yet, anyway). Doing a quick \"mount\" in a terminal shows my USB drive is mounted as a fuseblock device. I suspect the first ineffective double click could be used to load/start the whole user space filesystem thingie.\nUpdate: from what I can see after a fresh boot the hard disk is mounted as soon as the icon appears on the desktop, the only thing that doesn't work is double-clicking the first time. Right-clicking the drive and chosing \"Open\" always works the first time, seems like \"Open\" is not the default double-click action for external drives...\nUpdate: Looks like there are a couple of bugs that could be related:\n\n\n*\n\n*External FAT32 Hard Drive takes excessive time to open in Nautilus\n\n*nautilus fails to open external hard drive before open folder\n\nA: I believe that this is because it is actually an external disk and that Ubuntu is not mounting it automatically.

The second telling it to open. \nIf you would like it to duplicate the behaver of the usb drive, someone else will have to tell you how to set this up or I may find out how to do it and get back to you.\n\nA: I have read that for some types of devices (External Hard-Drives for example) the action of Double clicking on the access in the Desktop it is, for the first time to Mount it.

However, since using it, I've come across two issues:\n\n\n*\n*when I edit the .html and .php files, sometimes the file extension will change to .html~ and .php~, becoming invisible to the browser.  The only solution is to switch to Windows, right click and rename the file extension.\n\n*In Ubuntu Firefox, when I click on my prpject's Submit button for in a practice form, a dialog box pops up asking what Firefox should do with the .php file, rather than simply displaying it in the browser.  When I do this in Windows Chrome & Firefox, it goes right to the response page.\n\nI'm not sure if this behavior is limited to gPHPEdit/Kompozer, but I've never noticed this happening in Dreamweaver.  Any solutions?\nEDIT 1 The behavior in Point 1 occurs both when Dreamweaver is open in Windows accessing the same files and when it is not.  I changed the extension filename of welcome.php, added a comment in gPHPEdit, and the file changed to welcome.php~ upon saving.\nEDIT 2 Using Geany in place of Kompozer/gPHPEdit has solved this problem. Point 2 behavior is resolved after closing then restarting Firefox.  \n\nA: For Point 1 - your editor is making a backup files. Backup file are normally pre-seeded with a ~ symbol. Like for example using gedit, kate or bluefish. They make a ~ file AND additionally add the dot sign in the front to make it invisible so it does not bother the programmer as a backup file. You can remove this behaviour form any editor in the preference/configuration/settings options where it mentions the way to SAVE/LOAD files. normally it will say something about \"Make a backup with the ~ prefix\"\nFor Point 2 - You can NOT open a php file using firefox because a PHP file is first processed by a server, normally a server that has apache+php services. Firefox first sends the info that it wants to see the php file, the php service processes the php information and then it sends it to apache which sends it to you and it firefox renders the page for you.\nDoes not matter if you are in windows/mac/linux in all cases the PC where you want to see (Or correctly PROCESS the php file) should have the services needed for it AND the php file in a directory read by the html service.\nIn the case on Ubuntu, you will need for example the apache + php services installed AND the php in the directory that http://localhost points to so it KNOWS it is serving the php file as a web service. That way apache and php take care to correctly process the php file and send it to the browser so it can render it.\nVerify in your case that you have php/apache in the place where you are running the browser AND verify that the php file is in the web directory (normally in /var/www or /home/USER/www)\nStart the browser with http://localhost and browse THROUGH there to the php file.\nEDIT: Just read your edit. Make sure that the virtual Ubuntu has an IP that when you type it in the host it goes to the Virtual ubuntu. that way you have a Virtual PC where you can make the web and the host who is the client. For example:\nHOST - 192.168.0.1\nVIRTUAL - 192.168.0.10\nWebSite: http://192.168.0.10\n\nA: You should not use multiple questions in a single post.\nPoint 2 is related to mime/type caching, you probably tried to access localhost PHP files before installing PHP. Clearing the browser cache is usually sufficient.\n", "Q: How to activate WebGL in Chromium Beta? Does anyone succeeded in activating WebGL in Chromium Beta in Ubuntu 10.04?

How do I count the clicks of the mouse buttons since the start of Ubuntu?\nI would like to do mouse button clicks stats so I need it.\nThanks\n\nA: xinput can do what you need, Lukasz. You can have an one-liner (well, not exactly an one-liner, but you'll press ENTER only once :-D) for that, but first you must do some work. I swear it's pretty easy, I'll just explain most of the things here for the sake of clarity.\nOpen a Terminal, and type:\nxinput list\n\nYou'll get a nice list of pointers, keyboard buttons, etc., like this excerpt from mine:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ USB+PS/2 Optical Mouse                    id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ PS/2 Mouse                                id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint                  id=14   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nMy USB mouse is right at the second line, and you see that its ID is 10. Locate your mouse in the list and note its ID, you'll need it for the main command for what you want.\nIf you want to check if you got the right ID, run xinput test <id>. If you move the mouse, click buttons, etc., you should see lots of info lines going up on your Terminal. It's listing everything you do with your mouse. If nothing happens, try another id from your pointers list that makes sense to you, you probably chose the wrong one at first (this really shouldn't be that hard).\nWhen you finally found the correct id, run this command:\nxinput test <id>|sed -une '/release/ {      x\n     /^$/ s/^.*$/1/\n     G\n     h\n     s/^/      /\n     s/^ *\\(......\\)\\n/\\1  /p\n     x\n     s/\\n.*$//\n     /^9*$/ s/^/0/\n     s/.9*$/x&/\n     h\n     s/^.*x//\n     y/0123456789/1234567890/\n     x\n     s/x.*$//\n     G\n     s/\\n//\n     h\n}'\n\nCopy the above as it is and paste it. Before you hit ENTER, replace <id> with that id you found. When you run it, you let it there while you proceed with using the system. Anytime you want to check how many clicks were registered, you just take a look at the terminal.\nSome important comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unfortunately, I'm not so good at\nconsole, shell, commands, etc. I'm\npretty sure someone can improve this\nor provide a better solution. There's\nan inconvenience with my solution:\nyou don't really have results at real\ntime. For some reason, there seems to\nbe buffering, and you have to\ngenerate more mouse events to read\nthe older ones. So if you do a click\nand it's not shown, move your mouse a\nbit and soon the last click will\nshow. Sorry about this, but I've\ntried some things, but don't know how\nto solve that yet. Hope it's not that\nbad for you.\n\n*As you see, any\nclick is being counted. In case you\nwant to count the clicks for only one\nof the buttons, replace 'release' for\n'release 1', 'release 2', 'release\n3', well, you got the idea. If you\nwant to count them all, but with\nseparate stats, run the command (with\nthe proper button indication) in a\nseparate terminal.\n\n\nThe approach I've used: xinput list <id> does the dirty job, showing everything that happens with the mouse. Then I redirect this output to sed, which will parse only lines with 'release' events. I guess it's okay to consider that a 'release' event ends the 'click process' (button down and then up). The sed script not only shows the lines with 'release', but also numbers them. This script was directly copied from info sed (section 4.7), and surely could be improved.\n\nA: You can use evtest provided by the linux-input project.\nBut you must be sure to have CONFIG_INPUT_EVBUG=y in the kernel (probably the default if you install the debug version) and set the debug level to 8\necho 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk\n\nAt this point, from the console, you will see several messages, that you can parse.\nevbug.c: Event. Dev: gpio-keys/input0, Type: 0, Code: 0, Value: 0\nevbug.c: Event. Dev: gpio-keys/input0, Type: 1, Code: 103, Value: 1\n\nYou can then install the bitbake and evtest packages\nsudo apt-get install bitbake evtest\n\nThen you can use evtest against your device, you will need some tests to find out the right event you need and you can count the occurrence of that event. \nevtest /dev/input/eventXX\n\nOtherwise, if you want to count just the click since you logged in GDM/XDM, you can develop or ask someone to do it, an application using GTK, or Qt or wxWidgets, Enlightenment, or whatever you like, to monitor mouse events and start this application as soon as the desktopm comes up.\n\nA: Though not totally what you want, WhatPulse is something nice to keep track of various titbits like that + an online ranking with teams, countries, ...\n", "Q: How to block internet access for wine applications?

Consider using Deja-Dup to back up your /home folder)\n\n*Make a Swap Partition that is twice the size of your RAM, which should be 1GB as you said\nNOTE:\nYou will not have trouble accessing your NTFS Windows Partitions from Ubuntu it is actually the other way around. Windows will not recognize the EXT4 Ubuntu Partition\nSOLUTION:\nKeep most of your personal files on your Windows Partitions like movies or documents. This way both Ubuntu and Windows can access your personal files.\n\nA: you should keep the ubuntu's home and root together and then create another ntfs partition where you would share folders between ubuntu and windows. ubuntu crashes ntfs partitions over time, this would avoid affecting core windows files. besides that you are okay since ubuntu itself doesn't need more than 3GiB for installation.\n\nA: Safety first:\nI would first make a full backup of any data you might have on your computer. The resizing of any partition always involves somewhat dangerous operations where one's data can be corrupted or lost. Also, make sure you have the Windows recovery CD/DVD available, should anything bad happen. \nIf your computer can boot from USB, I would recommend first setting up a full Ubuntu on USB disk and boot your computer over USB, so you can test whether you can solve hardware issues, should you have any. I had some issue on my HP Mini, which I found first, and then solved before installing it. \nOnce you can confirm that indeed all major hardware components work with Ubuntu, either through more hardware drivers (open-source or closed), and that you have no major issue, except speed of the USB disk, I would be ready to actually install UBUNTU, from either a bootable CDROM or a bootable USB disk. I also think that a shared NTFS partition would be wise, so that if Ubuntu causes problems, those wil be on this shared NTFS partition, not your Windows one. \nAs for a third OS, I would suggest something like Fedora or Mandriva, s those are very well-known ones, but are using different system for package management and runlevels. You could also install Kubuntu, if you want to play with KDE instead of Gnome for the graphical user interface. \n\nA: i have Laptop OEM 2 and here is what i do \ni install windows normally and i pop in my Ubuntu 10.10 CD while i`m inside windows and i install it on the second portion \"D\" \nthat way i get -dual boot -the ability to uninstall Ubuntu easily from the control panel as a program - and it only makes a new folder in the portion i chose and names it \"Ubuntu\"\n", "Q: Mouse running amok While using my mouse, it will all of a sudden take off and might run to calendar or/and trash.

As Stefano said, unplug your network cable and see it it happens again. You can also unplug the mouse and see if it happens. If it happens with the mouse out and the network cable in, then you might have an intruder, and you would need to check and see where your system is open to attack (for that, would be best to open a new question). If it happens with both mouse and network cable out - ghosts? O.o...\n\nA: I use wireless mice and most of my mouse problems are fixed by two things:\n1) Replace the batteries (when there are some).  Sometimes mice stop working on low power, sometime they act very strange, similar to what you describe.\n2) Remove and re-insert the USB dongle.  I was skeptical when I first read this, so was pleasantly surprised when I find it is a frequent fix to problems (especially super-fast scrolling up/down issues).\nThese are specific to wirless mouse but as they are extremely common these days I post this to help others who experience these problems and have wireless mice.\n", "Q: How to diagnose usb issue So my kern.log and syslog files filled up with tons of the below messages:\n[514971.000109] phy0 -> rt2x00usb_vendor_request: Error - Vendor Request 0x07 failed for offset 0x30c4 with error -108\n\nI was curious as to the steps to take, commands to run, places to look to help diagnose this issue (and curious as to what caused it)?\nI'm guessing it's something USB elated. I had some issues with my printer earlier today so this might be related.\n\nA: Your problem is caused by a Realtek Wireless adapter that isn't very well supported.\nUnfortunately, the only solution I could find is to get rid of it. If your wireless network is working properly, you can safely ignore the errors. If it's not, you should Ask a question about it, or see if it has already been asked.\nYour wireless adapter identifies itself as rt2x00usb, and it's probably using the rt73usb kernel module. You can check what kernel modules are loaded by doing\nmodprobe -l | grep rtl.*usb\n\nor \nmodprobe -l | grep rtl\n\nIf you don't use the card at all, you can add the kernel module to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (open the file by pressing Alt+F2 and typing sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf), this will prevent it from being loaded.\nHave a look around this site if you do have wireless problems, there are quite a few question about Realtek adapters.  \n", "Q: Cannot enable Firefox \"submit crash report\" option Inside Firefox, I try to check the box in Edit->Preferences->Advanced->General which says Submit crash report, but each time I close the browser and open it again it remains unchecked. What could be wrong?\n\nA: It seems that I have discovered the answer. When I asked Firefox to Never remember history, the Submit crash report option will always become unchecked after closing and reopening. However when I changed it to Remember history, the Submit crash report option can finally remain checked.\nThis is possibly due to the fact that no crash report can be submitted if no history is stored according to the current way the browser is set. In fact, the same thing happens using Firefox in Windows.\n\nA: *\n\n*It is because Firefox in Ubuntu repositories is configured to use Ubuntu's crash reporting tools instead of the one built in by Mozilla.\n\n*Same as with updating Firefox, it's handled through same package management as every other application on your system instead of using Firefox own update tool.\n\n\nA: I was having a bit of difficulty working out where firefox stored this setting on ubuntu, because I was limiting my search to the ~/.mozilla/firefox/[profile]/ dir -\nFor reference sake if anyone else is searching for it and came across this thread like I did, the setting is in:\n~/.mozilla/firefox/Crash\\ Reports/crashreporter.ini\n[Crash Reporter]\nSubmitReport=0\n\nor SubmitReport=1 to enable.\n", "Q: Lost /boot partition Recently I installed Windows XP on my machine where I had only Ubuntu.

Share the folder but do not give guest access. Close nautilus. \nGo to your Windows box and access the share and provide the Ubuntu username and password.\nEnsure your Ubuntu firewall allows incoming access to Samba ports. Ensure Windows firewall allows outgoing access for the same ports.\n\nA: I have a ubuntu server with a number of computers and laptops running Windows 7 and found that one laptop would not allow access to files in folders stating \"You may not have permission etc\". Scoured the internet for 3 days - no luck. Finally decided to ask my son who installed the server and he said that Windows 7 can store passwords to the server and sometimes these become corrupt. The simple answer was as follows :-\nIf you saved a password for a network drive in windows and want to remove it, press the keys [Windows] + [R] to open the windows command line. Then enter\ncontrol keymgr.dll\nand click on “OK” to open the windows credential manager which allows you to manage and delete passwords saved in Windows.\nHighlight server and click REMOVE FROM VAULT\nReboot computer.\nThis procedure works for Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7.\n\nA: Have you installed Samba? sudo apt-get install samba\nIf so, then you need to set a Samba password: sudo smbpasswd -a USERNAME. This command will generate a prompt for a password (substitute USERNAME with your username).\nSet a folder to share mkdir /home/USERNAME/sharedfolder\nMake a backup copy of your smb.conf file: sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf ~\nOpen your smb.conf file: gksu gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf\nAdd this to the very end of the file:\n[sharedfolder]\npath = /home/USERNAME/sharedfolder\navailable = yes\nvalid users = USERNAME\nread only = no\nbrowsable = yes\npublic = yes\nwritable = yes\n\nThere should be NO spaces between the lines, and there should be a single space both before and after each of the equal signs.

No matter what I enter, it won't let me in. How do I configure this to share normally?\n\nTo do so you must set up a Samba user/password on your Linux machine as I described above. I could recommend a GUI program for Ubuntu to do this, but frankly it's much more complicated and confusing to do it that way. The program is gadmin-samba and it's in the Ubuntu repository. Caution! you can totally bork your config if you misuse this program.\nPlease let us know what steps you've now taken, and which errors you have encountered. Thanks!\n\nA: I completely uninstalled and purged samba and samba-common, then reinstalled them and all the packages that depended on them.  Now the GUI sharing and computer's hostname works again, though it only works in Guest mode.\nI haven't figured out what credentials to use otherwise.  WINDOWSMACHINE/winusername UBUNTUMACHINE/ubuntuusername or just plain username.  Nothing works.  But Guest mode works.\nThe folders I'm sharing contain other folders.  Sometimes these are inaccessible to the Windows machine and sometimes they're accessible.  Apparently when it says \"let me configure permissions for you\", it only does i for the folder you're sharing, not the subfolders.  If the folder permissions for \"Group\" and \"Others\" aren't set to \"Create and delete files\", then you can't access it in guest mode.  \n\nA: I had the same problem. \n\"You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions\".\n All was working fine with samba until doing a fresh install of 11.10 (the upgrade install did not break samba shares).\nI installed \"Samba Server Configuration Tool 1.2.63\" and it showed that the default user was nobody.  Changed that to coincide with my password and all worked fine after that.  I had compared my samba config files and nothing was different.  The tool mentioned fixed it.\n\nA: I had heaps of problems with this and just got it right so I thought I would just document it.\nI think the final thing that set me right was opening the smb.conf file (/var/etc/samba/)\nand at the end of the file the folders that I thought were shared had a colon; before the   browseable = yes which I removed. I think that was the final step.\nI also previously changed the regedit on windows with a Win7_Samba3DomainMember.reg file (although I think I'm using Samba(1) --- alot of guess work going on here :> I found the gadmin-samba NOT useful, it made things worse, but I recon thats due to my limtied knowledge, but the other Samba Utility was vey helpful (system-config-samba).\nBesides all the usual folder permissions the \"personal file sharing\" (accessed through the Dash) also had some simple configuration which I assumed would have not needed to be done.\n\nA: for me it worked by simply commenting the line that says security = share and uncommenting the line that says security = user in smb.conf\n\nA: *\n\n*If using Windows 7, you may need to change your registry settings:\nExecute the file Win7_SambaDomainMember.reg, which will insert the following registry settings (See the Samba wiki for details)\nHKLM\\System\\CCS\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\\Parameters\n     DWORD  DomainCompatibilityMode = 1\n     DWORD  DNSNameResolutionRequired = 0\n\nthen reboot (I am not aware of any side-effects other than allowing access to Samba)\n\n*If using Ubuntu 11.10, make sure that you have python-glade2 installed\nsudo apt-get install python-glade2\n\n\nA: I had the same problem when I wanted to share a drive.  I had to edit my fstab to auto-mount the drive to my specified mount point.  I then tried to configure the smb.conf file to share the drive.  The drive did show in windows but I couldn't navigate it so I tried what you did but when I tried to do this under the share tab in the properties dialog box a message came up to insert this option in the global part of the smb.conffile:\nusershare owner only = false\n\nI then commented out my config to share that mount point in the smb.conf file.\nThis worked for me...\n\nA: Try this from the Win7 box:\nControl Panel > Administrative Tools\n\nLocal Security Policy > Local Policies > Security Options\n\nModify these entries:\nNetwork security: LAN Manager authentication level\nSend LM & NTLM responses\nMinimum session security for NTLM SSP\nDisable Require 128-bit encryption\n", "Q: GNOME alternatives / equivalent for Klipper?

I know about unity but heard some bad stuff about it, so I wonder if I might be better sticking to the desktop edition. What do you think? any recommendations?\nAlso, should I use the 32 bit or 64 bit version?\n\nA: You should install the 32 bit* version of the Ubuntu 10.10 netbook edition.

So long as you are not doing anything intensive, your system will mostly avoid using swap so long as there is sufficient RAM. Maybe a good consideration would be to add more RAM if possible - give it about 4GB. If you don't allocate swap space, there is another option (not recommended) - hibernating to a file (I will add the links to my answer later).\nBest wishes! I will update my answer with relevant links, as well as possibly resources for learning Ubuntu/Linux :).\n\nA: I'll start by saying that the answer you linked already summarizes all the optimizations you may need.\nNext, to answer your questions:\n1. Which file system (ext2/3/4 or something else)? (consider SSD life)\next4 is a good filesystem even for SSD, so that would be my suggestion.\n(If you want performance so bad you should try XFS )\n2. Can it be changed after installation?\nYes, but it is not trivial, so choose well from the start :)\n3. Should I partition the disk? (as we do in traditional HDD) for now, no plan of dual booting. Only Ubuntu will live on scarce space of 80GB SSD.\nThis is really not a matter of SSD, but your personal choice. If you were to ask me I'll say no; don't partition the disk you will end in loosing useful space.\n(If you end with a partition with 2GB free and another with 1GB free, you theoretically have 3Gb free but cannot copy a 3GB file... that space is wasted )\n4. I have 2 GB RAM, should I still allocate swap space (if I dont allocate swap space, can i still hibernate the machine)? will swap space impact SSD life?\nI wouldn't worry so much about the SSD life ( modern one can run for decades ), however 2GB of RAM are enough not to need the swap partition. \nFinally the swap partition is needed in order to hibernation, so if you want to hibernate the machine then you need the swap partition.\n5. Should I consider putting additional 1GB RAM to avoid swap space?\n1GB more or ram is always useful :) do it if you can.\n6. What is partition aligning? is it needed to be done before installing the Ubuntu OS or can be done later?\nThat is the procedure where you align clusters, blocks and chunks. IMHO it is only needed on servers with a lot of data throughput. A good tool to do partition alignment is GParted. Of course this should be done before installing Ubuntu.\nHope this helps :)\n\nA: Concerning Swap on SSDs:\nI wouldn't care too much about putting a swap-partition on a SSD. The swap is, like said before, only used if there's no RAM left. But then there are \"few\" sequential writes and \"many\" random reads. That's exactly a form of usage SSDs excel in. - The same principle is used by microsofts \"readyboost\" technologie, only with USB-Flashdrives.\n\nA: Not to throw a monkey wrench in, but checking what the manufacturer of the SSD says about the need for those techniques might pay off.  \nThe folks who made my SDD assert that I don't need to worry about TRIM and optimizations, etc. They claim their firmware makes all of that unnecessary, that the SSD should be used like any other drive.  I took them at their word and so far so good. \n\nA: I would recommend against having any swap space on your 80G SSD card. The swap space, as it names implies, is a location where the files are read/written all the time, when your computer is heavily loaded. The SSD-based disks should not be read/written all the time, as each \"cell\" or allocation unit is meant to be read/written so many times, after which they are no more reliable. You should invest in more RAM, even if it is overkill. Then, monitor your RAM usage over a heavily loaded session (lots of browser, videos, compiler, etc). For the file system, I would stick with what Ubuntu offers. You can: \n- manually partition your disk, allocating all the remaining space to one or more ext3 partition(s).That would be the recommended one, as you don't waste space. \n- go with the default partition setup, then delete the swap partition\n", "Q: Ubuntu (and any other linux os) not booting from cd or usb When i was using KDE on Ubuntu 10.10 kwin crashed then I shut down the system, next when I booted it up, the display came up completely garbled and went to safe graphics mode, it worked and I reinstalled the Nvidia drivers and then restarted .Then immediately, It said\nNo init found   \nBusybox XX.XX\n\nthen I thought I'll do a fresh install I inserted the Ubuntu CD provided to me by Canonical.

If I have understood your question right, that option will give you the install you want.\n(The use of LVM is to allow different \"partitions\" within one Encrypted block.)\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu 10.10 you are asked if you want to encrypt your file system by default.\n\nIMO it is sufficient to encrypt '/home' and '/swap' and leave '/' non-encrypted for better perfomance especially on a netbook CPU. However you need to take care not to deliberately store private data outside /home. See also Encrypted Home. \nIf you really need to encrypt your whole system with dual-boot to Truecrypt encrypted Windows you need to install Grub to your Linux partition and keep your Truecrypt boot-loader in the MBR.

Last time I installed Ubuntu there was a \"-pae\" at the end of the kernel version in the boot screen. Now that I've reinstalled Ubuntu from the same disk instead of \"-pae\" there is a \"-generic\" at the end of kernel version.\nWhat's the meaning of those terms? Why do they different between two installations?\n\nA: *\n\n*Thats PAE - Physical Address Extension is a technology which allows 32 bit operating systems to use up to 64 Gb of memory (RAM), something which is normally achieved by switching to a 64 bit system.\n\n*To know more details about PAE look at this link.\n\n*PAE kernels give you the feature of 64 bit systems (the ability to use >3.2gb of RAM)\n\n*Where the generic kernel with 32 bit cant.\n\n\nA: PAE stands for P-hysical A-ddress E-xtension to access 4 GiB RAM on 32-bit systems. This is not needed for a 64-bit Ubuntu.\nfor 11.10 and earlier\nFor 32-bit Ubuntu a PAE kernel is automatically downloaded and installed on a system with more than 3 GB of RAM. Otherwise, and if no network connection is available the generic kernel is used.\nfor 12.04 LTS\nNote that from Ubuntu and Kubuntu 12.04 LTS a PAE kernel only can be installed from the 32-bit installation CD. This may cause problems on old hardware when the CPU does not support PAE.Release Notes\nIn this rare cases we may have to install 32-bit Lubuntu or Xubuntu that still come with a non-PAE-kernel. We can install the Unity desktop later. Alternatively we may also install 32-bit 10.04 or 11.10 with the non-PAE kernel first. With an upgrade to 12.04 a non-PAE-kernel can also be upgraded to a non-PAE-kernel.\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS is the last release to support a non-PAE kernel.\n\nA: (PAE) stand for Physical Address Extension. It's a feature of x86 and x86-64 processors that allows more than 4 Gigabytes of physical memory to be used in 32-bit systems.\nWithout PAE kernel, you should see something as follows:\nfree -m\n\nSample output:\n\nTo enable PAE, open terminal and type the following command:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-server linux-image-server linux-server\n\nReboot your machine.\nNow check again :\nfree -m\n\nSample output:\n\n", "Q: Adding a dir to the PATH for my account everywhere I want to append the directory /home/bart/bin to my PATH. By my PATH, I mean that it should be available whenever I login, whether it be via the terminal, Gnome, KDE or SSH, but not for other users. What's the recommended way of doing this?\n\nA: Append your directory to PATH in /home/<user name>/.bashrc and source .bashrc from /home/<user name>/.profile using\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n. ~/.bashrc\nfi\n\nThis way your changes will be available to you only in both GNOME & KDE and also in bash.\nDo not edit /etc/profile as it will make the changes for all users.\n\nA: Adding the appropriate line in .bashrc in your home folder should be enough for terminal and ssh. However, i don't understand how your path will make a difference in Gnome(maybe it might in the run utility, but not sure about it).\nAdd the line PATH=/home/bart/bin:$PATH in your .bashrc.

The old MoBo (an AsRock P4VT8+) is not able to recognize the freaking burner when booting.\nSo I had to convert my IDE HD to USB HD and mount it on my laptop and install Ubuntu from there. The problem now is that I'm obviously getting kernel panic every now and then so I was wondering if it is possibile to rerun only the system and the hardware configuration.\nUPDATE: I'm getting kernel panics once I moved the IDE HD back.\n\nA: changing IDE / USB changes HDD name\nas IDE your HDD name is /dev/hdXY\nas USB is /dev/sdXY\nyou need to boot from a live CD and chroot to your disk, change sd with hd in /etc/fstab\nyou need to update grub configuration\nupdate-grub\n\n\nA: The system would have been setup with drivers etc specific to the laptop, and not that desktop, which is why it is likely to be having trouble. Redoing the configure steps as you suggested is no trivial matter - a world of much manual reading and web searching, as well as probably a chroot operation from a live CD, IF you can use the live CD on the target machine.\nIf the target machine refuses to recognize the burner, perhaps you could make a bootable USB stick from an Ubuntu LiveCD.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\nThis means you wouldn't need to depend on the burner and should be able to install on the target machine without moving the drive. \n", "Q: Is there a command to close a terminal window via commandline? Is there a command to close a terminal window via commandline?\n\nA: To close a terminal window you can use the exit command . Alternatively you can use the shortcut ctrl+shift+w to close a terminal tab and ctrl+shift+q to close the entire terminal including all tabs. \n\nA: I know this answer is a little bit late but, If you are using Ubuntu or another Linux distro, simply use Ctrl+D to close the entire terminal.\nI initially tried all the rest and they were just not working. For example I see people recommending exit but honestly, it just doesnt work.\nI hope someone agrees with me.\n\nA: You can use xdotool:\nxdotool getactivewindow windowkill\nNotice that this will kill all active windows!\nIf you want to kill only the current window use:\nxdotool key --clearmodifiers Ctrl+Shift+Q key --clearmodifiers KP_Enter\n\nA: You can use the ^D shortcut - that is, hitting Control and d. This works in many shells and shell-like environments. Technically speaking, this key combination emits the end-of-transmission character (ASCII code 04). In gnome-terminal, i.e. bash and other shells, this is interpreted as finishing the interactive session. You can also see this behavior in programs like cat which read from standard input (the keyboard). Try running it without arguments; you can terminate by entering ^D.\n\nA: exit\n\nis the command you want to use for that.\n\nA: There is an alternate way, which requires a bit more keystrokes, but is worth knowing.\nUsing exec command\n\n\n*\n\n*Syntax\n\n\nexec <command-name>\n\n\n*\n\n*This will first execute the <command-name> and then exit the shell.\n\n*For example, you could do:\nexec sleep 1\n            which would, effectively, close the window after 1 second.\n\nA: Yes there is.First type echo $$ in terminal to know it's process id. Then type kill -9 processid.\n\nA: To close the terminal whilst leaving all running processes to continue running, you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*pause the process using Ctrl +  Z , pull it into the background with bg and then disown it, eg:\n\n\nvlc\n^Z\n[1]+  Stopped   \nbg\n\n[1]+ vlc &\n    disown\nexit\n\nThis will leave the current running process running in the background and close the terminal(i find this to be very useful).\n\nA: Yes. The command is exit. Type exit into the terminal and press enter\n\nA: I'm using KDE here. I wrote a script and I execute it by right click > execute in console. After the executtion, the newly opened window of konsole, was left open and I had to manualy close it (by pressing X or Alt+F4, or typing exit).\nI combined two of your answers here (THANKS to the posters) and now the window closes automatically.\nSample:\n#!/bin/bash\n# \necho Hello & disown\nsleep 1\necho Closing in 3\nsleep 1\necho Closing in 2\nsleep 1\necho Closing in 1\nsleep 1\nxdotool getactivewindow windowkill\n\nWithout the & disown and xdotool getactivewindow windowkill, just by using \"exit\" at the end, nothing happened!\nThank you again!\n", "Q: My name no longer appears on gnome-panel I booted up my laptop this morning to find my name no longer appears beside the power off button in the top right hand corner of the top gnome panel:\n\nI tried deleting and re-adding the indicator applet session to the panel but it still doesn't display my name.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Install the indicator-me package.\n", "Q: U1 music shows unknown artist, how can I make it recognize m4a files?

I have an mp3 playlist in Rhythmbox. When I drag and drop it in a Brasero data project the order of songs is lost. In fact their sorted in alhpabetical order. As you can imagine this is awful for a list of songs you want to listen to a particular order. This does not happen when I burn a list as audio and not data project.\n\nA: An audio CD consists of tracks. They are numbered and do not contain any Data about Artist etc.\nA data CD however contains just that: data. Your files can be ordered by the file browser that opens it. The playlist from Rhythmbox is not part of the mp3 files. You however try to export it as an m3u file. Most audio player software can read that format.\n\nA: Jdpipe over on ubuntuforums.org posted a great little python script to solve this issue.\nIt works by creating a sequence of symlinks from a playlist (m3u) and then feeding that to Brasero.\nWorked great for me!\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=7503949&postcount=7\nMake the python script executable and then run it from a terminal thus:\n./m3utocd.py 'PathTo/MyPlaylist.m3u' \n\n", "Q: PIN request at each login after update to Maverick I have a netbook with included 3G mobile broadband card (Huawei E620).

(RAR) I thought that all applications in Ubuntu repositories are free, but today I wanted to install rar package and its description says, that this is shareware and I could use it (without registration) only 40 days.\nAre there more packages like rar? How can I find the licence of programs in repositories?\n\nA: The rar package is from the multiverse repository, which contains:\n\nSoftware that is not free. (source)\n\nIf you wish to use only free software, only use the Main and Universe repositories. (And if you want 100% pure free, use a distribution from this list)\nThe licence of any installed package can be found at /usr/share/doc/#{package}/copyright, so /usr/share/doc/rar/copyright for rar. You can also find a copy of the copyright file by following the link at the right of the package page. Here is the direct link for the rar copyright file.\nThe 40 day thing doesn't mean that it will automatically uninstall but the licence says you need to buy a licence when you have used it for 40 days. I'd just ignore this.\nEven better than potentially doing something illegal - don'tmake rar archives. There really is no reason to. If you wan't a cross platform format supported almost everywhere out of the box, use zip.\n\nA: Most of Ubuntu is free software (meaning not just that you don't have to pay for it, but also that you can distribute it, study its source, and modify it).\nHowever Ubuntu also includes a small amount of non-free software, in separate components: restricted (non-free, supported) and multiverse (non-free, not supported). These are programs that may be distributed over the Internet at no charge, but have restrictions that make them non-free. A prime example is drivers for devices which do not have fully-featured free drivers.\nYou can tell a package is non-free because it's from the restricted or multiverse repository. In Synaptic, check the “Section” in the ”Common” tab of the package properties. Exactly what restrictions are on the package has to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Most can be used and redistributed by anyone, but modifications are not allowed and the source code may not be available. A few, such as rar, have restrictions even on use. Once the package is installed, you can always find its license in /usr/share/doc/$packagename/copyright. On packages.ubuntu.com, check the “Copyright File” link in the right-hand column.\n\nA: Hello josef,\nGenerally speaking you use the program unrar to extract RARS. A free version exists (unrar-free) but it has some limitations.\nNote that unrar is non-free because it contains proprietary code, not because you have to pay for it.\nI believe you're using the Ubuntu Software Center, you might find the unrar program by searching unarchiver. If you don't find anything, use the Synaptic Package Manager (System -> Administration).\nBut the quickest way to install it would be to open a terminal and type :\nsudo apt-get install unrar\n\n", "Q: Internet connection through Bluetooth PAN profile?

Maybe it's just as simple with 9.04.\n", "Q: What is the \"Waiting Channel\" of a process? In the GNOME System Monitor's Processes tab there is a \"Waiting Channel\" column. By far the most common values I see here is poll_schedule_timeout , but I also see other values: 0, do_exit, do_wait, futex_wait_queue_me, pipe_wait, __skb_recv_datagram and unix_stream_data_wait.\nSo what does this \"Waiting Channel\" column mean? And perhaps what do some of those values in it mean?\n\n\nA: The waiting channel is the place in the Kernel where the task\nis currently waiting. A task has to wait for a Resource, which\ncan be data or processing time. These two include network sockets, hardware, files, and so on; since most of them are just files, in Unix-like systems.\n\n\n*\n\n*0: The process isn't waiting\n\n*poll_schedule_timeout\npoll() is a system call1 used to handle I/O.\nIt's similar to select().2\nApplications that use non-blocking I/O use these calls to see if they\ncan read from or write to a file, withouth having to block it. They are\noften used for input/output streams, which may not be blocked (otherwise,\nperhaps your mouse would stop to move). \nThe waiting channel poll_schedule_timeout indicates that a task is\nwaiting for I/O, either hardware like keyboards and mice, sound devices\nor even network sockets. \n\n\n*\n\n*A function in the Kernel\n\n*They are defined in <linux/poll.h>. poll was an implementation first\nseen in System V, select is the BSD UNIX equivalent. \n\n\n\n*futex_wait_queue_me:\nTo explain this, we have to look at Locks. A lock is a saved state in the\nsystem that indicates that a task works with a resource. There can be, for\nexample, only one task that reads a file. This task would lock the file, any\nother task1 that tries to read the file would know it's locked, and wait for\nthe lock to go away, before it can access it. The same thing happens for\nprocessor time.\nModern version of Linux (on most architectures) use a Futex (fast userspace\nmutex) lock in the kernel. Mutex, mutual exclusion, refers to the idea that\na common resource can only be accessed by one task at any time. For this, flags\nin the system are set.\nIf a process is waiting for a locked resource, this is called Busy Waiting\nor \"Spinning\", refering to the fact that it tries to access it over and over,\nuntil it can. A task is said to be blocked when it spins.\n\nFutex locks can be thought of as a number in userspace, that can be incremented\nor decremented by a task (in cases where the resource can be accessed by\nmultiple tasks, this number can become greater than one). This is the number\nshown in the diagram4.\nThese tasks enqueue themselves in the wait queue, a simple queue of tasks that need to do some work,\nonce processing time is available, the tasks do their work and are removed\nfrom the queue.\nfutex_wait_queue_me enqueues a tasks. It then waits for a signal, a time\nout or a wakeup. Task that are in this waiting channel are waiting not\non the wait queue, they are waiting to be enqueued. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*A task can be either a Process3 or a Thread2\n\n*A Thread is a sub-section of a Process. Many threads can run parallel\n\n*A process is a full-blown program, it consists of one or more threads, though a program can consist of multiple processes as well.\n\n*Remember, this is still a very high level view of things, it's not considering the implementation details\n\n\n*__skb_recv_datagram\nWait for some data on a locked network socket.\n\n*sk_wait_data\nWait for some data on a network socket.\n\n*do_exit\nThis is the last part of quitting a process. do_exit() calls the schedule() next, to schedule another process. When do_exit() is called, the process is a ZOMBIE.\n\n*do_wait\nA process is added to the schedulers wait queue. \n\n*pipe_wait, unix_stream_data_wait\nA Process is waiting for data from a subprocess. This happens, for example, when you run this sort of code:\necho | sleep 10 && echo hallo              # pipe\n\nor\ncat < hello.c                              # unix data stream\n\n\n*hrtimer_nanosleep\nThe process is sleeping, using the hrtimer_nanosleep() method. This method can be used for a program to sleep for specific intervals of time, with nanosecond accuracy. \nThese aren't all, but I didn't observe any others. Post a comment if I've missed anything.\n\nA: The waiting channel value is the name of the kernel function in which the\nprocess is currently blocked.\nThe name is usually related to a system call, which will have a\nmanual page.  \n\n\n*\n\n*futex_wait_queue_me is related to futex.  It refers to a type of mutex lock (fast userspace mutual exclusion) that is used to schedule many processes work on one processor. The state indicates that your process is enqueued to receive the lock. 2 \n\n*do_wait is related to wait.   \n\n*etc.\n\n\nIf you really want more detailed information you could check the kernel source.\nIf you type cat /proc/some_pid/stack in a terminal you'll get some output like that one :\n[<c0227f4e>] poll_schedule_timeout+0x3e/0x60\n[<c022879f>] do_select+0x55f/0x670\n[<c0228f40>] core_sys_select+0x140/0x240\n[<c0229241>] sys_select+0x31/0xc0\n[<c05c9cc4>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb\n[<ffffffff>] 0xffffffff\n\nAnd on the first line you get what's displayed on the system monitor. As far as I know, poll_schedule_timeout indicates that your process is waiting for something.  \nIt deals with asynchronous I/O and polling.\nSource(s) : 1. process wait channel (WCHAN) and alarm? - 2.

Some Ubuntu-versions ago, there was a Popup that showed up while changing the brightness on my Asus V6V with FN+Key. It has been gone since (I guess) 9.04. When changing the Audio-Volume, I still have such a thing.\n\nHow can I get this back/working again?\n\nA: If the brightness controls still work, but the display is missing, then it's possible that the keys are going directly to your hardware (bios perhaps) and not being interpreted by xinput or any of the input subsystem.\nIn both 10.04 and 10.10 the system will show a notification if the brightness is changed via an input.\nIf you upgraded, it could be a problem with the notifications.\n", "Q: Set up multiple intranet sites My Ubuntu machine is on the network accessible at \\\\linux-server I have Apache2 installed and if I go to http://linux-server it takes me to /var/www as the root directory.\nIs it possible on the same machine to set it up so that http://jisaacks points to /var/www-jisaacks\n\nA: One method is to use the NameVirtualHost directive.\nThere is a howto here : http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/412.\n\nA: This article should help you.\n\nA: I think you're looking for Virtual host.

In addition to Ubuntu partition(s), I would like to have one separate partition for data (documents, music, etc.), so I could try other OSs in the future without losing the data.\nWhat partition scheme would you recommend? I usually like to let the installation do it by itself, but when I try to that I can only use the entire disk, so I don't get the desired data partition.\nI wish there was a way to see the recommended default partitioning scheme, then just tweak it a bit to fit your needs (instead of building one from scratch).\nSo, how would you recommend I partition my HD?

Windows can not currently read ext4 partitions that well. People are working on that. \nI have a second root partition set up as ort(other root). So when I upgrade I do a clean install. I don't want to get burned by having an unbootable system. So I can always boot back to the previous system. I can also copy my /etc/* config files that I am rather attached to into the new system or use them as a reference if I am setting up a new system. \nYou should also have swap partition about the same size as your ram up to a max of about 4 Gigs. It would also depend on how you use your system. Even on some of my smaller machines with 2Gigs I never really start using my swap partition so about 2Gigs would be a lot. \nLastly I make home the rest of the remaining disk space. If you have a boot disk you can always boot up into it and resize you partitions later. You can't change the order of the partitions with out deleting them. So if you just shrink your home partition and add extra partitions after that.

The system hangs during boot; the splash screen is frozen and it accepts neither Ctrl+Alt+F2 nor Ctrl+Alt+Del, only a hard reset. (I'm a linux noob.)\nWhen I edit the default Grub boot option to omit quiet splash, it gets to the point saying \n* setting sensors limit                                        [OK]\n_\n\nand there it stays. \nI can only get to the desktop using the Grub recovery boot option, of course with a lower resolution (800x600) but everything else seems to work fine.\nAs I said, this is a new install. The only thing I've done is to use the Update Manager to get everything up to date, and activate the newest Nvidia driver using the \"Hardware drivers\" window.\nI had a similar problem when I installed 9.04 a year ago, and at that time posted this question with an answer that worked - this doesn't work with 10.04. Running nvidia-xconfig to create a new xorg.conf didn't fix it either (while in Recovery boot).\nThe \"Hardware Drivers\" window just states NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version current) [Recommended]. I tried Jonathon's tip about uninstalling the driver and removing the conf file, to see if it can reboot in the normal mode but it just came back into recovery mode. /etc/X11/xorg.conf doesn't exist.\nUpdate:\nI don't know the exact version of the Nvidia driver. The \"Hardware Drivers\" window just states NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version current) [Recommended]. Also, There is no /etc/X11/xorg.conf, but there is a xorg.conf.failsafe which doesn't say much.\nThis question mentions nvidia-96. Would that be relevant in my case? \nUpdate 2:\nAs per Jorge's answer, I've now installed nvidia-glx-185 but afterward nvidia-xconfig doesn't exist (sudo: nvidia-xconfig: command not found). There is still no /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. However, I rebooted anyway and the normal mode (not failsafe) works! Now I got the desktop in 1024x768, which is a huge improvement already. I looked for the xorg.conf after reboot and it still doesn't exist.\nAdded: Would this be a useful driver? I tried downloading it but instead of a save-as dialog I got a looong page full of php or similar...\nUpdate 3:\nI tried Jorge's suggestion of nvidia-glx-185 but didn't manage to get it into 1280x1024. I then tried the version 260.19.29 linked above, but that quickly became very complicated and I ended up somehow breaking my installation (and my Windows boot as well, but I realize it's my own fault). I've now gone away from a Wubi installation and I'm writing this on a brand-new 10.10 installation on a real partition.\nSo, let's start over: Should I install the nvidia-glx-185 again, and then what?\n\nA: I spent some time googling this card and it appears that you need to be using the Nvidia 185 driver. Install it first\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-185\nand generate the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nThen reboot, that should at least get the card working. \nUpdate your question with what happens then we'll move on to setting the resolution.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you have a problem with setting your monitor to its native resolution.\nI have faced similar problems with my monitor.\nRefer to my answer, How to set the monitor to its native resolution which is not listed in the resolutions list?\nYou need to modify steps on monitor resolution you want, like step 1 - cvt 1280 1024\nBetter try it with some lower resolution first, try till step 6 if everything is ok go to step 6 else simply logout or reboot and your last resolution will be back.\n\nA: I have the same graphic card and I have installed both 10.04 and 10.10 on my system and after installing the latest nvidia driver provided by Ubuntu I have full 1280x1024 @75 on my HP 1702 monitor. I think that that problem is with the native settings of your Monitor i.e. Ubuntu is failing to recognize your monitor properly. You need to let ubuntu to detect your monitor so that it can set the monitor's native resolution properly.\n\nA: follow Jorge's steps, then try this as your xorg.conf\nSection \"Screen\"  \n    Identifier  \"Default Screen\"  \n    DefaultDepth    24  \nEndSection  \n\nSection \"Module\"  \n    Load    \"glx\"  \nEndSection  \n\nSection \"Device\"  \n    Identifier  \"Default Device\"  \n    Driver  \"nvidia\"  \n    Option  \"NoLogo\"    \"True\"  \nEndSection  \n\nIf this doesn't work try Load \"glx-185\" instead of Load \"glx\" - my card works with the nvidia latest, not sure if it's a different module name for the 185 driver or not. I would think not.\n\nA: BIOS actually has a lot to do with how your external card works with your motherboard. Installing from NVIDIA may be a pain, but this way you will make sure all configurations and all options are added properly to xorg and you will get that nice nvidia console as well.\n\nA: Simpler solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the recommended proprietary NVIDIA driver.\n\n*Click Monitors on the Preferences menu.\n\n*When the system recommends using the proprietor's setup, just say NO. Selecting the 1280x1024 resolution on the Ubuntu setup works. No 3D maybe, but who needs 3D?\n\n", "Q: Which Norton Commander style filemanager do you recommend? I'm searching for a good filemanager in style of the classic norton commander 2 panel design? Since i had my best experiences with Total Commander in Windows, which one would you recommend for use in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Mucommander\n\nAlso look at the following link,\n10 Total Commander Alternatives for Linux\n\nA: If you don't want to install other programs you can use two panels in nautilus by pressing F3 and using the list view.\n\nA: A piece of advice:\nYou might want to adjust your expectations. For the sake of your nerves. Total Commander has set the bar high. When such statement is being made people usually think of some power-user features most of TC users haven't seen but in fact this statement applies also to core usability features that are more commonly used. That said it's wise not to expect a replication of vast majority of core TC features in its Linux alternatives. An example: 2 years ago I installed Gnome Commander, Krusader and one other file manager on Linux. Neither of them provided means (e.g. custom column) to sort files by last access date.\nI'd also recommend refraining from recommending or even using applications that are no longer actively developed. It has nothing to do with them being buggy or insecure. It's just to make them go away faster and to avoid frustration in the future, when you get used to an application, then find a showstopper bug, just to learn that it will not be fixed ever. So please review the dates of the latest updates for respective applications and take them into consideration when choosing your future no. 1 app.\nIMHO, presuming you'd like to avoid installing KDE libraries for Krusader, the Gnome Commander and Double Commander are worth a chance the most.\nDouble Commander\nDouble Commander is not in 'production' version yet but it's actively developed and predicted by some to be the future best TC alternative for Linux. It's my file manager of choice now.\nSee: Double Commander website\n\nInstalling Double Commander:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:alexx2000/doublecmd\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install doublecmd-gtk\n\n\nA: SpaceFM\nsudo apt-get install spacefm\n\n\n\nA: Midnight Commander sounds like what you want:\nsudo apt-get install mc\n\n\n\nA: I used two pane managers on Windows. Was hard core fan of Dos Navigator, and relied on it (or it's forks) until I could resist GUI manager.  \nThere is NDN - Necromancer Dos Navigator which is DN fork and is available also for Linux, developed/tested (Linux version) on Ubuntu 8 or Ubuntu 6 IIRC:\n\nMany features included, far more than MC, only that it works best on TTY terminal and not windowed console (because of fonts and keyboard shortcuts)\nAs for GUI managers, I used Altap/Servant Salamander. Total Commander is also fine, but Altap was unique in many ways, lovely GUI to work in, easily extendible with scripting (JS, VBS, Python COM) accepts major Total Command plugins and performance just couldn't be better.\nThere is project hosted on Launchpad which offers file manager similar to Total Commander - Double Commander:\n\nwith usual features that user expects from two pane GUI manager (no thumbs view yet, thou)\nIt also has framework for acceptance of Total Commander plugins (users need to compile TC plugins by themselves)\n\nA: I had the same question some time ago. And I tried all of the mentioned commanders. Krusader is by far the best one but I didn't want to have whole bunch of KDE libraries installed. Gnome-Commander cripples system theme in order to get some more speed (I guess) but it doesn't support tabs. Mucommander is Java based and lacks integration with system (and it's Java based, did I mention that already). There's also TuxCommander which (at the moment) is not listed but that thing was made using Borland Kylix (now dead project) so its development is stopped or at least doomed. Midnight Commander is really really good, but am not that much of a terminal fan.\nSo, I did the only thing I could do... started making my own. Now I know how this sounds and am not going to praise it. It is still faaar from finished but I got some basics done. Also I try to add interesting and useful things to it. For example you can create terminal tab from the current tabs location. There's an option for create file as well as create directory. Oh, and command line history is loaded from .bash_history (one of these days am going to make 2 way sync with that file).\nCheck it out...\nIt sill needs a lot of work, and it's far from finished but if you don't mind trying out new things feel free to try it out. Also, any feedback is more than welcome.\n\n\nA: GNOME Commander  would be the most obvious choice. I don't use a specifically dual paned file manager so I couldn't really say which was best.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-commander\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that you can get a dual pane mode with Nautilus by pressing F3.\n\nA: Krusader\n\n", "Q: Why is my wi-fi still not working? i have 10.10, and have gotten ndiswrapper and the proper driver, it installed properly, but still my wi-fi isn't working.

As you can read in the above link to the PPA, you might need to add acpi_backlight=vendor to the linux-line of the grub entry for the new kernel (see the comments in this answer about how to add parameters to the kernel during boot).\n\nThe whole process is already detailed at the bottom of the page you linked.\n\nA: The num_private and num_private_args fields are only defined when  CONFIG_WEXT_PRIV is defined during kernel compilation hence you need to add the #ifdef/#endif lines here to iw_ndis.c:\nconst struct iw_handler_def ndis_handler_def = {\n    .num_standard   = sizeof(ndis_handler) / sizeof(ndis_handler[0]),\n#ifdef CONFIG_WEXT_PRIV \n    .num_private    = sizeof(priv_handler) / sizeof(priv_handler[0]),\n    .num_private_args = sizeof(priv_args) / sizeof(priv_args[0]),\n#endif\n    .standard   = (iw_handler *)ndis_handler,\n#ifdef CONFIG_WEXT_PRIV \n    .private    = (iw_handler *)priv_handler,\n    .private_args   = (struct iw_priv_args *)priv_args,\n#endif  \n    .get_wireless_stats = get_iw_stats,\n};\n\nHowever, that's not all. You'll also then get an error compiling wrapndis.c so you need to find the lines with the following if statement (at approx line 1820) and wrap that up in an #ifdef/#endif.\n#ifdef CONFIG_WEXT_PRIV\nif (wnd->physical_medium == NdisPhysicalMediumWirelessLan) {\nnet_dev->wireless_handlers = &ndis_handler_def;\n}#endif\nShould add that I am trying to compile this myself and have not tested ndiswrapper having done this so YMMV.\nThe above for wrapndis is wrong, it seems that CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXT is not set in (my) kernel configuration. If it was then I shouldn't get this error.\n", "Q: What are some good GUI binary viewers/editors?

I need to add the boot parameter foo=bar to my kernel. How can I do this once for testing, and permanently if testing was a success?\n\nA: To temporarily add a boot parameter to a kernel\n\n*\n\n*Start your system and wait for the GRUB menu to show (if you don't see a GRUB menu, press and hold the left Shift key right after starting the system).\n\n*Now highlight the kernel you want to use, and press the e key.

I'm using Ubuntu on a new Compaq Presario CQ56. The webcam was working fine for the first two days, in both Skype and Cheese, but simply turned black with thin vertical lines in the middle of a Skype call and now refuses to work in any program, including gstreamer-properties, Cheese, and VLC. It gives a black screen when rebooted into a live CD and tested. When tested, it either shows a plain black screen or black with thin vertical lines. Attached is an image of the video shown (it is static, there is no noise or static, and no response to variance in light).\nAlso, when I play music or sounds, it makes a garbled noise related to the sound being played, which may or may not be connected to the webcam issue.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas on what caused this, or whether it's a hardware or software issue, or how to fix it, I would appreciate them very much,\nThanks\n\nA: It looks and sounds like your webcam has had a hardware failure, the type of image your getting suggests the webcam is covered by something, but it may also be that the webcam is defective now and is giving off noise instead of data.\n", "Q: Text editor with coloring to highlight \"non-parameters\" in conf files? Some .conf files have a lot of comments and parameters in them like so,\n# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client\n# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both\n; wins server = w.x.y.z\n\n# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.\ndns proxy = no\n.....\n\nIt gets difficult to look for only the parameters among the plethora of comments, so is there some text editor that can highlight the comments in dark grey so that the real parameters stand out?\n\nA: Emacs does automatic syntax highlighting for .conf files. It's possible you won't like (I don't!) its colors for .conf files, so check https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1076503/change-emacs-syntax-highlighting-colors and you'll be able to change it to your tastes. And it can do it the same way with a GUI or in console mode.\nGEdit also does it, but not automatically. Manually set the highlighter (click on \"Plain Text\" on the status bar, or through View > Highlighter) to awk or sh, and you'll have a similar effect.\nI'm just suggesting these two. There are many other editors that will do what you want.\n", "Q: Reasonable size for \"filesystem reserved blocks\" for non-OS disks? When creating a file system ( mkfs ...) the file system reserves 5% of the space for its own use because, according to man tune2fs:\n\nReserving some number of filesystem\n  blocks for use by privileged processes\n  is done to avoid  filesystem \n  fragmentation,  and  to allow  system \n  daemons,  such  as syslogd(8), to\n  continue to function correctly after\n  non-privileged processes are prevented\n  from  writing  to  the filesystem.\n\nBut with large drives 5% is quite a lot of space. \nI have 4x1.5 TB drives for data storage (the OS runs on a separate disk), so the default setting would reserve 300 GB, which is an order of magnitude more than the the entire OS drive.\nThe reserved space can be tweaked, but what is a reasonable size for a data disk? Can I set it to zero, or could that lead to issues with fragmentation?\n\nA: I have found the following the answer https://www.redhat.com/archives/ext3-users/2009-January/msg00026.html, from Theodore Tso, an ext4 developer.\n\nIf you set the reserved block count to\n  zero, it won't affect performance much\n  except if you run for long periods of\n  time (with lots of file creates and\n  deletes) while the filesystem is\n  almost full (i.e., say above 95%), at\n  which point you'll be subject to\n  fragmentation problems. Ext4's\n  multi-block allocator is much more\n  fragmentation resistant, because it\n  tries much harder to find contiguous\n  blocks, so even if you don't enable\n  the other ext4 features, you'll see\n  better results simply mounting an ext3\n  filesystem using ext4 before the\n  filesystem gets completely full.\nIf you are just using the filesystem\n  for long-term archive, where files\n  aren't changing very often (i.e., a\n  huge mp3 or video store), it obviously\n  won't matter.\n\n", "Q: Error while loading mongodb when I put mongo command on terminal it gives me error like \nmongo: error while loading shared libraries: libmozjs.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nA: This sounds like you simply downloaded mongodb tarball and installed it without all of the dependencies.\nYou should either download the deb file or setup apt to get the deb from the 10gen repos.

I could not really understand why the default location for the MediaWiki files is /var/lib/mediawiki.

Instead >they should use the /usr/share/doc/package directory for documents and register the Web >Application via the doc-base package. If access to the web document root is unavoidable >then use\n/var/www\n\n\nWhy is this?\n\nA: It appears that we inherit this policy from Debian. The closest discussion I can seem to find on this policy is from this discussion in 2003.\nHowever I did find a new draft policy (Check out section 3.1) that appears to have more detail which might help solve your question. It specifically mentions the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. According to that /usr/share/doc includes \"Architecture-independent (shared) data.\", which includes web pages that user's can't modify.\nSince Mediawiki is user editable /var/lib/mediawiki would be the place for it to go since the FHS says that /var/lib is the place for \"State information. Persistent data modified by programs as they run, e.g., databases, packaging system metadata, etc.\n\" and the manual says:\n\nUser uploaded content\nA unique subdirectory of /var/lib/PACKAGE\n\nThe rest of the section in the manual explains architecture dependent things (like PHP and Perl).\nThis information is marked Draft however so I am not sure if it's enforced or pending in Debian. I would expect that if this were the final policy that we would likely inherit it from Debian.\nSo I guess the partial answer is \"The FHS says so and Debian follows it so we do.\" I (unfortunately) cannot find any information on the justification/reasons why the FHS is the way it is in this regard, maybe someone else will have better luck finding this information and adding an answer.\n\nA: Your custom content indeed goes to /var/www - where you can edit files, move them around, etc.\nHowever, PHP (and other) applications from the package repositories may install their internal libraries to /usr/share/packagename and /var/lib/packagename to better fit in with other (non-web) applications. See this list of MediaWiki package contents.\nAlso, packages may publish their HTML (and other) documentation on your local webserver if you are running one.

The help button in this dialog doesn't give any specifics about them.\nI've  experimented a little and found that meta seems to have some use, like Super+M = Me menu, or Super+S is the shutdown menu, but for some keys (B, I) it's more like Ctrl (bold, italic). Haven't found any further.\nWhat would a useful setting be for a Linux newbie? \n\nA: If you want to use it like in windows, to trigger the menu, go to System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts. Scroll down to and click on 'Show the panel's main menu'. Click on the right hand cell, which should change to 'New shortcut...' and press the Windows key.\nEDIT: turns out this doesn't work but you can make it work by pressing Alt+F2 then entering\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/panel_main_menu --type string \"Super_L\"\n\nYou can bind it to other things as well. You can use it as part of a key combination in for another shortcut or for an action in compiz. For example, I have my Windows key bound to the Initiate Window Resize action (because this is easier than trying to grab the sides of the window) which can be found in Compiz Config Settings Manager under Window Management -> Resize Window.\n\n\nA: Windows key tab is useful for compiz fusion toggling of windows.  It's also a great key to assign to your own custom shortcuts due to it's general lack of use in the linux world.\n\nA: I found a very simple way to add some useful key combinations in this question:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts.\n\n\n*Scroll through the list to find any action you want to assign to a keyboard shortcut.\nExample: Home Folder\n\n\n*Click in the right-hand column and then enter your desired key combo.\nExample: Super + E\n\n\n*Test your new combo.\n\n\n*Done!\nNote: I've realized after writing this answer that dv3500ea wrote a similar answer which he claims doesn't work and added a part about compiz that I don't quite \"get\". But the simple approach works for me. I've upvoted his answer.\n\nA: I am using it as a keyboard layout switcher (to type in different language)\n\nA: Not sure if this applies to people other than kubuntu, but I was having a hard time assigning just the press of the windows key.\nTurned out that ctrl+f1 was mapped to the windows key, so having my activity panel ( i wanted the full screen launcher, not the regular launcher ) mapped to ctrl+f1 made the solo press of the windows key work.\n", "Q: What are the Meta, Super, and Hyper keys? In System → Preferences → Keyboard → Layout → Options → Alt/Win key behavior in older Ubuntu versions or in GNOME Tweaks → Keyboard & Mouse → Additional Layout Options → Alt and Win behavior for Ubuntu 17.10 and later, there is a menu similar to the one in the following screenshot:\n\nWhat do Meta, Super, Hyper mean?\n\nA: Meta, Super and Hyper are modifier keys that modify the key's function. They are specific to the Symbolics Space Cadet Keyboard used on Lisp machines back in the day. Their function is sometimes emulated using other keys.\n\n\n*\n\n*Meta\nThe Meta key is not found on modern keyboards. Its use is sometimes emulated with AltGr (on some international layouts) or the right Alt key on the others. In addition:\n\n*\n\n*Sun keyboards have a meta key (◆) as well\n\n*Emacs calls Esc the Meta key\n\n\n\n*Super\nThe Super key is equivalent to  or the ⌘ (command) key. In Ubuntu, it's just another name for .\n\n\n*Hyper\nHyper is the fourth (counting Ctrl) and last modifier on the Space cadet keyboard. In Ubuntu, its function is undefined (I think), but it can be mapped, as in the screen shot above, to , should it be needed.\nSun's keyboard had different modifiers.\nNote that GNOME and X.org implement many modifiers. Meta, Super and Hyper are not Linux's way of dealing with any modifier keys, but merely three of them specific to the Space Cadet keyboard. There is also Menu, Compose, AltGr, Greek, Front, X and others.\nHowever, by convention the Windows logo key is called Super, and it is not implemented as yet another modifier by X.org.\nFurthermore, the definition of modifier keys depends on:\n\n*\n\n*The keyboard itself\n\n\n*The keyboard layout\n\n\n*The driver\n\n\n*The operating system's implementation\nIt's therefore almost impossible to generalise this information. I've tried to be somewhat specific to Gnome/X.org using a Windows-style keyboard with one of the more popular layouts. To test your keyboard, you can run xev - its terminal output will tell you what modifiers have been detected for your keyboard.\nThe Macintosh keyboard has a completely different set of modifiers\nSome additional information:\n\n*\n\n*The Windows key is also sometimes called Meta. E.g. in KDE.\n\n\n*The Alt key is sometimes called Option, as this is its equivalent on Macintosh keyboards\n\n\n*The Compose key (not a modifier, but a dead key), also called Multi, is often mapped to the Menu key or the right Windows key.\n\n\n*The AltGr key I've mentioned is also called a third-level modifier. Each key on the keyboard has, potentially, four characters on it. The first level is the lowercase, then it goes uppercase, Alt + something, and Alt + Shift + something. For example, the four glyphs on my A key are a, A, æ and Æ.\nIt's all a mess :-)\n\nAs they've been addressed in the comments:\n\n*\n\n*The Fn is not really comparable. It's a hardware key that's not directly interfaceable by the operating systems. Pressing Fn and another key causes an entirely different code to be sent to the operating system. Examples for this include XF86AudioMute, XF86Eject and so on. The Operating system can't detect whether fn is pressed or not.\n\n\n*The SysRq key is traditionally a label on the Print Screen key indicating its function if used with the modifier Alt. It is sometimes, especially on newer notebooks, mapped to Fn+Alt+Print. In Linux, it provides a few Magic shortcuts.\n", "Q: How can I connect my HP Photosmart C3100 printer in 10.04 (regression from 9.x) My printer was working under 9.x.

It also installed GRUB2 onto the MBR.\nAfter discovering that there is no menu.lst anymore, I edited /etc/grub.d/40_custom to point to where my other OS partitions are:\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu 8.04\" {\nset root=(hd0,0)\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.24-28-generic\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.24-28-generic\n}\n\nmenuentry \"Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit\" {\nset root=(hd0,2)\nchainloader (hd0,2)+1\n}\n\nGRUB2 displays the menu with those entries but when I select any of them, it refuses to load them, saying \"No such partition\".\nI know the partitions are there, as 10.04's \"Disk Utility\" sees them without any problem.\nHow do I get GRUB2 to recognize them?\n\nA: Did you make your edited 40_custom file executable using a command in the form:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/grub.d/filename\n\nSee the tutorials:\nhttps://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195275\nhttps://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/grub-2.html\nAnd, of course, there is a series of steps in addition to merely editing the 40_custom file, along the lines of:\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo update-grub to get the current available kernels.\n\n\n*Copy the desired \"menuentry\" listings from /boot/grub/grub.cfg to /etc/grub.d/40_custom The entry begins with the line starting with \"menuentry\" and ends with a line containing \"}\".\n\n\n*Add any other \"menuentry\" items you wish to see on the boot menu.\n\n\n*Edit the titles of the \"menuentry\" line if desired (between the quotation symbols). Do not change the lines following the \"menuentry\" line.

Unlike legacy GRUB, GRUB2 starts counting partitions from 1, not from 0.\nThe key was the following instructions of how to \"convert\" menu.lst entries to 40_custom entries, taken from the following link        \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Creating%20the%20Custom%20Menu\nThe following entries from the GRUB menu listing must be changed for them to work:\n\n    * title is changed to menuentry. The line must end with {\n    * root is changed to set root=\n    * kernel must be changed to linux\n    * Any partition designation (sda4, sdb6) must be changed, as GRUB and GRUB 2 count the partitions differently.

I have a mouse with lots of buttons, but it's not a mainstream make like Logitech. For Windows, I have a driver that lets me assign actions like close-window (Ctrl+W) or next-tab (Ctrl+Tab), but I don't have a Linux driver. Since Linux is so flexible, I thought perhaps there is a general way to do this, regardless of brand?\nUpdate: Based on input from Cyrex, I installed and ran sudo apt-get install btnx which found several but not all mouse buttons.\nFound: left, right, wheel, wheelclick, thumb fwd, thumb back.\nNot found: wheel left, wheel right, thumb middle button.\nVendor ID is 0x04d9, Model ID is 0xa015.\nUpdate 2: In System>Prefs>Mouse there's a lightbulb icon for testing double-click speed. Every working button can turn the bulb on&off, but the missing buttons can't. It would seem that Ubuntu isn't aware of these buttons and thus doesn't register their clicks. I guess I need to hunt for a driver, though a mainstream mouse is probably the easier way. \n\nA: If all buttons are detected correctly then you can install btnx:\nsudo apt-get install btnx OR sudo aptitude install btnx\nThen go to: Applications -> System Tools -> Btnx\nIt has support for many types of mice\n\nA: Easystroke Gesture Recognition is designed primarily for creating custom pointing device gestures, but it can also be used to assign actions to simple button presses.\nTo use it in this manner,\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the configuration window.\n\n*In Preferences ▸ Behavior ▸ Additional Buttons ▸ Add, select Instant Gestures and then press the desired mouse button in the gray box.\n\n\n*In Actions, click Add Action.\n\n*Double-click in the Stoke column and then press the desired mouse button again.\n\n*Click in the Name, Type and Details columns to set up an action.\n\n\nA: If you install the CompizConfig Settings Manager  then you will be able to set a lot of window management mouse button shortcuts.\nIt may take some effort working out which button is which.\nIn the screenshot I am assigning opening the Super+Tab switcher to a left-click of my scroll wheel.\n\n\nA: I have a MX Anywhere \"M-R0001\"\nI use my forward and Back buttons as Copy and Paste. \nSteps:\n1) All buttons are detected with last kernel... at least with\nuname -a\n\n3.8.0-25-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 6 20:47:07 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n2) So, basically, you only need to map those buttons with desired actions. How to know with button is pressed and the correspondent numeric code? Well, you can use the 'xev' program:\nxev\n\nThis program is a key and mouse events sniffer. When it's running, you can see a window in which you can press mouse buttons and see if they are detected. For example, with the zoom button of the Performance MX you will see something like that:\nButtonPress event, serial 35, synthetic NO, window 0x5800001,\n    root 0x15a, subw 0x0, time 64521438, (84,117), root88,144),\n    state 0x10, button 13, same_screen YES\n\nthat means that 13 is the code for that mouse button. You can try every mouse buttons on your hand  ... for easy access, here is the map for Performance MX:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back button: 8  \n\n*Forward button: 9  \n\n*Zoom button: 13  \n\n*Show windows button: 10  \n\n\nthe other buttons are well recognized and you don't need to map to actions.\n3) Now, you need to install a little program to re-map mouse and keyboard inputs. The magician is 'xbindkeys' ... the easy installation is using:\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n\n4) Once installed, you can do the magic. The idea is configure the mouse buttons to send key combinations to activate other desktop functionalities (as the matter of fact, xbindkeys can be used for execute any other program when you press a mouse button). In KDE you can do that with Ctrl+F10 keys combination. The point is create a xbindkeys' configuration file to do the job.\n5) To create the configuration file, just run the following command:\nxbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\n\n6) And we need to edit the file to specify your button's mapping:\ngedit $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\n\n7) We need to add our button-to-key configurations. For example, I have the following:\n# Back changed to Copy\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key C' 'keyup Control_L'\"\n  b:8\n\n# Forward\n\"xte 'keydown Alt_L' 'key Right' 'keyup Alt_L'\"\n  b:9\n\n# Present desktops\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key F8' 'keyup Control_L'\"\n  b:13\n\n# Present windows\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key F10' 'keyup Control_L'\"\n  b:10\n\n8) There was a new requirement. the 'xte' program, which basically simulates user key press combinations. Install it using:\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\n\nNow, if you run on a terminal something like:\nxte 'keydown Control_L' 'key F10' 'keyup Control_L'\n\nthat means simulate a Ctrl+F10 keypress. The idea is using xbindkeys to say: \"when I press 13th mouse button, send a Ctrl+F10 keyboard press using xte program to generate that\"\n9) And finally, you need to configure 'xbindkeys' to run automatically on system startup. Startup Applications / Add program button and type '/usr/bin/xbindkeys' on the dialog.\nDONE \n\nA: Olli Salonen has his own ppa which needs to be added to your list if you want to install via apt.

I read somewere that Unity is a DE, is that true or not?\n\nA: It depends on definition of desktop environment. But I think Unity is not a DE -- there are no \"Unity applications\" (Ubuntu mostly uses Gnome applications), window manager is Compiz (not \"Unity-specific\"), desktop manager is Nautilus (from Gnome) etc.\nI think Unity is just of user interfaces for Gnome Desktop Environment.\n\nA: It's wrong. Unity is a window manager plugin (for Mutter or Compiz) and runs on top of Gnome.\n\nA: It depends on how you define a Desktop Environment. One definition is \"a graphical user interface that runs on top of a computer operating system\". By this then I would argue yes - Unity is a different interface and user experience.\nThe Unity website describes it as \"A powerful desktop and netbook environment things brings consistency and elegance to the Ubuntu experience.\"\nHaving said this, whilst GNOME is considered a DE then Unity does not completely replace GNOME by any means - the rest of GNOME will be used by Unity, only the very top layer is changed.

I've recently built a new system, after a rather large physical injury was sustained by my previous system (a precarious balance, and gravity, were not a happy mix).

However...\nI decided to use a fresh drive for / (and swap) partition(s), and another fresh drive for the new /home.

So you need to mount the new drive (find it by running sudo fdisk -l in a terminal) and add it to your fstab\nIf you can, please add a screenshot of disk utility as well, so we can see what it sees.\nI have a couple links here that explain how to add the drive to the fstab.

Is it possible to have the actual MySQL database installed on Windows and access it from Ubuntu 10.10 on the local network?\nI think I need a MySQL \"client\" ? So I looked here (MySQL Linux0Generic), but I don't know what to download..\nPs. I tried looking for documentation on the MySQL site but I can't see a single link for any type of documentation...\n\nA: Of course you can, you just need a few things set up correctly first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the MySQL Query Browser and Administrator These are both graphical tools that you can use to manage your mysql databases, no matter where they are.\n\n*On Windows you need to make sure the machine is available over the network via a name or fixed address so your Ubuntu machine can see it correctly.\n\n*Make sure you add permissions to access the database from non-localhost. In MySQL the default permissions are localhost only and you need to turn on the '.*' permissions for either root (if your managing it totally) or a user with the permissions you need.\n\n*Use the MySQL Admin you installed to test the connection by attempting to log into the machine's fixed ip or name with the username and password you've set up in the permissions.\nYou can also use openoffice.org's database to connect to mysql databases.

I would like to advertise my NFS shares via Avahi so that I can just browse from multiple machines without having to set it all up, especially when guests come over and I want something automagic.\nI am aware most clients will need extra packages (Like nfs-common) installed for it to work. The ideal solution will include instructions for clients as well (if any). \n\nA: My answer to question 18933 actually included an answer for NFS shares (although the question did not explicitly mention NFS):\nCreate a service description file (e.g. nfs.service) in /etc/avahi/services with the following content:\n<service-group>\n  <name replace-wildcards=\"yes\">NFS share on %h</name>\n  <service>\n    <type>_nfs._tcp</type>\n    <port>2049</port>\n    <txt-record>path=/path/to/someshare</txt-record>\n  </service>\n</service-group>\n\nThe port 2049 requires you to use the insecure option in the /etc/exports file, though.\nThen it should be possible to use your file manager, navigate to \"Networks\" and access your share. Unfortunately, The GNOME file manager does not provide support for NFS at the moment (Launchpad Bug #29263, thanks to João Pinto for pointing this out) and the NFS support in the KDE file manager is broken (KDE bug #184997 Now fixed) as well…\n\nA: NFS advertised shares are not handled by gnome-vfs at this time, there is a bug report requesting it:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/gnome-vfs/+bug/29263\n", "Q: How do I make my volume indicator operate in decibels instead of percentage? When I want to adjust the volume of anything I'm doing, I find that using the volume controls built into Ubuntu is little but confusion.  When the volume is around 100%, dropping it several increments has almost no effect on apparent volume, but when it's around 0%, the effect of one click of my mouse wheel is probably a good 3 decibels.  I have observed this behavior on tens of different UC's, since I convert about one Ubuntu user a month (NE team contact).\nThis has proven so frustrating to me that I tend to use the volume knob on my guitar amp ( mono audio :|  ) instead of the volume indicator. What can I do to make my volume indicator behave properly until this is fixed?  I want each volume increment to be one half or one third decibel.\nIs there a different piece of software I should use for system volume configuration perhaps?\n\nA: According to pulseaudio's volume control page:\nhttp://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/pulseaudio/doxygen/volume.html\nThe first problem might be the software doing some log calculations it's not supposed to do. (if it is then we need a bug report for that)\nThe second problem is impossible to fix, and that's the fact that the software can't know for sure what effect changing the volume by one degree will have in the real world. It can't know because of all sorts of factors.\n\nA: http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/5314/\n547 Ubuntu users have voted in favor of resolving this issue, and I think its about time that someone did something about it..\nMaybe the problem is being caused by a log calculation happening twice, at two different places in the chain. I'm not an audio engineer (or a mathematician), so correct me if I'm wrong, but heres how I understand it:\n\n\n*\n\n*A linear scale would be quiet from 0% ~ 85%, and most of the control would be within the 85% ~ 100% bracket.\n\n*A logarithmic scale would cause the dB or 'loudness', to increment evenly for each step of the slider.\n\n*A 'double' logarithmic scale would overcompensate, and cause the effect of a linear scale in reverse (ie. the 0% ~ 15% bracket controls most of the volume).\nThis is what the Ubuntu volume slider seems to be doing at the moment.\nAgain, I'm not an expert. I just know that theres a problem, and me and 547 other users would like it to be fixed :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.10 not normal boot screen \nPossible Duplicate:\nBoot screen in low graphics/text mode \n\nHi everyone,\nI have installed the latest ATI Drivers from AMD's website and everything's working fine.

Got a MacBook Air 3,1 11\" w/ 128GB SSD. Configuring for dual boot. I intend to have a shared drive where I'll store my media. What filesystem is best? \nThey say FAT32 is best for cross-platform compatibility, but the maximum size for file transfer is 4GB, which could be an issue for my media transfer. \nWhat's the best filesystem to share between OS X and Ubuntu?\n\nA: As seen in the comparison table here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Supporting_operating_systems\nThe only sure thing you have is FAT16 and FAT32. This is because HFS was left for HFS+ in Mac but HFS+ is not very \"compatible\" in linux just yet.\nAnyway if you want to have support fot higher file sizes you could try NTFS but here is the catch (Which is not that difficult anyway) you need NTFS-3G in both ubuntu and mac.\nUbuntu already comes with NTFS-3G which gives complete Read/Write access to a NTFS filesystem.

GRUB then either automatically boots Ubuntu or gives you a list of installed Operating Systems and lets you choose one to boot (people not dual booting will probably not see the GRUB interface below).\n\nGRUB 2\nA complete rewrite of the original GRUB (legacy GRUB). On the surface the majority of users won't notice any difference but the new version has fairly major structural changes and should be more reliable. The new version stores its configuration files differently, which means most online tutorials involving GRUB had to be rewritten. Other new features include the ability to boot LiveCD ISOs from the hard drive; support for other architectures such as PowerPC; theming and other graphical capabilities and scripting support.\nSince 9.10 Ubuntu has used GRUB 2 as the default boot loader for clean installs (prior to this it was GRUB).\nBURG\nAs for BURG  - the capitalisation seems to depend who you ask - it is a fork of GRUB.The main reason most users consider BURG is for the theming possibilities, replacing the two colour boot screen above, with (for example) the interface below.\n\nWe are unlikely to see BURG in default Ubuntu installs (at least not any time soon). The bootloader could be called the most important component of the Ubuntu stack - if it goes wrong you can't get into Ubuntu (or your other operating systems)! So such a major component needs to be fairly mature and well tested to ensure no breakage across the huge variety of devices Ubuntu is used on.\nAnd here's a quote from the BURG website:\n\nburg is a brand-new boot loader based on GRUB. It uses a new object format which allows it to be built in a wider range of OS, including Linux/Windows/OSX/FreeBSD, etc. It also has a highly configurable menu system which works in both text and graphic mode. Additional features like stream support and multiple input/output device are also planned.\n\n", "Q: How to enable OpenGL 2.0 and WebGL on GMA 3150?

I'd like to set a single directory inside Dropbox in which files are encrypted on a file-by-file basis.\nAt the moment, I use a 2Mb Truecrypt container inside my Dropbox which I then have to mount manually, access/change the files within, then unmount manually.  At that point, the entire 2Mb uploads to Dropbox.  This is a pain for a number of reasons :\n\n\n*\n\n*Dropbox sync will only occur when the Truecrypt container is unmounted, because Dropbox only syncs files that aren't locked and mounting a container locks it.\n\n*A single byte change to one file inside that container results in the whole 2Mb being uploaded again.\n\n*It doesn't scale - I was originally using a 10Mb container, but obviously the bigger the container, the longer it takes to sync when it's unmounted.\n\n\nI was wondering if I can somehow use LUKS to implement file-by-file encryption to get round the \"container\" issues.\n\nA: As far as I know there will be an integrated encryption mechanism in Dropbox in the future. (I so in feature's requests). In the meantime you may encrypt/decrypt files locally then synchronise them via Dropbox storage.\n\nA: Cryptkeeper allows for a per-file encryption folder to be set up as follows :\nInstall Cryptkeeper :\nsudo apt-get install cryptkeeper\n\nCreate an encrypted container :\n\nLeft click on the Cryptkeeper icon, then right-click on your new container and delete it (Choose \"Delete Encrypted Folder\").\nChoose \"Ok\" at the first prompt :\n\nThen choose \"No\" at the last prompt :\n\nNow you'll have a .Private_encfs folder in the directory you specified earlier.  Copy this up to Dropbox at the location of your choosing, then simply import that folder from the Cryptkeeper icon.  When you import, you'll be asked where you'd like your encrypted data to be mounted.  Choose somewhere outside of Dropbox and you'll have a fully encrypted folder integrated into Nautilus into which you can place sensitive files and the encrypted versions of those files will be uploaded to Dropbox automatically.\n\nA: I have two methods in place with my Dropbox.\nThe first is using CryptKeeper . This creates and mounts enc_fs encrypted directories, independent of the Ubuntu implementation of Private.\nInstructions by Scaine on using Cryptkeeper are here: How can I do individual file encryption on Dropbox?\n\nThe second is symlinking selected directories from ~/.Private into the Dropbox directory. This automatically uploads (and syncs) the encrypted versions of files normally situated in ~/Private. This assumes you have set up the encrypted Private directory! It can also be initially tricky to find the correct one to link.\n\nWhile neither of these is strictly encryption of a single file, as both use a container of sorts, both methods scale easily as only changed files are uploaded.\n\nA: I use TrueCrypt inside (gigabyte volumes) DropBox and you do not have to upload the whole container every time you change a file. On TrueCrypt GUI there is something called Preserve Time stamp just un tick it (google it) and you will only upload the parts of the container that has changed. Works really well – one thing to keep in mind if you sync with Mac is that if you click on your volume to mount it and you are tempted to select TrueCrypt to be associated with that file Mac will add a resorue fork which Linux Dropbox will refuse to sync. To fix it download FileBuddy on the Mack and use the delete option where you will be offered the option of deleting just the resource fork. Truecrypt has advantages the Cryptkeeper/ecryptfs-util does not have.

I usually upload them directly from Nautilus by right clicking the folder, using the ”Synchronize this folder” option, and then I make sure that the file I want to upload is published.\nThen I usually test the whole thing by trying to download it. I right click the file again to get its URL and I paste it into my Web browser. This usually works fine.\nBut yesterday I uploaded two compressed files – ”.tar.bz2”. When I tried to open them after downloading them with my Web browser (Opera), it failed. I found that the file was bigger than the original file (2358 B instead af 2335 B – 15 B added at the beginning of the file and 8 B added to the end), and someone at the Opera channel (IRC) at OperaNet (Europe) figured out that the reason for this is that the server compress the file again, ”without telling Opera”.\nSo to be able to extract the file I need to add ”.gz” to the file name and then extract it twice.\nIf I downloaded it with Firefox however, I didn't need to do that, so maybe Firefox figured this out somehow in a way that Opera does not.\nSomeone also tried to download the file with wget and some other browser and he also got the same result as I did with Opera, that is the file is compressed a second time by the server.\nI guess ”the server” is the Ubuntu One server, right?\nSo why is this? Could it be done better somehow? Or did I do something wrong when uploading the files?\nIt also seems like this extra compressing thing does not always happen, because when I tried again a few minutes ago, the file came down with its right size (2335 B), without an extra compression. But the other file (114 MiB) was still compressed twice.\n\nA: We do have an issue where we don't support the \"Accept\" header correctly and send compressed pages to clients that don't support it. We're working on fixing it, but it's pretty involved and doesn't affect a lot of our users, so it isn't high on our priorities.

In zsh, you can use the (On) glob qualifier. In other shells, the easiest way is to change the stem of the name as well.\n\n*A leading 0 in shell arithmetic causes the number to be interpreted in octal. 10#${…} forces a decimal interpretation.\n\n*printf %05d is a way to maintain the padding to 5 digits.\n\n\nA: I think this option doesn't exist in split.

Hello everybody and Prosperous and Productive Year 2011 !!!\nI have Ubuntu 10.10 (32bit) installed on my laptop. I would like to install PCLinuxOS (KDE or LXDE version, I don't know yet) on the same computer across with Ubuntu 10.10. I would like to test 'in real conditions' a new PCLinuxOS as well as to resolve my question regarding Audio CD playback issue (mounting DBus timeout error).\nI would be grateful if somebody can advise me how to perform the installation of another Linux flavour without breakdown :) of existing Ubuntu system ?  \nThank you in advance for advices and recommendations.\nHere is my current partitioning:\n \n\nA: Resize your /home partition to a lower size so it gives a small space for PCLinux. With the extra space insert the PCLinuxOS Live CD. Just install it like Ubuntu BUT when selecting the place you want to install, install the root in the partition space you just made. You can have the /home pointing to the same one of ubuntu at /home.\nSo for example it might be like this\n/dev/sda1        /       13.97GB\n/dev/sda2                451.79GB (It holds inside all the logicals. NO Resize this one)\n    /dev/sda5    /home       349.00GB (You made a 100GB Partition for PCLinux. 100GB Less Here)\n    /dev/sda6           2.79GB   (The same SWAP. Except if you want to hibernate)\n    /dev/sda7          100.00GB (Your new Partition for PCLinuxOS)  \nIf you want to hibernate and all that create yet another swap so not to have the hibernated information in swap when you login with the other Distro.\nAfter that when you finish installing PCLinuxOS you should see in the Grub both Distros.\nJust wanted to add, With this question in my head: What is GRUB (2)'s role in the suspend/hibernate process? there is now no need for 2 swaps. Grub will resume or tell you which Distro has been hibernated, so to not make a huge problem when booting. So it is almost safe to assume that you can have both /home shared and swap shared also. But need to take into consideration if you hibernated, WHICH one hibernated.\n", "Q: wakeonlan from remote host I have setup wake on lan service on my server. Everything works fine on local area network:\nroot@server$: poweroff\nuser@local$ wakeonlan AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\n\nand the server wakes up.\nAA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF is a MAC address of my server, which has IP 192.168.1.2 and hostname: example.com.

Now I'm able to wake the server up from local area, but how to wake the server from the remote location?\nI tried: user@local$ wakeonlan -i xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF, but it does not work (nothing happens;).\nDo I have to configure my router somehow to forward magic packets? How?\nThe solution\nAfter Ragnar's answer the solution looked very easy.\nBut actually, it was a bit tricky.\nMy router is Linksys WAG200g, which does not support Wake on LAN by default. Furthermore, it does not allow to forward to triplets above 254 (my broadcast address was 192.168.1.255).\nThe solution was to forward UDP port 7 to the address of the server, which was 192.169.1.2, then call:\nwakeonlan -i example.com -p 7 AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\n\nAlso I installed new firmware:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenWag200\nwhich is a great router options upgrade (e.g. adds Wake on LAN option).\nI also changed my netmask from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.255.128, so my broadcast is now 192.168.1.127 and passes the router validation rules.\nHere is the script I use to connect to the machine, and wake it up if needed:\n#!/bin/bash\n## This sends magic packets to Wake on Lan\n## please note, you must formard port 7 to the target machine on your router\n\n## host to wake up\nhost=\"example.com\"\n## mac address of the machive to wake up\nmac=\"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\"\n## user to login\nuser=\"administrator\"\n\necho \"Looking for $host...\"\nwget -q --tries=2 --wait=1 --waitretry=5 http://$host/\nif [ $? -ne 0 ];\nthen\n    echo \"$host is not available.\"\n    echo \"Waking up $host.\"\n    wakeonlan -p 7 -i $host $mac\n    echo \"$host is booting up.

Lucky you!\nfi\nssh \"$user@$host\"\n\nDon't forget to install: wakeonlan\n\nA: You need to forward UDP port 9 to the broadcast address in your network (192.168.1.255, or alike).\n", "Q: grub shows same linux image twice After a recent update, I get multiple entries for same linux kernel version in the boot menu.

Every language seems to want to make a big deal about having an automated system for installation, instead of working with existing systems.\nThe real solution is to install ruby and rubygems via apt and if the packages don't exist then you create the packages and host them in a ppa for others to install.\n\nA: $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1 gem1.9.1\npersonally I suggest ruby 1.9.2p94 or above since 1.9.2p0 has socket library bugs.\nNote $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.2 gem1.9.2 installs a binary ruby1.9.1 however when you run ruby1.9.1 -v it tells you ruby 1.9.2. I filed a bug with ubuntu and they closed it saying they don't care.\n\nA: If you're interested in using the latest versions of Ruby (I'd suggest using 1.9.2 as it's the latest stable version), then the best way I've seen of achieving this is to use rvm. \n", "Q: Can you add separators to Docky?

You can already arrange/group launchers however you want. That little bit of separation between them really doesn't give you anything worthwhile and we try to keep the feature set somewhat small and not present the user with too many options (we pick what we feel are the 'sane' options).\n\n\nA: Yes you can. :-) But its a little and not very pleasant trick.\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple create a fully transparent PNG with resolution of 32x32 pixels.\n\n*Create a launcher.

It would be good to know beforehand in case we choose the wrong option when asked and there is no turning back.\n\nA: I don't know if you're talking about a normal upgrade, which you do about once a week - perhaps more often, or an upgrade from one major version to another, but the answer is the same for both:\n\n\n*\n\n*Normally, no questions at all are asked\nThere are some, rare, cases (in both upgrades and release-upgrades), where a service or a post-install script will ask something, examples for this are\n\n\n*\n\n*msttcorefonts asking you to accept the microsoft license agreement\n\n*mysql asking you to set up a root password\nThere also can be cases where you need to decide whether to keep an old configuration file or replace it with a new one. You will be asked to either replace, keep or compare, in any case - if you didn't change a configuration file manually, it's normally safe to replace it with the new one.\nIf a question is asked of you, and you really don't know what to do, just hit enter (or Y).The default option will almost certainly be sensible.\n\nA: Ubuntu, with it's installer, tries hard to ask few questions only.   \nFrom my experience that works quite well; \nThere are two kinds of questions that are asked from time to time,\n(depending on the complexity and welstructuredness of the system being updated).  \nThe questions can moastly be separated into two categories:\nTrivial queries:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Packages that are being installed query the user for information\n\n*\n\n*on decisions like choosing an X11 display managers after installing an additional one,\n\n*or things like \"confirming\" \"license agreements\".\n\n\n\nConfiguration change conflicts:\n\n\n*\n\n*The installer attempts to update a package, but when routinely checking that, it notices that a configuration file was changed since the replaced package version, and the same file has been changed or replaced locally compared to the file the earlier version would have installed by default. \n\n\nObviously, the second category requires much more attention than the first, but they are not very frequent. When I updated my Ubuntu 13.10 to 14.4, I had to handle maybe four of these, plus two more \"obviously irrelevant\" (that was for a system in less-than-perfect state of administration).\nIn terms of, referring to your question, \"better being prepared\": These conflicts are sometimes hard to resolve, ie if the \"diff\" is noisy, or the background of the manual change is not clear. But it is possible to keep both file variants as backup and resolve it manually later. (That could leave the configuration of an important service incomplete or broken, so do take a note.)\n", "Q: Modify Multiple Images From Console I know convert changes from one image format to another. mogrify can resize and scale multiple images also. But how can I modify all images inside a directory, including the sub-directories. Like for example change every image inside a folder and its sub-folders from one format png to another format jpg, or resize all pictures in a folder and its sub-folders to a desire one?\n\nA: Since mogrify accepts a list of files, separated by line breaks, you can do this:\nmogrify -equalize $(find -iname '*.png')\nI use equalize as an example, but the important bit is the last one.\n\n\n*\n\n*The file name can be any expression that prints out a list of files, i use find -iname '*.png' as an example.

Could I issue the same command as; \"sudo dhclient eth0?\" Could someone clear up newbie on this issue?\n\nA: They are indeed one and the same:\n~$ ls -lah /sbin | grep dhclient\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root      9 2010-12-30 14:38 dhclient -> dhclient3\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   402K 2010-08-07 04:49 dhclient3\n\nThe arrow indicates that dhclient is a Symbolic Link that points to dhclient3. We can use \ntest -h /sbin/dhclient\necho $?\n\nto make sure it is; it will return 0, meaning yes.\nThis is sometimes done to maintain backwards compatibility with older programs and scripts that assume the old command.\nIf you are writing a program that uses either of those, you should use dhclient3, and manage your dependencies accordingly.\n\nIn ls -lah, the arguments mean long listing format, all files, and human readable file sizes. Also, test has nothing to do with symlinks, it's a general utility to test the truth of a statement, the argument -h causes it to work on files, and return True (0) if the file exists and is a symlink.\nTo find out where the file is, I used the type utility:\ntype dhclient\ndhclient is hashed (/sbin/dhclient)\n\nIf you find any two files that aren't symbolically linked, and you suspect they're still the same, you can use a Hash Function to see whether they're the same:\nstefano@lenovo:~$ md5sum /sbin/dhclient && md5sum /sbin/dhclient3\nfc2491e5c1576783bdc4aa8c5817166e  /sbin/dhclient\nfc2491e5c1576783bdc4aa8c5817166e  /sbin/dhclient3\n\n", "Q: Change Keybindings (hardware to software) I ran a search for this, but the answers I saw were referring to something altogether different than what I'm asking for. So let me clarify: I'm not asking how to change key-combo shortcuts. I'm asking--how do you actually change what your computer thinks you did when you press a given key?\nAn example of what I mean (and the reason I'm asking). I'm a Chrome user, and I use Windows alongside Ubuntu. I own a Lenovo Thinkpad T61p--it came with my scholarship package, and I would have shopped for a nice computer if I could have. The T61p has two buttons above the left and right arrow keys that relate to browser commands to go back and forth one page. This is extremely frustrating for me, as I use the arrow keys, and a single accidental keystroke will catch me going back a page, losing temporary data, and yelling at my stupid keyboard. At the same time, I'm the type of person who keeps way too many tabs open. Chrome doesn't let me refigure keyboard shortcuts, and the only way it allows you to switch between tabs are ctrl+tab and ctrl+shift+tab, and ctrl+page up/down.\nI was using Notepad++, and they had finally found the solution to both problems! The page back and forth keys functioned as tab back and forth keys. I went through quite some effort to learn how to change the keybindings in Windows. The page back and page forward keys are now the page up and page down keys, respectively, and if I hit control, they let me switch tabs easily, and rather pleasantly. And if I hit the keys by accident, no harm, no foul.\nAlas, I'm in Ubuntu now, and I need to go through the process again. And while I couldn't just find the answer online, like I did for Windows, I know Ubuntu has nice, supportive communities like this one, where, hopefully, somebody can tell me how to do either what I did in Windows, or directly make it so that my computer changes tabs when I hit those buttons (removing the ctrl button from the tab-changing command).\n\nA: You should be able to do this using xmodmap- see here for documentation and here for more information. The command will be something like xmodmap -e \"keycode <key code>=<key sym>\". \nYou can determine key code and key sym names for the keys in question by opening Terminal and running xev.

What if where Natty will be released, is it going to break my whole system ?\n\nA: Since you can install multiple kernels at one time, you will be fine when upgrading to Natty.  The upgrader will basically ignore that you have a custom kernel and proceed normally.\nAs for getting updates, that is up to the maintainer of the custom kernel to put the work in to keep the kernel uptodate.  Typically the goal of a custom patch maintainer is to provide the patch against the latest Ubuntu kernel.

At the point during the boot where it finds that the root filesystem is corrupt, the root filesystem is already mounted, and Ubuntu won't do a fsck on a filesystem that is mounted since that is unsafe.\nThe best way to recover from this is to boot the liveCD and run a filesystem check on it from there, when it is not mounted. You can use fsck from a terminal, or run gparted (in System -> Administration) where you can right-click the filesystem and choose \"check\".\nAlso, please note that Ubuntu 8.10 Desktop is no longer supported.

I've seen this question: Home network printer recommendations but I think I'm asking something more basic. I'm not really familiar with networked printers or how they work or what they do really. What I'd like is to have a printer that is accessible to anyone connected to my home network, without having to plug into the printer itself. \nAn alternative setup might to be to have a printer that is always hooked up to one computer, like a desktop, that is almost always on and allows other computers connected on the network to print to it as well.\nI believe the first option is called a networked printer and the second is printer sharing. But again I'm new to this so I don't really know the details or if I'm using the correct terminology. I was wondering if someone might be able to shed some light on this and let me know what is needed for either of these setup. Thanks.\n\nA: 12.04 and later\nTo share a printer attached to a computer on the network open the printer dialog from the menu on the cogwheel on the to panel side. Choose the printer with a right click and tick \"Share\" to enable sharing. Next open \"Server -> Settings...\" from the panel menu as shown here:\n\nThis will open the following window\n\nSelect \"Show printers shared by other systems\" on the remote client, or \"Publish shared printers connected to to this system\" to make them visible to others on the net.\n11.04 and earlier\nNetwork printing is an in-build feature that is fully supported by Ubuntu. To setup a network printer you have to allow network printing on the host printer server (System -> Administration -> Printing -> Server -> Settings) by publishing your shared printer:\n\nOn the client side you have to setup this network printer, again from the System -> Administration -> Printing Menu by adding a new printer and selecting Network Printer. You have to give the name of the host machine where the printer is attached to:\n\nThen, you will see the following screen:\n\nBy pressing 'Forward' a driver for this printer will be searched. Select the appropriate driver from the list and your new network printer is there.\nAlternatives\n\n*\n\n*By setting up Samba it is\npossible to print from a Wndows\nclient, or using a printer attached\nto a Windows host.\n\n\n*In addition there are routers that\nsupport printer sharing of a printer\nattached to the router. There is no\nneed to have another machine running\nthen. However it may be hard to setup\nthis feature from your router as\ndrivers for Linux are mostly\nunavailable.\n\n\n*Some printers have an inbuilt\nLAN/WLAN port capability where you\nare able to attach your printer\ndirectly to your network.\n\nA: You have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take any printer and hook it up to an always-on PC. The PC will be the printer server, and needs to be set up to allow printer sharing, as shown in the first part of Takkat's reply. (The client part is more or less the same independent of which printer sharing option you use.)\n\n*Take any printer and hook it up to a hardware mini print server, as suggested by Kendor. This kind of printer server is much smaller than a PC, it's basically just a USB port for the printer plus a network card. (Image courtesy Netgear.) \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Lastly, buy a printer with a network card included, then you don't need a separate print server. Look for a printer with either WiFi or Ethernet. For example in the Newegg advanced search, search for printers with network ports.\n\n\nPlain printing tends to work with many/most combinations of printer and OS. \nBut if you have/buy a multifunction printer, using the scanner over the network can be tricky. If network scanning is one of your requirements, make sure to get a product that works for your particular setup (i.e. where you can get drivers that support it for all the operating systems you use). I believe mini-print servers are out of the question in this scenario.\n\nA: Another option would be a hardware print server. These can be had relatively inexpensively, and the benefit is that you don't have to keep a specific computer on to use a printer. This describes how to use a Netgear PS121v2.

How can I fix this instead of reinstalling?\n\nA: In addition to @João Pinto's answer, you cannot use text editors like gedit or Kate. For the terminal or console, use text-based editors like nano.\nThe full steps needed to make changes to the ~/.profile file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl + Alt + F1 to switch to a text console\n\n*Login with your username or password\n\n*Restore your $PATH variable by restoring the environment so you can run nano without specifying the full path:\n. /etc/environment\n\n\n*Edit the ~/.profile file by running:\nnano ~/.profile\n\nUse Arrow keys, Page up or Page down to move the cursor. As with text editors like Kate, you can use Backspace or Delete to delete text before or after the cursor and insert text by typing it.\n\n*After making the changes, save the changes and quit the nano editor by pressing Ctrl + X, followed by Y to answer yes on saving changes. Finally, press Enter to confirm the filename.\n\n*You can now logout from the console by pressing Ctrl + D (or by executing exit)\n\n*Switch back to the graphical login by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F7 or Ctrl + Alt + F8 if F7 did not work.\n\n\nIf this does not work out-of-the-box for whatever reason, then we can always revert to karthick87's answer which Jasper added as an answer below: using a LiveCD to make changes.\n\nA: Changing the profile with PATH=xxx;export PATH will not prevent you from loggin in, at least not from the console. Switch to the text console with: CTL-ALT-F1, login, edit the file with your prefered text editor.\n\nA: Boot from a live CD and open your filesystem from Nautilus (not file system of live session). Search for the home directory, use Ctrl+H to view hidden files and then edit ~/.profile.

Windows installed fine but overwrote Grub. So if I choose the Ubuntu disk to boot first in BIOS I get a blank screen.\nI googled and followed this advice:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\nHowever, when I get down to this section:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/0d104aff-ec8c-44c8-b811-92b993823444 /dev/sda1\n\nI get this:\nAttempting to install GRUB to a partition instead of the MBR. This is a BAD idea…\n\n--recheck does nothing. Any ideas?\n\nA: The bad idea warning is caused by trying to install grub onto a partition rather than a hard disk. Having booted up your Live CD, \n\n\n*\n\n*when you run grub-install as per the Guide in the Ubuntu Wiki, make sure the hard drive you pass as an argument is /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1.\nThat is:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/[GUID] /dev/sda\n\nWhere [GUID] is the identifier of the disk you have found out using mount | tail -1\nHere's why:\n\n\n*\n\n*The master boot record, MBR, is the first 512 byte 'sector' of any partitioned\nhard disk. \n\n\n*\n\n*The BIOS searches this sector when trying to find a device it can\nboot from. \n\n\nIn the GNU/Linux system, your hard disks are all named /dev/sd[x], where x\nare consecutive letters. E.g.: /dev/sda and /dev/sdb. The first partition on the first disk is called /dev/sda1. The fourth partition on the seventh hard disk is called /dev/sdg4, and so on. At the very least, you'll have one partition.\n\n*These partitions are not searched for bootable data by\nthe bios.\nAs a result, grub-install [...] /dev/sda7 will issue a warning. You can install\nit there, but in almost any case, you shouldn't.\n", "Q: Setting up ubuntu as a wireless accesspoint I have an android phone which doesn't connect to ad-hoc networks.

I want to listen to the key press of lets say Ctrl+W in Rhythmbox, and call a functions if that happens. How can I do that in Python ?\n\nA: I assume that you are creating some sort of plugin. Plugins can be written in C or Python. I don't know how to do this but I know where you could possibly find out this information:\n\n\n*\n\n*The documentation for creating plugins.\n\n*The API documentation.\n\n*Asking on the rhythmbox-devel mailing list (rhythmbox-devel@lists.gnome.org)\n\n*Asking on the IRC channel (#rhythmbox on irc.gimp.net)\n\n\nA: Here's a base to get started:\n\nimport dbus\nimport gobject\nfrom dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop\ndef on_visibility_changed(visible):\n    if visible:\n        print \"Rhythmbox Shown\"\n    else:\n        print \"Rhythmbox Hidden\"\nDBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True)\nbus = dbus.SessionBus()\nrhythmbox = bus.get_object('org.gnome.Rhythmbox',\n    '/org/gnome/Rhythmbox/Shell')\nrhythmbox = dbus.Interface(rhythmbox,\n    'org.gnome.Rhythmbox.Shell')\nrhythmbox.connect_to_signal(\"visibilityChanged\", on_visibility_changed)\nloop = gobject.MainLoop()\nloop.run()\n\nThe two important bits are defining the function, see the API docs for what arguments it should accept, and connecting the signal to it. Again, the API lists those signals.\nIf you want to catch a signal defined in RBPlayer, for example, you'd connect yoru session bus to Player, instead of Shell. Unfortunately, the API is rather complex and not easily explained here. Have a good rummage through the Documentation, and you'll probably find what you need.\n", "Q: SVN with Lighttpd web server? I need to install svn on Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 9.04. On both servers I use lighttpd.\nI found some tutorials on internet explaining which packages to install with Apache, but i actually need lighttpd.\nthanks\n\nA: According to a posting in lighty forum:\n\nThere is no mod_subversion for lighttpd and there won't be one in the \n  near future. lighttpd is single-threaded (mostly) and mod_subversion \n  would block the whole server process (and so ALL connections).\n  Either proxy to apache or use svnserve which has almost all features \n  which mod_subversion has (the only problem I can think of is that Apache \n  supports several authentication modules (kerberos etc.) which can be \n  used in combination with mod_subversion, but svnserve doesn't support \n  that iirc).\n\nYour best choice is to use apache2 in combination with lighty: A great tutorial.\n", "Q: Can't access any functions after chown command I am not being to access any functions in my desktop and I don't have an OS besides Ubuntu and I am new to Ubuntu. I think I rebooted my computer thinking that Google Chrome crashed. I opened Google Chrome but it showed opening message but never opened so I restarted my computer. and when my system was loading (I was playing with keyboard  dont know what I typed) and  when by Ubuntu loaded, I was unable to access anything some of characteristics are listed below:\n\n\n*\n\n*I cannot hear any sound\n\n*I cannot access wired ethernet connection on the right corner where I usually enable to access internet and I have no internet.\n\n*There is no local apache server either. when ever I try to start apacer I get setuid must be root or something.\n\n*When I type sudo then I get message setuid must be root.\n\n*I cannot access orther external storage devices like pendrive and portable hard drive and cannot mount my other drives with FAT32 filesystem.\n\n*When I try to start my apache webserver with out typing sudo then I get message cannnot open socket or something like it.\n\n*I remember also doing command \nchown -R www-data / \n\nearlier and got error message\n\n*I cannot shutdown my computer, it only logs off\n\nA: The apache command you tried is clearly the problem, it's caused all sorts of files to now be owned by www-data instead of root, your user and a bunch of other system users that operate the machine.\nIt would be very hard to try and recover the machine in it's current state and instead the best action to take is to reinstall. Make sure you back up all your files first by booting a liveCD or liveUSB. You may need another machine in order to make the equipment you need to do the recovery.\nIf you are having a really hard time, then seek out a local Ubuntu service person who can help. There are businesses that offer servicing now as well as individuals from LoCo teams around the world.\n\nA: The most complete way to try and recover your system is with a reinstall. However you can try something to this affect which should produce some viable results.\nsudo chown -R root /\nfor u in $(ls /home/); do sudo chown -R $u /home/$u; done\n\nThis brings everything else on the system back into ownership of root, and home folders into ownership of themselves.\nSeveral system directories will need to be updated to different ownerships. On a close-to-stock version of Ubuntu they are as follows:\nsudo chown -R couchdb /etc/couchdb\nsudo chown -R mysql /var/run/mysqld\nsudo chown -R avahi /var/run/avahi-daemon\nsudo chown -R messagebus /var/run/dbus\nsudo chown -R www-data /var/www\n\nYou'll need to realize that there are other software and software configurations that may break because they are still not owned by the right user. Typically if you run\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure packagename\n\non that package it'll revert things properly.\n", "Q: How to activate pagination for ls command? What is the equivalent option for the ls command to activate pagination as in DOS the dir /p does?\n\nA: There's no straightforward equivalent in ls itself, but there's the less utility, which will format the output of any command as seperate pages, scrollable by line or page:\nls -C | less\nWhere -C triggers column display. Use lah as arguments (ls -lah) to get a line by line display with all files being displayed (include hidden ones), and human readable filesizes.\n\n\n*\n\n*To get colours to show up properly, you need to add the --color=always argument to ls, and the -R argument on less*:\nls -C --color=always | less -R\nthis shows 'ls -ah --color=always | less -R'\nIn contrast to more, less will let you scroll through the output. It's also a bit faster for very large listings. \nThe pipe works like this:\nEvery program has input and output, a pipe redirects the output of one program (ls) to the input of another program (less). And less simply expects input which it then formats. \n\n\n*\n\n*A more old-school dos equivalent would be pg:\nls | pg\n\nYou can also\n\n\n*\n\n*Use ls | head or ls | tail to display only the first or last part of the output\n\n*Use watch \"ls\" to keep the display open, updating it every few seconds to watch changes\n\n*Use banner $(ls) if you're sitting really far away from the screen. (;\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you find all of that too long to remember, you can set up an alias for it:\nOpen ~/.bash_aliases with a text editor and add something like this to it:\nalias lsp=\"ls -ah --color=always | less -R\"\n\n(this is a script that is run every time a new virtual terminal is started up, you should set up all your permanent aliases there)\nNow you can just type lsp, or whatever name you choose.\nIf you want to be able to pass further arguments to your alias, we need to define a function instead:\nlsp(){ ls -ah --color=always \"$@\" | less -R; }\n\nA function, principally looking like this: name(){ commands; }; can accept arguments, $1, $2, $3 and so on. $@ means \"every argument, if any\".\nYou can now run something like lsp *.py, lsp -C, and so on. We insert the arguments at the point where they get passed to ls. We could also have inserted $* for less, if it were the important command. You can see all of ls' arguments at man ls (worth a read).\n\n*: The reason for this is, that whenever you Pipe something, it detects a Terminal (actually the other program) not capable of displaying colour. \"--color=always\" forces ls to ignore this. The -R switch makes less repaint the screen, escaping the colours properly.\n\nA: I am not sure if there is some ls command for pagination. However, you may use a pipe and less, like this:\nls | less\n\nAnd use q to exit.\n\nA: Try ls | less or ls | more. The second one is close to the DOS version.\n\nA: echo 'alias ls=\"ls --color=always\"' >> ~/.bash_aliases\necho 'lsc(){ ls -C \"$@\" | less -R; }' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bash_aliases && source ~/.bashrc\n\nResult running lsc in a terminal\n\nA: Pagination can be done by using the following command.\n$ ls\n\nAbove command will print the out in a scrollable format.\n$ ls | pager\n\nAbove command will print the out in a paginated format.\nSome extra pointers:-\n\n*\n\n*Use spacebar to go to next page.\n\n*Use q to exit the pagination.\n\n", "Q: Possible to automatically display the correct days of the week? I'd like to tweak my Conky so it automatically displays the days of the week correctly. So for example, if TODAY were Tuesday, it would look like this:\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\n[etc.]\nAnd then tomorrow, automatically, it would look like this:\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\n[etc.]\nI know I can get it to display today's date like this:\n${time %A}\nBut how do I get it to display tomorrow's date?\nThanks so much for any help/suggestions.\n\nA: You can use the $execi Conky command to make what you want.\nThis command executes a shell command with specific interval and displays the output in conky.\nFor your need, you can execute the standard date command : \ndate -d tomorrow\n\nThis will return the tomorrow date using the standard output, but you can specify your output format using date parameters (see man date)\nSo what you need to enter in your .conkyrc script is : \n${execi 3600 date -d tomorrow}\n\nThe interval is in seconds, I set it to 3600 but change it with your ideal interval\n", "Q: How to configure Xchat and IRC server to transfer files? How do I configure Xchat to send files?\nMy setup:\nhardware router: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx example.com\n       |\nUbuntu Server with IRC server: 192.168.1.2\n\nLocal machines: 192.168.1.x\n\nMy aim is to allow to send files between the local machines. By now, they are able to talk on the local IRC channel.\n\n\n*\n\n*which ports do I need to open on the router?\n\n*what do I need to configure on the server?\n\n*how to configure XChat on the clients?\n\n*how to troubleshoot/debug the problems?\n\n\nA: The method by which files are sent in Xchat, and on IRC in general, is via Direct Client to Client (DCC).  A direct connection is established between the two relevant machines and the file is sent.  While IRC protocol allows any non-privileged ports to be used, Xchat uses ports 4990 to 5000 for DCC.\nIf you were sending files to machines on the Internet, since you have network address translation, you would need ports 4990 to 5000 forwarded to the machines doing the DCCs.  But since you are transferring files on your LAN, it is not necessary in this case.  If all internal routing on your LAN is open (which odds are it is, although I don't know), then the files should transfer without a problem, and without need for port forwarding or anything.\nTo send a file, I simply right-click a user name within Xchat and send the file.  To receive a file, I see in my main console Xchat window (usually) something like \"Dennis has offered motd (122 bytes)\".  I type \"/dcc get Dennis motd\" and the file is pulled.\nThe DCC file transfer in Xchat is a little buggy, if your Xchat window crashes during a file send/receive attempt, file a bug at Launchpad.  If that happens, your ~/.xsession-errors file would have be dated at or after the crash, and a line near the bottom would mention an xchat failure.\n", "Q: How do I get one monitor on top of the other? I'm using a laptop and a monitor (wall mounted) over my laptop. I would like to reflect this physical hardware setup in my software screen setup. So that I can move my mouse upward, out of my laptop screen and use the monitor on the wall. I have been searching for a solution for a while, and I hope somone can help me out.\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.10 \"out of the box\". Side by side screen setups works just fine, over/under is doesn't work.\n\nA: Use the \"Monitors\" application under System/Prefences and just drag the right hand monitor above the left hand monitor.

This causes massive slowdowns among the home network, rendering it nigh unusable.\n\nA: We've seen reports about this, but it always ended up being a perceptual issue rather than an actual one. The issue is that the way to limit bandwidth is sending a bunch of stuff and then waiting a while; this averages out to the requested bandwidth cap, but people (and monitoring tools) seem to expect a sub-second granularity, which we don't yet provide. All this is tracked in bug 600832.\n", "Q: Differences between fish and bash to pass commandline arguments to alias functions? From the answers to my other question here i learned about the possibility to pass commandline arguments to a alias function in Bash.\nIn Fish i can edit an alias by editing the file config.fish in ~/.config/fish directory and adding a line like this\nalias lsp='ls -ah --color=always | less -R;'\n\nand it works perfectly. This should be the equivalent to editing ~/.bash_aliases in bash\nBut when i try to setup an alias function to pass arguments like this\nalias lsp='_(){ ls -ah --color=always $* | less -R; }; _'\n\nit doesn't work for fish?\nAre there any differences between fish and bash in the way to setup an alias to pass commandline arguments that prevent this second alias from working with fish instead of bash?\n\nA: This second command is actually a small bash-script. Bash is the programming language built into the shell. It's used by other shells, but not necessarily, as we see here. \nFish defines a completely different programming language to bash, though it does support simple aliases in the usual alias name=command form; You should define a function instead. This is how you would define the above function in fish:\nstefano@lenovo ~> function lsp\n                      ls -ah --color=always $argv | less -R\n                  end\n\nand funcsave lsp so save it permanently.\nYou can now run the expected commands, like lsp, lsp -R, lsp *.png* and so on.\nYou can also 'invoke' bash to run a script for you, using the 'sh' program (this will run 'dash' to be precise). But if you're using fish, chances are you want to use the methods it provides. I've just tested it for the first time, and I'm very impressed so far.\nThe functions are stored as a file in .config/fish/functions/ in your home directory. The file name will be, in this example, lsp.fish. You can either edit the file, restarting fish afterwards, or just define and save the function again.\nThe best way to learn fish is by reading its built-in help. From within fish, just type\nhelp\n\nand you'll get a very nicely formatted, extensive and easy to read manual. Actually, this opens the w3m web browser, because the help is in html format:\n\n(press q-y to exit)\n\nA: I've never seen a contraption like this before.\nalias lsp='_(){ ls -ah --color=always $* | less -R; }; _'\n\nAn alias that declares a function and runs it. You should just make a function in the first place. In bash, functions supersede aliases in almost every way.\nlsp() { ls -ah --color=always \"$@\" | less -R; }\n\nPut that in your ~/.bashrc file, or if you prefer to put functions in a separate file, like ~/.bash_functions then you can do that, but you have to source that file from ~/.bashrc\n", "Q: \"sudo cd ...\" one-liner? Occasionally I want to cd into a directory where my user does not have permission, so I resort to sudo.\nThe obvious command sudo cd somedir doesn't work:\n$ sudo mkdir test\n$ sudo chmod go-rxw test\n$ ls -l\ndrwx------ 2 root     root  [...snip...] test\n$ cd test\n-bash: cd: test: Permission denied\n$ sudo cd test\nsudo: cd: command not found\n\nUsing sudo su works:\n$ sudo su\n# cd test\n\nIs it possible to make this into a one-liner? (Not a big deal, just idle curiosity :)\nThe variations I tried didn't work:\n$ sudo \"cd test\"\nsudo: cd: command not found\n$ sudo -i cd test\n-bash: line 0: cd: test: No such file or directory\n$ sudo -s cd test\n\nThe last one doesn't give an error, but it cd's within a new shell that exits by the end of the line, so it doesn't actually take me anywhere.\nCan someone enlighten me as to why this happens? Why is sudo cd not found, when for example sudo ls ... works fine?\n\nA: sudo sh -c \"cd restricted-dir; some-other-command\"\n\ni.e.\nsudo sh -c \"cd /root/restricted-dir; ls -l\"\n\nthe key piece is \"sh -c\" which I use quite often to run a chain of commands in the same shell context/process.\n\nA: Theoretically, the problem is that if you don't have execute rights to a directory, you shouldn't be able to read the contents of the directory. Now suppose you could do what you wanted:\nuser@desktop:/$ sudo cd restricted-dir\nuser@desktop:/restricted-dir$ ls\nfile1 file2\n\nAs you can see, you entered the directory using sudo privileges, then, when sudo returns, you become a user again, and you are in a directory where you normally shouldn't be.\nTechnically, the problem is the following.\nsudo cd restricted-dir\n\ncd is a shell built-in, not a command.\nsudo cd -i restricted-dir\n\nYou are probably in /root, but it would have the same problem as with the next one.\nsudo cd -s restricted-dir\n\nYou open a new root shell, cd into the directory, then exit the root shell, and return to where you began.\nAll in all, the only solution is to open a root shell and keep it open while you are in that directory.\n", "Q: Is there an alternative to rEFIt?

I already installed Ubuntu on my Mac with rEFIt, so if there's a better option, I can remove it now.\nI'm exploring, mainly because I want one with a more appealing UI. Other improvements are still very much welcome, though.\n\nA: It's been over two years since rEFIt has been updated, which is why I forked the rEFInd project from rEFIt. rEFInd includes a number of improvements, many of them related to directly booting Linux kernels with EFI stub loader support.\n\nA: There's elilo\n\n\n*\n\n*elilo (the efi linux loader), is the EFI equivalent of LILO, a linux boot-loader like grub.

Not 100% sure though.\n\nA: Grub is also EFI aware.\nYou may find more information here:-\nhttp://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=85508\nPersonally I would use Grub if possible.\nConsidering the amount of trouble I had getting my PC to boot from GPT partitions and the lack of documentation regarding EFI/GPT and Grub/Lilo I would say you are going to have a few hours banging your head against a brick wall before you are successful.

I don't like having to open terminal just to open synaptic. Any ideas?\n\nA: Since the common user does not have permission to install programs (Since installing programs is an administrative activity) you need to start synaptic as an administrator. To do this you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start synaptic through the menu: System -> Administration -> Synaptic\nOr\n\n\n*\n\n*Press ALT+F2 and type: gksu synaptic (gksu is to start a program in gui as administrator)\n\n\nIf you run it like one would normally would, just typing synaptic, synaptic will run with the privileges that the running user has. Since the privileges of the normal user are not administrative level, synaptic throughs that security message. At that level, you can only see the programs you can install and information related to them, but you can not install from the lack of administrative privileges.\nNOTE - If you edit the main menu and go to the synaptic option of the menu, you will see it also starts with gksu. That is why in the menu it works like it should.\n\nA: I have made a nice fix of this issue.

I've been finding fonts on the internet and installing them on my system. \nWhat's the easiest way to change my fonts? I would prefer an easy to use graphical way, but answers with command line recommendations are also welcome.\n\nA: Aleksandar is correct.  You can change the system font settings by installing gnome-tweak-tool (sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool).  However, it should be also noted that at this time, doing so also forces you to install all of GNOME-Shell, mutter, clutter, and about 20 other packages.\nIt's far from the end of the world, but it seems excessive just to change system fonts.  (Confession: I did it anyway :).\nI doubt it actually needs these things since the tool itself runs fine under Unity, however that's the way the package dependencies are currently set up.\nAlso note:  The fact that you can't change the system fonts from \"Appearance\" any longer is not a design decision made by Ubuntu developers.  These settings were removed from GNOME 3 by upstream GNOME.  That this change appears in 11.10 is a result of the migration from GNOME 2.x to GNOME 3 libraries and tools.\n\nA: In Oneiric (11.10), I wasn't interested in installing GNOME Shell just to change font sizes. This will do it via command-line:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface document-font-name 'Sans 10'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Ubuntu 10'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface monospace-font-name 'Ubuntu Mono 11'\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.desktop font 'Ubuntu 10'\ngconftool --set /apps/metacity/general/titlebar_font 'Ubuntu Bold 10' --type STRING\n\nThe fontfaces are the same as in default Oneiric, but sized down to what looked like much more manageable sizes.\n\nA: If you install Ubuntu-Tweak, you can change the font settings from their own tab. It is not yet at a stable version however, so the general \"use at your own risk\" warning applies.\nThe benefit is: you don't need to install GNOME-Shell.\n\nTo install it, first add this PPA:\nppa:tualatrix/next\n\nand then install ubuntu-tweak in the software center.\n\nThere is also another option, which is less \"official\", but works well. It is a font settings dialogue for the GNOME Control Center.\nYou can get it here: http://gnomefiles.org/content/show.php/GNOME+Font+Settings?content=146126\nExample:\n\n\nA: Use Gnome Tweak tool\nInstall it using the below commands in the terminal.\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nOnce installed goto Tweaks>>fonts\n\n\nA: For 11.04 and earlier:\nRight click on the desktop and select \"Change Desktop Background\" and then click the Fonts tab. Couldn't be easier!\n(NB: After playing with these setting you may wish to reset your font configuration.)\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 18.04 and later versions\nThe latest Ubuntu uses GNOME Shell. You can change the fonts using the \"GNOME Tweaks\" (gnome-tweak-tool) program.\nInstall the program using Ubuntu Software:\n\nAnd change the font and font size.\n\n13.04 - 17.04\nFor Unity interface users, customisation of fonts can be done using unity-tweak-tool \n\n\n\nFor 12.04:\nFor Unity interface users, they have their own tweak-tool. Customisation of Fonts in 12.04 can be done through myunity \n\n\nA: The gnome-tweak-tool now supports changing all Gnome desktop fonts.  \n\n\nA: gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.desktop font 'Ubuntu 10'\n\nWhere Ubuntu 10 is the font and size you want to use.

When I make some changes to the shell/bash behavior, such as setting up an alias, is there a quick command to reinitialize the terminal window instead of closing and opening a new window?\n\nA: If you mean reloading your .bashrc configuration then: \nsource ~/.bashrc\nFor less typing, you can replace source with a dot: . ~/.bashrc\n\nA: You have to replace the running application/shell with a new instance. E.g. if you are using bash as your preferred shell type the following line in your command line ($ is the placeholder for the beginning of your command line):\n> $ exec bash\n\nThe running application/shell is replaced by new instance of bash like starting from scratch. All your previous modification are gone.\nRemark: Do not forget that your terminal application may be reprogrammed. You have to reset your terminal application manually.\n\nA: Use exec sudo --login --user $USER.\nIf you also want the previously entered commands to disapper (full reset of the terminal), combine it with reset as reset; exec sudo --login --user $USER.\nTo keep the current working directory as well, use the following function:\nreinit(){\n  reset\n  exec sudo --login --user \"$USER\" /bin/sh -c \"cd '$PWD'; exec '$SHELL' -l\"\n}\n\nThere are many answers around the web but most don't actually work. Easy way to test is to set export SOMEVAR=42 then execute the supposedly resetting command and do echo $SOMEVAR. If it's 42, the environment was not reset.\nThere is also exec -c bash -l or exec env -i bash -l, but these are broken, somehow the $HOME variable is not set after this.\n\nA: Some Addition i found in the manpage from the reset/tset command\ntset reset terminal intialization\ncommand: reset \nTset  initializes  terminals.   Tset  first  determines  the type of terminal that you are\nusing.  This determination is done as follows, using the first terminal type found.\nan advantage seems to be, that it's independent from the used shell. also works with fish here.\nSo to reinitialize any terminal just do-\n$ tset\n\nOR\n$ reset\n\n\nA: An additional option to the exec bash is that if you changed your .profile (or .bash_profile), you can do\n$ exec bash --login\n\nThat will read your profile again as well.  It wouldn't hurt to add the -i option as well to explicitly tell bash that this is an interactive shell, but it can normally figure that out for itself.\n\nA: your shell is an executable you can call. So if you're using bash you can call bash and if you're using something else like zsh you can just enter zsh\n\nA: Use the terminal's functions clear or screen.\n\nA: On Ubuntu at least, . ~/.profile is better than . ~/.bashrc, because the .profile file also sources the .bashrc file, and it brings in other dirs, such as ~/bin to your PATH if those dirs exist.\n", "Q: How can I automatically shutdown the system after a specific time? How can I automatically shutdown the system after a certain customizable time?\n\nA: *\n\n*You can use gshutdown \n\n*After installation it can be found under Applications → Accessories → GShutdown\n\n\n*Also have a look at this method.\n\n\nA: Open a terminal window and type in:\nsudo shutdown -h +60\n\nand just replace 60 with whatever number of minutes you want to take.\nMore info here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-473173.html\nhttp://www.linux.org/lessons/beginner/l5/lesson5a.html\n\nA: Because the topic abt shutting down PC after certain period of inactivity is redirected to this topic, I will explain this issue here.\nI spent lots of time to solve this problem, so I find it useful to share it, to make the same issue simple for others. I hv tried different programmes but they haven't work for me so I found using short script with cronjob the best solution.\nFirstly I refered to post Timed Shutdown - shutdown after 30 minutes\nI will copy it below and then explain improvements to make it work:\n\nInstall xprintidle. This tool gives the idle time of a user.\nsudo apt-get install xprintidle\n\nMake a script autoshutdown.sh which checks for the idle time and\n  instructs the computer to shutdown if idle for 30 minutes.\nidle=$(xprintidle)\n\nif [ $idle -gt 1800000 ]; then\n    shutdown -h now\nfi\n\nMake a cronjob for this that checks from time to time if the system\n  has been idle for too long and if it has been idle for a longer than\n  30 minutes it will shutdown. Note that the cronjob has to be made for\n  the root user.\n\n\nThis script needs some improvements to work, like:\nidle=`env DISPLAY=:0 su OUR_USER -c xprintidle 2>&1`\n\nOUR_USER is the user we refer to for checking idle time (not root user)\nDISPLAY=:0 is correct for one desktop display (run env command to read DISPLAY in your situation)\nif script is run by OUR_USER, line above can be reduced:\nidle=`env DISPLAY=:0 xprintidle 2>&1`\n\nThis topic is described http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1069602\nif script is run by OUR_USER, shutdown command should be preceded by sudo\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\n\nMy script was run from cron by line in cron file:\n*/5 * * * * /home/OUR_USER/autoshutdown.sh \n\n\n\n*\n\n*every 5 minutes\n\n*OUR_USER should be replaced as earlier to the user we refer to.\n\n\n\nIf script is not run by root we should remember to add the line:\nALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown \n\nin sudoers file, so shutdown command won't need a password to be executed.\n\nI tried such cronjobs on 2 similar distro Lubuntu 12.04.4 RC LXLE 32-bit ( http://www.lxle.net/ )\nIn one system it works only using root cronjob set in file:\n/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root\n\nCAVEAT\nAnother problem is that xprintidle in my system has given sometimes random for me values and sometimes logically incremental. The final result - my system has been usually shutdown after 20 mins maybe, if I set the max idle value to 30 mins. I think the culprit is xscreensaver which doesn't work as is set by entered parameters.\n\nA: You can use \nComplexShutdown\nhttps://launchpad.net/complexshutdown\nor EasyShutdown\nhttps://launchpad.net/easyshutdown\n\nA: You can use sleep for that. They're used to delay/ pause an operation. Combine that with shutdown you get a power off timer.\nExample to sleep after 1 hour:\nsleep 3600 && sudo shutdown now\n\nYou can use math as well, here's to power off after 3 hour:\nsleep $((3600*3)) && sudo shutdown now\n\n", "Q: Unused services to disable after a fresh installation? Are there any services after a fresh ubuntu install, that are probably by most of the standard users not needed, so that you could recommend to disable them?\n\nA: This is highly subjective depending on each user. Most services that start up with the standard ubuntu-desktop are in some way required. However, you can disable a number of things which start up for each user in the Startup Applications Preferences, found in System > Preferences > Startup Applications - To disable a program from launching at startup simple uncheck it in the list under the Startup Programs tab.\n\nSome examples: If you don't use Evolution or, in particular, Evolution Calendars you can disable the Evolution Alarm Notify task. If you do not connect to this machine via VNC or another Remote Desktop tool you can disable the Remote Desktop server application. If your machine doesn't support Bluetooth you can also remove that service. Any service that you know you don't utilize while logged in as your user you can feel free to uncheck.\n", "Q: Automatically close application after custom time? Is there a way to automatically close a certain application after custom time? \nUpdate: i.e. stop the Audioplayer after a certain time.\n\nA: Perhaps you could alias the applicaton, or change its start up, so it fires off an 'at' command as it starts. 'at' can be used to schedule one off jobs to occur later on. 'man at' should give you the info.\nSo the next bit would be to start your process (without waiting for it to stop), grab the id, then pass that into at. $! should hold that, and ampersand will make it not wait. $* to pass through the original parameters will help too.\nTry something like:\n#!/bin/bash\n<your process> $* & export PID=$!\necho kill $PID | at now +1 hour\n\n\nA: Install gnome-schedule from the Ubuntu Software Center, load the program from Applications > System Tools. Use it to add an entry for the time you want the program to be closed like so:\n\nThis will kill all instances of firefox at a certain date/time, you can also have reoccurring events that kill off certain programs at certain times, for instance to encourage kids to not browse the internet or for killing certain games.\nIt is possible to do this kind of thing from the commandline too, but you need to know how to use crontab -l and how to write cron lines.\n", "Q: How can I Fix the CD/DVD refresh for the media drive so that it is recognized automatically?

I was wondering \n\n\n*\n\n*what filesystem types (such as ext2,\next3, ext4, ReiserFS and whatever might come\ninto mind) are recommended for\nvarious possible partitions (such as\n/, home, /boot, swap, and others\nthat might come into mind)and why?\n\n*if ext4 is now stable enough for use\nfor partitions in Ubuntu and Shared\npartition between Windows and\nUbuntu?\n\n*what journaling Options (writeback, ordered and journal) are recommended for each partition's filesystem?\n\n\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: Assuming you have checked in wikipedia, ubuntu forum, linux forum, linux sites about this very common question, i leave you here with a quick breakdown of the common ones:\nPOINT 1\nYou already know that ext4 is the enhanced version of ext3 which is the enhanced version of ext2 which is the enhanced version of.. you guessed it, ext (Extended File System) which was a better implementation of the Minix File system.\nI wil just copy paste a lot of stuff found in wikipedia / ubuntu+ linux forums /etc... since it is found easily but has a LOT of reading to be done to find the good points.\nExt - Solved 2 big problems that were found in the Minix System:  \n\n\n*\n\n*maximum partition size  \n\n*filename length limitation to 14 characters\n\n\nExt2 - Added several things that lacked in Ext:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Support for separate access   \n\n*Inode modification and data modification timestamps\n\n\nExt3 - Added More thing missing from Ext2:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Journaling file system  \n\n*Online file system growth  \n\n*Htree indexing for larger directories missing from Ext3  \n\n*Faster Performance Overall\n\n\nExt4 - Added a whole bunch of things, including but not limited to:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Large file system: Support volumes with sizes up to 1 exabyte and files with sizes up to 16 terabytes.  \n\n*Break 32,000 subdirectory limit found in ext3.  \n\n*Faster file system checking  \n\n*Multiblock allocator  \n\n\nReiserFs - Very good File System that showed potential and i tested some years back. you could see as an end user the speed difference between it and Ext3 for example. But after some \"problems\" the company working on the file system had to make some changes. Sad story really. Anyway the final problem right now is the lack of tools for it.\nReiser4 - Not available easily but is the \"Version 2\" if you can call it that of ReiserFS. Have not tested yet but some benchmarks show good progress.\nBtrFS - The illegitimate  child of everyone. This file system has taken the good of Ext3, Ext4, ReiserFs and Reiser4 added some sugar, mixed with chocolate and PRESTO! you have some super mutant ninja System. This is not a stable file system YET but it shows a LOT of potential and has some pretty amazing benchmarks. You can have a look here: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_1010_btrfs&num=2 but it still needs a lot of work before it can be called stable. Anyway some of the amazing things that it has, for my case, would be the Online volume growth and shrinking, Online defragmentation, Snapshots...\nI am using Etx4 right now since I already tested ReiserFs, Ext3, Ext2 and maybe 2 or 3 more.\nFor many small files in a partition I recommend Reiser since it worked wonders for me BUT you might get a problem that if it happens to you (It happened to me 2 times. That was enough.) you might loose everything forever. And I mean like FOREVER!.\nExt4 a year ago might have not sounded like fast and steady but right now it is very VERY good for almost any time of work in a desktop.\nSo my recommendation for your POINT 1 would be stay with Ext4. In the future, you might start looking at Btrfs but for now stay with Ext4. There is also the case of performance. As of December 2012, BtrFS does not yet have a similar performance as Ext4 does. In this case I am talking about cases like Copy/Paste speed, moving files, reading thousands of files, the stuff that end users do from time to time. BtrFS is more oriented towards scalable scenarios where we can play with several HDDs or huge space sizes, resize, snapshot and more. But even with that in mind, the work put in BtrFS is huge, so much so, that there are a couple of Ext4 developers that promote BtrFS for several case scenarios. In the future, the performance of BtrFs and stability will have improved to the point of becoming the default one.\nPOINT 2\nFor you POINT 2. I do not recommend it if you want to share files between Windows and ubuntu. For that case use NTFS or FAT32. Windows has some programs that can read Ext2/Ext3 systems but I have had (And 2 more friends had) a couple of problems with them, reading wrong, writing wrong, etc.. So for safety sake, stay with NTFS or FAT32 to be on the safe side.\nNOTE: What I mean with this is do the Ubuntu partition with ext4 BUT leave a small partition in FAT32 or NTFS to share files between them both. If you are working on the same PC for both Windows and Ubuntu, then there is no need to make a third partition for them. Just install Windows First leaving space for Ubuntu and then install Ubuntu. Ubuntu will be able to see the files in Windows (But Windows will not be able to see the ones in Ubuntu, but since you are running in the same PC anyway you will not mind anyway). Remember that FAT32 is limited to file sizes of 4.2GB or less. If you try to copy a file bigger than that it will throw an error. This can affect you if you want to store ISO files of DVD/Bluray. For this I would then recommend NTFS.\nPOINT 3\nFor you POINT 3 - If you want performance you can add noatime and nodiratime to your fstab for the ext4 partition so you get a small performance boost. This will eliminate the access times for files and directories (I think noatime removes both so there might not be a need for nodiratime) If you want more journal options you can check the GIT for the Linux Kernel where it shows you all options: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/filesystems/ext4.txt;h=7be02ac5fa36d7f4c07856fe9cf89391e08986f7;hb=HEAD\nThat will help you since it gives a brief summary for each option.\nHope this helps. Sorry for the long post.\n\nA: Yes, crasic is right about ext2fs not working with ext4 partitions. I tried it a while ago and while it could read some folders/files, the files were filled with garbage. It needs updating to work reliably with ext3/ext4 file systems.\nI think you should just go with the defaults as regards journaling options.\n", "Q: apt-get update stuck on \"Waiting for Headers\" when using Windows XP ICS I'm setting up a Maverick server on a spare PC. The install completes fine and the system boots up into the shell. However, when I try to do a apt-get update , apt hangs on almost every entry with the message  99% [Waiting for headers] sometimes a message of    96 b/s appears on the far right. The actual percent that it claims also varies. \nSearching around online gave a potential solution by using the option Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth=\"0\" this somewhat alleviates the problem, i.e. it stalls on every other entry with the same message as above. \nIf you wait it out (the whole update took about 4 hours), the update still fails as a good portion of the hits show a \"unable to connect\" or similar message, despite the fact that I can ping the server from the pc just fine.\nThe problem is also unrelated to the mirror used since I've tried about a dozen mirrors with no success, I've even tried commenting out everything but the main entry in sources.list and it still refuses to update.\nThe network connection is fine since I can ping and wget (apt won't let me install lynx until I run a successful update) just fine. I've also reinstalled the distro with no luck.\nThe only thing weird about the setup is that the PC is connecting to the internet through my windows laptop with ICS configured properly, but as I've said before, the network connection is fine. \n\nA: There are some rumours in the web (I can't verify them) about ICS problems with IP6. They said when ICS receives more than one IP6 connection it halts for a while. This could explain why wget works (only one connection), and apt-get update fails (lots of simultaneous connections).\nYou can try to disable IP6 in your server to test if this is the problem.\nYou can disable IP6 from the terminal with:\necho \"#disable ipv6\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\necho \"net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\necho \"net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\necho \"net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nThen reboot and check if you can update. If it works at least you know where the problem is. You can either disable IP6 permanent, or plan a new setup. Note that IP6 disabling will be a temporal hack, IP6 seems like unavoidable in the near future.\nTo enable IP6 back, delete the previous lines from /etc/sysctl.conf and reboot.\n\nA: There seems to be a fundamental issue with the implementation of ICS and IP forwarding in general on Windows XP it simply cannot handle multiple connections to the same server, maybe it's some weird combination of a bug with intentional incompetence (as I like to call it), but the end result is that XP cannot function as a competent router/proxy for a linux system (maybe the limitations are intentionally put in place for non-windows systems). \nIt is interesting to note that this is not only limited to ICS. There is a hidden option in the windows registry that allows IP forwarding for network interfaces and it suffers from the same problem.\nThe only solution - it appears -  is to either change the network topology to avoid using ICS (either connecting directly, or buying a dedicated switch/access point), or to use a different OS to set up the temporary bridge. I used an ubuntu live-cd (it wasn't my computer or it would have been running some *nix to begin with) and enabled packet forwarding and ip masquerading so the computer behaves as a bona-fide router.\n", "Q: For better performance should I install 32-bit or 64-bit? I don't know much about 32 bit and 64 bit. I had been using 32 bit and it's crashed (not working properly and i don't know how to recover) question here..... and i don't have backup and i run on 3.2 dual core intel processor can you recommend me which would be better, and i do web development(php and mysql) and learning python.\n\nA: If you dont have any specific reasons for installing 32 Bit then you should go with 64 Bit. At the following URL you can find the performance comparison of 32 Bit and 64 bit linux versions.\nhttp://www.tuxradar.com/content/ubuntu-904-32-bit-vs-64-bit-benchmarks\nYou can see that 64 Bit is faster in many places. You can also have more than 4GB ram in 64 Bit but not in 32 bit. Also there is ubuntu community help page here and they also suggest installing 64 bit.\nI am running Ubuntu Lucid 64 Bit on my machine and I dont have any problems. All applications that I need are in the repos and everything works. Back in 2009 I tried 64 Bit version of Intrepid but reverted back to 32 Bit because many softwares didnt have 64 Bit versions then but that is not the case now.\n\nA: If you have more than 4 GB of RAM go for 64 bit else 32 bit is just fine.\n\nA: As for this question: If you plan to re-install your operating system completely, choose the 32 bit version. There's really no need for you to try 64 bit. \nBut it's really not that important. Ask another question here about how to best do that re-installation, keeping your data. Make sure to explain your situation in detail, what hardware you have available (hard disks, usb sticks, cd drives, ..), how your hard drive is partitioned and so on. If you need help figuring all of this out,you can join the Chat room or search the site.\nYour problem is quite a difficult one. But we'll help you as best we can.\n\nA: I find it quite amusing that the usage of 64bit is so closely bound to memory in the machine. 64bit means as well that per processor cycle you are able to process twice the amount of data comparing to a 32bit operating system.\nUse 64bit in case you do\n\n\n*\n\n*video editing and processing\n\n*sound editing and processing\n\n*graphic editing and processing\n\n*work with large files (e.g. databases, large log files, ...)\n\n\nI am doing a podcast and using 64bit with my notebook saves a lot of time when doing audio processing (noise reduction, normalizing, compression, ...). My notebook only has 2 GB of RAM.\n\nA: I've been running 64-bit Kubuntu for years without an issue. I think that any objections to 64-bit are just FUD and you can ignore them.\n\nA: There are no big performance differences between 64 bit and 32 bit in Ubuntu. I tried both for years now. Let me point to the actual PROS and CONS for the 64 bit since you have been in the 32 bit already:\n64 bit PROS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Support for more than 4 GB RAM (without any kernel modifications, 32 bit PAE support, etc..) The sucker supports more than 1 TB.\n\n*Gives performance boosts ONLY if you are doing some very intense work that needs more than 4 GB Ram. Am not talking about playing, watching videos or listening to music. Am talking about server with a million users, rendering shrek 7 christmas edition or something very big like making a 3D version of the galaxy.... from scratch.\n64 bit CONS:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the past (2012 or less) a whole bunch of programs had issues. For example flash (even the 64 bit version) had some glitches and more. If you thought you had issues with 32 Bit on those times, changing to 64 bit increased your chances of having more. For me it was a nightmare on PC street. This obviously changed and it changed very quickly. Since 13.04 I would say, 64 bit got much more stable, easier to work with and it was very hard to get a 64 bit problem. On 13.10 I did not have any issues whatsoever. Now on 14.04 it is more recommend than ever before to move to 64 bit but only if you have the following hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have a PC with 4 GB or more of RAM\n\n*Have a motherboard that supports 64 bit (Most motherboards after around 2005 do)\n\n*Have a CPU that supports 64 bit (Most CPUs after around 2004 do)\n\n\n*Recommended for the average user that has 4 GB or RAM or more and hardware that supports 64 bit architecture. There are many issues still in the 32 bit that will get even bigger in the 64 bit one. Apart from that 64 bit is still very new (Even if it came out around 2000) but the majority of the programs made (Even today) are mostly for 32 bit.. Nowadays, 64 bit is the best move. When I wrote this answer it was January 2011. We are now in April 2014 and I can really say that 64 bit is much better than 32 bit in terms of performance, stability and more. Of course, the need for a program to use even close to 4 GB is not yet a big problem and the real need to use more than that applies to intense apps.\nTest out 32 bit if you want but if you have a computer with enough RAM, CPU and a good motherboard (From 2005+) then I would really recommend 64 bit for you.\nHope to have helped.\n\nA: One relatively new reason to use 64-bit: if you are interested in virtualization, Docker does not run on 32-bit kernels (as far as I know).\n", "Q: How to reinstall Ubuntu keeping my data intact? I want to reinstall Ubuntu keeping my data intact. I have 160 GB hardrive (sata or pata I don't know but it's slim and made in China) with a 40 GB ext3 partition, a 4GB swap memory and 3 other partition with a FAT32 file system. I have around 4GB space on my drive where Linux is installed.\nI'd like to keep the data intact, especially the Downloads folder, desktop, and /var/www; And I no longer have access to any other machines or external storage devices.\n\nA: Just copy the directories that you want to save i.e Downloads, /var/www and Desktop to another partition, install Ubuntu to that 40 GB ext3 partition and after installation copy the directories back. \n\nA: In the installer, choose the option for advanced partitioning, then select your existing / or /home partition. In the box that appears, make sure the filesystem selected matches the existing filesystem of that partition, and that the format box is not checked. Proceed as normal through the rest of the options.\nCopied from a comment by Evan on a previous Ask Ubuntu question: What's your recommendation on drive partitioning schemes for a desktop and home server?\nAccording to the comment this will only preserve /home, /usr/local, /usr/src, and /var/local, so you will probably have to move /var/www and anything else you want to preserve into your /home directory (at least temporarily) to prevent it from being overwritten.\n", "Q: Music bought from ubuntu one music store stuck on \"Transferring to your Ubuntu One storage\" I bought music from the Ubuntu One music store, and the status of the downloads are stuck at \"Transferring to your Ubuntu One storage\" under the \"My Downloads\" section of Ubuntu One Music Store.

For the most part 64bit is vender neutral.\n\nA: it Doesn´t matter if the distro says \"amd64\" it can be used on any x86-64 CPU, it´s only indicating the architecture it supports , x86-64-bit.\nYou can safely use any of them.\n\nA: As the others have said, AMD64 and Intel 64 are the same thing.\nNow this is really picky and unnecessary, but I'll add it for completeness' sake:\nThe 64 bit image is called amd64 because it refers to the Instruction set rather than the CPU. When CPUs became 64 bit, there was a bit of a fight between the AMD64 instruction set, which just just an extension of the x86 instruction set developed by Intel (and first seen in the 386 processor), and the IA-64 (Itanium) instruction set, which was completely new and incompatible.\nIn the end, all of the vendors (Intel, AMD and Via) have used the AMD64 instructions, slighly modified in each case. They are now known as AMD64 and Intel 64, but based on AMDs first implementation. All of this mess is now commonly called x86-64 (not by Ubuntu, yet).\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a proposal on Ubuntu Brainstorm to get rid of this terminology.\n\n*There's also a Bug Report for it, marked as \"Won't fix\", referring to that brainstorm idea.\n\n\nMarco Ceppi also notes:\n\nThe reason AMD is there, is because intel reverse engineered 64bit capabilities from AMD. Out of respect the AMD moniker is left to give credit where due.\n\n\nA: As long the 64bit edition is not declared stable, install the 32bit (recommended for 10.10) version. E.g. Adobe is working (right now) on a final 64bit solution for flashplayer; maybe 10.2 will have native 64bit support for Linux -- we will see. Otherwise you have to look for an workaround.\nIf you are using more then 3.4GB of RAM install the PAE Linux kernel to activate the upper memory:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-pae\n\nI do not like to talk about advantage/disadvantage of 32bit VS 64bit because your have but the same Linux kernel file is compatible with Intel and AMD so you can not run in trouble if your CPU is 64bit capable.\n", "Q: Prevent new options being added to grub after kernel updates? Every time I new kernel update is installed to my system, it adds itself again to the boot menu. Right now my boot menu has 3 linux option, one for each kernel version.\nhow can I avoid that new options to be added?\n\nA: Maybe it's not the best idea to always remove the old kernels! You may experience some bugs with the new kernel, or other problem, you can't know. Then you can boot with the previous kernel to \"save the day\". Without that option and with a crash (always) during the boot would render your system unusable (sure you can help with a boot CD or so). Ok, it's not so frequent, maybe I can can mention a single happening like this with me since 6 years, or so. But it's very nasty if happens. I would recommend to keep at least two versions, the newest and the one before it: you can boot the older if you experience any problem. Anyway, you can remove the old versions if you really want:\napt-get --purge remove linux-image-...\nwhere the \"...\" means the same character-string you can see in /boot after file names initrd.img- or eg vmlinuz- so an example:\napt-get --purge remove linux-image-2.6.35-24-generic For sure, you can remove packages by Synaptic Package Manager as well, if you prefer GUI more than using command line.\nBe careful not to remove kernel which is currently running, you can check the current one with this command: uname -r\nAnd a little comment: your question is a bit misleading: you should not ask not to add new options after kernel updates, since the important thing here to have a newer, updated kernel. What you need (maybe) is to remove older ones, so it's really about removing older ones.\n", "Q: Screen is rotated. How to adjust it?

Normally one would right click on the panel and choose the correct option in the menu, but...my panel is full and there's no empty space to click on :p.\nHow can I access the panel menu?\n\nA: When a panel is full, you can't right click anywhere to \"Add to Panel\".  Perhaps this was by design, but overlooked things like dynamically resizing widgets like the Window List which fills blank space.\nSo when your panel is full, you have only one option - remove something (that you know how to easily re-add), then right click on the now-empty space and add what you need.\nYou might also want to consider right-clicking on the panel, choosing \"Properties\" and ticking the \"Show Hide Buttons\".

I already googled a bit and found a good example on GtkStatusIcon.\nCould I also use Libindicator for this task?\nRef: https://launchpad.net/libindicator\n\nA: GtkStatusIcon is not supported in Unity.\nIf you need an icon displayed use Application Indicators instead. They are quite easy to handle but one drawback is that custom icons are not officially supported yet (see this question here), and that application indicators may not be available in other distributions.\nIn addition, defining custom icons as suggested here does not work in early versions of Application Indicators used in 10.04 LTS.\nTherefore you may need that your program checks if Application Indicators are present, and in addition checks the version they have in order to get them running properly. If Application Indicators are not provided or if your application should also run in other distributions you can also use GtkStatusIcons. In this case you will have to program for both paths as was suggested here. \nAs far as I can see today GtkStatusIcons will still be supported when running classic GNOME Desktop in Ubuntu 11.04 but I don't know about GNOME3.\n", "Q: Is there a way to enable the media keys when the screen is locked?

To avoid this case, the windows port kills all the process that are ran by the application except those that are performing a sync with the server.\nWhat you are experiencing is the sync process working until it finishes. This is a feature added to the beta because we(it was me actually) considered that it was worse to have a corrupted sync in which you data could be removed than to use extra CPU until the sync is done.\nThis will remove as soon as we have a continues sync in the application in which the metadata will keep synced in a much smarter way.\n", "Q: Is there an official Ubuntu free technical support team? I have found that there is an \"Ubuntu Support Team\" at https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-helpteam but I am not sure it's official or active.\nPlease note that I am not referring to bug fixing support, I am referring to the broader OS support, with people available to engage users needing support with a problem and drive it to a proper resolution.\nIs there an official team for this purpose with a clear scope and activity plan ?\n\nA: It would appear the \"Ubuntu Support Team\" that you mentioned has been inactive for over two years. (In fact I don't think it was ever really 'active').\nThere are four main places to go for community support:\n\n\n*\n\n*IRC channel #ubuntu - personally I wouldn't advise it because it gets very chaotic\n\n*The Ubuntu Forums\n\n*Launchpad Answers\n\n*Ask Ubuntu\nYou might want to take a look at When should we use Launchpad Answers and when Ask Ubuntu.

Recently when I tried to open a video with VLC, my system slowed down, the open applications webbrowser, VLC and filemanager and others didn't react any longer. The mouse just reacted still very slowly.\nOn a windows machine i would press a keycombi CTRL-ALT-DEL to open the taskmanager, search the process which caused the hang and kill it.\nSince i'm fairly new with the use of linux i haven't figured out the best practice for solve such a situation in Ubuntu.\nWhich quick and effective way would you recommend to identify the hanging process and close it, when the system already reacts very slowly on user input?\n\nA: Add the System Monitor applet to your panel (right click on the panel, select Add to Pannel and search for System Monitor) the  and right click on it to open the System Monitor application.\nYou can launch the System Monitor application by pressing Alt+F2 and start the program gnome-system-monitor.\nGo to the \"Processes\" tab and right click the appliction you intent to kill.\n\nA: There are two primary ways to identify hung processes. One is via the System Monitor GUI and the other is via top in command-line.\nSystem Monitor\nThis can be found in System > Administration\n\nYou can also create a keyboard shortcut for this in this article.\nOnce the GUI launches you can select the Processes tab which will list all the running processes. Sort by the CPU column to find the most CPU intensive task\n\nLastly you can right click that task and choose to end it, stop it, or kill it. Killing it will immediately stop and remove that process from the system.\n\nCommand-Line\nIf you have a terminal open you can simply type top this will list all the running processes similar to that of the Processes tab in the GUI\n\nWithin top it is CPU sorted by default - so the top most CPU intensive tasks are at the top. At anytime you can press the letter k to kill a process\n\nSimply type the PID of the process you wish to kill and press enter. It will ask for a Kill signal to send. To kill the process nicely use the default 15 - to kill it right away \"Do not pass go, do not collect $200\" use 9.\n\nThe process will then be terminated.\nIf you are experiencing sluggish interface you can try to SSH in remotely if that is enabled - or switch to a virtual console via Ctrl+Alt+F# Where F# is a Function Key (F3, F4, F5, etc). To return to the Desktop environment switch to either F7 or F8 depending on your version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: Most already said (I like Marco Ceppi's answer) but there also is a \"Force Quit\" applet you can add to your GNOME Panel. Right click on the panel and choose \"Add to panel...\":\n\nThis lets you quit a hanging application by simply clicking on it's window. Very fast and efficient.\n\nWhen running Unity in 11.04 of course this application will no longer be available. There is a replacement project Indicator-Forceclose but it is not included in the repositories.\nAlternatively we could run xkill from a terminal.\n\nA: $ ps -el|grep ProcessName\n\nabove command list out all processes named ProcessName. then kill process with its PID.\nExample.

I now want to access that info on my ubuntu machine and the drive isn't mounting. I've floated around the help files and I am not finding anything that works.\nthe drive is firewire LaCie\nMy jolicloud machine sees it no problem. Ubuntu on the other hand does not.\n\nA: When you had the drive plugged into Windows, did you go to the bottom right hand of the screen and click Remove Hardware?  Drives will not mount unless you plug it back into a Windows PC and then do that step, then plug it back into your Ubuntu PC and it will be recognised and will be accessible for use.\n\nA: So after walking away from my laptop for a while, I came back and out of no where it recognized the HDD.

I believe in totem though tyou can automatically load subtitles if they are in the root dir of the movie. \nGoodluck!\n", "Q: Why does Chrome have so many processes on my machine? I've got almost 20 processes for google chrome (whilst only having 4 tabs open, all with barebones HTML) , all hogging memory and either saying futex_wait_queue_me or poll_schedule_timeout. \nMy fan is going wild by all this and one of the processess is eating up my entire CPU, what is happening?\n(Happens to Chromium too)\n\nA: Chrome renders each page (tab) in a different process. This makes it faster on multi-processor machines.\nThe behaviour you're seeing is normal.\nfutex_wait_queue_me refers to a type of mutex lock (fast userspace mutual exclusion) that is used to schedule many processes work on one processor. The state indicates that your process is enqueued to receive the lock. \nSometimes, an unusually high amount of waiting for a lock can be caused by cpu throttling, but most often, it's normal. Take a look at the sort of website you have open; Perhaps something like Flash is causing the high CPU load. \nTo see what tabs or plugins are slowing down your system or filling up your memory, you can use Chrome's built in task manager:\n\n\nIn my example, omgubuntu's javascript uses a lot of cpu. \n\nA: Having multiple processes is a normal behavior of Chrome/Chromium.\nfutex_wait_queue_me or poll_schedule_timeout status for those processes seems okay.\nYou could use the system-monitor to see if one particular process is using too much cpu. Sometimes buggy javascripts or flash programs start using all the cpu.\nIf you think this is the case, make sure you do not have any unsaved data in some web apps and just terminate the process. Chrome will then propose you to reload the page. It usually solves the problem.\n", "Q: How do you connect remotely from another country? Normally, I installed Ubuntu for people with little experience with computer. These people's tasks are simply email, office work, and some more chit chat online. If I am with them, I can troubleshoot their troubles. However, if I am abroad, this can be a little bit of trouble.\nIs it possible to connect to a specific Ubuntu machine from a computer on another country and gain root access level?\n\nA: You can use Team Viewer it can work beyond proxies.\nInstalling Team viewer:\nFor Ubuntu,you can download the teamviewer here. Once downloading is completed, you can install it easily by double clicking the .deb file.After installation you can find team viewer under the Internet Menu(Applications → Internet).\nOpen the Team Viwer:\nApplications → Internet → Team Viwer\n\nBefore establishing the remote desktop connection,you must know the ID and Password of the remote system which is running Team Viwer.After getting the ID and Password from your partner.Enter the ID and click connect to partner, with in few seconds it will show a window prompting for a password.Enter the password which you got from your partner and click ok.\nNow you are connected to remote sytem.\nNote:\nTo establish the connection, Team viewer must be installed in both the system. \n\nA: I think you may use Team Viewer. It is free & cross-platform, also works on your mobil device. \n\nYou can use it for remote control of your own computer, and help for other people.\nSee the complete features here.\n\nA: I do agree, Teamviewer is easy to setup and handle even for non too experienced users. However Ubuntu built-in VNC can do the same job without the need of trusting an external commercial company. However both depend on a working desktop environment, which may be not the case when your support is needed.\nFor this situation you can install openssh-server on the remote side. Then you can login to the remote computer via SSH in terminal mode. Permissions are given according to the permissions from the user account you login.\nFor further reading see also the Community Wiki.\n\nA: If you take the SSH route, you can also use NX, http://www.nomachine.com/.\nNX forwards X though SSH.\nWhat I do: give one of the workstations or a server inside the LAN a static IP address;\non the router, forward port 22 to the static workstation or server;\nset up dynamic DNS (no-ip.com or dyndns.org) so that you can find the workstation\nanywhere in the world by its current external IP address.\nThen use unencrypted VNC to go from that workstation to others within the LAN.\nThere's also www.LogMeIn.com, which works fine.\nIt's simple, and it works.\nChris\n\nA: There are several issues that need addressing.\nAre the other computers behind a national or local firewall?\nDo the other computers have a globally addressable IP?\nAre there several computers on the same local (home) network behind a router?\nBy far the easiest way for both you and your users will probably be some sort of remote assistance program like team viewer. Depending on how teamviewer is set up, they might need to open a port for it in their router/firewall.\nIf you need to administrate the computer (as opposed to assist user issues) then there are several more powerful options. If the computer is exposed to the internet, you can simply ssh into the computer to perform all administrative tasks, ssh also does X forwarding although it is pretty sluggish, I prefer NX for remote desktop/X forwarding situations. screen has some useful pedagogical features, since all users logged into the same screen session see the same terminal, you can use (and I have done this) screen as a very productive tool to teach a remote user how to use and operate the terminal.\nIf the computer is behind a router it becomes a little more complicated. You need to instruct your user to open up ports on their router, or at the very least allow remote router configuration (this is dangerous so beware, once they open up router to the internet you should log in and make sure all IP's except your home/work ip is masked). If there are one or two computers behind the router you need to administrate you can open up an individual ssh port each (say 22 for the main PC and 8022 for the second one). With >3 computers this becomes a nightmare to manage so the easies sollution is to do a \"dual-ssh\", you ssh into one computer on the intranet that has port 22 forwarded to it and then from that computer you ssh into all the local PC's as you wish. For large networks you can set up a VPN which will behave very similarly (in essence your computer will \"seem\" to be on the remote intranet, you can connect to all the computers as though they are on your own LAN).\nIf there is a corporate/school/national firewall in the way you need to instruct the user to contact the person in charge of the network to see how you can get a port forwarded to their PC.\n", "Q: Is there a Sticky Note application?

I'm not too worried if there's a slight delay between the audio coming in and it being played out through the speakers.\nAs far as I'm aware this is refereed to as software loopback.

Obvious this isn't ideal as I don't really want it recording what I'm playing all the time.\nI know this is possible because of the Audacity example however I'd like to know if there's a way to do it without it recording. I've search around for a while for a piece of software that does this, however I couldn't get anything even close.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Just a warning: This answer is theoretical, because i don't own such hardware...\nAFAIK you have to enable a loopback-device for pulseaudio:\npactl load-module module-loopback\n\nAfter that you should see a new application under audio-settings.\nIf it works well, you may add a line to the pulse-audio-config to make this persistent:\nsudo sh -c ' echo \"load-module module-loopback\" >>  /etc/pulse/default.pa '\n\nGood luck!\nAdditional info from matto1990:\n\nYou only need to do this if you want to loopback from a device other than the microphone or line in (the default ones).

I have done the following and want to understand what is going on with my graphics driver\n\n\n*\n\n*Resized windows 7 and did fresh install of 10.10\n\n*Booted into 10.10 and things seemed to be working okay\n\n*Enabled ATI graphics, and was clearly working on the ATI rather than Intel GPU (desktop cube worked)\n\n*Rebooted, got an error that modprobe could not load modules.dep, and also something about i915 symbols\n\n*Rebooted into recovery mode, modified xorg.conf to remove the mention of fglrx\n\n*Rebooted, and the errors show, but then x starts but clearly in intel graphics\n\n\nI would ideally like to be able to switch between the ATI and Intel graphics, a la vga_switcheroo. My first problem seems to be that the folder\n/sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo\n\ndoes not exist, hinting at some kind of kernel issue. What can I do to get this available?\nThanks!\n\nA: I think that I found the solution, we are on the same page, please look this comment:\n\nFound the problem. As mentioned in\n  other sites, vga_switcheroo will\n  magically disappear if you have the\n  proprietary Radeon driver installed.\n  This driver is called fglrx. So if\n  Synaptic shows that you have fglrx on\n  your machine, uninstall it and reboot\n  - et voila, vga_switcheroo returns.\n\nThis might help!\ncheers!\n\nA: You have to use the open source graphics drivers see http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Features . I have managed to switch between the cards on my laptop using the switchroo patch with the open source dirvers. It simply will not work with the AMD ATI proprietary fglrx drivers. However, the 5650 performance was really poor - I am starting to think it used the VESA drivers – interested to see if you could get it to work. \nI am attempting to squeeze as much out of the integrated ATI 4200 as possible at the moment. \n\nA: I was having the same problem that I couldn't see the vgaswitcharoo directory, but, it came back once I removed the ATI proprietary drivers and reboot.\n\nA: First of all: This does not work with the closed source fglrx driver.\nIt works with i915 and radeon.\nSince the radeon driver often crashes for me with modeset=1, i got it working with radeon.modeset=0..\n\nA: I got it working in my laptop with Ubuntu Control Center.\n\nA: You can activate vga_switcheroo by adding modeset=1 to the kernel boot parameters.\nBesides that I couldn't get my 5650M to work with the ATI proprietary driver either. You can put the graphics to \"discrete\" in the BIOS, then it may work, without switchable graphics though...\n\nA: I figured it out; for me it was the kernel config, see the Gentoo WiKi for more info:\nhttp://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Vga_switcheroo\nAs for Ubuntu 10.10 I think you'd just have to wait for the Ubuntu team to patch it or recompile the kernel yourself, which really isn't all that difficult these days with tools like apt-src and make-kpkg as they do most of the hard work for you.\n\nA: your modeset should be 1:\nadd into /etc/defaults/grub either i915.modeset=1\nor radeon.modeset=1.\n", "Q: Use two networks at the same time? I want to use Ubuntu 10.10 Server in a classroom, a computer lab whose bandwidth is provided by a local cable ISP. That's no problem, though the school network has an IP printer that I want to use. I cannot reach the printer through the cable Internet. But, I have two network cards.\nHow is it possible to use both networks at once?\neth0 (static 192.168.1.254) is plugged into a four-port router, 192.168.1.1. On the public side of the four-port router is  Internet provided by the cable company. I also have the classroom workstations plugged into a switch. The switch is plugged into the four-port router. The whole classroom is wired into the cable Internet.\nThe other NIC, eth1, could it be plugged into an Ethernet jack in the wall? It uses the school network, and I might receive by DHCP an IP address like 10.140.10.100, with the printer on maybe 10.120.50.10.\nI was thinking about installing the printer on the server so that it could be shared with the workstations. But how does this work? Can I just plug eth1 into the school network and access both LANs?\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.254\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet dhcp\n\n\nA: I did a quick test setup here at home, with a 10.0.1.0 network and a 192.168.43.0 network (the first my usual LAN over Ethernet the second my phone over wireless.) I have no problem pinging to either network, so I would expect the computer to be able to find printers on both networks since it automatically takes the correct network interface.\nI'm 99% confident you will have no problem at all (don't sue me in case of the other 1%).\n\n\nA: I'm assuming you don't have any routes set locally on the Ubuntu box. \nIf your target IP address shares address space with the directly connected interface, it should by default route to the correct IP. \nYou will be able to see what networks your interfaces 'own' with ip route show.\nFor example, \n$ ip route show\n192.168.2.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.2.22  metric 1 \n\nIn this case, a 192.168.1.x/24 address (eth0) would be the gateway for the the same 192.168.1.x/24.  A 10.x.x.x address will be the gateway for all 10.x.x.x that fall under its subnet mask. \nThis is actually what you see in bacon's answer.  It shows a ping test where the gateway and target IP addresses are in the same network -- the network masks match exactly.  192.168.43.102 is within the same /24 network (as indicated by the 255.255.255.0 network mask) as the interface.\nThe only problem would be confusion over other subnets -- the interface connecting to the outbound ISP path would need to be the 'gateway of last resort' for all routes that aren't directly connected. \nYou can get this to work, but you should do a quick test to make sure you can reach the resources you need.\nYou might find that you need to use route add to add a default route.  \n\nA: Just to complete the other answers: in case your PC is unable to connect to your device, you can “force” the network device to use a particular address and/or subnet by adding a route, without messing with default routes.\nHere are my routes before adding a specific route for one of my devices on Wi-Fi:\n# Note: ro is a shorthand for route.\n$ ip -4 ro\ndefault via 192.168.0.254 dev eth0  proto static \n192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.20  metric 1 \n192.168.0.0/24 dev wlan0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.15  metric 9\n\nNotice that they both use the same subnet and that pinging 192.168.0.17 (the device on the Wi-Fi network only) fails (not sure if that's normal).\nUsing sudo ip -4 ro add 192.168.0.17 dev wlan0, I added a route specifying that wlan0 should be used for 192.168.0.17.\nI am now able to connect to that host using the wlan0 interface, while everything else still goes through eth0 (which is much faster!). Deleting the newly added route is as simple as replacing add by del.\nIt seems that it is also possible to manage routes from the graphical network manager, although using the command line is much faster.\n\nA: I believe the issue you may be having here is that a large institutional network like a school may well use multiple subnets. By default, the second network interface will only become the preferred route for the subnet assigned to you by DHCP.\nYou should check what the subnet mask being assigned to your eth1 interface by DHCP is by using the following command:\nip addr show dev eth1\n\nTo check if the printer belongs to the same subnet you are being assigned by DHCP you can use the following online checker:\nhttps://tehnoblog.org/ip-tools/ip-address-in-cidr-range/\nSimply enter the IP address of your school's printer in the first box and the IP address including the /number part from the above command into the second box.\nIf this tool says that the printer IP address is not in the CIDR range then this is the problem you are having and you will need to manually add a static route via the eth1 interface.\nTo do this you can figure out the gateway you need to use on the school network by checking the default route the DHCP server is assigning you with the following command.\nip route show dev eth1\n\nThen to add a route to the printer you can use the following command:\nip route add [printerip] via [schoolgateway] dev eth1\n\nYou can save yourself doing this every time as /etc/network/interfaces allow you to configure commands to be run when the network interface is brought up using the up option followed by the command to run. This option may be included multiple times if you need to run more than one command eg if you need to add more than one route. Here is an example with one command:\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet dhcp\nup ip route add [printerip] via [schoolgateway] dev eth1\n\nNote this will only add a route for the printer and if you need to access other internal services on the school network you may need a broader route or several routes. If this is the case I would suggest checking with your school's IT department as they should be able to inform you what addresses ranges should be routable on the school network and which gateway to use for each address range. You can then add these using as many of the following commands as you need:\nip route add {NETWORK/MASK} via {GATEWAYIP} dev eth1\n\nAgain make this automatic by adding them to the end of your /etc/network/interfaces configuration for eth1 in the following form:\nup ip route add {NETWORK/MASK} via {GATEWAYIP} dev eth1\n\n", "Q: Beep in shell script not working? I'd like to use a beep sound in a shell script. Unfortunately none of the methods I found via Google work for me.\nI tried\necho -e '\\a'\n\necho -ne '\\007'\n\nand the command beep after I installed it via apt.\nWhat could be the reason?\n\nA: \"Beep can only work if your PC has a traditional old style \"speaker\", and probably most if not all laptops and small devices don't have one.  \nHowever what they often have instead is a sound chip and one or more speaker(s) that can be used to make any sound you want.\nSo the outdated advise to install the beep command and/or the kernel module pcspkr will silently never work when you don't have the old style speaker hardware.\nINSTEAD:  Try playing a sound like this when you want a beep:\npaplay /usr/share/sounds/sound-icons/capital\n\nNote this uses the paplay (Pulse Audio Play) command which mixes better with other user level (user app) sounds on your system, and not the older aplay (ALSA Play) command which generally can only play one sound at the same time.  But note however, that PulseAudio calls ALSA to actually play the sound.  \nMy previous suggestion to use play might still work, but running SoX of which play is from, is overkill.\n\nWorks for me when all else failed.  Thanks to: tredegar & hk_centos and others.\n\nA: I finally found a solution, which doesn't require alsamixer to have a PC Beep option. I think I remember all my changes:\nuncomment the following in /etc/pulse/default.pa:\nload-sample-lazy x11-bell /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/bell.ogg\nload-module module-x11-bell sample=bell-windowing-system\n\nper this bug, run pactl upload-sample /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/bell.ogg bell.ogg\n\nA: Since this is a very high rated question on google, I'll add the steps I did to re-enable beep in both console and X11:\n\nFor the Linux Console (CTRL+ALT+F1...F6):\nWhy it does not work by default\nAs already answered, the pcspkr kernel driver for the PC Speaker is blacklisted in Ubuntu. \nTemporarily enable until reboot:\nsudo modprobe pcspkr\n\nAutomatically enable on boot:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n(delete or comment pcspkr line by prepending it with #)\n\nFor X11 terminals (such as the default gnome-terminal)\nWhy it does not work by default\nUnder X, like when using Unity, KDE, Gnome Shell, the beep events are captured by PulseAudio thanks to module-x11-bell, which is loaded by default at /usr/bin/start-pulseaudio-x11. And the sound sample PulseAudio plays on beep, bell.ogg, is blank by default. Additionally, the bell volume may be muted.\nTo temporarily enable for current session,\nxset b 100  # perhaps not needed, on my system it was 40 by default\npactl upload-sample /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/bell.ogg bell.ogg\n\nThere are other suitable samples you can try at /usr/share/sounds, for example check the ones at /usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts/\nNote that the beep program is not really necessary. But if installed, it uses the PC Speaker. It was the only way I could find to enable the buzzer under X:\nsudo apt-get install beep\n\nTo automatically enable on boot, just add the above lines in your ~/.profile, or system-wide at /etc/profile\n\nTo test it:\nprintf '\\a'\n\nBeep!\nbeep\n\nBuzz!\n\nA: I've encountered this problem before. From what I remember, the problem is that the terminal bell tries to ring an internal computer speaker (as in an old-school desktop) but laptops and some newer computers are missing such a thing.\nThe only solution I found at the time was to\nsudo apt-get install sox\n\nand\nplay -n synth <duration in seconds> sine <freq in Hz> vol <volume (0-1)>\n\ne.g.\n play -n synth 0.1 sine 880 vol 0.5\n\n\nA: To fix this problem persistently:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run gconf-editor and if the desktop | gnome | peripherals | keyboard | bell_mode setting is present then change it from off to on\n\n*Run dconf-editor and if the org | gnome | settings-daemon | peripherals | keyboard | bell-mode setting is present then change it from off to on\n\n*Add pactl upload-sample /usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts/glass.ogg bell.ogg to the file ~/.xprofile (you need gnome-control-center-data for glass.ogg)\n\n*Add [ \"$DISPLAY\" ] && xset b 100 to the file ~/.bashrc\nThe simplest way to activate this solution is to reboot.\nFurther, to implement this solution immediately for a terminal window that is already open, run the pactl command and run the xset command in the terminal window in question.\n\nA: As far as I can tell, this is a bug: System beep broken in Karmic despite heroic efforts to fix it.\n\nA: If you have actual speakers connected to the computer and you're not getting a beep it's likely because you are using compiz. Compiz is relying on pulseaudio catching the beeps and playing them while metacity bypasses the usual setup and uses libcanberra to play a beep sound. If it works with metacity and not compiz that is your problem, otherwise the answer htorque gave is corrent.\n\nA: An alternative approach - set your xterm / console to \"Visual Bell\" so that when it would beep, the window simply inverts its colours for a short time.\nI have a bash function called beep to get my attention once a command is finished.\nbeep ()  { while true; do  echo -en '\\a'; sleep 1; done }\n\nAnd it is used this way\nlongrun-command ; beep\n\n\nA: It might be to late BUT, for the guy in the future looking for this:\nprintf '\\x07'\n\n\nA: I added this little function to my .bashrc as a replacement for beep:\nbeep () {\n    if [ \"$1\" = --list ]\n    then\n        find /usr/share/sounds -type f -exec basename {} \\; | sort -n | tr '\\n' ' '; echo\n    else\n        paplay $(find /usr/share/sounds -type f -iname \"${1:-bell}*\" | head -1)\n    fi\n}\n\nIt searches for a file in /usr/share/sounds starting with supplied argument or \"bell\" and plays it. beep --list returns list of files in /usr/share/sounds.\n# Examples\nbeep\nbeep bark\nbeep trump\n\n\nA: Not being a fan of the pcspkr beep, I use a beep from one of the system sounds with the installed pulseaudio server's paplay command.\nFirst find a sound you like (you can browse /usr/share/sounds for some available ones for example) and create a reference to it \nexport BEEP=/usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/ringtones/Harmonics.ogg\n\nThen have it available as a command\nalias beep='paplay $BEEP'\n\nNow just run beep whenever you need it. For example, to alert you when a command is finished:\nfind . | grep treasure ; beep\n\n\nA: First run sudo modprobe pcspkr and then beep should work.\nThe reason this doesn't is because by default Ubuntu no longer loads the hardware driver that produce beeps.\nIf this works for you then to enable the loading of pcspkr permanently edit the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file (using gksudo gedit perhaps) and comment out line that says blacklist pcspkr so it looks like this:\n# ugly and loud noise, getting on everyone's nerves; this should be done by a\n# nice pulseaudio bing (Ubuntu: #77010)\n# blacklist pcspkr\n\nA: paplay /usr/share/sounds/purple/alert.wav\n\n\nA: Today, June 2020, in Ubuntu 18.04, the whole sudo modprobe pcspkr and commenting out of the blacklist pcspkr part of the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file, as described here, doesn't seem to be necessary.\nMine is still blacklisted, yet my bell character sound works just fine!\n$cat /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf \n.\n.\n.\n# ugly and loud noise, getting on everyone's nerves; this should be done by a\n# nice pulseaudio bing (Ubuntu: #77010)\nblacklist pcspkr\n\nInstead, just make sure the Terminal bell sound is turned ON in your gnome-terminal settings:\nRight-click on the screen in gnome-terminal --> Preferences --> check the box for \"Terminal bell\" under the \"Sound\" section, as shown below:\n\nNow run this, and hear the dull \"thud\" sound of the bell character sound:\necho -e \"\\a\"\n\nThis also works over remote ssh sessions, which is super handy when building on a remote machine, for instance, so that it will play the bell sound when the build is done, to alert you:\ntime bazel build //...; echo -e \"\\a\"\n\nAlso note that pressing Backspace when there's nothing to delete will also play this sound in gnome-terminal.\nRelated:\n\n*\n\n*`terminator` terminal won't play bell sound\n\n*Update: Also see @jvriesem's response to my question in the comments under this question here: How do I enable the terminal bell?. I seem to be answering a slightly different question.\n\n\nA: Some motherboards don't have a beep speaker. To get around this, I created a Python script that instead uses FFmpeg's aevalsrc filter to generate beep noises.\nNote: you will need to install FFmpeg using sudo apt install ffmpeg\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n# This program runs FFPlay to generate beeps.\n\nfrom argparse import ArgumentParser, ArgumentError, Action\nimport re\nimport subprocess\n\n# Custom action for note\nclass NoteToFrequencyAction(Action):\n    _note = re.compile(r\"([A-G])(bb|[bx#])?(\\d+)\")\n    _note_factors = {\n        \"C\": lambda x: x / (2 ** (9/12)),\n        \"D\": lambda x: x / (2 ** (7/12)),\n        \"E\": lambda x: x / (2 ** (5/12)),\n        \"F\": lambda x: x / (2 ** (4/12)),\n        \"G\": lambda x: x / (2 ** (2/12)),\n        \"A\": lambda x: x,\n        \"B\": lambda x: x * (2 ** (2/12)),\n    }\n    _accidental_factors = {\n        \"x\" : lambda x: x * (2 ** (2/12)),\n        \"#\" : lambda x: x * (2 ** (1/12)),\n        None: lambda x: x,\n        \"b\" : lambda x: x / (2 ** (1/12)),\n        \"bb\": lambda x: x / (2 ** (2/12))\n    }\n    def __call__(self, parser, namespace, values, option_string) -> None:\n        if not (isinstance(values, str)):\n            raise ArgumentError(\"Should not have multiple values\")\n        \n        parse = self._note.fullmatch(values);\n        parts = parse.groups()\n\n        freq = 440.0\n        freq *= 2 ** (int(parts[2]) - 4)\n        freq = self._note_factors[parts[0]](freq)\n        freq = self._accidental_factors[parts[1]](freq)\n        \n        if not type(namespace.__dict__[self.dest]) == list:\n            namespace.__dict__[self.dest] = []\n        namespace.__dict__[self.dest].append(freq)\n\n\n        \n\nparser = ArgumentParser()\n\nfreq_group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True)\nfreq_group.add_argument(\"-f\", \"--frequency\", type=float, action=\"append\", dest=\"freqs\",\n    help=\"Can be specified more than once, specifies frequencies in Hz of the beeped notes\"\n)\nfreq_group.add_argument(\"-n\", \"--note\", action=NoteToFrequencyAction, dest=\"freqs\",\n    help=\"Can be specified more than once, specifies notes (e.g. A4).

The terminal bell was not working by default.\nMy solution is similar to the answer by @jdthood: I was able to fix it by toggling /org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences/audible-bell to true using dconf-editor.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use two different shells for different terminal windows? Is it possible to use another shell for scripts than for standard terminal use?\nThe problem is, i use fish as shell at the moment and i find i very convenient.\nBut i would like to learn a bit of shell programming in Ubuntu. Since there are differences between those two it would be nice, to work with fish and bash at the same time, perhaps in different terminal windows? i know i can write a shell script and have to put the interpreter in the beginning. But for testing developing at commandline i would find it useful to fast switch between shells or use two different terminal windows with different shells in one session at the same time?\n\nA: Yes, like takkat said you can start gnome-terminal, or xterm, or konsole in kde or press Ctrl+Alt+F1 or Ctrl+Alt+F2 or Ctrl+Alt+F3, etc.. All by default use bash but you can have fish opened along side with them as well.\nTo have any of the 2 do this:\ngnome-terminal -e bash (To start gnome-terminal with bash)\ngnome-terminal -e fish (To start gnome-terminal with fish)\n\nA: You can switch to any installed shell by running it at the command line.   This applies to bash, ksh, ash, dash, fish, csh, etc.  These will inherit the login environment from the original shell.  \nStarting an interactive session as a login session will use the shell from your login.  You need to change your shell between starting sessions if you want different login sessions. \nFor your purposes, I would just open an a second window and replacing the shell with the command exec /bin/bash -i. \n\nA: You can easily start two terminal windows by typing\ngnome-terminal\n\nin your fish shell.\nIn case you changed your standard shell to 'fish' proceed as CYREX suggested.\n", "Q: How to show gnome-terminal menubar? I accidentally unchecked View -> Show Menubar which hides the menubar for gnome-terminal,  and there doesn't appear to be a keyboard shortcut to show the menubar again.\n\nHow can I make gnome-terminal show the menubar again?\n\nA: You can also make it via terminal command line:\ngnome-terminal  --show-menubar\n\nIf you read the man gnome-terminal you can find this:\n\n  --show-menubar\n                 Turn  on  the menu bar for the last-specified window; applies\n                 to only one window; can be specified once for each window you\n                 create from the command line.\n\n\nA: To add to Jorge Castro's answer (I can't comment on answers yet), holding shift while right clicking gives you (or me at least) that same context menu when running tmux or vi.\n\nA: Right click anywhere inside the terminal, and you'll get a similar pop up menu that lets you reenable it.\n\n\nIf you're running an application like vi you won't get this menu.  In that case exit or suspend the application first, then it should work.  (I.e. ^Z (control-Z) to suspend, then right click to get this menu, and select Show MenuBar, then finally enter % and ↵ Enter to resume.)\n", "Q: Command to open a URL Is there a command I can use in Bash that will open a specific URL in the default browser?\n\nA: There's a command that knows about your default browser:\nxdg-open http://google.com\n\nThis will also work for every other type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), like images - which will automatically open with eog, openoffice documents, and so on, and also on filesystem paths (xdg-open /tmp/foobar.png).\nThere is also\nxdg-email team@stackexchange.com\n\nand\nxdg-mime query default text/html\n\nTo find out what application is going to be used.\nYou can set your preffered application by going to System → Preferences → Preferred Applications:\n\nThese utilities are part of the freedesktop.org specification, so you can use them in your applications - and it's going to work on all of the desktops that adhere to the spec.\n\nA: If you don't necessarily want to use the default browser, you can call any browser program directly and give the URL as argument, for example:\nchromium-browser https://youtube.com\n\nor \nfirefox https://youtube.com\n\n\nA: gnome-open works as well as xdg-open but neither knows what to do with naked domain.\nSo gnome-open http://askubuntu.com works but not gnome-open askubuntu.com.\nHere is a small function to make it easier to type and accept the stripped down domain name.\nfunction go { gnome-open http://$1 ; }\n\nPaste the above in your command line, hit enter and try it out.

For my iphone I was using this with pdanet to tether via usb. Now I have an android phone, also with pdanet. I'd appreciate any help.\nEdit\nMy phone is a droid x. I'm using the latest OS officially available for that phone.\n\nA: Install easytether from Android Market. It has Ubuntu 10.04+ package you can install and it works fine.\nIt also comes with detailed instructions what to do to make your tethering work. It does not require rooted phone.\n\nA: If you are like me and did not know what Tethering is the simple definition is to use a cell phone to share the internet connection to a laptop, computer or another device. Definition: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering\nThis is if you are like me (Did not know there was a word for sharing connection from a mobile phone to another device. I thought it was just sharing connection hehe)\nAnyway here are several methods (Simple ones, there are other tough ones):\nProxoid - It is Free. Does not require root permission and has little configuration\nThe Proxoid Android app can tether your phone for free since it turns your Android device into a proxy server that your computer uses to make internet requests. Proxoid is free in the Android market, but to get it working you have to install the Android SDK or device drivers onto your computer, tweak some of the settings, and then configure your browser to use a proxy server\nThe pros of this method are that it's free and you don't need to gain root, so it's less risky. The cons are that you've got to install the Android SDK (something really only developers should have to do), and set your browser to use the proxy server each time you want to tether.\nProxoid - http://code.google.com/p/proxoid/\nProxoid Doc - http://code.google.com/p/proxoid/wiki/installationLinux\n\nPDAnet - Costs about 30$. Does not require root access and needs minimal configuration\nPDAnet Android application lets you tether Android using an app on the phone plus simple software you install on your computer.\nPDAnet costs $30 if you want to access https ports (which the free version blocks). To connect to the internet via the phone, you tap a button to start PDAnet on the phone, and click \"Connect\" in the PDAnet on your computer.\nThe pros of PDAnet are that it's risk-free, easy to use, and requires minimal setup. (You do have to enable USB debugging on your phone, which is the geekiest step it involves, but that's just a checkbox in your phone's settings.) The cons of PDAnet is that it requires the PDAnet software on your computer and that it costs $30.\nPDAnet - http://www.junefabrics.com/android/index.php\nPDAnet Doc - http://www.junefabrics.com/android/faq.php\n", "Q: Opening DocX Files I am doing some marking that requires me to open .docx file created using Microsoft Office 2007+. OpenOffice doesn't seem to be doing a good job for it, so far, hid all the images in the documents. Any idea if there is a program that is guaranteed to open .docx file correctly? Please pay attention to the word \"guaranteed\", because otherwise I might not be fair to the students.\n\nA: Google Docs sometimes does a better job with .docx files than Open Office does-- but definitely no guarantees.\nWhat should work -- though I wouldn't stake too much on this -- is to get a Windows Live account with Microsoft, upload the .docx file to your Microsoft \"skydrive\", and use the \"Edit in Browser\" option (which surprisingly sometimes works even on Linux). Since you're using Microsoft's own software, everything should be OK. I often get something to the effect that the document contains things that only work in standard Word, however, and then it won't let you open it. (Microsoft trying to get money out of you, of course.)\n\nA: The only program that is guaranteed to open docx files correctly is Microsoft Office >= 2007. You could potentially try to run this in wine.\nYou could require students to hand the work in using a decent file format, such as .odt, or at least the older .doc format, which OpenOffice handles well. This would make life easier for everyone.\n\nA: Try LibreOffice 4.1, it loads .docx more compatible than previous version (4.0), mine is version 4.1.0.4, I've tried it to open a .docx file and compared it to LO v4.0.\nKingsoft office (free proprietary program, available on .deb and .rpm) seems opens .docx more accurately than LO 4.1 and loads .pptx even better. I've tried this program to open a .docx files and compared it to LO 4.1, but I don't study it further to open other .docx files, but I think it will open other .docx better, you can try it.\nI also had have tried IBM Symphony maybe approximately 3 year ago, I abandoned it and sticked to OpenOffice.org (OOo) (at that time LibreOffice is not present yet), then I try again latest Symphony maybe 1 year ago just for review, I think there are improvements, but sticked again to LibreOffice (at that time I've change from OOo to LO) but I think I will prefer the Kingsoft and LO 4.1, LO 4.1 feel faster and stable now.\n\nA: Web\nGoogle Docs\nLinux\nLibreOffice\n\nINSTALL LibreOffice\nRepository\n sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:libreoffice/ppa\n\n.\nsudo apt-get update\n\n.\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice libreoffice-style-breeze\n\n\nA: You might try with another proprietary program. For instance, IBM Lotus Symphony is available for Ubuntu and is able to open .docx files. Perhaps it will give a better display than OpenOffice?\nIt permits you not to create a Google or Windows Live account. Nonetheless you have to give an email address to IBM, but normally they won't bother you at any time.\n", "Q: Installation doesn't start, kernel thread helper message and blinking keyboard LEDs I finally got my old computer to boot from a cd, then it loads the cd and i can't get to the installation.

The only thing moving on the screen is a blinking underscore (_) at the bottom of it. \n\nA: The blinking lights indicate a kernel panic where the kernel has basically been booted from the cpu. It's very, very bad. Normally it's caused by faulty hardware, but sometimes it can be caused by bad acpi support or some very bad bug in Linux.\nIn order to figure out what the issue is, we'd need to see what kind of message appears on the screen.

For strange reasons best not asked, I have a projector plugged into my computer that is pointed at a mirror. So the computer image is displayed on a wall, but it is mirrored.\nIn Linux(ubuntu) I can go to display preferences and set the external monitor to have a rotated image. Is there a clever way I could have it set to rotate/flip the image?\n\nA: After testing on 2 PCs, I found the following:\nOn some integrated cards like Intel you can use xrandr in console. For example:\nGo to console (Ctrl+Alt+T)\n\n*\n\n*xrandr -x will flip de video horizontally like a mirror.\n\n*xrandr -y will flip de video vertically.\n\n*xrandr -y -x will flip both.\n\n*xrandr -o normal will return to normal the video.\n\n*xrandr -o inverted will...invert O.o\n\nBut if you have an Nvidia this may not work. For an Nvidia to work you need to:\n\n*\n\n*Edit you xorg.conf: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n\n*Find the section that has Driver \"nvidia\" in it\n\n\n*Copy and paste the following at the end of that section: Option    \"RandRRotation\" \"on\"\nThis will activate the rotation for Nvidia which comes off by default. Why off by default i do not know.\nAfter that reboot and you can change the orientation BUT NOT the reflection. What i mean with this is that Nvidia does not yet support reflection options like -x or -y options in xrandr.

I lost some custom settings, but not all.  \n(For the curious: the hangup was caused by rsync writing 600 GB to OS-1's 320 GB drive..

It worked!   \nWhy can I not change the grub menu from OS-1? \n.. or if it can be done, How?\n\nA: The problem is that you currently have two Ubuntu installations, each with their own grub.cfg, but only one grub installation. When you boot your computer, grub loads and reads the grub.cfg from OS #2. To make it so that grub reads from OS #1's grub.cfg you need to install grub from within OS #1. In addition you want to make sure that OS #2 is not configured to install grub on upgrades, or else it will overwrite OS #1's grub again.\nThese instructions assume that you only have one hard drive, /dev/sda: \nFirst boot OS #1 and run sudo grub-install /dev/sda (note that this should not be a partition like /dev/sda1). Then boot OS #2 and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc, this will ask a few questions. For the first and second question leave the option at its default value (the first will likely be blank, this is normal). For the third question, \"GRUB install Devices\", make sure that no install devices are selected (you can toggle whether a device is selected with the space bar, and move between devices with the arrow keys). You will be asked to confirm that you really want to continue without installing grub, select yes.\n", "Q: How to set the monitor to its native resolution which is not listed in the resolutions list? After installing Ubuntu 10.04 with my Samsung SyncMaster B2030, native resolution (1600X900) is not found in the list of resolutions.\n\nA: First type in xrandr in your terminal and see which is the connected device. It maybe VGA1 as it is in this case. If not then replace VGA1 by your connected device in the commands below. Then create a new document and name it eg:- \"yourname.sh\" Type in: \nxrandr --newmode \"1600x900_60.00\"  118.25  1600 1696 1856 2112  900 903 908 934 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1600x900_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1600x900_60.00\nunity --replace\n\nand save it in your home folder (this is for resolution 1600x900). Make it executable by:\nchmod a+x ~/yourname.sh\n\nopen startup applications and click \"ADD\". Give a name and type in the command line\nbash /home/yourname/yourname.sh\n\nclick save. The change appears after you log out and log in\n\nA: \nNative resolution for Samsung SyncMaster B2030 is 1600 * 600 60 Hz\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate the modeline using cvt:\ncvt 1600 900 60\n\nwhich will be:\n# 1600x900 59.95 Hz (CVT 1.44M9) hsync: 55.99 kHz; pclk: 118.25 MHz\nModeline \"1600x900_60.00\"  118.25  1600 1696 1856 2112  900 903 908 934 -hsync +vsync\n\n\n*Get the name of the output to which your display is connected:\nxrandr\n\nThis outputs among other things: \nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1600 x 900, maximum 8192 x 8192\nVGA1 connected 1600x900+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm\n\nIn this example the name of the output is VGA1.\n\n*Create the new modeline (with the values from the output of cvt):\nxrandr --newmode \"1600x900_60.00\"  118.25  1600 1696 1856 2112  900 903 908 934 -hsync +vsync\n\nNote: \n\n\n*\n\n*the above should be in a single line\n\n*make note of  x in 1600 x 900_60.00\n\n\n*Add the above created modeline:\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1600x900_60.00\n\n\n*If everything went well xrandr will list your newly added resolution.\n\n*Test the newly added resolution:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1600x900_60.00\n\nThe resolution you set with the above commands will not persist across sessions. Until Ubuntu 11.04 you can add the following lines at the beginning of your /etc/gdm/Init/Default to set the resolution automatically every time you log in:\nxrandr --newmode \"1600x900_60.00\"  118.25  1600 1696 1856 2112  900 903 908 934 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1600x900_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1600x900_60.00\n\nThis question describes other ways to make xrandr customizations permanent.\n\nA: If you don't want to go through the bother of running all the commands as instructed in other answers, you can use ResolutionX. This is a tool that does it all for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*executes the cvt command\n\n*executes the newmode, addmode and output commands\n\n*creates a startup file that executes the above upon login.\n\n", "Q: How can I get the Unity interface to work on my netbook? I have 10.10 installed on my netbook, but the Unity interface that came with it does not seem to work. The top and side bar are missing and several graphical menus don't work. I have tried updating my graphics card but have had no luck. Any suggestions?\n\nA: If you can't get unity to work on your netbook, try to install package \"ubuntu-desktop\" (sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop) and login to Ubuntu Desktop instead of Ubuntu Netbook. But If you really want a unity interface you have to wait for Ubuntu 11.04 to be released, because Unity in Ubuntu 10.10 use mutter which doesn't support a lot of graphic cards.\n\nA: You can also select a different interface, at the login time. If your netbook automatically logs you in, simply log out from the main menu. Once on the login window, select a different interface from one of the buttons on the bottom. That's how I got back to the classic display using the ubuntu Netbook remix instead of the new interface. My main reason for this change, in my case, was a very sluggish display performance, where every click took about 5 seconds before seeing any actual feedback on the display. I know there was a fix for it, somewher, but I did not like the interface anyway. \n\nA: thanks for the help.  I was able to switch it to the desktop interface. I figured there would be some initial issues with how old my laptop is, but other than the unity interface not working it seems to run pretty well.\n", "Q: How can I change the \"timeout\" duration for Nautilus \"find the filename as you type\" feature? I often get stalled by the long timeout while typing the first few letters of a file name in Nautilus...  \nThe current timeout seems to be 5 seconds. I'd prefer 1 second ...(as per item 2 on this page about Response Times)\nI don't use the mouse much, which means I either wait, or press Escape, when I don't find the file...  \nI realize that this is a feature to some, but I'd rather not wait.\nIs there any way to change this timeout behaviour?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the five second delay is hard-coded into Nautilus. Here's how to hack it:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, set up your build environment:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nsudo apt-get install devscripts\nsudo apt-get build-dep nautilus\n\ndevscripts might ask you to configure Postfix, select anything you want (\"No configuration\" should be fine, if you don't use Postscript, it shouldn't ask otherwise)\n\n*Get the source code of Nautilus:\napt-get source nautilus\n\n(Notice no sudo here)\n\n*Now to change Nautilus. Open nautilus-2.32.0/libnautilus-private/nautilus-icon-container.c in your favourite text editor. The line we're concerned with is about line 149. It should say:\n#define NAUTILUS_ICON_CONTAINER_SEARCH_DIALOG_TIMEOUT 5\n\nReplace the 5 with any amount of time you like. This must be an integer, and ≥ 1. I've change it to one second, as the article recommends. ;-)\n\n*Now to build the package:\ncd nautilus-2.32.0/\nsudo debuild\n\nThis will take a while. It should, at least. If it finishes with an error like \"patch does not remove cleanly\", run sudo debuild -nc instead). Note also that this may complain about it not being able to sign the package. You don't need a signed package in this case, they're only required if you want to upload them somewhere.\n\n*You should now have some .deb packages in the parent directory. Install them all:\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nAfterwards, restart your computer (logging out may be sufficient, I'm not sure), and test the changes. As you know, your changes will be undone with every update of Nautilus. \n", "Q: Error with missing Wallpaper after remove unity from sudo command After I paste these scripts into terminal, my wallpaper became white.\nsudo ln -s /etc/xdg/xdg-une/autostart/maximus-autostart.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/\nsudo ln -s /etc/xdg/xdg-une/autostart/netbook-launcher.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/gconf/une/default/20_une-gconf-default /usr/share/gconf/defaults/\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/gconf/une/mandatory/20_une-gconf-mandatory /usr/share/gconf/defaults/\nsudo update-gconf-defaults\n\nHelp me, I dont know what [-s] for ? and how do i get my wallpaper back.\nBest Regards from Newbie\n\nA: It's so funny that i solved my own question.

If yes how exactly should i go about with it?\nThanking you in anticipation.\n\nA: If you think you may have hardware issues with your HDD, you should check it's SMART status. Boot your computer with an Ubuntu LiveCD and check your drive status through Disk Utility (System -> Administration menu).\nSee this answer for a more detailed explanation.\n", "Q: Will \"apt-get upgrade\" also upgrade my PHP version? Will sudo apt-get upgrade also upgrade PHP from 5.2 to 5.3 on my Ubuntu 9.04?\n\nA: An upgrade will only install security updates. So the short answer is no.\nThe full answer is, that for 9.04 updates are no longer provided as it has reached the end of its life cycle last October. You should seriously consider updating to a newer release (using sudo do-release-upgrade). Using 10.04 (which is an LTS release) you will get php 5.3.\n\nA: Ubuntu 9.04 is now out of the update loop, so you're stuck with whatever you've got currently unless you update it manually.\nTo check the current version, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check in Synaptic.\n\n*Make a new PHP page containing: <?php phpinfo() ?>, which tells you all about your current PHP configuration.\n\n*Install the apt-show-versions package, and then run $ apt-show-versions php5.\n\n\nIf you don't have it and want to upgrade Jaunty (9.04) to PHP 5.3, I found a guide.\nAs a bit of background: The Ubuntu package update philosophy is usually to avoid major updates to packages; you'll receive only security patches, bugfixes and minor release updates. I'm not really familiar with the decision-making process, but I assume that PHP5 releases, being following the 5.x.y pattern, would remain on the 'x' that came with the distribution release. The 'y' would be updated, though.\nEdit: Hit submit early, added more info.\n\nA: If you want actual version of PHP (now it's 5.4), you should add ppa repository or build packages yourself.\n5.4 is not for production now(wait until 5.4.1 or 5.4.2), it's for development.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install php5\nphp5 -v\n\n", "Q: Alt+F2 (Run Application) doesn't work for custom commands In order to speed up Android development, I've edited my ~/.bashrc to add some paths to PATH:\nexport PATH=${PATH}:/opt/android-sdk/tools:/opt/android-sdk/platform-tools\n\nThis works just fine from the command line (I can just type android and, no matter where I am, the Android SDK and AVD Manager will start up just fine.\nHowever, if I try to type android in the Alt+F2 dialog (Run Application), it gives the following error:\n\nCould not open location 'file:///home/felix/android'\nError stating file '/home/felix/android': No such file or directory\n\nWhy is that? What PATH does the Run Application dialog use?\n\nA: ~/.bashrc is included by ~/.profile by default. The ~/bin directory is added to PATH by default too. Create the ~/bin directory and add sym-links (ln -s) to applications you intent to use, or modify your ~/.bashrc.\nThe default content of the mentioned files can be found in /etc/skel -- used while creating new account and their home directories.\n\nA: I assume the bashrc is not read by Gnome, and why should it, since it is a config file for bash.\nI define my path in ~/.profile. This file is definitely read by the Gnome and XFCE environments and should by others as well. (But it is read only on login, so you have to log out and back in any the changes to take effect!)\n\nA: I had the same issue with Linux Mint (Cinnamon 2.8.8), and there was no way I could get it working with the usual fixes (using a .profile, changing Xsession shebang to /bin/sh -l).\nThe issue is that /bin/sh, which is usually a symlink to /bin/dash reads ~/.profile if it's a login shell (i.e., given the -l option).\nYou can check that with strace:\n$ strace -e open dash\nopen(\"/etc/ld.so.cache\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nopen(\"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nopen(\"/dev/tty\", O_RDWR)                = 3\n$ ^D\n+++ exited with 0 +++\n$ strace -e open dash -l\nopen(\"/etc/ld.so.cache\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nopen(\"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nopen(\"/dev/tty\", O_RDWR)                = 3\nopen(\"/etc/profile\", O_RDONLY)          = 3\n--- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=12260, si_status=0, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---\nopen(\"/etc/profile.d/Z97-byobu.sh\", O_RDONLY) = 3\nopen(\"/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh\", O_RDONLY) = 3\nopen(\"/etc/profile.d/vte.sh\", O_RDONLY) = 3\nopen(\"/home/elias/.profile\", O_RDONLY)  = 3\n$ ^D\n+++ exited with 0 +++\n\nI couldn't figure out which script to change (tried a bunch of them under /etc/X11 and /etc/mdm), but no luck.\nSo I threw the towel and changed /bin/sh to point to /bin/bash instead of /bin/dash and it's working now. :)\n", "Q: How to configure phpMyAdmin to access multiple servers? What is the Ubuntu way to configure phpMyAdmin so that I can use it to administer multiple  MySQL servers? The database parameters are set in /etc/dbconfig-common/phpmyadmin.conf, but there's only space in there for the connection parameters for a single server. I could hack it into /etc/phpmyadmin/config-db.php and /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php, but I assume there has to be a more elegant way.\n\nA: Fairly old question, but still relevant on searches.\nphpMyAdmin uses plain PHP for config files, and the $cfg['Servers'] array to get the configured servers.\nSo the proper way is to add a new config file in /etc/phpmyadmin/conf.d for every server you want to add. It's only required to end the files name in .php to get them included, but it's a good idea to use your_new_server.inc.php for consistency.\nThe minimal contents for a given config file would be:\n<?php // let the interpreter know this is code\n$cfg['Servers'][2]['host']     = 'THE_HOST';\n$cfg['Servers'][2]['user']     = 'THE_USER';\n$cfg['Servers'][2]['password'] = 'THE_PASSWORD';\n\nAs stated in another answer, you can check the /usr/share/doc/phpmyadmin/examples/config.manyhosts.inc.php file for more parameters.\nImportant: You have to increase the index (2) of the array for every new file, and avoid using 1 if you want to keep connecting to localhost.\nIf the guy(s) that package(s) phpMyAdmin had thought about it, they could have added the incrementing $i variable in the foreach that includes the files from the conf.d directory, so you could just use it as the index and not worry about having to increase it manually, but sadly it's not the case. You can do it yourself though.\n\n[2019]: Newer PHP versions allow this more succinct alternative syntax:\n<?php $cfg['Servers'][] = ['host'=>'my_host', 'user'=>'my_user', 'password'=>'my_pass'];\n\n\nA: I think this is the most accurate way to do it:\nFirst setup the password:\nsudo htpasswd -c /etc/phpmyadmin/htpasswd.setup admin\n\nThen disable security:\nsudo pma-configure\n\nThen go to http://yourserver/phpmyadmin/setup (here the browsers ask for auth, the user is admin and the password is what you write in first command), with that wizard you configure your servers, once is done, put the security again:\nsudo pma-secure\n\n\nA: I have assumed the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/phpmyadmin/ would be the most logical place to add the config\n\n*/etc/phpmyadmin/config-db.php is the location for the default (local?) config. This is, because it is a default, one db only\n\n*/etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php reads the default database so it has one. At least this one is used, so you have a database. If something changes in your config, the config-db.php is changed, so 'local' changes to your file are not modified\n\n\nTherefore my conclusion was that adding an extra server below this part:\n/* Configure according to dbconfig-common if enabled */\nif (!empty($dbname)) {\n    //reading from config-db.php\n}\n\n//$i++ was allready done in if above\n//Adding extra servers\n $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = 'serverhost.host.tld';\n $cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension'] = 'mysqli';\n//...etc\n\nThis looks like the best place.\n\nA: According to the phpMyAdmin documentation you can define multiple servers in the $cfg['Servers'] array defined in the config.inc.php file.\n\nA: The main configuration file is stored in /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php. This file includes the\n\n\n*\n\n*Blowfish secret from /var/lib/phpmyadmin/blowfish_secret.inc.php\n\n*Generated config from phpMyAdmin setup script (diegueus9's method)\n/var/lib/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php\n\n*DB values from\n/etc/phpmyadmin/config-db.php which are generated from /etc/dbconfig-common/phpmyadmin.conf by /usr/sbin/dbconfig-generate-include. /etc/dbconfig-common/phpmyadmin.conf can be modified using dpkg-reconfigure -plow phpmyadmin\n\n*Extra configuration files from /etc/phpmyadmin/conf.d/*.php\nSome example configuration snippets are in /usr/share/doc/phpmyadmin/examples including config.manyhosts.inc.php. This file can be added to /etc/phpmyadmin/conf.d. It works by resetting the i variable back to 1 before creating any hosts so that it overrides the host set in /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php.\nIf you want to do a more advanced configuration, you will probably want to change the /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php file and possibly add other configuration extensions using /etc/phpmyadmin/conf.d.\nTo add support for additional configurations to older configuration files, you can create the directory /etc/phpmyadmin/conf.d and then add the below PHP code to the bottom of /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php:\n/* Support additional configurations */\nforeach (glob('/etc/phpmyadmin/conf.d/*.php') as $filename) {\n        include($filename);\n}\n\n", "Q: How to restart nautilus without logging out?

You can pass \"model=<name>\" option to\n    specify a certain model in such a case.  There are different\n    models depending on the codec chip.  The list of available models\n    is found in HD-Audio-Models.txt\n\n    The model name \"genric\" is treated as a special case.  When this\n    model is given, the driver uses the generic codec parser without\n    \"codec-patch\".  It's sometimes good for testing and debugging.\n\n    If the default configuration doesn't work and one of the above\n    matches with your device, report it together with alsa-info.sh\n    output (with --no-upload option) to kernel bugzilla or alsa-devel\n    ML (see the section \"Links and Addresses\").\n\n    power_save and power_save_controller options are for power-saving\n    mode.  See powersave.txt for details.\n\n    Note 2: If you get click noises on output, try the module option\n        position_fix=1 or 2.  position_fix=1 will use the SD_LPIB\n        register value without FIFO size correction as the current\n        DMA pointer.  position_fix=2 will make the driver to use\n        the position buffer instead of reading SD_LPIB register.\n        (Usually SD_LPIB register is more accurate than the\n        position buffer.)\n\n    NB: If you get many \"azx_get_response timeout\" messages at\n    loading, it's likely a problem of interrupts (e.g. ACPI irq\n    routing).  Try to boot with options like \"pci=noacpi\".  Also, you\n    can try \"single_cmd=1\" module option.  This will switch the\n    communication method between HDA controller and codecs to the\n    single immediate commands instead of CORB/RIRB.  Basically, the\n    single command mode is provided only for BIOS, and you won't get\n    unsolicited events, too.  But, at least, this works independently\n    from the irq.  Remember this is a last resort, and should be\n    avoided as much as possible...\n\n    MORE NOTES ON \"azx_get_response timeout\" PROBLEMS:\n    On some hardwares, you may need to add a proper probe_mask option\n    to avoid the \"azx_get_response timeout\" problem above, instead.\n    This occurs when the access to non-existing or non-working codec slot\n    (likely a modem one) causes a stall of the communication via HD-audio\n    bus.  You can see which codec slots are probed by enabling\n    CONFIG_SND_DEBUG_VERBOSE, or simply from the file name of the codec\n    proc files.  Then limit the slots to probe by probe_mask option.\n    For example, probe_mask=1 means to probe only the first slot, and\n    probe_mask=4 means only the third slot.\n\n    The power-management is supported.\n\nPossible models for my codec:\nSTAC9227/9228/9229/927x\n=======================\n  ref        Reference board\n  ref-no-jd    Reference board without HP/Mic jack detection\n  3stack    D965 3stack\n  5stack    D965 5stack + SPDIF\n  5stack-no-fp    D965 5stack without front panel\n  dell-3stack    Dell Dimension E520\n  dell-bios    Fixes with Dell BIOS setup\n  volknob    Fixes with volume-knob widget 0x24\n  auto        BIOS setup (default)\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have much idea of putting them to use.\nUpdate:\nI tried every model listed for my codec but still couldn't get it to work.\noptions snd-hda-intel model=ref\noptions snd-hda-intel model=ref-no-jd\noptions snd-hda-intel model=3stack\noptions snd-hda-intel model=5stack\noptions snd-hda-intel model=5stack-no-fp\noptions snd-hda-intel model=dell-3stack\noptions snd-hda-intel model=dell-bios\noptions snd-hda-intel model=volknob\noptions snd-hda-intel model=auto\n\nI tried them one by one by putting it at the end of config file\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nAfter every change I force-reload alsa\nsudo alsa force-reload\n\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem with exactly the same SigmaTel STAC9227 (though my motherboard is DQ965GF).

When I open a message with an attachment and choose to \"Open\" the attachment, thunderbird downloads the attachment and saves it in /tmp and then opens it.\nFor security reasons I would like to be able to change the directory where the file is saved from /tmp to somewhere (I will use an encrypted volume). I cannot find a setting in thunderbird to do this, does anyone know if this is possible?\n\nA: I have a workaround: Thunderbird uses the standard environment variable $TMP by default to determine where to store temporary files. It also uses this folder when you select to \"Open\" a mail attachment.\nTherefore I have simply made a simple script to set this environment variable before launching thunderbird. I have modified my thunderbird shortcuts to use this script.\n#!/bin/sh\nexport TMP=/media/truecrypt1/scratch\nnohup thunderbird &\n\nI would still be interested if anyone else has a more elegant solution; perhaps one that only affects the storage location of \"Opened\" attachments.\n\nA: If you use an encrypted container, consider mounting a tmpfs over /tmp.

The problem does not seem to occur on a laptop running Windows Vista.  The problem does not seem to occur on my Openmoko Freerunner ( running Android 1.5 ), though I hardly ever use this device to connect over WLAN, so the problem may have just slipped by.  This problem does not seem to appear when I boot into Ubuntu 9.10 from a live CD ( more precisely, I was able to ping fu-berlin.de for an hour without any packet loss ).  Under Ubuntu 10.10, I am experiencing about 33% packet loss.\nOn my main Ubuntu Desktop, I have tried the following wireless devices: \n\n\n*\n\n*a Longshine PCI card ( an old device with an RTL8180L chip ) \n\n*a D-Link DWL-510 PCI card ( this device threw warnings in dmesg )\n\n*a USB device from MSI ( US54EX ).\n\n\nUsually my wireless network shows up in the network manager with a normal signal strength, even when the connection speed is slow ( which happens often ) or the connection gets reset ( asking me to click connect to re-authenticate my wireless connection ).  \nI have observed this problem with a Netgear KWGR614 Router ( with the manufacturers firmware ), as well as with a TP-LINK TL-WR741ND router running OpenWrt.\nTaking a look at my routers logs, I find many instances of the following line:\nTuesday,04 Jan 2011 03:53:01 [TCP SYN Flood][Deny access policy matched, dropping packet] \nI know that the Netgear router is susceptible to denial of service attacks, as I have previously been able to disrupt its operation by putting an nmap scan into a while loop.  I use WEP on the Netgear router and WPA on the TP-LINK to encrypt the wireless connections.\nI seemed to have been able to circumvent the problem for a while ( at least on my main machine running 10.10 ) by putting\niwconfig wlan1 power off\n\ninto my /etc/rc.local.  ( Thereby turning power management off on my wireless device .)  Further testing has shown that this reduces packet loss to about 5%.\nStrangely though, power management is on by default in 9.10 ( where the connection worked fine ), and it is already turned off on the laptop running 10.04 ( where I get a bad connection sometimes ).\nUbuntu support suggested I try the backported wireless drivers, which seems to have gotten rid of the packet loss phenomenon, but pages are still loading very slowly, including the configuration page for my wireless router.\nI have now filed a bug on launchpad:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/704777\n\nA: This may be caused if there are drivers that are available but are not activated.

When I use ffmpeg to convert an audiofile with the option \n-acodec libfaac -ab 192k \n\nand use \nffmpeg -i \n\non that file afterwards to get the audio file information, it tells me \nbitrate: 152 kb/s\n\nWhy ist this? Do I miss something here? If I want to convert a file with a bitrate of 192kb it should give me 192 kbit after the conversion, shouldn't it? \nOr: How do I get the 192 kbit rate then?\n\nA: I can't provide any further explanation, but several places (e.g. [1]) mention: \n\nNote that the maximum average bit-rate (what -ab specifies in the context of\n  libfaac) is 152 kbit/s. Setting this higher will be ignored and 152\n  kbit/s will be used.\n\n\nA: There are now much better aac encoders for Linux such as NeroAacEnc or fdkaac but if you are still keen on using faac there is a patch that means faac can encode with a bitrate of 192k, and a great deal higher as well. Handbrake formerly used this patch and hosted it on their site but the developers have dropped faac support now, I now host the patch here:\nhttp://www.andrews-corner.org/patches/A00-bitrates.patch\nPatch Faac and then compile FFmpeg with --enable-libfaac and you can have high bitrate aac files with Faac.

An askubuntu guide to rebuilding the faac debian package to allow higher bitrates.\n\n\nA: For high and low bitrates you have to specify a different cutoff frequency.\nwithout cutoff frequency this example results in a max bitrate of 166kbit/s (+ 2kbit/s muxing overhead):\nffmpeg.exe -y -i input.ts -vn -c:a libfaac -ar 48k -b:a 210k out.mp4\n\nsize=     308kB time=00:00:15.01 bitrate= 168.0kbits/s\n\nWhen I specify the cutoff frequency to half of the samplerate, I can go up to 210kbit/s\nffmpeg.exe -y -i input.ts -vn -c:a libfaac -ar 48k -b:a 210k -cutoff 24k out.mp4\n\nsize=     388kB time=00:00:15.01 bitrate= 211.7kbits/s\n\nLikewise, the default will not go below 64.5kbit/s:\nffmpeg.exe -y -i input.ts -vn -c:a libfaac -ar 48k -b:a 20k out.mp4\n\nsize=     122kB time=00:00:15.01 bitrate=  66.4kbits/s\n\nBut if I set the cutoff frequency very low, I can get 20kbit/s:\nffmpeg.exe -y -i input.ts -vn -c:a libfaac -ar 48k -b:a 20k -cutoff 1k out.mp4\n\nsize=      40kB time=00:00:15.01 bitrate=  21.9kbits/s\n\nIn these examples I used a samplerate of 48kHz. When using a lower samplerate, the bitrate will/can also be lower.\n", "Q: Is music store successful?

To have a solution for all files (as said in this answer), run: \ncd .local/share/applications/\nln -s mimeapps.list defaults.list\n\nIn case this stops working: see that the undesired application is not again selected under about:preferences: be sure \"Always ask\" is selected there. Setting manually a different program (even the default for your file-type at system level, but which is not marked as \"default\" in the list for your file under about:preferences) might not work.\nTested in Firefox 60.0 in Kubuntu 18.04.\n\nSomething is not right with the Firefox settings. \"Always ask\" and \"Save file\" do not make sense for files already downloaded, therefore settings under about:preferences shouldn't affect the Downloads list. But they do. And they do in an inconsistent manner: only selecting the application marked as default is followed, switching to another application is not. To reverse that one might need to select \"Always ask\" and then follow the steps mentioned above.\n\nA: UPDATE: Ever since Firefox 18, Firefox has GIO support instead of GnomeVFS support, so the workaround below shouldn't be necessary anymore. If anyone's still hitting this issue in recent Firefox versions, this will be unlikely to fix it.\nSo, take the rest of this post with a grain of salt...\nThe fix\nThis fixes it for me:\ncd .local/share/applications/\nln -s mimeapps.list defaults.list\n\nand finally, restart Firefox.  When it comes up again, its Download Manager should invoke the correct program (as specified in the .list files referenced above).\nDetails\nFirefox (up through trunk nightlies as of this post) currently uses GnomeVFS API to ask \"What app should I use to open files with this mimetype?\"  However, GnomeVFS has become deprecated in favor of GIO.\nNautilus (I'm looking at ver 2.32.2.1) now uses GIO to register user-specified default handler-applications (like smplayer in your case).  GIO and GnomeVFS use different files to manage their settings, but the files are apparently in the same format (at least similar enough for the above \"ln\" hack to work for me. :))\n(I've investigated this in a bit more detail on a Mozilla bug report.)\n\nA: To follow up to Peterling's solution, that worked for me. I was messing around with my mime types files forever trying to figure it out. Turns out that installing Nautilus on my Mint17 KDE system was the way to go. It strikes me as ridiculously convoluted that Firefox is looking at Nautilus settings on a system that does not even have it, but there you go. I'm running Firefox 33 BTW.\n\nA: The Applications tab in Firefox preferences controls how to play embedded or linked content, not downloaded files. To change the application that opens a specific mime type via download manager, close Firefox then delete the mimeTypes.rdf file from your profile, then open Firefox again and double click the file in the download manager. It will prompt for the application to be used. Choose /usr/bin/smplayer, then tick the option to remember your choice.\n\nA: I know this question is now more than one year old but I had now the same problem with Firefox and found the solution after a long fight with a lot of editing and changing.\nAnd I am so happy about it that I want to share it :) \nThe solution (im my case) is quite simple:\nAll files that are downloaded with firefox and opened with a click in the download window seemed to be opend by ??? cuz it was not handled with the firefox settings and not with mimeTypes.rdf ... .

As more recent posts state that the solutions here do not work I am posting this askubuntu answer as a solution tested in 2022 with Kubuntu.\nThe idea is to make the changes for given file-type in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list.\n\nA: There is nothing to do with firefox.Because the file is already downloaded. if you want to open downloaded .wmv and .avi files with smplayer you can do it like this. right click on any .wmv file and select 'Open With' --> 'Other Application...' and select your favorite application(In this case smplayer) from the list and check the 'Remember this application for \"WMV video\" files' check box. do the same for .avi files also.\n\nOr if you want to open files from firefox's save dialog box with your desired application just follow this article: http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Managing%20file%20types\nHope this helps\n", "Q: gzip is not working after the pipeline For some reason gzip doesn't work.

Because you're sending the output from the mysqldump command to database.sql, there's no output left to be piped through to gzip. Just remove that bit, so you're only creating the gzipped file: /usr/bin/mysqldump --opt -u root -ppassword database | gzip > database.sql.gz\nIf you really want to create compressed and uncompressed versions, you'll either need to run two separate commands: /usr/bin/mysqldump --opt -u root -ppassword database > database.sql ; cat database.sql | gzip > database.sql.gz\nor use tee to split the output: /usr/bin/mysqldump --opt -u root -ppassword database | tee database.sql | gzip > database.sql.gz\n\nA: Try this\n/usr/bin/mysqldump --opt -u root -ppassword database | gzip > database.sql.gz\n\n\nA: pipeline means that you are NOT writing to file, so just remove \" > database.sql\" in your one-liner.\nTry something like this instead:\n/usr/bin/mysqldump --opt -u root -ppassword database | gzip > database.sql.gz\n\nA: Because there is no more ouput after the creation of the sql file database.sql. It does not continue so the pipe does not receive any data. you could do this: mysqldump -u root -p auth > data.sql && gzip data.sql\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to redirect the output both to a file and to a pipe.\nIf you want to compress the output of the command to a file you must use:\n/usr/bin/mysqldump --opt -u root -ppassword database | gzip > database.sql.gz\n\n", "Q: Add binding to fish that not auto executes the string?

I often see tutorials on the web or posts on this site which make heavy use of the following characters at the command line. Often it seems that they are used for pretty similar purposes. What are the differences between them when used on the command line or for shell programming? For what purpose do I use which of them?\n\" \" double quotes\n\n' ' single quotes\n\n` ` backticks\n\n\nA: Single quotes ('') are used to preserve the literal value of each character enclosed within the quotes.\nUsing double quotes (\"\"), the literal value of all characters enclosed is preserved, except for the dollar sign ($), the backticks (backward single quotes, ``) and the backslash (\\).\nWhen enclosed inside back-ticks (``), the shell interprets something to mean \"the output of the command inside the back-ticks.\" This is referred to as \"command substitution\", as the output of the command is substituted for the command itself.\nreferences: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/bash_guide_for_beginners/sect_03_03.html\n\n*http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=MContent&pageid=20\n\nA: For the sake of example, consider that variable foo contains uname (foo=uname).\n\n\n*\n\n*echo \"$foo\" outputs uname, substituting variables in text.  \n\n\n*\n\n*For a literal $ character inside \" quotes, use \\$; for a literal \", use \\\".\n\n\n*echo '$foo' outputs $foo, the exact string.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Even ' can't be escaped as \\' inside ' quotes. But you can use 'foo'\\''bar'.\n\n\n*echo `$foo` outputs Linux, executing the content of the variable and echo printing it.\n\n\nA: echo '$HOME' is \"$HOME\"\n\nSingle quotes prevent the variable expansion, while double quotes allow it.\n\nA: Am just talking in general but:\n\"\" - Used to process some info inside of them before output. (Like in PHP.) \n\n\n*\n\n*For example: name=NESS; echo \"Hello my name is $name\" will output: Hello my name is NESS\n'' - Used to show the output as it is. (Also like in PHP.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the example above, it will output Hello my name is $name\nSo the difference between double and single quotes is that double quotes process the variable and show the value, while single quotes show the name of the variable without processing.\n`` - Used to quote commands that are later assigned to another variable.\n\nA: This is explained very nicely in the relevant section of the bash manual. Briefly, anything within single quotes is interpreted literally. So, for example:\n$ echo '$SHELL'\n$SHELL\n$ echo '{1..3}'\n{1..3}\n\nCompare that to the unquoted versions:\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\n$ echo {1..3}\n1 2 3\n\nDouble quotes allow variable expansion (also history expansion and some other things). Basically, you use them when you are dealing with something that you want to see expanded. For example:\n$ echo \"$SHELL\"\n/bin/bash\n$ echo \"!!\"\necho \"echo \"$SHELL\"\"\necho /bin/bash\n\nIn other words, single quotes completely protect a string from the shell while double quotes protect some things (spaces for example) but allow variables and special characters to be expanded/interpreted correctly.\n\nA: Single quotes enclose a value which is to be taken literally: all types of expansion are suppressed.  Usually used if the value includes or may include white space (space, tab, new-line), or special characters ($, \\ , ` ) that the user does not want to be expanded/treated specially by the shell.  \nDouble quotes enclose a value which will have variables, and character replacement done.  Required when the output may contain whitespace, and must be assigned as a single value. \nBack quotes enclose a command, the results of which are wanted as value.  Newer shells allow the use of $(...) in place of `...`.  I prefer the newer method.\nThe following code may help understand what is happening.\nCMD='ls .'\necho sq: $CMD\nset $CMD\necho raw 1: $1\necho raw: $*\nset \"$CMD\"\necho dq: $1\necho bq: `$CMD`\necho new: $($CMD)\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu Desktop 32Bit Support more than 4GB Memory with default installation? Does Ubuntu Desktop 32 Bit support more than 4GB memory WITHOUT changing anything (Without having to activate PAE via compiling kernel or anything similar). Will installing the 32 Bit Ubuntu on the machine be enough to detect the additional memory automatically. If yes, will this work if I add more than 4GB with a 32Bit Ubuntu already with 4GB Ram.\nOne example would be to have 8GB Ram with Ubuntu 32 Desktop.\nMy Motherboard supports up to 8GB RAM and it has 32 Bit and 64 Bit support (It is the intel DP35DP)\n\nA: From the Ubuntu Community Documentation: Enabling PAE\n\nBoth the CD and DVD installer of Ubuntu 10.04 automatically installs the PAE enabled kernel if it detects more than 3 Gb of available memory.

I merely wanted the memory to work now and PAE was not installed on my 11.04.

Are there any differences between insmod and modprobe?\n\nA: modprobe is an intelligent command, it looks for dependencies while loading a module. Suppose, if I loaded a module, which has symbols defined in some other module (this module path is given inside the main module). So, modprobe loads the main module and the dependent module.\nBut if insmod is used, it won't load the dependency, and hence it will give compilation errors like Unresolved symbols. In this case, we have to manually look for dependent module and need to load them in order to resolve the errors.\n\nA: modprobe reads the modules from /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.dep.bin (or without the .bin suffix if the other file is not available). From the same file, dependencies are loaded.\nmodprobe accepts the name of a .ko file in /lib/modules/$(uname -r) (e.g. nvidia-current for the file dkms/nvidia-current.ko) and aliases (modules.alias.bin). Builtins (modules.alias.bin) are recognized as well, but since these modules are loaded by default, there is not point in modprobing this kind of modules.\ninsmod on the other hand accepts paths to files. The module does not have to reside in /lib/modules/$(uname -r), but dependencies are not automatically loaded. This is the lower program used by modprobe to load modules.\nOther programs related to modules are rmmod and modinfo.\nrmmod removes a kernel name based on the name from /proc/modules. This name does not necessarily have to be the same as the one passed to modprobe (for the nvidia-current file, this is nvidia for example).\nmodinfo accepts a filename, or the filename without .ko suffix in /lib/modules/$(uname -r).\n\nA: Per man insmod:\n\nMost users  will  want  to use modprobe instead, which is more clever and can handle module dependencies.\n\n\nA: The modprobe utility is worth a quick mention. modprobe, like insmod, loads a mod- ule into the kernel. It differs in that it will look at the module to be loaded to see whether it references any symbols that are not currently defined in the kernel. If any such references are found, modprobe looks for other modules in the current module search path that define the relevant symbols. When modprobe finds those modules (which are needed by the module being loaded), it loads them into the kernel as well. If you use insmod in this situation instead, the command fails with an “unresolved symbols” message left in the system logfile\n\nA: The modprobe command offers more features than the more basic insmod and rmmod utilities. modprobe intelligently adds or removes a module from the Linux kernel. Note that for convenience, there is no difference between _ and - in module names (automatic underscore conversion is performed). modprobe looks in the module directory /lib/modules/uname -r for all the modules and other files, except for the optional configuration files in the /etc/modprobe.d directory (some distributions use the /etc/modprobe.conf file instead).\nknow more\n\nA: As described above insmod takes an explicit path of the \"mymodule\".ko files, while modprobe \"mymodule\" search in the  /lib/modules/'uname -r' path for the module name and does not process explicit file names.\nI wanted to use modprobe and it did not find the .ko file in the path. Even if insmod can load it.\nIt turned out that I had to refresh the dependencies of modules with\nsudo depmod\n\nso that modprobe actually finds the modules that you newly place in the /lib/modules/'uname -r' path\n", "Q: How to collect all the \"txt\" and \"log\" files using find?

I would like to modify it to include also all the \".txt\" files but I don't know how, this should be fairly simple right? \n\nA: This is almost the same as Raphael B.'s answer, but one that will also handle exceeding the maximum argument length. We do this by simply telling tar to read the filenames to archive from stdin (where there is no limit) instead of expecting them as arguments:\nfind . \\( -iname \"*.log\" -o -iname \"*.txt\" \\) -print0 | tar --null --files-from=- -zcf \"$file\"\n\nNote that this is GNU specific. tar on other UNIX or UNIX-like systems does not understand --null, but the tar in Ubuntu is GNU tar, so it'll work fine there.\n\nA: You are on the right way.

Is there any advantage to using Evolution over webmail? (Newbie GNU/Linux user!)\n\nA: The main advantage of using any mail client over webmail is that your e-mail is local to the computer you're using.  So...\nAdvantages of local storage :\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't have to be connected to the internet in order to read your e-mail offline.  Some webmail clients offer this through add-ons, however, such as Google Gears for Gmail.\n\n*Assuming you use your own ISP's\ne-mail, then you'll gain some privacy\nfrom keeping your e-mail local.\n\n*You can run encryption tools like PGP\nto create digitally signed and/or\nencrypted e-mail.  I'm not aware of\nany webmail that allows this (might\nbe ignorant of them though).\n\n*You can easily backup/move your\ne-mail to other computers, or keep it\non a central server and access it\nprivately from multiple local PCs.\n\n*Attachments, since they're local,\nwill load/run very quickly.\nDisadvantages of local storage:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're responsible for your own backups.\n\n*Your data is usually local to a single PC (unless you set up a NAS/Server solution)\n\n*Re-installing your PC will mean reconfiguring your client (unless you save then restore your /home data).\n\nA: you can use gmail in evolution too:\n\n\n*\n\n*as IMAP\n\n*as POP3 - you will have a copy of your emails offline as a backup, you are getting notifications for new mails, you also can access emails via browser online from everywhere. You get the best of two worlds\n\n\nA: What I find most advantageous about using Evolution is that you can connect to several webmail accounts and calendars simultaneously and see them all in the same window.  This way you don't have to keep clicking back and forth between web pages to view your different calendars and email accounts.\n\nA: As so many have stated, it is a choice of local mail storage or cloud storage.  But as also stated, that is not a clean decision since you can leave email on a server, and still use evolution to download the mail locally.  That actually makes evolution a local backup of your mail while keeping copies on the server.\nI use Evolution and own a domain, I use that domain as my \"never to change\" address so that argument does not apply.  Also, evolution has the contacts/calendar/filtering and more functionality which competes with many other cloud and local applications.  You can have evolution pick up email from many different accounts so you have all email in one mail tool.  Many of the other cloud mail solutions can pull from different sources too so is also a weak argument, but one to consider.\nBut one really important thing, you have no idea of backups in the cloud.  There are no guarantees.  Yes they do a good job, but there is no commitment.  Most savvy companies using the cloud realize they have a business continuity issue if they just trust the cloud to backup data.  You should take a backup of your own, evolution can do that.\nAlso, if you download in evolution then you are moving your data out of the cloud.  If you value privacy then that may be a deciding factor.  If you do not care that your email is out there and vulnerabilities get exploited and your private emails made public, then this does not matter.\n\nA: For personal use, I have not used any email client for a few years. Once in awhile, I have tried to install different email clients and am always reminded why I have been 100% using Webmails (gmail, yahoo, ymail, hotmail).\nHere are why I am 100% using webmail:\n\n\n*\n\n*As I like to experiment with different things on Ubuntu, there are many times when I totally crashed my system, that I have to reinstall everything from square one. By using solely on Webmail, I don't have to worry about Scaine's #1 and #3 disadvantage items. \n\n*Mobility: Webmails allow me to check my emails from anywhere without having being restricted to my own laptop. I can check the emails from my cellphone, work laptop, etc.\n\n*Consistency: I have owned the email accounts (gmail, yahoo, hotmail) for almost 10 years. I have not had the need to update anyone everytime I change my ISP and as the result changing the ISP based email addresses.\n\n*Cloud Computing: this seems to be something of a buzz word lately. We are at the point now where the technology allows us to manage part of our life online, i.e. email, schedules, etc. My family lives all over the world and the way we connect is through online tools, i.e. facebook to share photos, emails for correspondence.\n\n", "Q: Problem installing eclipse-platform I am trying to install the eclipse-platform package in a new Ubuntu 10.10 and I am getting the following error (via the Ubuntu software center):\nFailed to fetch http://nz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/libs/libservlet2.4-java/libservlet2.4-java_5.0.30-12_all.deb\n404  Not Found\n\nBrowsing to the mentioned URL, I can obviously verify that the .deb file in question is missing.\nIs the package broken, or is it just the NZ mirror?\n\nA: A nice discussion between Raphael B. and Stefano Palazzo as to which method is recommended. However, neither says by whom. I, however, will give my recommendation, with no intention of being the generally correct answer for everybody.\nI have always installed my own private version of Eclipse for a number of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It’s ridiculously simple.\n\n*The packaged version will always lag behind a bit, and I want the cutting edge. I also have to align with other people in my shop.\n\n*It allows me to have several Eclipse installations side-by-side, each with a different set of plugins, since it often is a bad idea to include every plugin under the sun (oh, an unintended pun) into one Eclipse.\n\n\nA: It's just the mirror. The German mirror is fine: http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/libs/libservlet2.4-java/libservlet2.4-java_5.0.30-12_all.deb\nBut, it's not recommended to use the packaged version. Continue reading and download Eclipse and unzip it in your preferred directory -- it's really simple by this howto.\n\nA: It's probably just the mirror, as I have it installed (and up to date) on my machine.

One thing that I noticed with the Apple BlueTooth keyboard is that it will never properly bind to your adapter until it is given some \"name\". This is something done, for example, when auto-detected on a MAC computer. I had this issue under Ubuntu 9.10, back then, and a friend of mine just tested the device on his Mac. At that time, the device was given the name of his computer, automatically. From then on, the keyboard never had any problem connecting to my Linux box. I just asked him to rename my keyboard to something else than his own name, of course. The only issue I had, and this is normal is that if I bind my keyboard, say, to my desktop, it will be unbound from my laptop.

When booting the problem was that the synaptics was not working i then made the changes describe in EDIT 2. Now when i press the disable button in the synaptics touchpad it disables the mouse AND the keyboard. After enabled the Keyboard keys and Mouse clicks do not work. If i click on the panel below, for example the Applications, Places or System buttons the focus gets stuck there forever. I can open nautilus by clicking on it but i can not use the menus, the ALT+F2 function, see the wireless connections, lower the sound through the panel, etc..\nHere comes the weird part. If i press CTRL+ALT+F1 (or any other tty for that matter) and then come back to CTRL+ALT+F7 where the gui is everything works perfect again. This started about a week ago but she told me right now. i checked dmesg which is for sometime now throwing some warnings about Skipping EDID probe do to cached edid but for what i could find out this did not create the problem in the start.\nNOTE: I do not need to login when i do CTRL+ALT+F1 i just need to change to another tty then come back to F7.\nWhat could be causing this problem?\nEDIT 1 - After a couple of tests, this is what happens or is added to /var/log/syslog when i change to CTRL+ALT+F1 after the problem starts:\nJan  4 22:33:07 mary acpid: client 1234[0:0] has disconnected\nJan  4 22:33:07 mary acpid: client connected from 1234[0:0]\nJan  4 22:33:07 mary acpid: 1 client rule loaded\nEDIT 2 - I have solved the synaptics when booting up (the problem was that it was not working at all) by adding this to rc.local:\nrmmod psmouse\nmodprobe psmouse proto=imps\nEDIT 3 - Found two articles about the same problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1470117 - / - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-input-synaptics/+bug/549727/+index?comments=all\nEDIT 4 - After some more tests i found maybe the problem (Not 100% sure). When i click on the disable button in the synaptics touchpad it makes a change in the file:\n.gconf/desktop/gnome/peripherals/touchpad/%gconf.xml\n and it makes FALSE the following line:\n<entry name=\"touchpad_enabled\" mtime=\"1294200522\" type=\"bool\" value=\"false\"/>\nBut when i enable it again it does not change the file. It leaves it FALSE that is why i have to do CTRL+ALT+F1 to activate it somehow.\nEDIT 5 - I made a file called touchpad.conf in /etc/modprobe.d with the following line: options psmouse proto=imps To test. It still did not work.\nUPDATE: The following HP Models are affected by this problem on Ubuntu 10.10:\n\n\n*\n\n*HP DV6000\n\n*HP DV6500\n\n*HP DV9000\n\n*HP DV9200\n\n\nA: THIS MIGHT WORK FOR OTHER LAPTOP MODELS\nI have to pad my back on this one. The following will solve this problem to anyone at least with a HP dv6000 or dv6500 laptop. Do the following in the terminal:\nThis is divided into three parts:\nNOTE: Before starting MAKE SURE YOU UPGRADE ALL PACKAGES!\nSTEP 1 - Solve the mouse not functioning when starting the PC problem\nDoing this even if your mouse in the dv6000 or any other variation works correctly will not create any other problems.\nType: sudo nano /etc/rc.local\nand add above the EXIT 0 the following lines:\nrmmod psmouse\nmodprobe psmouse proto=imps\n\nSave an continue with STEP 2.\nSTEP 2 - Making sure that when you turn OFF and ON the touchpad it stays ON!\nGo to the terminal and type:\nsudo gconftool --type bool --set /desktop/gnome/peripherals/touchpad/touchpad_enabled true\n\nThis will activate the synaptics and make it work (It will make the value true for gnome-settings-daemon) UNTIL next reboot when the problem will appear again. To solve this, do the following step:\nsudo gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings/touchpad \"\"\n\nThis in essence will disable any chance for gnome-settings-daemon to change the boolean value.\nI can confirm this works on the HP dv6000 and dv6500.

I use Ctrl-P very frequently to scroll backward in the command history, but I often mistype it as Mod4-P, which is bound to the switch display function. \nI've searched around Keyboard shortcuts and CompizConfig, etc., but I couldn't find where Mod4-P is bound. What controls that?\n\nA: Disregard my other answer, it's incorrect.\nThere are laptops out there that have a physical button for video output switching hardcoded to send Win+p.  This is why Ubuntu now interpets Win+p as a video output switching key.\nThis is hardcoded in gnome-settings-daemon and can be disabled in gconf by setting\n/apps/gnome_settings_daemon/plugins/xrandr/active\n\nto false.  This workaround probably has a nasty side effect of breaking your real video switch key, if you have one.\nP.S. This feature is added via an Ubuntu-specific debian/45_support_new_video_key.patch, but upstream gnome-settings daemon will do the same thing in a different gnome-settings-daemon plugin (media-keys).  It is therefore likely that this gconf workaround will stop working in Natty.\nP.P.S. There's an open bug claiming that stealing Win+p this way is not nice for people who have sane hardware and want to use it for something else.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 simply:\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/active false\nAt the command line :)\n\nA: Install compizconfig-settings-manager, run it, press Advanced Search >, enable the checkbox for searching in setting values, and do a search for <Super>p (and <Mod4>p, just in case -- both spellings appear to work).\nOn my machine I find that <Super>p is bound by two disabled plugins: ADD Helper and Shelf.\n\nA: For newer versions of Ubuntu, dconf is used (instead of gconf) for changing the gnome-settings-daemon setting:  see this question.\n\nA: \nOn Ubuntu Quantal\nFind all bindings to Super-p\ngconftool-2 -R /apps | grep \"<Super>p\"\ngconftool-2 -R /system | grep \"<Super>p\"\n\nUnbind them\ngconftool-2 -s /apps/compiz-1/plugins/shelf/screen0/options/triggerscreen_key \"\" --type String\ngconftool-2 -s /apps/compiz-1/plugins/addhelper/screen0/options/toggle_key \"\" --type String\n\n", "Q: Automatically suspend if no one is logged in for 30 minutes For a number of stationary machines here at the university, I would like to have a setup where the machines suspend themselves to save power 30 minutes after the last user logged out.

I had to explicitly tell it to suspend instead of just power save.\n\nA: What you need to do is set up your power management preferences for the gdm user. To do this from the command line use this command to make the preferences window show up when you log out or switch user:\nsudo cp /usr/share/applications/gnome-power-preferences.desktop /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow/\nNow log out, restart or switch user and you should get the power management preferences window. (I did, I just tested this)\n\nOnce you've set up your preferences how you like them, log back in and remove the auto start desktop file:\nsudo rm /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow/gnome-power-preferences.desktop\nSeeing as your managing a lab, you will want to know how to duplicate these settings for all the comptuers on your network without busting a sweat all day. Simply sync the /var/lib/gdm/.gconf directory to your other computers (I have automated scripts to do this on my network, you might too)\nYou can run this trick with a bunch of different configuration apps, look at what's auto starting, in the directory above, to see what kind of services are available. It is possible to change the theme and wallpaper this way too, but you can use gdm2setup, a third party app to do some of that.\n", "Q: How do I subscribe to a bug?

However I discovered that a configuration file was left behind in my home folder.\nIs there a more powerful command which would remove even that? \nAlso, is it safe to delete the hidden files and folders under home, if they are merely configuration files, or are there other kinds of files?\n\nA: apt-get purge only removes system-level configuration files (e.g. those created by debconf). It doesn't touch anything in your home folder -- you have to remove those manually. That makes sense if you think about it: there might be multiple users, who probably wouldn't want administrators deleting data out of their home folders!\nApplications usually store configuration data in one of the following hidden folders, which you can delete if you're sure you have no use for the data:\n\n*\n\n*~/.application\n\n*~/.config/application\n\n*~/.cache/application\n\n*~/.local/share/application\nReplacing application with the name of the app or package. Most applications don't store user files in those folders, and if you accidentally delete something out of your home folder that the system needs, it usually just gets re-created. Of course, it doesn't hurt to look inside before you delete them, just to make sure there's nothing you want in there.\nFor gnome 2 apps you might also want to run:\ngconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/application\n\n(again replacing application with the app name) which will get rid of your application preferences.\nUpdate 12-14-2012\nFor gnome 3 apps, the gconftool-2 command above is replaced by:\ngsettings reset-recursively [schema]\n\nYou can find the schema for the application with\ngsettings list-schemas | grep application\n\n\nA: I don't know the automatic way, but you can remove manually the hidden configuration directory from your home directory.\nusually the directory name is .appname in your home directory, for example, mozilla firefox has configuration folder with name .mozilla.\nto show the hidden directory from nautilus, you can press CTRL + H \n", "Q: How do I boot to a windows recovery partition from GRUB on a Toshiba computer? This should be simple but I cannot figure out how to do it. I've been dual booting Ubuntu and Vista for a while. About 8 months ago, I realized my windows partition got corrupted and wouldn't boot. This wasn't a problem since I didn't need it anyway, but now I do need windows. \nUsing the disk manager I can see a partition called Toshiba System Volume which is 1.6 GB and one called HDD Recovery which is 7.8 GB. I assume the second one is what I need and I'm not sure what the first one is for. Anyway, how do I boot to this one? Is it a matter of configuring GRUB to boot to it? Once I do boot to it will it let me only reformat my windows partition, or is it going to restore the entire hard drive to factory condition? I assume I'll get the general windows installer which lets me choose the partition but, as you can probably tell, I've never used a recover partition.\nShould I burn the contents of the partition to a disk and boot to that? Sorry if this is obvious but I'm confused and cannot figure this out.\n\nA: Recovery partitions usually work differently for each computer manufacturer. For Toshiba it looks like you must start your windows installation, and press F8 before windows starts loading, then select Repair you computer. If your windows partition is too damaged you might be unable to do this. Here is a quick how-to\nIf it works you are not going to get the normal windows installer, but some kind of custom installation, probably based on images. The outcome I'd expect is that it'll wipe all of your hard disk.  Judging by the screenshots on the Toshiba page, I'd bet that it will delete your Ubuntu install.\nYour best bet is to get a normal windows installation disk. As long as it's the same version and edition (e.g., XP Professional) as the one shipped with your computer it should work. Remember to put the serial number that is on a sticker on your computer, not the one from the disk. And even this is going to hose your Ubuntu install, as it will overwrite grub. You will need to boot from a live-CD/live-USB and restore it.\nAnd remember to make a copy of your data before trying anything like this.\nThe windows serial number sticker is something like this:\n\n\nA: Did you get any error when you tried to boot into Windows? Try command sudo update-grub to update grub and try to boot in windows again. And don't forget to type here if you got any error while botting in Windows(e.g. missing file: blah.dll).\n", "Q: How to disable expand animation on appearance of cairo dock? i have set visibility of main dock to hide, so whenever i move the move to bottom of screen, dock appears with expand animation.\nhow to make dock just appear with any animation like docky or awn?\n\nA: You can easily configure Cairo Dock by right click on the dock and choosing 'Configure'.\nFrom this tutorial you can learn what setting are available. The dock can have several modes of appearance listed under the settings for \"Visibility\". There you can e.g. choose a static or a panel mode or define how the dock interacts with opened windows. You best try out the several modes to see what meets your needs.\nFrom the icon settings for Animations and Effects a zoom factor of 1.00 also stops sideway expanding animation of the dock.\n\nA: In Cairo 2.2.1, \n\nSettings -> Visibility of the main dock -> Effect used to hide the dock to Fade out\n\n", "Q: Transfer an image file of more than 5GB I am trying to upload an image file of about 5-6 GB. I therefore bought more space on my cloud but when trying to upload the file it does not work. Why? have tried with Safari and Firefox, same result, uploading appears but no data transfer. Thank you. Frederic\n\nA: Check with ubuntuone support to see if you are exceeding the maximum file size limit, I believe the maximum file size for sync is 5GB for the basic account if this is the same for files that can be uploaded with your paid account, this could be the problem.\nWhenever you use a browser to upload files to ubuntuone the file upload dialogue may not have any progress report, the upload button text just changes to uploading.\nyour file is large, depending on your bandwidth you may have to wait a long time before you can tell if the file has uploaded, try with a small file to see quickly if things are working.\nYou can try the chromium browser from the repositories, and notice the status bar, lower left corner, there is a percent upload report there.\nThe next thing to consider is that you can place the file in your ubuntuone folder or just place it in a folder you created and then sync (This assumes Ubuntu 10.04 or 10.1) that folder with ubuntuone. If it turns out that your file is too large for syncing you will have to find a way to reduce its size or do a split.\n\nA: I would think you can't upload a 5gb file via the web browser. There are plenty of limitations on the browsers and server side that would make this impossible.\nThe only way to upload such a huge file would be using the desktop client, which has built-in support for dealing with large files.\n", "Q: Ubuntu install problem: \"USB disconnect address 2\" I am installing ubuntu 10.10 and i am having problem in \"Who are you?\" section.

It would work on the disk for a while, then nothing, then work a little again. I killed the machine and started the installation all over, and this time the installation went quickly without long pauses.\nIf you don't have anything to lose (and don't have other operating systems or boot partitions on that disk), then I'd recommend that you just power the machine off and on again, and start over. The installation is so quick (when it works) that it doesn't really pay off to wait too long when it seems to hang.\nIf the installer won't complete next time either, then perhaps there's something else wrong.\n\nA: To get passed that long wait, you need to have everything in lower case. Yeah, its weird. even if you don't want a password, you still need one, also weird.\n", "Q: Why does my system show blank screen during startup?

This should work until Natty gets multiarch (which it may not), then I'll have to do a proper fork.\nUPDATE: as of now the Wine PPA for Natty works just fine.  I will discontinue it when Natty becomes unsupported, and possibly earlier if there's another compelling reason.\n\nA: It looks like there is no ppa for wine for Ubuntu Natty yet. Did you try to purge ubuntu-wine ppa and then try to add it again(wine ppa for maverick)? what about wine version in official Ubuntu repository?\n\nA: Yes, it seems to be there (there is \"natty\" dir in http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu).\nBut I still use Maverick Wine 1.3 PPA (because there was no for Natty when I've started using it) with Natty (Xubuntu 11.04) and everything works at least as fine as default 1.2 does.\nJust add\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu natty main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu natty main\nor\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu maverick main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu maverick main\nto your /etc/apt/sources.list.\n", "Q: Will wine get intergration into Unity Dash? And if so, how? Will Natty's Unity Dash have wine integration like the ubuntu-desktop session? It would be nice if it had it's own category for Wine (if installed).\n\nA: The answer, bluntly, is \"No, unless Mark gives me a job.\"\nI've had designs for better integrating Wine with Ubuntu for some time, however progress has been slow as it's an awful lot of time and most of my day is spent doing \"real work\" and the day to day tasks of package maintenance.  You can see some of this such as integrating Wine into Software Center (might not be finished by Natty), or the better Wine integration specs.\nIt would be neat to use things like the Unity Places API to make Wine really slick, but at the moment I barely have enough time to make sure things aren't horribly broken.\n", "Q: USB Microscopes I'm interested in getting a USB microscope for my kids. So, to get to the point, does anyone know what microscopes are available that work with Ubuntu? Ideally, they should be available in the UK.\n\nA: Without going through and listing X number of Microscopes I can tell you that most USB microscopes are simply cameras attached to lenses. Checking through the Hardware Support section of the Ubuntu Wiki also yields no mention of Microscope support.\nThat said your best option is to find 3-5 different models you think are good for your uses (and for your children) then search for that specific model (or just brand) with either the word \"Linux\" or \"Ubuntu\" at the end. Doing so will give you some feedback as to it's compatibility.\n\nA: I've seen positive things about the Veho USB microscope under Linux. It appears to behave like any other UVC-video-compliant device in that it should \"just work\" these days. It should present as a video input device so you should be able to use it anywhere you'd use a webcam (Cheese, Flash online, etc).\nAnd they're only about £30 so not a disaster if I'm wrong ;)\nI suggest you find a model and then stick it in Google with \"Linux\" on the end to see if other users have had luck.\nEdit: It seems like Veho and a dozen other companies just stamp their brand on this fairly generic hardware. For example, here's one by DigiMicro on DealExtreme for $30 including worldwide delivery. Note that this comes from the depths of China so a) it'll take a few weeks to get delivered and b) it won't be worth sending it back if it fails under warranty... But it's slightly cheaper.\n\nA: No sure how many work but there is Celestron-44302-Handheld-Digital-Microscope on amazon:\n\nHERE is one good user review.\nAlso there is a Intel Play QX3 that has supporting projects for Linux. See HERE for more info.\ngood luck!\n\nA: Camorama works for me, similar but different device from China though. You can install it with the command as follows.\nsudo apt-get install camorama\n\n\nA: The ProScope HR and ProScope HR2 USB Microscopes both have a Linux driver (the UVC) http://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc/\nI've personally tested the HR2 with Ubuntu and it works great.

I need to order a new server for hosting a PostgreSQL 8.4 database, however I have to choose between Ubuntu 9 or 10: which one would be better / any special caveat with one or the other?\n\nA: If you are referring to 9.10 and 10.04 releases, choose the 10.04 as it is LTS, the LTS release is recommended for production systems.\nWatch out for the file system used with PostgreSQL, there has been some regression in the performance of PostgreSQL using the ext4 file system in the past, so check if this is still the case.\n\nA: Better to go with 10 as it will have updated packages and support life span will be higher than 9. \n\nA: You should choose Ubuntu 10.04 since it's a LTS (Long Time Support) release, which means it a really stable distro shipped with only stable software. Adding that you have support until 2015-04 for the server (that include security patches, and so on). \nIt comes with postgresql 8.4.6.

It's a system which monitors your drive and Ubuntu is able to read certain values and thresholds, so it can warn you of imminent hard-drive failure. \nYou can view SMART data in Ubuntu here:\nSystem > Administration > Disk Utility > (select your hard-drive)\n\nValues which exceed the expected threshold will be shown in red - you could post them back here for more info, but generally you should perform a backup of the whole drive (or at least the files which are relevant to you) to an external drive, a different computer or a cloud-based storage service.\n\nA: As I answered a while ago, you can check the SMART status of a disk through Disk Utility... But that's really only a tiny portion of the story.\nYour disk is failing a test. Some of the SMART tests aren't too important but you need to check which it is. If it's one of the following, back up, buy another disk, and move everything off and bin the current disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Read Error Rate\n\n*Reallocated Sectors Count\n\n*Spin Retry Count\n\n*End-to-End error\n\n*Command Timeout\n\n*Reallocation Event Count\n\n*Current Pending Sector Count\n\n*Uncorrectable Sector Count\n\n*Soft Read Error Rate\n\n\nIt sounds dramatic but if one of those values is beyond its threshold, your drive has a real possibility of suffering some sort of critical failure in the near future.

The disk was dying obviously, so that reason why I stopped using my laptop for a while and thought that I will going to replace the HDD later. Running the deep scan showed me the problem at the start sectors.\nAfter a month or so I was visiting a local hardware shop and saw those external cases to convert the laptop hard drive to an external drive. I bought one reconnected to my desktop running win 7.. what do I get? No error, checked the disk again it was reporting the 4 bad sectors on a surface scan starting from 7th to 20th sector of HDD.\nNow what i did I repartitioned my HDD in to two partitions the first one having those bad sectors and second one clean. Now i reformatted my second partition and installed the system on to the second partition (yes ubuntu) and it's been over a year I never ever have that issue with that.\nSo the phrase \"your disk will become unusable is not justifiable here\" well in my case it doesn't. :) Just needed to mention one more thing here that I am booting my system using converted external HDD. :)\nHope it helps someone out there also.\nCheers!\n", "Q: questions about dual-boot install Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows 7 on same hard drive I'd like to dual-boot install Ubuntu 10.04 on the same hard drive as Windows 7 which has already been installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*As to sources on the internet:\nI found a website iinet about\ndual-boot installation of Ubuntu\n10.10 and Windows 7 on the same hard drive, which I think more specific\nthan the one on Ubuntu\nCommunity without specific\nversion of the OSes. Since I am\ninstalling Ubuntu 10.04 instead of\n10.10, my question is whether their installers are same or almost same\nand if I can follow iinet for\nmy dual-boot installation? \nOr are there better websites for\ninformation about dual-boot\ninstalltion of Ubuntu 10.04 and\nWindows 7?\n\n*As to shrinking Windows partitions\nto make free space for Ubuntu\npartitions:\niinet uses the partition\nsoftware in Ubuntu's installer to\nshrink the Windows partition. \nBut I saw in many website that the\npartition software in Ubuntu's\ninstaller cannot guarantee shrinking\nWindows 7 partitions successfully,\nso they recommended in general to\nshrink Windows partitions under\nWindows itself using its softwares.\nFor example, in Ubuntu\nCommunity, it says:\n\nSome people think that the Windows\n  partition must be resized only from\n  within Windows Vista and Windows 7\n  using the shrink/resize option. ... If you use GParted Partition Editor in the Ubuntu Live CD be careful.\n\nSo I was wondering which way to go\nin my situation?\n\n*As to partition for bootloader\nfiles:\nIn iinet, I don't see there is\na partition created and dedicated to\nboot files (i.e. Grub files). \nHowever, I saw in many websites\nstrongly suggesting using a boot\npartition for Grub files, especially\nfor the purpose of separation and\nprotection from installed OS files.\nI was wondering which way I should\nchoose and why?\n\n*As to installing bootloader Grub, \nin iinet, I see that to install\nGrub it only needs to specify the\nhard drive device for bootloader\ninstallation. \nHowever, in ubuntuguide(for\nmore than 2 OSes and Ubuntu 9.04),\nsome commands are needed to run in\norder to put Grub configuration\nfiles in MBR, and OS partition, for\nthe chain-load process (where to\nfind the files for the next stage). \nIn Ubuntu Community, there are\nsome related sentences which I don't\nquite understand how to do in\npractice:\n\nthe only thing in your computer\n  outside of Ubuntu that needs to be\n  changed is a small code in the MBR\n  (Master Boot Record) of the first hard\n  disk. The MBR code is changed to point\n  to the boot loader in Ubuntu. \nIf you have a problem with changing\n  the MBR code, you might prefer to just\n  install the code for pointing to GRUB\n  to the first sector of your Ubuntu\n  partition instead. If you do that\n  during the Ubuntu installation\n  process, then Ubuntu won't boot until\n  you configure some other boot manager\n  to point to Ubuntu's boot sector.\n  Windows Vista no longer utilizes\n  boot.ini, ntdetect.com, and ntldr when\n  booting. Instead, Vista stores all\n  data for its new boot manager in a\n  boot folder. Windows Vista ships with\n  an command line utility called\n  bcdedit.exe, which requires\n  administrator credentials to use. You\n  may want to read\n  http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=112156\n  about it.\nUsing a command line utility always\n  has its learning curve, so a more\n  productive and better job can be done\n  with a free utility called EasyBCD,\n  developed and mastered in during the\n  times of Vista Beta already. EasyBCD\n  is user friendly and many Vista users\n  highly recommend EasyBCD. \n\nIn what is quoted above, I was wondering how\nexactly I should change the MBR code\nto point to the bootloader in\nUbuntu? if I fail to change MBR\ncode, are the other suggested boot\nmanagers being bcdedit.exe and\nEasyBCD in Windows? \nWith the three sources above, which\none shall I follow?\nThanks and regards\n\nA: *\n\n*Sources\nThe official DualBoot help guide should be on your reading list. It covers a lot more including links on how to repair things should they go wrong.\nI have nothing against the \"iinet\" website you've linked to but several steps could be simplified. I'd personally opt to resize the Windows partition before running the installer. This will allow you to just select the \"Install alongside other operating systems\" option when that choice appears and that'll shave off several steps in the installer (and simplify the process).\nI guess something worth mentioning is you probably shouldn't read too much. Sounds strange but there are indeed many ways to skin a cat and if you get conflicting advice from different sources, you end up confused. Pick one way and follow it.\n\n*Shrinking NTFS\nIf fairness to gparted (et al) they offer just as much a guarantee as Windows does resizing it itself. That is to say: none.\nIf you have data on there that you can't restore with just a reinstall and a small amount of time, back up your data! You don't have to go as far as cloning the whole partition (via CloneZilla et al), you can just punt your profile (documents, photos, other media, etc) off to an external disk or even an online backup service.\nBut for what it's worth, parted (and it's graphical counterparts) is quite a robust tool that doesn't take your data integrity lightly. It will test as much as it can before doing anything. I've never had any problems with gparted in 5 years of using it.\nEither approach is equally good. Use whatever you're most comfortable with.\n\n*A /boot/ partition\nI don't see any benefit of a dedicated boot partition. It's not needed.\n\n*MBR setup\nI'd personally let Ubuntu claim the MBR on the disk (just do the standard setup) it should pick up Windows 7 and add it to the boot list.\nOf course things can go wrong at this stage but they're usually repairable. (Unlike my usual advice) I suggest you just roll with it and worry later. A lot of work goes into making Ubuntu dual-boot in a sensible way so you shouldn't need to do anything.\n\nA: You can safely run the Wubi installer from within Windows -- no need to change your harddisk partitions at all! Then, when the computer boots and before Windows starts, you get a screen where you can choose what to start. This is part of the Window boot mechanism, so nothing scary is being done.\nIf you don't like the installation, you can later remove it just like you remove any other Windows application, and Windows boots normally just as before, only now the choice to start Ubuntu is gone again.\nIf you decide that Ubuntu is exactly what you want, then you can install it \"properly\" on it's own partitions later. But by then you're already familiar with Ubuntu, which is an advantage.\nThis is what I did, and it helped me tremendously (as a new Linux user) to try it out before making any drastic changes to my computer.\n\nA: First of all I think you imagine the installation a bit more difficult than it really is. The installer is pretty smart and will guide you through that.\n1) There will be no real differences in the installer I think, you should manage just fine. BTW why 10.04, why not 10.10 right away?\n2) I don't know about that, I installed Win 7 once but after installing Ubuntu. But I did install win xp later than ubuntu some time ago and there were no troubles at all.\n3) Ive never done anything like that, dont think its necessary.\n4) Most likely the installator will do it for you, there is no need for setting anything. If not let us know then, but most likely that wont happen.\n\nA: On the /boot partition...\nSome of the docs you have read may be outdated. At one time, some computer systems were running with a BIOS that was not able to provide disk access beyond the 1024th sector. So a small partition for booting was created within the limit. After booting, the 1024 limit could be ignored (because the kernel had no such limitation - just the BIOS).\nBut, today, let's say you have a software RAID array that the BIOS cannot detect. A small /boot partition provides the method for GRUB to load the kernel, and the kernel can use the software RAID array. Or maybe in a network boot scenario, the kernel is local while the root file system is mounted. Or, for the paranoid, the boot partition could be mounted with the noauto option in /etc/fstab so that the /boot directory always appears empty until mounted.\nSo... if you do not already know why you need one, you don't need one. :)\nChris\n", "Q: How to make Nautilus name column display at the width of the longest filename Prior to a recent glytch where I lost some of my custom settings, Nautilus would open directories and display the name-column wide enough to show the longest filename on display.

It seems that this issue may be bug-related, so all bets are off on a \"normal\" outcome (until the bug is resolved)..\nThe happy offshoot of this has been that since I found out that the same feature functions properly in Compact mode, I've started using that mode instead... and for when I actually want to see the full details of List view, it's a quick as Ctrl+2 and Ctrl+3 ..

This happens to me when I'm working on servers and make a change to either .htaccess or php module.

Clearing the cache did the trick.\n\nA: If you have downloaded the code from server to your local machine. Then it's because of .htaccess file. Clear the cache then rename .htaccess to say htaccess.txt. Then you should see the webpage this time. Now your links might not be working in wordpress. So to correct this go to admin http://localhost/(wordpress-folder-name)/wp-admin .

This is required when the other end of the connection does not broadcast its capabilities. \nmiitool is obsolete, and should be replaced with ethtool as shown by @jasonbrooks. You could use your command in place of the ethtool command shown.\nethtool can be used to determine what the both ends are advertising as their capabilities.  This may help you determine if you have any other speed/duplex options.  It the other end has the equivalent settings to those which you have, it will likely appear to be advertising only 10HD.  The other end may only be capable of 10HD, or may be set to a fixed speed and duplex.\nCheck the errors shown by the command ifconfig eth0.  If you are getting frame errors, then the line is half duplex, and you should be using the 10FD settings you are using.

Is there any way to just run foo.exe?\n\nA: You can associate the file extension '.exe' on Nautilus to be executed with /usr/bin/mono\n\nA: Does this link help? Running Mono\nFrom the Mono Project on using binfmt:\nRegistering .exe as non-native binaries (Linux only)\nBecause this is a Linux-specific feature, we do not recommend that developers deploy this solution, as it would limit the portability of their scripts.\nIn addition, this mechanism does not work as intended by the Application Deployment Guidelines.\nYou can also make a systemwide change, and use binfmt to register the exe files as non-native binaries. Then, when trying to launch an exe file, the kernel will run the mono interpreter to handle the command. Binfmt can also be used to launch Windows executables using WINE, or Java .class files using a JVM. To register exe with the kernel:\nBecome root and turn on the binfmt module in your kernel with this command: \nsudo apt-get install binfmt-support\nmodprobe binfmt_misc\n\nIn addition, you may want to add the modprobe command to your /etc/rc.local boot script, so that it will be executed on boot.\nAdd the line below to your /etc/fstab file: \nbinfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc none\n\nThen, have your system run the following command on boot: \necho ':CLR:M::MZ::/usr/bin/mono:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register\n\nBe sure to mark your .exe files as executable in the filesystem as well: \nchmod +x myprogram.exe\n\nNote that this doesn't change your kernel, just the modules that it loads when you boot your system.

I was hoping to have a 2 seat setup. One will be for my TV just going to run Boxee. The other is for my main Desktop. \nI've been looking for a good guide to help me navigate this, I'd like to use ubuntu 10.10. I am assuming it's just a case of getting a box and two graphics adaptors as well as a usb mice and keyboard, and then another, which will be bluetooth for the TV.\nI can't seem to find much documentation on this idea. Can anyone point me in the right direction? \nAlso I am assuming that this is all possible with a standard ubuntu install, but with some additional configuration.\n\nA: The Ubuntu Wiki has some instructions for 10.04 on this. Also mdm is mentioned sometimes, and maybe you can follow this 10.10 tutorial.\n\nA: As far as I can tell, there's no (free) GUI-which-works-out-of-the-box solution for this. I guess what you have to do is to adapt your XOrg configuration file and tell it which monitor-keyboard-mouse combinations go together. \nThe best resource I can point you to is this AskSlashdot thread. You'll find plenty of links there. But beware: it looks like you should have some linux experience, especially with editing config files etc.\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring) and 13.10 (Saucy):\nUbuntu 13.10 (Saucy) switched to logind, which has much better multiseat support than ConsoleKit (the seat management software used in 13.04 (Raring) and older).  Much of the work that went into switching to logind is actually present in Raring, so with some effort it's possible to use logind with Raring.\nDespite switching to logind, certain key packages (notably lightdm and xserver-xorg-core) still have some issues with multiseat support.  The ubuntu-multiseat team is actively working on uploading fixes to these issues to the ubuntu-multiseat PPA.\nTo set up multiseat on 13.04 (Raring) or 13.10 (Saucy), you can follow the instructions on the ubuntu-multiseat PPA page.  The following is a summary of those instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add some udev rules to assign devices (keyboards, mice, video cards, etc.) to seats.  Details can be found on the PPA page and the systemd multiseat page.\n\n*Edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and tell LightDM about your seats.\n\n*Update to the packages in the ubuntu-multiseat PPA.\n\n\nSetting up multiseat correctly is currently very hard; hopefully this will get easier in future versions of Ubuntu.\n\nA: Have a look at the new Ubuntu 11.10. The key to multiseat seems to lie in configuring lightdm, the new display manager of Ubuntu. Unfortunately, the Ubuntu Wiki (as referred to above) only gives instructions for kdm, not lightdm.\n\nA: I built exactly this system (but with MythTV) using an older version of Ubuntu and provided detailed set up instructions in this doc page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV_Multiseat?action=recall&rev=1  The page was \"removed\" because it was deemed out of date and no longer relevant.\nWhile the instructions were from when I last rebuilt the system for 8.10, I have upgraded this system through 10.04LTS which I'm presently using.\nNote that my TV output uses the Hauppauge PVR-350's audio / video out.  The PVR-350 is an analog TV capture card which has a HW encoder for video output (and has not been supported by Myth for the last several releases).   To my knowledge, this device has the unique property that it can handle the audio output entirely separately from the normal Linux sound path.  This makes the multi-seat simple once the video and HID aspects of X.org are addressed.\nIf you don't use the PVR-350, you just need to substitute the appropriate video card info for your TV output.  I do not know how to handle the audio, however.  I am actively trying to find a solution for the audio since my PVR-350 is failing and I need to reconfigure my system since I am about to lose my analog cable.\n\nA: A short update for Ubuntu 20.10 (or in general Ubuntu with systemd) which makes this very easy by following the instructions in the Debian Wiki. Note that you also don't really need additional graphic cards. Docking stations or USB devices which support video output already meet the requirements.\nIt boils down to the following procedure:\n\n*\n\n*List attached devices and look for video cards containing drm.\n\nloginctl seat-status seat0\n\n\n*Create a new seat with the secondary video card. Make sure to add your device identifiers. The following are just my examples.\n\nloginctl attach seat1 /sys/devices/platform/evdi.0/drm/card0\n\n\n*Restart the PC.\n\n*Now you should already have two login screens. But the second one is missing keyboard and mouse input. So add these and then everything is set up.\n\nloginctl attach seat1 /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-2/1-2.2/1-2.2.3 # Mouse\nloginctl attach seat1 /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-2/1-2.2/1-2.2.1 # Keyboard\nP.S.: This post was written from seat1.\n", "Q: How do I set the CPU frequency scaling governor for all cores at once? I'd like to set the CPU frequency scaling governor for all cores at once instead of doing it individually for each core. Is there a way to do this?\n(I know it would be easy to echo the governor to /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor, but I'm not looking for a custom solution.)\n\nA: You can do this for all cores at once by running \nsudo cpupower frequency-set --governor performance\n\n\nA: Might as well add bash code completion, while we're at it:\nfunction setgovernor () {\n    echo \"$1\" | sudo tee \n    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor \n}\ncomplete -W \"$(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors)\" setgovernor\n\n\nA: I googled a lot and I think it's just not possible, so I added the following one-liner to my .bashrc:\nfunction setgov ()\n{\n    echo \"$1\" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor \n}\n\nNow I can run something like setgov ondemand and all cores will switch to the ondemand governor.\n\nA: I'm still a linux noob but don't you think cpufrequtils lets u do it by using\n(its not bundled in the Ubuntu OS but is there in the repository)\nsudo apt-get install cpufrequtils\nsudo cpufreq-set -r -g performance\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The -r flag is used to set the change for all (\"all hardware related\") cores\n\n\nA: The way I set this to stick since the governor defaults back to powersave after about 30 seconds now as of Ubuntu 16.04 or more recent (I'm on Ubuntu Mate);\n\n\n*\n\n*Put this (one line of) code (thank you, courtesy of switch87 in the previous answer)\nsleep 60 && bash -c 'for i in {0..7}; do cpufreq-set -c $i -g performance; done'\n\n\n*into the file in the directory\n/etc/rc.local\n\nMine is a line above \"exit 0\" and uncommented, under the commented ones.\n\"rc.local\" for those who do not know, it runs the command as sudo. Any command it seems, to change the governor, needs to be run as sudo.\nIt lets the governor reset back to powersave and runs the code as sudo after 60 seconds to change it back to performance.\nChange the \"60\" (in the code you copy) to whatever time (in seconds. 60 = 60 seconds= 1 minute) you need to delay the command and \"performance\" (in the command part) to what governor you want it to change to.\nOut of my hours and hours of searching I have not found a more permanent fix for this than this.\nI figure what's a couple of minutes that it's on powersave if this is the best fix I've found, right? Right.\nNot the best fix, but it makes it somewhat permanent after it does it's little switch to powersave thing. If you want to boot right up and jump into a game or something you're going to have to wait a minute for the code you just put in to switch it back from powersave or lower the timing on it (depending on how long it takes everything to start up so it'll switch back to performance correctly).\nAnd, as always, to revert back to default (I've seen some issues with people's PCs overheating which is why they might have defaulted it to powersave in the first place) just remove the code from rc.local and reboot or switch it back manually with your cpu icon indicator switcher or run;\n sudo /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils restart\n\nin the terminal and or reboot.\n\nA: the shortest command to change governor of all cores is the following:\nsudo bash -c 'for ((i=0;i<$(nproc);i++)); do cpufreq-set -c $i -g performance; done'\n\nYou could add it to .bashrc like htorque mentioned setgov performance:\nfunction setgov ()\n{\n     for i in {0..7}; \n     do \n         sudo  cpufreq-set -c $i -g $1; # run cpufreq-set with root\n     done\n}\n\n\nA: Basing on switch87's answer, I made a simple script cpufreq-set-all, which will allow to do other cpufreq-set things with all CPUs:\n   #!/bin/bash\n   MAX_CPU=$((`nproc --all` - 1))\n   for i in $(seq 0 $MAX_CPU); do\n       echo \"Changing CPU \" $i \" with parameter \"$@;\n       cpufreq-set -c $i $@ ;\n   done\n\nNow it can be invoked(after chmod +x, of course) like this:\ncpufreq-set-all -g powersave\n\nor\ncpufreq-set-all -f 800Mhz\n\n\nA: sometimes setting the governor isn't enough. I had to set the MAX and MIN variables for frequency as well, because the scaling policies had them set to minimum, so what I do is\n\n*\n\n*Get the min and max scaling frequencies from CPU 0\n\n*Divide them by a million to get the frequency in GHz\n\n*Pipe the result through bc so I can get the result in floating point(BASH can only handle integers) - scale=1 is how many decimals\n\n*Check if a scaling governor is supplied on the command line\n\n*If not, set ONDEMAND - save some money when idling\n\n*Run the cpufreq-set command in a loop on all CPU-s\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    echo \"Setting all CPUs to \" \"$@\"\n    CPUINFO_MIN_FREQ=$(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_min_freq)\n    CPUINFO_MAX_FREQ=$(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq)\n    MIN=$(echo \"scale=1; $CPUINFO_MIN_FREQ / 1000000\" | bc)\"G\"\n    MAX=$(echo \"scale=1; $CPUINFO_MAX_FREQ / 1000000\" | bc)\"G\"\n    \n    echo \"Minimum frequency: \" $MIN \", Maximum frequency: \" $MAX\n    \n    GOVERNOR=@0\n    if [ $# -eq 0 ]\n        then\n            echo \"No arguments supplied, using ONDEMAND governor\"\n            GOVERNOR=\"ondemand\"\n        else\n            echo \"Governor \" $1 \" supplied\"\n            GOVERNOR=$1\n    fi\n    \n    for ((i=0;i<$(nproc);i++));\n        do cpufreq-set -c $i -r -g $GOVERNOR  --min $MIN --max $MAX;\n    done\n\n", "Q: How to get the 10.10 Ambiance theme on 10.04 The new theme looks better and polished than the on on 10.04.

But we also have a stupid amount of disk space and a media centre (Boxee) so the DVDs are getting less and less use. It would be nice to convert our DVDs into something more relevant to our needs.\nI've dabbled with DVD ripping before but whereas I'd usually transcode down to a smaller picture size with a better video compression algorithm, this takes a silly amount of time. I don't have a couple of hours available for each disk. (Sidebar: is there dedicated,  Linux-friendly hardware to improve h264 encoding performance?)\nSo I was wondering if there's anything that take the DVD filesystem, De-CSS it, and then stitch together any the VOBs that make up the main part of the film and package that up in a wrapping format like MKV. A bonus would be if it could grab the subtitles and stick them in too but that's not a requirement as Boxee can grab the subtitles online if it needs to.\n\nA: I tried mkvtoolnix and it did it instantly, maybe because of copy-on-write feature of Btrfs I use.\n\nA: There are probably many options, but I use k9copy for this.  I use the wizard and select the option \"Rip DVD without encoding\".  It produces a single MPEG-2 file of the selected tracks.\n\nA: MakeMKV seems to be working for me.\nhttp://www.makemkv.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=224\nJust extracts the non-trivial sized titles from a DVD, puts them un-transcoded in an MKV file. Includes default audio track and the subtitles tracks.\nAlso does blu-ray apparently (I don't have a drive)\nHandbrake doesn't do what you're asking for but it's the best I've found so far for making painless, compressed copied of titles on commercial DVDs\nhttp://handytutorial.com/install-handbrake-in-ubuntu-12-10-quantal/\nThat guides for 12.10, but it works just fine for 12.04 as well.\nThe bit that had me stumped was the package is called handbrake-gtk, not handbrake.\nMy first attempt with handbrake has compressed 40 minute extras video from a DVD from 1.3GB to 0.3 GB at > 100fps on my PC of, at this point, fairly obsolete power.\nHowever the loss in quality was noticeable to my overly critical eye, but you can bump the quality easily by decreasing the quality slider by small amounts.\n\nA: I usually copy the whole DVD into an ISO image. VLC can read those directly I guess many other programs can do the same. The speed is maximal (I just compared to k9copy which is at same speed when just copying) and a wide range of burning applications can be used for that. I usually employ k3b for that. Note, all menus, languages and subtitles are then still available in one file. But if space is really a concern and you don't want foreign subtitles then copying 8GB DVDs is probably not the thing what you are looking for and you should consider re-encoding too. I don't know if those ISOs are De-CSSed (I guess not), but who cares?, almost all players can handle this by now (even its illegal in some countries). In case you want also to remove copyright infringement notices I would also use k9copy for that.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Sync for multiple folders in Windows, not just the Ubuntu One folder I may have misunderstood Ubuntu One as a service, but this is how I had pictured it.

What I really want is to stop icons even appearing in that part of the desktop window: that is, I want to make part of the desktop real estate \"off-limits\" to new icons appearing on the desktop.\n\nA: You can get what you want if you change these two lines as shown:\n own_window_type panel\n\n own_window_transparent no\n\nAnd you add these two:\n own_window_argb_visual yes\n\n own_window_argb_value 0\n\nExplanation:\nown_window_argb_visual yes enables true transparency (own_window_transparent yes means just pseudo-transparency, which just 'clones' background... we have to set this latter to no, that's why we need to edit the second line above)\nown_window_argb_value 0 sets 'alpha' to 0 (totally transparent). It can be set up to 255 (totally opaque)\nown_window_argb_visual yes won't work with override and that's why it's necesary to change own_window_type to panel\nFor me it worked flawlesly. The only drawback is that you can see the icon but you can't click it, as it is, still, under conky's window; however, you can select this icon clicking and dragging the mouse -a windowed selection-.... after that, you can bring up context menu with the keyboard or simply press enter to 'open' the media you just inserted.\n\nA: For Maverick, and assuming Gnome...\nsudo apt-get install screenlets\n\nDownload Folderview Screenlet and then open Screenlets to install it.\nApplications->Accessories->Screenlets\n\nAfter installation, double-click the \"Folder View\" screenlet. Right-click on the screenlet and choose Properties. Go to Options->Folder and select Desktop. Click Close.\nNow make your Gnome Desktop icons disappear:\n[ALT]+[F2]\ngconf-editor\nRun\n\nGo to apps->nautilus->preferences->show_desktop, setting the value to false. Move your \"Folder View\" screenlet away from Conky.\nYou can still access \"places\" and \"devices\" from the file manager. In fact, you can do everything with no Desktop icons at all. Just running gconf-editor to disable Desktop icons might work for you, too.\n\nA: I do not think this is possible. However, depending settings, you should be able to move your Conky by holding you Alt key and use your left mouse button (given that you use right-handed settings) and move it like any other window.\nYou can also remove icons on desktop altogether in gconf-editor. Just disable /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop and your desktop will be nice and clean.\n\nA: Read Conky faqs at this link: http://conky.sourceforge.net/faq.html\nSpecifically these two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Conky won't stop flickering\n\n*Why does Conky make my icons disappear?\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu One not getting connected When I click on connect button in my ubuntu one client it again says connect not disconnect.\n\nA: Not sure about the exact issue you're facing, but it sounds familiar. What did help me was to do the following in a Terminal:\nu1sdtool -q\nu1sdtool --start\nu1sdtool -c\n\nThe first will quit the program, the second will start it and the third connect it. I have had error messages whilst doing so, but I've found that it seems to need me to do this to connect eventually. Also, if you have many folders and sub-folders and files, it will first need to scan all files before connecting to your Ubuntu, so whilst it might remain on stating \"connect\", it might in fact be preparing Ubuntu One to Connect. It has taken me up to an hour or so to Connect...\nThere is also ubuntuone-indicator you could install, and magicicada or something. \nsudo apt-get install *\nBoth give you more details as to what your client is actually doing! \nHope this helps, and hope someone who knows about Ubuntu will clarify/confirm what I wrote :)\nbisi\n\nA: I have a similar issue.\nUbuntu One client does not seem to connect.

When I installed Ubuntu 10.04, I installed it on a single 16GB partition which includes /, /boot, /home etc.\nI have another partition on the system (ext3). It is easily accessible from the GNOME desktop Places menu: I just click that Filesystem HDD icon on the Places menu and it is automatically mount as '/media/1326f40a-45df-4ec'.\nHow do I make that partition re-mount as /home instead? (permanently, that is)\n\nA: In looking up a similar issue I found this thread.  I wanted to touch base on a couple things.\nFirst, IMHO, the UUID is desperate and unworkable.  There is a better solution than using the UUID that works on 10.04 of Ubuntu.  That is to use the LABEL='label'.\nIn the /etc/fstab file swap the UUID with the LABEL='<label>' (and be sure to use the single quotes).  Before doing this please ensure that you have used gparted to add a label to the drive.  This label is just like the label you might have created to identify your floppies, your zip drives (not files), or even your old HDDs under Windows.\nThe next thing I wanted to touch on is that above someone gave the following command.\nsudoedit /etc/fstab\n\nThat command I have never seen before.  Either it is something that I didn't know exists or it is wrong.  In the case that it might be wrong I'll correct the syntax.\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nFinally I appreciate the person that appears to have given the proper answer where you want to have a folder under the root of the partition as your home.  The procedure described in this thread does not touch on that even though it is the most APPROPRIATE implementation.  You should always put your home folder in a folder under the partition instead of pushing your home folder into the root folder of the partition.\n\nA: First you want the UUID of the drive so it can be reliably mounted.\nsudo blkid\n\nThat will return a list of all your partitions and their UUIDs. Just note the UUID of the partition you want mounted as home.\nThen you just need to edit /etc/fstab to auto-mount that partition as /home.\nsudoedit /etc/fstab\n\nAnd add a line like this:\nUUID=0c89eb5d-ac58-46c0-b309-597b35a542e8 /home ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\nAlthough obviously with your UUID, not mine. Save and reboot.\n\nA: Here is the official Ubuntu documentation for moving to a separate /home partition:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\nJust skip the step for creating a new partition as you already have it.\n\nA: If you are installing a fresh system the easiest way is to choose an special partition layout and declare one of the partitions as /home and another one as /.\nThe effect is equivalent to editing fstab as in the other answers, but this method has the advantage that you do this from the start.\n", "Q: Can I use Visa Electron to pay for ubuntu one service? I want to pay for Ubuntu mobile, but I only have Visa (Electron Debit card). Can I use Visa Electron to pay for ubuntu one service?\n\nA: Unfortunately Visa Electron cards normally aren't real Visa cards, they're debit only cards and worse they're payment up front cards. This makes them expensive and unusual to process as you need a clearing house that supports them (Electron is to Visa what the old Solo was to Switch and meant for the really poor who don't even have enough credit to have their balance protected).\nAnyway, back on track, the payment methods don't currently allow for visa electron. But you may be able to get hold of a pre-paid credit card (depending on your country) which you can use to do the transaction. They come with a fixed amount of money and it's a little more work, but you could get the job done.\nThe other option is to ask a friend with a real credit card to use his card instead and you give them the cash.\n", "Q: How to switch between chat windows in Kadu?

I have Ubuntu 10.10 installed on a machine for my parents. The thing is they never request updates from Update Manager even the manager itself prompted them so. Moreover, when they are done with whatever they are doing on Ubuntu, they always leave the computer on. And I always have to come back and shut the machine down. Sometimes, the computer even sit idle for hours.\nSo I want to know whether this is possible in Ubuntu. I am thinking of a script that will be activated after the machine is idle for x minutes. When x minutes have elapsed, Update Manager will automatically update everything listed. (I recall that you need the admin password for this, so is there a workaround?) After all the updates are done, the machine will automatically shutdown.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: There are a few packages that may help with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*unattended-upgrades installs security updates automatically\n\n*powernap suspends or shuts down the computer when there are no processes running from a given list\nAlthough finding the right list of important processes may be difficult... powernap is more targeted at servers.\n\nA: I am thinking that you could start with a screensaver, so you now get the hook for Idleness done for you, which then kicks off the update in background and shutdown. I say in background, with nohup so even if the screensaver is dismissed the update isn't killed stone dead (log this, and it's stderror somewhere you can get to though!). The shutdown however should be based on the update finishing AND machine being still Idle, so nobody gets a surprise shutdown.\nBear in mind that not all Ubuntu updates will run unattended - which may put a spanner in your works here.\n", "Q: How to make xinput settings persist after devices are unplugged, replugged, and after shutdown, restart, etc? I successfully followed the answer to this question to set different sensitivities for my touchpad and my USB mouse. Only problem is, once you unplug and replug the device or shutdown, restart etc., the settings reset.\n\nA: According to How to configure the TrackPoint (from ThinkWiki), the method for changing the settings on a per-user basis is by using the .xsessionrc file, simply put all your xinput commands into that file and you should have your settings on boot.\nThe settings should be remembered after you unplug and replug the same device. But if they're not then we have a bug to report. I looked into all the events that happen when input devices are detected and I don't mind telling you that it's a real mess. If you need to go to a plan B then try adding the options into x.conf.d as shown in the above website.\n\nA: I know this is a bit old, but in Ubuntu 14.04 I couldn't find a .xsessionrc or x.conf.d file, so I had to use xinput from the terminal. This is how you do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the name of your device:\nxinput list\n\n\n*See available options for your device:\nxinput list-props \"Your Device Name\"\n\n\n*Edit settings (to make settings consistent after reboot/shutdown just add this command to Startup Applications):\nxinput set-prop \"Your Device Name\" \"Option Name\" \"Value\"\n\nHere is an example command I used to activate locked drags in my touchpad:\nxinput set-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Locked Drags\" 1\n\nTo activate/change another option just look for it in your device available options and play with them until you get the desired result.\nYou now know which commands resolve your problems. They may be more than one. Your next job is to add these commands to 'Startup Applications'. To do so: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open 'Startup Applications'. \n\n*Click 'Add' and in the command field paste the desired command. Click 'Add'. You have added the first command.\n\n*Add the other commands too in similar fashion (if you have more than one command). You are done. Next time you restart your computer, Ubuntu will automatically run these commands which will fix your mouse issues.\n\nA: I've had to put it in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-map.conf (and reboot) to be permanent not only over reboots but also over suspend/resume.\n#instead of: xinput set-button-map \"2.4G Wireless Optical Mouse\" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 \nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier  \"2.4G Wireless Optical Mouse\"\n    Option  \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\"\nEndSection\n\n(if I put it just in .xsession or similar it would get executed on reboot / relogin, but would still reset to defaults after suspend/resume)\n\nA: Use the Startup Applications program.\nType in the terminal command and use \" to separate the values.\ne.g.:\nxinput set-button-map \"12\" \"1\" \"1\" \"3\"  \n\nSave and it works.\n", "Q: Can I control where default focus is for an application?

Is there an easy way to allow my other computers to resolve my hostname over the network without having them edit their hosts files or their DNS settings? Some of the computers are on Windows.\n\nA: In mixed network environments you can do this with name resolutions from Avahi/Zeroconfig that would resolve in Mac-OS as well as in Windows (when Bonjour is running). See also this answer.\n\nA: In all recent Ubuntu installs you can use hostname.local and it just works. I believe this means mDNS is set up automatically, but as it's always just worked (except with some routers in some hotels, where I'd get a notification about it being disabled because of a broken router), I haven't had to dig in.\n\nA: If you install SAMBA then Windows machines that don't speak mDNS will resolve your hostname using that.\n\nA: To resolve Avahi hostnames, other computers should have libnss-mdns installed.\nAnother option, if you are the network administrator is to distribute a private DNS address by DHCP (I your computers are configured by DHCP). For a small network, dnsmasq is good combined package (DNS+DHCP). It allows you to serve simply your /etc/hosts to the network.\n", "Q: Where are panel launchers located?

To do that you'll need to contact 7digital's business arm and work out a deal (where you can also get answers for your other sub-questions).\nThey have a separate contact page (and website for that matter) for business-related queries here:\nhttp://about.7digital.net/Contacts\n", "Q: Can you delete the Humanity icon theme safely?

(copied icon paths, then removed the 'Encoding=UTF-8' line, etc.).\nNone of the above helped. So the question remains: Why?\nIs there some type of \"registry\" out there?\n\nA: The launchers are registered in subfolders of /apps/panel/objects in the GConf settings database:\n\nTo backup all your panel launchers, you will need to copy both the launchers and their registrations:\n\n\n*\n\n*launchers: $HOME/.gnome2/panel2.d/default/launchers/\n\n*registrations: $HOME/.gconf/apps/panel/objects/\n", "Q: How to run a script without closing the terminal? I have a script in file bla.sh and it is executable. When I click on it, the script is executed and the window is closed. I'd like the window to stay open.\nSomething like command cmd /k** command in Windows.\nP.S. I don't want to use pause, but I want to able to write more commands after the script was executed.\n\nA: Use bash's --init-file option with a temporary pipe:\nbash --init-file <(echo './<script_name>')\n\nEx:\nbash --init-file <(echo './bla.sh')\n\n\nA: If you are using xterm use -hold.\n\nA: Using xterm and appending ;bash at the end of the command string works. For example:\nxterm -e \"bash ~/script.sh;bash\"\n\nThis does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*opens xterm\n\n*executes the script script.sh\n\n*shows the bash prompt after the script has finished.\n\n\nYou can exit the xterm window by closing the window or type exit at the bash prompt. Or you can type more commands as requested.\n\nA: xterm -e bash --rcfile bla.sh\n\nThis will run the script in a new window, and even give you control of the window after it is finished.\nHowever the new window will not load ~/.bashrc as normal, since we ran bla.sh instead. This can be remedied by putting\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nat the top of bla.sh\n\nA: TLDR;\nUse exec bash; or exec $SHELL; at the end of a command to keep the terminal open after running the command.\nDetails and sample test code\nThere isn't an answer showing exec bash as the right answer, but there should be, so here it is. This answer is borrowed in part from @Karsvo's answer, @Stefano Palazo's answer, and @Andrea Corbellini's comment under Stefano's answer.\nOn my system (this was last tested and checked on Ubuntu 20.04), echo $SHELL shows that the SHELL variable contains /bin/bash. which bash shows that the bash executable is located in /usr/bin/bash, however. BUT, /user/bin/bash and /bin/bash are identical executables, as proven by having the same sha256sum:\n$ which bash\n/usr/bin/bash\n\n$ sha256sum $(which bash)\n04a484f27a4b485b28451923605d9b528453d6c098a5a5112bec859fb5f2eea9  /usr/bin/bash\n\n$ sha256sum $SHELL\n04a484f27a4b485b28451923605d9b528453d6c098a5a5112bec859fb5f2eea9  /bin/bash\n\nTherefore, using bash in place of $SHELL is identical. Also, I've determined that all 3 of these at the end will keep the terminal open: bash, eval bash, exec bash, but only the latter, exec bash, will then allow you to close the terminal without it warning you a process is still running. Therefore, the best to use is exec bash or exec $SHELL, as @AndreaCorbellini says in his comment.\nTest 1: this will work as expected\nHere's what this might look like in a use-case of having a script to open up two new gnome-terminal tabs already cded into your ~/some_dir directory:\nAdd to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file:\nopen_default_tabs() {\n    gnome-terminal --tab -- bash -ic \"cd ~/some_dir; exec bash;\"\n    gnome-terminal --tab -- bash -ic \"cd ~/some_dir; exec bash;\"\n}\n\nOR: again, you can use exec $SHELL here instead as well:\nopen_default_tabs() {\n    gnome-terminal --tab -- bash -ic \"cd ~/some_dir; exec $SHELL;\"\n    gnome-terminal --tab -- bash -ic \"cd ~/some_dir; exec $SHELL;\"\n}\n\nThen in any gnome-terminal already open, re-source your ~/.bashrc file with . ~/.bashrc, then run this command with:\nopen_default_tabs\n\n...and you'll see your original gnome-terminal tab plus two new tabs, with both of the two new tabs already cded into the ~/some_dir directory.\nIf you delete the exec bash; or exec $SHELL; portion from the end of each of the commands above, however, then re-source your ~/.bashrc file with . ~/.bashrc, then run the open_default_tabs command again, you'll see that the tabs flicker open then immediately close. All you'll see is a couple quick flashes. The exec bash; or exec $SHELL; part at the end is required to keep these new tabs open.\nTest 2: this proves that exec bash; works. BUT, the behavior regarding gnome-terminal isn't quite as expected. To solve that, see my more-complicated answer and work-around in my other answer here.\nIn test.sh:\ngnome-terminal --tab -- bash -ic \"cd ~/some_dir; exec bash;\"\ngnome-terminal --tab -- bash -ic \"cd ~/some_dir; exec bash;\"\n\nEnsure some_dir exists, and make test.sh executable:\nmkdir -p ~/some_dir\nchmod +x test.sh\n\nRun it:\n./test.sh\n\nNotice the two windows (not tabs, in this case, due to a problem in gnome-terminal) which were just opened stay open. Delete exec bash; above and you'll see they don't--they instantly close--so fast you won't even see them open. This proves exec bash; is working perfectly. The gnome-terminal behavior isn't quite as expected, but that has nothing to do with exec bash;, which works just fine. Again, see my other answer here for a full work-around to the problem specific to gnome-terminal in this case.\nRelated:\n\n*\n\n*Here's why I REALLY needed this information! This is my \"other answer\" I mention above: Open Terminal with multiple tabs and execute application\n\nA: Using Gnome Terminal\nUsing gnome-terminal appending ;bash at the end of the command string and calling the script with -c option works. For example:\ngnome-terminal -e \"bash -c ~/script.sh;bash\"\n\nThis does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*opens gnome-terminal\n\n*executes the script script.sh\n\n*shows the bash prompt after the script has finished.\n\n\nYou can exit the gnome-terminal window by closing the window or type exit at the bash prompt. Or you can type more commands as requested.\n\nA: If you have access to the script, you may also add the following code at the end:\nread\n\nThat code will wait for an input before closing, so the terminal will stay open until you press Enter.\n\nA: Put $SHELL at the end of your script:\n\nA small flaw: since gnome-terminal isn't running the bash as it's shell, it will regard it as an application and display a warning about it when you try to close the terminal:\nThere is still a process running in this terminal\nClosing the terminal will kill it.\n\nI've found no nice way to hide this warning. If you want, you can disable it entirely by running:\ngconftool --set /apps/gnome-terminal/global/confirm_window_close --type boolean false\n\nThis doesn't happen if you're using xterm instead of gnome-terminal; should it bother you.\n", "Q: What does this icon mean in the UbuntuOne sign up screen?

You should have an “on hover” text for those alert icons; in fact, I can see them right now.

So things like Firefox, Gedit, Chromium, etc. The majority of applications that are only i386/x86_32bit only will still install and run without any additional changes needed. Even less will have issues with linked or shared system libraries. You can install the ia32-libs package which will install most needed 32bit shared libraries needed for 32bit software to work.\n\nA: I don't see how installing a 64bit OS on a CPU that supports it (most have done for years now) is a mistake, it makes perfect sense to make use of the benefits of 64-bit architecture!  I must say, for at least the last few years, apart from 64bit flash issues, I've not had to worry about this at all.\nSaying that, what are you trying to run?  My system has a few 32-bit libraries and i386/i686 .deb's I've force installed (which seem to be architecture independent anyway), and you might notice that your's works the same.\nDoes the app you're attempting to run work on the 64bit system?\n\nA: To compile and install 32-bit applications on 64-bit Ubuntu we should not forget to mention getlibs that is also available from Jamin W Collins' ppa.

Same advice for the scan drivers. i used the linux scangear drivers 1.4 for mp550 (from 2010) and they work as a charme.

Now for some reasons this packages gets renamed mynewpackage  in the next release. As the package manager doesn't know anything about renaming packages it will treat mypackage and mynewpackage as different packages so that on upgrade users who have mypackage not get mynewpackage installed but stay with the old mypackage (if the dependencies allow that).\nTo avoid this the package maintainer simply creates a transitional package mypackage in the new release that doesn't have any files but just a depends on mynewpackage (this kind of package is called a \"meta package\"). \n", "Q: System time off by a small amount On Karmic (9.10), my system time is currently off by 17 minutes, e.g. when I type date on the terminal I get Thu Jan  6 16:22:29 CST 2011 while the correct time is 16:05pm.

Those that don't want the old applications are free to remove them manually.\nThe exception to this is if new tools conflict with previous tools, then the previous tools will be removed, but this shouldn't be the case with apps like music players or photo editors.\nLibreOffice as far as I can see is replacing OpenOffice.org. The version of OpenOffice.org that Ubuntu and most other Linux distributions were shipping had several patches from Novell that Sun/Oracle never accepted but are now included in LibreOffice. I don't even think there will be a 3.3 build of OpenOffice.org in the Ubuntu repositories and trying to keep both installed isn't really useful.\n", "Q: Should I enable root account for rsync? How can I enable the root account? I know it is not usually recommended but I'd like to setup a non-interactive script to backup my server using rsync.

My laptop has recently started to become a bit unreliable, and for some reason I started to suspect that my HDD was starting to fail. After a bit of hunting on the internet, I found Ubuntu's Disk Utility in the System menu and ran the long SMART diagnostics from this.\nHowever, since the documentation for Disk Utility is very poor (palimpsest?), I'm not sure how to interpret the results:\n\nFor example, the Read Error Rate is over 50 million (!), yet the Assessment is rated \"Good\". \nSo would someone mind explaining to me how to interpret the results of these tests (especially the Normalized, Worst, Threshold and Value numbers)? And maybe tell me what they think of the results I got for my HDD? (Thanks) \n\nA: You have a good description of how SMART works on wikipedia. But a quick intro:\n\n*\n\n*Value: This is the raw value that the controller reports. Usually it's an easy to understand value (like power on hours or temperature), but sometimes it isn't (like the read error rate). Different manufacturers can use different structures and meanings for this data.\n\n\n*Normalized: This is the above value normalized so a higher value is always better. So a 114 in read/error rates is better than 113. Again, how your hard drive converts raw data to normalized value is vendor specific.\n\n\n*Worst: The worst normalized value that your drive had in the past (where 99 is likely the factory setting).\n\n\n*Threshold: When the normalized value is lower than this value the drive is likely to fail.\nSo, your hard disk seem to be ok. The value of the read error rate is not the times that your drive failed, but some data struct that depends on your disk manufacturer.\n\nA: Yes, generally the raw value for read error rate is nonsense.  The values you want to keep an eye on are the reallocated sector count, pending count, and offline uncorrectable.  Those are the count of bad sectors that have been, are waiting to be, or can not be corrected, and the raw values there generally make sense and are the count of sectors.\nIf reading a sector fails, it becomes pending.  The next time you try to write to that sector, the drive attempts to rewrite it, and if that works, everything goes back to normal.  If it can not correctly write the sector, then it will reallocate the sector from the spare pool.  If it can't do that ( maybe it's used up the spare pool already? ), then it just becomes offline_uncorrectable and trying to read or write to it just errors out.\n\nA: psusi nails it.\nIf you read the data sheets (white papers) say at seagate.com\nyou will see how HDD's are made, tested and how they really work.\nThere is no perfect HDD, never was, never will be, (history and fact).\nIn the olden days, we had to enter the bad sectors in to the HDD controller\nfrom a list on paper that came in the new drive box, so the controller skips them.\nModern drives have error correction. From day 1 sectors are bad.\nSo they map them out, this means the drive skips bad sectors.\nIn fact they are \"logically swapped out\" - the bad sector is mapped to a new, good, spare cylinder sector (it has spare cylinders - think of cylinders as tracks). This is all transparent to the outside world - except  for the SMART util.\nEach manufacturer can do as they please, so some set the error counts to zero, even though there might be 10 bad sectors as soon as the drive is manufactured.\nThere is a 3 times rule in the drive's firmware - it reads a sector 3 times and if all 3 times it is bad then it may do a \"recalibrate\" on the fly, and read 3 more times. If the drive is still not ok it will map that sector to one of the spare sectors. This is deep in the firmware, but happens continually in the background, all transparent  to the user.\nWhether the manufacturer chooses to report raw errors whenever there are 3 bad reads or after the calibrate is up to them. So like he says above, it's not important unless you have many drives of the same kind and you see some odd trends.\nPoint 2: all HDD have natural read errors, you can learn that at Seagate too, if you want. but they all have errors on the fly. and are read again, and usually pass the test for CRC errors.  if not the DRIVE tries to swap it out.\nif you run the disk cool, it will last a long time and you many never run out of spare cylinders. but do look at that as psusi tells you !  \nI'm typing this , on an old PC , running one of the first 1gb HDD ever made. and is still good.

Might not work for everyone, but just in case ;)\n\nA: Just a brief note - I'm using Natty, and thanks to @谢继雷's answer, I noticed that the following is reported by moving the terminal in each of the four 'workspaces' in Unity: \n$ wmctrl -d\n# top left\n0  * DG: 2048x1200  VP: 0,0  WA: 0,24 1024x576  Workspace 1\n# bottom left\n0  * DG: 2048x1200  VP: 0,600  WA: 0,24 1024x576  Workspace 1\n# top right\n0  * DG: 2048x1200  VP: 1024,0  WA: 0,24 1024x576  Workspace 1\n# bottom right \n0  * DG: 2048x1200  VP: 1024,600  WA: 0,24 1024x576  Workspace 1\n\n... i.e. they are not neither separate desktops, nor workspaces - simply the viewport changes! \nSo, to change between those four viewports, simply call the wmctrl -o command directly with the VP values listed above, i.e.:\nwmctrl -o 0,0\nwmctrl -o 0,600\nwmctrl -o 1024,0\nwmctrl -o 1024,600\n\nEDIT: Ups, sorry, just saw this is the same as @wik's answer - merge/delete as appropriate..\n", "Q: Is there a public list anywhere of people who have signed the Canonical Contributor Agreement?

Depending on the complexity of what one tries to achieve with string replacement, and depending on tools with which user is familiar, some methods may be preferred more  than others. \nIn this answer I am using simple input.txt file, which you can use to test all examples provided here. The file contents:\nroses are red , violets are blue\nThis is an input.txt and this doesn't rhyme\n\nBASH\nBash isn't really meant for text processing, but simple substitutions can be done via parameter expansion , in particular here we can use simple structure ${parameter/old_string/new_string}.  \n#!/bin/bash\nwhile IFS= read -r line\ndo\n    case \"$line\" in\n       *blue*) printf \"%s\\n\" \"${line/blue/azure}\" ;;\n       *) printf \"%s\\n\" \"$line\" ;;\n    esac\ndone < input.txt\n\nThis small script doesn't do in-place replacement, meaning that you would have to save new text to new file, and get rid of the old file, or mv new.txt old.txt\nSide note: if you're curious about why while IFS= read -r ; do ... done < input.txt is used, it's basically shell's way of reading file line by line. See this for reference.\nAWK\nAWK, being a text processing utility, is quite appropriate for such task. It can do simple replacements and much more advanced ones based on regular expressions. It provides two functions: sub() and gsub(). The first one only replaces only the first occurrence, while the second - replaces occurrences in whole string. For instance, if we have string one potato two potato , this would be the result:\n$ echo \"one potato two potato\" | awk '{gsub(/potato/,\"banana\")}1'\none banana two banana\n\n$ echo \"one potato two potato\" | awk '{sub(/potato/,\"banana\")}1'                                      \none banana two potato \n\nAWK can take an input file as argument, so doing same things with input.txt , would be easy:\nawk '{sub(/blue/,\"azure\")}1' input.txt\n\nDepending on the version of AWK you have, it may or may not have in-place editing, hence the usual practice is save and replace new text. For instance something like this:\nawk '{sub(/blue/,\"azure\")}1' input.txt > temp.txt && mv temp.txt input.txt\n\nSED\nSed is a line editor. It also uses regular expressions, but for simple substitutions it's sufficient to do:\nsed 's/blue/azure/' input.txt\n\nWhat's good about this tool is that it has in-place editing, which you can enable with -i flag. \nPerl\nPerl is another tool which is often used for text processing, but it's a general purpose language, and is used in networking, system administration, desktop apps, and many other places. It borrowed a lot of concepts/features from other languages such as C,sed,awk, and others. Simple substitution can be done as so:\nperl -pe 's/blue/azure/' input.txt\n\nLike sed, perl also has the -i flag.\nPython\nThis language is very versatile and is also used in  a wide variety of applications. It has a lot of functions for working with strings, among which is replace(), so if you have variable like var=\"Hello World\" , you could do var.replace(\"Hello\",\"Good Morning\")\nSimple way to read file and replace string in it would be as so:\npython -c \"import sys;lines=sys.stdin.read();print lines.replace('blue','azure')\" < input.txt\n\nWith Python, however, you also need to output to new file , which you can also do from within the script itself. For instance, here's a simple one:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport tempfile\n\ntmp=tempfile.mkstemp()\n\nwith open(sys.argv[1]) as fd1, open(tmp[1],'w') as fd2:\n    for line in fd1:\n        line = line.replace('blue','azure')\n        fd2.write(line)\n\nos.rename(tmp[1],sys.argv[1])\n\nThis script is to be called with input.txt as command-line argument. The exact command to run python script with command-line argument would be\n $ ./myscript.py input.txt\n\nor\n$ python ./myscript.py input.txt\n\nOf course, make sure that ./myscript.py is in your current working directory and for the first way, ensure it is set executable with chmod +x ./myscript.py\nPython can also have regular expressions , in particular, there's re module, which has re.sub() function, which can be used for more advanced replacements.\n\nA: There are a number of different ways to do this. One is using sed and Regex. SED is a Stream Editor for filtering and transforming text. One example is as follows:\nmarco@imacs-suck: ~$ echo \"The slow brown unicorn jumped over the hyper sleeping dog\" > orly\nmarco@imacs-suck: ~$ sed s/slow/quick/ < orly > yarly\nmarco@imacs-suck: ~$ cat yarly\nThe quick brown unicorn jumped over the hyper sleeping dog\n\nAnother way which may make more sense than < strin and > strout is with pipes!\nmarco@imacs-suck: ~$ cat yarly | sed s/unicorn/fox/ | sed s/hyper/lazy/ > nowai\nmarco@imacs-suck: ~$ cat nowai \nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy sleeping dog\n\n\nA: You can use Vim in Ex mode:\nex -s -c '%s/OLD/NEW/g|x' file\n\n\n\n*\n\n*% select all lines\n\n*s substitute\n\n*g replace all instances in each line\n\n*x write if changes have been made (they have) and exit\n\nA: Through awk's gsub command,\nawk '{gsub(/pattern/,\"replacement\")}' file\n\nExample:\nawk '{gsub(/1/,\"0\");}' file\n\nIn the above example, all the 1's are replaced by 0's irrespective of the column where it located.\n\nIf you want to do a replacement on a specific column, then do like this,\nawk '{gsub(/pattern/,\"replacement\",column_number)}' file\n\nExample:\nawk '{gsub(/1/,\"0\",$1);}' file\n\nIt replaces 1 with 0 on the first column only.\nThrough Perl,\n$ echo 'foo' | perl -pe 's/foo/bar/g'\nbar\n\n\nA: You can do like this:\nlocate <part of filaname to locate> | xargs sed -i -e \"s/<Old text>/<new text>/g\" \n\nExamples:\nto replace all occurrences [logdir', ''] (without [] ) with [logdir', os.getcwd()] in all files that are result of locate command, do:\nex1:\nlocate tensorboard/program.py | xargs sed -i -e \"s/old_text/NewText/g\"\n\nex2:\nlocate tensorboard/program.py | xargs sed -i -e \"s/logdir', ''/logdir', os.getcwd()/g\"\n\nwhere [tensorboard/program.py] is file to search\n\nA: sed -i 's/original/new/g' file.txt\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*sed = Stream EDitor\n\n*-i = in-place (i.e. save back to the original file)\n\n*The command string:\n\n\n*\n\n*s = the substitute command\n\n*original = a regular expression describing the word to replace (or just the word itself)\n\n*new = the text to replace it with\n\n*g = global (i.e. replace all and not just the first occurrence)\n\n\n*file.txt = the file name \n\nA: sed is the stream editor, in that you can use | (pipe) to send standard streams (STDIN and STDOUT specifically) through sed and alter them programmatically on the fly, making it a handy tool in the Unix philosophy tradition; but can edit files directly, too, using the -i parameter mentioned below.\nConsider the following:\nsed -i -e 's/few/asd/g' hello.txt\n\ns/ is used to substitute the found expression few with asd:\n\nThe few, the brave.\n\nThe asd, the brave.\n\n/g stands for \"global\", meaning to do this for the whole line. If you leave off the /g (with s/few/asd/, there always needs to be three slashes no matter what) and few appears twice on the same line, only the first few is changed to asd:\n\nThe few men, the few women, the brave.\n\nThe asd men, the few women, the brave.\n\nThis is useful in some circumstances, like altering special characters at the beginnings of lines (for instance, replacing the greater-than symbols some people use to quote previous material in email threads with a horizontal tab while leaving a quoted algebraic inequality later in the line untouched), but in your example where you specify that anywhere few occurs it should be replaced, make sure you have that /g.\nThe following two options (flags) are combined into one, -ie:\n-i option is used to edit in place on the file hello.txt.\n-e option indicates the expression/command to run, in this case s/.\nNote: It's important that you use -i -e to search/replace. If you do -ie, you create a backup of every file with the letter 'e' appended.\n\nA: Finding and replacing across many files\nIn order to achieve as close to lightning speed or warp velocity as possible when doing find and replace across multiple files (maybe even thousands or millions) in massive filesystems such as huge code repos, I recommend using Ripgrep (rg) which is awesome and incredibly fast. Unfortunately, it doesn't support find and replace in files, and according to the author probably never will (update: definitely never will), so we have to use some work-arounds.\nRipgrep-based Method 1 (the easy, but more-limited 1-liner)\nHere is the first work-around: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/74#issuecomment-376659557\nUse Ripgrep (rg) to find files containing the matches, then pipe a list of those files to sed to do the text replacement in those files:\n# Replace `foo` with `bar` in all matching files in the current\n# directory and down\nrg 'foo' --files-with-matches | xargs sed -i 's|foo|bar|g'\n\nRipgrep-based Method 2 (my recommended choice)\nHere is the 2nd work-around: use my rgr (Ripgrep Replace) wrapper script I have written around Ripgrep which adds the -R option to replace contents on your disk. Installation is simple. Just follow the instructions at the top of that file. Usage is super simple too:\n# Replace `foo` with `bar` in all matching files in the current\n# directory and down\nrgr 'foo' -R bar\n\nSince it's a wrapper around rg, it also provides access to all of Ripgrep's other options and features. Here is the full help menu at this moment, with more usage examples:\nrgr ('rgr') version 0.1.0\n\nRipGrep Replace (rgr). This program is a wrapper around RipGrep ('rg') in order to allow some\nextra features, such as find and replace in-place in files. It doesn't rely on 'sed'. It uses\nRipGrep only. Since it's a wrapper around 'rg', it forwards all options to 'rg', so you can use it\nas a permanent replacement for 'rg' if you like.\n\nCurrently, the only significant new option added is '-R' or '--Replace', which is the same as\nRipGrep's '-r' except it MODIFIES THE FILES IN-PLACE ON YOUR FILESYSTEM! This is great! If you\nthink so too, go and star this project (link below).\n\nUSAGE (exact same as 'rg')\n    rgr [options] <regex> [paths...]\n\nOPTIONS\n    ALL OPTIONS ACCEPTED BY RIPGREP ('rg') ARE ALSO ACCEPTED BY THIS PROGRAM.

'-d' is not part of 'rg' but if you use either of these options here\n        it will auto-forward '--debug' to 'rg' under-the-hood.\n    -r <replacement_text>, --replace <replacement_text>\n        Do a dry-run to replace all matches of regular expression 'regex' with 'replacement_text'.\n        This only does the replacement in the stdout output; it does NOT modify your disk!\n    -R <replacement_text>, --Replace <replacement_text>\n        THIS IS THE ONE! Bingo! This is the sole purpose for the creation of this wrapper. This\n        option will actually replace all matches of regular expression 'regex' with\n        'replacement_text' ON YOUR DISK. It actually modifies your file system!

You will be fine.  \n\n4gb ram, 500gb disk, Pent D 3.2 ghz\n\nPretty enough to run windows or any other os  as Virtual Machine.\n\nA: \nAny reason not to do ubuntu host with xp guest? I know the xp vbox will run slower as a guest but really how much slower?\n\nVirtual Box is a good solution to have Windows available from Ubuntu in case you need it. As aneeshep already said, your system is more than sufficient to acchieve a fair performance. However a virtualized system of course is slower than a proper installation. Some 3D-Support is there but, depending also on your graphics card this may not be sufficient for a given application to run as purposed. This is especially true for gaming. Most Windows games won't run in a virtual machine. You need to test your applications on your individual system to find out if they perform well enough for you.\nAs a rule of thumb it may be wise to have the OS as your host where you spend most of the time in and have the guest for things you can't do with the host-OS. As there is not much you can't do with Windows (but also only few you can't do with Ubuntu!) you have to keep in mind that from perfomance and from security aspects you are far better off having Ubuntu as your primary OS than running on Windows XP.\nFor iTunes you need to know that even in the recent release of Virtual Box 4.0 burning audio CDs is not supported and fancy 3D-stuff like Coverflow may not work.\nOnce you have setup your system it is also a good idea to keep all of your data outside of the virtual disk to access them from both, host and guest using shared folders or by network acess.\n\nA: Yes, you could run a Virtual Machine and assign about 1GB of memory for it. You can use shared folders or even samba for your music collection.\n\nA: \nAny reason not to do ubuntu host with\n  xp guest? I know the xp vbox will run\n  slower as a guest but really how much\n  slower?\n\nI'm running exactly this configuration, with Ubuntu 10.10 as the host and Windows XP running in VirtualBox.  My hardware is a lower spec than your's - I've got 2GB RAM, 160GB disk and a Pentium M processor.  It all runs just fine, but I don't run games in the Windows XP image, so your mileage may vary.  I'm also running XUbuntu desktop instead of the default (Gnome or KDE) so that probably means I'm using fewer resources in the host.  I've assigned 512MB to the VM running Windows XP and it seems fine with that.\nI also agree with Takkat's answer - the host OS should be where you spend most of your time, in order to get the best performance.\n\nA: I would suggest keeping Ubuntu as the host OS. It sounds like your hardware should handle either scenario, but there are a couple benefits and drawbacks specific to this setup. First, the following would be benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keeping Windows XP in a VM allows you to easily migrate your installation over several installs and/or hardware configurations without triggering licensing problems\n\n*GDM allows you to log directly into a virtual machine (more info) without booting up a full desktop\n\n\nHowever, there are a couple drawbacks to this setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB support via Virtualbox can be problematic\n\n*3D acceleration may not be fast enough for newer applications that require a lot of horsepower\n\n\nDepending on what the benefits and the drawbacks mean to you, I'd say Ubuntu is an excellent choice for a host OS.\n\nA: My personal experience has been that while virtual box is fun for trying out systems and features there are headaches also. The solution that has worked out for me is to have an old xp computer as well as a newer linux machine connected to a kvm switch. \n\nA: Certain things just do not work on Linux, like certain Windows-centric electronics, certain games, iTunes, etc.. You can keep Windows on the first partition for the really difficult or impossible tasks that might come along without non-virtual Windows. Then, install Ubuntu and VirtualBox. Make a virtual Windows machine that does all the stuff it can do, like iTunes or what have you. Then you are covered for function and preference.\n\nA: To avoid the drawbacks above I would suggest a hybrid option (that's what I am running):\nmachine is dual boot Ubuntu / Windows and I have setup virtual box in Ubuntu to be able to run the Windows disk/partition as a VM (need to create multiple hardware profile in windows - native & VM). There are multiple godo sites out there explaining how to do that.\nThis allows you to be running ubuntu + windows at the same time, and if for some reason , you did not get enough horse power (playing game or something like need special windows for special hardware) you can easily switch to native hardware, without having to maintain 2 images of windows.\nDrawbacks: every time I switch back and forth I get the anoying windows registration, but I believe it can be disabled, I just haven't tried it\nOther drawback is when installing windows on native hardware first is it will set itself up to use IO APIC - meaning you have to use that option in your VM which is a performance hit for VirtualBox. Unfortunately virtualbox docs clearly indicate we can't disable IO APIC in windows once it is installed. I am not sure if you can work around it by installing the OS in VM first (without IO APIC) then boot it from disk (haven't tried it).\n", "Q: Installed Sun Java 6 - configuration problem when running as sudo I have install Sun Java 6 on an Ubuntu server and set an environment variable in the default profile as per the instructions at http://www.edugate.ie/workshop-guides/shibboleth-2-identity-provider-installation-linux-debian-or-ubuntu\nI then try to run an installer for a Java servlet - but when I run it as myself, it cannot create the required directory in /opt. When I run it as sudo, I am told that JAVA_HOME is not correct and it doesn't even start the installer - shouldn't this be coming from /etc/profile like it is for my normal user?\n\nA: instead of running it via sudo, run it in a root shell...\nsudo su\nthen check your environment variables and fix as necessary\necho $JAVA_HOME\nthen run the installer or set the variable if it needs setting\n\nA: Try this:\nexport JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/home\n\nexample:  \nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun\n\nThen run your applet like below:\nsudo env JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME your_applet_or_script\n\nexample:\nsudo env JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME /usr/bin/eclipse\n\nhope this helps.\n\nA: Very generally speaking (and just looking very briefly at those instructions you linked to), you want to run tomcat as a non-root user.  This is both safer & more convenient (since you don't have to do everything as root).  \nBut that also means tomcat will have to run on a higher port (e.g., 8080 or such). And in order to service client requests on the more common port 80, you run Apache on port 80 in front of Tomcat (which the instructions also outline), and Apache connects to tomcat via mod_jk on another port (e.g., 8009 (http) or 8443 (https) or such). \nNow, in order to install Java apps in Tomcat, just chown / chmod your tomcat directory so that your \"web user\" (possibly your own non-root user account) can write to it.  For example,\n $ sudo mkdir /opt/tomcat\n\nAnd then typically chown (or just chmod):\n $ sudo chown my_user:my_group /opt/tomcat\n\nNow, do everything as a non-root account, and no sudo is necessary. It might still be a good idea to have a semi-restricted \"web-admin\" account if this is a shared server, rather than using your own login.\n", "Q: Teamviewer in notification area only I was wondering if there was a simple way to close Teamviewer to the notification area like I would close Skype?\nEDIT:\nJust to clarify my initial post, I want to enable Teamviewer in the notification area so that I can close it in my open programs bar (click on x), and it would still be running in the notification area (Skype does that, I can option Banshee and Rhythmbox to do that, and Transmission does this too). All Tray puts it into the notification area, but the x still closes Teamviewer completely, and I have not found an optional setting in Teamviewer either.\nThanks for the answer though Karni! ;)\n\nA: Sure, you can use alltray for that :)\nLook it up in Applications -> Ubuntu Software Center, or use this command:\nsudo apt-get install alltray\n\nEDIT\nTo minimize the program, run alltray and point to the Window of it. It will hide in the tray. To hide/unhide to/from Tray, click the Tray icon of the program :)\n\nA: It's an application-specific behavior - you'd need to get the app makers to change it. However, moving it to another desktop will also cause it not to be an eyesore, while alltray as Karni suggested would fill the tray part.\n\nA: The option you might be looking for is called \"Close to tray menu\" and is available in Teamviewer's settings:\nExtras > Options > Advanced > \"Show advanced options\" > \"Close to tray menu\" check box.\nCheck this box to have Teamviewer 'minimize' to the notification area, after clicking the X (exit button).\nHope this helps :)\nEDIT:\nIf the \"Close to tray menu\" is grayed out, try the following solution:\nThe reason the \"Close To tray Menu\" is grayed out is because you have \"Start teamviewer with windows\". It's like a failsafe. Assuming you want Teamviewer to start everytime windows starts, then that means you never want it closed, therefore it greys out the Close To Tray.\nAll you have to do is change the setting for startup.\n\nA: I only have a license for Teamviewer 7. I therefore don't know if this solution applies to other versions. If you go to Extras > Options > Advanced on the pc you wish to control you can deactivate the ability to (especially by accident) close Teamviewer.\nThis works equally on Windows or Linux.\n", "Q: Has anyone got \"Creative Soundblaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 Pro\" - (usb Interface) installed?

It works out of the box (but I cannot test >2.0) in Ubuntu 10.10 (and it is working in Gentoo, Arch).

I'd like to know what I need to do to enable a user to modify values in /sys. As it's a sysfs, changing file permissions is not an option (and I don't like to do it on every boot).\n\nA: You need to use sudo.  If you only want to give them permission to modify a specific value without general sudo access, then you can write a script that updates that particular value, and configure your sudoers file to allow the user permission ONLY to run that script as root.\n\nA: You should clarify what do you want to obtain.\nMaybe you want to modify /etc/sysctl.conf, see man sysctl and man sysctl.conf\n\nA: I found a simple python/dbus/polkit example on the Ubuntuforums and changed the PolicyKit policy file defaults from\n<defaults>\n  <allow_any>auth_admin_keep</allow_any>\n  <allow_inactive>auth_admin_keep</allow_inactive>\n  <allow_active>auth_admin_keep</allow_active>\n</defaults>\n\nto\n<defaults>\n  <allow_any>no</allow_any>\n  <allow_inactive>no</allow_inactive>\n  <allow_active>yes</allow_active>\n</defaults>\n\nWith this change, an unprivileged user now can communicate with the service (running as root, thus being able to write to /sys) without having to type a password (possible risks?).\n", "Q: Compiz antialiasing with xserver-xorg-video-radeon?

Since it is default that no root password is used in Ubuntu, i wonder how i could revert this changes.\nOnce i have set a password for root, is there a method to disable it again?\n\nA: According to Ubuntu online help\n\nUbuntu developers made a conscientious\n  decision to disable the administrative\n  root account by default in all Ubuntu\n  installations. This does not mean that\n  the root account has been deleted or\n  that it may not be accessed. It merely\n  has been given a password which\n  matches no possible encrypted value,\n  therefore may not log in directly by\n  itself.\n\nIf you want to enable root account simply give it some password using\nsudo passwd\n\nWhen you enter this command you will be asked for new password. The password you enter will be the password for root account so be careful and choose a strong password.\nTo disable the root login use\nsudo passwd -l root\n\nThis will disable the login using root user name i.e your system will be back to previous state.\nIf you want more information on Ubuntu user management read the official documentation.\n\nA: sudo usermod -p '!' root\n\nThat will set the root account to have an unusable password.\nYou can also lock the account to stop people logging in.\nsudo passwd -l root\n\nEither approach should do what you want.

In order to run cron in the night at 4am, do I need to write 4 * * * *?\nAnd to run at 4pm o'clock, should it be 16 * * * *?\n\nA: No, that's not correct. The meaning of the fields \n* * * * *\nfor each asterisk slot respectively:\n\n\n*\n\n*minute (0 - 59) \n\n*hour (0 - 23)\n\n*day of month (1 - 31)\n\n*month (1 - 12)\n\n*day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7)\n\n\nSo for everyday 4am and 4pm you should use:\n0 4,16 * * *\n\nIf you leave a slot just as * it will mean every iteration of that time unit i.e. every hour, daily etc.\nHere, the part 0 4,16 means it will run at 0 minute of 4am and 4pm (i.e 4:00am and 4:00pm). If you wanted to run it at, let's say 15 minutes of 4am and 4pm instead you would change it to 15 4,16 * * * (i.e. 4:15am and 4:15pm).\n\nA: No. This would run at the 4th and 16th minute of every hour.\nYou're looking for:\n0 4,16 * * * command\n\nThat will run at both 4am and 4pm.\nOr if the two commands are different:\n0 4 * * * command\n0 16 * * * another_command\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The first column sets the minutes.

Prefarably from within the running system?\n\nA: I recommend against using dd.  It just does a dumb sector by sector copy, which means it will fail if the destination partition is smaller, and wastes a lot of time copying free space, and if the destination partition is larger, the additional space will not be available until you run resize2fs to expand the filesystem.\nIt is best to do this from a live CD because if you copy files while they are being modified, you will end up with corrupt results.  \nFormat the ssd and get both the new ssd partition and the original root partition mounted, then just run sudo cp -ax /media/old-partition/* /media/new-partition, where old-partition and new-partition are replaced with their actual mount points. That will copy every file over, preserving ownership, permissions, and timestamps.  \nThen run sudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/new-partition /dev/SSD_DEVICE, after substituting correct values for new-partition and SSD_DEVICE. That will install grub, making the disk bootable.\nOnce you reboot (making sure your bios is configured to boot from the ssd instead of the old drive ), make sure that you are running from the ssd and not from the old drive by checking the output of df and/or mount, and you should be good to blow away the old partition.\nOh, and you will want to edit the /etc/fstab file on the new partition after copying and updating the UUID of the root partition to match the UUID of the new SSD partition instead of the old one.  You can find that UUID by running sudo blkid.\nEdit: added /* in copy above, but needed edit to be more than 6 characters. Now it's 101 characters!\n\nA: This command:\ndd if=/dev/sdb1 of=DEVICE_PATH_OF_SSD_DRIVE\n\nshould work for cloning the / partition to the SSD drive. \nEDIT: this will only work if your partition is the same size as the drive. If they are not the same size, you can use partimage:\npartimage -z0 -d save /dev/sdb1 clone.partimg\npartimage restore DEVICE_PATH_OF_SSD_DRIVE clone.partimg\nrm clone.partimg\n\nA caveat to this method is that you need enough space on your drive for an image containing all of the contents of /. You should be fine if you have >10GB free. Otherwise, you may use -z1 instead of -z0 to compress the image. For even greater compression, use -z2. Also, partimage does not support the ext4 file system.\nOnce you have done that, you should then mount the SSD and check if your data has properly copied:\n$ mkdir /tmp/ssd\n$ sudo mount -t ext4 DEVICE_PATH_OF_SSD_DRIVE /tmp/ssd\n$ ls /tmp/ssd\nbin    dev   initrd.img      lost+found  opt   sbin     sys  var\nboot   etc   initrd.img.old  media       proc  selinux  tmp  vmlinuz\ncdrom  home  lib             mnt         root  srv      usr  vmlinuz.old\n\nReplace ext4 with the file system you have used for /.\nYou will probably need to install the GRUB bootloader on this drive:\nsudo grub-install DEVICE_PATH_OF_SSD_DRIVE\n\nYou will then need to edit your /etc/fstab file to replace /dev/sdb1 with the device path of your SSD drive in the entry that mounts to /. (sudo $EDITOR /etc/fstab)\nPlease wait until this answer has a few upvotes before following these instructions. I am not an expert at these things so I may have missed some vital information. Anyone who sees any flaws in this, please add a comment explaining them. You should take such precautions because if something goes wrong, it could leave your computer unbootable.\n\nA: Read first how to migrate, Is there an easy way to transfer an OS from one hard drive to another?.\nBoot from your SSD and add the following line to /etc/fstab (it's only a bind):\n/media/slowhd/home /home none rw,bind 0 0\n\nStart mount -a to make the changes active.\nTip: Do not mount /dev/yourhd /home because you loose the flexibility to move further directories to your old hd.\nA more technical solutions would be to use LVM (logical volume manager).\n", "Q: Would you recommend to install libcupsys2_1.3.9-17ubuntu3.9_all.deb?

But I have an idea which will work.\nUsing a Warren Falk's picfs fuse mount, you remount your Desktop under a hidden directory, say .VirtualBox/shared/Desktop and point virtual box at that. Then in the fuse mount configuration, you simply specify which files should be ignored.\nSee here for more details: http://www.warrenfalk.com/blog/2009/07/09/picsfs-fuse-filesystem/\nUsing this, your Desktop will be exactly the same to Linux, but your VirtualBox will see a controlled directory. The fuse code is even in python, so it's easy to modify. Let me know if you want instructions.\n", "Q: How can I get html code from the web with vala(gtk)?

I don't believe in Trash Bin and when I delete something I want it to be gone forever, how to turn off the Trash?\nP.S. When I delete files from the console do they also go to Trash?\n\nA: Hmmm.\nPlaces->Home Folder->Edit->Preferences->Behavior->Include a Delete command [...]\n\nYes, console deletes have no \"recycle\" action - they are gone.\n\nA: On my mp3 player I added a file called .Trash-1000 (not a directory), which just gets in the way.\nI hit Delete and get prompted: Cannot move file to rubbish, do you want to delete immeditately? with the default action Delete.\nGood enough for my needs.\n\nA: You can set the immutable bit.\nTo do so, first empty the trash:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*\n\nAnd then: \nsudo chattr +i ~/.local/share/Trash/\n\nAfter that, when you delete or move something to the trash, you'll get the following message: \nCannot move to trash, delete it immediately?\n\n\nEDIT: Actual results below\nchattr: Inappropriate ioctl for device while reading flags on /home/sg1/.local/share/Trash/\n\n\nA: I too am one of those who have been bugged by this problem for a number of years ... unsatisfied with the existing proposals, I've recently taken the time to investigate a solution myself.\nStarting with the premise that I want the Trash to be gone system-wide, I've found that -- for the time being -- the only real solution is to create a custom-compiled version of libgio (» GIO) which is modified to call g_file_delete() every time an application calls g_file_trash().\nFor all technology savvy users interested in this solution: I've just recently posted a step-by-step guide on GitHub:\nGlobally disable GNOME's Trash in Debian-based distributions\nI hope this is of (some) help to those who hate the Trash with the same passion as I do ...\n\nA: The answer by SirCrow with the immutable bit might be better, but here's another alternative solution.  In my case, I solved it with:\nsudo chown -R root:root ~/.local/share/Trash\n\nThis will change ownership of the location where the trashed files are typically stored to root, making the normal, non-root user unable to use the trash.  Of course, this assumes the current desktop user is not running as root, but typically that's not the case since it isn't recommended anyway.\nWhen the Trash directory is owned by root in this way, you'll see the message:\nCannot move file to the bin, do you want to delete it immediately?\n\nAs was answered before, anything deleted from Terminal/Console is gone for good -- No trash.\nTested in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\n\nA: You can use Shift+Delete instead of Delete to delete file(s) forever, but don't forget; If you delete the file forever, you can't easily get it back.\n\nA: You can add a delete action as described at\nHow to delete files bypassing trash .\nFiles deleted from the console are immediately removed, but please note that under some circumstances they can still be recovered, if you want to securely delete files use the \"wipe\" command.\n\nA: For the external drives, remove any /.Trash-$UID directories.\nFor the current drive, as for the workaround, you can set Bin to automatically empty (e.g. every hour). To do that, go to Activities and type File History & Trash (part of Settings). From there you can adjust the Rubbish Bin settings. You can also find the steps how to get into Rubbish settings in Ubuntu's Help.\n", "Q: Install applications on LiveCD/USB I'm running Ubuntu off a USB drive and I can't install it to the hard-drive yet. Is there a way for me to install more applications on the USB drive so that everytime I boot I can use them without re-installing?\n\nA: I can say that yes it is possible to run Ubuntu from a  usb in that fashion, but I would not suggest it.\nFlash drives have a set number of writes, hundred of thousands in some cases, and that sounds large but for an OS saving and reading files constantly, it wont take long before that pen drive reaches its limit.\nShort answer: yes, its possible and as an experiment interesting. As a permanent solution no.\n\nA: There is a way to have a portion of the usb disk dedicated to new files on the livecd desktop. When you make the live usb via the \"Startup Disk Creator\" you need to select \"Stored in reserved space\", I'm not sure if this only effects the docs and settings and not new apps, but it should.\nThe other easier and faster option is to use an installation on a USB stick instead of a livecd. You need a USB drive which is 4GB or more and when doing the install you need to select the usb drive as the target (use entire disk) and then at the end of the installation you need to select Advanced and put the usd drive in as the boot loader location. This is the only complexity for making a fully functional install on a stick.\n\nA: What you're talking about doing refers to having a persistent USB Drive. With what you currently are using yes, you can reboot it but no, you won't be able to save anything to it. An option have though is to make a LiveUSB that is able to be persistent, (Able to hold changes and save them, like saving a word document etc.) then you'd most likely be able to do what you're asking. To do this I recommend you use a USB Flash drive that has a minimum of 4GB of free memory, preferably 8GB if you have it. A (hopefully anyway) simple way to do this follows.\nPlease Note: This tutorial is based for those with Windows Systems, and are trying out GNU/Linux on the aforementioned system.\nWhat You Will Need\n\n\n*\n\n*The Universal USB Installer Program.\n\n*A computer with an Internet Connection.\n\n*A GNU/Linux ISO image. Ubuntu, Fedora, Kubuntu, Etc...\n\n\nWhat To Do\n\n\n*\n\n*DOWNLOAD or run the Universal USB Installer Program.\n\n*Browse and select your chosen GNU/Linux ISO Image. NOTE: If you don't have one you will be given the option to download it before writing it to your chosen drive.\n\n*Browse for and select your chosen USB Flash Drive.\n\n*MAKE SURE you have chosen the right flash/external drive BEFORE you write the ISO image to it as ALL data will be lost when this process is completed!!!\n\n*Write the ISO image to the flash drive, choosing if you wish to have a persistent storage and if so how much memory to allocate for said storage.\n\n*Restart your computer with the flash drive connected, boot to the flash drive, and enjoy your external USB Drive!\nHope this helps you! \n\n\nP.S. If you need more info please do not hesitate to let me know...\n\nA: If you have created the usb using the live usb creator or a similar tool no, they provide a semi-peristent option which allows to change /home contents but not the root filesystem.\nTo be able to update an USB install you will need to do a full persistent install as described at the answers for the following question:\nHow do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator)\n\nA: Using usb-creator.exe from the iso or Startup Disk Creator from the Live CD you can select \"Stored in reserved extra space\" and specify up to 4GB of persistence space.\nThis will allow you to install additional applications.\nYou may have a hard time installing proprietary drivers and some applications.\nAnd you should not do updates or upgrades with a persistent drive.\nIf you need these you can always do a full install to USB.\n", "Q: Concatenating several .mp3 files into one .mp3 As it was suggested here I am using cat command to concatenate several .mp3 files into one .mp3 file.\nImagine, I have following .mp3 files in the current folder:\n001001.mp3 001002.mp3 001003.mp3 001004.mp3 001005.mp3\n\nor, like this:\n096001.mp3 096002.mp3 096003.mp3 096004.mp3\n\nI need to concatenate these .mp3 files in there ascending sequence, i.e.  001001.mp3+001002.mp3+001003.mp3+etc.\nIn order to join these .mp3 files into one I am executing following command in the current folder:\ncat *.mp3 > final.mp3\n\nI tested the final .mp3 file and it is what I am expected, but I need to be sure that above command picks files in there ascending sequence.\nCan I be sure that above command always concatenates files in the ascending sequence?\nThank you Sir!\n\nA: As previously suggested, mp3wrap is a good solution. It may not work all of the time though. As far as I know, mp3wrap assumes that all the input files have the same characteristics such as VBR vs CBR, bitrate, and so on. If this assumption isn't met, it is likely to fail. In that case, the only solution would be to decode all the mp3files to a raw format like .wav, concatenate them with a program like sox and finish by re-encoding all to mp3.\n\nA: cat is not the right tool for this job. The MP3 format has all sorts of junk that can lurk at the front and end of the file and this needs to be strippe out. mp3wrap is what you want. It will exclude any metadata in the files and stick the audio together.\nsudo apt-get install mp3wrap\nmp3wrap output.mp3 *.mp3\n\nBefore you do that, run ls *.mp3 to check that they're in the correct order. When I originally wrote this answer (over six years ago!) wildcard globs apparently didn't behave well but I think they do now.\nYou might need to rename the files if for example, they are numbered but aren't zero-padded, {1-11}.mp3 would be sorted by 1 10 11 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. This can be fixed easily.\n\nA: Most people are suggesting mp3wrap, but it has downsides: the file generated does not report its full length in some players, and then you cannot seek past that point.\nmp3cat does the job fast and well, as far as I can tell. It can be downloaded in http://mulholland.xyz/dev/mp3cat/, and used as follows:\nmp3cat file1.mp3 file2.mp3 file3.mp3\n\nanother possibility would be sox\nsudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-mp3\nsox file1.mp3 file2.mp3 target.mp3\n\nbut it seems very slow (possibily it decodes and reencodes the audio?)\n\nA: It does an alphabetical sort based on single characters. That means that \"01\" comes before \"1\", since nought has a lower value than one.\nHere's an example. I've got a directory with files named 1, 2, 3, 04, 05, and 06. They are text files that contain their own file names:\ntest$ cat *\n04\n05\n06\n1\n2\n3\n\nSo, yes it will; but you need to make sure that all your files are 'padded' properly. \nThis nifty line of bash script will let you visually compare the file names, making it very easy to spot any mistakes:\nfor f in $(ls); do printf \"%05s\\n\" \"$f\"; done\n\nIt's output will look like this:\n   04\n   05\n   06\n    1\n    2\n    3\n\nIf they aren't, you will need to pad the file names: Bash script to pad file names on StackOverflow explains how to do it.\n\nEdit. Vote for Oli's answer, it's much better. :PI'll leave mine because it add something, but you should use his solution, \nmp3wrap output.mp3 `ls -1 *.mp3 | sort`\n\nKeep in mind that sort will still sort things in the way I described above, you will still need to pad file-names if they aren't equal in length.\n\nA: mp3wrap seems to be a decent enough solution, but when I played the resulting file, the timestamp wasn't correct. It seems like mp3wrap is best used when you're joining mp3s into a file that you know you'll want to split later.\nI simply wanted to permanently concatenate some mp3s together. I ended up using ffmpeg to concatenate the files:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, install ffmpeg\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 15.04+\nsudo apt install ffmpeg\n\n\n*Ubuntu 14.10 and below\nGo to http://ffmpeg.org/download.html, download one of the static builds, untar it, and copy to /usr/local/bin\n\n\n*ffmpeg -i \"concat:file1.mp3|file2.mp3\" -acodec copy output.mp3\nMore info:\nhttps://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate#protocol\nhttps://superuser.com/a/314245\n\nA: I found the online service audio-joiner to work very well and preserve the correct time-stamp (contrary to mp3wrap).\n\nA: perl -E'say qq(file '\\''$_'\\'') for <*>' *   > file.list   && ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file.list -c copy mybigfile.mp3\n\n\n*\n\n*copy this line into a terminal (where you have perl and ffmpeg available) after changing to the folder with all the files you want to concatenate\n\n*it will cause an error aboute \"file.list\" (because \"file.list\" will be written into the \"file.list\"-file) but nevermind, it still works\n\n*all in all this just writes the foldercontent into the \"file.list\"-file and formats it.\n\n*after that it will merge the files into one mp3 file with ffmpeg\n\nA: Let me summarize the other answers:\n\n*\n\n*mp3wrap joins mp3 files into a special \"concatenated mp3 file\" format, which is faster because it doesn't require re-encoding, but has the disadvantage of not being a normal mp3 file with a length and so on.\n\n\n*ffmpeg -i \"concat:file1.mp3|file2.mp3\" -acodec copy output.mp3 is cumbersome to type, but should work well, as it's a standard command to use for joining video files for example. However, in my testing it introduces glitches at the input file transitions.\n\n\n*sox file1.mp3 file2.mp3 target.mp3 should work great, certainly much easier to type, but it also introduces glitches in my testing.\n\n\n*Even when I use sox to first convert each .mp3 file to .wav, and then sox file1.wav file2.wav target.wav, the output contains audible glitches.\n\n\n*However, if I use mpg123 to decode the mp3 files to .wav, then I can join the .wav files with Sox and not hear glitches. This suggests that the problem with sox (and maybe ffmpeg) is in the decoding of the mp3 files.\n\n\n*mp3cat apparently works great but I was too lazy to test it, as it isn't found in my distribution's repository\nIt's curious that no one mentioned mpg123 yet. Although troubled by security and license issues early in its 20+ year history, it is one of the original mp3 players and should be fairly stable. Since it automatically concatenates its mp3 arguments (in a glitch-less fashion) before sending them to the sound card, we just have to use the -w option to tell it to output to a Wave file instead. Then lame encodes this back to mp3. Here's a script which accomplishes this:\n#!/bin/bash\nFILES=(\"$@\")\nOUTPUT=$(mktemp -t mp3-concat.XXXXXX.mp3 -u)\nWAVE=$(mktemp -t mp3-concat.XXXXXX.wav -u)\nmpg123 -w $WAVE ${FILES[@]}\nlame $WAVE $OUTPUT\ncat $OUTPUT\nrm $WAVE $OUTPUT\n\nUsage example:\n$ mp3-concat file1.mp3 file2.mp3 > joined.mp3\n\n\nA: I love bmaupin's comment, yet it could produce natural sort of (version) numbers by using sort -V:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -iname '*.mp3' -print0 | sort -Vz | xargs -0 mp3wrap ../tmp.mp3\n\nand you don't have to deal with special characters like ' \" () [] {} in the filename.\n", "Q: Is it okay to upload a binary 'source' archive to Launchpad for building? I have a package that is extremely complicated and uses libraries not included in any of the default repos.\nCan I upload a 'source' archive that contains the source and a pre-compiled binary? The build script would simply copy the binary to the package being built.\nIs this acceptable or will I run into trouble?\nNote: This is the project page.\n\nA: Launchpad's PPA terms of use don't explicitly prohibit a Debian \"source\" package that contains a pre-compiled binary. It does require the use of an acceptable license (i.e OSI Approved, FSF Approved, or DFSG Compliant). So as far as I can tell, the real question is whether the licences of the pre-compiled libraries allow you to distribute them without the corresponding sources.\nOf course, if you hope to have your package included in the proper Ubuntu archives this is prohibited. All packages in the archive must be build from source.\n\nA: No.  You need to package and upload the libraries first then.\n\nA: Technically there should be no problem, from a license point of view you may be violating LP's PPAs use policy, you would be distributing a binary without the corresponding source. \n", "Q: LibreOffice takes 30 seconds to start. OO started almost immediately Installed LibreOffice, no problems but when I click on LibreWriter it takes 30 seconds before it's ready to go. I played with Memory in Options, no improvement. I unchecked Java, no improvement.\n\nA: Only applicable to older versions (pre-6.x)\nTry using the systray quickstarter. Openoffice most likely is, and that is why it starts immediately.\n\n\nA: This is a known problem, at least on Arch Linux.\nThe problem is that LibreOffice tries to communicate with a WINS server (provided by Samba, I guess).

So with an old burned install CD of Feisty Fawn I went through the process of completely formatting the Windows OS and installing Ubuntu on an old XP laptop. I then went through the online upgrade to 10.4 LTS, only installing the gnome desktop environment package in the process.\nMy (admittedly very open) question is that in this state and online, what security considerations do I have to immediately make for the default install? I understand that a lot of this swings on my intended use of the server, but just sitting there online what risks is it exposed to (this obviously goes far beyond the realm of linux, but I am not sure how these risks are accommodated in the default install). For example, I believe there is a firewall installed with Ubuntu but by default it allows all traffic. \nAny other guidelines would be much appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: The Community Documentation's security chapter is a good starting point. For a server you should read the security chapter in the server guide, too\n\nA: You should feel secure, at least for the time being, because there are no services running by default. In addition, if you have a router between your ISP router and your computer, then your network is probably using private addressing, anyway, like 192.168.something. (And that router would need a specific instruction to forward certain packets from your public address to your private address.) There's plenty of time for Florian's first comment.\n\nA: As you say it does depend on exactly what you will use this for, but usual practice is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Understand what services you want?\nHTTP? SSL? SMTP? Ensure all others\nare disabled/removed\n\n*Use some form of filtering to allow\nonly those services, and you reduce\nthe potential threat footprint (in\ncase malicious or accidental services\nexist on the server)\n\n\nDepending on your threat, you may want to run the initial install behind a firewall which only allows outbound connections. This is what I would recommend for any install which may need to download updates - it helps to remove the threat of compromise before updates and patches are implemented.\n\nA: None.\nThere is no firewall needed for a default Ubuntu system because there are no insecure services listening by default.\n", "Q: How can I find the location (on the desktop) of a window on the command line? I'm trying to write a little script to help manage my windows via keyboard shortcuts.\nIn order to do what I want, I need to be able to find the current location and size of the \"active\" (focused) window.   By location, I mean the X,Y coordinates of the window on the desktop, and by size I mean the height and width of the window.\nIs there a command line utility that can fetch this information?\n\nA: With \"xdotool\" you can easily interact with windows using keyboard or mouse events.\nExample of sending a CtrlC sequence to the active window:\nxdotool getwindowfocus key ctrl+c # Sends CTRL+C to the current window.\n\nIf you really need the window position:\neval $(xdotool getmouselocation --shell); echo $X $Y\n\nFor more actions/options check the man page.\n\nA: You can get all the info for the current active window by using this command:\nxwininfo -id $(xprop -root | awk '/_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW\\(WINDOW\\)/{print $NF}')\n\nor\nxwininfo -id $(xdpyinfo | grep focus | grep -E -o 0x[0-9a-f]+)\n\nJust parse the output for the co-ordinates you need.

I have installed wubi on one of my NTFS partions, I chose this one, because it had the most free space, but for some reason wubi does not mount it automatically, can I mount it manually?\n\nA: The windows fs is already mounted since it contains the loopback file you use as the root fs.  You should be able to see it under /host if I am understanding this initramfs script correctly.\n\nA: I'm a bit confused by your question. Wubi uses a loop file to store the Ubuntu install. You will be able to mount the loop file from Windows as long the filesystem in Ubuntu is ext3, ext4 might be more of a problem.\nPlease see the following forum post for more info:- \nhttp://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=27392\nIf Wubi cannot access the loop file, it may be because there is a file system error on the NTFS partition which needs to be addressed first.\nMore info needed.\n", "Q: bootable USB / installation requirements Originally asked on One Hundred Paper Cuts Answers thread\n\nOn the official site:\n  http://www.ubuntu.com/netbook/get-ubuntu/download\nThe instructions for creating a\n  bootable USB key for installing Ubuntu\n  Netbook Remix include a line saying:\n\"Insert a USB stick with at least 2GB\n  of free space\"\nI recently installed UNR on a netbook\n  -- in fact, the one I'm using right now -- and I went ahead despite only\n  having a 1GB USB key on hand.\n  Everything went smoothly and installed\n  100% correctly.\nIf I had waited to go out and buy a\n  2GB USB key I would have spent that\n  money unnecessarily and wouldn't have\n  been able to use the computer in the\n  meantime.\nI was wondering if there's a specific\n  rationale for requiring a 2GB USB key,\n  or if the instructions could be\n  changed to indicate that it can be\n  done with only 1GB.\nThanks!\n\n\nA: The specific requirements for a 2GB stick is so you can install a persistent file to the USB disk so that if you require a certain package on the LiveUSB, you will have more than enough space.\nThe persistent filesystem for the disk requires at least (from the experiences I've had) 500MB to efficiently operate (see the below section titled \"EDIT\" for details on this number).  That is the reason for the 2GB USB stick requirement.\nEDIT\nThe source for this information was testing I've done in the past.  I have 1GB, 2GB, and 8GB sticks here, and making the bootable USB disc through the USB Startup Creator tool in 10.04, the persistent filesystem does not effectively operate at the 1GB level, works fairly well at the 2GB level, and works great at the 8GB level.\n\nA: I think they have the 2gig thing for if you are not only installing Ubuntu on a computer but to use it on other computers just temporarily. The 2gig could be a minimum recommendation for saving files to the flash drive. \n\nA: The UNR iso is under 700 meg so I would imagine it will fit on a 1GB stick, but don't quote me on that ;)\nI seem to remember using a black 1GB stick I have for doing same with an older version of UNR, but of course requirements may have changed since then.\nI would recommend trying it.

Why does Ubuntu 10.10 amd64 (Maverick Meerkat) not address more of 3 GB RAM?\nMy machine is a Toshiba P205-S6287 Intel Centrino Duo 64 bits processor and 4 GB RAM at 667 MHz.\nAccording to the detailed specifications, the notebook runs a 64-bit Core 2 Duo T5300 processor and has a 945GM Express chipset. \n\nA: This is due to the Mobile Intel 945GM Express in your laptop.\nI own a Thinkpad T60, which uses the same chipset. It was one of the first northbridges from intel for the Core2Duo 64-bit CPUs. They failed in designing it.\nThe chipset can only theoretically address 4GB of RAM, yet also has to address other hardware (I/O memory). It reserves the upper 1GB memory range for that. The 64bit logical memory address support in the Linux kernel doesn't help, because the mainboard and northbridge only provide for a 32bit physical address bus to the CPU. And there is no workaround.\nhttp://forums.lenovo.com/t5/T61-and-prior-T-series-ThinkPad/Thinkpad-s-and-N100-s-w-945PM-chipset-can-t-address-gt-3G-Ram/m-p/2730\n\nThere is a theoretical option in devising memory bank switching. Yet the kernel does not support it, nor would it make sense on the x86 architecture. The i810 memory controller of the 945GM is probably too lazy for that to make sense. \n\n\nA: There are several possible reasons.\nOne is that you are, in fact, not running the amd64 build. Another is that your motherboard and/or BIOS are broken and not reporting the correct amount of RAM.\nAnother is that you have video memory and other hardware resources taking up space in the 3-4 GB area of memory, and your motherboard/BIOS is incapable of hoisting the shadowed RAM to higher addresses so that it can be accessed.\nFiguring out which requires looking at your dmesg output.\n\nA: My short answer is: likely because the BIOS designer was sloppy. \nThe long anwser is:\nAlthough you have 4GB RAM installed, you can not expect to have 4GB of usable RAM available with the Intel 945GM chipset. This is a chipset limitation. You can tell this from the chipset's specification:\nhttp://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intelligent-systems/navy-pier/mobile-945-express-chipset-datasheet.html\nQuote from section 9.2: \"The Memory Controller Hubs provides a maximum DRAM address decode space of 4 GB. The MCH does not remap APIC or PCI Express memory space. This means that as the amount of physical memory populated in the system reaches 4 GB, there will be physical memory \nthat exists yet is non-addressable and therefore unusable by the system.\"\nThe BIOS must reserve address ranges for several resources, i.e. the BIOS itself, PCI and PCI Express memory mapped space, internal graphics, APIC memory space and other memory windows for I/O access. All these address ranges have to lie within the 4GB address space and as such occupy address ranges that are not available to system memory any longer. You could say these resources \"steal\" physical RAM memory space.\nThat being said, if you have 4GB installed you can expect to have more than 3GB system memory available.\nThe amount of physical memory that is available to the system depends on how much effort the BIOS designer puts into arranging theses address ranges. For example, the BIOS could allocate the least amount needed for each resource. Or it could allow for disabling or limiting address allocation for PCI Express depending on your system's usage of PCI Express devices. \nThe BIOS designer of your system likely set the upper limit of usable RAM to a static maximum of 3GB even though you installed 4GB. This approach provides a static address window of 1GB to the BIOS designer and as such simplifies the BIOS designers task to allocate address ranges for the resources so they do not conflict with any other address range.\n\nA: psusi is right. \nI have the same situation here:\nAlthough they call it \"64-bit CPU\" you can often not address 4 GB+ memory.\nMost old motherboard do only have 32 bit for the addresses and from this pool the graphics card needs to get their addresses too.\n= 4 GB - graphics card memory (1 GB) = 3 GB.\nI fear there is no possibility to fix this by patching or upgrading firmware of anything.\nIf you are interested in detail I recommend: Physical Address Extension\n", "Q: How to automount hard disks without the need for password at login?

I've been experimenting with s3ql on Ubuntu 10.04, using it to mount Amazon S3 buckets.  However, I'd really like it to mount them automatically.  Does anyone know how to do that?\n\nSolution:\nThanks to help from Nikratio of s3ql I'm finally able to mount S3 buckets automatically when the system boots. You'll definitely want to look at the manual, but here's the basics of how to do it!\nThe first step is to create an authinfo file.  This file should be placed in a .s3ql directory within the home directory of the user who will be using it.  The authinfo file contains login info allowing s3ql to mount buckets without prompting.  Below is an example of what your authinfo file should look like.  The first line contains your Amazon Security Credentials.  The second contains the location and password for your bucket.  You can add multiple bucket-lines to this file if needed, but I'm only using one in this example.  At this point, the bucket password can be anything.\nbackend s3 machine any login YourAWSAccessKeyID password YourAWSSecretAccessKey\nstorage-url s3://mybucket password EncryptionPasswordOfYourChoosing\n\nThe encryption_password_of_your_choosing is used by S3QL to encrypt/decrypt all file writes/reads from S3.\nThe bucket name has to be unique across all of AWS: no two users can have the same bucket name, so its a good idea to log into Amazon Web Services and try different names until you find one that's available. One good naming scheme is to use the name of the domain+server you'll be accessing the bucket from (i.e. \"staging.example.com\" or \"east.coast.01.example.com\", or whatever is appropriate).\nTo create the file system, use the command:\nmkfs.s3ql s3://mybucket\n\nIt will prompt you for your encryption password.  This should be the same as the bucket password in the authinfo file.\nNow that your file system is created, you can mount it using the command:\nmount.s3ql s3://mybucket /mnt/s3/bucket\n\nOf course, your bucket name and mount point will vary.\nNow, if we want to mount this bucket automatically on boot, we need to add an upstart script to /etc/init.  Fortunately, s3ql comes packaged with one, s3ql.conf.\nI added \"--allow-other\" to the mount.s3ql command to allow users other than root to access the mounted bucket.\n#\n# This file can be placed in /etc/init. It defines an upstart job that\n# takes care of mounting and unmounting an S3QL file system.\n# \ndescription \"S3QL Backup File System\"\nauthor      \"Nikolaus Rath <Nikolaus@rath.org>\"\n\nstart on (filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=eth0)\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nenv BUCKET=\"s3://mybucket\"\nenv MOUNTPOINT=\"/mnt/s3/bucket\"\n\nexpect stop\n\nscript\n    # Redirect stdout and stderr into the system log\n    DIR=$(mktemp -d)\n    mkfifo \"$DIR/LOG_FIFO\"\n    logger -t s3ql -p local0.info < \"$DIR/LOG_FIFO\" &\n    exec > \"$DIR/LOG_FIFO\"\n    exec 2>&1\n    rm -rf \"$DIR\"\n\n    # Check and mount file system\n    fsck.s3ql --batch \"$BUCKET\"\n    exec mount.s3ql --upstart --allow-other \"$BUCKET\" \"$MOUNTPOINT\"\nend script\n\npre-stop script\n    umount.s3ql \"$MOUNTPOINT\"\nend script\n\nAfter adding this script, in theory you should be able to reboot and have your bucket automatically mounted, but this is were I ran into trouble.  Mine wasn't being mounted.\nMy problem was caused by the fact that upstart was running the script as root, but I'd created the file system as another user.  Once I copied the .s3ql directory from the home directory of the user I'd been logged-in as to /root, the problem was solved.\nI hope this helps someone else out there.  Although I haven't been using my mounted S3 bucket for long, I'm impressed with how my initial tests have gone.\nAlso, this answer was written about a week after the solution was found.  I think I've covered everything, but if you find I've missed a step, let me know and I'll add it.  You'll also want to read the manual, its really worth reading if you intend to use s3ql.\n\nA: As I have not found a solution to this question using systemd (Ubuntu 20.04, s3ql 3.8.0) easily I will post my solution here:\n[Unit]\nDescription=mount s3ql filesystem\nWants=network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nType=notify\nNotifyAccess=all\nExecStart=mount.s3ql --systemd --fg <other options> <storage url> <mount point>\nExecStop=umount.s3ql <mount point>\nTimeoutStopSec=5min\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nFor very large filesystems it might be necessary to increase TimeoutStopSec or set it to infinity (which I personal wanted to avoid).\nAdd this to the correct systemd dir (e.g. /lib/systemd/system/s3ql.service) and systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl start s3ql (while the fs is unmounted and uncorrupted).\n\nA: Modern Ubuntu installations use the event driven upstart system for much of the boot up process, so you're best to move the start up to that. You'd have a script in /etc/init that would look something like this:\ndescription     \"S3FS\"\n\nstart on (filesystem\n        and net-device-up IFACE!=lo)\nstop on runlevel[!2345]\n\nconsole output\nexpect fork\nrespawn\n\nscript\n    # Redirect stdout and stderr into the system log\n    DIR=$(mktemp -d)\n    mkfifo \"$DIR/LOG_FIFO\"\n    logger -t s3ql -p local0.info < \"$DIR/LOG_FIFO\" &\n    exec > \"$DIR/LOG_FIFO\"\n    exec 2>&1\n    rm -rf \"$DIR\"\n\n    modprobe fuse\n    fsck.s3ql --batch s3://mybucket\n    exec mount.s3ql --allow-other s3://mybucket /mnt/s3fs\nend script\n\nYou'll have to do some testing work — I don't know how the output redirection for logging will behave, and you may need to set up a post-stop script to properly unmount\nthe file system.\nThe upstart documentation is here. I haven't found a FUSE based package that uses it, yet, but I didn't do an exhaustive search. \nAn alternative may be to construct an fstab entry for the file system, so as to leave the mountall entries to take care of mounting it for you, but I don't know if there is a way to specify that a given FUSE file system is network dependent.\n\nA: With some help from Nikratio, I'm finally able to mount my S3 bucket automatically on boot.

To enable IP forwrding, someone can use the command:\necho 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nExecuting this command will give permission denied as it requires root privileges. However, executing the same command with sudo gives also permission denied error! It seems that output redirect > does not inherit the permissions of the preceding command echo. Is this right?\nAs a workaround I do:\necho 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nIs this the best way to do it? Am I missing something?\nPlease, note that this is an example and it applies to all commands that use output redirect.\n\nA: One solution is to use : \nsudo bash -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward'\n\nbut this one doesn't inherit env properties from the parent shell, so you can't use it for example with echo $PATH to get the same result you'd have in your parent shell (of course only in case you alter your path property) . \nUsing sudo -E will preserve the environment variables.\nAlso, according to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh, you'd be better off using sh (which is a symlink to dash), instead of invoking this with bash.\nSo, you might rewrite this as :\nsudo -E sh -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward'\n\n\nA: I usually use the sudo bash -c trick, or just do sudo -s first to stay root, then run the redirection command.\nThe reason it doesn't work the first way is that the shell processes the redirection first, then runs sudo.  Since your shell doesn't have access to the file, the redirection fails.\n\nA: Your approach with sudo tee is fine. A nice consequence of using sudo tee is that the executed command before the pipe will not run as root. That's useful if you just need the output of a program, which does not require root privileges.\nIf you don't care about the output of the program used before the pipe (echo 1 in this case), redirect stdout to /dev/null:\necho 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward > /dev/null\n\nThe above is equivalent to sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward' with the difference that echo 1 is run as root.\nIf you need to append to a privileged file, you can either use sh -c 'echo 127.0.0.1 local.host >> /etc/hosts' or:\necho 127.0.0.1 local.host | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts\n\nNote the -a which is shorthand for --append.\n", "Q: How to configure TV and video recording and pausing?

A simple question about rsnapshot.\nIn order to perform daily backups I'm going to add lines to cron in my Ubuntu.\nThen, why do I have also these lines in the rsnapshot.conf ?\n#########################################\n#           BACKUP INTERVALS            #\n# Must be unique and in ascending order #\n# i.e. hourly, daily, weekly, etc.      #\n#########################################\n\ninterval        hourly  6\ninterval        daily   7\ninterval        weekly  4\n#interval       monthly 3\n\nIf I use cron, should I disable them ?\nthanks\nps. I've just realized that in the crontab I still have \"hourly\" and \"daily\". Should I then uncomment only the one I use in the crontab ? And what's the point to specify hourly if it is already specified in cron ? I'm a bit confused.\n# crontab -e\n0 */4 * * * /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot hourly\n30 23 * * * /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily\n\n\nA: No, you shouldn't disable them.\nThe interval config tells rsnapshot \n\n\n*\n\n*how many snapshots of each level to keep. In your example, after 6 \"hourly\" snapshots the oldest \"hourly\" is deleted.\n\n*where to get the contents of the current snapshot. The top entry (in your case \"hourly\") is copied from the source, while the remaining entries simply link to the latest snapshot from one level above.\n\n\nThe interval labels like \"daily\" and \"weekly\" don't mean anything (you could call them \"x\" and \"y\" if you wanted), but they must match the argument you pass in to rsnapshot when you call it.\nIn short, you need both - the interval config to tell rsnapshot how the different intervals relate, and the cron to execute it.\n\nA: \nIf you decide not to use the hourly interval for example, then just leave the interval >line in your configuration, but don't run an cron job that specifies \"hourly\".\n\nThis isn't quite right, at least not with the current version of rsnapshot.\nThe first \"retain\" line in rsnapshot.conf (e.g. 'hourly') tells which name to copy the current backup to.  The rest rotate.  From the man page:\n\nBackup levels must be specified in the config file in order, from most frequent to\n  least frequent. The first entry is the one which will be synced with the backup points. \n  The subsequent backup levels (e.g., daily, weekly, etc) simply rotate, with each higher \n  backup level pulling from the one below it for its .0 directory.\n\nSo, if you're not going to ever call rsnapshot hourly, your rsnapshot.conf shouldn't have a retain hourly line.\n\nA: Your crontab job will call the relevant type of rsnapshot job to run.  If you run rsnapshot hourly you will create a directory in your output directory called \"hourly.0\".  Run it again, it will create \"hourly.1\".\nSo for every item you enable in your crontab, there should be a corresponding interval line in your /etc/rsnapshot file.  If you decide not to use the hourly interval for example, then just leave the interval line in your configuration, but don't run an cron job that specifies \"hourly\".\nThe confusion only arises because the default names are \"hourly\" \"daily\" and so on.  These are simply labels that can be changed to suit your needs.\nFor my rsnapshot, I use \"daysago\", \"weeksago\" and \"monthsago\" :\n\n\nA: The \"interval\" directive actually replaces the \"retain\" in the previous versions. Yes, confusing, I know, but j-g-faustus explains it very clearly.\n", "Q: What does snapshot_root do? I want to use rsnapshot for remote backups of my websites.\nIt is not clear this line in rsnapshot.conf:\nsnapshot_root   /.snapshots/\n\nIn the documentation, it says snapshots are stored in this directory, but I actually want them to be stored on a remote server and this is specified later with the line \nbackup local_folder remote_server\n\nso what's snapshot_root then ?\n\nA: snapshot_root is the root for the paths you specify under backup.\nFor example:\nsnapshot_root  /var/backups/me/\n...\nbackup /home/me/movies/ /media/\nbackup /home/me/music/  /media/\nbackup /home/me/drafts/ /documents/\n\nAfter running rsnapshot hourly, for example, the snapshots would be stored under\n/var/backups/me/hourly.0/media\n/var/backups/me/hourly.0/documents\n\nThe snapshot target must be a local filesystem (although the source can be remote).\nI think the simplest option is to put the rsnapshot service on the remote server, and let it copy from your webserver. Using ssh, it would look something like\nsnapshot_root  /var/backups/me/\n...\nbackup me@example.com:/home/me/movies/ /media/\n\nYou would need to have the ssh daemon running on the \"example.com\" box, and configured so that the user (here \"me\") can ssh into \"example.com\" without being asked for a password.\nSee the rsnapshot HOWTO (section 4.3.8 Backup) for more details.\n\nA: I had the same issue... and discovered that if I locally mount a folder from the remote system, then rsnapshot will allow me to set the \"snapshot_root\" configuration parameter to point to it.\nThis then allows me to store my snapshots and my backup on the same remote server.\neg.\nMount a folder from the remote system\nmount 192.168.0.2:/volume1/Backup /mnt/Backup\nSet the \"snapshot_root\" configuration parameter to point the mounted folder\nsnapshot_root   /mnt/Backup/rsnapshot/\nSet a rsnapshot backup point to backup a local folder remotely\nbackup  /home/backup-source user@192.168.0.2:/volume1/Backup/backup-target/ rsync_short_args=-trvsz\nNote: Although I could have simply designated the mounted remote folder instead as a backup destination, (see below), this would not have enabled me to utilise the Rsync server running on the remote target, (in this case a Synology NAS).

What steps? I am about to move to a new Lenovo X201 from current X61. Current setup has separate \\home, separate swap file, also separate \\Data partition. Am currently running 10.04 32 bit. Am considering running 64 bit on new machine because I will now have 8 GB of RAM. And would like to also move to 10.10.\nIdeally I would like preserve as much of my current setup as possible...\nNew machine has Win7 on it, but will blow that away, as I've made a clonezilla copy of it, and will use VirtualBox for when I need Windows.\nCan someone suggest a good step by step for me? I'm networked to a NAS and also have plenty of external USB storage in case I need intermediary steps.\nSo do I set up new machine first with 64bit 10.10, with partition scheme I want? then rsnyc over \\home from old machine (over write target home)?\nDo I need to upgrade the X61 first to 10.10?\n\nA: Yes, rsync is a good way to copy your files to the new computer.  If you want the same set of packages installed, you might also want to run synaptic and File -> Generate Package Download script on the old machine, and load it into the new machine.\n\nA: Given that plenty of space is available, use a live system (usb stick) to create a tar archive of each of the two partitions you want to migrate - home and data - and store them on the NAS or the external disk. Install Ubuntu the normal way, creating the relevant partitions. Then untar the archive on the new computer, possibly from a live system. That way you can be sure that the permissions, special files etc. are preserved. This page gives a sample tar command line.\nYou should be able to reuse the old home partition as is; any incompatibility would be the result of a bug. Discard the root partition, which holds /usr etc. The configuration files in your home partition should be agnostic as to 32bit or 64bit.\nIf your old user had User ID 1001 and your new user ID 1000, you need to change the permissions of the files in your /home.\n", "Q: VNC client not working -- Not able to see the changes happening on the other side Here is the Problem: I have two computers connected in the same LAN.\nI am trying to access one computer from another using Remote Desktop Viewer, I am able to see the remote desktop.\nBut when i click on any thing or perform any action, I dont see the result but the action is performed on the remote desktop..But it is not refreshed on the remote desktop screen..\nFor Ex:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opened Remote Desktop viewer\n\n*Connected to the other computer which has yahoo home page opened\n\n*Clicked on the close button of the web page\n\n*Action is performed on the other computer (Yahoo page is closed).\n\n*On Remote Desktop screen i still see the Yahoo home page\n\n*Whatever action i perform on remote desktop screen i see the same screen(In this case yahoo home page)\n\n\nBottom line: Whatever screen i see on the start up of Remote Desktop viewer that is not getting refreshed.\nSo the thing is though i am able to perform actions on remote desktop, the screen is not refreshing..\nHow do i solve this?\nI hope i made my point clear..\nNOTE: I am connecting to Ubuntu 9.04 machine from Ubuntu 10.04LTS..

If this is the case, you can't use the built-in VNC server that comes with Ubuntu by default.  Instead, you have to use the x11vnc package (or something similar) that supports the \"noxdamage\" option.\nSee this question/answer for further details on how to set this up :\nVNC doesn't work with compiz\n\nA: I'm not a huge VNC expert, but I noticed when I set up VNC recently that it does not connect to my main desktop instance by default, but spawns a new instance.

I mean, i use renoise, and, since i dont have the need for low latencies, do i really need to use it?\nMy basic setup ( or workflow ) is that i use csound to render stuff to wav, then import it as a sample in renoise. That goes with field recordings, my own samples, etc. So, i dont need ultra low latencies, and i dont need to patch \"cords\", but i want to use dssi plugins, and dssi-vst. What would be something of a minimum requirements of apps that should work. \nCan renoise load dssi-vst plugins by itself or do i need to use jack to patch thru or something third, i tried to read lot of articles but i got lost in the different setups... \n\nA: I wouldn't think that it does particularly need JACK (LMMS can work fine with just ALSA until you add MIDI input) but using audio programs without it can be a real pain in the arse. Having your audio come through the painful latencies that Pulseaudio gives it can delay your sound for as much as three seconds. And there are programs that do that because they use the regular ALSA/PA soundserver! It can be a pain to maintain and manage but once there is better integration with PA/ALSA then it will hopefully become way easier to work with.\n", "Q: How can I specify a dependency between 2 versions of a package?

I have been running UbuntuOne sync on a new PC to a new UbuntuOne account for over 14 hours.  My UbuntuOne account capacity stills show 0% used and lists only folder names.  All the while, my UbuntuOne preferences indicate that sync is running.\nAny ideas???\n\nA: Please read “How can I tell whether Ubuntu One file sync is working, and what progress it is making?”.\nFolders are the first thing created, and it's entirely possible the syncdaemon is chugging along doing its thing. You haven't mentioned what version of Ubuntu you're on, so I don't know what performance to expect from your client (it's improved drastically with each release).\nHow many files and folders are you trying to upload, and what's the total size? If you have a lot (tens of thousands) of small files, you might be experiencing the worst performance problem we have right now (we are fixing it for 11.04). If you have very large files that don't finish uploading between network glitches or hiccups (such as suspending your machine), it might be stuck reuploading the same file over and over; this is another issue we're fixing for 11.04.\nIf it turns out that progress isn't happening (and the above article doesn't get you to nudge it in the right direction), try first quitting, restarting and connecting the syncdaemon. The way to do that will work across all versions of Ubuntu right now is by entering the following in a terminal:\nu1sdtool --quit\nu1sdtool --start\nwhile ! u1sdtool -c >&/dev/null; do sleep 30; done\n\nthis should be enough to “unstick” the syncdaemon from whatever got it into trouble, and set it on its way. Use what you learned in the other article to track progress, and restart it if it seems stuck for too long.\n\nA: I use ubuntu 11.04. I have a 540 MB backup file to upload to my Ubuntu One. I've been experiencing the same thing. The same file is being synced now for the x times. So I figured that Ubuntu One is quite conservative in using my bandwidth. I edited my upload settings to just let 'er rip. I unticked the 'limit the upload speed' box. The upload finished quietly with an OSD notification. I checked the Ubuntu One web interface just to be sure.\nIf you have a limited bandwidth you might want to tick the 'limit upload speed' again. \n", "Q: Mouse and keyboard slow to recognize with KVM switch I recently started using a KVM switch, so that I can share my usb mouse and keyboard between my linux and windows notebooks, when working at my desk.  My windows machine handles the switch seamlessly, whereas my ubuntu system takes 5-10 seconds to re-recognize the mouse and keyboard.\nIs there some way I can speed this up?\n\nA: Somewhat on a different track, but possibly a good solution for your problem, is Synergy.

Right, no kidding now ... A mate last night asked me if it is possible to erase the ghost of a section of his hard drive (set the unused section of the hard drive to '0').

If you try\nusing u1sdtool during that time, you can easily trigger the above\nDBus error. It's ugly, and we're working to make it go away for 11.04,\nbut it's also innocuous.

This depends on the one hand on the amount of folders/files that you've chosen to synchronize (I think the filesize plays less of a role), and on the other side, is a U1-related issue that they intend to fix in the release of the next version of Ubuntu (Natty Narwhal, which I wouldn't recommend installing of you say you're not techsavy ;), I know I didn't (yet)).\nI'd recommend however to install ubuntuone-indicator and magicada.

UPDATE (see end of question)  \nThe text \"search and replace\" utility programs I've seen, seem to only search on a line-by-line basis...  \nIs there a command-line tool which can locate one block of lines (in a text file), and replace it with another block of lines.? \nFor example: Does the test file  file contain this exact group of lines: \n'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,  \nAnd the mome raths outgrabe. \n\n'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\nBeware the Jubjub bird, and shun\nThe frumious Bandersnatch!'\n\nI want this, so that I can replace multiple lines of text in a file and know I'm not overwriting the wrong lines.   \nI would never replace \"The Jabberwocky\" (Lewis Carroll), but it makes a novel example :)\nUPDATE:\n..(sub-update) My following comment about reasons when not use sed are only in the context of; don't push any tool too far beyond its design intent (I use sed quite often, and consider it to be invaluable.)  \nI just now found an interesting web page about sed and when not to use it.\nSo, because of all the sed answers, I\"ll post the link.. it is part of the sed FAQ on sourceforge \nAlso, I'm pretty sure there is some way diff can do the job of locating the block of text (once it's located, the replacement is quite straight foward; using head and tail) ... 'diff' dumps all the necessary data, but I haven't yet worked out how to filter it , ... (I'm still working on it)  \n\nA: This simple python script should do the task:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n# Syntax: multiline-replace.py input.txt search.txt replacement.txt\n\nimport sys\n\ninp = open(sys.argv[1]).read()\nneedle = open(sys.argv[2]).read()\nreplacement = open(sys.argv[3]).read()\n\nsys.stdout.write(inp.replace(needle,replacement))\n\nLike most other solutions, it has the disadvantage that the whole file is slurped into memory at once. For small text files, it should work well enough, however.\n\nA: Approach 1: temporarily change newlines into something else\nThe following snippet swaps newlines with pipes, performs the replacement, and swaps separators back. The utility may choke if the line it sees it extremely long. You can choose any character to swap with as long as it's not in your search string.\n<old.txt tr '\\n' '|' |\nsed 's/\\(|\\|^\\)'\\''Twas … toves|Did … Bandersnatch!'\\''|/new line 1|new line 2|/g' |\ntr '|' '\\n' >new.txt\n\nApproach 2: change the utility's record separator\nAwk and perl support setting two or more blank lines as the record separator. With awk, pass -vRS= (empty RS variable). With Perl, pass -000 (“paragraph mode”) or set $,=\"\". This is not helpful here though since you have a multi-paragraph search string.\nAwk and perl also support setting any string as the record separator. Set RS or $, to any string that is not in your search string.\n<old.txt perl -pe '\n    BEGIN {$, = \"|\"}\n    s/^'\\''Twas … toves\\nDid … Bandersnatch!'\\''$/new line 1\\nnew line 2/mg\n' >new.txt\n\nApproach 3: work on the whole file\nSome utilities easily let you read the whole file into memory and work on it.\n<old.txt perl -0777 -pe '\n    s/^'\\''Twas … toves\\nDid … Bandersnatch!'\\''$/new line 1\\nnew line 2/mg\n' >new.txt\n\nApproach 4: program\nRead the lines one by one. Start with an empty buffer. If you see the “'Twas” line and the buffer is empty, put it in the buffer. If you see the “Did gyre” and there's one line in the buffer, append the current line to the buffer, and so on. If you've just appended the “Bandersnatch line”, output the replacement text. If the current line didn't go into the buffer, print the buffer contents, print the current line and empty the buffer.\npsusi shows a sed implementation. In sed, the buffer concept is built-in; it's called the hold space. In awk or perl, you'd just use a variable (perhaps two, one for the buffer contents and one for the number of lines).\n\nA: I was sure there had to be a way to do this with sed.  After some googling I came across this:\nhttp://austinmatzko.com/2008/04/26/sed-multi-line-search-and-replace/\nBased on that I ended up writing:\nsed -n '1h;1!H;${;g;s/foo\\nbar/jar\\nhead/g;p;}' < x\nWhich correctly took the contents of x:\nfoo\nbar\nAnd spit out:\njar\nhead\n\nA: Even if you dislike hoary sed and perl, you might still find a liking in grey-templed awk. This answer seems to be what you're looking for. I reproduce it here. Say you have three files and want to replace needle with replacement in haystack:\n\nawk ' BEGIN { RS=\"\" }\n      FILENAME==ARGV[1] { s=$0 }\n      FILENAME==ARGV[2] { r=$0 }\n      FILENAME==ARGV[3] { sub(s,r) ; print }\n    ' needle replacement haystack > output\n\nThis doesn't involve regular expressions and supports newline characters. It seems to work with reasonably large files. It does involve slurping the whole file into memory, so it will not work with  files of arbitrary size. If you want it more elegant, you can enclose the whole shebang in a bash script, or turn it into a awk script.\n\nA: UPDATE: loevborg's python script is certainly the simplest and best solution (there's no doubt about that) and I'm very happy with it, but I'd like to point out that the bash script I presented (at the end of the question) is nowhere near as complicated as it looks.. I trimmed out all the debugging dross which I used to test it.. and here it is again without the overburden (for anyone visiting this page).. It's basically a sed one-liner, with pre and post hex-conversions :   \nF=(\"$haystack\"  \"$needle\"  \"$replacement\")\nfor f in \"${F[@]}\" ; do cat \"$f\" | hexdump -v -e '1/1 \"%02x\"' > \"$f.hex\" ; done\nsed -i \"s/$(cat \"${F[1])}.hex\")/$(cat \"${F[2])}.hex\")/p\" \"${F[0])}.hex\"\ncat \"${F[0])}.hex\" | xxd -r -p > \"${F[0])}\"\n# delete the temp *.hex files.\n\n\nJust to throw my hat into the ring, I've come up with a 'sed' solution which won't run into any problems with special regex characters, because it uses not even one! .. instead it works on Hexdumped versions of the files...\nI think it is too \"top heavy\", but it works, and is apparently not restricted by any size limitations.. GNU sed has an unlimited pattern buffer size, and that is where the Hexdumped block of search-lines ends up.. So it's okay in that respect...\nI am still looking for a diff solution, because it will be more flexible regarding white-space (and I would expect; faster)... but until then..

Have you installed ubuntu-restricted-extras package?\n", "Q: What does it mean to mount something? I hear and read the term all the time, but what does it mean? \nI just accidentally mounted a shared folder hosted on a remote computer.  The only difference I see is the presence of a desktop shortcut.  I was able to access the folder before I mounted it with no problems.\nSo What does it mean to mount something?\n\nA: A physical device can be either \"unmounted\" or \"mounted\". However, while the \"unmounted\" state for a physical device still appears on your desktop and still is under Places, a shared folder has a different behavior. \nWhen you connect to a shared folder by using the \"Connect to server\" menu option, what Ubuntu does is it creates a sort of virtual folder. It's not actually mounted under \"/media\", but is using a special virtual network filesystem. In fact this is closer to mapping a network drive under Windows; they do not appear under your C:\\ drive, but are instead given a different drive letter, which is basically just a convenient link to the folder. In Ubuntu, the listing under Places and the icon on your desktop is the same, just a convenient link. If you connect to the folder by going through Network, you're browsing straight to the folder, just like you can in Windows. \n\nA: When you 'mount' something you are placing access to the file system contained within onto your root file system structure. Effectively giving the files a location. This is similar to the C:/D: drive labels in windows, but more flexible.\nMounting /dev/sdb1 to /mnt/disk1 places all the files and folders contained within the device standard disk B partition 1 into the directory /mnt/disk1 where you can access them.\nModern systems have ways to auto-mount drives just as windows auto-mounts drives to drive letters, but the location mounting system in Unix is much more flexible. And unmounting is obviously the removal of the access to those files/folders from that location. You can find out what file systems are mounted by running the command:\nmount\n\nParts of ubuntu involved: mount, umount, fstab (for fixed mounts), udev, gvfs (for automatic mounting)\n\nA: You know the drives you have in Windows? Like C:/ and D:/ and stuff. One of them is just your hard drive, and one of them is your cd drive, and if you plug in a flash drive or external hard drive, that'll make another letter appear. Your shared folder is the same; it's not your computer's hard drive, it's some other drive, somewhere else.\nNow, that flash drive, and your shared folder, and all of these--they're not on your computer the second you plug them in, or connect remotely, or whatever. They're not in your \"file system\". They have to get thrown into the mix, and your computer has to read them, and know that they're there, and give you a way to access them. This is \"mounting\"--plopping the drive into your file system, where you can get to it.\nIn Windows, when a drive is mounted, Windows will pick another letter, and assign that letter to the drive--and then you can access it from \"My Computer\". On Unix like systems such as Ubuntu, They go with the much nicer system of placing that icon on your desktop. So when you plug in your flash drive, instead of getting some stupid autorun dialog that is totally annoying and sometimes unsafe, you get a nice icon on your desktop to symbolize the piece of hardware you just stuck into your computer.\n\nA: You cannot access unmounted filesystems without mounting it first. filesystems and their mount-points are defined within the /etc/fstab file and you can control the mounting operation from there. The syntax of the mount command is.\nmount [options] device file mount point\nLinux recognizes and can mount several type of file systems ( including windows NTFS) provided you have the right filesystem driver.\n\nA: source\n\nWhat is meant by mounting a drive?\n  Before your computer can use any kind of storage device (such as a hard drive, CD-ROM, or network share), you or your operating system must make it accessible through the computer's file system. This process is called mounting. You can only access files on mounted media.\nFormats and mounting\n  Your computer stores data in specific, structured file formats written on a piece of media (such as a disk or CD-ROM). Your computer must be able to read the format on this media in order to interpret its data properly; if the computer does not recognize the format, it will return errors. Also, forcing your computer to work with corrupted or unrecognized formats will cause it to write data incorrectly, possibly rendering unrecoverable all the files stored on the media.\nMounting ensures that your computer recognizes the media's format; if your computer cannot recognize that format, the device cannot be mounted. When media is successfully mounted, your computer incorporates the media's file system into your local file system, and creates a mount point, a locally available link through which you access an external device. In Windows or Mac OS X, the mount point is represented by a disk or other icon; in Unix or Linux, the mount point is a directory. Most operating systems handle mounting and unmounting for you.\n\n", "Q: What does add-apt-repository mean? What does this mean?\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:maco.m/ruby\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rubygems\n\nHows does it differ from running\nsudo apt-get install rubygems\n\n?\n\nA: There are three steps to what you're running:\n\n*\n\n*add-apt-repository adds a PPA to your list of sources, (importing the GPG public key of the PPA automatically), so that Ubuntu knows to look for updates from that PPA as well as from the official Ubuntu sources. Usually this is used by developers to provide updates more quickly than in the official Ubuntu repositories.\n\n\n*apt-get update tells APT to update its database of what packages can be installed and where to install them from. In this case, apt-get will see your newly-added PPA and discover that ppa:maco.m/ruby has the newest version of rubygems that it knows about, so it will make a note to install rubygems from the PPA next time someone asks to install it.\n\n\n*apt-get install causes apt-get to find the package in its database and download and install the indicated file. In this case, it will find the rubygems package, download it from ppa:maco.m/ruby, and install it.\nIf you were to simply run apt-get install rubygems, you would get a less-recent version (or perhaps nothing at all, depending on whether rubygems is also in the Ubuntu repositories or only in the PPA).\nIn general, the format ppa:a/b will expand to https://launchpad.net/~a/+archive/b, where you can view the files and download them individually. In your case, that would be https://launchpad.net/~maco.m/+archive/ruby.\n", "Q: Monitor won't enter power save mode My LCD monitor won't enter power save mode.\nI've gone into System → Preferences → Screensaver, clicked Power Management, then set Put display to sleep when inactive for: to 10 minutes (for both On AC Power and On Battery Power), but the monitor still doesn't enter power save mode, even after an hour.\nAnyone have ideas on what to try?\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS 64-bit desktop on a Dell Latitude E6400 laptop.\nUpdate Sun Jan 16 01:02:45 PST 2011:\nI forgot to mention the laptop is docked, and the monitor is connected via DVI cable to the dock. I haven't tried waiting for power save mode using a VGA cable or no dock.\n\nA: I also have this problem and I learned a lot trying to fix it. I couldn't find a GUI fix to this. I'm on a Dell Latitude D630 running 10.10, which is docked and runs two 23\" LCDs. \nHere's what I did, and what you can try:\nxset s XXX\n\nwhere XXX is the number of seconds you want the pc to be idle before it suspends/poweroff your monitor\nxset dpms 0 0 900\n\nThe first zero is for standby, second is for suspend, and third is the off setting. This will turn off my monitor in 15 minutes if left idle.\nYou can test dpms standby, suspend and off settings with:\nsleep 1; xset dpms force standby\n\nYou can replace the word \"standby\" in the command above with  suspend or off. In my testing, they all did the same thing; they each powered off the monitor (blacklight completely off). When I moved my mouse to wake the monitors, each command did it equally as fast. For my situation, I stuck with off.\nxset -q\n\nThe above command gives you interesting details about your screensaver and DPMS settings. When I ran this command before changing anything, it says\nScreen Saver:\nprefer blanking:  yes    allow exposures:  yes\ntimeout:  0    cycle:  0\n\nand\nDPMS (Energy Star):\nStandby: 0    Suspend: 0    Off: 0\nDPMS is Enabled\nMonitor is On\n\nOn a fresh boot, the timeout and cycle value under Screen Saver are 600. Over time, they change to the above.  This is a bug, and I'm sure its been reported @ launchpad.net. I couldn't find the appropriate bug report (if someone does, please share a link).\nNow, specifying the commands above do not persist after you log out. The only way I could get it to work was to create a file called xset-start.sh in my home directory.  \nIn the file I have:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/xset dpms 0 0 900 &\n\nYou need to give the file execute permissions, otherwise it wont work.  Open a terminal and run:\nchmod u+x xset-start.sh\n\nTo have startup at logon, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications\n\n*Click Add\n\n*You can name it xset-startup\n\n*Browse to your home directory where xset-setup.sh is\n\n*Give the startup entry a comment if you'd like and click Add when finished.\n\n\nTest it by restarting your computer. After restarting, open a terminal and run \nxset -q\n\nmake sure the off value for DPMS is 900.\nI'm sure there are global files and other per-user startup files this could go in.\nthis post: External monitors don't go into standby if laptop lid is closed states that the external monitors go to sleep properly if the lid is open on the laptop. I didn't test this, but it made me think if the laptop lcd is disabled in the \"Monitor\" preferences, are the dpms settings being honored by the external monitors?\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*xset manpages\n\n*Custom X Session\n\n*A Primer on Screen Blanking Under Xorg \n\n*How to turn off the display via the command line?\nTips:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I put the display to sleep on screen lock?\n\nA: I found a solution. In the Monitor Preferences (started either via gnome-display-properties from the command line or by clicking on the monitor icon in the panel, then choosing \"Configure Display Settings ...\"), there's a visual representation of both monitors. If I drag the LCD monitor around such that it appears to the left of the laptop display, the monitor properly goes into power-save mode. Yay!\n\nA: Sometime you need a PC, who never ends his display (advertising sliders). You can use a crontab -e to put similar task, so that every seconds get increased)\ne.g:\n\n$ crontab -e\n*/5 * * * * xset s 86400\n\nNote: i am using this in my crontab, where i need to display 24/7 advertising\n\nA: In Xubuntu 13.04 (xfce 4.10), the dpms commands mentioned by MystaMax worked for me.  In addition, I found that in the XScreenSaver Preferences (Menu > System Settings > Screensaver) on the Advanced tab is a section labeled \"Display Power Management\".  Those values are persisted for me, as shown by running xset -q after setting them.\n", "Q: How to setup NX server and client?

And every time, I finally found that it would have been easier to simply reinstall Ubuntu, despite the fact that I then have to reinstall my applications. But I see several advantages to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to backup all your data to another device, since a full install also means erasing your hard disk, unless you planned id and had your data in another partition. Having a backup is always a good idea, and never hurts.\n\n*You only have the applications that you need, no more \"left-overs\" of other applications you installed. It is easy to install all kinds of programs as you find them. but do you remove them once you're done ?\n\n*Given all possible programs and utilities that are installed, and may not be ready for the new version of the distro, an upgrade to a new version is unlikely to upgrade those packages. Incompatibilities, missing libraries, etc... that can happen so easily.....\n\n*It also gives you a chance to cleanup your files, and if you re-do the file system you eliminate all fragmentation issues that can happen in any file system, under any OS.\n\n\nYes, more work, but also a better system at the end. And this is also true of other OSes. However with Linux, the $$$ cost is the same, whether this is an upgrade or a full reinstall: ZERO. Other OSes will charge you different prices depending on whether this is an upgrade or a full install.\n", "Q: Mount of File System Failed. -- After upgrading from 9.04 to 9.10 After upgrading from Ubuntu 9.04 to 9.10 I am getting this message on boot up:\n\nMount of File System Failed.

I'm so used to emacs that sometimes, when I'm typing something in a textbox in firefox, I sometimes try and do C-p to move up a line. It is seriously annoying to have to cancel a print dialog box every time I try and move about my text. If it's not horrendously complicated, I'd like to have keybindings that emulate emacs inside textboxes in firefox...\nObviously, I wouldn't need all the keybindings, but movement, marking, killing and yanking would be useful.\nIs this an insane request?\n\nA: To set emacs keybinding for all GTK based applications execute the following:\n# legacy\ngconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme Emacs --type string\n\n# modern / e.g. 12.04\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme \"Emacs\"\n\nSee also Emacs Keybindings - Firefox\n\nA: Another option might be Conkeror. Based on its Wikipedia entry, \"Conkeror is a Mozilla-based web browser designed to be navigated primarily by a computer keyboard. Its design is mainly patterned after the text editor GNU Emacs, with some influence from other programs, including vi.\"\nI haven't actually used it so I can't recommend its quality, I've only heard of it. Might be something to check out though.\n\nA: Another option is the \"It's all text\" add-on which allows you to edit textareas\nwith your favorite editor. The add-on displays a small button labeld \"edit\" at\nthe bottom of each textarea. When you press it, the editor you have configured\n(emacs) will be launched with a temporary file. When you save the file, its contents\nare transfered to the textarea. Really helpful for e. g. long wiki pages -- and you will have the complete, real emacs with all your customizations, not just an emulation of some of its keybindings.\n\nA: \nIs this an insane request?\n\nNo! :-)\nYou can install the  Firemacs addon to get emacs keybindings in Firefox:\n\nThere's also a rather technical article on MozillaZine on how to enable Emacs-style key bindings for Firefox via GTK. Both work very well, but I recommend the extension since it's so easy to install.\n\nA: If you are interested in having emacs keybindings everywhere in Gnome 3.x, you could change a few properties with gconf-editor, do a few hacks as listed in http://www.c0le.org/2011/10/emacs-keybindings-in-gnome-evolution-3x.html to get it done. Even I find myself pressing C-a and C-e in a lot of non-emacs applications\n", "Q: Automatically mount sshfs on startup? Is it possible to automatically mount a sshfs filesystem whenever the connection goes up?\n\nA: I found the easiest way to achieve this is to create a small script for the process and add it to the start up applications list. Add these two lines to a text file and save it somewhere you'll remember as something like sshfs.sh than add it to start up.\n#! /bin/bash\nsshfs <host>@<ip>: ~/<mountpoint>\n\nBe sure to create the folder before launching the script or it will have no where to mount the file system you are connecting to. The mount point can be wherever you want I just create it in my home folder.\n\nA: Does Upstart in Ubuntu work with network events? For sure you can place scripts in /etc/network/if-up.d and /etc/network/if-down.d. There is a guide on Ubuntu Forums.\nDoes this help enough?\n\nA: So if sshfs can be listed in /etc/fstab (I believe it can be), then mountall will mount it any time a network device is brought up. The issue is that when the net device goes down, you need to umount it. This would be doable with an upstart job like /etc/init/sshfs-down.conf:\n# sshfs-down\n\nstart on net-device-down IFACE!=lo\ntask\n\nexec umount /path/to/sshfs/mount\n\nOne problem will probably arise that sshfs may try to flush buffers on umount, and at the point that the net device is already down, you'll have issues.\n\nA: I think the more useful thing to do is automatically mount an sshfs file system on access. autofs can be configured to auto mount sshfs filesystems when you access the mount point and unmount after a timeout.\nHave a look at autosshfs, which allows mounting an sshfs (fuse) filesystem with a user's ssh-agent. That solves the usual authentication issue with autofs: since it runs as root it is tricky to set up to authenticate as a user without having to type a passphrase every time.\n", "Q: How can I search within a manpage? Is there a option to search within manpages?\n\nA: If you are already in the man page, / search is easy to use, but I prefer to specify my search word with the man command, so it opens directly on the first occurrence of the term. \nThis is fairly straight forward with a pipe:\nman ksh | less +/LINENO\n\nBut if you wanted to stick only to man options, it seems to be very roundabout. You have to override the default output pager (less -f) with the -P option.\nman -P 'less -p LINENO' ksh\n\n\nA: GUI Methods\nIf you have Ubuntu Desktop version installed you can search graphically.\nGnome Help\nGnome help uses yelp program. Instead of typing man ls for the CLI man page you can type yelp man:ls and view in GUI window:\n\nOnce loaded you can use Control + F to search.\nBrowser\nI open the man page on the internet and use my browsers search feature Control + F.\nFor example if in the terminal I type in man yad in my browser I would type linux man yad.\nYou sometimes need to pay attention that the internet version can sometimes have newer or older list of arguments but this has rarely happened to me.\nThe advantages of internet manpages goes beyond search facility and includes superior scrolling plus easier copying to clipboard.\n\nA: Just hit /, and type your search pattern.\n\n*\n\n*Patterns can be regular expressions, for example, you could search for the word \"option\" by typing:\n/[Oo]ption\n\nOr find all of the long arguments with:\n/(--)[a-Z]\n\nTo cancel the search, hit Ctrl+C.\nSome useful quantification operators are:\n  ?    for zero or one of the preceding expression\n  *    for zero or more of the preceding expression\n  +    for one or more of the preceding expression\n\nAnd expressions can be \"grouped\" with parentheses, as in (--)+ (for two or more dashes).\n[a-Z] is a sequence (others include [0-9], [a-z], and so on). Sequences can be combined, as in [a-Z0-9]. You can also invert expressions with the ^ operator, e.g. (--)[^a-Z]+ for all long arguments that start with anything other than a letter.\nAnother useful operation is Union (|), as in color|colour, which finds every occurrence of either \"color\" or \"colour\" (this is sometimes called boolean OR).\nIf you are searching for strings containing some of these \"reserved\" characters (like ?, *, +), prefix them with a \\  (i.e. /\\+k to search for +k).\n\n\n*To jump through the results, press N (forwards) and Shift+N (backwards).\n\n\n*There is also a way to search across all manpages:\nman -K \"Hello World\"\n\nThe man program will open the first match, and after you close it with q, offer you to\n\n*\n\n*view the current one (Return)\n\n*skip the current one (Ctrl+D)\n\n*or exit (Ctrl+C)\n\n\n\n\nA: Minor appendix to the excellent answer from Stefano:\nman uses less when no other pager specified. So you can search either with / or with ?.\nIf you search with / then you search forward and you use n to find the next match and N to find previous match and if you search with ? (search backward) n will search previous match and N will search the next match.\nUse man less for the details. \nAlso you may use man -wK word to list out all manual files with some word.\n", "Q: Mutter slows down my system My Ubuntu (10.10, netbook remix, unity) almost freezes from time to time.

Maybe I should just add this command (pkill mutter) to crontab or something\n\nA: Unity in Ubuntu 10.10 doesn't run very well on certain systems and unfortunately, there's nothing you can do about it. Personally, I'd just use Ubuntu 10.04 with the old netbook interface, and wait for Ubuntu 11.04 with Unity/Compiz, which is a major step forward performance-wise.\nEdit: Maybe you can install the old netbook interface in 10.10. I haven't tried this, but here's a question covering this topic: Uninstall Unity, rewind to old UNR interface, keeping 10.10?\n\nA: The most effective command I have found to restart/refresh mutter on 10.10 is:\nnaaman@naaman-XPS-M1330:~$ mutter-message restart\n\n\nA: Installing Unity 2D is also an option if you want something quicker (though it is still a bit unfinished):\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install and switch to the Unity 2D desktop?\n", "Q: System overrides my mount parameters in /etc/fstab [.../~]$ mount\n/dev/sda4 on / type ext4 (rw,commit=60,commit=0)\n\n\n\n[.../~]$ cat /etc/fstab\n# UNCONFIGURED FSTAB FOR BASE SYSTEM\nUUID=70739c04-fcb6-4747-803c-824f9c894f41  /  ext4  defaults,commit=60  0 1\n\nWhat can I do about it?

To try this once, press 'e' at the grub menu and add it to the kernel line.

What does cat /proc/mounts say the options are?  If that is correct, then /etc/mtab got messed up somehow, which is what mount reports.\n\nA: I think the mount options for the root filesystem are controlled by the fstab that was in use in the initramfs.\nsudo update-initramfs\n\nmay fix it.\n", "Q: Can't add NetworkManager applet to gnome panel I have researched this problem extensively and I can't seem to find an answer. In Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, I want to connect to my VPN through the NetworkManager applet. I installed all the network manager packages, including the gnome client.\nI understand I need to add the \"Notification Area\" to the panel, which I have done. I checked that the NetworkManager is running:\nnate@nate-desktop:~$ service network-manager status\nnetwork-manager start/running, process 763\n\nIn /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf, I have added managed=true (don't know    if this matters, but I saw it suggested on one forum):\nnate@nate-desktop:~$ more /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf \n# This file is installed into /etc/NetworkManager, and is loaded by \n# NetworkManager by default.  To override, specify: '--config file' \n# during NM startup.

At this point, it looks like NetworkManager is running but it's not appearing in the NotificationArea of the panel. I don't know what else to try. Any ideas?\n\nA: You'll need to start the network manager applet.  It's started by default, although it sounds like you've done some customisation.  Here's a screenshot of my entry :\n\nThis is available through system/preferences/startup applications.\n\nA: Network Manager is a separate beast from its applet for good reason: Network Manager is a daemon that persists outside of X. The applet just communicates with this daemon.\nAnyway, you want to run this:\nnm-applet --sm-disable\n\nIt's set to run on boot on my computer from System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications.\n\nA: If I'm getting you right, your network-manager wasn't installed by default. It's the same case with Ubuntu minimal installs (which I've tried), and installing it later doesn't make the nm-applet appear in the notification area. I've found the answer to this problem on Ask Ubuntu itself:\nsudoedit /etc/network/interfaces or sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces\nIn the first command, an editor in the Terminal itself appears.

I am burning an audio CD in Brasero, and so I've clicked Burn and a window comes up with one of the options asking if I want to \"Burn the image directly without saving it to disc\". What does this mean?\n\nA: In order to burn an audio cd it has to convert to cdda audio format.  It can do this on the fly or in advance, and save it to the hard disk, then burn to the cd.  If the conversion is done on the fly, and the computer can't keep up, then you can end up with a ruined cd.  This is generally not an issue on modern computers, so it is safe to burn the image directly without saving it to disc.\n", "Q: How to disable laptop internal keyboard I am using external usb keyboard.

I'll move to thunderbird fully if I'm happy with it. \nProblems I face with evolution is that I have to have the GUI running always if I want to get instant alerts and send mail immediately. Also it loads the messages slow and even after I move to the next mail, it slowly downloads all the linked images before moving on.\n\nA: This will tip them over pretty good one to use a mail client like Thunderbird and Evolution.

The GNOME project aims to provide the user with a desktop environment, and it does consist of many pieces of software. There indeed is a foundation called the GNOME foundation, and  there is a desktop environment called GNOME, but well, can GNOME itself be called software?\n\nA: \"GNOME\" is four things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A development environment encompassing several desktop features, functions and processes, one example being GTK+.\n\n*A desktop environment using software based on the development framework.\n\n*A foundation that supports other software not neccessarily part of either of the first two (although usually using GNOME libraries).\n\n*A little ceramic man, often with a hat, occasionally with a fishing rod or a wheel barrow. A garden ornament.\nAll of these are collections of software although each has different organisational features and aims. The third is more of an organisational \"umbrella\" than a discrete set of software but the first two are fairly discrete and yes, could easily be called software. Garden ornaments are rarely thought to be software.\nHearing \"GNOME\", one would usually infer the person was talking about the desktop environment... But just as people get angry about people not calling Linux \"GNU/Linux\", they might prefer you to use the longhand.\n\nA: It would be unusual to refer to the 'GNOME software', but as you say, GNOME consists of many pieces of software, so it wouldn't be wrong to say GNOME is software.\nOf course the GNOME Project and the GNOME Foundation are orgnanisations that you wouldn't describe as software.\nA similar example: KDE was recently renamed to the KDE Software Compilation.\n\nA: IMHO, for me if it consists of many pieces of software (which it does), then I'll be calling it GNOME Desktop Suite probably, but yeah, it's hard to define it as just \"software\".\n", "Q: Remove windows borders (like in lxde) I have a small screen (1280x800) and don't like to waste space.\nIs there a way to remove a title bar and the frames of the windows themselves?\nThe buttons on the title bare are easily replaced by keyboard shortcuts.\nI used to be able to do it in lxde and really liked it.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: If you are using compiz, you can turn off window decoration in Compiz Config Settings Manager through Effects -> Window Decoration. In the 'Decoration Windows' text box, delete 'any':\n\nThe question Optimizing Gnome desktop for netbook may provide you with some extra tips for maximising screen space.\n\nA: I would suggest finding a theme on gnome-look that saves space by not having borders etc.\nYou could also use emerald (if you are using compiz) and set the border size to 1px in emerald theme manager.\n\nA: You can use a theme like this\nOr you can also disable window decorations complately if you use compiz, open ccsm (CompizConfig Settings Manager), go to the Window Decoration plugin, and clear the Decoration windows option.\n\nA: Why don't you switch to lxde, you seem to know well?\nAnother choice would be to switch to the windows manager awesome, that is very minimalistic (no border and no title) and keyboard oriented.\n\nA: Openbox, the window manager used by Lxde, has a nice feature where undecorated windows are still able to have a 2px border. It is also easy to assign a keyboard shortcut to toggle window decorations; sometimes the title bar can be useful. Therefore, I suggest you use openbox as your window manager instead of compiz, or allow fullscreen windows to disable decorations by adding !(state=maxvert) to your window decoration settings in compiz.\n", "Q: aptitude update gives 404's for intrepid I'm having issues trying to update my packages.

The 'printf' I refer to is the standard-issue \"program\" (not the built-in): /usr/bin/printf \nI was testing printf out as a viable method of convert a Unicode Codepoint Hex-literal into its Unicoder character representation,   \nI was looking good, and seemed flawless..(btw. the built-in printf can't do this at all (I think)... \nI then thought to test it at the lower extreme end of the code-spectrum, and it failed with an avalanche of errors.. All in the ASCII range (= 7 bits)   \nThe strangest thing was that 3 value printed normally; they are:    \n\n\n*\n\n*$ \\u0024  \n\n*@ \\u0040  \n\n*` \\u0060  \n\n\nI'd like to know what is going on here.  The ASCII character-set is most definitely part of the Unicode Code-point sequence.... \nI am puzzled, and still without a good way to bash script this particular converion.. Suggestions are welcome.  \nTo be entertained by that same avalanche of errors, paste the following code into a terminal... \n# Here is one of the error messages\n# /usr/bin/printf: invalid universal character name \\u0041\n#  ...for them all, run the following script\n( \nfor nib1 in {0..9} {A..F}; do \n  for nib0 in {0..9} {A..F}; do\n   [[ $nib1 < A ]] && nl=\"\\n\" || nl=\" \"\n   $(type -P printf) \"\\u00$nib1$nib0$nl\"\n  done\ndone \necho \n)\n\n\nA: The three working characters are the three printable ASCII characters that are not in the C basic character set. The reason why these characters are forbidden in C is that it would be hard on compilers: they would need to perform the \\u interpolation before lexical analysis, which I think would break in a few corner cases, and would be impractical in many compilers anyway (because characters outside the basic set are only required to be allowed in a few places).\nHaving the same forbidden characters doesn't make sense in a shell utility. I suspect this is a bug, and $, @ and ` should not work either. The reason not to support them is again to make it easier to parse strings. For example, if you want to determine that there is no special character in a string you're going to put into a database query, you can check that the string doesn't contain ', and not worry about it containing \\u002a.\nConsider using recode as suggested in the GNU coreutils manual, or (more portable in practice) Perl or python.\n\nA: The printf command has reasons for not accepting characters in this range. If you look at the source code for for printf, you will see this comment:\n\nA universal character name shall not specify a character short identifier in the range 00000000 through 00000020, 0000007F through 0000009F, or 0000D800 through 0000DFFF inclusive. A universal character name shall not designate a character in the required character set.\n\nYou might be able to recompile without that check, but it looks very deliberate to me. Try instead to use the command without the \\u, for instance:\n( \nfor nib1 in {0..9} {A..F}; do \n  for nib0 in {0..9} {A..F}; do\n   $(type -P printf) \"\\00$nib1$nib0\"\n  done\ndone \necho \n)\n\n\nA: (for nib1 in {0..9} {A..F}; do \n  for nib0 in {0..9} {A..F}; do\n   $(type -P printf) \"\\x$nib1$nib0\"\n  done\ndone \necho )\n\nprints (hand format adjusted)\n            \n\n\n                    \n   ! \" # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ?\n @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \\ ] ^ _ \n ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~  \n � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �\n � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �\n � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �\n � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �\n\nNote that some \"character\" control codes \"worked\" ie.

Is it possible to give sftp access to a user without giving him ssh access?\n\nA: Well, rssh is a restricted shell providing sftp access but no ssh access.\nsudo apt-get install rssh\nsudo chsh -s /usr/bin/rssh $username\n\nYou might have to\nsudo bash -c \"echo '/usr/bin/rssh' >> /etc/shells\"\n\nto make it a \"valid\" shell.\nUpdate 9-13-2012 for Ubuntu 12.04\nThe file, /etc/rssh.conf, has the various kinds of access commented; so, for sftp, uncomment line #10, \"#allowsftp\".\nsudo -e /etc/rssh.conf\n\nChange\n#allowsftp\n\nto\nallowsftp\n\nSave.\n\nA: Set the last parameter of the /etc/passwd file (on the user's line) to /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server (or whatever sftp server you use). This will make it so that the logon shell for the user is the sftp-server, and that's all he can use. This requires less setup than the other answer, and it gets exactly to the point, although the option to allow scp later doesn't exist.\n\nA: Sometime It is useful to set umask for ftp client. To do that, create a simple script /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server-go.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n/usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server -u 0007\n\nand use it in /etc/passwd instead.\n", "Q: How do I connect to the Ubuntu One server-side CouchDB?

In the meantime, you can use a tool named ubuntuone-couchdb-query to get at your CouchDBs at Ubuntu One. You can download ubuntuone-couchdb-query from http://ubuntuone.com/p/Gyx/. \nIf you're looking for more technical information (that is, how you'd connect to your in-the-cloud Ubuntu One CouchDBs from your own programs), please clarify your question, and I can explain how ubuntuone-couchdb-query works in more detail.\n", "Q: What software can convert all video formats to iPod nano mp4 format? What software can convert all video formats to iPod nano mp4 format?\n\nA: Arista Transcoder \nArista Transcoder is designed specifically for this sort of thing. It has many presets for devices including the Ipod Nano. You can convert from a file or a number of devices, such as webcams and DVD drives.\n\n\nA: As long as you don't mind using the command line FFMPEG is the best tool for converting video formats. \n\nA: I love handbrake! To install handbrake in Ubuntu 14.04 and later run this command:\nsudo apt-get install handbrake\n\nIt's quite easy and works perfectly. For usage instructions run man handbrake\n", "Q: using locate on an encrypted partition I selected /home/ to be encrypted when I was installing Ubuntu. Now, is it possible to make locate work with an encrypted partition like this?\n\nA: I both \"run locate (updatedb) when I'm logged in\", as mentioned above, and I keep my part of the locate database under my encrypted $HOME.  \nexport LOCATE_PATH=\"$HOME/var/mlocate.db\"\n\nand then I index the files in$HOME with \nupdatedb -l 0 -o $HOME/var/mlocate.db -U $HOME\n\nNow I have a complete index of $HOME but the database isn't visible unless $HOME is mounted and decrypted. \n\nA: How about running updatedb when your file system is decrypted and try to match environment variables to read/write it?\nAfter reading the man page, add two variables to your BASH RC file.\nman locate\necho \"export LOCATE_PATH=$HOME/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db:$LOCATE_PATH\" >> ~/.bashrc\necho \"export DBPATH=$HOME/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db:$DBPATH\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\nMake the directory specified above and add $username to the mlocate group.\nmkdir -p ~/var/lib/mlocate/\nsudo usermod -a -G mlocate $username\n\nLog out and in again to count your user in the mlocate group and get the new environment variables. Now when you run,\nupdatedb -o $LOCATE_PATH\n\nare the decrypted files in a locate database now? Or, what did you do to make it work or better?\nYou may also want to add updatedb to user's crontab. First run:\ncrontab -e\n\nAnd add the following line:\n0 12 * * * updatedb -o $HOME/var/locate\n\n\nA: It's not really possible to update the database index without being logged in. You should log in and run the updatedb command.\nCheck your config in /etc/updatedb.conf. Remove ecryptfs from PRUNEFS and probably /home/.ecryptfs from PRUNEPATHS.

It should be pretty straightforward and it lets you make a custom theme or pick one of the ones offered.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu ship an application, or the latest versions of some applications? What reasons are there for applications in Ubuntu not being the most up-to-date, and why are some applications not available, in its  repositories?\n\nA: Like Martin said, the specific releases of an application is packaged with the release of Ubuntu. Which means version such and such of application1 is packaged into Ubuntu 10.04 and then that's the version available as long as you use the Ubuntu 10.04 repositories. You can add the applications repositories yourself if you'd like that app to stay up to date though. I don't believe newer versions of applications are added to the repositories unless it's part of or is a security update. This is my understanding of the situation anyway.\n\nA: Updates for final versions of Ubuntu only happen in line with the Stable Release Update Policy - that is to say, things will only be upgraded if there is an overwhelming benefit from doing so (like a security issue).\nThis is done to protect the majority of users from instability that new versions can bring. If you want a \"rolling release\" another distribution like Arch or Gentoo might be a better fit, otherwise there are unofficial PPAs for certain packages (at your own risk).  \nUpdates for the version of Ubuntu in development are more fluid but still depend on three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stability - If the new version is known to be unstable, it's less likely to find it's way into the repositories in time.\n\n*Testing - If there isn't enough people to test to new version, it's less likely to be added.\n\n*Packaging - If the maintainer is busy with other packages, it's much less likely to be packaged. For instance inkscape 0.47 missed the Maverick deadline and so wasn't added to Ubuntu until the Natty release.\nThere has been a lot of talk about how to solve this issue and allow projects to release in Ubuntu new versions for older releases, especially Long Term Support releases.\nSee this advice for scheduling: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SponsorshipProcess#Consult%20the%20Release%20Schedule\n", "Q: How do I copy packages within a PPA from one release to another? (nonsensical \"same version already has published binaries\" error) I keep getting weird errors from launchpad when I try and copy the Maverick packages to Natty for the PPA.  I select the wine1.3 package (not in Ubuntu), select \"copy to this PPA\", and then select \"rebuild the resulting binaries\".  This error emerges:\n\nThe following source cannot be copied:\nwine1.3 1.3.11-0ubuntu1 in maverick\n  (same version already has published\n  binaries in the destination archive)\n\nI have no idea what this error means but apparently it doesn't mean there are binaries in the destination archive.\n\nA: You get the error because the version wasn't bumped and the version is exactly the same. You're not supposed to have the same package with the same version in the same ppa. For releasing with multiple releases I normally either bump the minor version:\nmypackage_1.2-0ubuntu1 < for lucid\nmypackage_1.2-0ubuntu2 < for maverick\n\nOr I actually name them per release.\nmypackage_1.2-0lucid2\n\nThere is supposed to be a more formal, debian way of doing this, but I haven't found it.\n\nA: Some packages don't need to be rebuilt for different releases, e.g. documentation or python packages. Then choose \"Copy existing binaries\" option and the copy will succeed.\n", "Q: How can I connect to my TI-89 calculator? I'd like to transfer data to and from my TI-89 Titanium that connects via a USB cable.\nHow can I do this in Ubuntu?\n\nA: According to research you can access the data on the TI-89 by using a program called tilp which you can install from the repositories. See more information here:\nhttp://ohioloco.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=220045\nThere was some issue with permissions, but if you get the error, just use sudo.\nThere is also another program which might be useful to you called CalcForgeLP, this has support for the TI-89, but had some hicups with the new usb library. Maybe it's fixed. See more details here:\nhttp://tichessteamhq.yuku.com/topic/4749/t/TI89-Titanium-USB-Protocol.html\n", "Q: How can I make the date/time applet display on a single line? I just updated from Lucid to Natty (thought it was going to be Maverick, but my About Ubuntu menu shows that it is Natty, which \"was released in April 2011\" - who knew the developers had mastered time travel?!)\nIn any case, the default date/time applet in my gnome panel is now displaying on two lines (date on top of time) instead of one line like it used to. \n\nAny way to get it back on one line?\nI've tried the instructions shown here, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.\n\nA: You need to fix the core issues. Natty isn't released yet and only testers and the brave should be trying it out (although I'm sure many Ubuntu core people are already running it) it's going to have bugs. If you want a stable system, you should reinstall Ubuntu and go to Lucid or Maverick.\nNow to the actual issue shown. It looks like the date time is on two lines simply because it has enough space to do so. The top bar is larger than it should be and you can see that from the other icons which have also grown to take more space.\nIf you go into System > Preferences > Appearance then you can see the options for changing the font size and icon sizes which can have this effect on your top bar.\n", "Q: Making stripe_cache_size permanent I did\necho 8192 > /sys/block/md0/md/stripe_cache_size\n\nto improve my RAID performance, and it did helped alot.\nBut I still can't figure out how to make it permanent.\nI was trying to set it in /etc/rc.local - other commands are executed, but it was overwritten to 256 elsewhere...

I put mine in rc.local and no luck. I start it up manually after logging in. I suppose you could write a script to handle this and put it in your \"Startup Applictions\" but that doesn't help at all if you're not logged in to gnome.\n\nA: I don't have a real answer for you, but maybe you could try creating a simple upstart startup script.  Create a file in /etc/init with the .conf extension.  In the file put:\n\nstart on started tty1\nexec echo 8192 > /sys/block/md0/md/stripe_cache_size\n\nMy thinking is that that should run the command around the time that the terminal has started, which is probably around the same time you are running the command.\n\nA: Total shot in the dark as I don't have a RAID 5 setup to test with:  Maybe add a line with  \nchmod -w /sys/block/md0/md/stripe_cache_size\nin rc.local to remove the write permissions after it's set.  Maybe that will stop it from getting changed elsewhere?\n\nA: Append\necho 8192 > /sys/block/mdX/md/stripe_cache_size\n\nto  /etc/rc.local.\n\nA: This page suggests that stripe size (or width) should have been set up when the fs was set up. Maybe tunefs could help here?\n", "Q: Mount Ubuntu's partition on Windows 7 Is it possible to mount Ubuntu 10.10's partition on Windows 7?\n\nA: The most reliable way to access Linux filesystems from Windows is to do it via a virtual machine. There are several options. CoLinux is the lightest one, but might be difficult to install (I don't think there's an up-to-date distribution, so if you want ext4 and btrfs you have to assemble the pieces), and I think CoLinux doesn't work on 64-bit Windows. Otherwise you can use a hosted virtual machine such as VirtualBox, see for example How to import existing Linux partition into VirtualBox as guest?.\n\nA: The simple answer is \"it's very tricky and not polished.\" assuming you're 10.10 is installed on ext4 (which I believe is the default). \nWhat you could do is mount your /home dir on a fat32 file system and that would allow you to mount it on the windows side. This should help some if you decided to go with that route. Remember to back up the data already in your /home dir before switching where the OS looks for it.        \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingANewHardDrive \n\nA: You have a couple that can Read And/Or Write to Ext2 And/Or Ext3 And/Or Ext4 file systems and can mount this fyle systems in windows. Some are:\nExt2Read - http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2read/files/  (Most updated)\nExt2fsd - http://www.ext2fsd.com/  (Second Most Updated)\nFs Driver - http://www.fs-driver.org/ \nDisk Internals (Linux Read) - http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/ (Popular several years ago)\nExplore2FS - http://www.chrysocome.net/explore2fs (Super Popular some years ago)\nNow for the compatibility with Windows 7:\nExt2Read - Confirmed Windows 7\nExt2fsd - Confirmed on Windows 7\nFS Driver - Confirmed on Windows 7\nDisk Internals (Linux Read) - Confirmed on Windows 7\nExplore2FS - Confirmed on Windows 7  \nNow for the \"problems\" you should watch out.\nEven though you can read and maybe write to linux files and directories from windows there has been several problems regarding the issue of reading/writing from windows to Linux via tools like this. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Information lost  \n\n*Corrupted Information that was copied\n\n*Corrupted File System (Inodes, Complete Directories, Etc)\n\n*Garbage Read/Write (Like strange symbols)\n\n\nMaybe others. Some small cases include loosing a lot of information. So this is a big warning if you want to use tools like this. Anyway if has been also tested by several people and to them it worked good. So it all depends on you.\n", "Q: How to enable user sharing per instructions?

I can delete, rename and reorganize songs by clicking on the Ubuntu desktop icon for my Walkman.  However, the changes are not evident on the player itself.  Help?\n\nA: I have an IPod, and I have had great success using gtkpod. I dont know if it will work for you, but its probably worth a shot.\nsudo apt-get install gtkpod\n\nA: As @DoR pointed out, when you delete the files, they are 'recycled' into the .Trash directory on the USB device, which is still scanned by your mp3 player. But that won't account for renamed or reorganized songs.\nYou can trick Rhythmbox into managing your mp3 player, by creating a file called .is_audio_player on the device.\ntouch /media/YOUR-MP3-PLAYER/.is_audio_player\n\nUse your own MP3 player path; use TAB to auto-complete this path in the terminal.\nNow when you open Rhythmbox it will show your player. This works on normal USB disks too, great for if your car sound system takes a USB disk!\nThere are some options you can specify in the file too, but the defaults are sane and work on most players anyway.\n", "Q: How do I permanently add an identity for SSH? I need to run ssh-add <key> everytime I need to ssh into a webserver. Is there a way to add the ID permanently, so I dont have to keep adding the identities on each login?\nEDIT: The key is a pem file, that I have downloaded from a cloud service.\n\nA: You can generate a ssh key with the command:\nssh-keygen\n\nThen you can copy your key to the server with:\nssh serveruser@servername \"echo `cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub` >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\" \n\nNow you can automatically log in your webserver\n\nA: Generate your key like normal: ssh-keygen, then place that key to the remote server with ssh-copy-id, which will sync it to the remote server's accepted keys.\nssh-keygen\nssh-copy-id user@host\n\nIt will prompt for your password then perform all the steps necessary to link your .pub key with the remote SSH server.\nBy default it will copy all your .pub keys to the remote server. If you just created your key with ssh-keygen then this isn't a problem (because you only have one!). However, if you have multiple keys you can copy just a specific key with the -i flag.\nssh-copy-id -i ~.ssh/key_name.pub user@host\n\nReplacing key_name.pub with the name of the key.\n\nA: If your key is password-less and named as one of the files ssh will try to look for when identifying (~/.ssh/id_dsa or ~/.ssh/id_rsa), you shouldn't have to add it to your agent. \nBUT. If there's the slightest possibility of those files being stolen, you would have just allowed anyone to access the servers on which you are using this identity. In short, pwned.\nIMHO, password-less private keys are a bad practice, and should be used only on environments where ~/.ssh/authorized_keys is very restrictive.\n\nA: put this in your ~/.bashrc\neval $(ssh-agent)\nssh-add ~/.ssh/where_ever_privake_key_is \n\n\nA: Write a short shell script which will run ssh-add and then connect such as the following:\nssh-add ~/.ssh/your-key\nssh user@remotehost\n\nYou can then ssh into your host with one command.\n\nA: For AWS, download the pem key, and run:\nssh-add /path/to/pemfile.pem\n\nThat worked for me, ubuntu 18.04.

Compiz runs fine, as well as most of GNOME Shell's animations. \nThe animation for switching to and from GNOME Shell overview is just very slow. Unfortunately, it's the most common animation on Shell.\nI already applied\ncd ~/gnome-shell/source/gnome-shell\ncurl http://bugzilla-attachments.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=157326 > shell-animations-nvidia.patch\ngit am shell-animations-nvidia.pat\n\nthat I found from http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/SwatList , but the issue's still here.\nHow do I fix this?\nEDIT:\nApparently, it's an NVIDIA driver bug, which has something to do with the message tray.

Is it possible to remove a particular host key from SSH's known_hosts file?\nI usually end up deleting the entire known_hosts file, which I have no problems with doing, but just out of curiosity, is it possible to remove just a single entry? \nI opened the known_hosts file, but I am struggling to understand its contents.\nBelow is the message I faced, which led me to ask this question:\nAdd correct host key in /home/wissen16/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.\nOffending key in /home/wissen16/.ssh/known_hosts:1\nRSA host key for foo.com has changed and you have requested strict checking.\nHost key verification failed.\n\n\nA: Use this command to remove entries from known_hosts:\nssh-keygen -R hostname\n\n\nA: This one worked for me. This is the default method shown in the display when tried to add a known host.\nssh-keygen -f \"/home/noob/.ssh/known_hosts\" -R \"172.16.132.132\"\n\nJust you have to change the IP address and host file path here.\n\nA: Yes, you can remove just one key. Just open it in an editor and delete the offending line. The number after the colon in the error message is the line number, so that's the line to delete -- line 1 in your example..\n\nA: Using ssh-keygen -R hostname will not always work. If you have a newer version of SSH that is \"hiding\" the hostnames to prevent ssh-agent hijacking, apparently ssh-keygen is unable to unhash the hostname.\nFor example, I have a host called build-node-01 and I have connected to it and accepted the key. I then rebuild it from scratch, getting a new host fingerprint and I try to reconnect, I will get a warning that there is a conflict on line X (say 3). I run ssh-keygen -R hostname, but the next time I try to connect I still get a warning that there is a conflict. I examined the file only to discover that the hostname was hashed and showed up as [1] Bu4Ch@R@4D0M57uFF instead of a readable hostname.\nIn this case the only way to successfully get the offending host removed was to use\nsed -i 'xd' ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\nTo take this sed one step further, you may wish to make a backup of the known_hosts in case you delete the wrong line, in this case just add a .bak (or any extension) to the -i option to create a backup with that extension. Using ssh-keygen does this automatically.\nsed -i.bak 'xd' ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\n\nA: I have only recently started using host key's, but when I have messed with them it is generally one key per line so backup the file and remove them one at a time until you find the right one. Then add the others back. Bit of a long way to do it, but should work.\nAlso based on that error, and with no idea what so ever, it could be the first host key in the file that is the problem so open up the file with vim\nvim ~/.ssh/known_hosts\nand hit \ndd\nthen save it.\n\nA: Just to share another clean and easy answer I just found. Removing the hostname is out for me, as the known_hosts file is hashed. However, I COULD manually edit out the host entry based on the line number in the error message. As noted by Mike Scott previously, the offending hostname line number is in the error message. \nOr, I can do this. From here: how to fix offending key in ssh known_hosts file\nI got this bit of cli magic\nsed -i 'xd' ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\nReplace the x with the line number, and voila. He also offers a perl answer if the sed will not work.\n\nA: If you want to remove host key for certain ip, then this will help:\nssh-keygen -f \"~/.ssh/known_hosts\" -R \"49.12.89.136\"\n\nA: To remove the offending entry is this\nsed -i '/<ipaddr|hostname>/d' ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\nI cobbled together the below scipt.  Just save it as ~/.rmhost\n#!/bin/bash\n\nrmhost_help()\n{\n        echo \"Usage rmhost {ipaddr|hostname}\"\n        echo \"          -h      Print this help message\"\n        exit 0\n}\nif [ -z $1 ] || [ $1 == \"-h\" ]; then rmhost_help\n\nfi\n\nsed -i \"/$1/d\" ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\necho \"host $1 removed\"\nexit 0\n\nThen put this alias in ~/.bashrc\nalias rmhost=~/.rmhost\nWhen you get the error just type in 'rmhost {ipaddr|hostname}'\n\nA: sed '/10\\.20\\.120\\.211/d' ~/.ssh/known_hosts > temp && mv temp ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\nIn this case, 10.20.120.211 is the host I want to delete from my known_hosts file, make sure you escape the special characters like (.)\n\nA: You can avoid removing the particular host by updating it:\nssh-keyscan -t ecdsa hostname >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\nThis way you don't have to connect again to the host.\n\nA: If you are getting fingerprint option while adding rsa token use that. Once you choose fingerprint option it will add the host name of the stash repo to the known_host\n", "Q: How do the environments of a standard Terminal command-line and a bash script differ? I know there is something different about the environment of the Terminal command-line and the environment in a bash script, but I don't know what that difference is...    \nHere is the example which finally led me to ask this quesiton; it may flush out some of the differences.  \nI am trying to strip leading '0's from a number, with this command.\n\n\n*\n\n*var=\"000123\"; var=\"${var##+(0)}\" ; echo $var\nWhen I run this command from the Terminal's command-line, I get:  123 \nHowever, when I run it from within a script, it doesn't work; I get:  000123 \nI'm using Ubuntu 10.04, and tried all the following with the sam results:\n\n\n*\n\n*GNOME Terminal 2.30.2  \n\n*Konsole 2.4.5\n\n*#!/bin/bash  \n\n*#!/bin/sh  \n\n\nMy bash version 4 1 5 1 release i486-pc-linux-gnu (in terminals and scripts)\n'shopt' differences between CLI and Script:  \n    CLI   Script  \n    on     off    checkwinsize    \n    on     off    expand_aliases  \n    on     off    extglob         \n    on     off    histappend      \n    off    on     hostcomplete    \n\n\nWhat is causing this difference? \nEven if some upgrade will make it work in scripts...\nI am trying to find out the what and why, \nso in future, I'll know what to look out for.   \n\nHere are 3 bash ways to strip leading '0's. (I knew only one when I first asked this queston)  \nvar=0001230; var=\"$[10#$var]\";           echo $var   # fastest= 1.00  integers only\nvar=0001230; var=\"${var##+(0)}\";         echo $var   # slower x 1.25  works with strings, but requires shopt -s extglob\nvar=0001230; var=\"${var#${var%%[!0]*}}\"; echo $var   # slower x 1.61  works with strings  \n\n\nA: Assuming that you're using the same shell in your script and in your terminal, the main difference is that ~/.bashrc is read by interactive shells but not by script-interpreting shells. The reason is that scripts are usually meant to be somewhat portable, and for that you don't want to depend on the user's shell customizations.\nMany things in typical .bashrc files only apply to the command line anyway (prompt settings, key bindings). Some, like function definitions, make sense in scripts as well; typically you'd put them into a separate file and source it both from ~/.bashrc and scripts. Sometimes you want some shell options for interactive use but not in scripts, because they lead to shorter (good on the command line) but more cryptic or less portable (bad in scripts) code. There are a few things that bash does differently, e.g. history expansion (!!, etc.) is on by default only in interactive shells.\nHere you're using the +(…) construct, which is a ksh extended globbing pattern. Bash doesn't enable them by default (for backward compatibility) but you can turn them on with shopt -s extglob. Apparently you have this in your ~/.bashrc.\nYou can put shopt -s extglob in your script, or use a portable way of truncating leading 0s from a variable such as\nvar=${var#${var%%[!0]*}}\n\n\nA: Your question cannot be answered quite generally. Some comments though. On my version of bash (3.1.17(1)-release), your command doesn't have the desired output even when run from the command line; the same with zsh. So presumably something is fishy about your command. I don't know what \"##+(0)\" is suppoed to accomplish, but \"#0\" succeeds in removing one leading zero. This show a way to remove arbitrary numbers of zeros.\nIf there really is a difference between the behavior on the command line and from a script, then most likely the script uses a different interpreter (different bash version, bash instead of zsh) or different shell options (try running shopt). The latter difference might be the result of your interactive shell sourcing $HOME/.bashrc and $HOME/.profile whereas scripts generally don't. That shouldn't affect environment variables, as they're inherited if exported, but it should affect shell options, which need to be set in every shell.\n", "Q: How do I limit internet bandwidth?

When I log in Gnome appears to have lost a lot of its settings: it plays sounds in weird places, UI elements look like they're from the 90s (GTK+ defaults) and it's generally pretty hideous.\nNote everything works fine. It's not like my profile doesn't exist because I can browse the internet fine (Firefox knows my bookmarks, history, passwords, etc) and my desktop is unscathed (apart from the icon theme).\nManually restarting gdm doesn't fix this. I have to do a full reboot.\nNow I'm almost certain that this is a nvidia issue causing X to baulk (I've seen similarish threads on nvnews) and I'm happy with that (my fault for running their latest drivers all the time). What I'm concerned about is why Gnome looks so fugly. Is there anything I can do to force it to reload its settings without restarting the whole computer.\nRestarting is an issue for me as I run several daemons that other computers on the network depend upon.\nThis is what I mean by ugly/fugly... Look at that scroll bar!\n\n\nA: It's a pretty simple deal. Run killall gnome-settings-daemon in a terminal (just to be sure it's really dead), then run gnome-settings-daemon & (or install grun and use grun gnome-settings-daemon).\nThis will cause gnome to regain it's settings unless you have a more serious issue.\n", "Q: Override Built-In Maverick Keyboard Shortcuts Having used the Command+M keyboard shortcut to minimize windows in OS X, I'd like to use the same functionality in Ubuntu 10.10. When I try, though, it only brings up the \"communications\" section of the indicator applet; like so:\n\nIn the Keyboard Shortcuts preferences, I have set as the minimize shortcut Mod4+M, which I got by capturing the Apple Command key and the M key. I find no other shortcut using this key combination in Keyboard Shortcuts, and yet I cannot get the window to minimize when using it.\nDoes anyone know how to override Ubuntu's default usage of this key combination? Thanks!\n\nA: Is it this bug? Bug #558581\nIt looks like an annoying race condition between programs that use global key bindings.\nAt that URL, Alex Beels wrote on 2011-01-05:\n\nTo replace indicator-applet with indicator-applet-complete:,\n\n*\n\n*Install indicator-applet-complete.\n\n*Remove both indicator-applet (the mail icon) and indicator-session (the on-off button) from the gnome panel.(Right click on icon, and choose \"Remove From Panel\" from the menu.)\n\n*Add indicator-applet-complete to the gnome panel.

One of the best things about it (and for myself, the main reason for using Linux) is the customization.  If you don't like something, you can change it.   There is no reason anything has to be any way.  \nIt is a tradition in the Linux world to provide mechanism, not policy.  When keybindings are hardwired, it's an issue with the interface.  In a distro that holds polishing the interface so highly, this is inexcusable.\n\nA: To minimize windows in Ubuntu,  use Alt+F9.  It is simply learning something new.\n", "Q: Why is Evolution the default mail/calendar package? Why is Evolution the default mail/calendar package that comes with Ubuntu?\nWhy not Thunderbird + Lightning?\nAre there any features in Evolution that are not available in Thunderbird + Lightning? \nCan I use the Evolution database via a Samba network share, on a Windows XP or 7 client, just like I can do with Thunderbird?\nWhat happens if I uninstall Evolution from my 10.04 system? Will I lose any integrated functionality built into the system?\n\nA: Evolution indeed is part of the GNOME Project. That's why it's Ubuntu's default mail client, I suppose.\nObviously, this makes it better integrated into the GNOME desktop, especially when running Ubuntu. Please not that some of the following features can be achieved with Thunderbird, too, but it does require some work and doesn't come like that out of the box.\n\n\n*\n\n*Notifications: Evolution makes use of native notify-osd-notifications whereas thunderbird brings its own notifications and doesn't blend into the desktop as much as Evolution does\n\n*Messaging-Menu: Evolution is integrated into Ubuntu's Messaging Menue\n\n*GnuPG-Integration: While Enigmail is good and can be found in the repos, Evolution does come with GnuPG integration without having to install any additional packages\n\n\nAdditionally, some features like Exchange integration are present in Evolution, too. Those, too, could be added to Thunderbird via Extensions. For private desktop use, though, Evolution provides a more integrated experience.\n\nA: Evolution like many other applications is part of the GNOME Project. You're free to replace it at no risk by any email-client you like better.\n", "Q: Is there alternative to IEtester? i used to use ietester in windows for testing site. but i found that it has no downloads for linux. is there any alternative for ietester in ubuntu.\n\nA: Install PlayOnLinux, and then use it to install IE7 and/or IE6.\n\n\n*\n\n*First: In software centre install playonlinux\n\n*Open PlayOnLinux \n\n*Click install and choose internet \n\n*Choose the IE version you want and click apply \n\nA: Not really. And for fairly good reason.\nIETester runs multiple versions of Internet Explorer. You can just about run IE in Wine but it's neither a pleasant experience (not that it is in Windows) or is it guaranteed to be representative of what Windows users are actually seeing.\nYour best bet is to either outsource this sort of testing to something like BrowserShots et al either for free or a small amount of money each month (you often get what you pay for), or install something like VirtualBox and run a small virtual XP install when you want to test IE and Window's versions of other browsers.\nI tend to do both:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'll do initial development in native Firefox\n\n*Then I'll test in a VirtualBoxxed XP install, go back and make whatever fixes I need.\n\n*Then I ship the whole thing off to BrowserShots so I can see how it looks on other platforms at the same time.\n\nA: Also have a look at linie, which looks promising and actively developed, although I haven't tried it.\n\nA: modern.ie: Free Windows virtual machines from Microsoft with a variety of IE versions available.\n\nA: an online tool provided by microsoft: browserstack which is 19$/Month but you can try the trial for a while.\n\nA: You can try LambdaTest https://www.lambdatest.com/ the pricing starts at $19, even we use the same.\n", "Q: Syncing apt-get installations between multiple computers Is there a way to synchronize my installations (and removals) between multiple PCs?\nPreferably with dropbox - since I'm already using that to keep my files in sync.\nI thought of an alias for the apt-get install and apt-get remove commands that stores the parameters to a file (one for install, one for remove) and another command that reads all the entries in the file and executes the respective command. Is this a realistic approach?\n\nA: You could use puppet to create configuration files specifying which packages should be installed, and you could use Dropbox rather than a puppetmaster server to synchronise the puppet config between machines, plus a cron job to periodically run puppet and implement any config changes.\n\nA: This is an old question, but since no one has said it, you could possibly do something with dpkg and cron. Set up a cron job that does something clever with the get-selections and set-selections commands of dpkg.\ndpkg --set-selections < ~/Dropbox/selections.dpkg\n\n\ndpkg --get-selections > ~/Dropbox/selections.dpkg\n\nThis isn't a proposed solution, you'll have to work out some way to make sure that the selections.dpkg gets updated whenever you make a change on either computer... \n\nA: Ubuntu Software Center has a feature for syncing installed packages among multiple computers. It uses your Ubuntu One account for saving packages. Just select File > Sync Between Computers... and login with your Ubuntu One account.\n\nCurrently it has somehow limited functionality, for example it only supports default packages (not ppas), and you must manually select which packages to install (this can be seen as a positive feature tough). For detailed instructions, see this article.\n\nA: I don't know if there is a better way (there probably is), but depending on the scale you need, you could use aptitude's search feature for part of the machinery. It lets you search for packages matching a pattern. So, aptitude search '~i' gives you all installed packages\nWe need to go a step further, though. The packages manager likes to know which packages were directly requested by you and which ones were just pulled in because of other packages. Without that information, ugly stuff can happen. So, we can expand on that search pattern to select packages that are not automatically installed: aptitude search '!~M ~i'\nThe search feature is covered in some detail in Aptitude's reference manual.\nNow, you have your list of packages to install. You can format the output as necessary by passing the -F flag to that command, like -F '%p' to get a list with just package names.\n\nFor example, you could run this on machine 1:\naptitude -F \"%c %p\" --disable-columns search '!~M ~i' | awk -F \" \" '{ print \"apt-get -y install \" $2 }' > aptshell.sh\n\nThen copy the newly created aptshell.sh file over to machine 2 and and use this command on machine 2 to run it there:\nsudo sh aptshell.sh\n\nThen repeat the process, with the original machine 2 as the new machine 1, and the original machine 1 as the new machine 2. Now each machine has all the packages that were formerly only on the other.\n\nA: You won't be able to use dropbox to sync package installs.\nSynaptic does have a way to save a package download list, but I'm not sure it handles the case of \"everything that's ever been installed\" rather than just \"these are the packages I want to download this time\"\n", "Q: Is there a way to suspend/sleep via bash? I have to get nine 46\" LCD monitors (running Windows) to suspend/sleep at 8pm and wake at 8am every morning. It's been a bit of a mess trying to get the commands working, including the privileges. Since I'm an Ubuntu user first and foremost, I'm wondering how easy this would be in Ubuntu/Linux.\nI know cron would be able to run my suspend/sleep command at 8pm (what is the suspend/sleep command anyway?), but what about waking the machine up at 8am without using Wake-on-Lan or manual intervention?\n\nA: command to suspend is pm-suspend\npress pm- and a tab to see other power management commands.\nI don't think there will be an option to wake the systems by itself as the os itself is not running. You can have one system dedicated to wake the other systems at a particular time. If you don't want to suspend or hibernate but just minimise use of resources, there are ways to spin down hard disk or switch off monitor alone etc. There is a pm-powersave command too. \n\nA: Just for the monitor? Does this solution from systembash.com work for you?\nCrate a BASH script to use DPMS feature:\n#!/bin/bash\n# /usr/local/bin/monitorControl.sh\n#\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\n\nif [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo usage: $(basename $0) \"on|off|status\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ $1 = \"off\" ]; then\n    echo -en \"Turning monitor off...\"\n    xset dpms force off\n    echo -en \"done.\\nCheck:\"\n    xset -q|grep \"Monitor is\"\nelif [ $1 = \"on\" ]; then\n    echo -en \"Turning monitor on...\"\n    xset dpms force on\n    echo -en \"done.\\nCheck:\"\n    xset -q|grep \"Monitor is\"\nelif [ $1 = \"status\" ]; then\n    xset -q|sed -ne 's/^[ ]*Monitor is //p'\nelse\n    echo usage: $(basename $0) \"on|off|status\"\nfi\n\nAnd then use cron entires to call it:\n0 20 0 0 0 /usr/local/bin/monitorControl.sh off\n0  8 0 0 0 /usr/local/bin/monitorControl.sh on\n\nOtherwise, if it's not just the monitor, look at /etc/acpi/sleep.sh and /etc/acpi/hibernate.sh .\n\nA: \nI don't think there will be an option to wake the systems by itself as the os itself is not running.\n\nAs a matter of fact, before you suspend the system, you can set a waking time or timer, using the internal hardware clock of the system, by using the \"rtcwake\" command:\nfor example, to wake the computer on tomorrow 8:00:\nsudo rtcwake -t `date -d \"tomorrow 08:00:00\" +%s` -m no\n\nthen you can use the pm-suspend to suspend the system.\n", "Q: Can I expand my /boot without upsetting the system? This is the current state of my partition table. As can be seen, the boot is very small, and I can't upgrade the kernel, because the update-manager tells me there isnt enough space on /boot :( Which effectively means that I can't update my kernel.

It looks like your partition is big enough. Is it ok to remove old kernels? What is the kernel you are currently using? (uname -r) It might output something like 2.6.35-24-generic. And which kernels are installed? (ls /boot | grep vmlinuz), which might output something like\nvmlinuz-2.6.35-22-generic\nvmlinuz-2.6.35-24-generic\n\nIn this example, you know you are using 2.6.35-24, so look for 2.6.35-22.\ndpkg -l | grep 2.6.35-22\n\nThe output tells us which names to use for removing them\nii  linux-headers-2.6.35-22 2.6.35-22.35\n    Header files related to Linux kernel version 2.6.35\nii  linux-headers-2.6.35-22-generic 2.6.35-22.35\n    Linux kernel headers for version 2.6.35 on x86/x86_64\nii  linux-image-2.6.35-22-generic 2.6.35-22.35\n    Linux kernel image for version 2.6.35 on x86/x86_64\n\nNow we can\nsudo apt-get remove linux-headers-2.6.35-22 linux-headers-2.6.35-22-generic linux-image-2.6.35-22-generic\n\nto make room for the new kernel to be installed.\n\nA: You posted the output of df, which is not a listing of your partition table.  For that you need to post the output of fdisk -lu.  The question is, what follows your /boot partition on the disk?  If it is not free space, or another partition that you can shrink a bit and move over, then no, you can not expand the /boot partition.\nAn alternative is to simply do away with the /boot partition.  First unmount the /boot partition and then remount it somewhere else, like /mnt.  Then sudo cp -ax /mnt /boot to copy all of the files over to your root partition.  Then remove the /boot partition entry from your /etc/fstab, and finally reinstall grub with sudo grub-install /dev/sda.\n", "Q: Gnome/X logs off immediately after login -- which logfiles are relevant? I've been tinkering with fingerprint-gui as well as X/xrandr resolution settings.\nWhen I start my machine, it boots up normally. As soon as X and gnome have finished starting, it logs me off automatically and brings me back to the gdm login prompt with the user list. Then I am, however, able to log in using \"Ubuntu Desktop Fail-safe\".\nI've checked the list of start-up applications, but everything seems fine there.\nI can't yet put my finger on what exactly might be responsible for this: X, gnome or some messed up pam.d settings. So far I've checked /var/logs/X11/xorg.0.log, /var/logs/auth.log and ~/.xsession-errors. In addition, I don't quite seem to understand the \"interplay\" between X, GDM, GNOME, GNOME-policykit, PAM.d and all that.\nAre there any other relevant log files that could point me to what's broken?\nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat\n\n*IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad R60, ATI Radeon x1400 Mobility\n\n*all updates installed\n\n*Linux User 1 year+, \n\n\nA: I know this is an ancient question but it just happened to me.  It turned out that the last line of my ~/.profile was returning a non-zero exit code.  Since the bash 'source' command returns as its exit code the last exit code of the script sourced, I imagine this upset the xsession init.\nYou may see evidence of this in ~/.xsession-errors (I did), but then you might not if your last profile command returns an error code without printing any output.  \nSo take a look at the bottom of each of your login scripts.  Worked for me.\n\nA: Without seeing the log files it's difficult to say where the bug comes(use pastebin.ubuntu.com or report a new bug to Launchpad by running ubuntu-bug xorg-server, but try look gdm's logs at /var/log/gdm/ (that folder may not be accessible without root access).\n\nA: For posterity - I'll leave a solution here...\nThis can happen if you try and run an X server under root privilege while logged in to your account... so you could have typed:\nsudo startx\nor were messing with xauth as root.\nThis will create a file in your home directory ~/.Xauthority which is owned by root.\nWhen you try to login the system will try to read this file but will not have permission and log you back out.\nThe solution is to \n\n\n*\n\n*go out to a terminal Ctrl+Alt+F1\n\n*log in to your account\n\n*type: sudo mv ~/.Xauthority ~/old.Xauthority\n\n*now log out by typing \"logout\"\n\n*get back to dm with Ctrl+Atl+F7\n\n*you should be able to log in now!\n\n\nIf you don't have sudo privilege, you have to get someone who does on your system\n\nA: This happened to me recently. I solved my issue by looking in the lightdm logs (/usr/log/lightdm/*). In my case, it was trying to load a session called gnome-shell when none existed.  I copied /usr/share/xsession/gnome.session to /usr/share/xsession/gnome-shell.session and things worked out fine.\n(Note, I realize that this probably would not work for the asker, as Ubuntu wasn't using LightDM in 10.10.  However, if the question had been asked today, or if someone searches today, this is a likely answer.)\n\nA: it might happen that your PATH variable is messed up. To fix the issue:\nPress Alt+Ctrl+F5 in login screen\nexport PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\nNow log back in to the front screen and try to login.\n\nA: This happened to me (on Xfce) after copying a .mov file to the Desktop. Using ssh to remote login and deleting the file resolved the issue \n\nA: Okay Guys, I found the real solution to this problem, for all those who have the NVIDIA graphics cards installed. \nThe best solution is to uninstall the Nvidia drivers. \n( But I recommend using their driver .run file to uninstall \nsimply doing: sudo apt purge nvidia--*  etc. did not work for me )\nDuring installation on my system I had downloaded the latest nvidia-driver as a .run file from their website: \nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-archive.html \nI had the .run file saved in ~/Downloads as nvidia-drivers.run\nOnce in the login screen, i did the steps below: \n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl+alt+f6\n\n*login\n\n*sudo service lightdm stop\n\n*cd to ~/Downloads directory where nvidia-drivers.run file is stored.\n\n*sudo nvidia-drivers.run --uninstall\n\n*sudo service lightdm restart\n\n\nSee step5: This will properly uninstall all the Nvidia drivers and you can immediately log back in. Good Luck !\n", "Q: Will deleting files on my computer delete them them in Ubuntu one? OK. So I usually save my files online and not on my computer. I am hoping to be able to set up my Ubuntu One cloud to recognize changes made to documents and add new documents when synchronizing. But not delete from the cloud, files I have deleted from my computer. Does anyone know if this is possible? I have searched around and can't figure out the answer to my question. I would appreciate any direction. Thank you so much!\n\nA: No, this can't be done, and I don't see it happening either because the idea of synchronizing everything but deletes is fundamentally against the way we think sync should work.\nUnless what you want is to be able to undelete the file at any point in the future... that is something else, and entirely possible.\n\nA: I am no expert just enjoying the Ubuntu One experience.\nThe only way I can see you doing this is to create a dummy folder as a link and turn off sync with it, then upload the files via the browser to that directory.\nI have not tried it but it should work.\n\nA: To my knowledge, and from my experience (someone correct me if I'm wrong) deleting the files on your system also deletes them from the cloud.

If you do not know the source of this file, launching it may be unsafe.\"\nSo my question is how to make such a launcher on my Desktop? \nOtherwise, what kind of file are these [Desktop Entry] files and how can they be executed (by double clicking on them) if they have permissions such as:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   396 2010-12-17 15:23 compiz.desktop\n\nA: As a security policy you can't \"execute\" .desktop files from nautilus unless they have +x (execute permission).\nBecause you have created a symbolick link you must set the +x on the original desktop file, open a terminal and execute:\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/share/applications/compiz.desktop\n\nPlease note that the +x maybe lost if the compiz package get's updated, it's probably a better idea to copy the .desktop file and set the +x on your copy.\n\nA: Do you have a reason to use a link to /usr/share/applications/compiz.desktop?\nIf you simply copy it to your Desktop you will be able to Mark as Trusted :  \n\n", "Q: sudo: source: command not found I've been updating some of the default profile for bash, and saw from the tutorials I was following that I could reload the new profile with the new environment settings by using:\nsource /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nThe only thing is - the new environment variables were only available to my current user - and were ignored when I used sudo. They only became available to sudo when I closed my terminal session and rejoined.\nWhen I try to use:\nsudo source /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nI get the error:\nsudo: source: command not found\n\nIs there a simple way to load in the new bash profile settings for sudo without having to close the terminal and restart?\n--\nInitially, I was using some installer scripts which referenced the variables. I found that while they could access the variables when I called the scripts directly (although, this would cause a later problem with creating directories as I needed to be root), calling the install scripts using sudo wouldn't.\nI proved this by testing with these simple commands:\necho $ENV_VARIABLE\nsudo echo $ENV_VARIABLE\n\nThe first would output the variable's value, but the second wouldn't output anything.\n\nA: As Marcos says, your main problem here is that source is a shell builtin command that affects only the shell process in which it's run. \nThe easy solution is to just start a new shell as root, and bash will automatically read /etc/bash.bashrc when it starts.  That's as simple as just saying\nsudo bash\n\n\nA: Closing and reopening the terminal should not change things.  By default, sudo strips the environment.  To disable that, add -E to sudo.\n\nA: The error happens because the binary you are trying to call from command line is only part of the current user's PATH variable, but not a part of  root user's PATH.\nYou can verify this by locating the path of the binary you are trying to access. In my case I was trying to call \"bettercap-ng\". So I ran,\n$ which bettercap-ng\n/home/user/work/bin/bettercap`\n\nI checked whether this location is part of my root user's PATH.\n$ sudo env | grep ^PATH\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin\n\nSo sudo cannot find the binary that I am trying to call from commandline. Hence returns the error command not found. \nYou can direct sudo to use the current user's PATH when calling a binary like below.\nsudo -E env \"PATH=$PATH\" [command] [arguments]\n\nIn fact, one can make an alias out of it:\nalias mysudo='sudo -E env \"PATH=$PATH\"'\n\nIt's also possible to name the alias itself sudo, replacing the original sudo.\n\nA: Some UNIX shell does not support source. instead, they support . So try this\n. /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nHope it works\n\nA: The problem is not that source is a shell builtin command. The fact that it is is what's actually throwing you the command not found error, but it doesn't mean it would work if it were.\nThe actual problem is how environment variables work. And they work like this:\nevery time a new process is started, if nothing happens, it inherits the environment of its parent. Due to this, using a subshell (e.g. typing bash inside a bash instance) and looking at the output of env should give similar results than its parent.\nHowever, due to how sudo works (as stated in its manpage), sudo tries to strip the environment of the user and create a \"default\" environment for the supplanting user, so that the command run is run as if the user who invoked it had been the calling user (which is the expected behaviour), and thus running nautilus as sudo nautilus should open a folder at the /root folder, and not /home/yourusername.\nSo:\nDoing something like sudo source script.sh and then sudo command, even if it worked, it wouldn't be successful at setting any variable to the later sudo command.\nIn order to pass environment variables, you can either tell sudo to preserve the environment (via the -E switch; and having appropriate permissions in your sudoers file) and/or setting it for the command as sudo VAR1=VALUE1 VAR2=VALUE2 command.\n\nA: The problem is that source is a bash build-in command (not a program - like ls or grep). I think one approach is to login as root and then execute the source command.\nsudo -s\nsource /etc/bash.bashrc\n\n\nA: Using bash process substitution you can do:\nsource <(sudo cat /etc/bash.bashrc)\n\n\nA: It doesn't work because source is a built in command, not a program. I wrote a bash script to force sudo on built in commands:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction forceSudo()\n{\n    command=\"${@}\"\n    file=\"${@: -1}\"\n    if ! $command 2>/dev/null\n    then\n        permission=$(stat -c '%a' $file)\n        sudo chmod o+rx $file\n        result=$command 2>/dev/null\n        sudo chmod $permission $file\n        if ! $result\n        then\n            echo $result\n        fi\n    fi\n}\n\nSave the file as forceSudo and save it in your scripts location, possibly ~/.local/bin. To avoid having to source the file before using the function, add alias forceSudo='unalias forceSudo && . forceSudo && forceSudo \"$@\"' to ~/.bashrc.\nNow you can use forceSudo source /etc/bash.bashrc.\n", "Q: VirtualBox Seamless Mode -- No Window Borders?

Eclipse won't let me select shared folder on a Samba server.\nUbuntu's URI for this share is of the form:\n   smb://userid@192.168.0.2/sandbox/workspace\n\nBut even if I typed this manually into the edit box, Eclipse won't accept it.\nI don't have this problem with Eclipse 3.6 on Windows.\nIs there a workaround to solve this?\n\nA: It will help to use CIFS.

Replace the  with the local username. The following will open up the GEdit application:\nsudo gedit /home/<LOCALUSERNAME>/.smbcredentials\n\nPlace your username and password into the file. Replace the  and  with the appropriate information:\nusername=<REMOTEUSERNAME>\npassword=<REMOTEPASSWORD>\n\nSave and exit.\nChange the permissions on the file to prevent unwanted eyes from viewing your remote share's logon information:\nsudo chmod 600 /home/<LOCALUSERNAME>/.smbcredentials\n\nOpen the file system table file for editing. The following will use GEdit to edit it:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nAdd the remote share to the table on a line by itself.

URIs need programs which understand the protocol mentioned in the URI i.e smb in case of samba share and ftp in case of FTP. We do not expect Eclipse to use an ftp location as a workspace and in the same manner it may not be able to use an smb location as workspace. If you want to use a windows share as workspace first simply mount it locally using a command similar to following:\nmount -t smbfs -o username=name,password=password //machinename/sharename /mnt/smbshare\n\nNow you you can use use the folder /mnt/smbshare as your workspace. You dont have to mount it to /mnt/smbshare you can mount it any where you want.\n\nA: Finally found a workaround, without needing to install an additional SMB/CIFS package and/or additional mounts:\nThe GNOME smb shares are always mounted under the home directory:\n~/.gvfs/sharename on 192.168.0.2/sandbox/workspace \n\n(make sure you select it using the browse button, not typing the full path by hand)\nSo simple... :)\n", "Q: Theme changes after resuming from suspend I'm using a Dell Inspiron 1520 and Ubuntu 10.10.

They are needed where multiple key-strokes should result in one letter/character and you need graphical feedback about the selection and confirmation process (e.g. a list to choose from). This is used for Chinese and Japanese, because they have thousands of characters.\nWith normal keyboards languages, like Russian, Greek and all the others which don’t need more than about 100 characters/letters can use other tricks to get to the goal. “Dead keys”, AltGr for example, or simply Shift.\n\nA: IBus has support for the typical languages requiring an IME such as Japanese, Chinese (various) and Korean.

It's even more annoying than Windows's User Accounts Control.\n(Please... I don't need a lecture on how I would be living a dangerous life. Thank you.)\n\nA: I don't see how hard it is to run sudo -i once in a terminal, and then just use this one terminal (or you could open more than one, but then you would have to type your password again) to do all your sudo stuff.\n(And no, I can't really see the big problem in typing your password once in a while.

SUDO is not there to make things compicated. Only reason to make another root account (wether home directory is /root/ or custom directory i.e. /home/root2/) is that there is two administratos in system who does not wish to share one root password.\nOtherwise, use sudo. And assuming you are not seasoned Unix-user, there is also risk you forget what tools are root-only and what is for common users.\nBUT, if you feel that you have secure normal user (i personally use STRONG password with this method), i let my user (i.e. tatu.staff / uid=1xxx, gid 50) run SUDO without password. Therefore I never mix up what is only for root and what's for user. \nUse instructions above to create sudoers file (and corresponding groups) to make specific user to run SUDO without password or see example file i'll paste here: \n#\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\nDefaults        env_reset\nDefaults        mail_badpass\nDefaults        secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\nDefaults        !authenticate\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\nYOURUSER    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n%wheel  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nYOURUSER being your username, that line allowing specific user to run SUDO without password.\nall users in group SUDO need to give password.\nall users in group wheel can run sudo without password -- useful if you want to give passwordless SUDO ACCESS to multiple users, which is by the way, simply put A VERY BAD IDEA.\nALSO: \n- Remember the % charachter before GROUP names. \n- One can edit /etc/group directly, but it is NOT adviced. Use ADDGROUP to edit, see more info by typing: man addgroup\nI must stress again that ALWAYS edit sudoers file by using VISUDO command, NEVER directly with editor. That ensures that you always get valid sudoers file - typing errors or bad statements etc. are very bad thing in such important file, and visudo saves you all that trouble you might not be able recover by yourself, and i bet first answer to question after this is \"always use visdo. didn't they tell you that? oh they did?

This is related to question Why is this bypassing the SUDO password?. In that one of the responders answered the question in an awesome way, and very, very clear to any newbie. Now here is a question that I can't seem to figure. \nI wrote a script for starting the vmware firefox plugin (don't worry. I gave that up and now run vBox very happily. I left vmware for my servers :) )\nI needed to start the plugin as sudo, but I also needed to pass an argument (password) to it, that happened to be the same.\nSo, if my password was Hello123, the command would be: sudo ./myscript.sh hi other Hello123\nRunning from the command line, the script would ask for my sudo password and then run. I wanted to capture that password and pass it as well. I also wanted to run graphically, so I tried gksudo, and there is an option -p that returns the password for variable assignment.\nWell, that was a nightmare because I would still get prompted for the original sudo: see below\nFind UserName\n\nvUser=$USER\nFind password (and hopefully enable sudo)\n\nvP=gksudo -p -D somedescriptiontext echo\nExecute command\n\ngksudo ./myscript.sh hi $vUser $vP\n\nAnd I still get prompted twice.\nSo my question is tri-fold: \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a variable I can use for the password, just like there is one for user, $USER? \n\n*Is there a different way I should be assigning the value resulting of the command I have in $vP? I am wondering if executing the way I have it, does it in an uninitiated session and not the current one, since I am getting some additional warning type errors on some variables.\n\n*I tried using Zenity to just capture the text, but then of course, I couldn't pass that value to sudo, so I could only use it as a parameter, which puts me back in 2 prompts.\n\nA: You can assign certain commands to run without having to provide a password with sudo (man visudo). For example, you might have a line like this, if your username is psusi:\n%psusi ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/myscript.sh\n\nUse extreme caution with granting all-trusting sudo access.\n\nA: The program you're looking for is called expect. You write a script wherein you tell the program to expect certain prompts (such as password prompts) and then supply some response via stdin, the same as with keyboard input. I've used it in the past to get around annoying password prompts that I couldn't (easily) get rid of.\nsudo aptitude install expect\nman expect\n\n\nA: 1) No, since that would give away your password to anyone on your system\n2) The return value from gksudo is an integer indicating whether it had an error or not.  The -p switch has it PRINT the password to its stdout.\n3) Why are you even trying to get the password?  Skip the first call to gksudo and just use the second.\n", "Q: Dual sound from headphones and speakers I have tried everything from this question and this question and I have nothing.

Here is a quesion that has been bugging me. You know how you can set up a program to run on start up right?  Well, how can i tell it to start minimized, like you would do in windows? \nTeamViewer starts open, but I need it minimized, and Tray-it just doesn't seem as elegant of a way to do it.\n\nA: I stumbled across this post with the very same issue of TeamViewer not starting minimized when set up for automatic launch during Ubuntu system startup.\nThe method described by @MJB on Jan 27 at 16:02 worked perfectly for me (I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 32bit, all updates installed up to this date, with teamviewer_linux_x32_v6.0.9224.deb).\nI do not experience the glitches described by @misterben on Feb 14 at 18:50.\nI installed GDevilspie via Ubuntu Software Center, ran it, created a new rule and set up GDevilspie to show the following code in the \"Raw\" tab:\n( if \n( begin \n( is ( application_name ) \"Teamviewer\" )\n( is ( window_name ) \"TeamViewer\" )\n) \n( begin \n( minimize )\n( println \"match\" )\n)\n)\n\nThe devilspie daemon is set to start up automatically during system start and teamviewer is set to start automatically via System --> Preferences --> Startup Applications (click Add, command: teamviewer).\nIt would be great if the developers of TeamViewer would integrate a start minimized switch for linux though...\nThanks MJB! :)\n\nA: Minimizing a program depends on the program if it supports that or not. It also depends if the program has an option in the gui or via command line. For example vlc has an option in preferences that gives the chance to start it minimized. But it also has an option in command line to start it minimized (like parameters). The option to minimize also changes depending of the program. Some programs might be program -min other might be program -systray, etc.. Verify that Teamviewer for example has an option for this in the gui options. If the program has a command line minimize parameter just add it to the start up manager. \n\nA: You can use a tool called devilspie .   \nThis tool can take actions as soon as programs are started, like sending to workspaces, pinning, and also minimizing. A tutorial is here.\n\n\n*\n\n*To install it from the command-line run:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install devilspie.\n\n\n*\n\n*To configure it to minimize Teamviewer everytime it is executed:\nmkdir ~/.devilspie\n\nCreate a file called ~/.devilspie/teamviewer.ds and paste the following lines:\n(if  \n(is (application_name) \"Teamviewer\")  \n(begin (minimize) )  \n)  \n\n\nIf you'd like a gui for easier configuration you should take note of gdevilspie  \n(if GDevilspie not starting try patched one).\n\nA: I'm also minimizing Teamviewer to the tray on startup, but I'm using KDocker.\nsudo apt-get install kdocker\n\nMy startup script is one line:\nkdocker -n Teamviewer -i /opt/teamviewer/teamviewer/7/desktop/teamviewer.png -d 40 /usr/bin/teamviewer7 &\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-n is the name of the window  \n\n*-i is the icon file  \n\n*-d is a 40 second limit, after which kdocker will give up if it can't find a matching window\n\n\nA: Devilspie didn't work in my system for some reason. Eventually, I found a substitute (not so elegant).I installed wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nUsing wmctrl -l found the names of the windows, I wanted to close on startup. After that, put those command into script (create new empty file and name it .<...>.sh. Dot at the beginning of the name to hide it):\nwmctrl -c <Window_1>\nwmctrl -c <Window_2>\nwmctrl -c <Window_3>\n\nFinally, added this file to the startup applications couple of seconds after the targets.\n\nNote, that this command closes windows. To start program minimized, on different workspace ets, find appropriate options in the program manual.\n\nA: Since Teamviewer 8.0.20931 there is automatically minimize to system tray function. But in Gnome classic it will create Wine System Tray and I do not know, how to minimize it. I tried the script (saved as ~/.devilspie/wine.ds):\n( if \n( begin \n( is ( application_name ) \"Wine\" )\n( is ( window_name ) \"Wine System Tray\" )\n) \n( begin \n( minimize )\n( println \"match\" )\n)\n)\n\n... but it did not work\nWith new Teamviewer 8.0.20931 for Linux even log in onto Linux login screen works - when no user is not logged in yet. But after some time when you log in and out twice or so - you cannot connect to Teamviewer. You need to have remote access over command line to do restart to computer - then it works again.\n\nA: 2017 working solution!\nI am coming from Manjaro (XFCE) edition, but since this is cross-linux solution with devilspie, so this is the complete solution on starting team viewer minimized:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*Install devilspie package:\napt-get install devilspie\n\n\n*Create home folder:\nmkdir ~/.devilspie\n\n\n*Create the following script (use any editor you want instead of nano):\nnano ~/.devilspie/teamviewer.ds\n\n\n*Paste the following script and save file (for nano - CTRL+x, then Y, Then ENTER):\n( if\n( begin\n( is (application_name) \"Teamviewer\")\n( is (window_name) \"TeamViewer\")\n)\n( begin (close) )\n)\n\n\n\n*From the devilspie perspective all steps are done, but \"Computers & Contacts\" side window will still be shown on each startup. To hide it, open the:\n\n\n\nTeamViewer --> Extras --> Options --> Advanced --> \"Show advanced options\" --> \"Show Computers & Contacts on startup\" (It's under \"Advanced settings for Computers and Contacts section) and uncheck it.\nSteps are for TeamViewer 12. In further versions they might be different.\nNOTE:\nUsing (minimize) instead of (close) in devilspie script brought me \"TeamViewer not ready.

This assumes you have admin access to the windows machine... wich you would have needed for an apt-cacher service install anyway.\nYour other option is to do an apt mirror, this involves downloading the entire ubuntu archive onto your local computer (about 3GB) which you can host from windows via apache. You can then point your Ubuntu machine at it.\n\nA: Another option is to use apt-offline or apt-offline-gui.\nPre-requistes: A friend's system with Internet connection. apt-offline installed in both your systems.\nThe Offline installation is achieved in 3 simple steps.\nStep 1:\nGenerate a signature file on the Disconnected Debian box at home\napt-offline set /tmp/apt-offline.sig\nThe above command will generate all information required from apt about updating its database.\nStep 2:\nDownload data based on the signature file generated earlier\napt-offline get C:\\apt-offline.sig --threads 5\nThe above command will download data as mentioned in the signature file. To speed up downloads (that can be from multiple apt repositories), in this example we spawn 5 download threads.\nOnce completed, you could just copy the data (an archive file, if you used the --bundle option) back to the removable medium and copy it back onto your offline host.\nStep 3:\nOnce you're back upon the home Debian machine, you feed the data from the removable medium to apt-offline:\napt-offline install /media/USB/apt-offline.zip\nThis will update the APT database on your disconnected machine seamlessly.\nApt-offline can be even be used in Windows systems. In my opinion, apt-offline is the best option for Offline installation.\nSource\n\nA: You can either setup a proxy on windows (probably http://serverfault.com has some suggestions) or, if you don't mind the resource usage, install andLinux to have ubuntu run as a background process on your windows installation and use the usual ubuntu apt-caching\n\nA: Another option would be to try Keryx which will allow you to manage packages on your offline Ubuntu computer using your online Windows computer's internet connection and a flash drive.

After attempting to install quickly with:\nsudo apt-get install quickly python-quickly-widgets\n\nI got a postfix (mail daemon) configuration screen. Why do I need it to use quickly and how should I configure it? I read/write mail on my browser (gmail...).\n\nA: Postfix is a mail transfer agent, it's used to send email from within your computer system (email is inherently built into every unix-like operating system). This is sometimes used to record notifications for system administrators (i.e. an email to the 'root' user account) and things like that.\n\nIn short, you can safely select No Configuration. You absolutely don't need to worry about it. \nThe reason why postfix was configured was that bsd-mailx depends on it, which in turn is a dependency of devscripts, which is installed as part of the debian build system.\n", "Q: App Inventor for the Ubuntu platform? Will Ubuntu have something like Google App Inventor to easily develop applications for the Ubuntu platform? Is Quickly intended to do that? I heard Ubuntu is planing to make easy and fun to develop for Ubuntu platform. How is it going to be accomplished?\n\nA: Developing for Ubuntu comprises a number of sections which it's important to think about as separate but associated elements:\nProject Creation\nWhen starting off a brand new project there will always be a set of best practices to follow and easiest routes to take. These are codified in the quickly project which provides a set of instant use templates for various languages and coding problems. Right now I believe templates exist for python, vala and pygame.\nProject Management\nUbuntu platform uses the launchpad service in order to provide a place online where code can be shared, bugs can be tracked and other project management tasks can easily be performed. This service is where translations are done, teams are set up and even support questions are asked.\nYou can integrate project management into your desktop work flow using a range of tools. From the fancy GUI GroundControl to command line tools for tracking bugs and running reports.\nCode Management\nThe source contents of a project in Ubuntu are normally stored in a bazaar branch. These branches are generally files with your project in launchpad, but they don't have to be. There are some pretty extensive tools on the Ubuntu platform for dealing with code branches, everything from the bzr command itself to bzr-gtk and the aforementioned GroundControl.\nPublishing\nThis is the last step in the process and it allows you to get your app to more users, for testing and for true distribution. First it's a matter of creating viable deb packages, there are various guides on how to make Debian packages; but the aforementioned quickly creates the standard templates for you to work from.\nThe launchpad ppa system was developed to allow quick distribution channels without too much checking or verification. Your Debian packages can be submitted to launchpad under any person or group that you have ownership or membership in.\nHowever the best route to take is to take your packages to the Debian project where they will be submitted for review and if they pass can be uploaded directly into the Debian repository and available in the next version of Ubuntu. There are a host of tools for helping with this process, but it's not yet as easy as the other steps mentioned above.\n\nA: Illumination Software Creator \nThis is a proprietary commercial application that costs $39.85 US (available from Ubuntu Software Centre) and seems to be offering what you are looking for. As far as I can tell, it is a GUI where you set out a flow chart of user interactions.\nI would recommend you try quickly. It allows you to easily create applications. It generates a project template containing much of the required boilerplate code that you can then edit. It allows you to design the user interface in Glade, a graphical designer.\n\nQuickly also handles packaging and uploading to PPAs.\n\nA: Ubuntu probably won't include App Inventor by default, but is far as i can see on the setup page, Ubuntu is supported, and it even has a deb package.\nAs far as the Ubuntu strategy for development, I'm not too sure. My guess is Python. You should submit this as a separate question.\n", "Q: Docky have stopped working since update I'm using the Docky ppa, and since the latest update it won't start.

I also downloaded the source but it uses something called cmake, never used it before. Is it similar to make?\n\nA: In your case you have indeed version 1.0.0 of the library.\nIn general when you want to develop using a library, you have to get the corresponding -dev package which contains the header files. In this case libcv-dev. It will also install the library itself, which may have different version numbers depending on the soname - no need to install it separately.\nIn this case there is also a opencv-doc package, which contains some example programs, and which is worth installing.\nIf you want to build the library itself from source, you can run sudo apt-get build-dep opencv to get all the required libraries and header files to build opencv. \nBuilding indeed uses cmake.

I am considering buying \"Ubuntu Desktop Support\" from Canonical for 2 reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a couple of issues that I would like professional help with. (Specifically a recurring kernel panic, and a slow wireless connection.)\n\n*I would like to lend a helping hand toward supporting Ubuntu financially.\n\n\nHowever, I am a bit worried that once I transfer the money, they will end up just referring me to the bug tracker on Launchpad.  \nAlso, free support options like this site have the pleasant property that they are open to the internet, meaning that if my issue gets fixed, it is more likely to help others with the same problem.\nWhat does paying for support from Canonical actually get you?\n\nA: When I was an inexperienced ubuntuuser I chose to buy support from Canonical. I run Ubuntu on my business pc too, so I had to be absolutely sure that I would never be alone with a problem, and with Canonical I wasn't. They turned out to be very persistent, and wouldn't leave me alone till the problem was solved :o)\n\nA: So, I did end up buying desktop support from Canonical.  After I placed my order, I was able to log into Canonical's support system ( which they call \"Landscape\" ) within a couple of days ( they sent me an email once my account had been activated ).  I am able to log into Landscape using my existing Launchpad account.  There is nothing much I can do on Landscape's main site, since I only bought desktop support.  But, I can click on through to \"Support\", and then on through to \"viewing or filing a support case\", from where all my communications with Canonical's analysts take place.  Luckily, this link is bookmarkable, although you do have to log in every time.  The support cases themselves are not hosted on Canonical's servers, but rather on salesforce.com .  \nAt the time of this writing, I have filed about 19 cases.  Of those 19 cases, somewhere between 20 and 30 percent of those cases were either resolved by me, of were not resolved to my satisfaction, sometimes because it is a known bug, and sometimes because of my hardware.  Canonical's analysts are upfront about the fact that they can not solve every problem, that when a system is not certified for Ubuntu, all they can do is provide a \"best effort\".  I was advised several times to file a bug on Launchpad.  Canonical's analysts did provide help by filing and updating these bugs.  Canonical does make good on their promise that all support requests are responded to within 2 business days.  This can be slightly annoying, because the weekends are often my prime time for working on my Ubuntu systems, and this means I sometimes have to wait till Monday to hear back.  I do ( of course ) NOT expect Canonical's analysts to work on the weekends.\nI have interacted with about half a dozen of Canonical's analysts.  Every time one of my support cases gets closed ( either at my request, or because there has not been any activity on my case for more than 3 days ), I receive an email inviting me to take a survey of less than 10 questions about how satisfied I was with the support I received, and how likely I am to renew my subscription based on this case.  You can ignore these invitations if you want, Canonical will not nag you about them.  However, they do come in handy.  One time, an analyst got impatient with me, and I noted this in the corresponding survey.  Thereupon, I received an email from that analysts manager, to sort out what happened.  So, those surveys definitely do get read.\nOften times ( when I file a support case ), I will be asked to download and run a script provided to me by Canonical.  This is a shell script, so you can look at it and see what it does.  It collects information about my system, and writes that information to a compressed file in my /tmp/ directory.  I can then upload this file to my case to get further help.\nI do plan on extending my subscription to Canonical support.  I like having a go-to person when I run into trouble.  I was even able to get help with fixing a system which is not my own.  Apparently, desktop support is not limited in terms of how many machines you can get help with.  Even with its shortcomings, I consider Canonical's desktop support a pretty good deal.\n\nA: I've no experience with canonical support. But the features look promising and the one year package has a fair price, so i guess you couldn't do something wrong by subscribing.\nAs described on the features page this should be the relevant part for your needs.\nSystem support\n\n\n*\n\n*...\n\n*Problem identification, assessment and bug reporting.\n\n*\nProviding a work-around or complete resolution.\n\n", "Q: How to install jmol?

I want to convert these files to a more modern format because the Totem Movie Player that comes with Ubuntu 10.4 seems to be the only program capable of playing them. \nThe files seem to be encoded with a MJPEG codec, and playing them in VLC or Windows Media Player plays only the sound but there is no video.\nAvidemux was able to open the files, but the quality of the video is severely degraded: The video skips frames and is interlaced (it's not interlaced when playing it in Totem). \nNeither ffmpeg nor mencoder seems to be able to read the video stream. mencoder reports that it is using ffmpeg's codec.

Should I install them through apt-get or should I let easy_install/pip fetch them from PyPi?\n\nA: There are several arguments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Repositories/PPAs because they will keep you both stable and up to date with security fixes.\nThis is mostly true. If, for example, you install python-django as I have, you get security updates. This is good because you only have to keep on top of apt but you still have to test things before you push updates (although testing should be fine each time).\nYou could argue that if you used pip, you might never check for updates.\n\n*Use pip so you can use the proper \"stable\" versions.\nThere's no doubt about it: The repos lag behind the real world. Django is 2.0 but the repos for the LTS version of Ubuntu (that a lot of people stick with for servers) you only get 1.8 on Ubuntu 16.4 lts with Python 2 but still get security updates on it.\npip gives you the latest all the time. You just have to update them yourself.\n\n*Upgrading a repo-used Python install can be a nightmare\nWhen you dist-upgrade Ubuntu to the next version, it upgrades a lot of packages. Lots of things change. I know in Django this means you have to take care to watch out for code-incompatibilities, deprecations... But the same applies to all other Python code.\nThe same is true for pip but with pip you get to do one thing at a time. You know what causes the problems so you know where to look to find the fix.\n\n*pip+virtualenv lets you keep things separate\nvirtualenv lets you have portable, little Python environments. This allows you to have several different Python environments running alongside each other on the same machine.\nThe obvious boon seems to be for maintenance as you can manage the environment in the same way as you manage the code. Even store the environment in the VCS too... but you should remember that having twelve different virtualenvs means twelve environments you need to check on and update.\n\nEdit: After a horrible series of upgrades on a server to get it from Lucid to Precise, I've switched from a mixed Apt+pip (nr 1 and 2) to a pure pip+virtualenv (nr. 4) situation. Instead of having one virtualenv per site, I've got one shared one between a dozen-or-so sites. This is working for now.\nI've also had to write a little script that checks the status of packages installed with pip. If there are updates I have to apply them manually (which is good because I test them locally, in a local virtualenv). This is all still a little more painful than it was originally but much better in the long run.\n\nA: *\n\n*Packages from the repositories\nThese should be installed whenever your application is in some way specific to Ubuntu. They guarantee you a stable version that you can install across Ubuntu machines, they are supported and sometimes more mature than the one's you get via pip. If you deploy a bunch of ubuntu servers, or if you're writing an Ubuntu applications, use these, if available.\nThey also sometimes contain Ubuntu-specific modifications.\n\n*pip vs easy_install\nTheres not much to say about those, as Django hacker James Bennett put it:\n\nPlease, for the love of Guido, stop using setuptools and easy_install, and use distutils and pip instead.\n\nFor an in-depth discussion on the differences, see On packaging by James Bennett (of django) and A Few Corrections To “On Packaging” by Ian Bicking (of mozilla).\nIf you want to be safe, try out your pip deployments using virtualenv. This gives you an isolated python environment, so you can be sure that your app will run on any machine.\nWait a bit though, I trust some people will disagree with me.\n", "Q: Font rendering in Firefox is blurry A picture is worth a thousand words... so does anyone know how to fix this font blurriness in Firefox?\n(You'll need to right-click the picture below go to View Image to view it full-size; it's too small to see anything here.)\n\nNote: My other applications (and the Firefox non-client area, as you can see in the screen) are completely fine, so obviously going to System->Appearance and changing the font settings isn't fixing the situation.\n\nEdit:\nNot letting web pages to use their own fonts also doesn't help:\n\nSee how the upper one is still sharper?\nAlso, Firefox's own menu bar doesn't render the same way as the page content (menu bar below, page content above). They're both Segoe UI:\n\n\nA: All right, I found the solution:\nIt was all because I was using the Segoe UI Light font everywhere in the system, but Firefox was using Segoe UI Regular. By (hackishly) changing the font in About:Config, I managed to get it to look almost the way I wanted... but now, the font spacing is too low and things are squished together.\nIf anyone knows how to increase the spacing, that would be fantastic! :)\n\nA: This might also happen due non-availability of MicroSoft fonts. Install MScoreture fonts.\nsudo apt-get install msttcorefonts\n\nA: Linux and Windows render fonts differently, so you can't expect to have same font in Windows and Ubuntu rendered the same. This is also an issue on Mac, and there are lots of articles around discussing the difference.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/12.html\n\n*http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/06/font-rendering-respecting-the-pixel-grid.html\nGenerally, this Wikipedia article is a good starting point for reading\nIf you are bothered, you can play with \"Hinting\" section in Gnome appearance settings (Font tab).\nPS: To illustrate the fact that this is not Firefox issue, here's a screenshot I made in gEdit, using Arial 10pt font. You will see that it's rendered exactly the same as in Firefox screenshot you've posted:\n\nAnother screenshot, now gedit and FF side-by-side:\n\n\nA: I think you've answered your own question now (that the two screenshots are showing different fonts/weights)!\nThe main lesson here is that currently Firefox does its own thing with font rendering and doesn't pick up the same font preferences set in GNOME or KDE.  There's bug #621198 (\"Check+Harmonise X/Fontconfig/Gtk+/Firefox/Chromium/Konq/Qt/KDE rendering preferences\") to try and fix that.\nOn the subject of font rendering preferences themselves; it's very subjective.  A low-resolution display (as compared to a 600 DPI laser-printer) does not have sufficient pixels to render the glyphs in their original form.  The choices are either to anti-alias/grayscale the text, or to intentionally distort the text to fit the pixel-grid (called \"hinting\").\n\n*\n\n*Geometric accuracy (aka \"blurry\") is the Mac OSX historic default\n\n*In the middle (aka \"slight hinting\") is the Ubuntu historic default\n\n*Fully hinted (aka \"sharp\") is the MS Windows historic default\n\nPeople tend to prefer what they're used to; it's possible to argue equally that each is better/worse than the others.  Ubuntu ships with a default in the middle of the two extremes applying a default of hinting in the vertical direction only.\nIn addition, most platforms now use sub-pixel rendering, which makes use of knowledge of the orientation and physical characteristics of the monitor to attempt to display more detail in the letters—at the cost of colour fringing.  You can configure all of these settings under Ubuntu to your own liking, but you are currently required to apply them again for Firefox/Chromium until the bug above is fixed.\n\nA: I've been trying to fix this problem for two years now, and my only solution has been to force Firefox to use my selected fonts. Not ideal, but better than the Firefox defaults. And the thing that drives me completely insane is that, if you install Opera under Linux and compare its font rendering with the same page in Firefox under Windows, the pages look virtually identical.\nI've asked before, and I'll ask again here and now: How is it that Firefox can get it right in Windows, and Opera can get it right under Linux, but Firefox can't get it right under Linux?\nGiven that Opera gets it right, I'd say this ISN'T an issue with system fonts, especially since I have a complete set of Microsoft TTF fonts installed on my Linux box. The web page tells the browser what fonts to use and the browser should use them - if Opera can find and use them on my system, FF should too. This is a FIREFOX BUG, I reported it to them a long time ago, and after at least two years it's way past time they got their act together and fixed it.\n\nA: Make sure there is no zoom active (ctrl + 0)\n\nA: Have you tried swapping in the .fonts.conf file found at the bottom of this page on the Ubuntu Wiki.\nHere's a description of the problem, which sounds like yours:\n\nI'm currently working on font settings\n  in XML (.fonts.conf). I noticed that\n  after installing msttcorefonts things\n  don't look quite as good in Firefox\n  anymore. Most web pages request Arial\n  which doesn't get hinted and\n  anti-aliased too nicely, especially on\n  LCD screens. I personally prefer the\n  \"sharp\" non-anti-aliased look. I also\n  noticed that many users coming from\n  Windows® ask on the forums about\n  getting fonts to look that way.\n\n\nA: Well, I deleted .font_config and rebooted. Seems to fix the problem.\nEdit from comment:\nFinally! Found a solution that works for me. Seems the problem is with the Ubuntu font family. I went to System>Preferences>Appearance>Fonts and changed the fonts to something else than Ubuntu's own, eg. Sans, serif etc etc. Hopefully this will work for you guys too. – Atle Jul 11 '11 at 18:25\n", "Q: What is the difference between gksudo and gksu? Is there any difference between the behavior of gksu foo and gksudo foo? \nCan they be used interchangeably? \n\nA: Both files point to the same place:\n$ ls -l /usr/bin/gksudo \nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 2010-09-27 18:23 /usr/bin/gksudo -> gksu\n\n... gksudo is symlinked to gksu. But this doesn't mean they do the same things, far from it.\nApplications can detect the command used to run it. This is typically argv[0] in C-style languages or $0 in Bourne-style shell scripts. The application can look at that and in this case, actually it changes how it works. The first indication of this is in the man gksu page:\ngksu  is  a  frontend  to  su  and gksudo is a frontend to sudo.\n\nIf you look in the source (apt-get source gksu) for run_mode, you'll see how it detects this:\n  { /* support gksu_sudo_run */\n    gchar *myname = g_path_get_basename (argv[0]);\n    if (!strcmp(myname, \"gksudo\"))\n      run_mode = SUDO_MODE;\n    g_free (myname);\n  }\n\nYou can override this with the --su-mode/-w and --sudo-mode/-S arguments (so you can run equivalent commands without needing the gksudo symlink... But that's up to you.\nIf you want to know how these \"modes\" really differ, there's only a bit of escaping in gksu. You need to follow it into libgksu. This is the library that actually checks permissions before handing off to the system.\nIf no mode is specified (eg you call gksu without arguments) by the time it reaches  libgksu, it will check Gconf (as Stefano points out) and if it still can't decide, it'll default to the su mode.\n\nA: In Ubuntu (!), there is no difference.\n\n\n*\n\n*gksu would normally log in the root user and run an app on this session. However, on Ubuntu, it defaults to using the \"sudo mode\", which is equivalent of running gksudo. This is because on ubuntu, you can't log in as root by default.\n\n*gksudo is the graphical equivalent of sudo (and as Oli points out, just a symbolic link to gksu)\nFrom the gconf entry of gksu:\n\nFurthermore, on the difference between sudo and gksudo:\n\nYou should never use normal sudo to start graphical applications as root. You should use gksudo (kdesudo on Kubuntu) to run such programs. gksudo sets HOME=~root, and copies .Xauthority to a tmp directory. This prevents files in your home directory becoming owned by root. (AFAICT, this is all that's special about the environment of the started process with gksudo vs. sudo). — (from the community documentation via Chris Wilson)\n\n\nA: I know that this is an old thread, but I've been asked to tell you about a subtle but essential difference between gksu and gksudo.\nAlthough I have looked long and hard, I cannot find a documented difference anywhere, and yet it does exist. I have also not found out why there is a difference. I found this the hard way when I accidentally deleted some system files precisely because of this difference (discussed in a thread in Ubuntu Forums) — I had been using gksu, but since then I have made sure always to use gksudo.\nTo summarise, try this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create three files in some folder:\ntouch abc\ntouch abc.tmp\ntouch abctmp\n\n*Run the following six commands.

I am looking for a similar publishing tool in Ubuntu or Windows. I would prefer a open source alternative. \nRegards\nKiran\n\nA: Scribus is the most popular open source desktop publishing application, it is available from the software center.\n\nA: That O'Reilly series of books uses lots of illustration, diagrams and fancy fonts. You need a full-blown DTP application for that - only Scribus comes to mind. Chances are O'Reilly use the proprietary InDesign application. For a full book, Scribus might not be powerful enough (although it is worth a try). Something simpler might be accomplished with OpenOffice.org.\nLess graphically complex documents can be typeset with LaTeX. With LaTeX, some things - like good-looking type - are easy, but some other things - like pixel-perfect tables - are hard to get right without lots of programming.

Feel free to chip in and help.\n\nA: It looks like packetfence and it's related modules, needs to be packages for Debian. This isn't a hard job, since a lot of the modules are available with standard perl installers. But it would require each module to be built.\nOnce you've got a nice package of packetfence made up, you can apply the patch suggested in the tutorial which enables apache2 configuration.\nI think that the web interface for packetfence needs upgrading to work with apache2 if it doesn't already work. This probably requires the attention of a developer.\nDon't be shy asking for (or paying for) developers and packagers to help you get this installable for everyone. It's obviously something that needs doing:\nhttp://www.debian-administration.org/articles/78\n", "Q: How to sync Google Docs with a folder in my filesystem?

I have a rather long spreadsheet with historical information of issues solved by some user on a collaborative environment. \nThe spreadsheet have the following (relevant) columns\ndate, week no., project, author id, etc...\nThe week no. is calculated from the date, is basically the year concatenated with the week number within that year; for instance, both 2009-02-18 and 2009-02-20 yield the week number 200908 - the 8th week of year 2009; and 2009-02-23 yields 200909 - the 9th week of year 2009.\nI need to count how many different users (given by author id) contributed to some project, on a weekly basis.\nI have setup a data pilot with the week as Row Field, the project as the Column Field, and count-author as the Data Field. However, this counts the author id as different instances. This is not what I need. I need to count how many different users contributed to each project on a weekly basis.\nI expect to get something like:\n        projects\nweek    Project1   Project2   Project3\n200901        10          2          \n200902         2                     7\n\nEach inner cell containing how many different users contributed.

I run a few Ubuntu servers that have a load of django sites running on them. The sites and the httpd start at boot and after that (apart from me SSHing in to update it or using bzr to update websites) nothing else gets run on it.\nAt the moment over half the ram is allocated as cache. This isn't a problem because cache usually makes space or a little bit of it slips into swap (again, this doesn't really bother me) but I don't see the need for it.\nIs there a quick way to disable the cache? This is more of an experiment than anything else so it would be handy to know how to turn it back on again.\n\nA: This blog post by Andrea Righi suggests that there isn't a config option in the kernel, but it also sketches out a little glibc wrapper library to just set the O_DIRECT flag on every call to open().\nThis should have the same effect as disabling the read-buffer completely. \nAdditionally, the OpenOffice wiki has a couple of methods to do cold-start testing. This isn't what you want, but I thought I include it anyway.\n\nA: since 2.6.16 you can run:\nsync ; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\n\nA: No, and you don't want to.  The cache only uses memory that otherwise would be sitting idle.  As soon as it is needed, it will be freed and given to the process that wants it, so you can consider cache memory to be free, which is why the free command prints a line with the cache factored in.\n", "Q: Cannot mount a CIFS network share over VPN I have setup u VPN connection to our Windows 2008 server at the office and it seems to work fine.\nFor some reason, however, I still am not able to access the network shares over a VPN connection using my standard fstab entries.

Use domain of your remote VPN server instead vpndomain.local\n\nA: You need a way to resolve the server name.  When you are connected locally this can be done with the cifs broadcast name resolution service, but this does not work over a vpn or other routed connection.  If the host name can not be resolved by your DNS server then you either need to use the IP address in your fstab, or add an entry to /etc/hosts.\n\nA: I was finally able to solve this problem; I believe it was caused by an IP conflict.\nBoth my home network range as my office range used the 192.168.1.0 range; I changed my home range to 10.0.0.0 and voila!\nAdditionally, I added 192.168.1.0 with netmask 255.255.255.0 as a local route to the VPN and checked 'use VPN only for routes on its network'.\n", "Q: Why is it taking so long to open the Ubuntu Help Center?

However, Calibri appears as a bitmap font in a lot of the sizes that it appears. How do I tell fontconfig to forbid Calibri (and Cambria,etc.) from being rendered from the embedded bitmaps? I already have 70-no-bitmaps.conf in my /etc/fonts/conf.d/ directory.\nThe fonts in question can be extracted from the PowerPoint Viewer.\n\nA: /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf only rejects bitmap fonts, they don't disable embedded bitmaps, which is the case here. I don't know why they didn't put the setting to disable embedded bitmaps in the same conf file. Anyways, put the following in your ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/20-no-embedded.conf (or, for older versions of Ubuntu, in ~/.fonts.conf.d/20-no-embedded.conf):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n  <match target=\"font\">\n    <edit name=\"embeddedbitmap\" mode=\"assign\">\n      <bool>false</bool>\n    </edit>\n  </match>\n</fontconfig>\n\nThis will disable embedded bitmap for all fonts.

Back up any important data NOW.  Then run the disk utility and click the SMART diagnostics.  Run the long self test, and when that finishes, look at the values of the following attributes:\nOffline_Uncorrectable\nCurrent_Pending_Sector\nReallocated_Sector_Ct\nIf the uncorrectable count is non zero, or the reallocated or pending counts are more than a few, you need to replace the drive.  If there are only a few pending, then you can attempt to repair them.  First you need to identify the number of the bad sector.  The badblocks utility can be used for this.  Then you can use hdparm --read-sector to try reading from it to make sure you have the right one, and then hdparm --write-sector to try and rewrite the sector with zeros.  That will force the drive to try to correct the sector, or if it can not, will reallocate it from the spare pool, moving a count from the pending_sectors to reallocated.  Repeat for all bad sectors.\n\nA: This is what actually made me solve my problem. The response of psusi really helped, however it was really too rough for me and I spent something like three hours to get it all and to extract what would be interesting for me from his post. I had to search in Wikipedia, the official Ubuntu Forums and Ask Ubuntu. As a consequence I consider his post as a welcomed hint but not as the right answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Ubuntu on a Live-CD.\n\n*Using System -> Administration -> Gparted, disable the eventual swap partition (in other words, \"swapoff\"). Besides, note down the name of your corrupted drive, in my case \"sda\"\n\n*In a terminal, run the command sudo badblocks -sv -b 512 <device-name>, where  in my case is to be replaced by /dev/sda. After a long time waiting, the result is a list of numbers which are the corrupted sectors.\n\n*Run the command sudo dd if=<device-name> of=/dev/null bs=512 count=1 skip=<sector>, where I replaced  by dev/sda and  by 385850816, the first number given by the previous command.\n\n*Repeat the previous point for each number.\n\n*To check if your rescue succeeded, run again the command sudo badblocks -sv -b 512 <device-name>. It should give (after a long while) no number.\n\n\nAs far as I am concerned, it solved my problem, and I was able again to move my partition. I have to admit I don't really know why, since the commands here-upon seem to be only read and to write commands. But whatever, I encounter no problem any more. \n\nA: It seems like there is a hardware issue with your hard disk, so I suggest you use something like ddrescue or gddrescue to make a copy of it on a different hard disk.

Has anyone been able to use any M-Audio midi devices successfully? (the box says Mac only). I am using an M-Audio KeyStudio 25.\n\nA: You can usually check compatibility with devices on the alsa-project's main site:\nhttp://alsa-project.org/\nI couldn't find the keystudio on there. If this keyboard does not work then you could use the MIDI out port (it seems it has one) with a compatible MIDI out->USB device (The M-Audio Uno is one supported device, ~20 dollars).\nOf course, with any sort of audio product on unsupported Operating Systems the best course of action is to see if you can test it out beforehand to make sure it does indeed work or not.\nYou can see what's plugged in your USB devices by issuing the command \"lsusb\" in a terminal. If the keystudio (or something similar) is listed then you may have a pretty good chance of compatibility.\n", "Q: How to join a Windows Domain and Map Network Drives? I just installed the current build for Ubuntu on a partition for my work computer. I am a novice when it comes to Linux/Ubuntu, which is why I installed it along side windows. I want to learn how to operate and use Ubuntu much more than I do now, so I figured installing it and trying to do day to day functions here would be a \"Thrown into the pool with sharks\" way to do it, and I like that way.\nI did however have a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*We are on a Domain in Windows, is there any way to join that domain using the Ubuntu partition?\n\n*We Also have 16 mapped network drives. I don't actually need ALL of them mapped for Ubuntu, but is there a way to Map at least one of them to see/use here in Ubuntu.\n\n*Outlook Corporate email, how can I sign in/use it while...well, you get the idea.\n\n\nAs I said earlier, I am VERY new to Ubuntu, i've only played around with it a bit at home and never at the office. If you could simplify it down for me a bit, that would be great.\n\nA: Here goes!\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows Domain - A popular solution for adding an Ubuntu machine to a Windows domain is Likewise-Open, found here: http://www.likewise.com/products/likewise_open/ It's quite possible that there are other alternatives out there; this was the first one I stumbled upon.\n\n*Mapping Drives - As to mapping drives, Ubuntu has the functionality already built in. Just go to the \"start\" menu, go to \"Places,\" and select \"Connect to Server...\" In the dialog, make sure you select \"Windows share\" from the \"Service type\" drop-down box, and then fill in the rest of the info.\n\n*Outlook E-mail - The already-installed Evolution Mail application should be what you're looking for. Now, there's funny business afoot with Microsoft Exchange servers, so if your company uses one for its mail, you may or may not run into problems (it depends on the version of the server, amongst other things). From the Exchange section of the Evolution documentation: \"Evolution Exchange works only with Exchange 2000 and later, and requires that Outlook Web Access be enabled. Each user needs a valid Microsoft Exchange server account, including a license.\" On the other hand, if your company uses standard IMAP/POP mail, you shouldn't have any trouble. (And perhaps someone more knowledgeable than myself can chime in about that Exchange stuff; I'm terribly behind the times with mail clients!)\n\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: For the Outlook E-mail problem it is also possible to use DavMail ( http://davmail.sourceforge.net/ ) in combination with Thunderbird. It works great if your company is using Exchange. \nFor this also Outlook Web Access must be enabled.\nI used Evolution myself, but it crashed a lot. I had lots of problems. Since I use DavMail with Thunderbird I don't have any problems anymore.\nIf you use the extensions \"Lightning\" and \"Inverse SOGo Connector\" you can also use the Calendar and Contacts.

If I look on Ubuntu One, under notes, these notes do not show in the left pane but show under recent activity. eg \"# (Untitled 10) was updated\"\nHow can I delete these notes and clean up my tomboy app?\nThanks\n\nA: You have edited template notes as if they were regular notes.  Template notes are hidden from the main UI and cannot be deleted.  Ubuntu One used to show them (bug), which is probably how you got into this situation.\nYou should delete the .note files for the template notes that are bothering you.  lepe pointed out the note directory.  Just make sure to delete these files while Tomboy is not running.\nFWIW, we are working on making template notes a little more obvious and a lot more flexible, as you're not the first person to run into this problem.\n\nA: Your notes should be located at:\n~/.local/share/tomboy/\n\nor (older versions)\n~/.tomboy/\n\nOther way could be to purge \"tomboy\" and install it again.\n", "Q: Will it be possible to autohide indicators in some way in the future? Currently I have way to many indicators/icons on my system tray.

Perhaps take a look at the Design guidelines to work out which ones these are.\n(This is my personal view, I'm not sure how it tallies with the view of the Ayatana team.)\n", "Q: How to debug bash script? Is there any way to debug bash script without using echo and logging?\nI'm talking about using breakpoints and stuff like that.\n\nA: shellcheck is the best in the town --\nhttp://www.shellcheck.net/\nyou can also integrate with vim, here is the git repo --\nhttps://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck\n\nA: You can use this small function to drop into \"console\":\nfunction debug\n{\n    echo \"#############|  Entering DEBUG mode  |####################\";\n    cmd=\"\"\n    while [[ $cmd != \"exit\" ]]; do\n        read -p \"> \" cmd\n        case \"$cmd\" in\n            vars ) ( set -o posix ; set );;\n            exit ) ;;\n            * ) eval \"$cmd\";;\n        esac\n    done\n    echo \"#############|  End of DEBUG mode |####################\";\n}\n\nThen, inside your script (EXAMPLE):\nfor file in *; do\n...\n   if [[ $file == \"strange_case.txt\" ]]; then\n       # break the code here to analyze:\n       debug\n   fi\n...\ndone\n\nIt will accept any command, keeping local variables intact. To exit \"debug\" mode, type \"exit\" (it won't exit the script) and it will continue with the code. If you use \"debug\" inside a loop, it will stop each time. You can wrap it inside an \"if\" (as in the example above), or create a \"watch\" function:\nfunction debug_watch\n{\n    if [[ $1 == $2 ]]; then\n        debug\n    fi\n}\n\n# And Use it:\n\ndebug_watch \"$file\" \"strange_case.txt\"\n\nI also added \"vars\" command which will dump all the available variables and their values. You can add your own customized commands as well.\nI did the code in few minutes so use it under your own risk. Be aware that in debug mode any command can be executed, so it poses a security risk if you leave it in a production script.\n\nA: There several different ways, i.e.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run your script with the -x option\nbash -x yourscript.sh\n\n\n*Add set -x in a new line at the beginning of your scriptfile after the Shebang #!/bin/bash and before the beginning of your script, set -v would display the shell input lines, set -x displays the executed commands and arguments\n\n*replace the shebang of your script file with #!/bin/bash -xv\n\nA: Yes, there is Bash Debugger Project.\n\nYou can also use set -x and set -v at execution. More info:\nhttp://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/advanced_bash_scripting_guide/debugging.html\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/debugging-shell-script.html\nGood luck!\n\nA: To the tune of what NES is saying there are set flags in bash to allow for debugging.\nThe set -x flag may be set and unset either from the terminal, or from within your script.\nUsing + or -: \n#!/bin/bash\n#fileinfo\nls -l $1\nset -x      # start debugging here\nwc -l $1\nset +x      # stop debugging here\nfile $1\nset -v      # start verbose output\nw | more    \necho \"\"\necho -n \"Number of users: \"\nset +v      # end verbose output\nwho | wc -l\n\nHere is what the set commands do:\n\n\n*\n\n*set -f      Disable file name generation using metacharacters.\n\n*set -v      Prints (verbose) shell input lines as they are read.\n\n*set -x      Print command traces before executing command.\n\n\nset actually has many features, but woefully no man page as it is a shell built in tool. The manual for set is in the GNU Bash documentation.\nThere are numerous command line tools which could help you gain details about your program like: \n\n\n*\n\n*stat     display file or file system status \n\n*file     determine a file type.\n\n*hexdump  filter which displays the specified files in a variety of formats\n\n*nohup    Run a script that wont hang\nand numerous others. I was trying to think of the command that shows hidden characters, but I cant do it right now. Hexdump will do it but there is a better one.\nThe key command ctrl\\ will cause a running program or script to core dump. Then you could analyze the coredump. I would probably use gdb to analyze a coredump, but many programs exist for that. \nThe bash shell has some nifty options for debugging too.\noptions --debugger, -v verbose, --dump-strings and other nifty options to assist you. Check them out using man bash.\nThe trap command (shell built in) could be very helpful for you. trap says if your program exits unexpectedly, execute something. You read about trap, and other handy Bash Shell builtins here. \nSpeaking generally for the moment, debugging is a huge topic in any language. Some other topics that can be handy for debugging in any programing language include, shell redirection and, signal processing.\nFinally, I realize the example I used is trivial, but that some shell scripts can be hundreds of lines. In those situations, I like to either insert comments tags and block out code I suspect is faulty, or Alternatively, insert an exit command, and try to isolate the functional code from the broken code, using a divide and conquer technique.\n\nA: Nowadays, there is the Visual Studio Code Bash Debug extension. It has 'Step in/out/over' and can show the value of each variable.\n\n\nA: A GUI option for debugging a bash script is the Eclipse IDE with the BashEclipse/Shelled pluggins.\nThis gives the features of your question (breakpoints and stuff) along with a host of other features for debugging complex bash scripts.\nSome of the features include:\n(https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/155551/how-to-debug-a-bash-script)\n\n\n*\n\n*Break Point toggle\n\n*Single Step-by-step operation\n\n*Step-in, Step-out, Step-over functions and sub-routines\n\n*Examining code variables at any point while script is running\n\n*TODO task list\n\n*Bookmark list\n\n*Multiple Window Editing\n\n*Remote Sharing of the project environment\n\n\nThe Script Editor perspective:\n\nThe Debugging perspective:\n\nThe steps for using is to add the Shelled and BashEclipse pluggins to eclipse.

Is there any defragmenter out there for ext3?\n\nA: http://launchpad.net/e2defrag.\n\nA: Shake\n\nA: There is a useful article but it's a few years old:\nDEFRAGMENTING LINUX EXT3 FILESYSTEMS USING SHAKE AND DEFRAG \n\nThere are a few tools for this, and I'm going to cover Shake and Defrag.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shake is a defragmenter that runs in userspace, without the need of patching the kernel and while the system is used (for now, on GNU/Linux only). \n\n\nIt works by rewriting fragmented files. But it has some heuristics that could make it more efficient than other tools, including defrag and, maybe, xfs_fsr.\n\n\n*Defrag is a shell script. Download the latest version from HERE.\n\n\nUsing Defrag is very easy: copy the script in a folder you want to defragment. This can be just a normal folder or the top level directory of a partition.\n\n\n", "Q: How do I get three monitors working with Nvidia? My workstation has two Geforce 7300GTs and three monitors, and I'd like to put them to good use. Dual monitors works out of the box, but triple doesn't. How can I get the third monitor up and going when the Monitor Prefs dialog only shows two?\n\nA: I think that you should be able to do that with installing official nvidia drivers and running nvidia-config\nsudo nvidia-config\n\n", "Q: How can I check processor flags inside a preseed install? I have a postinstall script that runs after my preseed install that checks /proc/cpuinfo for vmx or svm flags and if the server has them, it installs kvm packages.  The only problem is due to the install running in a chroot /target directory, there is no /proc/cpuinfo to look at. The \"lshw\" command doesn't have the goods either.  Any thoughts on how this can otherwise be accomplished?\n\nA: The problem with not having access to /proc is that you don't have any script access to the sysfs calls required to do the check. What you need to do is to make sure your chroot has access to proc.\nYou can do this by mounting /proc before your chroot using the late pressed command like this:\nd-i preseed/late_command string chroot /target; mount proc /proc -t proc;\n\nAnd also a second option: remounting proc inside the chroot like this:\nmount proc /proc -t proc\n\nin fact if it's an installed system, mount /proc alone would work.\n\nA: Another option would be to use the kvm-ok script (or parts of it), that comes in the cpu-checker package. This uses the msr-tools package to query the CPU's MSR registers directly via a /dev node. So that trades needing /proc for needed /dev. :)\n", "Q: How to correctly install the latest Mono, Moonlight and Monodevelop instead of the version in Ubuntu repository?

But you're probably much more knowledgeable about this than I am, so hopefully the instructions there will give you all the info you need. Also, if you build from source, you shouldn't have any problems with the Ubuntu repo versions (unless you haven't completely uninstalled them already).\nGood luck!\n\nA: You can also use http://www.badgerports.org.

Now I want to develop for it!! :)\nIs it possible under Ubuntu and what is the best tool? Eclipse or IntelliJ or maybe something else? \nUPD: It takes about a year for me (sorry my lazyness ;) But this is my first Android app - https://market.android.com/details?id=com.maxsoft.balls\nCreated by Eclipse + ADT in Ubuntu 11.10!\n\nA: if you have prior development experience with Java you can try Eclipse + ADT plugin - the best\nor\nApp Inventor for Android - its very simple and easy, no need of Java programming knowledge\n\nA: It is all up to your personal preference. The Android SDK works fine on Ubuntu (I use it every day) and independent of the IDE you choose to use.\nPersonally I use IntellJ IDEA. The community edition has Android support and is free. Eclipse is the default tool and is also free and works well too. \nI also know many people using other editors like vim, komodoedit and others. I would however suggest to use one of the first two suggestions.\nIn terms of building the app you should look into using the default build using Apache Ant or you could also build it e.g. with Apache Maven and the Maven Android Plugin. In any case find a build tool that is independent of the IDE you use and potentially even use a continuous integration server.\n\nA: As the other two mention, Eclispe + ADT is the best option. Eclispe + Android has a lot of features like logcat viewer, stack trace viewer, DDMS, from where you can also take phone screenshots. You can also simulate texts and incoming phonecalls to test your apps. Debugging is also a breeze. I myself have made an an app for android as part of my college syllabus, and I recommend eclipse + adt. Goto this page for installation help. You can download the SDK from here.\n\nA: Probably the easiest to use, and officially supported, is Eclipse.\nThe Eclipse Android Developer Tools (ADT) plugin allows for basic project creation and management, as well as step debugging and ability to easily export your app for deployment/publication.\nhttp://developer.android.com/tools/index.html\nGoogle now distributes an ADT Bundle, which includes Eclipse with the ADT plugin, SDK and platform tools, and latest Android platform and system image for the emulator.\nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\nThe Android SDK Tools alone can still be downloaded if you prefer not to have the entire bundle, or if you already have Eclipse installed and just want to add the ADT plugin and SDK/platform tools, or if you prefer to use another IDE.\nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html\n", "Q: Fan making noise while running ubuntu Hi i have a newly installed version of ubuntu 10.10 on my laptop. When i run windows, the fan is working properly and is not making sound. but when i run ubuntu, its making sound and is runnning more faster. what could be the problem. Is there any way of rectifying it.\n\nA: If the fan is working at full speed, then something is wrong with the power saving features of the computer. This problem is hardware-specific, therefore you would need to provide details of the hardware components.\nIndeed, one issue would be the graphics card, especially if it is either AMD/ATI or NVidia.\nThe other issue would be the BIOS of the computer. More often than not, the BIOS does not have correct power saving information that is usable in Linux (while it is usable in Windows). You can google for 'DSDT ubuntu' for more on this.\nTherefore, write down the full model number of your computer, and mention which graphics card you have.\nUpdated: You mention the model number in another reply. I performed the google search and I got several relevant results, such as http://kizwan.blogspot.com/2010/07/acer-aspire-3680-resources-for-mac-os-x.html\nThe easiest thing to do is update the BIOS to the latest version and try again.

If it is low, try to slow down the fan manually (following the third link of the bottom) or change manually the frequency of the CPU (second link of the bottom). That may give you a hint.\nIf it doesn't work, try to install \"xserver-xorg-video-intel\" video driver as it may be a video related problem, as was suggested by DKuntz2.\n\nMaybe these links can help you:\nhttp://embraceubuntu.com/2005/11/04/enabling-cpu-frequency-scaling/\nhttp://maketecheasier.com/how-to-control-your-cpu-frequency-in-ubuntu/2009/04/10\nhttp://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_control_fan_speed\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1333321\nKnowing your laptop model could help to provide more specific solutions.\n\nA: Based off my own experience my fans run in over drive when I don't have proper drivers installed (usually graphics). I would check to see if you have any restricted drivers you could install, and if you do, install them. If you don't, I would check up on your manufacturer's website, find out what kind of graphics card you have and see if you need a driver for it.\nI've never had a problem with my CPU causing the fans to go over drive.\n", "Q: Best format for Cinelerra video editor what is the best input format for Cinelerra?

There is a workaround, but is only available for Windows. Could you tell me how to do the same thing in Ubuntu 10.04?\n\nA: If I understand it correctly this command will make the same thing on linux that this registry tweak in windows:\nsudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=100\n\nWhere 100 is the timeout in seconds to forcibly close a socket. Note that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Default value in Ubuntu is 60 seconds, not 30.\n\n*This will be enforced by the kernel. So it can have some effect in other apps.

With my graphics card, I could do 1920, and when I actually do that, the image is very \"unclean\" on the screen...\nI run Ubuntu 10.10, on an HP Pavilion with a GeForce 315. My monitor is a HD ready Samsung LE32C450... my smaller previous monitor had no problem showing a 1920 resolution, and my obvious mishap was to assume a much bigger screen would support at least this same resolution...\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: You've already said you can change the resolution to one higher than your monitor supports (I'm guessing it's a feature of the display). Another way to do it would be the newrez script by Marc Brumlik.\nBut I'm afraid that won't change anything. There just aren't enough pixels to display text cleanly.\nYou can always decrease the size of the text if your display feels a bit cramped. To do that, go to System → Preferences → Appearance → Fonts → Details... and set your display resulution to a lower value:\n\nThanks to the good design of the Ubuntu font, even 50 dpi is very readable, provided your display operates at its native resolution.\nFor the best results with most fonts, the resolution should be divisible by 12.\n", "Q: Network Manager troubleshooting I'm having some issues when connecting to my house's wifi from my Ubuntu 10.10 laptop.\nIf the connection doesn't exists, when selecting the network (and after entering the WPA2 password) I'm able to connect. Once the connection is saved, when trying to reconnect, Network Manager works for a minute or so and then fails; the only way to reconnect then is to delete the saved connection and re-select the network from the list of available wireless networks.\nThe same network works with no issues on the same laptop when running Win7, and on other wireless networks when running Ubuntu.\nIs there a Network Manager log which I can take a look at for troubleshooting the issue? Are there any tools for checking the wifi status?\n\nA: You can look at System --> Administrator --> Log File Viewer, Under \"dmseg\" file to see if something with the authentication process is wrong\n \nSome more experienced people will suggest to harvest the power of terminal by doing something like :\ncat /var/log/* | grep network-manager > network-manager-output.txt\n\nI hope you can find a solution to your problem\n\nA: I have the same problem, very annoying. I tried disabling the 11n with options iwlagn 11n_disable=1 11n_disable50=1, but didn't help much.\nMy latest attempt (an hour ago) is removing network-manager and installing wicd.

I have got a new laptop and I will be using it from now on. But I will have to do the setup all over again (setting up applications/updates). Plus many of my preferences and tweaks I've had in my desktop will be lost and those too I will have to all over again. \nIs there an easy way where I can just take image or something and use it in my laptop??\nAny help/pointers/links are much appreciated.\n\nA: *\n\n*on the old PC:\n  dpkg --get-selections  > backup.pkg.lst \n\n\n*on the new PC - install Ubuntu with default packages\n\n*copy backup.pkg.lst from the old PC to the new one\n  sudo su\n  dpkg --set-selections < backup.pkg.lst \n  apt-get update\n  apt-get dselect-upgrade\n  apt-get dist-upgrade\n  apt-get upgrade\n\n\n*copy home directory from old PC to the new one\n\nA: Most of your display and application preferences are in your home directory (/home/<yourlogin>).\nCoping this directory between your desktop and laptop computer should give you 80% of what you want. Just tar your home on the desktop, copy the archive and untar it. (scp would loose symlink and other things)\nFor the remaining 20%, I would consider a fresh install because laptops need special tuning. From an energy saving point of view, your battery will last longer when the system is tuned for that computer.\n\nA: You could always try the Desktop Recovery in Ubuntu Tweak. It allows you to save your desktop settings, installed applications, and your system settings as separate files. The back-up files could then be copied to the laptop and recovered. \n\nA: In the - [whispering quietly] - Windows world, I have used Acronis True Image to make disk images and recover them to other disk partitions.  As you suggest, disk imaging would be an easy way to port everything - operating system, applications, settings, etc. - exactly as configured on one partition to another disk.  I have used Partimage (http://www.partimage.org) under Linux; however, it appears that the current version of Partimage does not support Ext4, so if you need this feature, you will need to use another imaging package.  One possibility is Clonezilla (http://clonezilla.org/).  I have never used this software, but the home page indicates that it supports most file systems.\n\nA: Remastersys (www.remastersys.com/ubuntu.html) would be an appropriate solution to your requirement. It will produce an iso from your existing system (you can choose also to put your data into the iso), which you can use to burn a cd (DVD as the ISO will be bigger than the standard 700MB of Ubuntu) or create an usb stick. Than you can install ubuntu on your laptop with all settings and applications (and data). It is like a fresh install, so also the power saving issues as mentioned in answer 1 would be covered.\n", "Q: How to set up Dropbox on Ubuntu Server?

Other help pages are related to those with a GUI.\nRunning dropbox status returns: Dropbox isn't responding!\nHow do I login to my existing Dropbox account and choose a folder for it to start using?\n\nA: Dropbox has instructions for a text-based Linux install here.\nThe short version is that the first time you run the dropboxd daemon, it will warn that it's not linked to an account and give you a URL to visit in order to link it. By default, it will use ~/Dropbox as the Dropbox folder, but there's a Python script you can download to change it.\n", "Q: I bought an album yesterday with 22 tracks on it, but only 10 show up for download All 22 show up in the download queue within Rhythmbox. The queuing feature never really works there anyway though, so I usually go to the web site, click on Files/Purchased Music/band/track to get what I purchased.\nThis has worked well for other albums, but 'Greatest Hit ... (and 21 other pretty cool songs) has been showing 10 tracks for the past 17 hours. Any clues?\n\nA: I had the same issues with Rythmbox, It has to do something with the \"tags\" of the tracks. To make my mp3's shown under the corresponding Album and not scattered around, I had to fix those files with a program called EasyTags.\nUltimately, I had to switch to Banshee Media Player...\n\nA: It's possible that the files are on your desktop and are either not getting picked up or getting picked up in a weird way by Rhythmbox; check your ~/.ubuntuone/Purchased from Ubuntu One/ folder.\nIf the songs are not in that folder, please check the same folder via the web interface.\nIf the songs are not online either, please contact support.\n", "Q: Network Manager, create multiple lan connection configuration for the same wired card How can I create in Network Manager, multiple wired lan connection configuration for the same wired card?\nI use to move between a lot of offices where I need to change my network config (IP, Mask, ecc) is it possible to create or save different configurations for the same network card and activate the right one time by time?\n\nA: On Ubuntu 11.10 with Gnome 3, you will only get the stripped down version of the gnome control panel's network manager (like when you are running gnome-control-center network from terminal).\nIf you want to configure a second (or more) wired network connections, run nm-connection-editor. It lets you add new connections.\n\nA: Right click on the NetworkManager icon.  In the \"wired\" tab, open up your existing connection (\"Auto eth0\") and copy the Device MAC address so you can put it in the new configuration profile. Then select \"Add\" to create a new connection profile for your wired connection.\nAfter this, I believe all the profiles you've created should show up as options in your network list when you plug in a cable.\n", "Q: How to redistribute binary programs built on modern Ubuntu so that they can be executed on any older Linux system? I found that if I build any binary on Ubuntu 10.10, then it doesn't execute on some older Linuxes. It is because Ubuntu uses a very new C library, called EGLIBC. Most of the desktop Linux systems use GLIBC. \nI would like to know whether there is any standard method how to redistribute binary programs built on a modern Ubuntu so that they can be executed on any older Linux system ? \nHow to find all required dependencies (glibc  version, dynamic libraries) ?\n\nA: If you insist on doing that, then you can not use any shared libraries; you must link with -static.\nTo find out what it links to from the source, look at the linker command for -lfoo switches.  To inspect a binary, run ldd on it.\n", "Q: How to apply a patch to indicator applet? I have a patch named \"incator.patch\".

I need to write a manual to the software I made. If it possible to use gettext when writing a manual, or other documents?\n\nA: Check out Sphinx to write your documents in reStructuredText and make them translatable in gettext format.\n\nA: afaik gettext is useful when you have a programming language which contains strings, that is when strings are intermixed with code.\n\nalert(_(\"Hello\"));\n\nThen a preprocessor finds all occurrences of _(\"..\") and generates a .po template and then you copy that edit that .po file translating \"Hello\" to your language:\n\nmsgid \"Hello\"\nmsgstr \"Cześć\"\n\ngettext is aimed to solve the problems you encounter when you use string inside a programming language, typically format strings with positional arguments, plurals, duals (some languages have duals), etc, stuff which might change the translation due to runtime parameters.\nThis kind of things is not necessary on manuals, because manuals normally don't have runtime parameters which change the sentences.\nThe only advantage I see of using gettext would be  to preserve markup, but usually markup (in latex, docbook etc) is an operation that defines your structure so it's part of the semantics of your documentation, while the appareance should be handled in a different place (css, etc). \nI don't feel that the ability to isolate the translation from the markup will be a big advantage, considering the noise that xgettext tags will introduce in your documentation markup language.\n(Furthermore I don't know of any tools that would preprocess and postprocess latex/docbook/whatever with gettext)\n", "Q: Problems with subversion (in gnome keyring, maybe), user=null I'm having a problem with my subversion in Ubuntu, and it's happening only on my computer, my colleagues are working fine.

TP-LINK TL-WN722N is a usb antenna for wireless network.\nThe antenna cames with a cd for windows (and works just fine), but how can I install it on Ubuntu? It's not recognizing alone.\n\nA: Ok good news and bad news the good news is in most cases you dont actually need to install drivers for things in Ubuntu because the Linux kernel has a lot of drivers built in, the only cases where you may need to install drivers are for graphics cards and network cards(not so much). \nSo the bad news is if you have the card installed fine and Ubuntu itself doesnt offer the driver to you and its not recognizing it, then we dont have the driver. Your best hope is to try a later release of Ubuntu and hope someone added the driver for your card. Its a real pain but it doesnt happen to a lot of people in recent times. \nSo in short you'll more than likely have to wait and see or ask the company who make the card if they can make the driver.\n\nA: You are going to need the compat-wireless drivers and relevant patches. Google \"ar9170 driver\" for all the necessary links(don't remember off the top). I have this working great in Ubuntu 10.10 with the aircrack-ng suite and WiFite. Make sure you dl compat- wireless and unpack 1st. Then dl patches(including \"negative-minus-one-maxim\") to the same directory. The rest is easy as per the links.\nHope this helps.

I know they do this on VMware installs and corporate installs of Windows that can then be customized, but I have not seen this done with Ubuntu yet.\nThanks\n\nA: You can use Remastersys to create a bootable ISO of your current install and then install Ubuntu from that ISO on all other machines. All your installed apps will be available by default.\nhttp://www.geekconnection.org/remastersys/ubuntu.html\n\nImportant:\nUse DIST mode to create the ISO image. Do not use back-up or it will copy your home directory and users too.\n\nA: I did this a couple years ago, for 70K+ laptops, on 8.04 I think it was. I set up Clonezilla SE server to create the ability to unicast or multicast images. Then, after the Ubuntu installation was perfected, I used oem-config and immediately created the image before logging into the machine again. \n", "Q: Where can I see a list of supported bluetooth drivers? Where can I see a list of supported bluetooth drivers?\n\nA: Bluetooth is a bit special, all devices basically speak the same language. There are a few versions of the Bluetooth protocol, which is all that's needed for your Bluetooth device to work, so long as it's connected through an open protocol connector such as USB or PCI(e).\nBlueZ, the Linux bluetooth stack, supports all of the core protocols and is regarded as a qualified implementation by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.\nThere are a few drivers in the kernel, mostly related do devices' special firmware, which you can browse here. This is indeed the full list of drivers, and it's very small. \nAs long as your device implements the Bluetooth specification properly, which most do, Linux will support it. If in your case something does't work correctly, consider asking a specific question or filing a bug.\n", "Q: Anti-aliasing changed after update (or something...)

It's asking me to choose from 3 options.\n\nA: *\n\n*check with \ncat /proc/partitions\n\nto see which partition is the new one (the size can give you a clue)\n\n\n*\n\n*Create some dir to mount the disk \n\n*Add a line in /etc/fstab accordingly\nRun \n sudo mount -a\n\n\nA: Have you tried using the alternative installer iso? It is a hassle to use, but gives you much more control over the installation process. \nThis is just a hunch, I am not sure it will solve the problem. It requires an additional CD-sized download and about half an hour of answering prompts about things the graphical installer discovers automatically, so only try it if the easier methods have failed. \n\nA: I ran into a somewhat-similar installation issue when I was attempting to install Kubuntu 10.4 on a computer with Windows 7 installed.  With the issue, I only had one hard drive, but it just wasn't showing in the partition list, even after I partitioned a good chunk off for the install.\nThe eventual solution revolved around the fact that the live cd had dmraid installed by default.\nI live-booted into terminal, entered sudo apt-get remove dmraid and my issue was fixed.  Hope it works for you as well.\n\nA: I had this issue when I had a partition type of GPD (had Windows 10 on the drive prior), to get around this I used fdisk to create a new 'dos' label.\nIn this day and age I'm amazed that the install doesn't account for this (and support GPD)\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get xRandR to see two separate outputs with the nvidia driver? I have two monitors, which I have set up with nvidia-settings in Twinview. The result: When I want to do something in xRandR, it does not function. It doesn't report one output per video card head, but a single output mapped to the combined area of both monitors: \n\nrumtscho@bradbury:~$ xrandr\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nScreen 0: minimum 3840 x 1440, current 3840 x 1440, maximum 3840 x 1440\ndefault connected 3840x1440+0+0 0mm x 0mm\n   3840x1440      50.0*\n\nNow I promised somebody to help test a driver. The developer is using an open source driver for Intel video cards, and his driver assumes that there is more than one xRandR output, each mapped to a monitor. So I tried rewriting my xorg.conf to somehow get two outputs to show up, but failed. Googling showed that people faced with the xRandR-nvidia problem either stopped using xRandR and achieved what they needed with nvidia-settings, or changed their driver to nouveau. \nThe first is not going to help in my situation, and I am not willing to give up the proprietary driver, because Compiz won't work without it. So does anybody know a way to get nvidia to actually pass on information on outputs to xRandR?\n\nA: The proprietary driver isn't compatible with xrandr and it likely never will be. Nvidia have refused to create a compatible driver and instead have decided to copy their windows based settings and controls.\nOver time, the nvidia driver is likely to fall further and further behind, making it harder and harder to use in a modern FreeDesktop like Ubuntu. You must instead use the nvidia-settings and the twinview, which distorts the desktop across two screens.\n", "Q: Building Awesome WM I am following these steps in order to build Awesome window manager on 10.04\nI am building 3.4 while the tutorial is for 3.1\nI installed all of the specified dependencies including cairo.\nAfter running cd awesome-3.4 && make I get the following missing dependencies error:\nRunning cmake…\n-- cat -> /bin/cat\n-- ln -> /bin/ln\n-- grep -> /bin/grep\n-- git -> /usr/bin/git\n-- hostname -> /bin/hostname\n-- gperf -> /usr/bin/gperf\n-- asciidoc -> /usr/bin/asciidoc\n-- xmlto -> /usr/bin/xmlto\n-- gzip -> /bin/gzip\n-- lua -> /usr/bin/lua\n-- luadoc -> /usr/bin/luadoc\n-- convert -> /usr/bin/convert\n-- checking for modules 'glib-2.0;cairo;x11;pango>=1.19.3;pangocairo>=1.19.3;xcb-randr;xcb-xtest;xcb-xinerama;xcb-shape;xcb-event>=0.3.6;xcb-aux>=0.3.0;xcb-atom>=0.3.0;xcb-keysyms>=0.3.4;xcb-icccm>=0.3.6;xcb-image>=0.3.0;xcb-property>=0.3.0;cairo-xcb;libstartup-notification-1.0>=0.10;xproto>=7.0.15;imlib2;libxdg-basedir>=1.0.0'\n\n--   package 'xcb-xtest' not found  \n--   package 'xcb-property>=0.3.0' not found  \n--   package 'libstartup-notification-1.0>=0.10' not found  \n--   package 'libxdg-basedir>=1.0.0' not found\n\n>CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:259 (message):\n  A required package was not found\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\n  /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:311 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)\n\nawesomeConfig.cmake:133 (pkg_check_modules)\n  CMakeLists.txt:15 (include)\n>CMake Error at awesomeConfig.cmake:157 (message):\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\n  CMakeLists.txt:15 (include)\n\n\n>-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!\nmake: *** [cmake] Error 1\n\nI ran\nsudo apt-get install libxcb-xtest0 libxcb-property1 libxdg-basedir1 libstartup-notification0\n\nbut the problem is still there.

I can use suspend without any problem if I do it manually. It resumes OK as well.\nHowever, for some reason it has stopped doing this automatically. Right now it is set to suspend after 30 minutes but it can be idle for hours without suspending.\n\nA: I would check for any USB devices such as mouses, keyboards, or WLAN adapters... or even a NIC card might be causing it not to sleep... what you could do is set your suspend to 5 mins or something, and eliminate each one, till it works... if it works then you know that device is the cause... if it doesn't work then maybe someone else might have an idea...

Is there a way to do this?\nupdate\nThe machine is a Dell Latitude D400.  If people want more details, just ask.\nAlso, I'm gathering that I need to explain my desired setup a little better.  I've gotten a bunch of suggestions about taking the battery out.  I'm not sure if people are suggesting to take the battery out while the machine is running — this, as I understand, is not a good idea with most laptops — or to just remove the battery altogether.\nThe latter option is not optimal, because ideally I'd like to use the 30-60 minutes of power in the laptop battery and then switch over to UPS power.  The details of the switch-over may constitute a separate question, but if I can't find a way to keep the laptop battery from charging, then removing the battery from the machine altogether may be the best way to do this.  I'm not sure yet if this machine will run without a battery, but I'll check that out.\nOther than the laptop, the UPS is just supporting a cable modem and router and a USB hub.\nAgain in the idealized version of this setup, all the power management changes would be automated, i.e. not require replugging anything or pressing Fn-keys.  I'd like the machine to start using laptop battery power when apcupsd indicates that the UPS A/C is out, and then start using UPS power, but not charging the battery, when the battery is almost depleted.\n\nA: At least some Dell laptops have a key that you can hit to disable battery charging.  I think it was Fn-F2 or so.  The key has a little blue battery icon on it.\n\nA: Given that manual intervention on your part would be required, I'd suggest a low tech workable solution. Plug the laptop into a switchable power strip and plug the power strip into the UPS. Switching off the power strip will stop your laptop from charging and the laptop battery takes over powering the laptop without missing a beat. The UPS will now have more available power for your network components.\n", "Q: Ubuntu freezes when gdm starts I have Ubuntu 10.10 (upgraded from 10.04)\nI was browsing in Firefox yesterday, then the PC suddenly did a reset\nOnce it restarted, everything went normal until gdm begun showing.

This makes me think that there are probably still tons of aliases that I haven't thought to use which could make the lives of me and fellow ubuntu users easier. \nWhat aliases do you guys use which are:\ngeneral - they apply to lots of users\nhelpful - you use them often or they save a lot of time when you do use them\n\nA: These are my preferred aliases:\nalias ll='ls -lAbhc'\nalias l='ls -lBohc'\n\n#History search (use: hs sometext)\nalias hs='history | grep $1'\n\n#Sudo vim\nalias svim='sudo vim'\n\n#Add extra protection against mistakes\nalias rm='rm -I'\n\n#Unrar alias\nalias unrar='rar e'\n\n\nA: The alias I use most often:\nalias go=gnome-open\n\n\nA: a couple of my favorites (and most heavily used!) are:\nalias tgz='tar -zxvf'\n\nand\nalias tbz='tar -jxvf'\n\n\nA: Here is my set from this github project: https://github.com/roubles/bash_aliases\n###############################################################################\n##\n## Essentials\nalias rm=\"rm -i\" # Confrim remove\n\n###############################################################################\n##\n## ls variations\nalias la=\"ls -AF\"                   # List all files\nalias ld=\"ls -d */\"                 # List only directories\nalias l.=\"ls -A | egrep '^\\.'\"      # List only dotfiles (hidden files)\nalias l1='ls -1AF'                  # List files (one line at a time)\nalias ll=\"ls -lhAF\"                 # List all file details\nalias lg=\"ls -AF | grep\"            # Grep through filenames (also see, hg)\nalias lp=\"ls -d `pwd`/*\"            # List full paths\nalias lpg=\"ls -d `pwd`/* | grep\"    # Grep through filenames but list full path\nalias lt=\"ls -Alt\"                  # Sort by time\nalias ltr=\"ls -Altr\"                # Sort by time (reverse)\nalias lss=\"ls -AFlS\"                # Sort by size\nalias lsr=\"ls -AFlSr\"               # Sort by size (reverse)\n\n###############################################################################\n##\n#typos\nalias vi=\"vim\"\nalias vmi=\"vim\"\nalias sl=\"ls\"\nalias pdw=\"pwd\"\n\n###############################################################################\n##\n#tar\nalias tarc=\"tar czvf\"\nalias tarx=\"tar xzvf\"\nalias tart=\"tar tzvf\"\n\n###############################################################################\n##\n#history\nalias hg='history | grep'\n\n###############################################################################\n##\n#chmod\nalias ax=\"chmod a+x\"\n\n###############################################################################\n##\n# Jump down\nalias 1d=\"cd ..\"\nalias 2d=\"cd ..;cd ..\"\nalias 3d=\"cd ..;cd ..;cd ..\"\nalias 4d=\"cd ..;cd ..;cd ..;cd ..\"\nalias 5d=\"cd ..;cd ..;cd ..;cd ..;cd ..\"\n\n###############################################################################\n##\n# Jump down (reverse)\nalias 1up='cd /$(echo $PWD | cut -f 2 -d /)'\nalias 2up='cd /$(echo $PWD | cut -f 2,3 -d /)'\nalias 3up='cd /$(echo $PWD | cut -f 2,3,4 -d /)'\nalias 4up='cd /$(echo $PWD | cut -f 2,3,4,5 -d /)'\nalias 5up='cd /$(echo $PWD | cut -f 2,3,4,5,6 -d /)'\n\n\nA: Here are some that I like:\n#Opens current directory in a file explorer\nalias explore='nautilus .'\n\n#Opens current directory in a file explorer with super user privileges\nalias suexplore='sudo nautilus .'\n\n#Opens current directory in Ubuntu's Disk Usage Analyzer GUI with super user privileges in the background\nalias analyze='gksudo baobab . &'\n\n#Opens a GUI text editor in the background.

This is similar to how in Fish shell you can use 'function' and 'funcsave' - you don't need to open any file in a text editor.\nAlthough I use Fish shell for partly this reason, you can make something similar in Bash:\n$ echo -e \"function alia { \\n echo -e \\\"\\n function \\$1 { \\n \\$2 \\n }\\\" >> ~/.bashrc \\n }\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n# restart shell to use\n# usage: $ alia \"name\" \"cmd\"\n#  e.g.: $ alia \"gac\" \"git add -A; git commit -m \\\"\\$1\\\" \"\n#        $ bash\n#        $ gac \"my commit message\"\n#         \n#         $1 refers to a variable\n#         note that $ and \" characters are escaped in the alias content\n\n\nA: This is one I use for backing up my PPAs. \n#List all of my ppas in a text file dumpable form that can be fed into a script \n#     for re-loading them.

Instead of having to run the sql code many times, I have asked python to loop the sql code over the number of instances which exist in the sql code. You only need to run this code once.

I'm trying to create a bootable USB image to install Ubuntu on a new computer.\nI have done this before following the \"create USB drive\" instructions for Ubuntu desktop, but I don't have an Ubuntu desktop available.\nHow can I do the same using only the command line?\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create bootable USB on Mac OS X following the ubuntu.com \"create USB drive\" instructions for Mac: Doesn't boot.\n\n*usb-creator: According to apt-cache search usb-creator and Wikipedia usb-creator only exists as a graphical tool.\n\n*\"Create manually\" instructions at help.ubuntu.com: None of the files and directories described (e.g. casper, filesystem.manifest, menu.lst) exist in the ISO image, and I don't know what has replaced them.\n\n*unetbootin scripting: Requires X server (graphics support) to run, even when fully scripted. (The command sudo unetbootin lang=en method=diskimage isofile=~/ubuntu-10.10-server-amd64.iso installtype=USB targetdrive=/dev/sdg1 autoinstall=yes gives an error message unetbootin: cannot connect to X server.)\n\n\nUpdate\nAlso tried GRUB fiddling: Merging information from \n\n\n*\n\n*pendrivelinux.com\n\n*a related question on the Linux Stackexchange \n\n*and a grub configuration example\nI was able to get halfway there - it booted from USB, displayed the grub menu and started the installation, but the installation did not complete.\nFor reference, this is the closest I got:\nsudo su\n  # mount USB pen\nmount /dev/sd[X]1 /media/usb\n  # install GRUB\ngrub-install --force --no-floppy --root-directory=/media/usb /dev/sd[X]\n  # copy ISO image to USB\ncp ~/ubuntu-10.10-server-amd64.iso /media/usb\n  # mount ISO image, copy existing grub.cfg\nmount ~/ubuntu-10.10-server-amd64.iso /media/iso/ -o loop\ncp /media/iso/boot/grub/grub.cfg /media/usb/boot/grub/\n\nI then edited /media/usb/boot/grub.cfg to add an .iso loopback, example grub entry:\nmenuentry \"Install Ubuntu Server\" {\n  set gfxpayload=keep\n  loopback loop /ubuntu-10.10-server-amd64.iso  \n  linux (loop)/install/vmlinuz  file=(loop)/preseed/ubuntu-server.seed iso-scan/filename=/ubuntu-10.10-server-amd64.iso quiet --\n  initrd (loop)/install/initrd.gz\n}\n\nWhen booting from USB, this would give me the Grub boot menu and start the installer, but the installer gave up after a couple of screens complaining that it couldn't find the CD-ROM drive. (Naturally, as the box I'm installing on doesn't have an optical drive.)\nI resolved this particular issue by giving up and doing the \"create USB drive\" routine using the Ubuntu Live desktop CD (on a computer that does have an optical drive), then the USB install works.\nBut I expect that there is some way to do this from the command line of an Ubuntu system without X server and without an optical drive, so the question still stands.\nDoes anyone know how?\n\nA: \nWhen booting from USB, this would give me the Grub boot menu and start the installer, but the installer gave up after a couple of screens complaining that it couldn't find the CD-ROM drive.\n\nThis is a known bug with ubuntu server iso (desktop iso works just fine), but there is a fix to get the packages from the iso on the usb drive:\nonce on the installer, Ctrl+Alt+f2 to open a tty and in the terminal:\nmount -t vfat /dev/sdX1 /mnt\nln -sf /mnt/ubuntu-server.iso /dev/sr0\n\nThen switch  back to installer and retry to scan cd for packages. It should work.\n\nA: Let us assume you have nothing but a prompt before you. If you have a GUI, you can open a terminal and do everything described here. Or you may use a tty.\n\nWARNING:\nTo avoid potential damage, follow the instructions very very carefully. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to a root prompt by typing sudo su\nDetect what device the usb is.\n\n*tail -f /var/log/syslog \nYou are now having a live view at syslog.

For instance floating panels and main window in Gimp are independent windows. If I change focus to a full window (e.g. Firefox by doing Alt-Shift) and go back to the main Gimp window I don't get back the floating panels also (I have to change to them as well in order to see them). It would be great if the 3 windows can be \"tied\" (or linked) together in order that they don't get lost behind other open windows when I change back to (make active window) any of them? I think this configuration (if it exists) should show itself more obviously in the gnome environment.\nThis question  seems to address the same problem but it doesn't seem to be accurately answered.\n\nA: This is actually window-manager dependent (read more here), but the GIMP devs did try to workaround the problem by offering a \"transient dock\" method in the 2.5 series.  When 2.6 was released, the option was removed for some reason, but this thread indicates that you can still activate the functionality if you need it.\nThe easiest workaround though seems to be \"use compiz\" (in other words, turn on Visual Effects in system-->preferences-->appearance.  I've tested it just now and with compiz, the docks magically restore themselves in line with the main window.  They also don't appear in the alt-tab list as an option you can use - only the main window.

This will be the guide to use.\nNeeded tools\nThe only tools you need to work with locales are\n\n*\n\n*A text editor. Any will do, though VIM will excell.\n\n*A text-to-unicode converter. It would be most expected that you didn't have one, so I will provide you with a simple one. Read the next subsection to obtain it.\n\nI recommend you to create a directory and save everything related with the work you will do on the locale to it.\nText-to-unicode converter (encodestr)\nNOTE: if you are using non-common characters you may have problems with the script I write below; you might want to take a look at the alternative scripts linked by nass.\nSave the following code to a file. This file will be identified by your system as a python script, which is alright because it is one. This guide assumes you called the script encodestr.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        exit(f'Usage: {sys.argv[0]} <string to encode>')\n    print(encode(sys.argv[1]))\n\ndef encode(s):\n    return ''.join(f\"<U{ord(c):04X}>\" for c in s)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    sys.exit(main())\n\nAfter you have saved it, give the file execution permission - this will come in handy. You can do that using nautilus, or by running from a terminal the following command, on the directory in which you saved the script: chmod +x encodestr.\nYou can now test this script by running on the same directory: ./encodestr hello. You should get an output equal to <U0068><U0065><U006C><U006C><U006F>.\nModify an existing locale\nModifying an existing locale is the easiest case, as ideally you will pick a locale that fits your needs almost totally, in which case you need to make only small modifications. To tailor it, you can use the guide to know which of the sections are the ones you want to change, and how you can change them. All the installed locales reside in /usr/share/i18n/locales, however the guide contains pretty much every locale ever created.\nHowever, the first thing you will notice when you open a locale is that you will read english words as much as weird <UXXXX> codes. You will need to be able to create these codes - this is where the encodestr script comes.\nWhen you know which sections you have to change, you need to know each field contained in the section.\n\nFor example, the LC_TIME section contains the field t_fmt, and many others. Each field has its own description on the guide.\n\nNow that you know which fields to modify, use the guide again to find out what values does the field accept.\n\nFor example, the field t_fmt accepts text and the common strfmt variables.\n\nJust when you know what to write on the fields you want to modify, run the text through the encodestr script to get its encoded equivalent.\nNOTE: Not every field needs to be encoded, use an existing locale as a reference if needed.\n\nFor example, if you want to have the time format Time: %T in the t_fmt field, run ./encodestr \"Time: %T\"; this will return <U0054><U0069><U006D><U0065><U003A><U0020><U0025><U0054> and so you will have the line t_fmt <U0054><U0069><U006D><U0065><U003A><U0020><U0025><U0054> in your locale (in it's respective section, of course).\n\nAfter you have modified every field you wanted to, you will need to proceed to install the locale to the system, so it can be used. Proceed to the installation section for this.\nCreating a locale from scratch\nAs opposed to modifying one, the other method you can use to create your custom locale is working on it from scratch. This is not very difficult if - again - you use the guide. Here's a useful tip though: you can copy sections from other locales without actual copy and paste methods. You just have to follow this format:\nLC_SECTION\ncopy \"locale\"\nEND LC_SECTION\n\nWhere LC_SECTION is the section you want to modify, and locale is the locale you want to copy that section from.\n\nFor example, if you want to copy the time format in the English locale, you would have this text your custom locale file:\n\nLC_TIME\ncopy \"en_GB\"\nEND LC_TIME\n\n\nAnd that saves you a lot of work and assures that any change made to the referenced locale will be mirrored to yours.\n\nInstalling your custom locale\nThe steps I am going to show below may not be optimal, but work.\n\n*\n\n*Compile your locale. Don't panic! This takes no time. Just run the command sudo localedef -i custom -f UTF-8 custom.UTF-8 -c -v where custom is the name of your locale.\n\n\n*Copy your locale to the /usr/share/i18n/locales/ directory. You will definitely need sudo priviledges to do this, and you can do it with the command sudo cp locale /usr/share/i18n/locales/ where locale is the filename of your custom locale.\n\n\n*Specify your locale in /var/lib/locales/supported.d/. For example, create a file name /var/lib/locales/supported.d/asd and add the line custom UTF-8, where custom is the name of your locale.\n\n\n*Run the magic command. I actually don't know what exactly this command does, but it is crucial. Run sudo locale-gen. It is most probable it generates references to the available locales where needed.\n\n\n*Tell your system to use the locale. If you want the locale to be used on a system-wide manner, modify the /etc/environment file. If not, you can modify your ~/.profile file, or any other one that is sourced at startup. If you don't know what the latter means don't worry, just use the ~/.profile file. To know what you have to write in it, first run the locale command. It should issue a list with items like LANGUAGE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_CTYPE and many others. You will write, for each of the sections you want (listed by the previous command), on separate lines, this SECTION=\"locale\" where SECTION is the section and locale the name of your custom locale.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the time format from the Netherlands, but the english language, write:\n\nLANGUAGE=\"en_GB:en\"\nLC_TIME=\"nl_NL\"\n\nNOTE: If you want to use one locale for every locale setting, write LC_ALL=\"locale\" where locale is the name of your custom locale. If you want to use a locale for everything but for the language, you can write LANG=\"locale\" and (on another line, of course) LANGUAGE=\"locale\":XX where XX is the 2 letter code for the language you want.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the Dutch locale and the English language, you could use:\n\nLANG=\"nl_NL\"\nLANGUAGE=\"nl_NL:en\"\n\nYou have finished\nThe next time you log in, your locale should be in use. You can test this by running the locale command again.\nPlease comment about inconsistencies or false statements in this guide!\n\nA: Not sure what kind of customization you want, but you can set some locale variables using your ~/.locale. For example, to get english messages but german time and the likes I use\nexport LC_ALL=\"\"\nexport LANG=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nexport LC_CTYPE=\"de_DE.utf8\"\nexport LC_NUMERIC=\"de_DE.utf8\"\nexport LC_TIME=\"de_DE.utf8\"\nexport LC_COLLATE=\"de_DE.utf8\"\nexport LC_MONETARY=\"de_DE.utf8\"\nexport LC_MESSAGES=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nexport LC_PAPER=\"de_DE.utf8\"\nexport LC_NAME=\"en_GB.utf8\"\nexport LC_ADDRESS=\"de_DE.utf8\"\nexport LC_TELEPHONE=\"de_DE.utf8\"\nexport LC_MEASUREMENT=\"de_DE.utf8\"\nexport LC_IDENTIFICATION=\"de_DE.utf8\"\n\nGenerating custom locales is also possible. See e.g. this guide for dates.\n", "Q: What is \"Free Space Notifier\"?

Depending on nature of the text, sometimes line wrapping is convenient, sometimes it is just confusing.

Are there symlinks involved?\n\nA: When you select your directory in the preferences, it automatically reverts to \"multiple locations\". This is because there is at lease one other location set automatically by the Ubuntu One Music Store:\n~/.local/share/ubuntuone/Purchased from Ubuntu One/\n\nNow, don't delete this directory :-)\nYou can check what directories are set as library locations by opening the gconf-editor (hit Alt+F2 and type gconf-editor), then navigate to apps → rhythmbox and check the \"library locations\" key.\nThis is what it should look like after you've set your library location to ~/Music:\n\nI recommend you just leave it there, and just use the gconf-editor to make sure there aren't any other locations set. But you can also delete the u1 music store entry (though I wouldn't be surprised if the ubuntu one plugin just added it again).\nIn case you do decide to delete either the directory, the gconf entry for it, or both, be safe in the knowledge that you can't break anything by doing that, none the less, you may as well just leave them be; in case you decide to use the Ubuntu One Music Store one day.

So I have upgraded Ubuntu with the latest Kernel. But after the upgrade and after I rebooted Ubuntu, all I get is GRUB. How do I load Ubuntu again when all I have is GRUB?\nI installed Ubuntu using wubi.\nThanks heaps for the help\n\nA: Using Grub\nIf you get to a grub prompt and the system and kernel are still installed on the partition, you can \"manually\" boot the system - i.e. without the help of a working grub.cfg. This also works with a grub run from live media. To this end grub includes a rudimentary command ine, which you can use to find the partition and boot the system.\nfind /vmlinuz\n\nThis should give you the partition like (hd0,0). You can also use the ls command to poke around the partition and see which kernels are available. The search command works similarly. You can also use tab completion.\nset root=(hd0,1)\n\nOf course, replace the parition identifier with whatever find showed you.\nlinux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1\ninitrd /initrd.img\n\nSelect the kernel image and initrd image, a pair which always needs to be used together. Luckily Ubuntu creates a pair of symlinks in the root directory which point to a working image and initrd. Note that you need to replace /dev/sda1 with a representation of the partition in the scheme used by the Linux kernel. Roughly, (hd0,1) corresponds to /dev/sda1; (hd0,2) corresponds to/dev/sda2;(hd1,1) corresponds to /dev/sdb1.\nboot\n\nThis boots the selected kernel from the selected partition. Once you've managed to boot your system, you can use that to restore grub, as is detailed e.g. here.\nGrub with Wubi\nThe above was premised on the assumption that Ubuntu was installed regularly, i.e. in its own separate partition. As you write, you used Wubi, which means you installed it to a large file on a Windows (NTFS) partition using a technique called \"Lupin\". I see no reason why this couldn't work in principle, though the process is more complicated. Here's the content of a grub.cfg based on a Wubi install:\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ntfs\nset root='(hd0,msdos5)'\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set be300f9c300f5ab3\nloopback loop0 /ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nset root=(loop0)\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 loop=/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img\n\nYou'll need to adapt this to your particular case. In this snippet, taken from a 10.10 install, the search command finds the root partition using a filesystem UUID or identifier, which you presumably don't know; you can use --file --set /ubuntu/disks/root.disk instead (here's the official documentation). This grub configuration creates a virtual disk - a \"loopback device\" - called loop0 which represents the contents of the \"partition file\", /ubuntu/disks/root.disk on your NTFS partition. With a bit of trial and error, you should be able to make this work.\n", "Q: How to make sudo remember my password and how to add an application to startup I guess this should be a simple thing for ubuntu users out there. I have two questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Whenever I need to run some command that requires permission from root, I run as sudo followed by that command. It would be nice if that does not prompt for password (but I should still be issuing a sudo to make sure that I know what I am doing). How to do this?\n\n*Every time I start my system, I go to terminal and start my VPN using sudo vpnc. This is almost everytime! How to automate this to a startup script?\nHelp much appreciated! Thanks\n\nA: First Question\n\n\n*\n\n*If you dont want to enter password everytime,then you should edit sudoers file.\nsudo visudo \n\n*Then add the following line at the end of the file.\n%username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL \n\n\n*Now if you enter sudo followed by the command  it wont prompt you to enter password. \n\nSecond Question\n\n\n*\n\n*For your second question you can add that command sudo vpnc to startup applications.\n\n*To add that command in startup applications Goto System → Preferences → Startup Applications.\n\n\nA: Tag the users or groups who you want to have passwordless access to sudo with \"NOPASSWD\" in your sudoers file (sudo visudo to edit it). See the man page for sudoers for more details.\nYou can then create a startup script by editing the appropriate file for the shell you're using -- .profile, or .bashrc, or .cshrc, and so on.\n\nA: In 10.04 I see that in the Network Manager (v0.8) I have a flag on the VPN Configuration screen (System > Preference > Network Connections , click the VPN tab, select the connection and \"Edit\") \"Connect Automatically\" I believe that it fires up the selected connection at login.\n", "Q: Is it safe to configure \"Shutdown\" on \"When laptop lid is closed\"? To setup a laptop owned by a complete PC novice any settings that may become hard to tackle remotely need to be avoided. The laptop will be administrated via SSH. One thing in my list are problems arising from improper wake-ups from suspend or hibernate as they may also affect network accessibility.\nThis is why I thought setting up power management to \"shutdown\" on closing the laptop lid could be a good idea. However I am not sure if this is a safe way to do. What problems in addition to software not closing properly (and thus not saving their data) could I be faced if I proceeded as planned?\n\nA: As you mention, you may have problems with software not closing properly. Apart from that, the shutdown occurs as a proper shutdown sequence, exactly as if you had invoked it from the menus, so you're not going to have additional problems.\nThis is how I set up my own lapotop and my girlfriend's netbook, which cannot resume from sleep/hibernation properly. In two years, I haven't had any single problem related to shutdown via closing the lid.\n\nA: A couple of things that might become annoying, due to a sudden halt or shutdown, would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps like firefox, deluge, cleaners etc might not save session data, making it a difficult process to resume and restore them afterwards.\n\n*Some apps might fail in logging session details\n\n*Driver settings might automatically get restored (I had this issue with laptop brightness)\n\n*If it isn't a forced halt then some GUI apps might veto the shutdown and prevent the computer from turning off. (apps like text-editors)\n\n", "Q: Is there a schematic overview of Ubuntu's architecture? as enthusiastic, advanced Linux learner, I'd love to get an overview about Linux' architecure/structure in general. You know, like \"the big picture\".\nI'm thinking of a large schematic graphic showing what is what, who is who, what system (e.g. X) comprises which subsystems (GDM/Gnome/Compiz) on the way from a to z, from boot to interactive desktop, including the most important background services (auth, network, cron, ...). \nMaybe a bit like this: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pgc/140859386/ but way more detailed. There's bootchart, which produces very comprehensive charts, but they again are too detailed and difficult to get the \"big picture\" from.\nIs there such a thing? Possibly not for the whole System, but maybe for single subsystems?\nI had trouble searching for this, because using search terms like \"scheme\" or \"architecture\" pointed to the wrong direction (a tool called \"scheme\" or CAD software for linux).\nI appreciate any links. If there's interest in those schematic overviews and links, maybe someone could turn this post into a wiki post?\n\nA: There are lots and lots of them. The more you want to know, the more diagrams you'll have to dig up.\nThis is one I made. But I gave up when I noticed that it's only ever going to get more complex, and I'll have to stop somewhere.\n\n(note: this image probably contains a bunch of mistakes)\nUse it as a guide to look in details at each of the subsystems (and notice that many are missing).\nThis, for example, is a diagram of the Linux Kernel structure:\n\n(this image by Conan at en.wikipedia, licensed under cc-by)\nHere's another one on xorg: \n\n(source)\nThis is Moblins idea of the stack, it particularly highlights the relationships between the toolkits and APIs:\n\nBetween them, these diagrams cover a great portion of what's going on in Linux operating systems.

One way is by not connecting it to the AC adapter all the time which will overcharge it. I read that in this website. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there an application which automatically prevents the charging of the battery once it has reached 80% charged? I mean that is such a cool feature. Sometimes people tend to forget to remove the AC adapter and this could diminish the capacity and reduce the life time of the battery. \n\n*Does the battery indicator in ubuntu display info or pop-up when the battery is almost dead (dead not in the sense of usage time) but rather a degraded battery?\n\nA: I don't agree with the answer. Keep battery always 100% charged is NOT suggested.\nFor Li-Ion rechargeable battery (almost all laptop use li-Ion battery) , most manufacturers suggest to keep them in a cool and dry condition with 40%~50% capacity, no matter for camera battery or laptop battery. Why? Because this is the best conditon for battery storage. I have several evidences to support my opinion:\n1) My Thinkpad X31 laptop with battery always full charged and dead in around 3 years later. Only 10% capacity left.\n2) My Thinkpad T400 laptop has a battery with good condition after 3 years usage (more than 85% capacity left), by limitting the threshold to 30%~80%. I never overcharge or deep discharge the battery, it will reduce the lifespan of battery significantly.\n3) I have several 18650 size Lion Sanyo batteries, which is the material of laptop battery, when they were shipped to me, the voltage are all around 3.78V (around 40% of it's capacity), while the full charged voltage is 4.20V. It means in factory, they are charged only to 40% capacity, for storage reason. \nI saved them for around 2.5 years in refrigerator (so it's always cool), and the voltage of them still keeps around 3.76V~3.77V. \n\nA: *\n\n*You can get some additional information, apart from right clicking the battery icon next to the clock (get's shown when you pull out your power chord), by opening a Terminal and typing\ncat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/*\n\n\n*\nDoes the battery indicator in ubuntu display info or pop-up when the battery is almost dead (dead not in the sense of usage time) but rather a degraded battery?\n\nYes it does:\n\n(something like that)\n\nA: OMG, The top answer is wrong and it is very convincing since its first paragraph.\nHowever, when it comes to \"Batteries LIKE being fully charged\", it is clear that there is some miXunderstanding between Li-ion and other batteries (Ni-based and lead-acid).\nNi-based and lead-acid car batteries \"LIKE being fully charged\" but Li-ion \"DO NOT\".\nIt is already correct that Li-ion LIKEs being in 30%-80% level of charge due to Li-ion cell deterioration beyond the range.\nHowever, the answer were already right about depth of discharge i.e. the less discharge the more life cycle.\nI used to have the same conclusion as the top answer when I first read that top search-result How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries page and remembered only the part about depth of discharge. Years after I got to read it again and was so dazzled how could I missed to remember such critical part so I did search for Li-ion cell deterioration and found a research paper so I was certain it was true about 30-80% myth.\n\nA: Wow, that web site is COMPLETELY WRONG.  I am an engineer and among other things, sometimes design and build battery packs.  I have read many data sheets from battery manufacturers and they all say the exact opposite, and I have experimental evidence that they are correct.\nBatteries LIKE being fully charged.  If the charger is overcharging them, then it is broken.  A correct charger stops charging the battery when it is full, so it is good to leave it plugged in if you can.  The more often you discharge the battery, and the deeper you do so shorten its life.  A typical battery can handle several thousand cycles if you limit depth of discharge to 30% ( meaning you recharge it once it falls to 70% ).  Going to 50% cuts the life of a typical battery down to the 1000 cycle range, and 30% or less drops it to a few hundred.  A battery that is fully discharged and remains that way for weeks or months will loose much of its capacity if it can be recharged at all.\nNotice the inverse relationship between depth of discharge and state of charge.  Battery manufacturers and engineers use the former term.  The marketing guy who wrote that web site probably did not understand the difference and so he got it upside down.\n", "Q: In what cases should I install (and configure) Postfix as a desktop user? Possible cases:\n1) I plan to do Debian packaging (this case is the motivation since postfix gets installed as a dependency of some development packages, so it means that in such a case might be necessary).\n2) I plan to use Evolution and a Internet provider mail account.\n3) I plan to use gmail.\nSurely if I read Postfix documentation I may find the answer, but its huge and couldn't find it. In any case how (or where) should I find the answer to a question like that by myself? (I really tried)\n\nA: Postfix is a Mail Transfer Agent, so broadly it can accept mail to send to other people, and it can deliver mail locally.\nInstalling Postfix on a desktop/laptop/netbook end-user machine is something people normally do when they want to be able to queue up mail on the local machine when it's disconnected, for later transmission to another server.  For instance, if you want cron scripts to be able to send mail off your desktop to your \"real\" address, this would be a good reason to install Postfix.  (And this is the reason it's pulled in by things like mdadm and devscripts.)  You can find descriptions of how for instance to get Postfix to relay your mail through Gmail.  This is case #1 in your list.\nSecondarily Postfix is useful when you want to deliver mail to local mailboxes.  It is fairly rare these days to do this onto your desktop, but certainly still valid.\nIn case #2 Evolution will take care of spooling and transmitting messages itself.\nIn case #3 with Gmail, normally you'll use its web interface.  If you want to use a mail client like say mutt with it, or you want to be able to send mail from the command line to gmail, postfix would be a good addition.\n\nA: I like using Postfix as a smarthost. (The Postfix mail server on the workstation routes outbound mail to my \"real\" SMTP server.) Then I configure multiple POP accounts with fetchmail, which forwards all of the POP'd mail to the local Postfix server for delivery. In this way, everything feels seamless and command-line mail still works (mailx).\n", "Q: How do I take a screenshot of what is currently in vram? I'm an artist specifically focussing on glitches and errors and I'm currently trying to find a way to create images like this that were made by taking screenshots of what is currently in vram. Is it possible to do this in Linux/Ubuntu? If so, how?\n\nA: Dumping the VRAM content should not work from userland. It would need support from the driver in the kernel. If you are lucky, your driver might contain triggers to dump the memory, but they may only be available if you compile certain debugging options.\n\nA: I've noticed an interesting glitch on my machine that produces aesthetically pleasing glitch art results, though it is not as direct or useful as a raw VRAM capture.\nI use gnome-mplayer - though any mplayer-derived software should do - with the vdpau hardware accelerated video output module for (relatively recent) nvidia graphics hardware.  I had to get a vdpau-capable version of mplayer from a PPA with 10.04 but I think it works out-of-the-box in 10.10.\nThe glitch occurs when you enter or leave fullscreen with a video paused.  The window will be full of wonderful garbage, random bits of whatever was recently in video memory recently: video, bits of UI, 3D graphics if you were playing a game.  It gets dumped into the window whatever size it is.\nOnce you start playing the video, it goes away because the window's contents are continually refreshed.  But I've taken several screenshots of when it does something particularly interesting.\nI'm no expert on graphics programming, but it seems like it would be pretty trivial to write an OpenGL program that (mis)uses pointers to get a bunch of junk from video ram and then render it out to screen or an image on disk.\nIf you'd like, I can dig up some examples I captured when I get home.\n", "Q: How can I prevent my connection to automatically disconnect when I lock my screen? How can I prevent my (WiFi) connection to automatically disconnect when I lock my screen? Note that this problem does not occur on my home LAN for some reason.\n\nA: I think that if you enable the connection \"for all users\" (you can set a checkbox for this when you edit the connection properties) it should not drop anymore.\n", "Q: Automatic syncing USB HD drive to local HD (different computers) I have a desktop PC at work, and a laptop at home.... or elsewhere.\nWhat I want to do is use a USB HD to store my documents (about 130 Gb, maybe more). That would serve as backup and also port my files to my laptop. I'd like any of both computers to automatically sync all files there with local copies, so that I can work at either of them and keep updated copies of everything in both (plus the USB drive, which would allow me to work in other computers, too, apart from being another backup). Dropbox ins't a solution for me, due to pricing and 100Gb limit.\nThe workflow would be as follows, to clear things up:\n\n\n*\n\n*I work on PC1. Changes in files are automatically synced to USB whenever a file is modified.         \n\n*I go home and boot PC2. I plug the usb drive and local files are synced (if changed) with the most recent usb copies.                  \n\n*While I work at PC2, again, changes in files spread to my USB drive.            \n\n*Whenever I go to PC1 again, I plug my usb and again everything synces.            \n\n\nSo the questions would be:\na) Am I crazy?\nb) Can it be done?\nc) Will I have any file conflicts (provided I'm the only one that will modify the files)?    \n\nA: A vague answer would be to use rsync to sync to and from your HDD to a selected file structure on your systems. I typically just use rsync to push changes from my server to backup HDDs, but (without trying this on my own) I can't see why you couldn't rsync to and from the drive. This, however probably wouldn't be something you would do automagically. Just have a script you could call when you want to sync up the drive. You could go hog wild and write a script to listen for when you plug in that specific HDD and then kick off the rsync scripts if you really wanted.\nrsync on wikipedia\nBasic rsync tutorial\n\nA: Thanks for the links... I'll take a look at them because, actually, I haven't ever used rsync, as I recently moved from the 'other side' of OS's. There I used Viceversa Pro, which was good but wasn't automatic, and each execution needed to scan all files in source and all files in target to sync.... Took long, of course.\nI was thinking about something as what is described in this page... would something like that do the trick? ...and could I somehow set the script described there to run whenever the filesystem (the part of it I choose: one or more folders) is changed? (i.e. not timed events, but HD events driven)\n", "Q: \"eclipse Could not save master table to file\" I have my eclipse telling about every 10 minutes that \"eclipse Could not save master table to file\".\nI found an old discusion on this, which tells to delete /home/<username>/.eclipse folder, but I did a search and there's no such folder in my whole system.\nAny idea how to solve this?\n\nA: Try setting correct privileges to the file \n<workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources/.safetable/org.eclipse.core.resources`\n\nI would suggest setting correct permissions for the whole workspace\nSee discussion here\n\nA: My .safetable file was missing, so I just created it and problem solved.\n\nA: it's clear from the path reported that .safetable is not a file, but a folder.

If I don't report back then you may assume this was all that was needed.\n", "Q: Problem installing LibreOffice I followed the instructions for installing LibreOffice found here, which are basically the same instructions found all over askubuntu and the web in general. \nI followed the instructions (including removing OO first) for gnome; all that is in my Applications menu now is LibreOffice (OO used to have OpenOffice Spreadsheet, OpenOffice Presentation, etc.) When I open LibreOffice, I get the splash screen/menu, but all of the choices for creating new docs are greyed out. \n\nIt also will not open any office/type files (no errors; they just don't open.) The terminal commands indicated that installation was successful, but obviously something is missing. I'm guessing I can just reinstall OO from the software center, but I'd really like to give LibreOffice a try, given the lack of ongoing development on OO. Can anyone help me out?\n\nA: If you have no extensions installed, try removing your ~/.LibreOffice and ~/.OpenOffice folders as well. If that doesn't work try reinstalling. \nBtw, check in synaptic and ensure that all the libreoffice packages are installed - I have a gut feeling that only the core got installed somehow.\n\nA: Maybe you have installed the suite, but not all the apps included (Writer, Impress etc.). Try the following:\n\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-writer libreoffice-calc libreoffice-draw libreoffice-math libreoffice-impress libreoffice-base\n\n", "Q: How can I make sure one Upstart job starts before other Upstart jobs? This is a general Upstart question, but let me use a specific case:\nCentrify is a NIS to ActiveDirectory gateway.  It needs to load before any service that will depend the authentication service that it provides, e.g. autofs, cron, nis, et al.\nThis has proven to be quite challenging to achieve, even when trying to change the dependencies of the other services (which I don't think we should be doing anyway, I don't want to touch the other Upstart jobs if at all possible).\nSuggestions?\n\nA: The solution is to approach the problem from the other direction: to satisfy the start criteria for Centrify, it is not necessary to make existing services\ndepend on the new Centrify service, rather make the new Centrify service\ndepend on existing services.\nFor example, an Upstart configuration file /etc/init/centrify.conf could say:\n\nstart on (starting cron or starting autofs or starting nis)\n\nConverting this into English, this would translate as:\n\nstart the Centrify service just before either cron, autofs or nis\n    start (whichever starts first).\n\nThe order in which cron, autofs or nis start is irrelevant: Upstart will ensure that Centrify will start before whichever service starts first, thus ensuring\nthat Centrify is running before any one of those services start.\nNote too that Upstart will block the start of the first service that wants to start until Centrify has started running.\nVery elegant and simple once you get used to thinking in this manner.\n\nA: James's answer works for a 1 to 1 dependency. For a 1 to many, i.e., to make sure service A starts before services B, C, and D, you need to take another approach. You can look at the current portmap scripts for reference but here is the general approach:  create a wait script.\nScenario: you want your Service A to always run before service-b, service-c, and service-d.\nSolution:  create a wait script for Service A. Call it \"/etc/init/service-a-wait.conf\"\n# service-a-wait\n\nstart on (starting service-b \n    or starting service-c\n    or starting service-d)\nstop on (started service-a or stopped service-a)\n\n# We know that we have more than one job that needs to wait for service-a and\n# will make use of this service, so we need to instantiate.\ninstance $JOB\n\n# Needed to make starting the job successful despite being killed\nnormal exit 2\ntask\n\nscript\n\n    status service-a | grep -q \"start/running\" && exit 0\n    start service-a || true\n\n    # Waiting forever is ok.. upstart will kill this job when\n    # the service-a we tried to start above either starts or stops\n    while sleep 3600 ; do :; done\n\nend script\n\n\nWhat this means in plain English is:  when service b, c, or d signals that they want to start, they must wait to start until service-a is running.  The service-a-wait job is designed to run until service-a has started.  Once service-a-wait exits, now services b, c, and d are free to carry on and run.\nThis will assure service-a is up and running before any of its reverse dependencies attempts to start.\nNote: the \"instance $JOB\" line is important in this \"start on... or.. or..\" scenario.  Otherwise you will only really block for whichever of B, C, or D fires off first.\n(instantiation deserves a better explanation honestly.  for now, just do it. ;)\n", "Q: How do I find the build dependencies of a package? I'd like to find out which packages\nsudo apt-get build-dep <package>\n\nwould install (if I already got some dependencies installed, I'd also like to see those → so running or simulating the above is not enough). Command line preferred.\n\nA: For a full list of dependencies, including the dependencies' dependencies, you can use:\napt-rdepends --build-depends openoffice.org\n\nThe command may remind you to install apt-rdepends first. \nYou can use the following command to only show the ones that are not installed:\napt-rdepends --build-depends --print-state openoffice.org | grep NotInstalled\n\nSee apt-rdepends --help for all the options.\nNote: This will generate a massive list.apt-rdepends -b xterm, for example, generates 8773 lines of output, and takes it's time doing it.\nIf you only want to see the packages that are required to build the topmost package, i.e. what do I need to install to build nautilus, run:\n\napt-rdepends --build-depends --follow=DEPENDS nautilus\n\n\nThis is roughly equivalent to Carsten Thiel's answer (The following NEW packages will be installed), but the output format is a bit nicer. It also only shows the topmost package, whereas simulated apt-get also shows packages installed as dependencies of those.\nThis also shows packages that are installed. But it may also show packages that are installed by default. Unfortunately, neither method is much help when you're trying to clean up your system after running apt-get build-dep. As far as I know, there isn't a reliable method of finding which ones were installed except from looking at the apt log file at /var/log/apt/history.log.\n\nA: apt-cache showsrc <pkgname> | grep ^Build-Depends\n\nshowsrc displays the debian/control file for a given source package. We then grep for the line(s) which begin with 'Build-Depends' which has the list of packages needed to build from source.  \n\nA: The option -s (--simulate) will output everything that would be done without doing anything.

On another computer it reported temperatures below 0 degrees centigrade, which was not possible, considering the environment temperature of ~22-24.\nIs this some known bug/issue? Should I try some Windows programs (like CPU-Z) and see they give similar results?\n\nA: Depending on your hardware the sensors on your motherboard need additional calibration. Unfortunately the standard values given in /etc/sensors.conf and in /etc/sensors3.conf can only give you rough estimates because of variations in your hardware.\nHowever there is nothing that can't be set up. There are many self-explanatory notes in the sensors.conf file and you will also find additional information in man sensors.conf on how to do this.\nIf your really need precise values there is no way other than taking a thermometer and measure yourself for setting up the calibration. This can take hours as you need to measure at different temperatures. Such precise values are not really needed for a normal hardware setup. If you feel like overclocking then maybe you need at least calibrate the upper limits to avoid hardware damage.\nIf you use the lm-sensors panel applet then you also have access to a GUI to ease calibration.\n\nA: You either have to follow the traces on the motherboard and have a reference datasheet for the chipset, or you have to make an educated guess.  In your case I would say temp3 is almost certainly just not connected to a sensor and so it always reads at max temp.\n", "Q: unable to access usb device I'm reading my boot logs, at /var/log trying to understand why the boot process is taking so long.\nI found that the system can't access many usb devices, but can't understand why.\nIs there a way to stop Ubuntu from trying to access them?\nHere are the lines:\n\n/var/log# grep -r \"usb_id\" .\n./boot.log:usb_id[716]: unable to\naccess\n'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.2/3-1.2:1.0/input/input7/mouse1'\n./boot.log:usb_id[721]: unable to\naccess\n'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.2/3-1.2:1.0/input/input7/event7'\n./boot.log:usb_id[725]: unable to\naccess\n'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.2/3-1.2:1.0/input/input7/event7'\n./syslog:Jan 12 21:12:05 TomsterInc\nusb_id[955]: unable to access\n'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.2/3-1.2:1.0/input/input16/event16'\n./syslog:Jan 12 21:12:05 TomsterInc\nusb_id[956]: unable to access\n'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.2/3-1.2:1.0/input/input16/mouse3'\n./syslog:Jan 12 21:12:05 TomsterInc\nusb_id[963]: unable to access\n'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.2/3-1.2:1.0/input/input16/event16'\n./daemon.log:Jan 12 21:12:05\nTomsterInc usb_id[955]: unable to\naccess\n'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.2/3-1.2:1.0/input/input16/event16'\n./daemon.log:Jan 12 21:12:05\nTomsterInc usb_id[956]: unable to\naccess\n'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.2/3-1.2:1.0/input/input16/mouse3'\n./daemon.log:Jan 12 21:12:05\nTomsterInc usb_id[963]: unable to\naccess\n'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3/3-1/3-1.2/3-1.2:1.0/input/input16/event16'\n\nupdate\nNot sure if it helps, but here's the list of my PCI devices\nPCI Devices\n-----------\n\n-PCI Devices-\nHost bridge     : Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Memory Controller Hub (rev 07)\nPCI bridge      : Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset PCI Express Graphics Port (rev 07)\nUSB Controller      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #4 (rev 03)\nUSB Controller      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #5 (rev 03)\nUSB Controller      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #6 (rev 03)\nUSB Controller      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller #2 (rev 03) (prog-if 20)\nAudio device        : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03)\nPCI bridge      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 1 (rev 03)\nPCI bridge      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 2 (rev 03)\nPCI bridge      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 4 (rev 03)\nPCI bridge      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 6 (rev 03)\nUSB Controller      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #1 (rev 03)\nUSB Controller      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #2 (rev 03)\nUSB Controller      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #3 (rev 03)\nUSB Controller      : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller #1 (rev 03) (prog-if 20)\nPCI bridge      : Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge (rev 93) (prog-if 01)\nISA bridge      : Intel Corporation ICH9M LPC Interface Controller (rev 03)\nSATA controller     : Intel Corporation ICH9M/M-E SATA AHCI Controller (rev 03) (prog-if 01)\nSMBus       : Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) SMBus Controller (rev 03)\nVGA compatible controller       : ATI Technologies Inc Mobility Radeon HD 3400 Series\nAudio device        : ATI Technologies Inc RV620 Audio device [Radeon HD 34xx Series]\nNetwork controller      : Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802.11b/g (rev 01)\nEthernet controller     : Broadcom Corporation NetLink BCM5784M Gigabit Ethernet PCIe (rev 10)\nFireWire (IEEE 1394)        : Ricoh Co Ltd R5C832 IEEE 1394 Controller (rev 05) (prog-if 10)\nSD Host controller      : Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822 SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter (rev 22) (prog-if 01)\nSystem peripheral       : Ricoh Co Ltd R5C843 MMC Host Controller (rev 12)\nSystem peripheral       : Ricoh Co Ltd R5C592 Memory Stick Bus Host Adapter (rev 12)\nSystem peripheral       : Ricoh Co Ltd xD-Picture Card Controller (rev ff) (prog-if ff)\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It looks very much like you have a broken usb sub system.

Click on the Touchpad tab and select two finger scrolling. Click Close and it should now work.\n\n\nA: There's actually no support currently for two-finger scroll on touch screens.  The current support for two-finger scroll is implemented in the synaptics X driver, which is tailored for touch pad use, and probably won't behave properly with a touch screen.\nSo, although you've got two-finger multitouch happening there's not currently any support for turning a two-finger drag gesture into a scroll event.  This needs toolkit (GTK+, Qt, etc) support.  I'd expect the Canonical DX touch team, who are working on the multitouch stack, will implement this support in the next couple of releases.\nSince the multitouch protocol stuff is almost available in an upstream X server there should soon be more people able to work on this, too; not just people working on Ubuntu.\nAt the moment (Ubuntu 11.10), this is a missing feature.\n", "Q: Problem with indicator-applet-session I'm Brazilian.

But I know people here can definitely answer this. I login to one of my deployment boxes using SSH (no ubuntu here). \nI am working in a tool called TeamCity which uses a folder called \".BuildServer\" under home directory of the user. This folder may grow in size as the application runs but the current user is only given a limited amount of space. But the good thing this I got a folder access outside /home/deploy (deploy being the user here) folder. I now want to link this .BuildServer inside the /home/deploy directory to the other folder where I got permission for (meaning all the files should be re-routed to that directory)\nHope my question was clear, please help.\n\nA: You've multiple options if you want to point /home/deploy/.BuildServer to an other directory, /under_root/somefolder/.\n1) Create a symlink\nln -s /under_root/somefolder/ /home/deploy/.BuildServer\n\nYou should remove the .BuildServer directory first. Alternatively, you can move the .BuildServer directory to the new location:\nmv /home/deploy/.BuildServer/ /under_root/somefolder/\n\nNow run the ln command (see above).\nNote: the user accessing /under_root/somefolder/ should have access to that folder. Say the user is deploy, somefolder is owned by deploy, but /under_root is owned by some other user. You've now two possibilities: let deploy be a member of the group, used for /under_root and give add the execute bit to the group. (chmod g+x /under_root). The other case is that deploy cannot have the groupship over /under_root. In that case, make sure that anybody can dive in the directory: chmod o+x /under_root). This has to be done for every folder \"above\" /under_root/somefolder.\n2) Bind mount\nThis can only be done by a user with root permissions (ask your sysadmin).\nmount --bind /under_root/somefolder /home/deploy/.BuildServer\n\nUsing this method, there is no need to mess with the permissions of /under_root. Another advantage over symlinks is that this method works even if ssh chroots to /home/deploy.\n", "Q: How do I get a TeckNet New Webcam Camera to work? I recently bought this webcam.

I understood that the Unity desktop in Natty uses Compiz and therefore requires a graphics card driver that support composition effects. Does this mean if I have an ATI or NVIDIA card I'm forced to install a proprietory driver because the open source drivers for those cards do not support Compiz?\n\nA: I have an ATI card, and Unity/Compiz works fine for me with the open drivers in natty, although I'm sure that depends on the state of the drivers for your particular card.  If your card supports compiz with the open drivers than it should also support unity.  \nThere is a (impressively long) list of ATI cards with open-source 3D acceleration at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver\n\nA: On Maverick I can use Nouveau for my Nvidia graphic card and I have 3D graphics; so I believe that on Natty you could use drivers open source if you want..\n\nA: The requirement for Unity is that the graphics driver should have 3D support.\nNvidia cards would need the proprietary driver since the open source driver doesn't support 3D.\nI have a laptop with Intel chipset 945GM which has open drivers for graphics. It also supports 3D. \nThe answer is - Unity needs 3D support. If your card has FOSS driver which support 3D, then you are fine, otherwise you need to install proprietary drivers\n\nA: Currently I am running Natty with Unity 3D on an Nvidia card using the provided experimental 3D FOSS drivers. No issues aside from my cards fans spinning faster.\nIf the quality of the driver at least stays the same you will not need properitary for Nvidia cards.\nThe nvidia-current driver does not yet support the new Xorg anyways.\n\nA: I believe Unity requires 3D graphics. So if there is an open driver that can do that, you don't require proprietary drivers. \nLooking a the status of the FLOSS nouveau drivers, currently you probably would need the proprietary drivers for NVIDIA, however, they are working on the necessary features.\n\nA: For people who use older hardware or have driver problems the Unity 2D interface will be available in 11.04 (and in a PPA for 10.10)\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install and switch to the Unity 2D desktop?\n\nA: In short: No.\nI hear that there should be a low-power (2D) option with Unity.\n\nA: The answer is No: Compiz will be happy as long as your free/libre/open source driver has -- even experimental -- support for 3D acceleration.\nMy dad has an AMD K7 box w/ GeForce2 MX 400 (nv11).

I'd like to move from windows with my current workstation. The only thing holding me back is that I have 3 monitors connected to the system and I really take advantage of the real estate when working.\nI just installed Ubuntu 10.10 on the system and one of the monitors is up and running just fine. This monitor is connected to the built-in Intel adapter. I also have two old nVidia GeForce4 MX 4000 (nv19pl) cards in my two PCI slots with two  monitors connected to them respectively. I installed the legacy (and proprietary) nVidia drivers (the nvidia-96 package) that claims to support these old cards.\nNow the question is how to get X configured to use all adapters (using two different drivers) so I can use all three monitors (and is this even possible)?\nFrom what I've read, it looks like I'll have to write an xorg.conf file since the nVidia driver doesn't support the auto-magic configuration supported by other drivers. On this site:\nhttp://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config\nit says that on 10.10 I just need to write an xorg.conf \"containing only those sections and options that you need to override Xorg's autoconfigurated settings\".\nSo, does this mean I can get away with only including the nVidia-specific configuration stuff and all else will get auto-configured? Or, will providing a config with a \"Device\" section overrule the auto-magic from detecting/using the Intel adapter?\nI ran the included nvidia-xconfig to generate a basic, nVidia-specific xorg.conf but I'm hesitant to reboot with it in place, suspecting I'll have a screwed up display. Also, is there any way (any tool or command) to generate an xorg.conf from the current, auto-configured running state of an X session? If I have to write a full, complete config, I'd rather start with one that includes everything that's been auto-detected thus far (and merge it with my nVidia version).\nAnyhow, any info and thoughts are greatly appreciated (as are answers).\n\nA: First, nvidia-xconfig will have saved a backup of your original xorg.conf file. You might check that this is so before proceeding, but even if it didn't keep a backup the old file is most likely the default anyway. \nNext, if you restart X and the display is broken, make sure that you can get to another console and / or kill the X server. I recommend you test whether Ctrl+Alt+F2 works to switch to another console. It might also be a good idea to set up an ssh server on the machine if you haven't already, so that you can login even if the console is unresponsive (I've seen X misconfiguration cause X to ignore keyboard events).\nLastly, yes, there is a way to autogenerate a new xorg.conf file: delete the existing file and restart X. \nX will attempt to autodetect all settings and write an xorg.conf if it does not detect one.\nIf it turns out that the xorg.conf generated by nvidia-xconfig does not support the Intel device and the old xorg.conf does not support the nVidia devices, you can try to diff the new file against the old one and patch the differences into the old file.\n", "Q: Installing Windows 7 on a Ubuntu 10.10 System I initially formatted my Windows Vista Machine because it was given me problems and installed ubuntu 10.10 as the primary OS and no secondary installed all I have now is Ubuntu 10.10 running smoothly but now I want to install windows 7 as a secondary OS so that I can dual boot , Any Help?\n\nA: *\n\n*Windows Dual Boot - Installing Windows After Ubuntu\n\n*Recovering Ubuntu After Installing Windows\n\nA: This mainly depends on your existing disk layout. If your entire disk is already used for Ubuntu, you first have to resize it and/or reorganize your file systems/partitions to accomodate Windows.\nAlso, Windows may have issues if not installed on the first partition of a disk, but this is unclear to me.\nBut the bigger issue is that if you install Windows AFTER having installed Linux, you will [temporarily] loose access to Linux. This is because Windows will take over the boot sector for itself. It will not recognize Linux as an operating system, but the partitions (ext3, for example) will be seen as unknown partitions, and be left alone.\nIn order to fix this, you have to do the following:\n- Boot in Linux and get an initial list of all your partitions and mount points. You should be able to get this by using the mount command with no parameter. You don't even have to be root for this. Look for any line that contains \"/dev/sd\" in it. You can also enter:\nmount | grep \\/dev\\/sd\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a FULL BACKUP of your files. You never know what may happen.\n\n*Resize your disk to have Windows installed (make sure you have enough space for all your applications)\n\n*Install Windows itself (Base OS is sufficient)\n\n*Reinstall the Linux boot sector, so that it can offer a choice between Windows and Linux.\n\n\nThe last part is the one that may be short in time, although more complex and technically-oriented one. In order to rescue Ubuntu, you basically need to boot on a LIVE CD (I recommend the latest of Ubuntu, or the one of your installed Ubuntu distro) and from there reinstate the GRUB-based boot record.\nOnce you are booted, enter the commands (go one by one and check for errors):\nsudo su\nmkdir mydisk\nmount /dev/sda1 ./mydisk\nchroot mydisk\n/usr/sbin/grub-install /dev/sda\nReplace /dev/sda with the partition that was mounted as / in the mount command previously entered. This should replace the boot record, reading the existing grub configurations, and also adding the Windows boot record, making it as an option in the new boot menu.\n\nA: Create a new partition (I recommend NTFS for Windows) and at the beginning of the Windows installation process, you can specify on which partition you want to install to OS.\nAfter, you have to reinstall GRUB (or any MBR you are using) to have the choice of which OS you want to use at the machine start-up.\n", "Q: Uploading to my local server is slower than downloading from the Internet I have a home Ubuntu server that I use for storage. I have mounted a sftp share on my laptop to access my server but the upload speed I get is very slow (~400kb/s) compared to speeds I usually get when downloading through Bittorrent (~800kb/s). It's kind of weird... I should get higher speeds on a LAN than on the Internet...\nHow can I speed up uploads to my server and how can I troubleshoot where the bottleneck is?\n\nA: Transfer speeds are hindered by three factors. Bandwidth, Protocol, and Disk speeds.\nBandwidth\nThis really doesn't seem to to be the issue - as you've mentioned you're on a LAN - ideally there isn't much to go wrong on a LAN except for other users taking more bandwidth on the network or poor reception (be it WIFI or long distance cable).\nProtocol\nThis is where more overhead comes into play. You compared speeds of Bittorrent and SFTP - well those protocols differ extremely. Bittorrent is a highly compressed, multi-threaded, multi-seed (multi-peer) file transfer protocol. SFTP is FTP over SSH which can add some overhead especially when paired with and Bandwidth issues.\nDisk\nHard drives are the last thing people suspect with talking about download or upload speeds. However, you can only save (and write) data as fast as your hard drives can spin (unless you're using an SSD (Solid State Disk) in which case this does not pertain to you).\nI noticed you mentioned that you can download from Bittorrent to your laptop and experience poor uplink speeds to your server. Have you tried to run speed tests from Internet to your home server? That should help you benchmark speeds from \"Internet\" to server. Secondly, ensure you don't have any other major traffic on your network when you're running these tests (like having Bittorrent open) as it'll produce invalid results.\n\nA: It's very possible that you're being limited by the capabilities of the network devices you are using. Keep in mind that given two devices, transfers (upstream or downstream) are going to be limited to the slowest system.\nYou can look at the output of the ethtool command, which comes from the ethtool package, to see the current state of association and speed for the system and interface you are using. NetworkManager also displays that information in Connection Information...\nTo speed up transfers, you may also choose to disable compression, disable encryption, or any of such tweaks to ssh/sftp to try to reduce the use of CPU for purposes other than network so that the transfers can go faster.\n\nA: SSH (and SCP, SFTP) can be very CPU intensive. Check how much CPU is being used by either the client or the server. If they're anywhere near 100%, this is likely the main source of the bottleneck.\nYou can try using FTP or rsync to compare the results, which will not use encryption for the file transfer.\n", "Q: Nvidia problem after inappropriate shut down After by battery died on my laptop I started my computer after plugging it to the ac adapter, for no reason that I know I cant use the visual effects any more as if my graphic card is not installed (my graphic card is GeForce 300m and nvidia x-settings is working)\nI tried generating a new xorg.conf file but nothing happened I marked all the installed nvidia driver in synaptic for re installation and didn't really help\nI googled the problem appears to be popular but couldn't find a solid solution\nAny Ideas ? \n\nA: Thanks luri for the help but I figured it out \nWhat I did is this: \nDownloaded the nvidia driver from their website \nreboot -> recovery mode -> root command line level -> uninstall all nvidia drivers -> get down to level 3 \"telinit 3\" -> stop gdm \"service gdm stop\" -> delete xorg.conf file -> install nvidia that I downloaded \nEverything is now perfect \n", "Q: Hangs up on install \"Who are you\" -- Dell Inspiron 1150 \nPossible Duplicate:\nInstaller gets stuck with a grayed out forward button. \n\nI'm installing to a Dell Inspiron 1150 from a CD.

I think these errors indicate that either SMART isn't switched on in your bios or that the hard drives don't really have that capability. My guess is that they're reading in random bytes or zeros.\n\nA: It indicates that either the drive is returning bad SMART information, or GSmartControl is broken and doesn't understand it.

I would get updates for both versions 4 (Minefield) and 3.7 (Namoroka). Now I want to keep version 4 nightly, but replace the 3.7 nightly with 3.6 stable. I've already removed the 3.7 nightly, but can't figure how to install 3.6 stable (systemwide). Trying to install it using apt-get starts downloading the nightly again. Where do I need to make the necessary changes?\nEdit for further clarification:\nInstalling version 3.6 stable is not a problem. Adding the mozilla ppa is not a problem either. Getting version 4 nightlies is, likewise, not a problem. Installing and running both verstions simultaneously does not cause a profile overlap -- they each have their individual profiles. I have no problems with profiles whatsoever.\nWhat is the problem then? This -> After you add the mozilla ppa, you also start getting the 3.7 nightlies. So? The process overwrites the stable version of 3.6 with a nightly of 3.7 -- this is what I do not want.\nTemporary solution that I have -> Before installing updates everyday, I deselect the 3.7 updates, which keeps the 3.6 intact. I just don't want to have to do this. I want to stop getting updates for 3.7 nightly.\nIt isn't a big thing at all. I'll probably just have to uncheck some box somewhere, or make a little change to some config file.\nBut thanks to everyone trying to help. It is much appreciated.\n\nA: Indeed, if you add the PPA, it will update Firefox 4 nightlies (which is what you want), and Firefox 3.6 to some nightlies (which you don't want, or it will loose its branding and become Namoroka).\nWhat you want to do is to pin firefox so it won't update from the PPA (but firefox-4.0 will).\nCreate the file /etc/apt/preferences.d/ubuntu-mozilla-daily-pin-400 and add this:\nPackage: *\nPin: release o=LP-PPA-ubuntu-mozilla-daily\nPin-Priority: 400\n\nNow, the PPA will have lower priority than the official repositories, so firefox will always check from the official repositories, but firefox-4.0, which is only on the PPA, will be updated from it.\n(source for the configuration: Pinning the ubuntu-mozilla-daily PPA)\n\nAnother way, without using the command line, is to open Synaptic Package Manager, find the firefox package, and on the \"Package\" menu, check \"Lock Version\". But then, Firefox 3.6 won't get updates from the official Ubuntu repositories either. :-/\n\nA: First, remove all firefox versions and all firefox related ppas you maybe have added.\nAfter that type\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\nto install the current stable version of firefox.\nTo install the current version 4 nightly build type this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firefox-4.0\n\nFirefox 4 should now appear here: Applications->Internet->Minefield 4.0 Web Browser.\n\nA: Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all versions of firefox and all profiles\n\n*Remove the \"ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa\" repository if you have and run sudo apt-get update\n\n*Install the firefox 3.6 (stable) sudo apt-get install firefox and make a profile for this version\n\n*Install the Firefox-4.0 nightly:\n\n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firefox-4.0\n\n\n\n\n*Run the command firefox-4.0 -ProfileManager -no-remote and create a new profile \"ff-4.0\" and start the firefox\n\n*Make an activator and set the command as: firefox-4.0 -P \"ff-4.0\" -no-remote\n\n*Done! ;)\n\n\nRemember! If you want to run the firefox stable and nightly version at the same time,  always first run the stable version.\nResult:\n\n\nA: To install Firefox 4 without updating the stable default Firefox version, use SilverWave ppa.\nYou can also use my FoxTester extension, which allows to easily install any number of Firefox versions and launch them simultaneously. However, you won't get automatic updates.\nTake a look at my tutorial if you need more info about those methods.\n", "Q: How do I configure the PHP Zend Framework in Netbeans?

Whenever I plugged in my old audio jack headset, sound was immediately diverted from my speakers to the headset speakers, and the microphone was immediately available.\nWhen I plug in my new USB headset, I have to open Sound Preferences and switch both input and output to the headset.\nIs there any way to make this happen automatically?\nI'm using a Fujitsu-Siemens Amilo Pi laptop, Maverick and a Logitech H330 USB headset.\n\nA: This is actually a bug in Pulseaudio.\nHere is a recent bug report on the situation, but it might be a dupe of this older (but reportedly fixed) one.\nHere's a workaround that you could possibly use. Create a text file and paste this in:\n#! /bin/bash\n\namixer cset iface=MIXER,name='Input Source' 1\namixer cset iface=MIXER,name='Output Source' 1\nexit\n\nIf it is fact your third one then you should replace the end numbers on the commands with the number '2'. If fourth, then '3'. And so on.\nYou can then make a launcher on the panel and click on it every time you plug in the headset. It's an ugly workaround for now but until it is fixed (i.e. Pulseaudio remembers preferred devices) I don't see much else you can do.\nYou could do some extreme crazy workaround involving writing udev rules.... but is it worth it? ;)\n\nA: I found the answer here: http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=114968\nYou can do either one of two things (or both):\nopen alsamixer using the command line:\nalsamixer\n\nand then press F6 and select the default device for alsa. Once you've done that,  save the alsa settings:\nsudo alsactl store\n\nIt may also be necessary to edit the alsa configuration file: (/etc/modprobe.d/alsabase.conf).\nYou then place a '0' next to the device you want as your default, so if it's a usb sound device, you'll have a line like this:\noptions snd-usb-audio index=0\n\nThen reboot system.\n", "Q: How can I get gcc to write a file larger than 2.0 GB?

This is more complicated, but then the\n  logs\n      are not generally accessible to the server (which was probably the\n  point of\n      the Apache default).\n3) Change awstats.pl to group adm\n  (but beware that you are then taking\n  the\n      risk of allowing a CGI-script access to admin stuff on the\n  machine!).\n\nI'd go with 1, but what are the recommended permissions to grant?\n\nA: In most setups:\n\n\n*\n\n*awstats runs as your apache user www-data;\n\n*the apache log files are owned by root:adm and have\n-rw-r----- (aka: chmod 640) permissions; and\n\n*the ownership and permissions settings can be found in the file\n/etc/logrotate.d/apache2, the contents of which is:\n/var/log/apache2/*.log {\n    daily\n    missingok\n    rotate 60\n    compress\n    delaycompress\n    notifempty\n    dateext\n    create 640 root adm\n    sharedscripts\n    postrotate\n            /etc/init.d/apache2 reload > /dev/null\n    endscript }\n\nThe simplest solution is to:\n1) Change \"create 640 root adm\" to \"create 644 root adm\" in /etc/logrotate.d/apache2 using your favorite text editor or, if you must script everything:\nsudo sed -i 's/create 640 root adm/create 644 root adm/g' /etc/logrotate.d/apache2\n\n2) Change the permissions on /var/log/apache2/access.log and /var/log/apache2/error.log to 644.\nsudo chmod 644 /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/error.log\n\n3) Restart apache.\nsudo apachectl -k graceful\n\nI've seen people adding the www-data to the adm user group as a solution. That's a lot more permissions for www-data than I'm comfortable with. \nOther more secure options involve creating a new user & groups for awstats and making awstats run/execute as this new user/group.\n\nA: If you go for point 1 and it says that www-data should have at least read permission then the recomended is grant only read.\nYou can alter the line (in logrotate file):\ncreate 640 root adm\n\nto \ncreate 644 root adm\n\nTo give all users (www-data included) read permission.\nYou'll need to change permissions existent files in /var/log/apache2/ to match this setting\nchmod a+r /var/log/apache2/* #or whatever your path is\n\nThen all the files can be read by all users and all the files that logrotate create in the future will have the adecuate permissions\n", "Q: Is it safe to resize root partition?

You can enable that plug-in (if not enabled already), and with that just open up Rhythmbox on another computer and your computer with all the songs will show up on the left pane. Click on that computer (enter in password if you have put one), and stream your music! It's that easy, but you have to have Rhythmbox running on the both computers. Oh and also you need to open up port number 3689 in your firewall (if you have firewall enabled) in the computer that will stream the music as incoming.\n\nA: Can anyon tell me how rhythmbox-client is to be run, and is it even correct of me to think that I can get a rhythmbox window showing the songs on the jukebox?\n\nYou can achieve this if you are forwarding X is enabled ForwardX11 yes is in your config file in your ~/.ssh directory\n\nSo if you are able to launch rhythm box on your computer you should be able to launch it on your computer with Forwarding X back to the pc you are accessing it on. IT should be simple as that. I managed to do the same thing with virtual box on server I run headlessly. \n", "Q: What are the downsides of removing ubuntu-desktop metapackage? I once advised someone to remove a package that depends on ubuntu-desktop meta-package, if she didn't need it (EG: if one uses a different editor than gedit). Someone else said that doing so (removing gedit which will in turn remove ubuntu-desktop) could break things. Is this true? Are there any other potential problems?\n\nA: Removing the meta-package usually will not be a problem until you try to upgrade your system, but I would advise against it. Removing gedit and some of the other standard applications can also be problematic - if other programs depend on them. It is best that you leave them in place unless you know what you are doing. If you want to build your own minimal custom system, try using ubuntu-minimal.\n\nA: During updates new dependencies of ubuntu-desktop will not be installed.\n", "Q: Possibility of recovering files from a dd zero-filled hard disk I have \"zero filled\" (complete wiped) an external hard disk using dd, and from what I have heard: people said you should at least \"zero fill\" 3 times to be sure that the data are really wiped and no one can recover anything.\nSo I decided to scan the disk once again after I've zero filled the disk. I was expecting the disk to still have some random binary left. It turned out that it has only a few sequential bytes in the very beginning. This is probably the file structure type and other headers stuff. Other than that, it's all zeros and nothing else.\nSo if we have to recover any file from a zero filled disk, ...how? From what I've heard, even you zero fill the disk, you should still have some data left. ...or could dd really completely annihilate all data?\n\nA: Yeah... But it depends how paranoid you are.\nA professional could probably still read some of the data. Government/military standards for  \"completely wiping\" entail several passes including writing random data over the entire drive several times, interspersed with 0-fills and 1-fills. This is because there is magnetic ghosting that sophisticated hardware can analyse and pull out. This is expensive kit that most people won't have access to and therefore just hiring somebody to do the extraction is also prohibitively expensive for most people.\nBut there's no reason dd alone can't do these multiple passes. You can tell it where to source the raw data it writes so alternating between /dev/random and zero- and one- passes would, I think, qualify it to do pretty substantial damage to data.\n\nA: \nUpdate\nAccording to the paper linked to by david, recovering overwritten data was possible with floppy disks but near enough impossible with modern hard drives, so the recovery idea is probably best considered a myth.\nI'm leaving my original answer as representing the myth.\nNOTE: The \"myth\" is about recovering data that were physically overwritten. Recovering data that were merely deleted (not overwritten) is a different discussion altogether.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge:\nWhen you overwrite data on the disk, the old data are lost to normal system tools. (If they weren't, a read would return a mix of the bits belonging to the old and new data, so your data would be corrupt and you would need a new disk.)\nBut it may be possible to recover overwritten data using special equipment. The reason is the way a bit is recorded on a magnetic platter: A \"bit\" is a magnetized area on the disk. The area representing a single bit contains a few hundred magnetic \"grains\", and reading a bit will return a 1 if enough of those individual grains have the correct orientation.\nThe trick is that writing is never 100% - overwriting might change the magnetic orientation of perhaps 90% of those grains, which is plenty for reliable reading of the new data. But there is some residual magnetism left in the grains that didn't change orientation. This residue can be read if you have the proper equipment for it, so you could get a (somewhat noisy) representation of the old, overwritten data. Combined with statistical analysis, it is often possible to reconstruct a fair amount of the original material.\nBut this kind of recovery requires specialized hardware, and as Oli mentioned is prohibitively expensive for most individuals. \n\nA: As you can read here, it is impossible to recover data after you \"zero filled\" it.\nThere can be a chance of 56% to recover a single bit correctly, but since you had to recover 8bit to get only one byte, it is very unlikely to recover any data.\n\nA: Be very careful with this information. I work in the HDD industry and I CAN confirm that off-track reads can recover over-written data.\nSome recovery methods use this trick to set the head +/-10% off-track, then read, move it off-track a little more, then read. At some point you will be able to recover what was laid down before the zero fill.\nUse random when possible. Zero is okay for meta-data and MBR erasure. I recommend several random passes to obliterate the original data.\nAlso, zero does not mean cleared recorded bits on an HDD. Zero has a bit pattern just like any other number.\n", "Q: Can linux be windows substitute? can i use linux as a substitute of windows? i mean Can i use MS Office, Photoshop and other softwares which i usually use in windows?\n\nA: You're asking this in a place where almost all of us use Ubuntu instead of Windows as our main operating system. The obvious answer is: yes.\nYou cannot simply install Microsoft Office and Photoshop as their programming is for Windows (or Mac). However you can install a \"virtual\" install of Windows under something called VirtualBox. This is like running a small computer inside of Ubuntu and it'll give you access to everything you need from Windows. Because you're running two operating systems at once you need a slightly beefier computer to get away with this.\nThere is also a compatibility layer called Wine that allows you to install Windows software. This often gives better performance applications with a lower resource overhead but this is traded against software support; not everything will run and what does might be buggy. You can check specific applications on http://appdb.winehq.org\nThen there's alternative software. OpenOffice and GIMP are often touted as the open-source alternatives for MS Office and Photoshop. In my opinion OpenOffice will get the job done for most things. GIMP is also fine but if you're using advanced features in Photoshop, you'll probably miss a lot.\nYou should also consider perhaps moving certain tasks onto the web. For most of my word processing and spreadsheets, I now use Google Docs. It's completely cross platform and has some nice collaborative features. It's not as powerful as OpenOffice or MS Office but I don't need it to be.\nI personally need Photoshop for my work (I'm a web developer when I'm not answering questions here) and I use VirtualBox to run a Windows XP install when I need it.\n\nA: Actually, you can use other open source (and free) sofwares that substitute those, too... for instance:\nMS Office -> OpenOffice or LibreOffice\nPhotoshop -> GIMP\nThose programs, in general lines, do the same things as the ones you were using.\nOn the other hand, if you need a specific program that has no substitute for linux, you can always setup a Virtual Machine, install Windows on it, and install only the programs you need. That's what I do.\n\nA: Excuse me for this question, but... do you own a license for MSOffice, other for Windows and another one for Photoshop? If so (I do hope so!), you should stick to Windows (pretty clear, isn't it). Other else... well... let's view it from another point of view ;)\n\n\n*\n\n*MS Office --> OpenOffice / LibreOffice : not the same, but almost\n\n*Photoshop --> GIMP: not the same, but pretty good indeed!\n\n*Windows --> Ubuntu: no doubt! ;)\n\n\nAny way, if you do own all those licenses, you could also use a VirtualMachine (both VMWare and VirtualBox have FREE versions) in your Ubuntu to install Windows and all that software.\n", "Q: What is the command to know my PulseAudio version?

Is it actually possible to upgrade, or should I rather install a fresh Ubuntu Server 10.04? If an upgrade is possible, do you have any recommendations?\nThanks, Philip\n\nA: You can upgrade your installation, even without the repositories, and it's easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just put in a CD of the next version, 8.04, and the update-manager will ask if you want to upgrade. From 8.04 LTS you could then upgrade to the next LTS, which is 10.04. So it'd be only two upgrades.\n\n*You could also just stick with 8.04, since it's supported until April 2013 (on the Server).\nThe upgrade will probably work perfectly, and in any case it won't break anything. None the less, a fresh installation might give you chance to review your package selection, it will give you a cleaner system (very slightly improved stability) and, most importantly, if you have a good back up, doing the installation is super easy.\nI can't decide for you if you want to do a new installation, but whatever you do, you won't break anything, it doesn't really matter.\n\nA: Recommendation - clean install.  Not a fan of upgrades even with repository support.  Without repo support it's a BEAST I would rather not fight.

Once in a while I need to install a new Ubuntu (I used it both for desktop and servers) and I always forget a couple of libraries I should have installed before compiling, meaning I have to recompile, and it's getting annoying.\nSo now I want to make a complete list of all library packages to install before compiling Python (and preferably how optional they are).\nThis is the list I compiled with below help and by digging in setup.py. It is complete for Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.04 at least:\nbuild-essential (obviously)\nlibz-dev        (also pretty common and essential)\nlibreadline-dev (or the Python prompt is crap)\nlibncursesw5-dev\nlibssl-dev\nlibgdbm-dev\nlibsqlite3-dev\nlibbz2-dev\n\nFor Python 3.2 and later:\nliblzma-dev\n\nMore optional:\ntk-dev\nlibdb-dev\n\nUbuntu has no packages for v1.8.5 of the Berkeley database, nor (for obvious reasons) the Sun audio hardware, so the bsddb185 and sunaudiodev modules will still not be built on Ubuntu, but all other modules are built with the above packages installed.\nUPDATE\nThere are in Ubuntu 14.04 even more patches needed for Python 2.6, and 2.7 etc. I would recommend to instead checkout pyenv. It contains a script python-build (located in plugins/python-build/bin). With it you can install arbitrary Python versions like this:\n$ ./python-build 2.7.8 /opt/python27\n\nWhere 2.7.8 is the version and /opt/python27 is the path it will be installed. Pyenv will download the Python version, apply the necessary patches and configure; make; make install for you.\nEND UPDATE\nPython 2.5 and Python 2.6 also needs to have LDFLAGS set on Ubuntu 11.04 and later, to handle the new multi-arch layout:\nexport LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/lib/$(dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH)\"\n\nFor Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.0 you also need to explicitly enable SSL after running the ./configure script and before running make. In Modules/Setup there are lines like this:\n#SSL=/usr/local/ssl\n#_ssl _ssl.c \\\n#       -DUSE_SSL -I$(SSL)/include -I$(SSL)/include/openssl \\\n#       -L$(SSL)/lib -lssl -lcrypto\n\nUncomment these lines and change the SSL variable to /usr:\nSSL=/usr\n_ssl _ssl.c \\\n       -DUSE_SSL -I$(SSL)/include -I$(SSL)/include/openssl \\\n       -L$(SSL)/lib -lssl -lcrypto\n\nPython 2.6 and 3.0 also needs Modules/_ssl.c modified to be used with OpenSSL 1.0, which is used in Ubuntu 11.10.

It is not part of the prompt.\n\nIf you want to create as root\n: | sudo tee thefile\n\nTo not truncate existing file:\n: | sudo tee -a thefile\n\n\nA: The command\necho -n > file\n\ncreates an empty file, if your version of echo supports the -n switch.\nOr you could use printf\nprintf '' > file\n\n\nA: In general, creating any regular1 file on Linux involves  open(2) ,openat(2), and creat(2) system calls (and specifically with O_CREAT flags). That means if you call any command-line utility that does these system calls, you can create a new empty file.\nMost commonly new filename is created with something like this:\n\n*\n\n*touch /tmp/new_file\n\n*: > /tmp/new_file\n\n*true > /tmp/new_file\n\n*> /tmp/new_file ( bash shell only )\n\ntouch is a standalone utility. Its original purpose is to update the access and modification time of a file, however if the file does not exist - it will be created. Note also that a filename - is treated specially, so if you do want to create a file that is named literally -, you'll have to enclose that into single or double quotes.\nBy contrast, > is a shell redirection operator for stdout stream.  The > operator  specifically calls the openat() system call with  O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC  flags. That means, if the filename does not exist - it will be created, and if it does - the data will be truncated (and therefore gone, so > should be used with care). In most shells nowadays true or : is a built-in , so  doing : > /tmp/new_file is going to be more efficient, although marginally compared to touch /tmp/new_file.\nBut of course it does not stop there. As mentioned, anything that can perform open(), openat() and, create() syscalls will create a file. Hence, we can do:\n\n*\n\n*true|dd of=/tmp/newfile\n\n*truncate --size 0 /tmp/new_filename.txt\n\n*cp /dev/null /tmp/null_file\n\n*true|tee /tmp/some_other_file\n\n*mktemp or tempfile ( for creating temporary files that do not need to exist between reboots !)\n\nOf course, all the above mentioned utilities do not exclusively create files. But they perform the necessary syscall and that allows us to adapt the commands.\n\nOf course, at the level of programming or scripting we may want to create a file as well, especially for efficiency purposes (because calling external commands such as touch from a Perl script or Python will require additional resources).\nPython one-liner:\n$ python -c 'import sys,os;f=sys.argv[1];os.utime(f,None) if os.path.exists(f) else open(f,\"a\").close' myfile.txt\n\nWe can make it shorter with this:\n$ python -c 'import sys,os;f=sys.argv[1];'$'\\n''with open(f,\"a\"): os.utime(f,None)' mysecondfile.txt \n\nAnd in Perl:\n$ perl -e 'open(my $fh,\">\",\"/tmp/perlfile\")'\n\n\n1 Other types of files such as hard/soft links,character or block special devices, directory,named pipes, or sockets require entirely different syscalls.\n\nA: Use the touch command:\nThe touch utility sets the modification and access times of files to the\ncurrent time of day. If the file doesn't exist, it is created with\ndefault permissions.\n\nExample:\ntouch newfile\n\n\nA: cat /dev/null > file1.ext \n\nthe exact way there is also another way\necho \"\" > file2.ext \n\nThe difference is file1.ext will be zero bytes and file2.ext would be one byte. You can check this by\nls -l file*.*\n\n\nA: Using vim editor you can also create an empty file.\nvim filename\n\nThen save\n:wq\n\n", "Q: How to install JDK and Netbeans?

Samba gives me 24 MB/s read and 44 MB/s write, while ftp gives 97 and 112 MB/s under the same circumstances.\nThe documentation says that \n\nGenerally, you should find that Samba performs\n  similarly to ftp at raw transfer speed.\n\nIn my case it clearly doesn't.\nWhere can I find tips on how to debug Samba performance? \nOr alternatively tips for replacing Samba with something else? (I can't use ftp, unfortunately, as I need something that can be used with rsync/rsnapshot.)\nMore details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both computers are running Ubuntu 10.10 (using Samba because I have a Mac as well)\n\n*The Samba share is on a local home network, mounted as \n$ mount\n...\n//server.local/share/ on /mnt/share type cifs (rw,mand)\n\n\n*Samba performance was tested by copying (cp) a single file of ~4GB to and from the share, using time for timing and calculating transfer speed by hand.\n\n*ftp performance are the numbers from the ftp client for get/put of the same file.\n\n*iperf gives network speed ~900 Mbits/s\n\n*bonnie++ gives disk speeds >200 MB/s on both sides for block reads as well as block writes\n\n*Tried changing the parameters suggested in the performance tuning HOWTO (read/write raw, read size, socket options), most of them made little to no difference. (The one that made a difference caused write speed to drop 50%.)\n\n\nA: Actually FTP has quite an efficient data throughput rate once it gets going. The overhead that slows things down is with the getting a file downloading in the first place. That's not to say that there isn't a problem with Samba here. It should be performing nearly identically.\nTo be honest, I don't have much of a clue where you should start trying to fix this.\nIdeally you'd be able to drop another computer in there with a reference install of Samba (eg Windows) and test that as both a client and server against the Ubuntu machines. Then you'd know which machine was the problem, if it was just one direction that was the problem and then you'd be able to report bugs based on this and/or find a workaround for the interim.\nA while back I saw something about certain network hardware glitching under Samba. It was both switches and network adapters but I can't for the life of me find anything about it. It was probably such an edge case that it's not worth considering.\nHow about we sidestep Samba? FTP might not work but what about NFS? It probably has the highest transfer speeds out of the lot (in my experience) and it should handle rsync fine.\nYou could also look at FUSE-mounting the FTP server so rsync can bully it.\n\nA: What kind of performance do you get from running rsync over ssh? Maybe you could do your rsync with ssh and then also use samba for when you need to transfer stuff between your mac?\n\nA: you can try this in smb.conf\nsocket options = SO_KEEPALIVE SO_REUSEADDR \\\n   SO_BROADCAST TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY \\\n   IPTOS_THROUGHPUT SO_SNDBUF=8192 SO_RCVBUF=8192\n\noplocks = yes\n\nwrite raw = yes\nread raw = yes\n\n", "Q: Flash is not working in Chrome (Crossover Linux is installed) I have google Chrome 8.0.552.237 on Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit and flash is not working, I have tried a variety of methods to install flash, including Firefox flash-aid and the flash-installer package and nothing is working for me.

This forum comment and this superuser answer suggest that the audio compression contributes to loss of quality. I've noticed that music played over my BT setup sometimes pitch bends in ways I don't remember the original doing, and I'm wondering if SBC has something to do with it.\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.10 on a Mac Pro, connecting to a pair of Sony DR-BT50's. Is there a way to inspect which Bluetooth codec pulseaudio is using, what codecs both ends of the bluetooth link support?\n\nA: Normally compression doesn't change pitch, but depending on the program the hertz will. For instance if a 48000 file is played at 44100 the file will play more slowly, and will the pitch will drop. Just check the hertz your files are playing at.\n", "Q: Can I get an always-on-top button in windows' titlebar (alongside with minimize/maximize/close buttons)? I use to use always-on-top windows frequently and make them such by setting the option in windows' right click menu. Can I get this option closer, right in windows' titlebar alongside with minimize/maximize/close buttons? \n\nA: You can add such a button to your titlebar, however there is a very strong limitation on it. The issue is that the theme you are using must have an image for it.\nIn gconf-editor (Alt+F2 and enter gconf-editor), go to /apps/metacity/general and add the value above where ever you like it. eg:\nmenu:above,minimize,maximize,close\n\nNow you'll probably not see a whole lot of change, since according to this blog post from the metacity developers only a few themes support it. An example of such a theme would be Crux.\nAdding that button to the theme yourself will, at first glance, require you to delve into your theme's settings; more precisely its metacity-1 folder. It looks like there you would be have to edit the xml file as well as dropping some image files in the folder.\n\nA: You can map a key-binding for this. You can do that by hitting Alt+F2 (to get the run dialog) and running gconf-editor. In gconf-editor, browse to /apps/metacity/window_keybindings and set a key-binding for toggle_above.\nI'd expect this key-binding to be changable from System -> Preferences -> Keyboard shorcuts too, but either I'm blind or it's not there for some reason.\n\nA: To my knowledge this is not possible on metacity, but it is possible if you use compiz (with emerald), kwin, or icewm (AFAIK). If you don't mind running compiz, you could install emerald and emerald theme manager, and edit the theme (or install another) to use this button.\nAnother option would be to use ubuntu-tweak (NB: NOT SUPPORTED) and edit your metacity theme to have the menu button (saves a right click :P).\n", "Q: Meta package / quick reference for command line string manipulation tools?

I want to make my video to be a screensaver.\nIs there any software to make it?\n\nA: There are some really complicated suggestions on here, but making a video your screensaver is really easy when using xscreensaver and mpv. Xscreensaver can be installed by typing sudo apt-get install xscreensaver. Mpv can be installed by typing sudo apt-get install mpv.\nGo into Terminal, and type gedit ~/.xscreensaver. Scroll down to the part of the code that says \"programs\". On the top of the list, put in code similar to this:\n\"Screensaver Name\" mpv --really-quiet --no-audio --no-stop-screensaver --loop=inf --fs --wid=$XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW $HOME/fileDirectory\n\n\"fileDirectory\" can be made a single file, or a folder. If you want to play all the videos in a folder, put something like $HOME/Videos/* You can also limit it to a specific file format by putting that format after the asterisk. (ex:*.mp4) The -shuffle tag can also be applied to make the videos play in a random order.\nOnce this code has been put in, use Ctrl+S to save, and then change your screensaver to your new one.

Follow the next steps:\n1) xscreensaver needs to be launched at startup via \"Startup Applications\" (hit Super and type \"Startup\"). Add a new entry to launch the xscreensaver daemon on startup as xscreensaver -no-splash.\n2)You need to bring up the xscreensaver config app. Hit Super and type screensaver.

If pgrep is anything to go by, its matching is limited to 15 because of stat (see: info pgrep).. \nListings in variants of \"full\" mode (eg -A w w) are not useful when the name concerned has spaces in it, because this name is separated from its args by another space!..  Also, in \"full\" mode, if the process was started by a link, the name of the link is shown, rather than the executable's name.  \nIs there some way to do this (using standard tools)? ...or are spaces a show stopper here?  \n\nA: All utilities get their information from /proc/$PID anyway, but there are (at least) three places in /proc/$PID that contain the name of the executable in some form, and they report different information.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Name field in /proc/$PID/status (also available in a harder-to-parse form in /proc/$PID/stat).

By convention, shells choose the name of the executable as you typed it (with or without a full path). You can get all the arguments from ps with ps -o cmd (or its synonym ps -o command), but the arguments are separated by spaces so you can't reliably tell where the zeroth argument stops. You can read the arguments from /proc/cmdline, where they are separated by null character: </proc/$PID/cmdline awk -vRS='\\0' '{print; exit;}' extracts the zeroth argument.\n\n\nFor completeness, let me mention that these names can change during the lifetime of the process, though most programs don't do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*The process can change Name field of /proc/$PID/status by calling prctl with the PR_SET_NAME argument.\n\n*The executable file can be renamed or deleted.

Is there any netinstall method ? \n\nA: You can proxy and cache the packages (as mentioned in Scaine's answer) but in my opinion, this doesn't save you much time, mostly just bandwidth. Of course the upgrades will download faster from a local source but if you still have to toddle from machine to machine... It's a lot of time. Even SSHing in and triggering the upgrade would take a while.\nThe best tool for the job is probably one of Canonical's paid services: Landscape.\nWith it you can manage all your computers from a nice central web-based UI. Push packages, updates, reboots, with monitoring.\nIt's not free but you can get a 30-day trial to see if it fits the bill.\n\nA: You can try the tool called cssh. With clusterssh you can ssh all the 50 machines at once and relay your commands to all at the same time. When all ask the same question during the upgrade this can help. If one of them requires special care you can do it by selecting its terminal only and get it to the same state as the others.\nThis can work perfectly if you do the upgrade with the console application called: aptitude (you have to first edit the sources.list file). If you never tried this I would try somethings easy first with my 50 machines like installing a program first or running simple commands like ls and cd something like that. When you became comfortable with the tool you can do the upgrade.\nexample use:\ncssh root@host1 root@host2 .... root@host50\n\n\nAs the others suggested setting up a proxy can help, but it is not the main issue.\n\nA: You might want to consider using Squid-Deb-Proxy :\nhttp://popey.com/blog/2010/12/31/caching-ubuntu-package-downloads/\nThe package unattended upgrades will help keep all your systems up to date (but won't reboot them for kernel issues, so not a complete solution here)\nsudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades\nFinally, of all the full commercial patch managers, to my knowledge, the only two that support linux clients are BigFix and Altiris.  As far as know, Ecora doesn't and Shavlick doesn't (despite buying St Bernards some time ago, which did have a rudimentary linux client).\nYou may also want to consider the free project, Puppet, which allows for multiple seat patching and configuration.  Last I looked, the learning curve was a little steep, and some of its functionality is geared towards servers, but it might still be worth a look.\n\nA: See http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade.  It has instructions for both Desktop and Server editions.\n", "Q: How can I enable Visual Effects on Ubuntu 10 running on VMware Player on Windows 7? I am running Ubuntu 10 on a VMware player running on Windows 7.\nI have an Geforce 8800 card.\nCurrently I can't run visual effects, and I wasn't able to find any answer except for changing the VM to VirtualBox.\nSince I already use VMWare for other purposes, I don't want to use VirtualBox.\nIs there a way to enable Visual Effects and stay in VMWare?\nThanks,\nSakin\n\nA: I was looking for the same thing, but VM Player doesn't support visual effects at all, which is pretty much the one big 'damn' I've come across comparing VMP & VB\n", "Q: How to temporarily turn off NetworkManager from the command-line? The network interface should not make a request for an IP over DHCP. So, what is the command to turn off NetworkManager in Ubuntu? \nUpdate:\nI am writing a script in which the interfaces receive static IPs. For this to happen I need to put a line in the script which will turn off NetworkManager. But when I'm not using that script I want to have DHCP on the interfaces.\n\nA: I've recentely had a similar issue. For some reason, NetworkManager would default to DHCP even if I specify a static IP entry in NetworkManager or /etc/network/interfaces. I've solved it by uninstalling NetworkManager. If you want just to turn NetworkManager of temporary, run:\nsudo stop network-manager\n\n\nA: If you don't want to have your inteface make a DHCP request, simply edit it (right on network manager applet, choose \"Edit Connections\", click on the interface in question, then choose the IPv4 tab and change \"Automatic (DHCP)\" to \"Manual\" and specify your settings manually.\nIf you need to turn off network manager regardless, use \nsudo service network-manager stop\n\nYou can specify stop, start or restart for most services.\nHtorque notes that service is being deprecated in Ubuntu in favour of the stop, start and restart commands.  So :\nsudo stop network-manager\n\nwould also work.  I still prefer using service because, as of Maverick, there's no auto-complete when you use the newer commands.  A bug has been filed about this, and from that, a fix has been released, so hopefully this will be rectified in Natty this coming April.\n", "Q: Can I use gparted to resize a Truecrypt-encrypted partition? I have an external drive with two partitions - one encrypted, the other not so.\nI'd like to move all the data to the encrypted partition, and then resize it to take up the whole drive.\nIf I use gparted on a truecrypt-encrypted partition, will that destroy the data?\nOtherwise I have to decrypt, merge, resize and then re-encrypt. \n\nA: Gparted only knows about physical disks - a Truecrypt parition won't even show up in Gparted, unless perhaps the whole partition has been specified as a Truecrypt partition.  Certainly containers don't appear.\nThere is no way to resize an exisiting truecrypt parition (there was a convoluted method that worked prior to version 6.3, but it no longer works in recent versions).\nI think your only option is to move your data to another volume, format your drive and Truecrypt it, then copy your data on to the newly created Truecrypt drive.\n\nA: I am aware that this question is 2 years old now but there is a simple solution and others might ask the same question, so here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy all your data to the encrypted partition\n\n*overwrite the area where the partition will be resized into with random data. In your example you can just overwrite the now obsolete partition (cat /dev/urandom >/dev/oldpartition is slow so there are hints to use something like this:  openssl enc -aes-128-ctr -pass pass:\"$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=128 count=1 2>/dev/null | base64)\" -nosalt < /dev/zero | dd of=/dev/sdd obs=4096 input the correct sector size in the obs and make sure to use the correct device in the of-parameter. This is way faster than using /dev/urandom but no guarantees it is as secure.)\n\n*make a backup of the partition table using dd\n\n*delete the now obsolete partition using parted\n\n*umount the encrypted partition leaving the crypted container open\n\n*note down the starting sector of the partition you want to resize (first switch the units to sectors in parted using \"unit s\")\n\n*delete the partition you want to resize in parted (don't worry your data stays intact, only the partition table is edited)\n\n*create a partition having the exact same start-sector and the intended length\n\n*run cryptsetup resize on the opened crypt-container\n\n*resize your filesystem for ext4 use resize2fs /dev/mapper/crypt-container\n\n\n=> you are done.\nDepending on your filesystem you can even re-mount your filesystem before resizing it\n\nA: Assuming you created the Truecrypt volume by formatting it and not in-place encrypting the data, you can achieve you goal like this (gparted is not an option):\n\n\n*\n\n*mount the encrypted partition\n\n*copy the whole data form the unencrpyted partition to the mounted Truecrypt volume\n\n*unmount the encrypted partition\n\n*use parted to alter the partition table (assuming MBR partition table layout)\n\n*\n\n*delete the second/unencrypted partition\n\n*write down the start sector of the Truecrypt partition\n\n*delete the Truecrypt partition\n\n*create a new partition using the old start sector of the old Truecrypt partition and the last sector of the drive so that the partition spans the whole disk\n\n\n*use extcv in Windows with Truecrypt 7.1a installed to expand the Truecrypt volume within the new partition\n\n\nA more detailed guide is available which will also explain what to do for in-place encrypted partition hosted volumes.\n\nA: Last I heard support for encrypted partitions in GParted was being developed, but no working code had been released.  As such, while you can probably get away with moving the partition, or possibly even allocating it more space (provided you stick the more space onto the end and not the beginning) There is no way for GParted to resize the filesystem inside it, so the additional space won't be usable.  You might be able to add the space on, and then mount the partition and resize the FS from there, but I'm not sure.  I will test it when I get some free time and post back if I can make it work.\nYour best bet is probably to decrypt it, shuffle your data around, and re-encrypt it.\n", "Q: Can turning off drm_kms_helper polling affect screen brightness control? I have a Samsung R430 notebook that has been running Ubuntu for close to a year, now. Since I've upgrated to Maverick, I've been dealing with little, but increasingly annoying issues, that put my faith to question.\nThe first one, a CPU-intensive set of drm_kms_helper, made me compile my own kernel and set polling to off just so I could move my mouse without frequent stuttering. That led me to dealing with a screen that gets dimmer and dimmer after each sleep/wake-up cycle, which eventually leads me to reboot.\nSince I have seen some KMS and brightness related bugs around, I was wondering if it is a definite cause for my problem. If so, has there been any advance on the excessive polling issue for those of us plagued by it?\n\nA: Instead of compiling your own kernel, you can disable polling at boot time. Edit /etc/rc.local and add this line:\necho 0 > /sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/poll\n\nYou'll likely need to open a bug report for the other issue, though.\n", "Q: Is there any API for Ubuntu One? Is there an API set for Ubuntu One? For example, an API to sync contacts, bookmarks, etc.\n\nA: What @Stefano said. Also, right now there isn't a single place where you can go and read up on all the different APIs related to Ubuntu One, but we're building it in time for Natty.\n\nA: Yes.. try see this: https://one.ubuntu.com/developer/\n\nA: The common way to store something persistently and have it synchronise with Ubuntu One is to just use desktopcouch. Here's an example:\nfrom desktopcouch.records.server import CouchDatabase\nfrom desktopcouch.records.record import Record\n\ndatabase = CouchDatabase(\"askubuntu_test\", create=True)\n\nrecord = Record(\n    {\"site\": \"askubuntu.com\", \"awesome\": True}, \"http://example.com\")\n\ndatabase.put_record(record)\n\nWhere \"example.com\" should ideally point to a description of your record format. \nAnd to retrieve the information afterwards:\ndatabase = CouchDatabase(\"askubuntu_test\")\n\nfor i in database.get_records(create_view=True):\n    print i\n\nThe API to desktopcouch is pretty straightforward, have a look at the Desktopcouch Documentation to learn more about it.\n", "Q: Two Ubuntu One shortcuts in Places menu \nAfter updating Ubuntu One, I'm stuck with 2 shortcuts to Ubuntu One in my Places menu.

They're both Ubuntu machines and I would like to turn them into additional base stations.\nI know I could throw more networking hardware at this (network extenders or cable in additional, pure wireless access points) but I've got two Linux machines sitting in ideal places and I feel like they should be able to help me out.\nI've tried ad-hoc networks but I need something that is a lot more transparent (eg you can migrate from base to base without a connection dropping); it should look like one network to clients.\nHere's a diagram of what I want:\n\n\nA: You can use WDS which is supported by hostapd.

Save the dvd as an iso.\n\nA: You do not give any clue what hardware you have. I had that problem (and suspend/hibernate issue) on an old Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop. It had a hot swap drive bay that had a DVD drive in it. But apparently because it could be hot swapped, Linux kept polling for a floppy drive, resulting in log errors attempting to read fd0, lack of auto mounting USB or CD/DVD's, and failed to suspend or hibernate because it could not put udisks-deamon to sleep, which kept polling for the non-existing floppy.\nSo if you have no floppy and are getting any fd0 errors in dmesg or /var/log/messages similar to \"end_request: I/O error, dev fd0, sector 0\", either disable the floppy in your BIOS, or if that does not work:\nAdd following to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (use sudo or gksu to run your editor):\n# In /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nblacklist floppy\n\nThen do: sudo update-initramfs -u\nThen reboot and see if USB and other removable media auto mounts when inserted.\nNote that other partitions on internal drives are not auto mounted unless you make proper mount points (usually in /media unless you want it mounted elsewhere) and entries in /etc/fstab (preferably using UUID). Although, they will mount if you have permission and select them in Places.\n\nA: The first thing I´d try it´s to update your DVD-ROM firmware -for compatibility with more media types- going to the manufacturer support page, next thing i´d try changing the burning software to another one: K3B, Brasero or DVDTools for example.
