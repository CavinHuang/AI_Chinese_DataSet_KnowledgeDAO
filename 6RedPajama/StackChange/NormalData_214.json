["Q: PHP not working on certain File I have recently gotten into PHP. I have PHP and Apache2 installed on my Ubuntu computer. The server is working, and so is PHP. However, I can only get my \"test.php\" file to work properly. I have another file called \"phpinfo.php\" but it does not work. Both files have the same exact code. \n    <?php\n    phpinfo();\n    ?>\n\nWhy would only one file be working? And how can I fix this? \nThank you for your time. \n\nA: Check for the apache config files located in\n\n/etc/apache2/sites-available/\n\nand if you have just installed it, the file would be named as \n\ndefault\n\n. \nEnsure that the config file is pointing to the correct folder and your scripts are located there.\n", "Q: What is the difference between the Atheros QCA6164, QCA6174, and QCA61x4 cards? In Launchpad bug #1436940, the names QCA6164, QCA6174, and QCA61x4 are all used.\nAccording to https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Qualcomm_Atheros, the QCA6164 has the MIMO config 1x1:1, while the QCA6174 has the MIMO config 2x2:2.  What effect does this difference have?\nAlso, which one has the PCI ID 168c:0041?  (It appears that one of them has the PCI ID 168c:003e.)\n\nA: These are different wireless chips.\nThe ids are:\nQCA988X   168c:003c\nQCA6164   168c:0041\nQCA6174   168c:003e\nQCA99X0   168c:0040\nQCA9377   168c:0042\n\nThe difference of 1x1 and 2x2 MIMO is off-topic here. But it can be easily found. Short answer 2x2 should be faster in most cases.\n\nA: 6164 (1x1) has maximum speed of 150Mbps for 11n and 433Mbps for 11ac and 6174 (2x2) has maximum speed of 300Mbps (150x2) for 11n, and 866Mbps (433x2) for 11ac.\n", "Q: Nvcc -v fails but CUDA 7.0 installed and nvcc present I have installed CUDA 7.0 and run deviceQuery from the samples - it passes. If I go to usr/local/CUDA-7.0/bin I can see nvcc is present. \nTo set the paths, I have run these from the terminal:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/cuda-7.0/bin:$PATH\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-7.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\nI have also tried adding these to the bashrc file. However, when I run a Theano test, I get the following error: \nERROR (theano.sandbox.cuda): nvcc compiler not found on $PATH. Check your nvcc installation and try again.\n\nFurthermore, when I run:\nnvcc -v \n\nI get the error: \nThe program 'nvcc' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Thank you. \n\nA: After I added the following to the theanorc file:\n[cuda] \nroot = /usr/local/cuda-7.0\n\nCUDA started working as expected. CUDA samples run correctly and Theano tests also run as expected, using the GPU. \nnvcc -V also works and produces the following:\nNvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver\nCopyright (c) 2005-2015 NVIDIA Corporation\nBuilt on Mon_Feb_16_22:59:02_CST_2015\nCuda compilation tools, release 7.0, V7.0.27\n\nThis stumped me for a while. Note that the V must be uppercase. I was using nvcc -v, which produces an error. \n\nA: Unlike @Chis_Parry, I already had the [cuda] flag setup, I managed to solve the problem by refreshing the shared libs cache using: \nsudo ldconfig /usr/local/cuda-7.0/lib64\n\nI hope this helps someone in a similar situation I was in.  \n", "Q: When I use some themes my menu tabs become white. How can I fix it? \nWhen I use some themes my menu tabs become white. I'm having this problem with many themes, can anybody help?\n\nA: Depending on how you installed this theme, the control file could be in one of the following directories:\n/usr/share/themes/Numix/\n\nor\n~/.themes/Numix\n\nNow, assuming Lubuntu uses the openbox-3 theme settings from numix: the config file should be either here:\n/usr/share/themes/Numix/openbox-3/themerc\n\nor\n~/.themes/Numix/openbox-3/themerc\n\nYou will have to figure out which value to change and what to change it to.\nAlso, it could be one of the color settings in your .gtkrc file or /usr/share/themes/Numix/gtk-3.0/gtk-dark.css or something similar.\nAll color values are in hex values from 000000, which is red 00 green 00 blue 00 (black), all the way up to ffffff, which is red ff green ff blue ff (white). \n0123456789abcdef  \nIt looks like dcdcdc might be the one you need to change but i'm not sure because that one was for alot of text IDK. Use something like gimp to figure out the color values.\n\nalso, on xubuntu, you can set those to show only the icon of the windows instead of the icon and title like you have shown\n", "Q: Install Openstack i would like to know if Ubuntu Openstack can be installed on Digital Ocean Servers? Does it needs to install MASS even if im using Digital Ocean Servers?\n\nA: Not really.  Of course, usually anything can be done, but you will be fighting uphill to do it.  Ubuntu OpenStack is designed to be installed in a datacenter on top of MAAS.\n", "Q: /home is on its own disk. Can I move that disk to a new install? I have a whole disk mounted at /home.  I am upgrading the computer (and the OS drive, so fresh install), and I would like to retain the /home directory (disk) as it is.  How complex is this process?  Is it worth doing it this way, or should I just start fresh and restore all the user files from backup?\nNothing on the drive is encrypted.  Current and target OS are both Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 x64\nOther answers I've found do not address /home being located on a separate disk.\n\nA: Yes, you can.  Just don't forget to NOT format it, and you'll need to mount it as /home/ in the new OS.  Just add a line to /etc/fstab.\n\nA: Note: This is changed after installation of Ubuntu!\nTo make a more specific answer, do this (change it to your desired text editor, I'll be using emacs)\nsudo emacs /etc/fstab\n\nAnd at the end there should be something that looks like this:\n/dev/sda1       /home      ext4    defaults  0   0\n\nNow simply replace /dev/sda1 with your desired partition. To find all of your connected harddrives do\ndf -a\n\nAnd there you can find it's /dev/sd(variable name.) After you do that, save exit, and do\nmount -a\n\nYou're done and your home directory should be moved!\n", "Q: Mobile Broadband disabled Please I need help with kubuntu 14.4. Mobile broadband is disabled and there is no option to enable it because the icon has been greyed out. How do I resolve this?\n\nA: I had the same problem on a regular ubuntu (gnome) the hints on rfkill made me get my connection switched on. If you encounter the \"hardware switched off\" problem, try to reset your bios (I have a Lenovo E130 laptop) which helped in this case.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi adapter not working after installing updates I'm using Kubuntu 14.04 I recently installed updates (including a kernel update) using the Muon Update Manager.

I know chili555 would suggest using 20Mhz instead of 40 if you have that option on the wireless router\nHere is one of his posts copied:\n\nFirst, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not\n  any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your\n  router is capable of N speeds, I have better luck with a channel width\n  of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz. I also\n  have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than\n  automatic channel selection. After making these changes, reboot the\n  router.\n\nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:  \nsudo iw reg get \n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here \nThen set it temporarily:  \nsudo iw reg set IS  \n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:  \ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or vim if you don't have the text editor gedit.\nChange the last line to read:  \nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager\n\nA: I've a Realtek based receiver that has the same problem. Disconnecting and reconnecting makes it working again. It is difficult to troubleshoot and it goes in the direction of 'opinion based' but as far as I can tell it is a matter of interference.\nMany devices like microwave ovens, doorbells, remotes and of course other AP's use the same frequency band which obfuscates or weakens the signal of your AP. Your output file shows lots of other AP's and a relatively weak signal of yours.\nThe indicator you mention only shows there's a connection with an AP, it basically shows there's a carrier signal. The carrier signal is why you can scan for wireless networks. It does not tell you that anything useful is send or received. If your connection is secured it regularly changes the encryption key and depending on your settings it can even change channel. If the encryption key changes during a period of weak signal the receiver can loose track of it. However it does see the carrier and thinks it is still connected.\nThere are a few things you can try to improve the situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move closer to your AP, but that's not really a solution. Nevertheless this really works.\n\n*Change the channel of your AP to one that's less crowded. You can try all the channels you can set.\n\n*If your devices support it try to change to the 5 GHz band which has more channels and is less crowded than the 2.4 GHz band.\n\n*If the problem persists buy a range extender although this actually worsens the situation in the long term because everyone buys range extenders so more or less there's a wireless war going on these days.\n\n", "Q: How to prevent loggin in via ssh as my domestic user? Hi i am kind of a newb in ssh but i setup a domestic server in a laptop. I have a user called e.g. USERBRUNO with a password authentication required. The problem is that if my friend does ssh USERBRUNO@myip he can login and write and read my files without ever having to authenticate with the USERBRUNO password or any at all. I am using RSA authentication method. I added his key. I have the correct (i hope) configs in the sshd_config such as \nPasswordAuthentication YES \nRootLogin NO\nStrictModes YES\n\nI really need to get a hang at this. Thanks.\n\nA: Are you using windows to log in to the server or linux? the process will be different, if you add your friends public key to your profile he will get access to your files, what you may want is to add his public key to his user profile, /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys and change permission to 600 to be readable by the user. give him access to webfiles by adding him to www-data group, and set youself as the owner of files by sudo chown -R yourname:www-data /var/www/public_html/ and \nsudo chmod -R g+w /var/www/public_html/ make sure you change the directory and username appropriately.\nIf you configure to change Password Authentication to 'NO' in /etc/ssh/sshd-config and restart the ssh service by sudo service ssh restart the plain text password authentication will be disabled, be warned that first test that the ssh authentication is working before closing the session  or you may be locked out, for more security you can change the default port to something greater than 1024, and X11 forwarding to no. for more information read this article - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys\n", "Q: No errors but cannot remove a folder from a USD drive I've checked for errors my external USD drive using GParted.

So how great is it as a version control? Is it good enough to replace other version controls out there?\n\nA: Isn't Docker an application container infrastructure?

After the install the computer automatically reboots into Windows. I've tried running repair-boot (http://paste.ubuntu.com/12364293), it told me that i need to disable to secure boot, so I did and ran it again (http://paste.ubuntu.com/12364354). No changes, computer still boots automatically into Windows. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: With EFI there is no traditional boot manager loaded from the MBR that is responsible for booting every OS on the disk. Instead each OS places its bootloader in the EFI partition, which can then be selected from the EFI boot menu.\nIn your case the EFI partition is /dev/sda2 and according to boot-repaircontains the Windows bootloader as well as Grub.\nHow to enter the boot menu depends on the manufacturer of the firmware. I would guess there is a prompt at boot time, hinting at which key to press.\nAs far as I can see from grub.cfg, there is an entry to boot Windows 8 from Grub, by chainloading the Windows bootmanager from the EFI partition. This way you might be able to set Ubuntu as the default OS to boot in the EFI settings and still get the opportunity to boot Windows.\n", "Q: playing Urban Terror on Ubuntu 14.04, while in Urban Terror the mouse is jerky & slow I'm using lenovo thinkpad x250 with Ubuntu 14.04, trying to play Urban Terror but my mouse is acting funny while in play. on regular desktop session my mouse is acting as normal as I can see.

I want to go back to the previous one but cant because this theme is broken and doesn’t open \"appearance\" in setting.\nIf there is some one who could help.\n\nA: If you are using Gnome: Restarting gnome from a TTY can occasionally break things, so the shell is no longer 'attached' to some backends for themes, power management etc (probably). If some action is possible in the Gnome Shell, Alt+F2+r+Enter is usually the easiest way of restarting Gnome.\nIf you are (supposed to be) using another Desktop Environment (DE), like Unity: You have replaced the DE with another DE...\nEither of these should only be temporary, and can be fixed by logging out and logging in again (if possible), or rebooting. If you can't log out etc from the shell, save any work, switch back to the TTY and run this to restart your machine:\nsudo reboot\n\nHOWEVER it can also be possible to log out via terminal, you may want to try this first.

You may see only some of them, depending on your kernel's configuration.\"\nSo is there any way to get fully options?\nThanks!\n\nA: Those files represent configuration of your host network stack, without --net=host you create a new network stack inside a container and files are 'overwritten' by container ones. \nIf you need access to host stack you might consider mounting it somewhere else, lets say /net using -v /proc/sys/net/:/net and then simply use echo value > /net/my/file instead of using sysctl.\n", "Q: Customize taskbar icon Here is my Ubuntu installation:\n\nI'd like to replace that sticky-note icon in the taskbar with that tomboy.svg you can see in the explorer window.\nHowever, upon opening /usr/share/applications/indicator-stickynote.desktop, I cannot find an entry that pertains to the taskbar icon:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Indicator Stickynotes\nName[en_GB]=Indicator Stickynotes\nName[eu]=Ohar itsaskorren jakinarazlea\nName[uk]=Нотатки\nGenericName=Sticky Notes\nGenericName[ca]=Notes adhesives\nGenericName[cs]=Lepící poznámky\nGenericName[da]=Post-It noter\nGenericName[de]=Klebezettel\nGenericName[el]=Sticky Notes\nGenericName[en_GB]=Sticky Notes\nGenericName[es]=Notas adhesivas\nGenericName[eu]=Ohar itsaskorrak\nGenericName[fr]=Pense-bêtes\nGenericName[he]=פתקים נצמדים\nGenericName[hi]=स्टिकी नोट्स\nGenericName[hr]=Ljepljive bilješke\nGenericName[hu]=Ragadós jegyzetek\nGenericName[it]=Note adesive\nGenericName[lt]=Lipnūs rašteliai\nGenericName[pt]=Sticky Notes\nGenericName[pt_BR]=Notas adesivas\nGenericName[ru]=Sticky Notes\nGenericName[sk]=Sticky Notes\nGenericName[tr]=Yapışkan Notlar\nGenericName[uk]=Липкі нотатки\nGenericName[zh_CN]=\nGenericName[zh_TW]=\nComment=Write reminders on notes\nComment[eu]=Idatzi gogorarazleak oharretan\nComment[uk]=Запишіть нагадування в нотатках\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/Ozon/scalable/apps/xpad.svg\nExec=indicator-stickynotes\nCategories=Utility;TextTools;\nHidden=False\nX-GNOME-autostart-enabled=true\n\nAs you can see, I've changed the Icon entry to the correct path (/usr/share/icons/Ozon/scalable/apps/xpad.svg), but that only changes the launcher icon. How do I change the taskbar icon?\nTo be honest, I don't like any of those task bar icons. The one on the far right should be an ubuntu logo, the speaker icon (on the left of the date) is a blank rectangle (possibly a broken path?) and the battery and networking icons could be slicker. If I could change the battery to that unity-power-panel.svg image I'd be happy. How can I change these taskbar icons to any svg I want?\nAlso, it's worth noting that when I connect, the networking icon changes to a swirling animation, the battery icon has a percentage next to it, and when I get a new email the thunderbird icon has a yellow glow effect around it. \nSo how should I change these icons and keep this behaviour? I'm not asking for step by step guides on these specific (though not esoteric) icons, I just want to know the general steps behind changing these icons, with respect to the fact that they are \"dynamic\" and not just images.\n\nA: I'm the author of the application you referenced.\nThe taskbar icon (nowadays referred to as \"indicator\" in the Ubuntu world), is set within the code itself. The application tries to pull a generic \"indicator-stickynotes.png\" icon file. The system usually searches for this in the current icon theme or (if that fails) in the hi-color theme. You will notice that PPA package installs a monochrome icon in ubuntu-mono-*, and a multicolor icon in hi-color.\nIf you don't like the icon, you can either change the source code or replace the icon.\nIf you do either, you might prefer forking the git repository so you can merge your changes with any changes in the upstream code.\nI believe the other effects you are describing are achieve by changing the icon, but I am not sure. You will want to read about Ubuntu indicators for that.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04: gdigi not working I just installed Ubuntu 15.04 yesterday and I have been trying to get gdigi working with my RP500.

I need to ping Google to see my Internet status. In Windows we use:\nping -t [websitename]\n\nIn the run menu. How do I do this on Ubuntu?\n\nA: As far as I know, on Windows by default ping somesite.net will send 4 ICMP echo request packets to the somesite.net. As you have used the -t option i.e. ping -t somesite.net, this will run indefinitely on Windows i.e. it will keep on sending ICMP echo request packets until you quit it yourself.\nOn Ubuntu ping soemsite.net will run indefinitely i.e. it is same as ping -t soemsite.net for Windows. On the other hand if you want to send a certain number of packets you can use the -c option. E.g., to send 4 ICMP echo request packets you need to open the Terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and run:\nping -c 4 somesite.net\n\nAlso any packet ping sends is highly configurable on Ubuntu. Check man ping to get more ideas.\n\nA: Please open a terminal Ctrl+Alt+T. Enter:\nping -c3 www.google.com\n\nIf you get ping returns, then you are connected.

And why is it running all the time if it's not a real-time addition to ClamAV?\n\nA: As you correctly mentioned: ClamAV is an on-access virus scanner and not a real-time scanner.\nThe ClamAV daemon (clamd) can be used for scanning incoming files automatically, (E.g. mails) without having to scan them manually with ClamAV.  \nExcerpt from the Ubuntu community help wiki:  \n\nLots of programs, especially e-mail servers, can connect to a ClamAV\n  daemon.

Here's why, along with some caveats....\nWith Windows 8.x, Microsoft required that computers based on x86 and x86-64 computers enable users to disable Secure Boot. The option would sometimes be hidden or lurk behind a scary warning, but it was there. With Windows 10, Microsoft has made disabling Secure Boot optional. To date, reports I've seen have indicated that it's still there, so (caveat #1) you may want to review your firmware settings, keeping in mind that the option to disable Secure Boot could be hidden somewhere -- maybe it's visible only after you change another setting, for instance. The key here, though, is that if the option IS missing, and if consumers (that is, you) accept such computers, then Acer, and eventually other manufacturers, will continue (or begin) to deliver computers with this critical feature unavailable. Given the nature of what companies are, the only way you'll catch their attention is with a return; a return costs them money, which a letter of complaint doesn't. If they start seeing returns because users can't get Ubuntu (or other Linux distributions) to boot on their computers, they may pay attention. If they don't see returns or if they don't know the cause of the returns, it will be Business as Usual.\nA second caveat on this is that Ubuntu should support Secure Boot. There are cases where it doesn't work, though, and your description sounds like this is one of those cases. Without having the computer in my hands I can't really diagnose this further. Depending on the nature of the problem, there may be workarounds that would enable you to install Ubuntu even on your computer -- or perhaps I should say that there may be workarounds that would enable me to do it. I maintain the rEFInd boot manager, and added Secure Boot support to it, so I've got expertise in this area that most people lack, and it would take my level of expertise to find and use the relevant workarounds.\nIn sum, there are three possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*You've missed the option to disable Secure Boot. If you can find it, you can install Ubuntu with Secure Boot disabled.\n\n*There's a workaround that would require considerable expertise to locate and use. This level of expertise cannot be expected of normal users, so the computer should be returned as unsuitable for your uses.\n\n*There is no workaround and no way to disable Secure Boot, in which case the computer is 100% incompatible with Ubuntu, and you should return it.\n\n\nIn either of the \"return\" cases, it's imperative that you tell Acer why you returned the computer, so that they're motivated to fix their firmware.\nYou may also want to file a bug report against Ubuntu. As I said, in theory Ubuntu should work on a computer with Secure Boot active. If it doesn't, that's a bug. Be sure to include the exact model number in your bug report. (Acer's Web site shows several \"E1\" models.) In fact, I'm curious enough that I'd like to know the exact model myself.\n", "Q: How to restore lib folder?

Please help.\n\nA: A detailed file-by-file investigation could probably fix this problem with precision. That requires a great deal of expertise, though. Running the Boot Info Script, posting the RESULTS.txt file to a pastebin site, and posting the URL to your document here can get you started down this path; however, this will be a tedious process and there's no guarantee you'll find a solution.\nThree other relatively easy options come to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-install Ubuntu and hope that whatever created the problem doesn't recur. This is a reasonable course of action if this is a fresh install; however, if you'd previously been booting and it's suddenly failed, you presumably have personal data files that you don't want to risk in this way. (It's possible to re-install without damaging your personal files, but there are too many ways in which this can go wrong for me to blithely suggest that you attempt it.)\n\n*Run the Boot Repair tool on your computer. This tool analyzes your installation and attempts to repair Ubuntu boot problems automatically. It often succeeds, but its success rate is not 100%. If you can't boot at all right now, it's unlikely you'll make matters worse; but if you can boot another OS in some way, there's a slim chance that Boot Repair will interfere with that boot.\n\n*You've included the UEFI tag. If you're booting via EFI, or even if you've got an EFI firmware but are booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, you can download and prepare the CD-R or USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager. If Secure Boot is disabled, you should then be able to boot rEFInd, and it should enable you to start Ubuntu. You can then either attempt to repair your GRUB installation (by re-installing the GRUB package, doing a sudo update-grub, or otherwise analyzing and fixing the problem) or install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package to bypass GRUB and its current problem and use rEFInd instead. This approach is unlikely to create new problems, since it involves making no changes to your hard disk until you've already successfully booted Ubuntu; but it applies only to EFI-based computers, and even then there are a number of situations in which it won't work.\n\n\nNone of these approaches is guaranteed to work, but there's a good chance that one of them will help you out.\n\nA: It looks like your linux installation is not complete or somewhat broken.\nPossibly you have everything except appropriate boot commands installed, in which case you can try manually locate your appropriate vmlinuz-xxx, initrd-xxx files, load them into memory with linux and initrd commands, and boot with boot.\nFor reference, check out available commands at http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Commands and try to locate your original grub.cfg with ls, and look into it with cat command to find out what options you have to append to linux command after vmlinuz-xxx filename.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hint: set pager=1 helps you to use cat with long text files.\n\n*Hint2: files on other partitions can be referred as (hd0,msdos2)/dir/file, changing 0 and 2 to appropriate disk and partition number.

My question is: how does one determine \"the right directory?\"  I can't seem to find the answer in the docs and man pages on my installation, or with more than ten hours of googling.  Anyone care to enlighten?  Fwiw, I'm running trusty.\nI've edited this query to more accurately quote the instructions that had me confused.  Being more familiar with tarballs than with .deb files, I had assumed that the contents of the .deb file would be placed relative to my current directory, the one from which I executed dpkg.  It seems the instructions meant to say: \"...change to the directory where you saved the .deb file...\" or they could have simply said: \"...execute dpkg -i pathname-to-.deb-file\".\nThanks for clearing that up; I'm glad I didn't waste any more time chasing down another blind alley.\njimo\n\nA: There is no \"right location\" for the .deb file.

Then, I just want the PC normally boot on linux, without any \"missing boot device\" or anything.\n\nA: It should be booting after Boot Repair has done its thing. You've probably got a defective EFI on your hands. I recommend you check your manufacturer's site for an updated EFI (it will probably be called a \"BIOS update\" or something similar). If you find one, update the firmware and then try running Boot Repair again. I don't actually hold out much hope that this will work, but it might. One complication with this advice is that you may need to be booted into Windows to update the firmware, so you may need to get it working well enough to boot before you can do this. Other times, though, you can update the firmware using the firmware's own setup utility -- you'll just need to write the setup files to a USB flash drive from another computer.\nIf that doesn't work, then my next suggestion is to disable Secure Boot, download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager, prepare a boot medium, and boot with it. This should enable you to boot either Ubuntu or Windows. Boot Windows, open an Administrator Command Prompt window, and type:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nThis creates a boot entry from Windows, which is occasionally more reliable than doing the job from Linux. If it works, you can re-enable Secure Boot.\nIf that doesn't work, then my (almost) final suggestion is to run Boot Repair again, but enter the Advanced menu and select the option to back up and rename boot loaders. (I don't recall the precise phrasing, but it should be obvious.) Run the repair with that option selected. This enables an ugly hack to work around the ugly EFI bug that's causing your problem.\nReally, though, if you have to resort to that last option, your computer is broken. As in, broken so badly that it should be returned to the manufacturer as defective. If the computer is new enough to qualify for an in-store return, I suggest you do just that, then write to the manufacturer to report the reason for the return. Without such returns, and knowing the reason for them, manufacturers will continue to ship broken firmware.\n", "Q: changing directory in bash script file I've spent to much time in the DOS world where cd.. (no space) works.\nI tried to do the same in ubuntu by defining a bash file in /usr/local\n/bin called \"cl..\"\nits body is \n#!/bin/bash\ncd ..\n\nI have chmod +x on the file.\nIt doesn't work, ubuntu doesn't complain about command not found.\nwhat did I do wrong?\n\nA: The unix shell scripts are quite different from DOS bat files in a sense that they are executed as separate processes, not just loading commands into current command prompt, as it is with windows cmd.exe\nWhat you really want, is actually bash alias or function.\nBoth alias cd..='cd ..' and cd..() { cd ..; } will do the trick, first one defines alias, second a shell function.\nIn order to make it available in succeeding shells as well, it should be written in to .bash_profile, .bashrc or .profile file in your home directory. Which file exactly, depends on your distribution settings, check man bash, /etc/profile and /etc/*bashrc for details.\nman bash will help you further with available commands.\nIf you are looking for more user-friendly shell than bash, then I suggest you to look into zsh package.\n", "Q: unsuccessful sudo apt-get update not working still new to Linux and trying out Ubuntu.

The short answer is:\necho 80 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop/battery_care_limiter\n\nThe long answer is, if you look at the available options in the Windows 7 version of the Sony Battery Care application you will see that the only available options are to set the charging limit to 50, 80, or 100. The other value that works is 0, which from what I can tell turns off the battery care function and allows the battery to charge to 100% or as much as it can hold.\nSo, using the code example above, echo <number> where \"number\" = 0, 50, 80, or 100 will give you the effect you're after.\nNote: This works on my Sony Vaio Model VPCEB15FM running Ubuntu 18.04, your mileage may differ.\nAdditional Info:\nUnder the folder /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop/ there are some other options as well.  What I noticed is that several of these files have similar data/parameters as the Windows 7 version of the Sony Battery Care application. It looks like these can be used to do similar tweaks.  I haven't looked at them all, but here is a short list with some notes.\nbattery_care_health\nAlways 50. For some reason can't be changed even after doing a chmod.\nHowever, for some reason, it did reset to 0 after the battery completely discharged.\nbattery_care_limiter\n0 - starts charging immediately.\n50, 80, 100 seem to be only valid settings\nthermal_profiles\ndisplays \"balanced performance\" which is the same choices in Windows Vaio Care\nthermal_control\ncurrently \"balanced\" which is the same setting in Windows Vaio Care\nlid_resume_S3\nlid_resume_S4\nlid_resume_S5\nall these are 0. probably have something to do with init/load/boot states\ndriver_override\ncurrently \"(null)\"\npanel_id\ncurrently \"7\"\nmodalias\ncurrently \"platform:sony-laptop\"\nuevent\nDRIVER=sony-laptop\nMODALIAS=platform:sony-laptop\npower\nfolder with some more settings.

I do not if I should use php or just a batch to make a connection to the data base and save the information,  but I do not know how to do neither of this posibilities.\nHelp please.\nBye.\n\nA: This is easily done in Python. First, learn how to get your CPU's temperature here. Either use the sensors command or the cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp to write the current temperature to a temporary file curr.temperature. You can do that seperately in a bash script or in the Python program itself, using:\nfrom subprocess import call\ncall ([\"/path/to/script/get_temperature\"], shell=False)\n\nThen the Python code just needs to read the file curr.temperature and store the value in a MySQL table. I have not tested this code, but it should be something like this:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport MySQLdb.cursors\nwith open('curr.temperature', 'r') as f:\n    read_data = f.read() \ndb = MySQLdb.connect(db='databasename', host='localhost',\n                     port=3306, user='MySQL-username', passwd='password',\n                     cursorclass=MySQLdb.cursors.DictCursor)\ncur = db.cursor()\ncur.execute(\"INSERT INTO temperatures VALUES (now,\" + read_data + \")\" )\n\n", "Q: when i open terminal is a blank screen.

Then I shutdown the PC and restart it and the cursor is gone but still working ( can right click ) but it is invisible.\nWhen I remove a monitor, then restart PC, the cursor is visible again.\nCan somebody please help me?\nThank you and sorry about my English.\n\nA: My cursor is going away sometime on one of my monitors.\nUsing \"Change of user\" and logging back makes it visible again, without a need to reboot or close all my session.

I tried everything I could think of to fix the issue (updating/changing drivers, switching out monitors/mouse, updating OS, restarting lightdm).  Nothing seemed to work.  Then a coworker told me he solved the problem by setting the HDMI monitor as his primary monitor in BIOS following a BIOS update.  That odd configuration change solved the issue.  Updating the BIOS without the config change did not solve the issue.  I suspect Intel will fix this issue in the near future.  \nOf note, I was using your same solution involving a PC restart with only one monitor connected as my initial solution.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I have tried all the driver changes posted here and elsewhere.  Non of any of that helped.  So, I went back to an old trick someone showed me once.  When all else fails:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut your pc down.\n\n*Unplug your pc.\n\n*remove the pc's battery.\n\n*Wait 30 minutes then reverse what you did.\n\n\nShazaam!  It worked!  This seems to be a fix to most of my pc issues.  I suppose it allows garbage that accumulates in ram to disappear.  Good luck!\n\nA: Go to: All Settings / Displays\nThen select third monitor (Unknown Display), set it to OFF and click Apply.\nCheck the cursor, if everything is fine then click Keep This Configuration.\nThat solves this problem for mee on Ubuntu 14.04, 15.10 and 16.04.\n", "Q: Sabnzbd+binary newsgrabber: service not enabled, ubuntu SABnzbd+ binary newsgrabber: service not enabled, edit /etc/default/sabnzbdpl\n\nThis message shows up in my terminal.

That means, if you wanna ssh into our computer, you need the server, which you can get with sudo apt-get install openssh-server.\n\n*ssh by default runs on port 22. If you try any other port, connection will be refused. So once you have ssh server, you can just ssh username@localhost, and that will direct you to port 22 by default. Now, if you want to enable ssh login on port 2222, you will need to enable port forwarding. Especially since you are using virtualbox. \n\n\nA: Note, that 127.0.0.1 aka localhost is your local machine. Usually at this point you use the IP address or hostname of the remote host.\n\n\n*\n\n*First install the ssh server and client on your target host and your local host\nsudo apt-get install ssh\n\nA configuration isn't necessary.\n\n*Per default SSH is listening on port 22, therefore use\nssh user@127.0.0.1 -p 22\n\nor\nssh user@127.0.0.1\n\n\n*Or reconfigure the port for the ssh server (target host)\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nand change \nPort 22\n\nto\nPort 2222\n\nreload the configuration\nsudo service ssh force-reload\n\nand connect via\nssh user@127.0.0.1 -p 2222\n\n\nA: It looks that you don't have either:\n\n\n*\n\n*sshd daemon running inside a VM, or\n\n*port forwarding configured correctly\nFor 1. you need to check whether sshd server is running on a vm by for example checking with VB console that service ssh status returns that is active and running. If not run sudo service ssh start.\nFor 2. you can check if VB is listening on that port. You can do that by checking all open ports in LISTENING mode. sudo netstat -anp | grep -w LISTEN should include port 2222 (assuming you're using linux as a host OS).\nYou should have something like this in output:\ntcp     0    0 0.0.0.0:**2222**             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1564/sshd \n\n(in this case the sshd process is listening on port 2222)\nAdditionally you should tell us what is your network configuration inside VB. Without it it's hard to tell whether command you're using is right.\n\nA: The following set of command will solve the problem for Ubuntu 18.04\nEnter the following commands in the terminal:\nsudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server\n\nNow check with:\nssh localhost\n\nThis will work.\nAnd if you want then again install openssh with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install open-ssh\n\n\nA: Using below command worked for me.\n$systemctl start sshd.service\n\n\nA: It's all because of ssh error so I suggest you to reboot the machine and log-in again. \nAfter log-in just open \ncmd =$vi /etc/crontab  \n\nand add    \n*/5 *  * * *   root    service ssh restart\n\nNow for every five minutes ssh service will restart and would troubleshoot all the ssh errors.\n\nA: run command \ngrep \"^[^#;]\" /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nand check parameter \n\nGSSAPICleanupCredentials yes\n\nif it is no, then update as yes and retry\n\nA: The default port is 22. Using ssh xxxt@127.0.0.1 -p 22 -i ~/.ssh/xxx should work.\n\nA: You should be sshing to the loopback address (127.0.1.1) for ubuntu not 127.0.0.1 IMO: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/146028\n", "Q: How to prevent the dimming of my desktop picture when enabling icons on desktop?

Is there a way to install java with apt-get?\n\nA: Before I start, please note that the JDK also contains the JRE within it.\nMethod 1:\nTo install the openJDK JDK and JRE 8 use (replace 8 with the version you want, such as 7 or 6):\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk\n\nMethod 2:\nIf you instead want to install the official Oracle JDK and JRE and definitely want to install through apt-get then do (you can replace the 8 with other versions such as 9, or 7):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\nMethod 3:\nOr if you want to install the official Oracle Java version manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go here and click the download button:\n\n\n*Select the Accept License Agreement radio button (once you have read the license agreement).\n\n*Select the file you want to download, if you are running on a 32-bit machine click jdk-[javaversion]-linux-i586.tar.gz ([javaversion] replaced with the Java version, such as 8u60), if 64-bit then jdk-[javaversion]-linux-x64.tar.gz.\n\n*Launch Terminal (CTRL + ALT + T), then cd to the directory where you downloaded the file to (probably ~/Downloads), and run tar -xvf /path/to/file.tar.gz to unpack that archive into the directory the file is in, you may then move that unpacked archive into a desired location, such as the /opt directory (storing executable files in your home directory is a security risk).\n\n*Once you have done the above you may delete the original .tar.gz file, and then open up your ~/.bashrc file in a desired file editor such as gedit or vim, I will be using vim in this example (install it with sudo apt-get install vim if it is not already installed). So run vim ~/.bashrc and then insert two new lines at the bottom of the file which read (that is with /path/to/unpacked/archive replaced with the path to the archive you just unpacked):\nJAVA_HOME=/path/to/unpacked/archive\nexport PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin\n\n\n*Either restart Terminal or run source ~/.bashrc to start using the new .bashrc file.\nNote: With this method you will have to carry on doing this every time there  is a new Java version released which it will not notify you about.\n\nA: Open terminal and type  \nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre\n\nThis package contains the Java Runtime Environment\n\nA: Open 'Terminal' and type\nsudo apt-get update\n\nand then:\nfor Java Development Kit:\nsudo apt-get install default-jdk\n\nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/default-jdk/\nfor Java Runtime Environment\nsudo apt-get install default-jre\n\nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/default-jre/\n\nA: There is a portable version\nhttp://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u60-b27/jdk-8u60-linux-i586.tar.gz\ndownload and extract to home folder\nhave links to java and javac at$HOME.\n", "Q: libarb.so & libflint.so.13: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory I installed arb and try to run this code:\n#include \"arb.h\"\n\nint main()\n{\n    arb_t x;\n    arb_init(x);\n    arb_const_pi(x, 50 * 3.33);\n    arb_printn(x, 50, 0); printf(\"\\n\");\n    printf(\"Computed with arb-%s\\n\", arb_version);\n    arb_clear(x);\n}\n\nBut in terminal I got this error\"\nerror while loading shared libraries: libarb.so:\ncannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nHow can I solve this problem?\nI searched and there is a libarb.so in /usr/local/lib.\n\nEdit: \n‌Answers helped me and that error was solved but another one shown now:\nerror while loading shared libraries: libflint.so.13: \ncannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nThere is a link to libflint.so.13 in /usr/local/lib, but is seems my QtCreator project cannot access it (probably because its name does not end with .so).\n\nA: Your libarb.so is not in your library path.

Like I said I can browse what ever is inside /home folder but just can't seem to write.\n\nA: Permissions in Samba are a mix of Samba permissions and unix permissions.  In your case, I suppose the directory /home was already created when you decided to share it.  Only, it belongs to a specific user (normally 'root').  You must then grant all users (Unix) write access to that directory.\nYou can do it by using the Java file manager in webmin, by selecting the /home directory and clicking the 'Information' button.  There, modify as appropriate.  \n", "Q: Can Encrypted external drive encrypted on/by ubuntu work with Windows?

It works fine after I change it in display settings. \nHowever, whenever I restart my PC, they're back to the wrong configuration. Is there a file I can edit that will force them to a certain configuration?\n\nA: Monitor configurations on second monitors, as set in Monitors, often are not remembered after restart.\nWith the script below, you can define which of your monitors should be the left one on startup. It will top alline both monitors in a left/right setup.\nThe used commands are xrandr commands to position the screens in the spanning area of the two screens (see the link in \"Notes\").\nScript to set up left/right monitor on startup\nSince the commands to run depend on the current situation and which of your screens you actually want to have on the right/left, you'll need a script to check your screens, their horizontal resolutions, create the correct commands and automatically set up the desired situation on startup. \nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\nleft = sys.argv[1]\n\n# get the data on screens and resolutions, parsed from xrandr\ncurrent = [l.split() for l in subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()]\n# find the name(s), x-res of the screen(s)\nscreens = [\n    (l[l.index(\"connected\")-1], [s.split(\"x\")[0] for s in l if s.count(\"+\") == 2][0]) \\\n    for l in current if \"connected\" in l\n    ]\n# set up screen positions from left to right (important)\nif left == screens[0][0]:\n    subprocess.call([\"xrandr\", \"--output\", screens[0][0], \"--pos\", \"0x0\"])\n    subprocess.call([\"xrandr\", \"--output\", screens[1][0], \"--pos\", screens[0][1]+\"x0\"])\nelif left == screens[1][0]:\n    subprocess.call([\"xrandr\", \"--output\",  screens[1][0], \"--pos\", \"0x0\"])\n    subprocess.call([\"xrandr\", \"--output\",  screens[0][0], \"--pos\", screens[1][1]+\"x0\"])\n\nHow to use it\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as setup_monitors.py\n\n*Open a terminal window, run the command xrandr\n\n*In the output, two lines (if your second monitor is connected) will contain the names of your \"connected\" screens. The names look like: DVI-I-1 or VGA-0. Make an educated guess which is the one you want on the left.\n\n*Run the script (from a terminal) by the command:\npython3 /path/to/setup_monitors.py <left_screen>\n\ne.g.:\npython3 /path/to/setup_monitors.py DVI-I-1\n\nTest the command on both screens. The screens will black out for a second and be configurated.\n\n*If all works fine, add a command to your Startup Applications: choose Dash > Startup Applications > Add the command\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && python3 /path/to/setup_monitors.py DVI-I-1\"\n\nNote\n\n\n*\n\n*The sleep is specifically needed for xrandr commands when a second monitor is involved. If the script (actually the commands inside it) run too early, the desktop is not fully loaded yet and the commands will either break or miss their target.\n\n*See also here for more info on what the command(s) inside the script are doing.\n\n\nA: Jacob's solution works but there are some additional alternatives. You could put the xrandr commands in your .xsessionrc file, so that they're executed at startup. You could also just write an xorg.conf entry to set your monitors explicitly left/right of each other. I'm not at my PC so I'm regrettably short on details at the moment, but will come back to fill them in later if I get time. In the meantime it would be worthwhile for you to read up on both xrandr and xorg.conf files in general; you might discover a better solution than what I end up putting here anyway. ^_^\nEDIT: OK I'm finally getting around to this.\nUsing xrandr and ~/.xsessionrc\nThe xrandr utility is used to both get and set information about your displays. Type xrandr by itself on the command line and you'll get a listing of all your displays and the \"modes\" that they support. Here is some example output corresponding to an old Dell 4:3 LCD.\nDP2 connected 1280x1024+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 338mm x 270mm\n   1280x1024      60.0*+   75.0  \n   1152x864       75.0  \n   1024x768       75.1     60.0  \n   800x600        75.0     60.3  \n   640x480        75.0     60.0  \n   720x400        70.1  \n\nYou would add modes to these if your monitor's resolution isn't right, etc., but your problem is about positioning. xrandr provides simple parameters --left-of <output> and --right-of <output> that allow you to dictate where your displays sit in relation to each other.\nSo let's say your displays identify as FOO1 and FOO2. (They never will; this is just an example.) If you want FOO1 to be always on the left of FOO2, you would enter:\nxrandr --output FOO1 --left-of FOO2\n\nor\nxrandr --output FOO2 --right-of FOO1\n\nTyping this on the command line will immediately make the change for your current session. Inserting the same line into your ~/.xsessionrc file will make the change effective every time you start X.\nUsing xorg.conf\nYour other alternative is to write an xorg.conf entry that will dictate display configuration as part of the X startup process. If you're on Ubuntu then this will likely be part of a file in an xorg.conf.d directory, either at /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d or /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d. So if you don't already have one, create a config file to drive your display adapters and monitors. I called mine 01-monitors.conf to ensure it got executed first. Reusing the previous example with FOO1 being to the left of FOO2, we can set up the same preference here with a Monitor config section.\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier \"FOO1\"\n    Option \"LeftOf\" \"FOO2\"\nEndSection\n\nNote that the Identifier is the same one you'd get from xrandr.\nFurther Reading\nThe man page for the xorg.conf configuration system is available at http://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.7/doc/man/man5/xorg.conf.5.xhtml\n", "Q: copying a file from a USB storage if it exist with udev rules I have a simple udev rule to match USB storage devices which runs a simple script that looks for a file in the USB. I'm using the usbmount package in order to automatically mount the USB. As the documentation says, the USB devices will be mounted to /media/usb{0..7}.\nWhen the USB storage device has been detected I run this script\n#!/bin/bash\n\noptions=(\"usb0\" \"usb1\" \"usb2\" \"usb3\" \"usb4\" \"usb5\" \"usb6\" \"usb7\")\n\nfor dir in \"${options[@]}\"\ndo\n    lookup=\"/media/$dir/luah_v2_version.zip\"\n\n    if [ -e \"$lookup\" ]; then\n        cp $lookup /home/luah\n        exit 0\n    else\n        echo \"could not find $lookup\" >> /home/luah/log\n    fi\ndone\n\nThe thing is that when the script is ran automatically after the USB was connected, it results in a log file where it says that the file could not be found in any of the directories above (while it does exist). When I then manually run the script it works and copies the zip file to where I wanted.\nI've tried to set a wait time before the script executes of 10 seconds to see maybe the USB was not mounted by the time the script ran but I get the same end result.\n\nA: Probably usb has not been mounted at the time your rule is processed. Try adding a hook to the usbmount i.e. create a file named /etc/usbmount/mount.d/10_autocopy.sh\n#!/bin/sh\n[ -f $UM_MOUNTPOINT/luah_v2_version.zip ] &&  cp $UM_MOUNTPOINT/luah_v2_version.zip /home/luah\n\nthen make it executable:\nchmod +x /etc/usbmount/mount.d/10_autocopy.sh\n\nvariables set for mount scripts (/etc/usb/mount.d):\n\n\n*\n\n*UM_DEVICE: mounted device\n\n*UM_MOUNTPOINT: mount point of the device\n\n*UM_FILESYSTEM: filesystem type\n\n*UM_MOUNTOPTIONS: mount options\n\n*UM_VENDOR: vendor string of the device\n\n*UM_MODEL: model or product string\n\n\nvariables set for unmount scripts (/etc/usb/umount.d):\n\n\n*\n\n*UM_DEVICE: mounted device\n\n*UM_MOUNTPOINT: mount point of the device\n\n*UM_FILESYSTEM: filesystem type\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*all scripts are by default executed as user root.\n\n*usbmount uses the syslog facility if VERBOSE=yes - /etc/usbmount/usbmount.conf\n", "Q: Installation and Permissions Standards This is more of a general Ubuntu newbie question.  (14.04 LTS, btw)  I’ve built and used my Ubuntu box solely as a development machine to (re) learn coding – mostly java.  I have two primary issues:\n1)  I can’t find any advice on a standard directory to install programs, so I’ve tended to use either /opt/ or /usr/lib.  Is that ok?\n2)  I seem to run into recurring problems with file and directory permissions when trying to install/use applications.  \nFrom what I’ve read, there is no ‘standard’ for installation directories (and apt-get seems to do it’s own thing), so what do experienced folks do?  Any good practices you can recommend?\nThe permissions problem consistently gives me the irits, and I usually end up going into the terminal and sudo the hell out of everything, or using chmod/chown.  But, I think this kind of defeats the purpose of having these permissions.  Is this a common issue, or did I miss a step when I built my box?  Or, worse yet, did I somehow screw up my standard permissions?\nFor example, I installed eclipse and spring (STS, roo and security).  To do the spring security tutorial, I had to install tcserver, so I put it under /opt/.  However, I couldn’t set it up or start it through eclipse until I changed the ownership permissions on the entire install and server directories.  This can’t be normal.\nThat said, I installed maven without a hitch.\nThanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*if your software is going to be used by OTHERS and you do not use a debian installer (ie. tar.gz, with either source or compiled software) it is called a \"3rd party application\" and the program should be installed in /opt/{softwarename-versionnumber}/ and offer that as the default installation directory. \nIf this software is intended to be installed with a debian installer (ie. a DEB) files should  be placed in the default location as described in How to understand the Ubuntu file system layout? Ubuntu/Linux installers use this lay-out and tend to enforce this method when you want to package and share your software through the default method of installing (Ubuntu software center)\nIf the software is just for your own purpose I myself would use /opt/ or a directory with \"local\" (those are dirs for software/binaries you create for yourself and for your own machine, not intended to be shared,) in it but it is up to you to decide.\n\n*software installed in /opt/ will be installed by the admin and by default set to \"root\" using \"sudo\". The easiest way to change the permissions is to change owner and group (chown -r $USER:$USER) if you have a single user machine. If it is a multi user system the same can be done u but the group (the 2nd $USER in the previous command) needs to be one that includes all those users.\nThere should be no need to have to use chmod; the software in /opt/ should already come with sane defaults and all the permissions set correctly!  Mind that some software installed in /opt/ can ask for a user to use and set the software already for that user. \n\nFrom what I’ve read, there is no ‘standard’ for installation directories \n\nThe Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is a pretty good standard and is a widely accepted method for Linux operating systems. And is maintained pretty well (the next big change will be a separation such that we can have a read-only filesystem for / and partitions that hold the writable part of the installation.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.4LTS file creation I just finished installing Lubuntu 14.04 LTS and I think it is a great OS.

I have heard that to run non-native Steam games on Linux you have to have a separate Steam installation running in Wine for each game, and that you can't just install Steam once in Wine and then have more than one game installed through it that runs.\nIs this the case? If so, then is it the fault of Steam, WINE, or both? Is this something that the responsible party is looking into and planning to deal with, or is this something that cannot be resolved? And why is this the case?\n\nA: As hbdgaf says, no, it doesn't.\nHowever:\nRunning games on Wine is a tricky business at best. It may well be the case that a setting/tweak for one game would cause problems for another. That's why it's just saner to run individual apps in different WINEPREFIXes. Even though you can set application-specific overrides in winecfg, IIRC that's for DLLs.\nIt's also easier to reproduce your settings if you want to get some particular game up and running on another system. That's why PoL uses separate prefixes - the scripts use specific versions of Wine and exactly those tweaks which are needed to the get the game running.\nThus, Steam doesn't require anything of you, but the game you're trying to run may well force you to use a separate WINEPREFIX because of a conflict with tweaks for another game you have.\n\nA: It doesn't.  It only requires a new install of steam if it's in a new winedrive like when you're using playonlinux.  If you just read the PoL install script and install all the same winetricks in one winedrive - you don't need more than one winedrive or more than one install of steam.\ne.g. - I have about 5 games installed in one winedrive, and then I use this to launch that steam/winedrive:\n$ cat ~/bin/payday \nexport WINEPREFIX=/home/schadenfreude/PlayOnLinux\\'s\\ virtual\\ drives/Payday2\ncd ~/PlayOnLinux\\'s\\ virtual\\ drives/Payday2/drive_c/Program\\ Files/Steam\nwine Steam.exe\n\n\nA: No, you can put several games on a single wine prefix. Most of your games you should be able to put in the same prefix.\nHowever, if the games require different wine environments, you will need to put them in separate prefixes.  (For instance, ones that require Microsoft .Net and ones that require 64bit installs currently cannot be placed in the same prefix.)\n", "Q: How to report kernel issues This is a followup to this other thread: USB ports not working all of a sudden\nI'm working on an Acer Aspire E 15, with the OS being Ubuntu Studio 14.04.\nI noticed that the last kernel version:\nLinux version 3.13.0-63-lowlatency (buildd@lgw01-18) (gcc version 4.8.2 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) ) #103-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT Fri Aug 14 22:23:32 UTC 2015\n\nThis one is giving certain issues to my computer (USB ports don't work).

Shutdown, put nVidia graphics card back into the system and reconnect the monitor cable. The only issue is what to do after a reboot.\nOne option is to use \"nomodeset\". When the system boots, and shows grub menu (use shift key if it does not), select 'e' in order to open edit mode and add \"nomodeset\". Start Ubuntu, login into the new installation and set the option permanently in /etc/default/grub file. Add \"nomodeset\" like in this line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\nAfter modifying the file, run \"sudo update-grub\" in order to apply the change.\nThis solution worked for me.

So, if you have a Ralink RT5370, as your lsusb log indicates, you should use the Ralink driver indeed. The Realtek driver will not help you in any way with this.\n\n*To find out what driver you need you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*look at the device itself. Most of the time you'll find a very good identification printed on it. Google is your friend.\n\n*use the tools in your computer like lsusb, lsmod or lspci. Google for the device ID's.\n\n\n\nIf you build your driver from source, and it does not build with your actual kernel version, try building with another kernel version. With linux it is really easy to switch kernel versions at boot. If you need help to install an older kernel version, follow this post to Install older kernel version.\nif you positively identified that you have a Ralink RT5370\nYou probably should follow the instructions from here, here or here.\nif (and only if) you have a RealTek 8188:\nTry this from google code.

I would not think that you have a virus, but the only way to know would be to scan. I have used clamav for that purpose in the past.\nWhy exactly nautilus is having this problem I cannot tell, wiser souls will have to answer this one.\n", "Q: How to change language only for terminal I'm using Arabic as the default language but there are some issues when displaying it in terminal.

This is because as if you have not provided any input file, sort will take the input from STDIN.\nWhat you need is, e.g. if the input filename is foo.txt :\nsort -r -k 2 -o mayflies.txt foo.txt\n\nThis will save the sorted output of foo.txt into mayflies.txt. If you omit the -o mayflies.txt portion the sorted output will be shown on the screen (STDOUT).\nOn the other hand, if your input and output filenames are meant to be the same file i.e. if you want to save the output to the same file :\nsort -r -k 2 -o mayflies.txt mayflies.txt \n\n", "Q: \"rm: not found\" by apt, cron and others For some reason I get this error all the time in system scripts:\nrm: not found\n\nFor example I wanted to update the system:\nSetting up install-info (5.2.0.dfsg.1-6) ...\n/usr/sbin/update-info-dir: 52: /usr/sbin/update-info-dir: rm: not found\ndpkg: error processing package install-info (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 127\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n install-info\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nIt has nothing to do with the package \"Install-info\".

I currently have it on my laptop and really enjoy it. I am running 15.04 on there. I started out with 14.04, but it updated to 15.04 a while ago.\nI was curious, what is the difference between the LTS download and the 15.04. I understand that there is only support for 15.04 until January 2016, but what does that mean? Wouldn't there be an Ubuntu 16.* before then?\nIsn't it just a matter of downloading the update to the next version and waiting? No reformatting? I don't remember having to backup data or anything when I did the update on my laptop. It just took a while and eat my internet data up.\nI'm in school to become a computer network technician, so I love to use all of the latest software and would prefer to have 15.04, but not if it means that I will have to reformat after January 2016, as I have read in other online threads.\n\nA: You have everything correct there.\nUbuntu that is not LTS has support only for 8 months or so, after which support is dropped - no more updates or bug-fixes. However, you can upgrade to the latest release - keeping all of your data, without requiring a backup (although doing so would be a good idea).\nThe advantage over LTS is that you get the latest software without too much trouble, with the downside being that you'll need to upgrade every six months or so.\nMy advice is to install 15.04, since you'll get the newer versions of software and can upgrade easily, with no hassle.\n\nA: I strongly advice you to stick with LTS. It just crashed my 14.10 while distro upgrading to 15.04. My data now seems away.\n\nA: When a new Ubuntu version comes out you can update your 15.04 by following the instructions in this post. \nMost of the time it is just as easy as typing sudo do-release-upgrade in a terminal window and then wait.\nNo, you don't have to format your existing installation. It does make sense however to back up you data before you upgrade, because there is always a risk that something breaks.\nI administer a number of Ubuntu servers and I always use the LTS version. The reason for that is that I don't want to upgrade my servers every 6 months and I don't need the latest-and-greatest. I want a stable configuration and as little churn as possible. Any down-time costs money.\nSome of our developers also use the LTS version for those reasons, other developers always update to the latest version so they can use all the latest features.\nWhat version you should use depends on what the intention is of your Ubuntu installation and personal preference.\n", "Q: High level overview of how SSH works and is setup on Ubuntu I'm just starting out with SSH and I need somebody who's knowledgeable on SSH on Ubuntu/Linux to give me the whole picture of working with SSH.\nI currently know that SSH is used to securely connect to a computer over a network and then be able to execute commands on that computer from your workstation's terminal.\n\nWith the default setup on a clean Ubuntu 14.04 desktop install, I try to connect to an Ubuntu server (also clean install, no extra packages) with the ssh command and the ip address of the server:\nssh larryserver@192.168.0.3\n\nWith that I get the message \"connection refused\".\nHaving read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH I understand that only a ssh client (openssh client specifically) comes installed with Ubuntu and a ssh server does not.\nI then install the openssh-server package on the server machine and repeat the above command, which then allows me to enter the password for the larryserver user on the server machine. I'm in.\nWhat I would like to know about ssh besides what the ubuntu help page can teach me is where ALL of the important files are located that have to do with ssh on Ubuntu and what they are used for.\n/usr/bin/ssh\n\nThe file above, that's the binary that executes when I type the ssh command into the terminal correct?\n\nIf openssh is A client & server for ssh then what tells the ssh command that this client/server config is in use? If I installed a client and server package that is not openssh, how does the ssh command use those instead? Or does the ssh command only use openssh?\nThanks!\n\nA: \nWhat I would like to know about ssh besides what the ubuntu help page can teach me is where ALL of the important files are located that have to do with ssh on Ubuntu and what they are used for.\n\nSee manual page for ssh(1) and sshd(8). There is chapter called FILES, where you can see all files related to ssh and sshd (ssh server).\n\nThe file above, that's the binary that executes when I type the ssh command into the terminal correct?\n\nYes\n\nIf openssh is A client & server for ssh then what tells the ssh command that this client/server config is in use?\n\nWhen you run ssh in debug mode (ssh -vvv remote_host), you will get much more information about what is going under the hood, including the configuration files used.\nIf you mean the invoking ssh, it is basic *NIX stuff and it is handled by $PATH environment variable.\n\nIf I installed a client and server package that is not openssh, how does the ssh command use those instead? Or does the ssh command only use openssh?\n\nDo you have some example of \"other client and server\" for ssh? Last time I remember, openssh has around 80% \"market share\".\nBut I don't see any problem with other package providing binary placed in the same path instead of openssh. It is just C code compiled into binary format placed in /usr/bin/ folder.\n\nA: \nI'm just starting out with SSH and I need somebody who's knowledgeable\n  on SSH on Ubuntu/Linux to give me the whole picture of working with\n  SSH.\n\nSSH is Secure SHell - a network protocol implemented by various programs that allows machines to communicate. openSSH is a implementation (others can be found here) - one of the most popular ones though.\n\nWhat I would like to know about ssh besides what the ubuntu help page\n  can teach me is where ALL of the important files are located that have\n  to do with ssh on Ubuntu and what they are used for.\n\nYou can see some of the 'important' files by looking at the filelist for the package (n.b. you can check the package directly, you don't have to use the online filelists) - most other files important to the package are included in dependency packages listed here (e.g. for libssl).\nMuch of the stuff is compiled (so you can't really see what it does looking at the file), if you want to know what it is doing you may be able to get some idea of what it does from the source code |1| |2|\n\n/usr/bin/ssh\n\nThe file above, that's the binary that executes when I type the ssh command into the terminal correct?\n\nUsually yes. Depends on the $PATH |1| |2|. If ssh executable is later in the path that may be executed instead\nWith the above two points you can learn more about the package etc. by examining:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard - there's a place for nearly everything - bin for executable binaries, /etc for configuration etc.\n\n*The Client Server model |1| |2| (where the server waits for things from the client, and processes them)\n\nHaving read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH I understand that\n  only a ssh client (openssh client specifically) comes installed with\n  Ubuntu and a ssh server does not.\n\nThats because not everyone wants something (which has a open port that can be connected too) running on their machine that allows others to access it remotely - like Windows running no firewall :) (there is also the principle that more points of access are harder to secure). The SSH client is useful as it can be useful without being much of a pain otherwise.\n\nN.B. I know some of this stuff, feel free to criticize  :D\n", "Q: System started freezing frequently Since a couple of days ago I am experiencing a lot of freezes and I do not know how to investigate them.\nIt does not matter what I do - browsing, playing music, typing on LaTeX - at some point (after 2 minutes, 10 minutes or even after 1 hour) the computer freezes.\nIt becomes unresponsive to anything, the LED on the Caps Lock starts blinking and it stays like that forever.\nEven the \"magic\" REISUB does not work (I enabled it to try to avoid corrupting my HDD with these frequent hard shutdowns).\nThe only thing that works is to long-press the power button and force shutdown.\nI had a look at the log files in /var/log with no help (nothing gets registered).\nThis is my hardware.\nI am on 15.04 with kernel 3.19.0-29-generic.\nI tried to revert to old kernels with no help. In particular, 3.19.0-28-generic has the same problem.\nAny hint on how to investigate this further?\nPS: With Windows 8 there is no problem, even with intensive gameplay, so I would tend to exclude hardware problems.\nPPS: temperatures also are not a problem, I was able to monitor them with sensors via a terminal.\n\nA: The blinking caps lock is probably caused by a kernel panic, more info here. Look for log files as instructed here to debug this. It seems like there should be something related in /var/log/syslog.\n\nA: Since the system became impossible to use, I reinstalled it.\nAfter testing for a couple of says, it seems that the problem is solved.\nMaybe I changed some configuration files in the previous setup that caused the error after some update.\nIn case the problem comes back I'll update this question.\n\nA: I had the same problem and it seems to be related to kernel 3.19.0-29. I am pretty sure about it because I began to experience it from sept.11 (the same date you reported), and that's the date the new kernel was installed in my PC. If I use kernel 3.19.0-28 it does not freeze anymore.\n", "Q: atk6-flood_router26 wlan0 makes network crash I was watching a video on youtube on a network attack. Wanting to try this on my own network with my Ubuntu 15.04 laptop and a Windows 10 virtual machine, I just did a sudo apt-get install thc-ipv6 and then a sudo atk-flood_router26 wlan0, and well this made my internet connection to stop. I had to reconnect to my wireless network again, in order for the internet to work, this shouldn't be happening should it?\n\nA: When you use flood_router26, this is exactly what is supposed to happen, crash a network. What were you exactly wanted to do?\n\nA: The flood_router26 will crash the whole network in my experience, it'll even affect my Linux machines.\n", "Q: Change HPLIP appindicator icon I'm using a HP Printer and the app indicator icon form hp-systray doesn't quite fit with the Ubuntu Ambiance theme. I don't like disabling the indicator either.\n\nSo is there a way to change it to a flat monochrome icon like the language indicator in the screenshot? Or is there an icon theme that includes this icon?\nAnd is it Ok to change it? I couldn't find relevant information online and I'm thinking no one tried and shared this because HP terms say:\n\nThe HP Logo should not be altered in any way.\nDo not:\n...\n\n*\n\n*Change the colors of the logo;\n\n\n\nA: The HPLIP panel and toolbox icons can be found at /usr/share/hplip/data/images/, where there are folders for a variety of icon sizes. One may change the names of the stock icons by appending \".old\" to each file name, then simply copy your desired icons into their respective folders (renaming each according to the original).\n\n(Note that changing the stock icon names and otherwise editing within these folders will require root privileges. Use gksu nautilus, for example, in a terminal; or sudo your renaming and copying commands directly. Do be careful when making root changes within system folders.)\nSome icon packs do contain suitable replacements (Captiva is pictured, https://github.com/captiva-project/captiva-icon-theme), but I'm not aware of a ready-made monochrome set. You may be able to create your own with Inkscape or Gimp.\nI'm not aware of HP actively prohibiting home users from customizing the appearance of their Desktop icons. I think their team has been great to provide Linux support; I suspect they'd understand that you're not aiming to undermine their brand or flaunt violation of their policies by bringing aesthetic harmony to your PC.\n", "Q: Can't delete old /usr files (moving /usr to new partition) I'm following this answer to move my /usr directory to a different partition.

Maybe your router cannot redirect ports, so then reconfigure your Apache config to then use the same non-standard port.  Then try accessing your server from an external computer.\nYour router and/or modem may have trouble doing hairpin routing as well.\nYou might be better off getting a free micro instance from Amazon if you want to tinker with web servers.  You can also get free servers from MS on Azure as well.\n\nA: The first thing you need to do is try connecting from another network using your IP address, connecting from the same network using a public IP will not work, try using your phones 3g network if that makes sense. From your response it seems you have correctly configured the /etc/apache2/ports.conf and your virtual host file as it is serving the pages locally, @darren may be right that at time the isp or router manufacturer use port 80 and 8080 to access the management interface and that may not work, you will need to set port forwarding and it should work. Just tested it on my virtual box. You will need to open up the port in your firewall though.\n", "Q: Encrypting External HD Taking Forever I'm using LUKS to create an encrypted partition on an external hard drive, and I'm going to use this hard drive just for storage and backing up files, not for dual-booting or anything.

There's only one of those \"processing\" wheels spinning around that shows the external hd is doing something, but I have no idea what kind of progress it's making, or if it's making any progress at all.\nShould I prepare myself to let this thing continue encrypting overnight, or has something gone horribly wrong? Is there any way I can figure out how much longer this is going to take? I don't think it's frozen but this is taking far too long. \n\nA: It can take a long time - it is encrypting 2TB of \"random\" data to prime the drive.  This is much safer than using the drive plain particularly if it had data on it from before.\nI can't give you a better idea how long it will take - it will vary heavily based on CPU power, USB speed and drive speed.

I was worried I was gonna have to reinstall ubuntu. \nI went and manually edited /var/lib/dpkg/status and removed the entry that was made by the checkinstall. \nOnce that was removed I went to /usr/local/bin and removed all the python 3.5 stuff. I also made sure that python3-4 was still in /usr/bin/. Then I did a sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a and finally a apt-get -f install and there was only 1 thing that was 'missing' which was python. \nThen I managed to get it installed the right way by following the instructions in the README and then just removing the symlink to python3.4 and created a new one to python3.5.\n\nA: I had the same problem after installing python3.4 with checkinstall (instead of python3.5 for electrometro)\nReason why this problem occurs\nI discovered why this problem did occurred on the first place.\nWhen creating the .deb file from the Python 3.4 source with checkinstall that then installs it, the default package-name set up by checkinstall is \"python\". \nAs a consequence, checkinstall uninstall the package named python before installing the new one using dpkg!! This package already exists in Ubuntu. It is basically linked to python2! For some reason hopefully, I think that dpkg tries to remove the version of python that you are installing, i.e python3.4 in my case but fails. That is why python2 is still installed. But dpkg still believe \"python\" package was removed and replaced by the new one installed (python3.4).\nThe file /var/lib/dpkg/status has been edited accordingly. In my case here is the updated related to this installation:\n\nPackage: python \n  Status: deinstall ok installed \n  Priority: extra \n  Section: checkinstall \n  Installed-Size: 167520 \n  Maintainer: root@laptop \n  Architecture: amd64 \n  Version: 3.4.3-1 \n  Provides: python \n  Description: Package created with checkinstall 1.6.2` \n\nAs you can see in bold, the Package name is \"python\" and the package has been \"deinstall\" before being installed again.\nThus, dpkg thinks that \"python\" (python2!) no longer exists and suggest you to remove everything that is dependent to it when you call apt-get -f install!\nSolution to avoid this problem:\nSimply choose a different \"Package\" name and \"Provides\" name when using checkinstall! For example python3.4-checkinstall for both.\nHow to solve the problem when it already occured\nTo solve this mess, I have a solution that enable you not to have to remove all installed binaries manually as electrometro suggested to do, which I think might be dangerous.\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually edit the Package name python in /var/lib/dpkg/status from python to python-3.4-checkinstall for example. Be careful. The new name must not have been used already! Also change \"Provides\" to the new name.\n\n*Use sudo dpkg-reconfigure python-3.4-checkinstall. (Note: dpkg-reconfigure -a as suggested electrometro does not exist anymore in Ubuntu 16.04. It is anyway not needed).\n\n*Run apt-get -f install that will install the original python package again! At this point you can stop here but if you try sudo dpkg-query -L python3.4-checkinstall : dpkg does not know which files have been installed anymore!!! Because the file /var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.4-checkinstall.list does not exist! The file /var/lib/dpkg/info/python.list have been overriden by apt-get -f install. See the Debian documentation for more info on dpkg. To solve this issue, you must do the step 4.\n\n*Reinstall python3.4 from scratch using checkinstall but without forgetting to change the \"Package\" name and the \"Provides\" name as suggested earlier! Use the same name as in step 1. No need to delete the binaries manually before doing so. The point of this step is to have a clean installation of python3.4 and be able to uninstall it using the newly created .deb file.\n\n\nAnd that's it! Everything should be clean now. I actually ran step 3 before step 2 but it should be cleaner to do it this way.\nFor info the step I used to install python3.4 from the source package using checkinstall are the folowing:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the source directory, run ./configure.\n\n*Run make\n\n*Run sudo checkinstall\n\n*Most important step. At this point they ask you if you want to modify any field before installing. Modify \"Package\" and \"Provides\" from \"python\" to a different unique name (like \"python3.4-checkinstall\" as I suggested).\n\n\nHope it helps!\nCheers,\nNicolas\n", "Q: How to get steam icons in the Ubuntu dash?

This is a small box computer that I got surplus for a \"song\" and want to use it for my son (5 yrs old).  I had played with Linux years and years ago (like 10 - 15 yrs - Mandrake, Lindows, and Suse ~ but I was just playing).

We have a \"test bed system\" of 4 servers only (not 7). \nHow do we get this to work with\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-ubuntu-openstack using only 4 servers?\n\nA: This should be possible with the currently released Autopilot.  If you select Ceph for both object and block storage then 4 machines should be sufficient.  Be aware that you'll need at least one machine with two NICs for the network gateway in your cloud (one NIC on the same Network as the other machines as the cloud, and one for external access).\nYou'll also need to limit the overhead of MAAS and Landscape to one machine, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MAAS on a machine\n\n*Install Landscape in a VM on the MAAS machine\n\n*Register the MAAS server in Landscape\n\n*Navigate to Landscape's OpenStack tab and follow the instructions\n\n\nA: Personally, I manually installed most of the services for OpenStack on a single node using the syntax:\njuju deploy --to lxc:0 *servername*\n\n...in most cases.  This will create LXC containers on that first node.  So basically, you end up putting all these services on the first node [noting the machine number in square brackets]:\n\n\n*\n\n*juju-gui                 [0/lxc/0]\n\n*mysql                    [0/lxc/1]\n\n*keystone                 [0/lxc/2]\n\n*glance                   [0/lxc/3]\n\n*cinder                   [0/lxc/4]\n\n*nova-cloud-controller    [0/lxc/5]\n\n*openstack-dashboard      [0/lxc/6]\n\n\nAnd then deploy three ceph nodes:\njuju deploy -n 3 ceph    [1], [2], [3]\n\nAnd a ceph-osd node:\njuju deploy ceph-osd     [4]\n\nAnd the first compute node:\njuju deploy nova-compute [5]\n\nSo that's six computers (nodes) so far.  You can always \"juju add-unit nova-compute\" later to add another node to the compute list.\nYou'd actually like to include three of the ceph-osd nodes, to be honest.  It helps make that work better for the sake of redundancy.  Take note of the configuration variables that set the minimum quorum size to match your node count.\nOf course, this is a simplified syntax above since in some cases you reference a configuration file.  And then you'd want to run the series of \"juju add-relation x y\" commands to bind together pairs of services.  Having the juju-gui up first allows you to visually see what's going on.\nIMPORTANT!  Cinder seriously DOES NOT WORK in Icehouse if you use a block-device that's defined locally (if you're trying to omit ceph, for example).  Every time I tried this cinder failed with a hook error at the config-changed step.  It can't create that local block device and fails.  Trust me, I've spent weeks trying this without ceph and it simply doesn't work.  Ceph requires a quorum of three nodes minimum so you're stuck with a minimum install I've described.  You might be able to deploy ceph-osd to lxc:0 again on that first node but I couldn't tell you if that will work--I'm still struggling with re-commissioning some of my nodes at this point and dealing with the bootstrap-timeout errors.\n", "Q: Permissions question for drupal site in var/www I want to do local Drupal development on my Ubuntu machine.

Type ls -l /var/www/html or the path you get and check the listing there, use sudo touch /var/www/html/try.html to create a blank file in this default document root. Browse this file through your browser on the computer with http://localhost/try.html if it still gives 404 that means your config files need to be checked. Please report back the sites-available, the errors and path info you get.

After lengthy analysis I found how it was breaking.  \nAlthough some parts of the below answer are specific to the Dell Edge / hostapd config, it's still worth reading as it gives great insight into how/why a soft block is thrown.\nShort Answer: Soft blocks occur when processes collide accessing radio\nie: NetworkManager is using the radio because it controls the GSM wwan0 interface. But when hostapd tries to access the radio via the wlan0 IF which is NOT managed by NetworkManager because they don't play well with each other- they come into conflict.  NetworkManager greedily covets the radio and if anything else tries to use it, NetworkManager spitefully throws a soft block\nAlthough the solution may sound obvious- uniformly manage radio access within one interface management system- this is not so straight forward:\n\n\n*\n\n*NetworkManager as noted above is to be avoided when using hostapd\n\n*systemd-networkd can neither be used with hostapd. After realizing NM couldn't be used to manage the wlan0 interface, when I tried to config systemd-networkd instead, I found that wouldn't work either:  ERROR: wlan0: networkd does not support wifi in access point mode\nWhen using hostapd for your AP, the WiFi IF (usually wlan0) should be raised using ip commands AFTER and NM finished (and ensure nothing else restarts NM).  I found doing a rfkill unblock all before and after raising the wlan0 IF with scrripted IP commands cleared the soft block allowing the wlan0 IF to start correctly which inturn allowed hostapd to start normally on reboot.\nLong Answer:\nSome specifics as to how I arrived at my conclusions in the short answer above.\n\n\n*\n\n*IF Management: For their Edge gateway, Dell has enabled in their 18.04 image BOTH systemd-networkd AND NetworkManager, but in Netplan defaulted the IF management to the later.  You'll remark a standard 18.04 install only has systemd-networkd as the default for IF management. \n\n*The wrapper for configuring an AP with hostapd \"create_AP\", unhooks the WiFi interface from NM control and uses ip link set commands to raise the WiFi IF (line #1697 in above link). Although \"_create_ap)\" was part of Dell's 16.04 image, it's no longer present in the 18.04 image leaving the user to manually config the AP.  This is where the fun begins\n\n*Having configured the GSM interface wwan0 successfully within NM, I configured the WiFi IF wlan0 in NM also.  This failed for the same reasons \"create_ap\" and Arch Linux unhook it as I later found in the prev referenced links for NM.   So per the Arch Linux instructions, I added the directive unmanaged-devices=mac:<hwaddr> for the wlan0 in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf to ensure NM didn't cause any further havoc with it.\n\n*Realizing NM was a non-starter for configuring hostapd, I next configured the wlan0 IF to be managed by systemd-networkd.  However, the following error puked revealed that wouldn't work with hostapd either: ERROR: wlan0: networkd does not support wifi in access point mode. I was quickly losing the will to live.  Had I not turned in my Glock when I left NYPD I probably would have self-harmed...\n\n*Neither NM or systemd-networkd being an option to manage the wlan0 interface, I was only left to configured it ip commands.  And this worked- MANUALLY.  However, on reboot, the soft block was thrown, despite unhooking wlan0 from NM.  So if NM isn't throwing the soft blocks now, what is?!?!?\n\n*Further analysis revealed NM was still in play. I found dhcpcd.service had a NM hook when it started, so a restart of the dhcpcd client would get NM rearing it's ugly head.  ps aux revealed this was happening: /sbin/dhclient -d -q -sf /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-dhcp-helper -pf /run/dhclient-eth0.pid\n\n*I discovered that anything that caused NM to kick-in would cause the soft block to be thrown.  So in my scripts I removed anything that called for NM to restarted or anything that called for dhcpcd.service to be restarted.  But yet the problem STILL PERSISTED.\n\n*Although manually raising the wlan0 IF succeeded in allowing hostapd to rise-up correctly, a reboot caused the soft block which will stop the wlan0 IF from starting until it's cleared.\n\n*So the only solution I was able to arrive at was to raise the wlan0 IF AFTER NM had finished and ensure nothing else restarted NM once wlan0 was up. In my scripts I added a rfkill unblock all both before and after the start of the wlan0 IF using ip commands.  THIS FINALLY WORKED.\n\n*You might think: \"Terrence, why not try to moderate the behaviour of dhcpcd.service in its' unit file rather than hacking in scripts!\" Preferring elegant solutions to hacks, I looked into this: it's not possible to persistently edit that dhcpcd.service as the file is dynamically generated and doesn't persist across reboots!! Execute find / -name dhcpcd.service and you'll see the unit files describing this service exist in /run. Crack one open and you'll be told: # Automatically generated by systemd-sysv-generator\nCommands I scripted to stop NM from hogging the radio :\nsed -i \"/managed=true/a unmanaged-devices=interface-name:$INTERFACEAP\" /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nnmcli radio wifi off\n\nCommands I scripted to raise the wlan0 IF using IP commands, independent of both NM and systemd-networkd:\nrfkill unblock all\nip addr add $IPV4IPWLAN0 dev $INTERFACEAP\nip link set $INTERFACEAP up\nrfkill unblock all\n\nAlthough I've got hostapd finally working, I'm going to therapy 7 days a week now and my therapist says I'm progressing well to get over the experience.  Anyhoo, hope I saved others from this living hell...\n\nA: In the kernel cmdline put rfkill.default_state=1. This works irrespective of the init-system and doesn't require ugly script hacks.\n\nA: I just added a start-up programs entry to block wifi. enter image description here\n", "Q: How do you install the VirtIO HDD drivers for KVM on Windows 7?

Usually I would open the Gnome terminal and go to script path and start the Perl script. The Gnome terminal stays open throughout. It was working fine for 6 months. But for the past three days, It is not working properly. Gnome terminal is closing automatically and so the Socket program. The next day morning I again opened the terminal and ran the socket program, then again the terminal has been closed overnight. I could not find any solution in the web. Need help in resolving the issue\n\nA: Run your program in screen. Just install screen, open your terminal and type \"screen\". From that moment on everything you do will be inside of a persistent 'screen' that doesn't depend on whether the outside shell is closed.\nIf your terminal is closed, you can  open a new one and re-attach the screen.\nIf I write programs that need to run like this (I will usually start them remotely through ssh) I usually write in a check, so that the program refuses to start unless it's running in screen (check if the environment variable STY exists). That way I can't accidentally run the program outside of screen.\n\nA: It is possible to start the program in background (your script might need some alteration if it is not possible) with ...\nnohup {program} > {program.out} 2>&1 & \n\nThe output from program will be redirected to {program.out}. If you change the \">\" to \">>\" it will append the output instead of writing over the previous time it was used.\nThat would eliminate the need for a terminal session. Besides that it will also trap error messages you might have missed due to the terminal session being killed/stopped. \n\nA: Press CTRL + ALT + F2 and sign in with your user-name and password.\nRun the command from there and it shouldn't close.\n", "Q: howto change voice in festival in my /usr/share/festival/voices/english....I have kal_diphone folder which is English male voice but now I want to change English male voice to female voice so ..I downloaded \" cmu_us_clb_arctic-0.95-release.tar.gz ...then followed following step ...\ncd /usr/share/festival/voices/english/\nsudo tar jxf cmu_us_clb_arctic-0.95-release.tar.bz2\nsudo ln -s cmu_us_clb_arctic cmu_us_clb_arctic_clunits\nsudo cp /etc/festival.scm /etc/festival.scm.backup\nsudo echo \"(set! voice_default 'voice_cmu_us_clb_arctic_clunits)\" >>  etc/festival.scm\n\nerror is bash : /etc/festival.scm : permission denied...\n\nso I used the following command =\ngksu gedit /etc/festival.scm\n\nafter that /etc/festival.scm file is opened and then at the end of file I typed\n(set! voice_default 'voice_cmu_us_clb_arctic_clunits)\n\nand then I saved it\nafter that i typed festival on terminal it has given following error :\nSIOD ERROR: unbound variable : f2b_f0_lr_start\nclosing a file left open: /usr/share/festival/init.scm\nfestival: fatal error exiting.\n\nso i again opened /etc/festival.scm and removed that\n(set! voice_default 'voice_cmu_us_clb_arctic_clunits)\n\nand then it started to work...so please tell me how to change voice from male to female... \n\nA: I have the same error with the same voice_cmu_us_awb_arctic_hts voice (on Raspberry Pi's port of Ubuntu).\nI specifically need that Edinburgh-accented voice rather than any of the others in that package (which I haven't even downloaded - space is limited on the RPi)\nThe error doesn't happen if you substitute 'kal_diphone' for 'us_awb_arctic_hts'.\nDoes this help?\nroot@hive0001:/home/pi# fgrep f2b_f0_lr_start /usr/share/festival/voices/english/cmu_us_awb_arctic_clunits/*/*.scm\n/usr/share/festival/voices/english/cmu_us_awb_arctic_clunits/festvox/cmu_us_awb_arctic_f0model.scm:  (set! f0_lr_start f2b_f0_lr_start)\n\nFOUND IT!

I have not tested it and I am not able to do so as I have no such key.\nTo use your key in Linux, you must change the access rights to allow your account to access it. To do this, simply add a udev rule to the card. Create a file named /etc/udev/rules.d/10-security-key.rules with this content:\nSUBSYSTEMS == \"usb\", ATTRS idVendor {} == \"2581\" ATTRS idProduct {} == \"f1d0\", MODE = \"0660\", GROUP = \"un_de_vos_groupes\"\n\nYou can specify any of the groups used by your account.

After plugging it in, I found out that the drivers for Linux are not native on Ubuntu. They do, however, have the drivers available for download (in the form of compilable/ makefile). What I am not sure of is how to install these drivers. I know that I need to build the drivers, place things where they need to be, and tie things together with the kernel. I am not sure how to do this, however, and need some help.\nTL;DR: I need to know the terminal commands to install these drivers.\nDriver/Device info:\nhttp://www.tp-link.com/en/download/Archer-T2UH.html#Driver\nOutput of lsusb:\nBus 003 Device 004: ID 148f:761a Ralink Technology, Corp.\n\n\nA: I have a TP-Link T2U Wi-Fi adapter and I was in struggle to find a working driver for Ubuntu 18.10. All the drivers, original and modified, was for previous version of the kernel but nothing useful for the 4.15 kernel. After a painful morning I found a working link to run the TP-Link T2U on the latest kernel.\nHere is the link: Trying to fix the MT7610U chipset driver - GitHub\nAfter following the instructions everything worked! I found the link on TP-LINK Archer T2U v2 - WikiDevi.\nIf you would install the driver you will need to compile the source. To do this you will need install git and clone the repository in your home directory.\nsudo apt install git\ncd ~\ngit clone https://github.com/xtknight/mt7610u-linksys-ae6000-wifi-fixes.git\ncd mt7610u-linksys-ae6000-wifi-fixes\n\nYou can avoid to write the whole directory just type the first letters, for example, mt7610, and press the Tab key.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\nmake clean\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nAfter these steps the device should work. If you want the driver to work after the updating the kernel I advise to follow the next steps that includes the dkms utility. You will need to work in the directory \"mt7610u-linksys-ae6000-wifi-fixes\" otherwise the process will not work.\nsudo apt-get install dkms  \nsudo cp -R . /usr/src/mt7610u_sta-1.0\nsudo dkms add mt7610u_sta/1.0\nsudo dkms build mt7610u_sta/1.0\nsudo dkms install mt7610u_sta/1.0\n\nI hope to be useful for the further development of this OS.\n\nA: Connect to internet by wire, then run in terminal\nsudo apt-get install git build-essential\ngit clone https://github.com/Myria-de/mt7610u_wifi_sta_v3002_dpo_20130916.git\ncd mt7610u_wifi_sta_v3002_dpo_20130916\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA\nsudo cp RT2870STA.dat  /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/RT2870STA.dat\n\nReboot.\nThe dongle should work. The only problem is that you will have to re-install it after each kernel upgrade.\nBut if you keep the driver folder mt7610u_wifi_sta_v3002_dpo_20130916, then it will be quite easy.\nYou will need to run only\ncd mt7610u_wifi_sta_v3002_dpo_20130916\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nafter a kernel upgrade.\nIt is also possible to install it using DKMS. In this case it will rebuild automatically on kernel upgrades.\n", "Q: Distorted wallpaper upon login after updating to 15.04 After I upgraded from 14.10 to 15.04 now whenever I log in, My wallpaper becomes distorted and a series of black and white hyphen-like bars appear vertically on the right edge of the screen.\nThis is talking about the same issue but does not provide any solution.\nThis is also a discussion to the related problem but I couldn't find my solution.\nIs it a display driver issue or a configuration issue? how can I fix it?\nRegards,\n\n\nA: A clean install will solve your issue.

I recently found a question on superuser regarding ejecting a CD using the Windows command line.\nHow can I do this using Linux terminal?\n\nA: The eject command does what you want. Without any arguments provided, it ejects the default (first) 'cdrom' device. If you want to eject a specific device, provide it as an argument.\neject /dev/cdrom1\n\nQuoting from the eject manpage (man eject):\n\nEject allows removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape, or JAZ or ZIP disk) to be ejected under software control. The command can also control some multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject feature supported by some devices, and close the disc tray of some CD-ROM drives.\n  \n  The  device  corresponding  to  is ejected.

I like the closing icons very much, but the blue is a killer for night work.\nLink: http://www.noobslab.com/2014/08/polar-night-dark-gtk-theme-for-ubuntu.html\n\n\nA: There are a few alternatives to the polar night theme:\n\n\n*\n\n*Noobslab - Ambiance Dark Red - red can be a good choice for a night theme, though generally with computers background lighting is a great idea.\n\n*Arc Dark - blue but cool.\n\n*Delorean Dark - still mainly blue though (gnome-look)\n\n*Sable Themes Suite - available in range of colors - also on DeviantArt.\n\n\nAlternatively, you could also replace the theme colors (warning: can be lengthy and boring process). These are defined by hex strings such as #8EC3EB. So you can search \nTo do this a while ago I created a rough script to find them in files - it can be found here and can be used like this:\nfind /home/wilf/Downloads/polar-night-master/ -type f -exec /path/to/scriptfolder/grephexcolourcode {} \\; | sort -u\n\nWhere /home/wilf/Downloads/polar-night-master/ is where the theme files are located, and /path/to/scriptfolder/grephexcolourcode is where the script is located (or just grephexcolourcode if it is in the $PATH).\nYou can then replace the colours using sed or similar - e.g:\nsed -i 's/#8EC3EB/#EB8E8E/g' /path/to/theme/file\n\nOr using find and replace in a program such as Gedit, BLuefish etc\n\nAn alternative is to use a normal dark theme (usually blueish - I use Arc-Darker), and then on top of that at night use something like redshift-gtk to make it more bearable at night. You can launch it with a command similar too:\nredshift-gtk -l 55.7:12.6 -t 5700:3600 -g 0.8 -m randr -v\n\nIt will automatically change to be more red at night. This covers the entire screen, so works too with light areas themes can't effect easily (e.g. most webpages, documents etc) but due to blue light being filtered blue things will turn dark so not ideal for graphics work or some themes.\n", "Q: How do I remove the Nvidia logo on boot without using a xorg.conf?

Also when I open gParted it shows as 2 devices and not 1 with 2 partitions.\n\nA: It looks like you have two partitions on your drive.\nThe simplest way to fix that is to delete the partitions and create a new large partition that uses all the space, but this will delete any data you have on the stick so make sure to back it up first.  The bold text is what you should write, the regular text is output in the terminal:\n$ **sudo fdisk /dev/sdc**\nCommand (m for help): **d**\nPartition number (1-2): **1**\nCommand (m for help): **d**\nCommand (m for help): **n**\nCommand action\n  e  extended\n  p  primary partition (1-4)\n**p**\nPartition number (1-4): **1**\nFirst cylinder (1-x, default: 1): **<RETURN>**\nUsing default value 1\nLast cylinder of +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (1-x, default x): **<RETURN>**\nCommand (m for help): **w**\n\nNow you should have a clean partition using the entire USB drive.

The problem is, when I start the chrome, all the windows are open on current workspace (I am using 4 workspaces). What I need to do is to move each window to specific workspace. I need to select window by it's ID because title of the window might be always different (depending which tab is on focus).

Is there a way to select window by part (last 3-4 digits) of it's ID (it seams that last 2-3 digits are always the same when I start the window right after reboot), or to select e.g. 7th window from the list? The reason I need this is I want to write script that will start all required applications (Chrome, Apache, SublimeText...) and move windows to specific workplaces (I have one workplace for e-mail/Facebook, one for music and one for work stuff).\nPS: Please do not suggest using system hibernation - it is not an option for me because of some driver issues.\nPS2: I am using Ubuntu 15.04\n\nA: How to identify specific windows of Chrome\nIf the windows are always created (on startup) in the same chronological order (as you mentioned in a comment), you can use a specific property of the output of the command wmctrl -l: The list always lists the windows in the order they were created.\nThat means that if you have (e.g.) three windows, re- created in always the same order, you can simply first filter out the windows, belonging to Chrome, then \"mark\" the windows by their order as their appear(ed) in the output of wmctrl.\nHow to filter out Chrome windows from wmctrl\nTo identify windows, belonging to an application, you need to use the command:\nwmctrl -lp\n\nwhich will also show the pid the window belongs to. Usually, this is a single pid. In the case of Chrome however, there will be several. \nThe procedure, programmatically, is then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the pids of Chrome by running:\npgrep chrome\n\n\n*Run the command:\nwmctrl -lp\n\n\n*parse out, per window, the pid the window belongs to and look for a match in the output (list) of pgrep chrome \n\n\n*This will produce a list of windows, belonging to Chrome. Their identification, as mentioned, then is their order in the list. All you need to do then is parse their window id (the first string in their line in the output of wmctrl -lp that you ran) and you're done.\nSubsequently, use the usual command to move the windows to the desired workspace.\nAn example; the test\nAs an example script to test if this works (python, what else :))\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\n# get the list of pids of chrome\npids = [p for p in subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"chrome\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()]\n# get the list of windows\nwindows = [l.split() for l in subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()]\n# filter out the windows of chrome, parse their window-id\nmatches = [w[0] for w in windows if w[2] in pids]\nprint(matches)\n\n# raise the window\nsubprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-ia\", matches[0]])\n\nFor this example, I opened three Chrome windows, closed them as you described and opened Chrome again. \nIn matches[0] (last line), I made it raise the first window of the list:   \n['0x05600001', '0x05600039', '0x0560003a']\n\nOn the next run, the window id's changed: \n['0x05800001', '0x05800039', '0x0580003a']\n\nbut their order in the list remained, since (indeed) the windows are always created in the same (chronological) order. Therefore the last line of the script: \nsubprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-ia\", matches[0]])\n\nalways makes the same (first) window raise, while\nsubprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-ia\", matches[1]])\n\nwill always raise the second and so on.\nReplace the raise- command by the move- command and you'll have your script work.\n\nA: So I was able to solve the problem using Python. And please keep in mind that this is my very first Python script so it is not perfect.\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport subprocess\n\nfoo=subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lx\"])  #list windows with WM_CLASS\ndef f1(foo=foo): return iter(foo.splitlines())\nlist=list(f1());\ngloop=0  #google loop - to count google windows\nsloop=0  #sublime loop - to count sublime windows (currently only one, but I might add more in future)\ngoogle = [ [\"0\", \"0\"], [\"2000\", \"0\"], [\"2000\", \"2000\"],  [\"2000\", \"0\"] ]  #google windows positioning\nsublime = [ [\"2000\", \"0\"] ]  #sublime windows positioning\nfor s in list:\n    if (s[14:20]=='Google'):\n        #print \"Google\"\n        windowid=s[0:10]\n        windowpos=\"0,\"+google[gloop][0]+\",\"+google[gloop][1]+\",-1,-1\"\n        subprocess.call([\"wmctrl\", \"-r\", windowid, \"-i\", \"-e\", windowpos]);\n        gloop+=1\n    if (s[14:20]=='sublim'):\n        #print \"Sublime_text\"\n        windowid=s[0:10]\n        windowpos=\"0,\"+sublime[sloop][0]+\",\"+sublime[sloop][1]+\",-1,-1\"\n        subprocess.call([\"wmctrl\", \"-r\", windowid, \"-i\", \"-e\", windowpos]);\n        sloop+=1\n\n", "Q: Can't get Kdenlive icon onto desktop Have Ubuntu 14.04. loaded Kdenlive from the Software Center.

I went to UEFI mode of windows. Then I disabled the Widnows secure boot option and selected the primary boot as USB. However it starts the windows again rather booting from USB. I tried multiple times but run out of luck. Any suggestion? I really appreciate your help .. Thanks \n\nA: Did you use the recommend program to write ISO to USB from the ubuntu download page ? \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nTrying going back into your bios and set it to default, you don't need to change the boot priorities. Once your lenovo reboots, hit the \"enter\" key and then a blue dialog box should be present. Scroll down to the option which states something along the lines \"boot from other / change device\".\nFrom there you should see all the available devices to boot from, try the first usb option, if it doesn't work, repeat the steps and select the 2nd usb option.\n*I currently have a lenovo T430s running 14.04.3LTS\n\nA: USB devices require the boot loader to be stored as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on a FAT partition. This is the \"fallback filename\" for EFI-mode booting; it's what the firmware looks for when a boot loader entry is not present in NVRAM (as when booting an OS installer). A standard Ubuntu installation, OTOH, makes the assumption that it's installing to a hard disk, and that it can store a boot loader path in NVRAM, so it doesn't use the fallback filename, and instead installs GRUB as EFI/ubuntu/grubx.64.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP), and stores Shim (used for Secure Boot compatibility) as EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi.\nTo get your USB installation to boot, you must mount its FAT partition (ESP) and rename EFI/ubuntu on it to EFI/BOOT, then rename shimx64.efi in that directory to bootx64.efi. (If you want to boot without Secure Boot, you could instead rename grubx64.efi to bootx64.efi; but renaming Shim should also work in this case.)\nNote that these filenames assume an x86-64/AMD64 (64-bit) system and installation. 32-bit EFI installations are rare, but require changing x64 to ia32 in all filenames.\n\nA: You need to go to boot menú, to access turn off laptop ande select button next to the power charger slot and one time in boot menú disable legacy on boot and change to UEFI. Save changes and reboot the will appear Ubuntu startup menu.\n", "Q: how to deactivate apparmor profiles which i deleted ah I deleted the profiles for some of my programs. now i want to deactivate them but no avail. \nwhen first i try to disable the profile for example by \nsudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.tcpdump\n\nI encountered error which says something like line 1 :unexpected symbol ...\nso i removed the relevant profiles from apparmor.d but still profiles were enforced. then I try to put profiles in complain mode by aa-complain now obvious error is can not find profile.\nany way to come out this situation\nI am using ubuntu 14.04 on 64 bit machine \n\nA: after deleting profiles, I restarted my system.

I found that a directory with following ls output in my system:\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 username   root  4096 Jan 14  2015 DIRNAME\n\nIt rose a question for me: Is there any restriction between files owner and group? I mean that each user in the system belongs to predefined group(s). Is it possible to assign a \"group\" to a file/folder that the file user (owner) does not belong to?\n\nA: \nIs it possible to assign a \"group\" to a file/folder that the file user (owner) does not belong to?\n\nCertainly. For example:\n$ sudo ls -l /var/spool/cron/crontabs\ntotal 8\n-rw------- 1 muru     crontab 1136 Jul 21 12:30 muru\n-rw------- 1 root     crontab 1090 Jan 20  2015 root\n\n$ groups\nmuru adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare\n$ groups root\nroot : root\n\nAs you can see, neither root, nor muru, are members of crontab, yet the crontab files' group owner is crontab.\n\nIs there any restriction between file's owner and group?\n\nNone at all1.\n\n1Well, there are restrictions on each individually: the UIDs and GIDs have to be 32-bit integers (IIRC), or the username and group names must exist:\n# touch /tmp/foo\n# chown 1000000000:2000000000 /tmp/foo\n# ls -l !$\nls -l /tmp/foo\n-rw-r--r-- 1 1000000000 2000000000 0 Sep 15 09:04 /tmp/foo\n# chown gibberish:garbage /tmp/foo\nchown: invalid user: ‘gibberish:garbage’\n\nBut, no, no relation between owner and group.\n", "Q: Why such long list of users and groups in my system? On my laptop $ cat /etc/passwd | wc -l results 42!\nAnd cat /etc/group | wc -l results 70!!  \nThe only user of my laptop is myself and there is only an extra user named \"guest\". But why such large number of users and groups are available?\n\nA: In short: privilege separation. Many different services and subsystems have their own user and group. Doing so enables fine tuning of the access rights for each user. Such a system also serves to enhance security. For example, if an intruder, or app/script with malicious code in it, makes it to be recognized as a user with root privileges, the entire system could be compromised.\n", "Q: Upgrade from Ubuntu 10.10 to 14.04.3, apt not recognizing new install of python 2.7.9 I am running Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS on a Dell T410 server, having upgraded from 10.10 (Maverick) earlier today.

You have the Precise version installed. Therefore start\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThis should upgrade the package and some others. Alternatively, we can force the installation of version 0.3ubuntu12 via\nsudo apt-get install command-not-found=0.3ubuntu12\n\n\nThe command\nsudo make install\n\ninstalls no packages. Therefore apt can't see the installed version.\nIf we have repaired your installation (therefore answer in progress), you can install the package later as follows.\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\ncd ~/Downloads/Python-2.7.9\nsudo checkinstall\n\n", "Q: how to edit (or delete) sources list in commandline (no text editor, cannot install any new packages on limeted install) I am running lubuntu (actually kodibuntu) as my server. whilst attempting to add a package there was an error in the sourceslist. config rendering synaptic package manager useless.\nI cant change the file as a have no text editor installed (and no way to install one it seems); (I really only have chrome browser that is gui).\nWhat is the simplest way to either edit the file in the command line or remove it. I have enabled the root account but am not 100% confident that i will not do something stupid such as make root the owner of my home directory without having gksu nautilus installed. \nis there a command to undo a change in sources list? I could boot a live cd and edit the file but again this would have me tapping commands in as root and probably break the whole system.\nif somebody could point me in the right direction it would be appreciated, even just some way to install a text editor. would nano be installed? thanks   \n\nA: Pretty sure, you will have terminal editor called nano installed.\nYou need to edit sources.list file with root privileges so run it with\n$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nNow you can change the contents the same way as in graphical editor (apart from using mouse to move cursor - you need to use arrow keys).\nWhen you're finished press Ctrl+x and then y to save changes and exit.\nA side note: don't be afraid of running commands as root - your Linux will not do anything beyond what you will write in console yourself. And to know what you're doing you need to know at least basic commands. If you don't know what a command does - use man [command]. For you to change ownership of your home dir to root, you'd have to execute chown command, so no danger here :)\n", "Q: Problem closing a program with upstart in 14.04 This is the code:\ndescription \"NZBGet upstart script\"\n\nsetuid martin\nsetgid martin\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\n\npre-start script\nexec /home/martin/nzbget/nzbget -D\nend script\n\npre-stop script\nexec /home/martin/nzbget/nzbget -Q\nend script \n\nProgram starts fine.

I know that a lot of questions have been posted regarding the installation of OpenCV, but right now I need to install both OpenCV 2.4 along with OpenCV 3.0.0\nSince there are a lot of research codes available online and the authors of these say that our code is not compatible with OpenCV 3.0.0, I am wondering how can I install both versions of OpenCV.\nEven before the installation instructions, can somebody please tell me how to remove all the existing versions of OpenCV from my PC. I want to do a clean installation of OpenCV, with appropriate setting of all the environment variables.\nThanks in Advance.\n\nA: Run command: sudo apt-get remove opencv.\nThis will uninstall the opencv and then delete the opencv folder from home, that's it.\n\nA: Only gives you one at a time;\nYou can compile both versions, and keep the compiled code in the build folders. When you want to use a specific version, run sudo make -j 4 install in that build folder.\n\nA: To uninstall OpenCV, you have 2 options depending on how you installed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you installed it with apt-get, run: sudo apt-get remove opencv.\n\n*If you compiled it by your own, I think it was something like (sudo) make uninstall in the directory where you did make and make install (usually build/).\n\n\nBoth will uninstall OpenCV (in the later case it will still leave you the local folder you used to compile it, so you can re-compile or re-install it at any moment).\nTo install both OpenCV versions. I dumb trick I did was to prepare 2 OpenCV compilation folders (one for each version). And then a bash script program that performs make uninstall on one folder and make install on the other one. It should take it ~15 seconds to switch the OpenCV version on this way, since both version will be already locally compiled.\n", "Q: How to recover folder from previous ubuntu version I had Ubuntu 13.04 version in my computer.

How to get my dhcp ip address, whether i am in a local network?\nI.e. if we have internet access in local network, but i want to know my dhcp server IP .. like \" what is my IP\" .. \n\nA: Edit\nYour question was worded in slightly confusing way. Getting your public IP form terminal can be done with curl https://diagnostic.opendns.com/myip. Open DNS has web service that tells you your IP address, which is pretty much just a web page , with only one text - your IP. Effectively, you are downloading a web page that tells you your IP. \nOriginal\nTypically dhcp server is located on the router. Thus , your main goal then is to get address of the router, which in networking terms would be default gateway. Thus , effectively your question can be solved by the multiple solutions as described in my answer here. The simplest method is to use netstat -nr command.\nThere is another method as well: nmcli dev list | grep -i dhcp_server_identifier (Ubuntu 14.04 and earlier).  Sample output for that would be:\n$ nmcli dev list | grep -i dhcp_server_identifier                              \nDHCP4.OPTION[13]:                       dhcp_server_identifier = 192.168.0.1\n\nWith Ubuntu 15.04 the nmcli version is different, hence you have to enter slightly different command:\nnmcli dev show | \\grep 'gw ='\n\nSide note : grep in my install of 15.04 is aliased to grep --color=auto which prints colorized output. If we want just to see the particular lines, we need to use simple grep, which the forward slash instructs the shell to use.\n\nA: What is my ip shows you the public IP of your gateway.

I have read of a lot of questions about SSD optimization (How do I optimize the OS for SSDs?, Installing Ubuntu on a SSD, I'm confused about SSD optimization, etc...).\nMost of those questions seem outdated (3+ years old) and I am a little bit confused with all the directions the answers are taking.\nSo my question is : As of today, what is the general consensus about SSD optimization on Ubuntu 14.04 / 15.04 ?\nIs this even needed now ?\n\nA: The only thing you may need to do is to add --no-model-check to /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim.\nThe line should look this way\nexec fstrim-all --no-model-check   \n\nCheck that your SSD supports TRIM (almost all recent models do) by\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep \"TRIM supported\"\n\nif your SSD is /dev/sda. If it does, add --no-model-check.\n\nA: It works fine with SSD which supports TRIM\nfor 16.04 there is no \nfstrim-all\n\nsimple fstrim does not have \n--no-model-check\nand it works fine with sandisk ssd\n\nA: The thing is , first most important part about SSDs is minimizing the writes to the disk, which is why people add nodiratime, noatime to the /etc/fstab file. \nSecond , is running TRIM which reclaims unused blocks of NAND memory back to SSD. Windows has TRIM enabled by default, AFAIK, so no one bothers there. With Ubuntu, it does have a weekly cronjob  for TRIM, however for I've learned from Rinzwind's answer that the cron job only runs on Intel and Samsung SSDs. That's why you have to edit that /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim file to have exec fstrim-all --no-model-check line, so that it runs no matter what is your SSD model.\nOver the recent years, this has not changed - these are still key points , minimizing writes and enabling TRIM.\nRemoving writes and expensive storage amount is the two factors why people also remove swap area. By default, Ubuntu creates swap partition equal to your RAM size. I have a 128 SSD and 6 GB of RAM. That means that by default Ubuntu will chop off 6 GB from 128GB, leaving 122GB for my OS, and 5% is typically reserved for root, so that leaves me 122-122*0.05=115.9 GB for myself. I might as well use that storage for something else, which is why I have only one main partition, no swap partition, but I do have a 512 MB swap file  as a protective feature (not that I plan on running out of RAM, but it's always recommended to have swap)\n\nA: Generally Ubuntu supports Solid State Drives very well.\nIf you have an intel or a SAMSUNG SSD, automatic trim support is enabled by default.   \nYou don't have to care about much with one exception:\nYou should store your personal data on a HDD to reduce the amount of writes to SSD.\n", "Q: bash: /path/.bash_aliases: Permission denied I don't know why this line appears first when I open my gnome-terminal.\nbash: /home/username/.bash_aliases: Permission denied\nlaptop-dell:-$\n\nI tried this but still the problem remains there.\nchmod +x ~/.base_aliases\nchmod: cannot access `/home/username/.base_aliases': No such file or directory\n\nWhat should be the default permission of 'bash_aliases' ?\nHow to fix this ?\n\nA: Using the right command and file names ;), in your second command is a typo: ~/.bash_aliases and not ~/.base_aliases\nsudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.bash_aliases\n\nand so I can sleep peacefully (thank you @ByteCommander)\nchmod 644 ~/.bash_aliases\n\n\nAnd maybe it's time to correct the permissions for the whole folder:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME\n\n\nA: I do a similar thing in my .bashrc file.

This becomes complicated when there are other positional/getopts parameters. In these cases, I've had to first determine and then remove the parameters not associated with the array using some combination of shift and array element removal. \nA purist perspective likely views this approach as a violation of the language, but pragmatically speaking, this approach has saved me a whole lot of grief. On a related topic, I also use eval to assign an internally constructed array to a variable named according to a parameter target_varname I pass to the function:\neval $target_varname=$\"(${array_inside[@]})\"\n\n\nA: There are couple of problems. Here is the working form :\n#!/bin/bash\nfunction copyFiles {\n   arr=( \"$@\" )\n   for i in \"${arr[@]}\";\n      do\n          echo \"$i\"\n      done\n\n}\n\narray=(\"one\" \"two\" \"three\")\ncopyFiles \"${array[@]}\"\n\n\n*\n\n*There need to be at least a space between function declaration and {\n\n\n*You can not use $array, as array is an array not a variable. If you want to get all the values of an array use \"${array[@]}\"\n\n\n*In you main function declaration you need arr=\"$@\" as \"${array[@]}\" will expand to the indexed values separated by spaces, if you use $1 you would get only the first value. To get all the values use arr=\"${arr[@]}\".\n\nA: If you want to pass one or more arguments AND an array, I propose this change to the script of @A.B.\nArray should be the last argument and only one array can be passed\n#!/bin/bash\nfunction copyFiles() {\n   local msg=\"$1\"   # Save first argument in a variable\n   shift            # Shift all arguments to the left (original $1 gets lost)\n   local arr=(\"$@\") # Rebuild the array with rest of arguments\n   for i in \"${arr[@]}\";\n      do\n          echo \"$msg $i\"\n      done\n}\n\narray=(\"one\" \"two\" \"three\")\n\ncopyFiles \"Copying\" \"${array[@]}\"\n\nOutput:\n$ ./foo   \nCopying one\nCopying two\nCopying three\n\n\nA: The best way is to pass as position arguments. Nothing else. You may pass as string, but this way may cause some troubles. Example:\narray=(one two three four five)\n\nfunction show_passed_array(){\n  echo $@\n}\n\nor     \nfunction show_passed_array(){\n  while $# -gt 0;do\n    echo $1;shift\n  done\n}\n\n    show_passed_array ${array[@]}\n\noutput:\n  one two three four five\n\nYou mean if array value has space symbols you must quote elements first before pass for accessing value by index in function use  $1 $2 $3 ... position parameters. Where index 0 -> 1, 1 -> 2,... To iterate access it is best to use always $1 and after Shift. Nothing additional is needed. You may pass arguments without any array like this:\nshow_passed_array one two three four five\n\nbash media automatically builds an array from passed arguments that passed them to function and then you have position arguments.\nFurthermore when you write ${array[2]} you really write consequent argument one two three four and passed them to the function.\nSo those calls are equivalent.   \n\nA: I propose to avoid any limitation about \"passing array(s) args\" to a function by... passing strings, and make them array INSIDE the function : \n#!/bin/bash\n\nfalse_array1='1 2 3 4 5'\nfalse_array2='my super fake array to deceive my function'\nmy_normal_string='John'\n\nfunction i_love_arrays(){\n  local myNumbers=(\"$1\")\n  local mySentence=(\"$2\")\n  local myName=\"$3\"\n  echo \"My favorite numbers are, for sure: \"\n  for number in ${myNumbers[@]}\n  do\n    echo $number\n  done\n  echo \"Let's make an ugly split of a sentence: \"\n  for word in ${mySentence[@]}\n  do\n    echo $word\n  done\n  echo \"Yeah, I know, glad to meet you too. I'm ${myName}.\"\n}\n\ni_love_arrays \"${false_array1}\" \"${false_array2}\" \"${my_normal_string}\"\n\n\nA: Using references (easiest way; best and only way for passing associative arrays):\nprint()\n{\n    [ \"$1\" = \"arr\" ] || { declare -n arr; arr=\"$1\"; }\n    # The name of reference mustn't match the input coming to the function.\n    # If it does, use the name directly as array instead of reference.\n    \n    echo \"${arr[@]}\"\n}\n\nprint arr\n\nFor normal (non-associative) arrays:\nHere is a function that copies the passed array in new (local) array for usage. Can be time-taking for long arrays.\ncopy_fn()\n{\n    eval local newarr=\\(\\${$1[@]}\\)\n    echo ${newarr[@]}\n}\n\nFurther, like in C++ you can only pass an array pointer, but in python, as a shared variable which you can modify as well.\nHere is the shared variables approach.. useful for long arrays.\nmodify_arr()\n{\n    eval local ptr=$1        # works as if ptr is a pointer to actual \"array-name\" (arr)  # the original array is, thus, still same, not a copy\n    eval $ptr+=(1)           # modify the array\n    echo ${ptr[@]}           # will print name of the array (arr)\n    eval echo \\$\\{$ptr[@]\\}  # will print the actual array (arr)\n}\n\nmodify_arr a\necho ${a[@]}\n\n-Himanshu\n\nA: @SBF\nYour idea sparked some thinking on a situation I needed where two arrays were to be compared.\nYou can pass multiple arrays using your technique with a minor modification.

Does dd act at the filesystem level or go to the raw device directly?\n\nA: dd works on whatever you chose it to work on.\nYou can take the terminal streams (stdin and stdout), or anything represented by a file descriptor as in- and output of dd.\nAnd as almost everything on Linux has a file descriptor, you can use files, directories, character devices (e.g. /dev/null, /dev/random), block devices (e.g. partitions/file systems like /dev/sda1 or directly entire disks like /dev/sda).\nAs you can see, dd is a pretty powerful and versatile tool, but make sure you use it with caution as it's also known as \"disk destroyer\" if you accidentally use it with unintended arguments.\nIf you're interested in more information about dd, read its manpage (run man dd) or look for example at Answer to \"dd vs cat — is dd still relevant these days?\" (Unix&Linux.SE) or What does the command name \"dd\" stand for?\n", "Q: Which files are the faulty ones when checking defects I am trying to install ubuntu from USB stick.

My md5sum does match and this is the fourth USB stick I am trying\n\nA: If the md5checksum checks out I would assume it is safe to continue. It could be the USB that could be faulty.\nPossible method to confirm: re-download the ISO and burn it again to this and another USB or even use another machine and burn it there to this and another USB.

Thanks.\n\nA: By default in Ubuntu the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file of the openssh-server has the following line:\nPermitRootLogin without-password\n\nthis prevents to login into the ssh-server as root using password which is for security reasons, you can use key based authentication (and any other not using password) mechanism to login as root directly.\nSo you have two options:\n\n*\n\n*First the bad option, avoid this one. Make the line of /etc/ssh/sshd_config as:\n  PermitRootLogin password\n\n\n\n*The good option is to login as another user who has access to the server, then switch to the root account by:\n  su - root  ## Will need root's password.\n\nor\n    sudo su -  ## Will need calling user's password.

This solution aslo will work. \nSolution 3\nSimple connect printer to switch port on router and configure printer on the same network like PC but without gw. PC will communicate with printer through router. \n\nA: Assuming you want only your pc to have access to the printer,\nand that you can configure the printer to have a fixed IP address 172.16.x.y this can work. \nOtherwise you may need to setup a dhcp server for eth1 for the printer. dnsmasq is an easy choice.

I also cannot find any sound outputs in my Sound Settings which is a pain!\nI've tried purging/removing/reinstalling pulse audio and force-reloading alsa and absolutely anything else I can find in these threads, but nothing seems to be working.\nI logged into my Guest Session and sound was working perfectly there, though.

What is the good way to set the system to use the new version.  For example, it is installed into /usr/lib/llvm-3.6 directory, but if I am in home directory, and type in clang, it tells me that clang is not installed.  So to solve the problem I add the clang bin directory to the path in .bashrc, like so export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/llvm-3.6/bin/:/usr/lib/llvm-3.6/lib.  That seems to work but it is a bit of a pain, because I use fish and bash, and now I have to add path to both.  Is there a better way to configure the system to use the desired llvm banaries?  I searched update-alternatives but I am not sure I understand how to use it correctly.\nThanks.\n\nA: You could probably create a symbolic link (symlink) in a directory that is already a part of both shells' PATH like /usr/local/bin, name it clang and link it to the actual binary in /usr/lib/llvm-3.6/bin or wherever it is:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-3.6/bin/clang /usr/local/bin/\n\nThat way, the shell finds the link if you type cname, resolves it to the real file and runs that one. It links to the name of the file, so as long as the file name and location of the binary does not get changed, it's fine. You may even replace it with an updated version as long as it is not named differently.\nThe only alternative is to change your PATH variable.\n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu Snappy started using KVM?

This selects the processes whose\n          executable name is given in cmdlist.\n\nExample:\n$ ps u -C vlc\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nsylvain  12586  0.1  0.3 1076848 60908 ?       Sl   20:10   0:00 /usr/bin/vlc\n\n\nA: Use bash process substitution and cat :\ncat <(ps aux | head -1) <(ps aux | grep '[v]lc')\n\nThe process substitution pattern <() replaces the output of the command inside it as a file. cat will simple concatenate the files as usual.\nExample :\n$ cat <(ps aux | head -1) <(ps aux | grep '[v]lc')\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nchayan   26031  2.3  0.4 1098532 38556 pts/31  Sl   20:45   0:00 vlc\n\n\nA: I would use \nps aux | grep -E '^USER|vlc'\n\nyou can add | grep -v grep to exclude the grep line\n\nA: Just tell ps to only show the output for vlc:\n$ ps -P $(pgrep vlc)\nPID PSR TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND\n6728   2 pts/0    Sl     0:00 vlc\n\npgrep lists the PIDs of any processes whose name matches the pattern given. ps's -P switch lets you list info only for specific PIDs. Combining the two gives you the ps header and only the lines you care about. \n\nA: So you're trying to preserve the head of the PS command (so you can see the headers) but only show vlc commands.\nI'd personally just use awk and filter based on two conditions, the line number and the VLC. If either are true, we output the line:\n$ ps aux | awk 'NR==1 || $11~/vlc/'\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\noli       4833  0.6  0.2 795220 62952 ?        Sl   15:37   0:00 /usr/bin/vlc\n\nIt has the added advantage that you're only running ps once. And because field 11 is the main command (not any of its arguments), we won't capture the awk command being run either. We just get VLC and the column headers.\n\nOn a sidebar, something like this should work... but doesn't...\nps aux | tee >(head -1 >&2) | grep vlc\n\nYou were close, you needed to pipe into the last command or tee will sploodge over STDOUT, and if you output to STDOUT and then pipe, chances are it'll be caught up in the latter grep. In the above I output the headers into STDERR (2) to stop grep interfering with it. Bit hacky but hey-ho.\nBut yes, this still doesn't work. The reason is that head closes STDOUT, which filters back to tee and arrests the grep. This is by design so head doesn't process more input than it needs to. You can simulate what it's doing with awk:\n$ ps aux | tee >(awk 'NR==1 {print;exit}' >&2) | grep \"grep\"\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\n\nThis is equivalent to head -1. It finds the first line and then exits. This kills off the input buffer, and tee flips out.\nHere's a version where awk doesn't quit after it finds the first line. It'll keep running (good thing or not) over every line:\n$ ps aux | tee >(awk 'NR==1' >&2) | grep \"grep\"\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\noli      15103  0.0  0.0  11752  2236 pts/18   S+   11:32   0:00 grep --color=auto grep\n\nAnother alternative is sending the input into sponge. Sponge soaks up the whole input stream before writing it to a file (or being redirected). This stops head killing off the parent stream but it does mean the input will be reversed (the grep will output first) so we'll push that through a sponge instance too:\n$ ps aux | tee >(sponge >(head -1 >&2)) | sponge >(grep \"grep\")\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\noli      14875  0.0  0.0  11752  2192 pts/18   S    11:19   0:00 grep --color=auto grep\n\nBut while these second two both work, and you're only generating ps aux output once, they still both have serious issues. The awk|grep is processing everything twice and the sponge orgy is buffering everything twice.\ntl;dr: If you can process it all in one command like you can with awk, why wouldn't you?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - what version of padre should I use?

I do have my system on a 5 disk raid5 mdadm array.  My problem is that Google hangouts crashes when I do video streaming (sometimes). \nI recently installed Ubuntu server 14.04 with standard Ubuntu desktop.  I used to have Kubuntu 14.04.  I have since wiped the server version of Ubuntu and reinstalled the desktop version but the problem remains.\nWhen I had Kubuntu my webcam (and google hangouts) worked fine without any special driver tweaking (unfortunately I don't remember which Nvidia driver I was using).  Now I have Ubuntu 14.04 and when I try to use Google hangouts with my webcam or screen sharing it crashes after a few minutes.  (Just the window crashes, not the whole computer).  If I keep the webcam turned off and only use the embedded mic it seems to work fine.  Also if I use low quality video it doesn't crash.  However, even if it is in low quality, doing a screen share will cause it to crash.\nThe crashes occur in both Chrome and Firefox.  I haven't tried other browsers. \nHere's my lsusb -v for the webcam http://pastebin.com/LL6S3wUD although I think the webcam is a red herring at this point, I'll leave this here in case someone wants to look at it.\nI have Nvidia Geforce GTX 650 Ti with Nvidia 340.76 driver and then 352.3 and then the 346.82 driver.  I was using the 340.76 and then the 352.3 drivers while on the server build and on the desktop build I went straight to 346.82 from the GUI because it's the one that said it was tested.\nHere's how the (hangouts) crashes unfold:\nThe first thing that happens is I'll stop getting audio and video of the people I'm chatting with.  When I look at my system monitor, one of the CPU cores will go to 100% and the network activity drops to 0.  The Xorg process is what seems to be using up the CPU during this time.  Xorg won't consistently show a high CPU utilization but the CPU core itself will stay at 100% for a minute or two.   After I click through the crash window the processors return to normal usage.\nIt seems like there's something going on with the window manager but I don't really know what else to try or look at.  I started looking at various logs and I came across a couple things, I don't know if they're related.

There seems to be a known issue with Nvidia drivers and UEFI boots.  Fortunately I didn't have to change anything with my installation/system and was able to resolve my problem by updating the firmware on my motherboard.\nTo give some more detail:\nI initially installed the Server version to get a friendlier mdadm installation experience after wanting to put my drives in a raid.  With the server version, my problem arose and I didn't think about the MBR to GPT switch.  The first idea was that there might be a package missing in the server version so I went with the desktop version of Ubuntu.  I still had the same problem and it seemed my Nvidia drivers weren't loaded properly so I reinstalled the OS yet again.  This time I decided to go back to Kubuntu (both because it had worked once, and I didn't really like Unity anyways) but after a fresh install of kubuntu I was having the same problem.  After a lot of googling I stumbled upon an issue with Nvidia drivers and UEFI boots and that's when it hit me that I was legacy mode before.  I cringed at the idea of having to convert my GPT to MBR with my RAID setup so I, on a whim, decided to update my motherboard's firmware.  I didn't have high hopes it would work but in the end that's what fixed my problem.\n", "Q: JAVA Graphics does not display! I made a post earlier that was not clear! Here is the code.

It is ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel. If you open a file with Gimp (or any other app that supports the recently-used file), the file name will be added to recently-used.xbel. You may have a backup copy of that somewhere. Otherwise, you could recreate it by editing the current file recently-used.xbel and adding an entry for each Gimp file you want to have available. Such an entry would look like this:\n  <bookmark href=\"file:///path/to/file\" added=\"2015-09-05T10:28:53Z\" modified=\"2015-09-05T10:36:40Z\" visited=\"2015-09-05T10:28:54Z\">\n    <info>\n      <metadata owner=\"http://freedesktop.org\">\n        <mime:mime-type type=\"image/gif\"/>\n        <bookmark:groups>\n          <bookmark:group>Graphics</bookmark:group>\n        </bookmark:groups>\n        <bookmark:applications>\n          <bookmark:application name=\"GNU Image Manipulation Program\" exec=\"&apos;gimp-2.8 %u&apos;\" modified=\"2015-09-05T10:36:40Z\" count=\"4\"/>\n        </bookmark:applications>\n      </metadata>\n    </info>\n  </bookmark>\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 not booting on main user after name change So I wanted to change the name of the home folder, and did so using the mv command: \nmv /home/oldname /home/newname. It worked fine. No errors appeared until I tried accessing the home folder. It said it couldn't find /home/oldname (I don't remember the full error).\nI though I could fix it easily by editing the passwd file. I searched for passwd within the /etc directory and found a few results. I just double clicked the first result (I know it's stupid) and then the file explorer exited. I couldn't click on anything and nothing was working, so I rebooted the computer. When I came to the login screen, I entered my password and pressed enter. The screen went black for a while, and then returned to the login screen. Basically I can't login my main account, I can only use Guest, which deletes any changes to Ubuntu on exit. If anyone knows how I can edit the passwd file from there or fix it in another way, that'd be great. I know this might be a duplicate, but non of the questions I found were using the same command as me which might make a difference. Also please note that I don't want to rein\n\nA: Your initial guess was correct - you need to change the home directory entry in /etc/passwd file. That means you can either use sudo vipw or sudo sed -i 's;/home/oldName;/home/newName;' /etc/passwd in terminal. To access virtual terminal press CtrlAltF2 (or any F key from 1 to 6), and login there.\n", "Q: How to install ‘Nautilus’ on VirtualBox and use it with ssh?

I got both up and running just fine, the system booted without any issues. However, when I came back to start compiling the CUDA samples I was met with the following warnings on some of the package installs:\n\nWARNING: libGLU.so not found\nWARNING: libX11.so not found\n\nI followed the instructions on the getting started with CUDA on linux page and tried to install libGLU.so with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa libxi-dev libxmu-dev\n\nThis didn't work so I then tried to install the mesa implementation using the following:\nsudo apt-get install libglapi-mesa && sudo apt-get install libosmesa6\n\nThis worked, I could now compile all of the CUDA samples. However, I'm thinking that this is where the error is originating from.

It reminds me of some problems other OS face with double-clicking file to install virus.\n\nA: There are a few important sub-questions, here, so I'll attack this piece by piece:\nWhat makes a file \"executable\"?\nLinux and Unix systems determine whether a file is executable by examining the \"execute\" (-x) bit of the file permissions.\nIf you go to a terminal and run ls -l Downloads (replace \"Downloads\" with the location of your downloaded files, if different). You may see something like this:\ntotal 13557K\n-rwxrwxr-x  1 Matthew Matthew  13557241 Apr 11 04:11 Downloaded_Game\n\nThe xs in the first column mean the file is executable by the owner (Matthew), the group (Matthew), and world (everyone). (The r and w correspond to \"readable\" and \"writable\", respectively.)\nOK, what is setting the \"execute\" bit?\nWhenever a file is created on a Linux system, the process (program) that is creating the file (in your case, most likely your web browser) must specify the file permissions. These permissions are then usually but not always limited by the user's umask. See the manual page for umask for more information on this sub-question.\nWhat difference does this make to security?\nYou may have a point in questioning whether there is a potential security risk in marking downloaded files as executable. However, Linux and Unix systems in general are historically noted for getting in the user's way as little as possible.\nThat being said, Linux and Unix systems also inherently limit the damage that executable programs can do, at least when those programs are run by a regular user (and not as the superuser, root). A program that deletes your home directory could likely still ruin your lunch break, but as is the expectation of responsible users of any operating system, you are ultimately the one responsible for ensuring you only run programs that you trust, or can verify yourself.\nIn other words, even with the execute bit on, you still have to make the decision to run the program. More importantly, even without the execute bit, the file can still be executed, so it would be false to consider the lack of an execute bit more \"secure\" in any significant sense.\nConclusion\nIn short, don't worry overmuch about a file's executable status. As emphasized above, be careful what you download in the first place, and verify what you download before you run it. Where possible, use trusted sources like the Ubuntu apt repository.\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK & QT Creator crash on start with error 'Failed to create OpenGL context' I just did a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.04, and followed the instructions for installing the Ubuntu SDK located here: https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/start/ubuntu-sdk/installing-the-sdk/\nOn launching the SDK (or QT Creator), I receive the following error:\nWelcome Mode Error:\n\nFailed to create OpenGL context for format QSurfaceFormat(version 2.0,options QFlags(), depthBufferSize 24, redBufferSize -1, greenBufferSize -1, blueBufferSize -1, alphaBufferSize -1, stencilBufferSize 8, samples -1, swapBehavior 2, swapInterval 1, profile 0).\n\nIn case it was related to me having an NVidia card, I tried switching over to the proprietary NVidia drivers, but am still receiving the error. \nI found a post where somebody suggested that a fix for this in QT Creator is to go into the 'help > about plugins' menu in the application and disable the welcome screen, however both QT creator and the Ubuntu SDK hang before I can get to the option through the GUI. \nSince I can't get that fix to work, and the official documentation just assumes everything works, I'm somewhat at a loss.

(keep it simple ...)\nHow about archiving this file with password (ZIP, 7Z, arj etc...), and allow users to work only with changeable part?\nSee:\n[header.txt]\nA B C\nby Gero\n\n[contents.txt]\nwhatever users want to change or have rights to change\n\nOn printing or on producing final document:\ncat header.txt contents.txt\n\nTo protect your precious \"ABC\", you should compress header.txt into password-locked archive. That's only case when the root user could not change your text without knowing archive's password.\nSuch approach is system and architecture independent: do not put all eggs into same basket store constant and variating data in the file which does not allow different access level to its different parts.\n", "Q: website should only load with its Domain Name not IP My website is being loaded with its IP address as well which is not good for SEO. How can i restrict my apache not to do so and only my domain name request should get the website.\nPlease find e below my configuration,\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n        ServerName mydomain.com\n        ServerAlias www.mydomain.com\n        ServerAdmin admin@mydomain.com\n        DocumentRoot /var/www/html\n        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\"IP Canonicalization\" Be careful, your server IP is not forwarding to your website's domain name. Search engines like Google™ are now able to index your website with its IP instead of its domain name. This will result in duplicate content.\n\nTo check this for your website, enter your IP address in the browser and see if your site loads with the IP address. Ideally, the IP should redirect to your website's URL or to a page from your website hosting provider.\n\nIf it does not redirect, you should do an htaccess 301 redirect to make sure the IP does not get indexed.\n\n\nA: I hate to tell you this, but DNS is just a mask for an IP address. There is no way (to my knowledge) to disable IP connections as it would also block DNS.\n\nA: If you create a \"NameVirtualHost\" in Apache, which is separate from the default virtualhost, then Apache will direct requests for the correct name to one virtualhost, and other requests to the default virtualhost... the default virtualhost can contain an error, or a redirect to the correct name.\nThis works because Apache looks at the \"Host:\" header in the HTTP 1.1 protocol to determine which virtualhost to select.  This also allows multiple sites to share the same name.\nNote however that it does not work for SSL without additional protocol extensions that are not always supported.\n", "Q: Ports not Forwarding to Ubuntu Server I have set up a simple LAMP and OpenSSH server, which is operating normally. That is, from the intranet. Accessing webpages/ssh is impossible from outside of my network.\nI am fairly confident that I have set up my port forwarding properly on my router.

My router is linked to a modem, as most networks probably are. However, my modem doubles as a router. What had happened was all of the ports were being blocked by my \"modem\". I forwarded all of the ports on my modem to my actual router, and things are running just fine now.

I'm not sure what is the best way to move forward while not harming the community, if that makes sense.)\n\nA: Are you by chance on a resedential ISP? They tend to block ports like that. You could call them if so, but I don't know if they'd open the ports. You could also switch the stuff to ports outside of the usual web server, etc range, and it might not block.\n", "Q: Stereo Reverb on LMMS I need this effect called \"Stereo reverb\" in LMMS but I have installed all (related)aldspa plugins which used to provide it when it was \"ladspa-plugin\".

It worked before with Unity, but now it doesn't work any more on LXDE. Anyone has an idea how to make it work on LXDE? Thanks.\n\nA: How thoroughly did you \"replace Unity with LXDE\"? I'm asking because it isn't clear which program you're using to get the screen capture.\nIn a pure LXDE situation --- Lubuntu is the LXDE+Openbox distro supported here as an official flavor --- scrot is the default program to take screenshots.\nman scrot has this:\n-s, --select  \n  Interactively select a window or rectangle with the mouse.\n\nIt's then up to you to set up the appropriate keybinds in your rc.xml file (or whatever it's called) which should be in ~/.config/openbox. And you can read about rc.xml here.\nI have separate keybindings for instant and time-delayed screenshots. I haven't set up binding for interactive selection because I rarely need that and prefer to keep a copy of the full screen for \"legal\" reasons. In any case, setting up a keybind for a specific purpose is simple.\nBut here's one way using Shift+PrintScreen\n<keybind key=\"S-Print\">        # Interactive\n  <action name=\"Execute\"><command>scrot -s -q 100 ~/Pictures/%Y%m%d%H%M%S.png</command></action>\n</keybind>\n\nIn this,  \n\n\n*\n\n*-s enables the interactive mode  \n\n*q 100 produces the best quality image while 75 is the default\n\n*~/Pictures/%Y%m%d%H%M%S.png is the filename using strftime (explained in man strftime). Of course, you can choose another destination folder or filename.  \n\n\nAnd I guess it isn't necessary to point out that Lubuntu is a \"slim\" distro and may not have all the facilities that distros with DEs such as Unity, GNOME, KDE, or MATE offer.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.3 qtbase5 dependencies problem, is this a bug?

It may also happen that the installation of a HWE stack triggers removal of packages that you actually wanted to keep like Qt or Wine.\n  \n\nI suspect that this is exactly what happens in your specific case; but in the opposite direction. (HWE stack gets removed because Qt5 package is installed) They also state:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*In may cases the unfulfilled dependencies can be resolved if the problematic package is de-installed and then the HWE Stack installed again. \n  \n*In many cases it is even possible to install the problematic package again after the HWE stack is installed. \n  \n*In some cases the installation of additional *-lts-*- packages can solve the conflict or prevent the de-installation of required packages\n  \n\nIf this is the case you should perhaps upgrade your system before installing qtbase5-dev.\n\nI am unsure which is the best way forward for you\n\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n*do not install qtbase5-dev and use a Qt4 development environment due to the incompatibility.\n\n\nThis is the safe approach. However, you'll probably not have exactly the Qt environment that you want.\n\n*\n*\n\n*de-install HWE stack \n\n*install qtbase5-dev \n\n*re-install HWE stack\n\n\nThe risk is that you will at some time loose the graphic desktop. You should be confident to do all the steps from the commandline on a virtual terminal. You may run into issues with dependencies.\n\n*\n*\n\n*de-install HWE stack\n\n*upgrade your system to (non-LTS) 15.04 Vivid Vervet\n\n*install latest mesa and kernel(s) from ppa.\n\n\n\nThis is IMHO less risky than option 2.

They came with Windows 8.1 preinstalled. For computer A I swapped out the hard drive with a 250GB solid state drive, and proceed to install Ubuntu 15.04. This was a bit of a pain, but it eventually worked. There was no problem booting the iso memory stick with the 15.04 image on it once I modified the BIOS.\nOn the second compuber B, I upgraded to Windows 10. Once the upgrade was installed I was not able to book the memory stick, regardless of the BIOS settings. So, I called Lenovo support, and after a somewhat intelligent conversation, they told me it was not possible. The only way I could boot the ubuntu memory stick would be to install Windows 8 from a recovery drive. But, I said, I wont be able to boot that because I cant boot from the USB stick. They said \"dont worry it will work, as long as the memory stick/cdrom/DVD boot drive has a supported Windows 8.

The real problem was very subtle, and it boiled down to the synaptics mouse-pad driver. \nThe question of the boot option was not really an issue. I was able to work\naround the boot, by following the right rules. If you send me email, I can walk you through this problem. Its a mater of setting up the correct BIOS options, then you can install linux, no problem.\nThe mousepad synaptics driver was a different story. It is broken, and you must remove it, which is not hard.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1506817\nThat I worked out too, but it took months. Now my X250 it is all working. I still have a hardware issue, but that has nothing to do with linux.\n\nA: The tech support told me that Linux was not supported. That I suspect is true.\nShe led me to believe (and I asked) that Linux would not boot once Windows 10 was installed on the X250. This a germ of truth to it, but I did get it to book, eventually. As I indicated above, there was (and likely still is) a very subtle bug the synaptic mouse driver. This is all explained in the bug report mentioned above:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1506817\nThe solution to this problem is explained in this report. However in the end, you will not find the mouse-pad functional. The three mouse buttons will work, and the red mouse button will work. I didn't like the synaptic touch pad so I don't miss that. If you need it, you will need to work that out on your own. \nIn my view, the synaptic driver is broken.

That system reserved space is that bootloader. As for it running out of space, that shouldn't be happening. Go into Ubuntu and pull up a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), and type sudo update-grub at the prompt. It will ask you for your password. Enter it. Keep in mind that no dots will display, just press enter when you are done and it will execute. After that runs, your Ubuntu bootloader will update and you should only have one entry for Windows.\n", "Q: how to change the cloud archive mirror in juju?

You need to downgrade your BIOS. I too was suffering from this problem and did the following:\nSince 2015-12-28 no need to downgrade any more, just upgrade your bios (download, double click & restart)!

This will ignore the fact that 1.25 -> 1.15 is a downgrade.\nPrepare for a reboot, i.e. close unnecessary applications. Because it'll happen automatically after running the installer.\nRun H2OFFT-W.exe.\nUpon reboot, you'll see a bios installing progress bar.\nAfter that is done, press F2 during startup to get to bios.

The default for Ubuntu without LVM seems to be to install a LUKS volume directly to the disk.\nThe system is actually dual-booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu (should have mentioned this, sorry!). To find out the culprit (hint: It's always Microsoft): we parse the strings in the first sector of the disk:\nsudo dd bs=512 count=1 if=/dev/sdc 2>/dev/null | strings\nWhich shows for the backup disk with the lost LUKS header:\nInvalid partition table\nError loading operating system\nMissing operating system\n\nThe default boot drive has Grub 2 and for the same command returns:\nGRUB \nGeom\nHard Disk\nRead\n Error\n\nThe Windows 10 disk with the Windows 10 boatloader:\nInvalid partition table\nError loading operating system\nMissing operating system\n\nBingo! Now I know that I manually installed the Windows bootloader only to the Windows 10 disk, as I had accidentally overwritten it myself with a Grub bootloader and I know the LUKS volume was still there afterwards. However, I have run several automatic Windows 10 repair utilities, as my Windows 10 install keeps freezing/crashing.

I want to split my screen so blue area is Unity Sidebar, red area is area1 and green area2. Mouse should not be able to move from area1 to area2 (only keyboard shortcut will allow to switch mouse position between areas). Any application assigned to area1 or area2 should treat them as an independent screen (if application is forced to full screen mode it should \"feel\" assigned area and only it).\nE.g. if I launched full screen movie or game in red area, I should be able to see green area unobstructed.\n\n\nA: Possible solution:\nUse a tiling screen manager (such as xmonad or my personal favourite, spectrwm).\nThis allows you to run applications in an area and automatically tile them (like the Windows 'Stack windows horizontally' feature). Because the areas have sections, multiple programs can be run under each area including in full screen mode without obstructing the view of the others.\nAs far as mouse locking goes, I can't find a way to stop the mouse from going between areas, but you can stop the focus from being changed when the mouse moves (such that the area will only \"switch focus\" upon a keyboard shortcut combination). To achieve this, edit the .spectrwm.conf (the config file for spectrwm) in your home directory so that the line:\n\n#focus_mode = default\n\nis changed to\n\nfocus_mode = manual\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't use Unity sidebar (although someone might have a way around this)\n\n\nA: I don't think full screen means what you think it means.\nIf it's absolutely important for you to be able to fullscreen an application in a window and still have a sidebar available on your screen, you probably need to go the way of a windowed virtual machine.  That will do the input grabs too.\nIt's possible to use the Compiz place plugin under Ubuntu Unity to describe specific areas of the screen in which to maximize windows, but that doesn't do the input grabbing you're describing.\n", "Q: Editing /etc/grub.d/40_custom Are there any available methods so that I can edit my /etc/grub.d/40_custom from a LiveCD or such?

Namely, I use Croatian or Serbian (Cyrillic) as well as English. I added the languages in iBus, but I can't switch between them (the keyboard shortcut doesn't work, nor does manually selecting a language). The only way to choose an input (other than the default) is to delete all the inputs besides the one I need and then reboot. Also, whichever input is selected, the icon in Task Bar shows \"US\". \nAny suggestions on how to fix the bug (I even tried re-installing the system completely, same thing happened)?\n\nA: It seems to me that the keyboard alyout chosen at installation doesn't always map to the user's keyboard settings. I use the following steps to change from US to GB layout:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the 'US' icon in the taskbar, and select ‘”Keyboard Layout Handler” Settings’. \n\n*The ‘Keyboard Layout Handler’ window will be displayed, the left hand side of the window will be greyed out. Deselect ‘Keep system layouts’ by clearing the adjacent check box. This will enable input on the left hand side of the window.\n\n*In the ‘Keyboard Layouts’ section, click the ‘+ Add’ button, and select the correct option from the ‘Add Keyboard Layout’ screen. Click ‘OK’. The entry should now appear in the ‘Keyboard Layouts’ section.\n\n*Highlight the ‘US’ entry in the ‘Keyboard Layouts’ section by clicking it once, and click the ‘- Remove’ button. The selected option should be the only remaining entry in the list, and the icon in the bottom panel will now display the initials for this layout setting. Click the ‘Close’ button.\n\n\nI hope they work for the Cyrillic layout.\n\nA: In case when you want to use IBus that helped  me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the 'US' icon in the taskbar, and select ‘”Keyboard Layout Handler” Settings\n\n*Select ‘Keep system layouts’ by setting up the adjacent check box.\n\n*Launch language support and select IBus as input method.\n\n*Log out and log in.\n\n*In the IBus settings window on third tab deselect ‘Keep system layouts’.\n\n", "Q: Acer Aspire V3 does not recognize my EFI partition I just installed Kubuntu on an Acer Aspire V3 netbook with a SSD using GPT and the following partition layout:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 MB unformatted partition with boot_grub flag, \n\n*200 MB FAT32 partition with boot flag, \n\n*2GB swap partition, \n\n*20 GB ext4 partition, \n\n*90 GB ext4 partition.\n\n\nThe netbook fails to detect my EFI partition. When I disable the secure mode I can access a menu for choosing a boot binary. The menu shows my SSD but no EFI partition on it.\nI am only able to boot in legacy mode (using the BIOS partition).\nDoes anyone has the same netbook booting in EFI mode? What is your partition scheme?\n\nA: I finally solved the issue, Kubuntu is able to boot with the default UEFI firmware settings (no legacy mode, secure boot enabled). EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi needs to be selected once in the UEFI (press F2 during boot, set a supervisor password, then got to Select an UEFI file as trusted for executing and pick EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi). The password can be removed afterwards. Here some background information: SHIM (shimx64.efi) is a (Microsoft) signed binary used to call GRUB (grubx64.efi); GRUB then loads the Linux kernel. By the way when I boot in legacy mode Kubuntu is unable to shut down correctly and crashes every time I try to change the mouse settings; this is solved after switching to UEFI mode.\n\nA: I tried for hours to get my Acer laptop to recognise the correct EFI to launch.  The bios didn't have the ability to select a trusted EFI and it while it could successfully boot a windows OS, Linux would failed.  I solved it by copying the Linux EFI into the windows boot folder and renaming shim64x.efi over the windows bootmgr.\nWorked like a charm, looks like Acer has hard coded the EFI that will boot.\n", "Q: Have updates to version 15.04 brought some ATAPI usage with them? I'm apologizing in advance for might be not too clear question's title, I'll try to explain better.\nIn short, I've started to experience some boot problems, which sometimes result only in longer boot time and sometimes completely prevent the system to load. In the latter case I'm able to see these messages on the screen (and many more):\nata3.00: failed command: IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE\nata3.00: cmd a1/00:01:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 tag 0 pio 512 is\n         res 58/00:02:00:00:02/00:00:00:00:00/00 Emask 0x52 (ATA bus error)\nata3.00: status: ( DRDY DRQ )\n\n******** skipped here *******\nINFO: task systemd-udevd:422 blocked for more than 120 seconds.\n      Not tainted 3.19.0-20-generic #30-Ubuntu\n\"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.\n\nThere are already some questions on AskUbuntu about problems like mine:\nBoot failure: failed: command IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE\nCan I prevent an IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command to a specific device at boot?\nInstall of Ubuntu 15.04 hanging at “ACPI PCC probe failed” and then “failed command: Read Fpdma Queued”\nwhat I've understood from these is that either my CD-ROM or some controller on the motherboard does not support ATAPI commands and Ubuntu sends them to the device.\nBut I assembled my computer in 2012 and have not experienced any problems like the current ones. \nSo I wonder whether this usage of ATAPI was introduced recently (may be 2 to 3 month ago), because, as I can remember, these problems started after some large updates a couple of month ago.\nBecause if the answer is \"no\" then something has broken either in my motherboard or CD-ROM.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: The answer is NO, at least, the problem had no relation to the recent updates of Ubuntu 15.04.\nIn one of answers at AskUbuntu for similar problem, which I cannot find now, someone mentioned that the lens of a CD-ROM may need cleaning.\nI removed the cover of my CD-ROM, and though I doubt that the dust was the cause of the problem, because there was no dust inside and lens seemed clear, but for some reason, after I cleaned the lens with a soft napkin and reconnected the device to the desktop, the drive began to work correctly (before this I was unable to write), and these messages have gone.\nI hope, this can be helpful to someone, who might find himself in a problem like mine.\n", "Q: USB wrong size after formatting I have a USB Stick that i previously used as a bootable Ubuntu Stick.\nAfter i formatted it, it had only the half size of it left. (16GB stick previous.. after 8GB)\nSeems like the half is lost.\nGParted didnt worked at all ... it wont even give me the option formatting the stick.\ni tried to figure it out with Testdisk and it recognizes that its 16GB in Total. \nWhen i chose in Testdisk the Type GPT, its using MS Data as format.\nDisk /dev/sdb - 7866 MB / 7502 MiB - CHS 1019 243 62\nCurrent partition structure:\n     Partition                  Start        End    Size in sectors\n\nWarning: number of heads/cylinder mismatches 255 (FAT) != 243 (HD)\nWarning: number of sectors per track mismatches 63 (FAT) != 62 (HD)\n 1 P MS Data                     2048   15364382   15362335 [UUI]\n\nHow can i restore the original Size? I tried formatting on Windows and Ubuntu without any success\n\nA: Sounds like a wrong partition table. In gparted steps would be:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Insert USB-Stick to computer\n  \n*$ sudo gparted\n  \n*Select Device (e.g. sdb) -> Right Click -> Unmount \n  \n*In top bar click Device -> create Partition Table -> msdos\n  \n*You should be able to format to your desired filesystem\n  \n\nIf this doesnt work you can also use the command line version parted described in following howto. This basically does the same without a GUI. \nhttp://trisquel.info/en/wiki/how-format-external-storage-device-using-parted\n\nA: I've had this problem a few times after using a USB drive as FAT, then EXT, then NTFS, etc.  Eventually, after all these format and partition table changes, the computer just can't see half or more of the drive anymore.  I know it's not a counterfeit, because I've previously used it at full size, without a problem.  Repartitioning, reformatting, or repairing the partition table never helped.\nWhat did work for me was installing gparted AND gpart, then running \"Attempt Data Rescue\" in the \"Device\" menu in gParted.  After about 10 min on a 4GB drive, the process finished and reported it found no broken partitions.  However, all of the missing space on the drive reappeared as unused space, and a quick reformat brought the drive partition up to full size.\n", "Q: Cannot install using Software Center - fix does not work The Ubuntu Software Center no longer lets me install software (tried to install pdfsam, and Synaptic, both give the same error):\n\nThere seems to be a programming error in aptdaemon, the software that allows you to install/remove software and to perform other package management related tasks.\nDetails:\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/aptdaemon/worker.py\", line 325, in _process_transaction\n      self._apply_changes(trans)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/aptdaemon/pkcompat.py\", line 3157, in _apply_changes\n      install_range)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/aptdaemon/worker.py\", line 1151, in _apply_changes\n      with self._frozen_status():\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3.4/contextlib.py\", line 59, in enter\n      return next(self.gen)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/aptdaemon/worker.py\", line 1175, in _frozen_status\n      frozen_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix=\"aptdaemon-frozen-status\")\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3.4/tempfile.py\", line 426, in mkdtemp\n      dir = gettempdir()\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3.4/tempfile.py\", line 370, in gettempdir\n      tempdir = _get_default_tempdir()\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3.4/tempfile.py\", line 312, in _get_default_tempdir\n      dirlist)\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No usable temporary directory found in ['/tmp', '/var/tmp', '/usr/tmp', '/']\n\nI found and tried this fix, which is featured in all the threads I could find on this problem: Cannot install any software from the Software Center due to ttf-mscorefonts-installer package error\nThe command  sudo dpkg --configure -a\ndoes not work.

If I use a multi-core processor computer, does the Linux OS run on one core or is it distributed to multiple cores?

I have some auto-generated scripts which invoke /etc/init.d method only. Could you kindly provide me some fix/workaround for this?\n\nA: The last answer is a way to solve the defense4all installation problem about \"Failed to start rsyslog service\".This problem is caused by the bug of rsyslog (maybe, I found on the other webs), you can use service rsyslog instead of /etc/init.d/rsyslog, so you can edit the file in defense4all code files to solve this problem. \nIn  the file: \n../defense4all/dfapp.aggregate/src/install/config_rsyslog.bash\n\nchange the last sentences: \n/etc/init.d/rsyslog stop > /dev/null \n\nto:\nservice rsyslog stop\n\nand:\n/etc/init.d/rsyslog stop > /dev/null   \n\nto:         \nservice rsyslog start\n\nAnd then rebuild the project to create .deb or .rpm files.Hope this may help you.\n\nA: You faced this problem because the rsyslog script in newer Ubuntu is written to be handled by upstart and not the traditional init daemon.\nI saw your fix in the comments above. Another workaround that allows your automation scripts to continue using /etc/init.d/rsyslog start|stop is - \nEdit the file /etc/init.d/rsyslog , comment/delete all instances of following code block -\nif init_is_upstart; then\n    exit 1 (or exit 0)\nfi\n\nNow \n/etc/init.d/rsyslog start|stop\n\nshould work.\nFor more information, see this.\n", "Q: Whoy doesn't openssh-server work in ubuntu14.04 Here is all what I can show.\n\n[skynet]~> apt-get install openssh-server\nReading package lists...

You will see the output until you close the terminal.\nBring the command back into foreground with\nfg\n\n\nExample\nCreate a simple script, e.g.\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n    echo foo\n    sleep 5\ndone\n\nStart the script, the program will output the word foo.

So when you do \nping \"$(grep ....)\"\n\nall the newline separated matches are being passed as a single argument to ping which takes only a single address at a time as argument hence it is failing.\nNote that rather than using the Regex pattern you have used you can simplify the matching of the last word using :\ngrep -o 'dc[^ ]\\+$' /etc/squid3/squid.conf\n\nassuming the word starts with dc.\nFinally as you have multiple addresses to run ping over, you should use a loop :\nfor i in $(grep -o 'dc[^ ]\\+$' /etc/squid3/squid.conf); do ping -c 4 \"$i\"; done\n\nping -c 4 will send 4 ICMP Echo_Request packets to each destination.\n\nA: You could also use awk\nawk -F'-h ' '/-h +dc0[12]/ {system(\"ping -c 3 \"$2)}'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-F'-h '\nWe are interested in only what is behind -h.\n\n*/-h +dc0[12]\\.domain\\.local/\nWe are interested in only the string dc01.domain.local and dc02.domain.local\n", "Q: sudo: /usr/sbin/mkfs.ext4: command not found Im trying to use this command on the Ubuntu flavor to create a volume\nsudo: /usr/sbin/mkfs.ext4: command not found\n\nbut get an error.

I have seen several debates on different forums but could not reach to a solution.\nMy notebook has a UHD display running windows 8 as host OS. I have tried Vmware and virtualbox as VMs to have the experience of Ubuntu 14.04 as guest OS. The problem is with the screen resolution I get in the VM, either on a full screen or in any other view size. It's nano and awful. \nMy question specifically is: Is there any VM which supports Ubuntu 14.04 in such a way that we can control the resolution with the best results for user on any notebook with a UHD display?\nOR\nIf any plausible solution exists, even for the mentioned VMs, which I am missing?\n\nA: VirtualBox or VMware does not care what resolution the guest or the host is running. Both use what they find. To view correctly in the guest system, the installed guest operating system is solely responsible and in your case 14.04. \nBut as I already wrote here:\n\nThe 4K technology is relatively new. On the other hand your system is\n  relatively old. If you want to improve the situation, then you must\n  use newer software versions. A first step is to update your system to\n  Vivid or to Wily in some days. And then the application developers are\n  required. The individual applications have to be adjusted.\n\nTherefore install Vivid or Wily and have patience and in any case, install the guest addons, e.g. VMware Tools and/or Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack.\n\nA: If you run a VM on Windows, then run a host within the VM, the display drivers presented to the host, are those of virtual hardware created by the VM.  Your host, will have no idea you're running a UHD display, unless you could pass the whole device to the host (which could only be done, if the actual running OS, windows, was using a different display device).  \nI believe if you use VMWare, and have VMware tools installed in the host, you can resize the VM screen, like a regular desktop window.  Without tools, you have to specify the display resolution in the vm config file.  Looking at an Ubuntu VM I have running under Workstation 10, I can emulate up 10 monitors, each with up to a 2560x1600 resolution.  I'm not sure how to have those multiple monitors display on my physical host, but it must be possible.\nBut remember when you run under a VM, you're not running on your actual machine, the host is running on a virtual host, which you can design as you wish, with whatever hardware you want.  If you want to emulate a UHD display, in the host, you'll need a VM that can emulate one (I was unable to find one given a cursory search in google).  \nIf you're just trying to run Ubuntu in full resolution, did you try running rebooting the system to use Ubuntu on a Live CD.  It will then use whatever drivers it has installed to use your UHD display, as much as it's able.  With the Kubuntu live CD, I've installed Nvidia drivers and tested out a full x display, to be sure the hardware could support running my desktop, before re-installing.  Live CD stores modifications to the virtual hard disk in memory, so you have the perception of a normal running machine, without actually touching the existing HD.  \n\nA: I ran into a simular issue with my Surface Pro.  The solution that I use is simply changing the settings in ubuntu to set the dpi.  You can simply go to all settings > displays > scale for menu and title bars and mess with this value until you find something that is easy for you to read.  If you core issue is with graphics performance this will not help and you will also need to install the tools like others have answered.\n", "Q: HP Pavilion 15-P055 J1R84EA BeatsAudio I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on the laptop in the title.

tarball from: Here (or you can use *.zip)\n\n*extract it somewhere\n\n*run red5.sh ( for windows run red5.bat)\n\n\nNote : it need java so install java before starting red5.sh and after running red5.sh you have to open browser with yourip:5080 you will see red5 page . also don't terminate red5.sh command it will run continuously run on terminal if you terminate then you will not able to see Red5 web page then you have to run again red5.sh script. if you don't want to do this every time then you can create upstart script . all above step tested on ubuntu 14.04 .\nFor upstart script you can see my another answer How to Add Red5 Background Startup on Ubuntu 14.04?\n", "Q: Failed to SFTP connection I want to configure user ftpuser to sftp for an existing apache owned directory

I'm looking for a tool that can give me a visual representation of my ext4 fragmentation. Something similar to how Defraggler, Puran Defrag, and many others (UltraDefrag being the best) display your disk... (most good UIs display the files in the block you're hovering your mouse over)\nIs there anything related for Linux?\nI want to watch my disk and see just how \"unneeded\" defragmentation really is.\nI don't want to use e4defrag, because I'm not sure it can show me what exactly it's doing to my disk.\nEDIT (2021): it would seem a similar, less popular, question has been asked 3 years before this question with suggested tools:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/30743/is-there-a-tool-to-visualize-a-filesystem-allocation-map-on-linux\n\nA: Let's keep it simple...\n1) If you use EXT4, there is no need to defrag unless your disk is ~90% full and under heavy IO (Delete, Read, Write).\n2) If you find yourself with a ~90% full disk that is heavily fragmented, then your problem is (IMHO) insufficient disk space and not fragmentation.  Get a larger disk!\n3) If you can't get a larger disk for any valid reason, then simply copy the whole lot (or by large chunks) to another disk, then copy it back.  The advanced EXT4 FS writes it back contiguously eliminating fragmentation.  This can be scheduled as a cron.daily job using Gnome Scheduler for the converts coming from Windows.\nBEST FIX if you have the problem from point 2 above, get a larger disk!\n\nA: The question is not if there is fragmentation. All file systems have some fragmentation.\nThe question is if the fragmentation is enough to affect performance.\nOn Linux file systems, fragmentation is typically less then 5%, often 1 or 2% unless the disk is 99% full. In the event of a full disk, you can see significant fragmentation, but in that case the problem is a full disk.\n$ sudo fsck.ext2 -fn /dev/sda1\ne2fsck 1.42 (29-Nov-2011)\nPass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes\nPass 2: Checking directory structure\nPass 3: Checking directory connectivity\nPass 4: Checking reference counts\nPass 5: Checking group summary information\nUbuntu_Rescue: 291595/1222992 files (**0.2% non-contiguous**), 1927790/4882432 blocks\n\nSo yes, there is 0.2 % fragmentation, but this is well below the 85% threshold to affect performance.\nSee the blog post Why doesn't Linux need defragmenting?.\nOn Windows, it is not uncommon to see 50% or higher rates of fragmentation (I have seen 200% plus). Thus windows needs defragmentation tools.\nOn Windows they advise defragmentation at thresholds of about 85%.\nSee:\n\n*\n\n*Defragging: Why, How, and Whether\n\n*The Biggest Disk Defragmentation Myths\nSo, bottom line, defragmentation is not a large enough problem on Linux to affect performance, so there are no significant defragmentation tools and you are sort of wasting your time worrying about it.\n\nA: There is no need for defragmentation on Linux systems.\nSo that is why there are not many defrag tools available.\n\nA: People seem to forget that a good modern defragger is not just defrager, but optimiser as well. Different areas of the hard disk platter read at different speeds. The closer to the centre of the disk, the slower the file read is. A modern defragger will analyse file usage and place frequently read files towards the outer edge of the platter and less frequently used files are moved towards the centre. Some even allow files that are flagged as archives to be pull as close to the centre as possible. I have seen large files on my Linux system broken into 1000's of segments.\nI run defrags on my server every month. My temp storage drive where I download my torrents is really bad.\n$ xfs_db -r /dev/md6 -c frag\nactual 462546, ideal 636, fragmentation factor 99.86%\nNote, this number is largely meaningless.\nFiles on this filesystem average 727.27 extents per file\nPeople that claim linux file systems don't need defragging are just regurgitating what someone else said and have never actually checked.\n\nA: Fragview does what I needed and more.\n\nAs you can see if I click on an area of the map it shows which files are in that area, and how fragmented they are.\nI can now use btrfs filesystem defrag should I wish to do so.\nRunning on Ubuntu 18.04 amd64 with a BTRFS filesystem.\n\nA: Currently there are no GUI utilities that offer ease of use\nIf you use NTFS, ExFAT, or other filesystems without any auto-defrag solution on Linux, you are stuck with cumbersome non-intuitive CLI tools.\n\nThe current solution is to use EXT4 or ZFS, which automatically does the brunt work for you to keep your HDDs fast.\nJust avoid using more than 90% of your drive\nif you use an SSD, fragmentation doesn't matter too much unless a file somehow gets so fragmented, the redirections start degrading performance.\nEXT4 can discern an HDD from an SSD and won't kill your write cycles with auto-defragmentation.\njust make sure you don't use swap on an SSD ;)\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu c++ runtimes libraries I need c++ runtimes libraries for ubuntu 12.04 but I don't know the package name.\nCan someone help me\nManu thanks\n\nA: You can do:\nsudo apt-get install libstdc++6:i386\n\nin a terminal.\n", "Q: Long running kiosk application eats up memory without freeing it I've a long running application built with PHP/HTML/CSS3/JS running on Chrome on a Ubuntu Server 14.04.03. I've set everything up to make it work and let it run for some days.\nI've noticed something very disturbing, when I first launch the kiosk the memory usage is around 400MB but as the application runs longer the memory usage increases. It's currently running for about 22 hours and the memory usage is at 1400MB(!). The computer that runs it has 4GB of RAM so it seems like everything is fine for now. When it will reach the 4000MB mark, it will start swapping and my application is basically dead.\nThe Kiosk is running on Chrome version 45. How can I clean up the memory usage and free all available memory?\n\nA: The memory is not \"available\", it has been allocated for use by a program. These programs are called \"memory hogs\". Use commands like top and ps -eF (and, of course man top;man ps) to see which program has the most memory allocated. Then, fix that program.\n", "Q: How do I add a public key for a private debian repo when using juju to deploy a service? I am trying to deploy a service (let's say keystone) using juju-deployer and have set the \"openstack-origin\" to the private debian repo that we have set up. I have set the openstack-origin like this:\n\"openstack-origin\": \"deb http://local-mirror.company.com/ubuntu-cloud trusty-updates/juno main\"\n\nWhen I deploy the service it successfully adds the debian repo to the source list by adding a new file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/juju_deb.list\nand the content is the same as what I set openstack-origin to:\ndeb http://local-mirror.company.com/ubuntu-cloud trusty-updates/juno mainu\nSo far so good. The issue is that when the system goes to install packages from that repo we see the following error:\nWARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!\n  python-dogpile.core python-netaddr python-six python-stevedore\n  python-oslo.config python-pbr python-keystoneclient\n  python-keystonemiddleware python-ldappool python-sqlalchemy python-migrate\n  python-alembic alembic python-oslo.i18n python-oslo.utils python-oslo.db\n  python-oslo.serialization python-posix-ipc python-eventlet python-amqp\n  python-oslo.messaging python-pycadf python-dogpile.cache\n  python-sqlalchemy-ext python-keystone keystone\nE: There are problems and -y was used without --force-yes\n\nIf I manually get on that system that juju is attempting to install the service on then I can reproduce the issue by performing an sudo apt-get -y install keystone and I can also see that I get the following error if I try sudo apt-get update:\nW: GPG error: http://local-mirror.company.com trusty-updates/juno Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 5EDB1B62EC4926EA\n\nSo... my question is how do I make juju add the appropriate public key to this system when it adds the debian repo to the source list so that when it tries to install the package we don't get a hook error? To be clear I am not asking how to add the key manually using apt-key - I need to be able to add the key from juju-deployer when the new service is deployed.\n\nA: For the OpenStack charms a key for a deb url source entry can be specified in the openstack-origin config setting separated by a pipe character. When the key is included as part of the openstack-origin setting, the charms will attempt to import the key from keyserver.ubuntu.com.\ne.g. juju set openstack-origin nova-compute openstack-origin=\"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/billy-olsen/testfix-kilo/ubuntu vivid main|FA0FD8E1\"\nOne thing to note is that the OpenStack charms use the openstack-origin information to determine which OpenStack release is being installed. As such, it is very important to include the codename of the OpenStack release in the the deb mirrors or ppas. Failure to do so will result in errors when deploying the charms.\n\nA: A new bug has been raised.\nTo summarize:\nThe OpenStack charms provide a config option to specify an arbitrary apt repo, but do not provide a mechanism for adding a corresponding public key for scenarios where a custom apt repo is hosted outside of Launchpad.\n", "Q: Can't login to Spark Cluster on EC2 after the nodes started I'm trying to create a cluster of Spark machines.

I have two machines: my laptop and a remote server. The server sits behind a firewall that only allows incoming ssh connections. I can use ssh on my laptop to login to the server without any issues.\nSince I don't want to (can't) change the firewall, I'd still like to be able to run apt-get upgrade and similar commands on the server, and thought that I could easily do the \"reverse\" of ssh -D 1234 user@remote - ie change the -D to something else so that I get a \"reverse socks proxy\" available on the remote end. (This I could later use, after setting up the right environment variables.)\nBoth machines run Ubuntu 15.04 and I'm using OpenSSH.\nWhat command (or commands) should I issue in order to setup a tunnel with SSH, which has a proxy on my end (the laptop with internet access) and the remote server (which only accepts incoming tcp on port 22)?\n\nA: OpenSSH 7.6 introduced reverse dynamic proxy as a native option. It is implemented entirely in the client, so the server does not need to be updated.\nssh -R 1080 server\n\n\nA: I just realized I could solve this with two commands. On the laptop, establish a port with a tunnel back to the laptop:\nssh -R 10002:localhost:22 user_server@server\n\nand on the server open a proxy, using that tunnel:\nssh -D 8080 -p 10002 user_laptop@localhost\n\n", "Q: Symbolic link to NAS I love the \"sticky notes\"- program xpad. Would it be possible to use the command ln -s to link it's config folder to a shared folder on a NAS drive, to have the xpad-sessions synced on all my local computers, and if so, what happens when I'am not connected to the LAN and add a note; will the symbolic link break and never get re-linked?\n\nA: When a program tries to access a symbolic link the kernel silently translates it so the program is actually accessing the target. You could indeed make your ~/.xpadconf (for example; I don't know where its actual config file is) a symbolic link to a config file on a NAS. Example:\nln -s /mnt/NAS/.xpadconf ~/.xpadconf\n\nNote that ln can only link to somewhere on your filesystem, so you would first have to mount the NAS to your local filesystem (e.g. smbfs, sshfs, nfs). Then you can link to it. If xpad stores notes in a different file from config settings you'll have to mount+link that as well (again, I'm not familiar with the program).\nIf the NAS is not mounted, I expect xpad will throw an error because it cannot read the file. If you unmount the NAS while xpad is open then try to save a note, you will either get an error because it cannot write to the file, or xpad will hang due to the broken network mount and you'll have to kill it.\nAs long as you only open xpad and save notes while the NAS is mounted, it should work as you want. I expect you won't have any issues with just viewing notes even if you unmount the NAS with xpad open.\n", "Q: Difference between \"Numix\" and \"Numix Daily\" GNOME themes I have noticed that in the GNOME Tweak Tool there are options to change the themes of various things on your system:\n\nAnd I have also noticed two Numix themes there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Numix\n\n*Numix-Daily\n\n\nNow I have an idea of what Numix is as I use the Numix-Circle theme for icons, however I do not know what the difference between the Numix theme, and the Numix-Daily theme is, so I was wondering if someone could explain as I do not see an obvious visual difference?\n\nA: There is currently no difference.

Using the OSX boot menu, nothing showed up other then my main partition and the recovery partition and when I enabled rEFIt boot the linux option showed up, but when I selected the option, a black screen told me \n\"No Bootabe device found, insert boot disk and press any key\"\n\nWhen I run the partitioning tool on rEFIt, it displays\nCurrent MBR table\n\nERROR: Not found returned from gptsync.efi\n\nHow can I fix this and boot into Ubuntu? I have done a lot of work, and it would be annoying reinstalling every program. \nHere is the output of the Boot Info Script \nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/12509128/\n\nA: One shot-in-the-dark solution is to replace rEFIt, which has been abandoned for over five years, with its maintained fork, rEFInd. (Note: I'm rEFInd's maintainer.) If you want to play it safe, you can try rEFInd risk-free by using its USB flash drive or CD-R version (both available from the downloads page). rEFInd may help because it can detect and launch Linux kernels directly, whereas rEFIt relies on an EFI or BIOS-mode boot loader -- and based on the error message, it sounds like it's trying to launch Linux in BIOS mode but is running into problems with the boot loader.\nThat said, you've got at least one other symptom that disturbs me a bit: the gptsync issue, which might denote a serious partition table problem. OTOH, that could be a gptsync bug or some minor issue that's not worth worrying about. In any event, if you want a more thorough diagnosis, I recommend booting a Linux live session and running the Boot Info Script. (It's available in the boot-info-script package in Ubuntu.) This will generate a file called RESULTS.txt. Post that file to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here. That will give us some solid diagnostic information to help us figure out what's going wrong.\n\nEDIT:\nIt looks like you no longer have a hybrid MBR, which would explain why rEFIt has stopped booting Linux. Your computer seems to have a BIOS-mode GRUB, which would require a hybrid MBR to work correctly. Before you try to fix that, though....\nrEFInd, unlike rEFIt, enables you to boot Linux kernels directly. You should see both the old Linux penguin icon that rEFIt showed you and a new Ubuntu icon. The latter should launch the Linux kernel directly, and it should work without a hybrid MBR. If that works, I recommend you use it and ignore the old BIOS-mode Linux icon. (You can remove it, too, but that will require more effort.)\nIf you don't see an Ubuntu icon, you might need to install an EFI driver for ext4fs. This driver comes with rEFInd, and should have be installed automatically if you used install.sh without options, but it might not have been for some reason, so doing it manually should fix things. See the rEFInd drivers page for more on this subject.\nIf the Ubuntu icon exists but doesn't work, please post details of what's not working.\nIf you want to boot in BIOS mode using GRUB, you'll need to create a new hybrid MBR. I don't see any reason offhand why gptsync isn't working for you. You might give gdisk a try instead. (This program comes with Ubuntu and is available for OS X.) See the gdisk documentation on hybrid MBRs for information on how to create a hybrid MBR. In your case, it shouldn't really matter what partition(s) go into the hybrid MBR, since neither OS X nor Linux uses the hybrid MBR; you need it just to activate BIOS support in your Mac's EFI.\n", "Q: How to install older skype version?

If you also see an increase of the artefacts when the laptop heats up, it's a pretty sure thing. Also the fact that this started suddenly and on all installed systems supports the theory.\nMaybe it could be possible to disassemble the laptop and change the graphics card, but without looking it up, it sounds more like an integrated chip, maybe even included in the CPU itself, so it is probably impossible to swap that.\nI am sorry for you, but as you're saying it was an old laptop, I guess and hope it does not hurt too much...\n", "Q: compiz CCSM crashed launcher- and windows-bar on Ubuntu 14LTS?

I often install packages and updates for them, although sometimes it is not convenient to do a reboot if one of the packages needs it, so is there any way of telling BEFORE installing the package/update whether or not it will require you to do a reboot? I have already looked here and the solutions there don't solve my problem, nor the more or less same one described there.\n\nA: There's no flag of sorts on packages that indicate that a reboot is required if the package is installed or updated. So, short answer: you can't.\nHowever, you could extract the .deb files of the package before installing or updating to see if a reboot notification is made in the DEBIAN/postinst script. For example, the postinst script in the linux-image-*.deb packages execute the /usr/share/update-notifier/notify-reboot-required script, which in turn creates the /var/run/reboot-required file. Other postinst scripts may use the same method to indicate a necessary reboot, but there's no enforcement of a default method of getting to the creation of the /var/run/reboot-required file. It might be that a package is maintained by someone who isn't really into doing things like other maintainers do, and decides that the reboot notification can also be done in another script, like DEBIAN/preinst. So, long answer: you can, but it'll be a real nightmare to implement and maintain a way to detect all possible reboot notifications.\n", "Q: No Internet Connection when Bluetooth is active (Intel Advanced-N 6230, Ubuntu 14.04) When being connected to a WiFi-network, everything is fine when Bluetooth is disabled.\nWhen Bluetooth is enabled, but not connected, 30 ping packets are lost during the toggling.\nWhen Bluetooth is enabled and connected to a device, there is no internet connection anymore and every ping packet has the following output (e.g):\nFrom www.zeit.de (217.13.68.220) icmp_seq=110 Destination Host Unreachable\nFrom www.zeit.de (217.13.68.220) icmp_seq=111 Destination Host Unreachable\nFrom www.zeit.de (217.13.68.220) icmp_seq=112 Destination Host Unreachable\n\nWhen disabling Bluetooth again, internet resumes working as usual.\nAdditional info:\nWireless-n is disabled having used this command:\nsudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi-opt.conf <<< \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\"\n\nOutput of wireless-info All-In-One script:\nhttp://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=6zr0XQpu\nWhat could be causing this problem?\n\nA: You need also to disable bluetooth coexistence feature.

the entries in each list file and if ANY of the entries in that file has 0 packages installed on the system, regardless of how many entries have packages, it removes the entire file.\nIt also completely disregards any entry that doesn't match a predefined format. It will not take them into account.\nAlso the script works with the entries matched. It leaves the empty files untouched.\nSo I fixed the script like so:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nfor f in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list; do\n    fileTotal=0\n    echo \"FILENAME: $f\"\n\n    while read -r ENTRY ; do\n        echo \"ENTRY: $ENTRY\"\n\n        # Sanitize entry line by removing stuff between square brackets\n        ENTRY=$(echo \"$ENTRY\" | sed 's/\\[.*\\] //')\n\n        HOST=$(cut -d/ -f3 <<< \"$ENTRY\")\n\n        if [ \"ppa.launchpad.net\" = \"$HOST\" ]; then\n          USER=$(cut -d/ -f4 <<< \"$ENTRY\")\n          PPA=$(cut -d/ -f5 <<< \"$ENTRY\")\n          packageCount=$(awk '$1==\"Package:\" {if (a[$2]++ == 0) {system(\"dpkg -l \"$2)}}' /var/lib/apt/lists/*\"$USER\"*\"$PPA\"*Packages 2>/dev/null | awk '/^ii/' | wc -l)\n        else \n          USER=$(cut -d/ -f3 <<< \"$ENTRY\")\n          PPA=$(cut -d/ -f4 <<< \"$ENTRY\")\n          packageCount=$(awk '$1==\"Package:\" {if (a[$2]++ == 0) {system(\"dpkg -l \"$2)}}' /var/lib/apt/lists/*\"$USER\"*Packages 2>/dev/null | awk '/^ii/' | wc -l)\n        fi\n\n        ((fileTotal+=packageCount))\n        printf '\\t%s\\n' \"REPOSITORY: $USER/$PPA\"\n        printf '\\t%s\\n' \"$packageCount package(s) installed\"\n        echo\n    done < <(grep -Po \"(?<=^deb\\s).*?(?=#|$)\" \"$f\")\n\n#    unrecognizedCount=$(grep -Pv \"(?=^deb\\s)|(?=^#).*\" \"$f\" | grep -Pc \"[^\\s]\")\n    unrecognizedCount=0\n    while read -r ENTRY ; do\n        ((unrecognizedCount++))\n        printf '\\t%s\\n' \"Unrecognized entry: $ENTRY\"\n    done < <(grep -Pv \"(?=^deb\\s)|(?=^#).*\" \"$f\" | grep -P \"[^\\s]\")\n\n    echo \"$fileTotal packages installed\"\n    echo \"$unrecognizedCount entries unrecognized\"\n\n    if [ \"$fileTotal\" -eq 0 ] && [ \"$unrecognizedCount\" -eq 0 ]; then\n      if [ \"$1\" == \"--delete\" ]; then\n          sudo rm \"$f\"\n          sudo rm \"$f\".*\n          echo \"$f deleted\"\n      else\n          echo \"Deletable\"\n      fi\n    fi\n\n    echo \"----------------------------\"\ndone\n\nThe usage is exactly the same except --delete option only deletes a file if there's no entry with any installed packages and no unrecognized entries. Blank and commented lines don't count as entries.\nEven having considered everything I can, this is still not tested, safe script to run with sudo privileges. Please backup everything in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory.\n", "Q: Startup disk creator appears to be hanging I try to create a startup disk with Ubuntu 15.04 64bit on a 16G USB stick.\nWhen I start the \"Startup Disk Creator\", it will show progress of \"Copying files...\" until about 49% complete, then hangs forever. No error message shown, no hint if anything is still tried or being done or if I am looking at a corpse. When I press the \"Cancel\" button I get a confirmation dialog showing \"Do you want to quit the installation now?\" but when I click \"Quit\" there, now that dialog also hangs.\nAfter killing the process, when I retried but disabling the extra data region of 1G that it creates by default, the process indicator went to 96% complete and then kept being stuck there.\n\nA: I think this is related to a general problem of copying large files to USB (reported here: copying files to usb stick never finished). \nI just waited for ten minutes and it copied over OK. I don't know if cp is actually being unusually slow, or if the speed is just reported incorrectly. \n\nA: Startup Disk Creator is known to having issues. Use the Disks tool to create the Ubuntu USB installation medium. Open Disks and select the USB drive (on the left) to be used as medium.  \nThen select Restore Disk Image from the menu on the top right of the application. Choose the\nUbuntu installation ISO file - check if the USB drive to write it to is correct and Start restoring.\n\nA: Startup Disk Creator\nThe Startup Disk Creator in versions before Ubuntu 16.04 LTS was affected by several bugs. It was an extracting tool. But in 16.04 LTS, the Startup Disk Creator was converted to a cloning tool, which is very reliable.\nDisks\nUse Disks alias gnome-disks to create the Ubuntu installation media in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and newer versions.\nRestore Disk Image from the menu on the top right of the application will clone from the iso file to the target device (the USB stick).\nmkusb\nInstall and use mkusb in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and newer versions and other main linux distros.\nLink\nSee this link with more links and details.\n", "Q: How to remove a file from usr/share/applications on ubuntu 14.04 I have examined this page (How to remove single file from /usr directory?) and tried \nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/Eclipse Mars C/C++.desktop \n\nin the terminal, but it didn't work.\nI think the reason is that I use a different version (mine is Ubuntu 14.04).\nIs there any solution or any other command for Ubuntu 14.04 to remove the files which aren't wanted?\n\nA: It's because the file name contains spaces. Therefore the rm command interprets it as multiple arguments, which is not intended and obviously fails.\nYou need to put the file name in quotation marks to be passed as single argument:\nsudo rm \"/usr/share/applications/Eclipse Mars C/C++.desktop\"\n\nBut as especially @JacobVlijm has pointed out, Eclipse Mars C/C++.desktop is no valid file name, because of about the only character that may not be included in file names, because it separates directories: the / (slash).\nIf the command as described above really worked, that means you have the file C++.desktop inside the directory /usr/share/applications/Eclipse Mars C, which is very unlikely, as this is not the recommended structure for the .../applications directories.\nBut if we assume that this file really exists as described in the previous paragraph, there is another possible way to enter the file name correctly. You can escape all spaces with a \\ (backslash) instead of quoting the entire name:\nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/Eclipse\\ Mars\\ C/C++.desktop\n\nBut note that rm only removes files, not directories. As we assume (because everything else is theoretically impossible) that Eclipse Mars C/C++.desktop is not a file, but a file in a subdirectory, we don't have achieved what we want yet, as there would still be the (probably empty) directory /usr/share/applications/Eclipse Mars C remaining. To also remove this subdirectory and all contained files (so you may omit the commands above to delete the file only), we have to use one of the command variants below:\nsudo rm -r \"/usr/share/applications/Eclipse Mars C\"\nsudo rm -r /usr/share/applications/Eclipse\\ Mars\\ C\n\nNote that we now don't refer to the file name, but the directory name only. And we use the -r parameter for rm, which stands for \"delete recursively\".\n\nA: Try typing the command like this:\nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/Eclipse\\ Mars\\ C\n\nAnd press TAB. It will auto-complete, at which point you should run the command, and it will remove. Putting it in quotes MIGHT work, but there's also a / in the name, so it might cause errors, so it's better to let Bash handle it for you.\n\nA: Try:\nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/Eclipse\\ Mars\\ C\\/C++.desktop\n\nOr just let the terminal write the name by typing:\nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/Eclipse\n\nand hitting TAB, in case I'm wrong with the backslashes\n", "Q: What task to select in tasksel during lubuntu alternate install to get a default system I'm installing Lubuntu 14.04.1 from the alternate Image. At the \"tasksel\" step I would like to select the same tasks that would be installed with the desktop installer.\nThere's a task called \"Lubuntu desktop\" Is that all I need to select? Or is something like \"Samba Server\" \"Print Server\" included in the dekstop install?\nAdded: It's not Lubuntu but During Debian 8 installation I found \"Print Server\" and sth like \"Base Desktop\" and \".... System tools\" ticked by default\n\nA: Yes, the Lubuntu Desktop task is all that is required.

Starting from an installation of ubuntu-standard or ubuntu-minimal,  installing the -desktop package is all that's needed to get the corresponding flavour setup. In this case, you can see that this task installs the lubuntu-desktop package, which is exactly what you need.\nIf a default Lubuntu installation comes with a Samba server or a print server, then lubuntu-desktop will depend on these directly or indirectly. So you do not need to select these tasks unless you explicitly want to install them.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 \"Check disk for errors\" always returns 2 errors I'm trying to install Ubuntu 14.04.3 on my system and no matter what I've tried I always get 2 errors on my bootable media. For reference. I checked the md5sum of my install, which worked. I tried creating the bootable drive using Universal USB Creator which gave me the 2 errors. I tried in both USB 2.0 and 3.0 slots on different computers with different drives. I then created the boot drive manually on my mac, still the same 2 errors found. These are all installs across different computers I checked out with md5sum, but no avail. I'm beginning to think there might be something wrong with the check for errors offered through ubuntu.\nAnyone have any insight into this issue?\n\nA: I had the same problem, Universal USB Installer has a bug, use Unetbootin instead, Unetbootin is even specialized for Ubuntu.\nhttps://unetbootin.github.io/\nThe iso file is OK if the checksums match.\n", "Q: Live USB does not boot after hard reset I have created a Live USB with Linux Mint 17 “Qiana” Xfce 64-bit using Unetbootin, and booted successfully (more than once).

Because ldlinux.sys is not listed. \nI would like to replace the file ldlinux.sys on linux-mint-17a to see if this makes the Live USB bootable again, but I see no way to do this. It is apparently untouchable since not even root can chown or chmod it. \nUPDATE 2015-09-17 21:10 UTC\nI have been able to remove ldlinux.sys on linux-mint-17a by removing the immutable flag, and replaced it with ldlinux.sys of linux-mint-17b. linux-mint-17a does not boot (error message “Missing operating system”). \n\nA: This is a simple fix, you will just need 3 things.\n1) Root access.\n2) A directory path to your flashdrive.\n3) Your profile name (A.K.A The user name)\nIn this case I will use USER as the user name, but make sure you replace USER with whatever your user-name is.\nI will be using /home/USER/media/flashdrive/.....

Since last night, the computer always boots directly into Windows, even booting from USB seems impossible - which then stops me from running the usual boot repair tools\nI checked the BIOS and it looks ok to me. Secure boot is off, the UEFI boot order is: USB, Ubuntu, Windows (all of which appear in the menu). I turned off fast boot in the Windows power options.\nI can only assume Windows 10 did something to my computer last night, but I cannot figure out what. How do I restore the grub boot loader if USB boot is not working either?\n\nA: I actually found an odd solution in Windows.\nGo to Settings -> Updates & Recovery, and look around until you find advanced boot options. Click restart now, and choose Ubuntu. That should work\n", "Q: \"Guest has not initialized the display yet\". when starting to run VM that is ppc64el Explanation:\nI work for IBM and trying to prototype netboot (pxe) for ubuntu.\nThe goal is to have a maas deployment server deploy out to 4 VMs managed under ubuntu 14.0.4 to test out juju bundle #39 (openstack base).  Since my team does not have 4 physical servers we are attempting this using VMs.  Note this is ppc64el environment.\nProblem\nWith a installed mini.iso for netboot (pxe) in a VM we encounter \"Guest has not initialized the display yet\".   VM does not boot, goes to paused and maas cannot be used for this VM.\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*The netboot mini.iso from wiki.ubuntu.com/ppc64el.  \nCan it be used to establish a VM to boot from pxe?  \nAre these only for installation on bare metal?\n\n*I found this at https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-discuss/2015-03/msg00027.html that says \"kernel that won't work on this board model\" or \"kernel has no graphics support\".   This is leading me to believe that using the\nnetboot/pxe mini.iso cannot be done in VM and needs to be bare metal.  \nIs putting the netboot iso into VM possible?\n Is it not possible because the VM emulation graphics card is not \n supported for the mini.iso?\n\nQEMU window opens up, but I am getting this error \"Guest has not initialized\n  the display yet\"\n  I had enabled -sdl option while configuring qemu, but I am still getting\n  that error.\n\nThis isn't an error. It is just QEMU telling you that the guest OS\nhas not yet done what it needs to do to turn on the emulated graphics\ncard and display output.\nIn this case the likely reason for this is that you've tried to\nrun a kernel that won't work on this board model, and so it has\ncrashed before it got anywhere. You can also see this message\nif the kernel has no graphics support built in and is just doing\noutput to serial console.\n\n\n*If we can use netboot mini.iso for VM what are we doing wrong in the xml \ndocument defintion for the graphics?\n\n\nvm6.xml or parts of it that are relevant \n/usr/bin/qemu-system-ppc64le\n<controller type='usb' index='0'>\n  <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x01' function='0x2'/>\n</controller>\n<controller type='pci' index='0' model='pci-root'/>\n<controller type='virtio-serial' index='0'>\n  <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x04' function='0x0'/>\n</controller>\n<interface type='bridge'>\n  <mac address='00:1a:64:30:12:11'/>\n  <source bridge='br3'/>\n  <model type='rtl8139'/>\n  <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x03' function='0x0'/>\n</interface>\n<serial type='pty'>\n  <target port='0'/>\n  <address type='spapr-vio' reg='0x30000000'/>\n</serial>\n<console type='pty'>\n  <target type='serial' port='0'/>\n  <address type='spapr-vio' reg='0x30000000'/>\n</console>\n<input type='tablet' bus='usb'/>\n<input type='keyboard' bus='usb'/>\n<input type='mouse' bus='usb'/>\n<graphics type='vnc' port='-1' autoport='yes' keymap='en-us'/>\n\nEnvirionment Info\n\n\n*\n\n*Server: ubuntu 14.04 trusty - ppc64el \n\n*/wiki.ubuntu.com/ppc64el netboot mini.iso being used\n\n*juju:  //jujucharms.com/u/james-page/openstack-base/bundle/39/\n\n*Openstack with ceph storage, requires 4 machines\n\n*using maas to boot VMs:\naskubuntu.com/questions/292061/how-to-configure-maas-to-be-able-to-boot-virtual-machines\nOutcome Added Sep 22, 2015\n==========================\nExplanation of what was done to make things work and example of xml (XML Code secion). The xml helps to start making ppc64le work to get to running state (not paused).  Once we got the VM to running state we still had to modify \nin virt-manager to setup scsi disk for deployed vm.  The XML code below is\nthe version that was finally modified in virt-manager with 8G scsi disk.\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*Need to run ppc64_cpu --smt=off\n\n*xml: Needed to specify arch ppc64\n\n*xml: Used qemu-system-ppc64 qemu\nAdded on 10/07/2014.  I forgot to mention that the xml has to be changed\nto use VNC console.    See the supplied XML.  Need to use VNC.  Have to \nhave the console tags, which I believe should be there.  Also if you setup\nXML you may run into issue with bus slot definition where it says already\nused slots.  If this is the case you may have to adjust bus/slot numbers\nas shown in example below.\n<console type='pty'>\n  <target type='serial' port='0'/>\n  <address type='spapr-vio' reg='0x30000000'/>\n</console>\n\n<graphics type='vnc' port='-1' autoport='yes' listen='0.0.0.0' keymap='en-us'>\n  <listen type='address' address='0.0.0.0'/>\n</graphics>\n\n\n*Note that this gets vm into running state.   \n\n*Now the original xml contained mini.iso .  However once running in maas the\nvm commissioned to ready state.  Then when deployed (start button) hit issue\nwhere VM started up but failed deployment.  From virt-manager removed the\nmini-iso and created a scsi disk of 8G.  The scsi disk is needed my maas\nto put the deployed OS (in our case ubuntu 14.04 trusty).\nNote on virt-manager: Using virt-manager makes things real easy.  Our setup\nused private network and we normally use vnc to connect to servers.  The\nserver that has all the VMs on it (the VM server) we connect to via vnc.\nNow from there we tried to connect via vnc to the maas deployment server\n(on a ubuntu 15.04 level).  We could not make vnc work on the 15.04\nserver.  So we used ssh -X xll forwarding.  Not the solution for product\nlevel but if you are testing this environment out this works in a pinch.\n\n*Note that to access the ubuntu properly you need to setup the ssh keys as\nspecified by ubuntu documentation.  \nSee: /maas.ubuntu.com/docs/nodes.html\nNote we used root for our testing so if you do this for testing\nthen maas userid does not have to be setup and just ssh-keygen (this is \ndone on maas deployment server).\nThe target server that has the VMs (VM server in the doc) needs the public \nkey so ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@x.x.x.x has to be done and you\nhave to use ubuntu userid.  The ubuntu userid is the default userid of \ndeployed VMs.\nOnce the above is done you can access the deployed VM from the VM server\nusing something like this  ssh ubuntu@x.x.x.x  (x.x.x.x is the ip address\nof created ubuntu VM)\n\n*Once this was fixed mass deployed to the server ubuntu 14.04.\nIf you run virt-manager you can see the sequence of processing during deploy.\n\n*Now in the test case we ran observed in virt-manager that the boot sequence\nwas still off network so changed that to disk.  Stopped VM, restarted VM\nand came up with ubuntu 14.04.  \n\n*Connect to the newly created VM using ssh ubuntu@x.x.x.x  (x.x.x.x is the \nipaddress of created ubuntu VM).  Note you can obtain the newly created\nipaddress from the edit node page, go to bottom and select discovered \ninformation.  ipaddress is listed in that area a ways down, probably better\nto copy to a notepad, editor and then search for address start.  We used\nprivate network so just searched for 192.\nUse uname -a and lscpu to check if OS is correct.

For these virtual machines, you're better off using a serial connection to the host.\nSince it looks like you're using libvirt, and your .xml file seems to define a host serial port, you can use a standard virsh command to grab the host console:\nvirsh console <name>\n\nYou might also want to remove the graphics configuration from your VM.\n", "Q: High resolution screen creates tiny icons and text with Mate desktop I find it odd that in the year 2015, there is still a problem with operating systems not dealing correctly with higher DPI values. So if the resolution is high for the same screen size, all fonts, icons, panels, windows etc. will be relatively too small, and sometimes just tiny.\nIt seems that there may be a partial solution for that in Unity, but I am using the Mate desktop. Is there a way to just scale everything up so it is bigger - fonts, icons, panels etc?\nMy resolution is 2880x1620 on a 15 inch monitor and everything is so tiny it is completely impossible to use. \nI could decrease the screen resolution, but the alternative, lower resolution lead to different aspect ratios, thus distorting everything. \nIt also seems wrong to lower the resolution just to fix this, instead of the OS scaling the size up at the higher resolution, which should show better, more crisp graphics and fonts.\n\nA: For the MATE desktop, I finally found a solution. It is well hidden and hard to find, I think.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the desktop and choose Change Desktop Background \nOR: choose System -> Preferences -> Appearance.\n\n*Choose the Fonts tab.\n\n*Click the Details button.\n\n*On the top of the dialog there is a Resolution entry field where you can enter or increase the DPI setting. Setting this to the true DPI of the display scales up everything too much, but with a little tinkering it is possible to find a good value. \n\n\nUpdate 1: Under Gnome3, it is also possible to rescale the fonts by specifying a scaling factor in the gnome-tweak-tool.\nThe gnome-tweak-tool also has a scaling factor for windows, but this only allows to specify integer value! So 1 is tiny and 2 is way too big!\nUpdate 2: Cinnamon seems to be the only desktop manager which provides support for HiDPI out of the box! Everything is nicely scaled right from the start. Unfortunately, I had frequent problems with the display locking up or becoming unresponsive, so either it is not stable yet or it has issues with my specific hardware or configuration. But what Cinnamon has achieved is exactly what I would have expected for Unity, Gnome3, or KDE to do!\nUpdate 3: Situation is even worse with a dual monitor setup: With Gnome3, the window manager that is the best compromise between stability and HiDPI support so far, dual monitor setup does not work at all: the login screen gets shown on both monitors, but as soon as I log into Gnome3, both screen flicker endlessly between a black screen and a switched off screen. If I unplug the second monitor everything is fine again.\nUnder Unity the dual monitor setup works, but the scaling does not: windows on the second, lower resolution monitor are now too big, fonts are huge etc. \n\nA: You could turn on Accessibility features, and also under display settings increase the scale size (I know this is an option in Unity, not sure if it is with MATE)\n\nA: Also the (bottom) panel (and its icons) can be enlarged by right-clicking on it and selecting 'properties' / Size  (be sure 'Expand' is checked) and as you increase the settings, immediate results can be seen seen.  \n\nA: In case you need increase buttons size (min, max close)\nyou can read my last anwser in:\nhttps://ubuntu-mate.community/t/can-i-change-the-minimise-maximise-and-close-window-button-size/16508/19\nIn resume, you can get Ambiant theme with bigger icons, the \"new\" theme is called Ambiant Laptopv02\nYou can download ⬇ here:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1MjiVNCM5vJyDmaevdkQC42Wr_d0v4DBp/view?usp=sharing.

Don't forget the virtual command ends with the ufw reload command.\nThis is all part of a home surveillance system, headless server running Ubuntu 15.04.  I chose knockd because firewall blacklist makers I've seen don't catch and blacklist the perp on the very first probe.  With knockd, I can set a /etc/knockd.conf rule to blacklist a perp's IP based on a single hit from it on my port 22, 80, 443, whatever I want.  My ufw rules have three sections: \n\n\n*\n\n*Denys of single IPs of blacklisted perps (creating themselves via a ufw insert 1 deny from %IP% to any; ufw reload command in /etc/knockd.conf), \n\n*Allows of single IPs of successful knockers (me from my locations, this is the command I need help with because it has to be inserted to the dynamically calculated line after the blacklisted perps), \n\n*two static denys that cover the world.\n\n\nA: Try this:\nufw insert $(sed -n '/ALLOW/{s/^.*ALLOW *\\[ *\\([0-9]\\+\\).*$/\\1/;p;q}' <(ufw status numbered)) allow from '%IP%' to any; ufw reload\n\n", "Q: What did I do to my file?

Any help ?\n\nA: You can tweak the sensitivity from xinput.\nFirst thing is get to know the touchpad id with:\n$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad                  id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n........\n\nSo my touchpad is ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad with id 13.\nNow check the acceleration profile with it:\n$ xinput list-props 13 | grep Accel\nDevice Accel Profile (262): 1\nDevice Accel Constant Deceleration (263):   2.500000\nDevice Accel Adaptive Deceleration (264):   1.000000\nDevice Accel Velocity Scaling (265):    12.500000\n\nThe value for Device Accel Constant Deceleration (263) is the one that you will need to change.\nYou can decrease this value to reduce the deceleration (make it faster) by:\n$ xinput set-prop 13 263 1.25\n\nThe number 13 here is the ID of your touchpad, 263 here is the option that you want to change, 1.25 will make it twice faster, you can try it out to see what value fits your expectation.\nReference: How can I set mouse sensitivity, not just mouse acceleration?\n\nA: I was able to solve it long time back itself. Posting the solution today - \nYou can modify the touchpad speed using the following commands (in your terminal): \n\"synclient AccelFactor=0.5\" \n\"synclient MinSpeed=3\" \n\"synclient MaxSpeed=7\" \nHigher values mean higher sensitivity. AccelFactor is the acceleration, how fast does the cursor move if you try to move your pointer. MinSpeed and MaxSpeed put a lower and upper limit to the speeds with which it can move.\n\nA: I'm using this;\nxset m 2 1\nsynclient TouchpadOff=1\n\nfrom top of my head, so don't pin it on me, the first [xset], made the mouse twice as fast. The second [synclient] disabled the touchpad which can become an annoyance, if one uses the trackpoint regularly.\n", "Q: Backup Trouble same drive mounted to / and /backups with RSYNC So I'm getting a root partition as full after some errors.

Reboot later Reboot now or similar to this (I'm seeing a translated version of it).\nThis is annoying, especially as it keeps popping up maybe hourly or so even after I refused to reboot now. I shut the machine down daily anyway and therefore it's not important for me to be reminded of this.\nHow do I disable this window from popping up, or how can I configure it to stay closed after I clicked on Reboot later once?\n\nWhat I already did is to set the software updater to never automatically look for updates, but this is of course not related to the reboot prompt:\n\nI also have modified the dconf key com.ubuntu.update-notifier/no-show-notifications to True using dconf-editor, but the window still appears.\n\n\nA: When you install updates, two files are created in /run which are read to determine if updates require rebooting: reboot-required and reboot-required.pkgs, one of which is just a string indicating a reboot is needed and one which shows which package(s) is calling for it.\nYou can (as root or with sudo) rm these two files and that should do it.  Truncating them is not enough - they must not exist.  Curiously, I cannot find anything in the /etc/apt files about this and my only real clue came from /etc/update-motd.d pointing to /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-reboot-required (which is called by SSH on login to indicate a reboot is required), and which has the following code in it:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# helper for update-motd\n\nif [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ]; then\n    cat /var/run/reboot-required\nfi\n\n/var/run is a symlink to /run, so there is my answer.

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 (Cinnamon Mint 17.1) with Bash.  Every time I open a new terminal window, I enter screen to start the screen window manager, but I would like the shell to do this for me.\nI believe I need to modify .bashrc instead of .profile, so it starts on every new terminal window, not just on logon.  So I've added the following to the end of .bashrc, to replace the shell process:\nexec /usr/bin/screen -q\n\nWhen I start a new terminal window:\n\n\n*\n\n*Usually, I get a blank window with a flashing cursor, and the Bash prompt only appears after I press Ctrl+C.\n\n*Sometimes, the terminal window closes immediately, when I press Ctrl+C, or when I resize the terminal window.\n\n*Sometimes, I get a Bash prompt with no $LS_COLORS (though it's hard to reproduce this, so I'm not entirely sure when or why it happens).\n\n\nCan anyone explain why this is failing for me, and suggest a solution?\nThanks,\nHuw\n\nA: When screen starts, the first window launches your shell, and you've told your shell to start screen. Then, when screen starts, the first window launches your shell, and you've told your shell to start screen. Then, when screen starts ...\nLather, rinse, repeat.\nscreen sets the $TERM variable to \"screen\", so to avoid endlessly recursive invocations of screen (\"turtles all the way down\") your .bashrc can end with:\n[[ $TERM != \"screen\" ]] && exec screen -q\n\n", "Q: Restore Python installation to default plus apt package dependencies I have played around a lot with my Python installations (2 and 3) and installed a bunch of packages, some using apt-get, but most using pip. I have also upgraded many apt-installed packages with pip to a newer version.\nMy question is:\nHow can I reverse all those changes, remove all pip-installed Python packages and just keep the default set of preinstalled packages in their default repository version, plus those installed by apt-get but only as dependency of other software, always downgrading to the repository version if necessary.\nI want to do this to have a tidied up Python environment for the system and have my modifications in virtualenvs only.\nIs that possible without a system reinstall? How would I approach it?\n\nA: I would start by listing the Python packages managed by apt-get (the following one-liner takes a few seconds to run, be patient):\n$ for pyfile in `ls /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`; do dpkg -S \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/${pyfile}\" | sed 's/:.*//g'; done | sort -u\n\nNote: if necessary, replace 2.7 with whatever python version you're interested in.\nNext, uninstall the packages you installed manually. If you are unsure which ones you installed, you can get the list of all packages installed manually using the following command (see this question):\n$ comm -23 <(apt-mark showmanual | sort -u) <(gzip -dc /var/log/installer/initial-status.gz | sed -n 's/^Package: //p' | sort -u)\n\nThen uninstall the Python packages you installed manually, for example:\n$ sudo apt-get remove python-tk python-scipy\n\nNext, you want to know which packages you installed using pip:\n$ ls -ltd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/*\n\nThis command lists the contents of pip's install directory sorted by last modification date, making it easier to find the packages you installed yourself. For example, I installed Google's gcloud tool which installs a bunch of pip packages that I don't want to uninstall, but looking through the list it's easy to see that they were all installed at the same exact time, so I know which ones I should leave, and which ones I can uninstall. Before you uninstall any pip package, you should take a snapshot of the list of packages installed:\n$ sudo pip freeze > $HOME/pip_freeze_snapshot.txt\n\nThen just uninstall the packages you want, for example:\n$ sudo pip uninstall py pytest\n\nFinally, don't forget that some pip packages may have been installed in your user directory. Perhaps you're fine with that, but if not, you can list them:\n$ ls -ltd $HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/*\n\nIf you want to get rid of all these packages you can just delete this directory. Otherwise, just uninstall the individual packages, for example:\n$ pip uninstall tensorflow\n\nDon't forget to check for other python versions (e.g., 3.5).\n", "Q: Postfix can send but not receive mails - Recipient address rejected I have an Ubuntu 14.04 Server with Postfix 2.11.0 and 2.2.9\nSince the last weekend my mailserver can only send emails but not receive them.\nAny help is much appreciated! :-)\nThe Error in mail.log file say:\nSep 17 09:31:21 trinity postfix/smtpd[7786]: connect from outmail235.swisscom.com[193.222.81.235]\nSep 17 09:31:21 trinity postfix/smtpd[7786]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from outmail235.swisscom.com[193.222.81.235]: 550 5.1.1 <n0_ah@*masked*>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in virtual mailbox table; from=<*masked*@*masked*rants.ch> to=<n0_ah@*masked*> proto=ESMTP helo=<mail.swisscom.com>\nSep 17 09:31:21 trinity postfix/smtpd[7786]: disconnect from outmail235.swisscom.com[193.222.81.235]\n\nAnd this is the output of postconf -nf:\nalias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases, hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/aliases\nappend_dot_mydomain = no\nbroken_sasl_auth_clients = yes\nconfig_directory = /etc/postfix\ndisable_vrfy_command = yes\ndovecot_destination_recipient_limit = 1\ninet_interfaces = all\ninet_protocols = ipv4\nlocal_recipient_maps = $alias_maps $virtual_alias_maps\nmailman_destination_recipient_limit = 1\nmydestination = $myhostname localhost.$mydomain localhost\nmydomain = roundedge.ch\nmyhostname = mail.roundedge.ch\nmynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 1.2.3.4/32 5.9.194.36\npostscreen_greet_action = enforce\nrelay_domains = $mydestination\nsmtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache\nsmtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name (Ubuntu)\nsmtpd_client_new_tls_session_rate_limit = 10\nsmtpd_client_restrictions = check_client_access cidr:/etc/postfix/drop.cidr\nsmtpd_data_restrictions = reject_multi_recipient_bounce\nsmtpd_delay_reject = no\nsmtpd_helo_required = yes\nsmtpd_helo_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated,\n    reject_non_fqdn_hostname, reject_invalid_hostname, permit\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions = reject_unauth_pipelining,\n    reject_non_fqdn_recipient, reject_unknown_recipient_domain,\n    permit_sasl_authenticated, permit_mynetworks, permit\nsmtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes\nsmtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous\nsmtpd_sender_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated,\n    reject_non_fqdn_sender reject_unknown_sender_domain\nsmtpd_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/private/startssl/sub.class2.server.ca.pem\nsmtpd_tls_auth_only = yes\nsmtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/private/wildecard/server.crt\nsmtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/ssl/private/wildecard/server.key\nsmtpd_tls_loglevel = 0\nsmtpd_tls_security_level = may\nsmtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtpd_scache\nsmtpd_use_tls = yes\ntls_random_source = dev:/dev/urandom\ntransport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport\nvirtual_alias_maps = hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman,\n    proxy:ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap_virtual_aliases.cf\nvirtual_gid_maps = static:5000\nvirtual_mailbox_domains = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual_domains\nvirtual_mailbox_maps = proxy:ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap_virtual_recipients.cf\nvirtual_transport = dovecot\nvirtual_uid_maps = static:5000\n\n\nA: Quite honestly - error states quite clearly, where is the problem. \nIn your virtual mailbox table. \nIt says that user hasn't been found there, hence incoming mail hasn't been accepted. \nI see you're using ldap for virtual users/mailboxes and aliases records - so first of all check if you can connect to your ldap server and, if so - whether your ldap records are in proper order.\n", "Q: Some scripts (languages) are missing in my Character Map I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nIn my character-map some scripts (Languages) are missing.  \nHow can I get them?

Unfortunately for you, this is not an error that is easy to fix, but it is very easy to tell you why it is happening. USB 2.0 was built to receive only a certain amount and type of information from the device in it, while USB 3.0 was made to receive almost all of it. It seems that the extension you have turns 2.0 into 3.0. So basically, the problem is that your laptop USB 2.0, which isn't supported by your mouse.

I have installed exactly the same OS version on a VirtualBox guest running on Windows 8 guest machine.\nBoth machines have internet connectivity. \nBy running ifconfig on both machines, I obtained the I.P addresses of the server and VBox guests as:\n192.168.1.9\n10.0.2.15\n\nNow, I can ping the server machine from the VBox guest, but can't ping the VBox guest from the server machine.\nI want to be able to log onto the server machine (as myself - both machines have the same logon name and password), from the VBox machine.\nWhat do I nedd to do in order to be abe to connect onto the server machine from the VBox guest - as myself (i.e. a remote login)?\n\nA: You have a few different options open to you.  A 'default' connection in a VM will be set to \"NAT\".\n\nWhat NAT essentially does is it makes your computer act a little like a router, routing traffic between the VMs and the connection that the computer is on.  Essentially, the VMs 'masquerade' to other things on your network or to the internet as your computer (or the router your computer is behind, if it's behind a router).\nYou have to edit the NAT settings in VirtualBox to forward traffic to the VM.  This does not include, unfortunately, ICMP Pings, such as those generated by the 'ping' command.  It operates on the same basis of port forwarding that Routers use.  (Except it's a much simpler thing than what routers can do.)\n\nYou may also want to consider using Bridged Networking instead, which makes the VM utilize the host's network card, but gives it its own IP on the network.  While this is 'okay' to some extent, it's not the most useful option available to you, as Bridged Networking doesn't work well with 'secured' networks.  And if you're on a wireless adapter, Bridged Networking won't give your VM 'wireless' powers.\n\nA: Probably easiest thing to do would be to change Network interface configuration in Virtualbox and instead of Guest NAT choose Bridged networking. That way virtual machine will be in the same network as Server (as I understand Ubuntu server and Windows host are on the same network, since you can ping Ubuntu from within nated virtual machine).\nThe reason why you can't ping vm from server is that it has only connection through Windows host, thus it acts as NAT gateway.\n\nA: Another alternative I use with a Windows 10 host and an Ubuntu 16 guest is to use two network adapters on the guest:\n\n\n*\n\n*A NAT network adapter that can be used for the guest to connect to the Internet, and\n\n*A Host-only network adapter that the guest and host can connect to each other through.\n\n", "Q: How to write a Debian/rule to copy the file to its target?

I read on website (http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/security#firewallantivirus) the following phrase:\n\"By default, Ubuntu ships with no open ports on public interfaces.\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Does that mean that if I got infected by a keylogger my computer would not send information to the hacker's computer?\n\n*Is it possible to download an application (virus/malware) that would open a port on public interface if it had root access?\n\n*How do I check for open ports on public interfaces? I know netstat -a, netstat, nmap -v localhost, nmap -v -p1-65535 localhost, but they all show different information so I am not sure.\n\n*Using nmap -v -p1-65535 localhost my computer finds two ports:\nDiscovered open port 631/tcp on 127.0.0.1\nDiscovered open port 51072/tcp on 127.0.0.1\nDoes the IP at the end mean that it's not being sent to another computer?\nSorry for asking so much questions, I have been reading about this subject in two different languages for two days and I still can't answer those.\n\nA: \nBy default, Ubuntu ships with no open ports on public interfaces.\n\nNot entirely true. Technically speaking, Ubuntu ships with minimum open ports, particularly 631, which is for network printing. But such services as mail transfer, ssh, ftp - they all require a server software installed on your machine. For instance , ssh port 22 is open on my machine only after I installed openssh-server. \nThat doesn't mean you're 100% safe, only 89% safe. The other 10%  can be added by enabling the default firewall or installing your own.\n\nDoes that mean that if I got infected by a keylogger my computer would not send information to the hacker's computer?\n\nI am no information security professional, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were keyloggers that send information through port 80, which is the standard port for internet stuff. Browsers do that, for instance. So the answer is , information could still escape your computer\n\nIs it possible to download an application (virus/malware) that would open a port on public interface if it had root access?\n\nYes. As I described a little earlier if you install ftp or ssh servers, you get ports 25 and 22 open, and you install them as root; So what stops malware doing the same if it has root access ? Exactly nothing.\n\nHow do I check for open ports on public interfaces? I know netstat -a, netstat, nmap -v localhost, nmap -v -p1-65535 localhost, but they all show different information so I am not sure.\n\nnetstat and nmap are two of the basic and best command-line utilities that are used by system administrators across the world. They're already good, but require learning a bit about the flags.\nnetstat -tulpan is what I personally use in my checks. This shows all TCP and UDP connections, including listening ones and prints out the connections in ip address (numeric ) format. If there's an IP address that is suspicious , it can be checked with nslookup or dig or whois. In addition the -pflag will tell you what program is using which port or has connection established. That is pretty useful, you can later lookup that process as well as process id, eventually locating the executable file.\nnmap is good for scanning local network as well as your own machine. Personally I use sudo nmap -sT -T4 -n 192.168.0.1/24 on my local network to check pretty quickly all the devices on my network, including my own machine. I can see what computers are on the network. \n\nUsing nmap -v -p1-65535 localhost my computer finds two ports: Discovered open port 631/tcp on 127.0.0.1 Discovered open port 51072/tcp on 127.0.0.1 Does the IP at the end mean that it's not being sent to another computer?\n\nWhen you scan with localhost , that means you're scanning your own computer. Localhost,or the address that computer refers to itself, is set to 127.0.0.1. It's like asking yourself Who am I ? Well, I am me would be the response.\nThat means you have ports 51072  and 631 open. 631 is open by default, but 51072 is a little trickier. Ports from 1024 to 65534 are used to establish temporary connections, for example by internet browsers. Typically they're opened and then closed, but if it's persistent you may already have some form of malware installed, not necessarily a keylogger. \nI'd suggest you disconnect the computer from the network immediately. Examine your Autostart entries, change password with sudo passwd $USER, enable Ubuntu's default firewall with sudo sed -i 's;ENABLED=no;ENABLED=yes;g' /etc/ufw/ufw.conf. Make sure you change/enable the router admin password (not the wifi password, the actual password that allows you make settings changes to your router), preferably from another computer.\nAfter that you should be able to return to your internet browsing, but you may want to observe your connections, ports, behavior of the machine. Avoid doing anything that could compromise important passwords and logins. If you still have an issue, consider asking information security professionals for help. \n\nA: *\n\n*No; if your machine doesn't have any open ports, that just makes infection harder in the first place. If you have malware on your machine, it most likely beacons out, which is rarely stopped.\n\n*Malware opening ports isn't that common against clients. They often sit behind a NAT firewall, so (as long as they don't have uPnP enabled) even if they had a port open, only the local network can communicate with them.\n\n*As Serg said, netstat -tulpan is your friend for seeing what traffic is going on. Try running from a console rather than a GUI (switch from the GUI login with Ctrl-Alt-F1), and then work up to a GUI, slowly starting your normal programmes so you can identify when connections are starting.\n\n*Anything bound to 127.0.0.1 is internal, and not accessible to anything other than your device. TCP 631 is the printer service, and TCP 51072 is an Ephemeral port, just waiting for a response. netstat -tulpan will help you identify the process using that port. These aren't anything particularly suspicious.\n", "Q: ssh into a server and download data So I've been using this command \ntar zcf - * | ssh root@ip \"tar xzf - -C home/minecraft/multicraft/servers/server2\"\n\nto upload stuff to other servers.

Specifically, Virtualbox 5.0.4. However, when I try to install a virtual machine, it only gives me the option to install a 32-bit OS (as seen below). Is there a way to allow 64-bit OSes?\n\n\nA: May be your system is 32 bit, if not i.e if it is 64 bit machine then may be the virtualization technology is not enabled in BIOS. you have to enable virtualization technology in BIOS..you can find relevant videos on how to enable virtualization through BIOS.\n\nA: This is normal if your CPU does not have hardware support for virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-v). Older 64-bit CPUs may not support this.  \nI'm quoting the below one from the Virtualbox forum moderator\n\nYou can install 64bit guests on 32bit hosts, so the \"bittedness\" of\n  the host is not the issue. The issue is that in VirtualBox, hardware\n  support for virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-v) is required for\n  certain VMs, which includes all 64bit VMs - regardless of the host.\nTo enable 64bit guests, run through the following checklist :-\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Note your exact CPU model or part number, then go online and check its capabilities. The CPU must have 64bit capability and support\n  either Intel or AMD virtualization technologies: VT-x or AMD-v.\n  \n*You usually need to enable VT-x/AMD-v in the host PC BIOS. You need to check with your PC manual or support forum to find out how to boot\n  into the BIOS screen. This is probably not something we here at the\n  VirtualBox forums can help you with. Once you get there you need to\n  look for something buried in a menu, perhaps in the security category.\n  The option may be called something like \"Enable Virtualization\n  Technology\". If you see \"Virtual Directed I/O\" then that is a\n  different thing. Remember to reboot your host PC after making BIOS\n  changes - in this case a full restart from power off is required, just\n  resuming from a hibernated state may not do the job.\n  \n*If (1) and (2) are already taken care of, then make sure that no other host apps are already using VT-x/AMD-v. The usual culprits are\n  system level debuggers, other VM platforms, and some resident\n  anti-virus applications. This has become a particular issue with 64bit\n  Windows desktop and server hosts - especially Win8/Win2k12/Win10,\n  since these may enable Microsoft's Hyper-v VM platform by default:\n  this grabs ownership of VT-x and won't play nice with VirtualBox.\n  \n*When creating a VM, make sure you choose the 64-bit version of the guest OS template in  | General | Basic | Version, e.g.\n  choose \"Ubuntu (64 bit)\" and not \"Ubuntu\" or \"Ubuntu (32bit)\". This\n  has become more important since VirtualBox 4.3.x, because choosing the\n  correct template also allows other modern processor features to be\n  visible to the guest - it's not just about 64bit capability any more.\n\n", "Q: Remove PPAs: \"add-apt-repository --remove\" vs. \"rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/???.list\" According to How can PPAs be removed? there are mainly 3 methods to get rid of a PPA:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the add-apt-repository command:\nsudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:???/???\n\n\n*Manually remove the .list file:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/????.list\n\n\n*Use additional tools like e.g. ppa-purge... (not topic of this question)\nI am curious what the difference between the first and second option is, i.e. is there anything more that add-apt-repository --remove does, compared to just deleting the .list file?\nOne example I could think of would be GPG keys that were installed together with the PPA. Will add-apt-repository handle and remove them in contrast to just rm-ing the .list file? \nPlease note that neither removing GPG keys nor using ppa-purge is the topic of this question!\n\nA: Both commands remove the PPA, but there is one basic difference:\nsudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:???/???\n\nThis command will only delete content of .list file. It will not remove the file itself.\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/????.list\n\nOnce you run this command, it will completely remove the PPA file. \nHowever, in my opinion, it's better to use :\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/????.list*\n\nI generally use the last command with the trailing asterisk (*), because whenever we add any repository it will create two files under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. First one is the .list file and second one is a backup of that, having the extension .list.save.  \nsame case with command  sudo apt-key del ???? and sudo rm /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/file.gpg. whenever we add keys two file created under  /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ file.gpg and file.gpg~ when you run command \nsudo apt-key del ????\n\none file file.gpg will be deleted and second one will remain file.gpg~ as it is . \nHowever, in my opinion, it's better to use :\nsudo rm /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/file.gpg*\n\n\nA: No, apt-add-repository will not handle the GPG keys, so if you want to remove the keys as well, use rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/???.list and then the GPG Keys from /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ \n", "Q: Can't disable lock-screen in Ubuntu Gnome 15.04 I've read through many of the questions on AskUbuntu about disabling the lock-screen.

So if you want to change permanently your time locale from english, to let's say, italian, all you have to do is the following:\nsudo update-locale LC_TIME=it_IT.UTF-8\n\nif an error show up like *** update-locale: Error: invalid locale settings, this means that you don't have that specific locale into your system and you have to generate it with the following command (this one is for french language):\nsudo locale-gen fr_FR.UTF-8\n\nafter that, repeat the first command\nAll you have to do now is to log-out and log-in again\n\nIf you're unclear of which locale to use, by doing cat /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED will list you all available supported locales onto your system\nCheers!\n\nA: One way is to edit the ~/.profile file in your home directory, and add this line:\nexport LC_TIME=en_DK.UTF-8\n\nThat should make the month and weekday names in the calendar be displayed in English next time you log in.\nIt may also change the date and time format in other applications. Depending on you preferences (you didn't say where you live), you may prefer some other English locale.

In order for the nginx to use your configuration, though, you have to place it in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled. Typically this is done using a symbolic link, i.e.:\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/prova.it /etc/nginx/sites-enabled\n\nthen tell nginx to reload the configuration files\nsudo service nginx reload\n\n", "Q: When I open gedit from terminal, I am unable to use terminal for anything else until I close gedit. Why? I am VERY new to the world of Linux.  I'm running Ubuntu 15.04 on a Lenovo laptop.  My terminal emulator is Gnome Terminal.\nI know a few things.  Let's say I type cd Documents/terminalpractice/python_folder.  I then type, for example, touch askubuntu.py.  I then use the command, gedit askubuntu.py.\nAt this point in time the text editor gedit will open up on my screen and I am free to attempt to code as much as I like.  However, in the terminal window, I guess the gedit \"process\" is running?  So I cannot use the terminal until I close out of gedit (I save and then click the 'X' in the top corner).\nWhy does this happen?  I can use the graphical interface to open the folders, double click on my askubuntu.py, and that will open in gedit, without affecting what is going on in the terminal.  I would like to know why  this happens.\n\nA: \nWhy does this happen?\n\nWhen you just run:\n gedit filename\n\nit runs the process in foreground. To send it to the background and continue using terminal, use:\ngedit filename &\n\nNote that this (and of course the one above) will run gedit as a sub-process of your terminal, so when you exit the terminal it will also exit gedit.\nSo to run it 'gracefully', use:\nnohup gedit >/dev/null &\n\nnohup will run gedit detached from terminal and hence it is immune to hangups. >/dev/null redirects the stdout to a special location dev/null, thereby preventing the creation of a nohup.out file.\nSee man nohup and this question for more information.\n\nA: That's normal. If you run a command the terminal doesn't get another command until finished with that one. The way to execute commands as you want is to press ALT + F2 and typing the command you need.\nIf you do it in the terminal it won't accept another command until the instructions of the present command ends.\n\nA: It's because you're launching gedit from the terminal, in the foreground. Any command you run in this way will hog the command prompt until the command has completed. So when you quit the window opened by gedit, your terminal prompt works again.\nYou can run commands in the background by putting & at the end of the command.\nYou can view all background commands that you've launched by using the jobs command.\nYou can also press Ctrl+Z to suspend the command if you've run it normally, you can then send it to the background by typing bg.\n\nA: It's like running a text-mode program or application: it starts running and the terminal (well, not the terminal but the command interpreter) won't be available until the application finishes running. For example, run \"nano\" and you'll see the same behavior (the command interpreter \"steps aside\" while the application runs).\nJust because the application (gedit) opens an additional graphical window doesn't change the underlying, basic behavior.\nWhen you launch a command on the terminal, you can ask the command interpreter to run it in the background by using &:\ngedit blahblah &\n\nIf the command is already running (with the terminal \"locked up\"), you can press ctrl-z (which suspends the currently-running process - note that the gedit window becomes unresponsive), then type bg (which sends the suspended process into the background).\n", "Q: Which fonts can be correctly displayed in GRUB? I just installed grub-customizer, it's pretty cool. It also lets you add a background image and change the font.\nHowever, the fonts always look bad (i.e. it's using a different font or what it thinks is a similar font to the one I've chosen). I tried a couple (including the Ubuntu font and such), but I'd like to avoid trial and error - What fonts are available within the grub and\\or can I expand that somehow so it would look the way I configure it? \nThanks!\n\nA: Although grub-customizer has a \"font\" option and shows the font in its preview, mine (5.1.0 on Ubuntu 18.04) does not actually modify the font setting in grub.cfg.\nI found a blog post that talks about using the grub-mkfont program to generate a font that Grub will use and putting these fonts under /boot/grub/fonts/. The post also says that some fonts don't look good after conversion but doesn't suggest any pattern or way of knowing what's good.\nI ended up getting a theme from Gnome-look and using that (I used Dark Squares) and that included a more attractive font.\n", "Q: Install/Enable Adobe Flash Player debug version in Ubuntu 14.04 for Firefox (if possible for Chrome too) I found many different solutions similar to each other on the web, but obviously they are outdated.

I already have the same .so in  /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer and symlink under mozilla plugins folder referring to this .so. \nIs it possible to enable debug support under Ubuntu 14.04 at least for firefox?\n\nA: Yes sir, debug is possible, but more effectively, you can get adobe flash for Mozilla Firefox in the Ubuntu Software Center.

You can lock and unlock your computer using dbus.\nLock:\ndbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver /org/gnome/ScreenSaver org.gnome.ScreenSaver.Lock\n\nUnlock:\ndbus-send --session --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver --type=method_call --print-reply --reply-timeout=20000 /org/gnome/ScreenSaver org.gnome.ScreenSaver.SetActive boolean:false\n\nIt should unlock without asking for password.\n\nA: In 15.04 the lock screen is implemented in unity.\nIt appears that libpam_usb is not explicitly linked with libpam, as it (falsely) expects that the program using it has libpam already loaded. This is the case for most programs (i.e. sudo, lightdm etc) but not for compiz. A change in the makefile of libpam-usb and recompilation is required to fix it.\nThough as a workaround you can edit /usr/share/applications/compiz.desktop and replace\nExec=compiz\nwith\nExec=/bin/sh -c \"LD_PRELOAD=libpam.so compiz\"\n", "Q: Super slow Internet on Ubuntu 14.04 This has been asked tons of times, that's why I've tried out a couple of solutions and since none of the stuff worked, decided to ask for help here (as a last/desperate resort).\nI own a Dell Inspiron 15R and have been using Ubuntu 14.04 for a couple of weeks.

Forgive me if this post does not contain specific details on this technical problem. This happened a few days ago, and I can't remember every minute detail. Hopefully what is described here is enough for someone to help me solve this problem.\nRecently, I've been having problems with my computer. One day I was downloading a file from a possibly questionable website when my computer locked up. My only option was to power off my computer by holding in the power button. Come to find out when I started my laptop again I was faced with a black screen. After a few minutes that black screen turned to blue with an error message. It was not a “BIOS blue”, i.e. “blue screen of death,” but it looked a lot like the the graphics of the Windows OS. The error read  something like “system 32 folder corrupted.” Now, I'm not one of those computer wizards, but I know enough to tell that is not a good sign. I'm only left to assume that I got a virus, or maybe I just screwed it up with a hard rest. I don't know.\nSo, after all this I just decided to install Ubuntu onto the hard drive instead. This is because I don't have a Windows disk. My computer came with Windows pre-installed.\nI took a USB drive and made it able to boot into Ubuntu. When I booted to Ubuntu for the first time I could see the hard drive broken into four partitions on the Launcher side bar. Each partition had a unique name. The names were something along the lines of OS, Repair, Restore, and something else. I then ran GParted to delete each partition and reformat the hard drive. I think that when I did this I messed something up because when I tried to run the installer I couldn't install it properly. Now every time I boot Ubuntu the hard drive no longer shows up in the Launcher or GParted. I think that this is because it became even more corrupted when I deleted all the partitions.\nI'm not sure what to do at this point. Is there something I can do to fix my hard drive? Is there any software that I can install that can access my hard drive and let me reformat it? Is my hard drive too corrupted to fix? Maybe it's physically damaged?\nAny advice?\nEdit 1:\nSince I did a poor job explaining, here is a picture that shows what exactly I am seeing. As you can see I can only see my USB drive from GParted.\n\nEdit 2:\nI still have yet to find the answer to my question. I think that it is clear that Ubuntu can not recognize the hard drive. If anyone has any applications that I can use that are already on the OS or that can be downloaded so I can fix my hard drive I would be very grateful. Unless of course there is a better way to fix it.\nEdit 3:\nI discovered a command for Linux called \"fsck\". Does this ring a bell to anyone? Can this be used to check the current state of my hard drive? Anyone? Please. Help...\nEdit 4:\nI am grateful for all the answers I've received thus far, but I've realized something. \nWhen asking this question I tried to give as much information as possible. I was afraid that if I did not I would get ignored. This has seemed to distract people from the actual question. I should have asked about hard drive corruption and left out installing Ubuntu all together.\nI have learned a lesson in that it's about asking the right question and not about giving as much information as possible. Making the question more direct consequently makes the answers more direct as well. This was my mistake. I'm going to reform my question to make it more precise. Hopefully I can soon find the right solution.\n\nA: I doubt that there's hardware corruption.  What's happened is that because you've deleted all the partitions, there is no partition to mount.  A partition is kind of like a virtual drive.  It is the interface to the actual ones and zeros, and provides some structure.  It's like you need a body on a car chassis.\nSo just go ahead and run the installer and select the \"Wipe everything and install Ubuntu\" option (or equivalent wording).  It should take care of everything for you.  Keep in mind, since you already deleted Windows, you've got nothing to lose by experimenting.  So use this oportunity to have fun and learn something.  Or just go listen to some heavy metal.  Or go eat a sandwich, see if I care.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you have done so far, I'll assume you have a hard drive that has messed up partitions. \nPlug in the installation disk for Ubuntu, let it boot up. Open the installing menu. Now from here, select manually formatting partitions. There, I need you to select every partition and click on the - sign. \nNow, while choosing a Free space, press on + sign to create a new partition with Ext4 format. Choose about 20 to 30 GB for this partition and set mount point / for it. Also make sure the format sign is clicked.\nCreate another Ext4 partition and mount it as /home, this would be where you put your files in it. I'd put 50 GB for myself, you can choose any other amount that will work for you.\nThat's it. Continuing will ask you for configurations such as user name and timezone. \nGood luck\n", "Q: Wireless Disconnects Intermittently with Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6205 [Taylor Peak] [8086:0085] (rev 34) I am on Ubuntu 15.04 using xfce (xubuntu) and am having trouble with my wi-fi.

I downloaded Ubuntu 15.04 onto a USB stick and followed the instructions as outlined in the Quick Install From USB docs.\nSecure Boot is disabled.\nI can successfully boot into Ubuntu and begin the installation process. Around 80% of the way through I get the fatal error:\nunable to install GRUB in /dev/sda\nI've been through many of the other posts here on this issue, but cannot find a solution that seems to work in my situation. I have tried the 'Try without installing' option, and attempting to install after booting to desktop, but I get the same problem.\nAs far as I can tell, the issue is with the partition that is being attempted to install to.\nUpdate: Boot Info here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/12447125/\nIs anyone able to offer any advice on what might be causing this, or how I should choose/prepare a partition in order to install successfully?\nThanks\n\nA: First, disable Fast Startup in Windows. This feature is a good way to cause filesystem corruption (my nickname for it is \"Fast Filesystem Corruption\"), which in turn can cause any number of problems, including an inability to install GRUB -- precisely the symptom you're seeing.\nAfter you've disabled Fast Startup, you can try running Boot Repair or re-install Ubuntu. With any luck, disabling Fast Startup will enable either of these procedures to work, but I can't make any promises about that.\nIf you disable Fast Startup but can't seem to get GRUB installed, another option is to try my rEFInd boot manager. You can try it risk-free by preparing a USB flash drive or CD-R with the appropriate version (see the downloads page for links). You should then be able to boot from the appropriate medium, which should let you boot either Windows or Ubuntu. If you can boot both OSes, you can install rEFInd via the PPA or Debian package to get it on your hard disk. One big caveat is that if there's filesystem damage that's preventing GRUB from installing, the same problem is likely to affect rEFInd. OTOH, it could be a bug in the GRUB installation script that's not shared by the rEFInd installation script, so rEFInd might work around such problems. If nothing else, using rEFInd on a USB drive or CD-R might be a useful temporary stopgap to get you into your regular Ubuntu installation. From there you'd need to do more detailed analysis to figure out what's causing the boot loader problems, but at least you'd have a way to boot.\n\nA: The solution in my case was to enable the 'Both' option for UEFI/Legacy BIOS boot support, as well as setting the Secure Chip to 'Inactive'. After all previous failed attempts, I made the changes to both these settings at the same time, so it's possible only one of them was required to solve the issue. \n\nA: You are having problems with windows 8.1 secure boot. Try disabling UEFI following this tutorial. And then install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Windows FINDSTR Ubuntu equivalent to search .csv I have a folder (Transactions) with hundreds of .csv files.

Is there any way I can use the button to scroll but disable single click?\nThe usual workaround seems to be to use the \"forward\" button for scrolling, since clicks on that are mostly harmless, but I find having to click that with my ring finger much more awkward than thumbing the back button.\n\nA: I think the option you're looking for is ButtonMapping.  I had a similar annoying feature with my mouse ( https://www.kensington.com/en/no/4493/k72327eu/slimblade-trackball ), so figured this out a while ago. \nThe \"EmulateWheelButton\" option still should work even if you disable the button or reassign the mapping...\nNow, I've only tested this with xinput on evdev.  It's a lot quicker to try things out with xinput and then you could just add a script to your \"Startup Applications\" instead of having to modify /etc/X11/ and restart X over and over.\nSo this should be all you need in xorg.d/mouse.conf (the commented out lines are what should be needed if you don't want to use a login script to do this per user), though you might not need this at all if you use xinput:\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier  \"Configured Mouse\"\n    Driver    \"evdev\"\n    Option    \"Device\"                \"/dev/input/mice\"\n    Option    \"Protocol\"              \"auto\"\n    #Option    \"EmulateWheel\"          \"1\"\n    #Option    \"EmulateWheelButton\"    \"8\"\n    #Option    \"ButtonMapping\"        \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 9 10 11 12\"\nEndSection\n\nHere's what I did to figure out my solution (replace my device with your device in the following commands obviously):\nShow devices:\n$ xinput list\nVirtual core pointer                        id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n  ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                  id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n  ↳ ELAN Touchscreen                            id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n  ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                  id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n  ↳ Kensington Kensington Slimblade Trackball   id=18   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nSee what properties are supported for that device:\n$ xinput list-props \"Kensington Kensington Slimblade Trackball\"\nDevice 'Kensington Kensington Slimblade Trackball':\n    Device Enabled (142):        1\n    Coordinate Transformation Matrix (144):        1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000\n    Device Accel Profile (273):        0\n    Device Accel Constant Deceleration (274):        1.000000\n    Device Accel Adaptive Deceleration (275):        1.000000\n    Device Accel Velocity Scaling (276):        10.000000\n    Device Product ID (260):        1149, 8257\n    Device Node (261):        \"/dev/input/event17\"\n    Evdev Axis Inversion (277):        0, 0\n    Evdev Axes Swap (279):        0\n    Axis Labels (280):        \"Rel X\" (152), \"Rel Y\" (153), \"Rel Vert Wheel\" (573)\n    Button Labels (281):        \"Button Left\" (145), \"Button Middle\" (146), \"Button Right\" (147), \"Button Wheel Up\" (148), \"Button Wheel Down\" (149), \"Button Horiz Wheel Left\" (150), \"Button Horiz Wheel Right\" (151), \"Button Side\" (679), \"Button Unknown\" (263), \"Button Unknown\" (263), \"Button Unknown\" (263), \"Button Unknown\" (263)\n    Evdev Scrolling Distance (282):        1, 1, 1\n    Evdev Middle Button Emulation (283):        0\n    Evdev Middle Button Timeout (284):        50\n    Evdev Third Button Emulation (285):        0\n    Evdev Third Button Emulation Timeout (286):        1000\n    Evdev Third Button Emulation Button (287):        3\n    Evdev Third Button Emulation Threshold (288):        20\n    Evdev Wheel Emulation (289):        1\n    Evdev Wheel Emulation Axes (290):        0, 0, 4, 5\n    Evdev Wheel Emulation Inertia (291):        10\n    Evdev Wheel Emulation Timeout (292):        200\n    Evdev Wheel Emulation Button (293):        8\n    Evdev Drag Lock Buttons (294):        0\n\nNow let's give it a shot:\n$ xinput set-button-map \"Kensington Kensington Slimblade Trackball\" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 9 10 11 12\n$ xinput set-prop \"Kensington Kensington Slimblade Trackball\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation\" 1\n$ xinput set-prop \"Kensington Kensington Slimblade Trackball\" \"Evdev Wheel Emulation Button\" 8\n\nNow my top right button only works as auto-scroll instead of the infuriating back behavior!\n\nA: Here is my configuration for this very good trackball, on Ubuntu, back in 2009.

What I don't like is that the HDD, which has 500GB is not partitioned as I wanted(as expected), so now I have one extra large partition with Ubuntu installed on it, a swap partition and three additional primary partitions made by manufacturer I suppose with boot loader, recovery partition and stuff like that, so right now my hard drive looks like this\nHDD(500GB)\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1(500MB)     - primary, FAT32, label: ESP,   flags: boot\n\n*sda2(40MB)      - primary, FAT32, label: DIAGS, flags: hidden\n\n*sda3(3GB)       - primary, FAT32, label: OS,    flags: msftdata\n\n*sda4(454,41GB)  - primary, ext4,\n\n*sda5(7,82GB)    - logical, linux-swap\n\n\nFirst thing I want to know is are there any reasons why I shouldn't erase everything from HDD? I don't know are any of first three partitions required for my lap top to work properly, although I suppose that while reinstalling Ubuntu all that is needed will be created and I really don't think I need a recovery partition as Ubuntu is free to download and use. I don't see the problem with starting from scratch, but as I said I am new to Ubuntu so better safe then sorry right?\nHere is what I want. I want to have a dual boot system with Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7, but I don't want to install Windows right now. I just want to prepare the HDD partitions so I can reinstall Ubuntu(yes I want to reinstall it actually, so keep in mind that all partitioning will be done while installing Ubuntu) and leave partition for Windows to be installed in the future. Here is the partition scheme that I came up with and which I'd like some of more experienced users to evaluate.\nHDD(500GB)\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1(150GB) - primary, FAT32, Mount point: none, for Windows\n\n*sda2(30GB)  - primary, ext4,  Mount point: /\n\n*sda5(120GB) - logical, ext4,  Mount point: /home\n\n*sda6(195GB) - logical, FAT32, Mount point: none, for data for both\n\n*sda7(5GB)   - logical, swap\n\n\nDevice for boot loader installation: /dev/sda\nSo here are my questions\n1.Should I maybe create another partition(if yes which primary or logical) for boot installation, and how big should it be, or will it be taken care of with this setting? I saw it got 500MB, but only used around 30MB.\n2.As I saw I cannot create partition as a NTFS, so I assume I'll have to change FAT32 partitions to NTFS later, perhaps when I install Windows. This is more of an observation then a question really but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.\n3.Are partition sizes OK or should I allocate memory in some other way?\n\nA: IIRC The only issues Ive ever had with dell laptop hard drives was that their recovery software expected the original drive to be in the machine. For factory restoring the machine it had to be a specific size. \nIf your machine is using an SSD it may be worth your while to manually partition it with GPT and align your partitions to get a little more speed out of your rig. There are plenty of guides out there for doing that.\n1: I think most people create a 500MB boot one these days. IDFK why its just done.. for grub and stuff right?\n2: If its an SSD I would leave the windows one as free space for now. Many SSD makers these days automatically use free unpartitioned space as overprovisioning space which improves the drives performance and lifespan. Let windows install to the free space when you go to install it imo.\n3: Yes that all looks very nice :). If you are using a spinning disk I would probably tweak the locations slightly so that all the most used data (sda5?) is on the outer edge of the disk to allow for a slightly higher read/write speed. I would also put sda6 between the ubuntu and windows partitions to lower the seek times and put the swap (sda7) right after the most heavily used partition for the same reason.\n\nA: First, be aware that if you bought a computer with Ubuntu pre-installed on it, the Ubuntu you're running may be customized with special drivers. Thus, re-installing Ubuntu on it might or might not work as well as what you've got now. You should ask the manufacturer, or at least check the PPAs you've got (look for files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d) and be prepared to restore them.\nAnother point is that it appears your computer is currently booting in EFI mode. Your first partition is an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is required to boot in that way. Pretty much all modern computers use EFI firmware natively, and support BIOS/legacy-mode booting via something called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which is a sort of BIOS emulator that runs atop the EFI, sort of like dosemu enables Linux to run DOS programs. If you completely re-do your system, you'll need to decide whether to use BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode or EFI/UEFI-mode booting. The former may be more familiar, but adds complexity to the boot process (see this page of mine for more on this subject). EFI/UEFI mode is the computer's native mode, and it offers some advantages, but it's new, it's got a learning curve attached, and there are still more EFI-mode bugs than BIOS-mode bugs.\nAlso, be aware that it's best, by a wide margin, to boot both OSes in the same mode. Windows ties its boot mode to its partition table type -- BIOS to MBR and EFI to GPT. Thus, your boot mode determines the partition table type (or vice-versa, depending on your priorities). Given the fact that Microsoft has let Windows' support for extended and logical partitions languish, I'd have to recommend against using MBR with extended and logical partitions; the odds of the Windows installer or some future tool doing serious damage to the setup is just too great. (OTOH, lots of people do run such setups, and if you minimize your use of Windows partitioning tools, you may be able to get away with it. I'm concerned in your case, though, because you want to install Windows after installing Linux, so the Windows installer may try to adjust your partition table, whether you ask it to or not.)\nFor more on EFI-mode installations, check out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog post on how EFI-mode booting works. This is useful theory and background information.\n\n*My page on doing EFI-mode installs of Linux. This moves to more practical tips on how to get it done, but it's not a step-by-step tutorial.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki's page on doing EFI-mode installs of Ubuntu. This is a bit chaotic and poorly written at points, but it provides specific procedures for doing an Ubuntu install in EFI mode.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu freezes when starting virtualbox I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and Virtual box version 4.3.10_Ubuntu r93012.

The 1000 supported printers is a little bit short since Linux supports A LOT more.\nThe steps to get your printer working in 99% of the cases is (Follow the instructions precisely to the point. Step by step without jumping any steps):\nStep 1 - Turn Printer ON (If not already done)\nStep 2 - Connect Printer cable to Printer (If not already done)\nStep 3 - Connect other end of Printer cable to Computer with Ubuntu\nStep 4 - Enjoy! ;)\nNOTE - In the case your printer is not automatically found and configured go to System Settings -> Printers and click on the Add button to look for it manually. This method supports USB and Network printers on the same LAN. It also supports looking for the correct drivers for the printer, downloading them and basic configuration in the moment of installation.\nI can show you a small percent of supported printers here:\nhttp://www.cups.org/ppd.php\nbut this list is out-of-date and needs some serious refresh since many of the ones I use are not listed there.\nAnother great source is http://www.openprinting.org/printers which lets you quickly look in a LONGGGGG list of printers. I recommend searching by the manufaturer and then the model because trying to look for list of the manufacturer (second option below) will take a long time and since I am saying there are a lot of printers already literally plug n' play for linux then the list will be huge. I tried HP and lost count.\nIf this is not enough HP offers a one click software for Ubuntu to support a little over 2000+ HP printers here: http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html. Note that many of them are already supported but you will get enhance support like Ink Level notices and better control for the printer for specific stuff for it.\nYou can even find from companies like HP, Epson an Canon an option to actually install the needed drivers from their sites. When you try to install some of the printers from this guys, if the driver is not on your Ubuntu version, you will get an option to download and install it. A case is the Epson L555 which downloads from Epson and supports Wireless printing, Wireless scanning and finding the printer on the LAN.\nUPDATE - Added site list to search for the 2000+ HP printers easier: http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/supported_devices/index.html\nCopied from Luis Alvarado \nSource : How do I install my printer with Ubuntu?\n", "Q: How to check how long specific entry in arp table will stay and when it'll be expired?

WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly.

Unfortunately, this varies a lot from one computer to another. Typically, hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key early in the boot process does the trick -- but sometimes the time window for doing so is quite narrow, so you may end up having to try two or three times before it succeeds. Asking on a forum dedicated to your manufacturer may get you a more specific answer.\nOnce you can boot from an external medium your options will open up. You can often use Boot Repair from a live disk to get GRUB back to a working state. Alternatively, my own rEFInd boot manager may be useful -- put it on a USB flash drive or CD-R and it should enable you to boot Windows or Linux, even if GRUB is completely messed up.\nAs a last resort, removing the hard disk and booting without it will often put you into the firmware setup utility, but of course you won't be able to do anything to your OS that way. You might use this to alter the boot options to enable you to use a keypress to enter the EFI's built-in boot manager, though. (Sometimes this option can be disabled or its window of operation narrowed to an unusable level, so adjusting such details can be helpful. \"Fast start\" options can be to blame for this.) That said, removing or replacing the disk sometimes has the undesirable side effect of removing entries from the EFI's boot manager, which stores data in NVRAM. When the EFI notices that entries point to a disk that's no longer available, the firmware sometimes \"helpfully\" deletes them, which is obviously not what you want in this case.\nYou may be able to adjust your OS by moving the disk to another computer that can boot another Linux installation (even the Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode). You'll need to know what you're doing, though, and if you try to adjust the boot process, a slip-up can end up affecting the second computer's main installation, so be careful if you do this!\n", "Q: Unable to install busybox-initramfs 15.04 I am trying to install ubuntu 15.04 server on a machine.\nDuring installation is stopped installing with the following error: An error was returned while trying to install the busybox-initramfs package onto the target system.\nUbuntu 15.04 desktop installs fine, but not server.\n\nA: I have had the same issue on Ubuntu Server 14.04 i386 and did this to solve it.\n/boot partition separate, outside of root partition, formated with ext3(with error it was ext4)\nAfter that, the installation succeeded.\n\nA: I just came across the same issue with 14.04.

How can I change Ubuntu server IP Address to the web address? For example, the address that I need to access on the browser is 192.168.x.xxx. How can I change to dev.robi.local? Thanks!\nThe /etc/hosts file:\n127.0.0.1 localhost localhost\n192.168.0.105 dev.robi.local robi\n::1 localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\nThe resolv.conf file:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\ndomain dev.robi.local\nsearch dev.robi.local\n\n\nA: Conventionally name resolution, that is the mapping of IP addresses to host names and vice versa, is done by a DNS (Domain Name System) server.\nYou probably have an internet router that provides DNS for your local network. There is an offside chance, that your router allows you to add entries to its DNS, but usually customer grade hardware does not offer this. Won't hurt to check, since this would be the easiest way.\nAs this will probably not be possible, there are multiple ways to go\nNote: the domain .local refers to a system known as m(ulticast)DNS, aka zeroconf/bonjour/avahi - for technical details see the RFC. It provides name resolution and service announcement if there is no dedicated DNS server available, although on OS X(bonjour) and Ubuntu (avahi) it is enabled by default.\nUpdate: I found the avahi method not immediately viable and setting up a local DNS only makes sense if it can run as the primary DNS for the network.\n\n*\n\n*Most operating systems maintain a hosts file, which contains entries like IP hostname. You could manually add an entry (replace x's with the proper IP!)\n  192.168.x.x dev.robi\n\nto /etc/hosts on each client on the LAN. This method is straightforward, but a little impractical, if IPs or hostnames change frequently.\n\n*\n\n*As noted above, the avahi-daemon is running by default on Ubuntu. You can configure the machine to announce itself under multiple names, but there needs to be a mDNS client running on each machine in the LAN, that should resolve the new hostname (on Windows machines, Apples bonjour service is installed with iTunes).\nGive it a try by adding\n  192.168.x.x dev.robi.local\n\nto /etc/avahi/hosts and restart the service with sudo service avahi-daemon restart. Now try if the new hostname is resolved e.g. by pinging it from another machine.\nUpdate: The described method to use avahi to setup an alias does not work! Avahi will not allow to bind multiple hostnames to the same IP, as it will always try to register a corresponding PTR, which leads to a collision. This is expected and good behavior.\nHowever, there exists an extension avahi-alias which allows to register aliases (CNAME). Unfortunately, those aliases will not be recognized by (at least) Windows clients, but as long as you're only running clients with avahi, this provides a real option.\nTo install avahi on a Ubuntu system, do\n    sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon libnss-mdns \n\n\n*\n\n*Setup a local DNS server. I would recommend dnsmasq. It can be installed with sudo apt-get install dnsmasq. It comes with a DHCP server which you will want to disable. Its config is stored in /etc/dnsmasq.conf. To disable DHCP set\n  no-dhcp-interface=eth0\n\nwhere eth0 is the interface connecting to the LAN.\ndnsmasq automatically reads /etc/hosts, so add your hostname to hosts like stated above. Finally add the machine running dnsmasq to the list of DNS servers on each client.\nUpdate: You probably have a DNS server running already, e.g on your internet router. The clients will send DNS queries to that server. You cannot simply add a secondary DNS to your clients config, as it will only ever be queried if the primary DNS is unreachable. Unless you're running an always-on machine that can become the primary DNS for the network, there is no way to make this work.\nIn Summary: In a Linux-only environment, where you can run the avahi-daemon on each client, the avahi method actually provides a solution. I tried this myself.\nSince you probably cannot turn a machine into an always-on DNS server, installing and configuring dnsmasq is not advised.\nStill, the most straightforward if a little cumbersome method, is to add an entry to the hosts file on each client!\nYour recent problem with DNS resolution probably comes from running dnsmasq. I now actually discourage using dnsmasq, since it will not solve your problem. Stop the service sudo service dnsmasq stop. Then try host -v ro.archive.ubuntu.com. It should resolve using Google's DNS 8.8.8.8 as configured in resolv.conf.\nFurthermore, if you go with the hosts method, do not append the domain .local, as it is reserved for mDNS. Instead, just put\n192.168.0.5 dev.robi\n\nin /etc/hosts, not dev.robi.local.\n", "Q: Install OpenGL 4.0+ in Ubuntu 14.04 running by a VM I tried to build a project using Qt 5.0 and OpenGL 4.0+.

Most of the modern browsers support that by now. So I generated a certificate with StartSSL. Everything but Nignx 1.8.0-1+trusty1 comes from the official repositories.

On my Ubuntu 15.04 (Linux Kernel 3.19.0-28-generic) I get the same value when requesting CLOCK_TAI and CLOCK_REALTIME with clock_gettime(). This is apparently an error because the difference between CLOCK_TAI and CLOCK_REALTIME should be the number of leap seconds plus the epoch difference considering this article about the RedHat OS.  \n\nA: CLOCK_TAI is basically designed as CLOCK_REALTIME(UTC) + tai_offset.  \n\nSo the usec/nsec portion of a timeval/timespec should be identical.\nCLOCK_MONOTONIC: Zeroed at boot.  \n\nCLOCK_TAI = CLOCK_MONOTONIC + tai_mon_offset    \n\nCLOCK_REALTIME(UTC) = CLOCK_TAI - tai_utc_offset  \n\nBut due to performance concern (CLOCK_REALTIME is what applications\nhammer the most), in Linux we actually structure it as:\nCLOCK_REALTIME: Initialized at boot from RTC  \nCLOCK_MONOTONIC: CLOCK_REALTIME - wall_to_monotonic  \nCLOCK_TAI: CLOCK_REALTIME + tai_offset\n\nSo CLOCK_REALTIME and CLOCK_TAI return the same because the kernel parameter tai_offset is zero.\nCheck by using adjtimex(timex tmx) and read the value. I think that ntpd will set it if it is new enough (>4.2.6) and has a leap second file. It may also be able to get it from upstream servers but I haven't been able to verify. The call adjtimex() can set tai_offset manually when run as root.\nMy references here and here\n\nA: The answer was found inside the referred article. Emphasis is by me.\n\nFor applications where it would be possible to work with TAI time instead of UTC, the kernel provides a special CLOCK_TAI clock which does include leap seconds and doesn’t need to be corrected after leap second, avoiding the problem with backward jump in the time entirely. It’s implemented as a clock running at a fixed integral offset to CLOCK_REALTIME, which is atomically incremented by 1 when the CLOCK_REALTIME clock is stepped back on leap second. It was introduced in the Linux kernel version 3.10 and is available with the kernels shipped in RHEL7. Please note that the offset from CLOCK_REALTIME is initialized on boot to zero and neither ntpd nor chronyd set it by default to the correct value (currently 35). Switching to CLOCK_TAI in applications would of course require modifications to the code and possibly also all protocols that use the Unix representation of time.\n\n", "Q: Wifi P2P wpa_supplicant - failed to create p2p device interface I'm trying to configure wifi p2p connection with ubuntu, but I have some issues. \n In particular I followed this guide and this one\nAlmost everything seems ok, but when I lunch the command:\nsudo ./wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c /etc/p2p.conf -Dnl80211 -ddt\n\nI get this error:\n     1442591346.069280: nl80211: Set wlan0 operstate 0->0 (DORMANT)\n     1442591346.069563: netlink: Operstate: ifindex=4 linkmode=-1 (no change), operstate=5 (IF_OPER_DORMANT)\n     1442591346.069901: nl80211: Create interface iftype 10 (P2P_DEVICE)\n     1442591347.591372: Failed to create interface p2p-dev-wlan0: -5 (Input/output error)\n     1442591347.592233: nl80211: Failed to create a P2P Device interface p2p-dev-wlan0\n     1442591347.593031: P2P: Failed to create P2P Device interface\n     1442591347.593754: P2P: Failed to enable P2P Device interface\n     1442591347.594689: EAPOL: disable timer tick\n     1442591347.595501: random: Got 20/20 bytes from /dev/random\n\nAfter that, if I open anyway another shell and I type \nsudo ./wpa_cli -i wlan0\n\nthe session seems to start correctly, but when I try to use p2p commands, they fail:\n     wpa_cli v2.4\n     Copyright (c) 2004-2015, Jouni Malinen <j@w1.fi> and contributors\n     This software may be distributed under the terms of the BSD license.\n     See README for more details.\n     Interactive mode\n     > p2p_find\n     FAIL\n\nSomeone can help me?

I was able to remove the echoes of the Windows install which the machine came with, so it is no longer even thinking about being dual-boot but it still has the described behaviour.\n\n*Therefore, there appears to be a problem with EFI and suspend interfering with each other in Ubuntu on the Lenovo G50-45.

No EFI evident in the OS, (no /sys/firmware/efi/ was present) but this behaviour persisted.

I've read many questions but I don’t really know what to do. Probably because I am really new at this type of stuff. Also forgot to say.

Anyways the ubuntu 15 installer worked just fine and it could dual boot and create a partition without any problems.  \nRegards, Bablooo\n\nA: If you boot back in Windows and delete the partition you created for Linux that should solve your problem. Linux typically operates on an ext3 or ext4 file system that isn't supported in Windows. It's best to therefore leave some empty unpartitioned space on your hard drive and Linux will create a partition itself for you when you install it.\n\nA: \nThis answer is from the OP, and taken from an edit to their question.

Compiz? Sometimes the mouse pointer is nice and agile, and sometimes it slows down tremendously or sticks, taking a big sweeping motion just to get it the last centimeter so it passes over a field or button where i want it.  Sometimes it decided i've clicked when i haven't, other times i have to click 2 or 3 times. \nThe mouse is wireless and its batteries are good. I've tried with a different mouse but the problem persists. I also have a Wacom Bamboo tablet and i switch back and forth, partially just to try to keep working when it is annoying me this way. The tablet doesn't display this behaviour, only the mouse. I tried unplugging the tablet to see if it would help, it makes no difference. \nThe system is brand new and it is also a fresh install of 64-bit 14.04. This behaviour has happened with every install of Ubuntu, and also happened on my old system, which shared no components with this one other than the tablet and the hard drives. So I presume this has to do with the tablet. It is a Bamboo Capture Pen & Touch, CTH-470. I am a novice to Linux, I'm afraid. How should I go about fixing this?\nEdit: After looking around a bit, in this answer it talked about using System Monitor to find out what is using CPU resources. This answer talked about compiz causing mouse lag. So I opened the system monitor, found compiz, and am checking what %CPU it is taking. I just moved the browser window and it jumped to 18%. As I'm typing it is fluctuating between 2 and 5%. I have a lot of browser tabs open right now, and a window with Blender in the background, partly in an effort to load up the system and find the issue. Just moving the mouse around is causing Compiz to spike at 6 to 8%. \nAlso, at the bottom of the comments on this question, the asker mentions that moving the mouse to a 'super USB', which I took to be a USB 3.0 port, their mouse issues ceased. I have also done that. For a while that seemed to help, but now the mouse is once again sticking and jumping. There seems to be a correlation to how long the computer has been on, and how bad it is, and also it seems to get worse over or near buttons and fields. But then it works fine again for a while. \nMy system has a Haswell i7, 16 GB RAM and a GeForce GTX 960. It's built for graphics work, which makes this problem that much more annoying.\nOutput of lspci -k | grep -EA2 'VGA|3d' is\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 1401 (rev a1)\n    Subsystem: eVga.com.

I have an Alienware laptop with a 750GB HDD and a 32GB SSD-cache.\nI currently have a Windows 10 partition that I only use for maintaining the SSD-cache and drivers. The laptop is useless for gaming due to hardware issues (which Dell refuses to acknowledge) and I find Windows 10 useless for work.\nI would like to know if I install the Ubuntu root partition on the SSD and home & swap on the HDD, will it run faster than the current cache configuration?\nIf it's faster, I will do it that way. Anything I should know about partitioning when I have a setup like that, or are the partitioning rules of thumb the same?\n\nA: Yes, running Ubuntu solely on an SSD would be the option with the most performance. You could even consider partitioning the SSD further to contain both your OS partition as well as the swap space. Putting the swap space on the HDD places somewhat of a bottleneck in performance if you begin to use memory-intensive applications that exceed the RAM space you have, as your speed will be limited by the read/write speed of the HDD. Because SDDs can read and write data much faster, having the swap space there will undoubtedly increase your performance.\n", "Q: Greping text file I have text file:\nLine1 aaa\nLine2 aaa\nLine3 aaa\nLine4 importan info about Linux\nLine5 infoA\nLine6 infoB\nLine7\n\nI would like to display line containing word \"Linux\" and two lines more.\nRegarding first part is clear:\ncat textfile.txt |grep Linux\n\nBut how to display two lines more?\n\nA: Use the -A option of grep:\ncat textfile.txt | grep -A2 Linux\n\nor without the cat:\ngrep -A2 Linux textfile.txt\n\n\nA: Awk alternative approach \n$ awk '/Linux/ {print $0; for (i=1;i<=2;i++){ getline; print $0 } }' test-text-file.txt                               \nLine4 importan info about Linux\nLine5 infoA\nLine6 infoB\n\nOr as Pilot6 suggested in the coments, you can do \nawk '/Linux/{x=NR+2}(NR<=x)' test-text-file.txt\n", "Q: How can I install Itop on ubuntu Recently I tried to install ITop on my xubuntu but all of my tries were unsuccessful.

I did a 4 partitions. At first I installed Ubuntu with 2 partitions, / and /home. After that, I rebooted and installed the Fedora22, just / (root) because I was interested to share the same /home for all distributions. I noticed my Fedora22 wasn't using the same /home that Ubuntu, but created a /home into the partition which I mount just fedora root.\nI've deleted everything from my HD and start it over, now 3 partitions, 90Gb for future use, 50 for ubuntu's root and 350 for /home. Now I'm not sure about if the /home where I'm saving my files is either the /home partition of my installation process or another /home created into root partition. How can I know that?\nPS.: now I have just Ubuntu, maybe my explanation have been a little confuse. I don't intend to use windows at all, but I'd like to taste others Linux distributions.\n\nA: It MIGHT be possible to set up as you wish, you will need 3 partitions (/- ubuntu, /-fedora, /home,) plus swap space, usually an additional partition that also could be used for both distros.\n  When doing the install of the 1st OS, select manually creating of partitions.\nset up your / for this install and the /home partition and swap space. Record the device ID for both /home and swap (ex: /home=/dev/sda# and swap also= /dev/sda#).\nwhen this install finishes, go to a boot and look system over to see if good install. Then, boot from next distro DVD and choose install, ALSO choose manually creating partitions for this install. Set up the / for this second distro and use the previously defined /home and swap partitions for this distro as well. This should allow /home and swap to be used for both distros.\nSome other things to consider: use the same fstype for both distros. You may also want to be certain that both distros are using the same boot loader (GRUB?).\n    Hope this helps, Craig\n\nA: I'm not sure what you're asking, but here goes:  \nThere are several versions of Disk Truth, kept in different places.  \nThere is the On-Disk Disk Truth, where every disk keeps a pointer in its Master Boot Record (or UEFI's GPT) to a table that describes the start and end and \"type\" of each partition on the disk. This can be temporarily \"obsolete\" if some O/S or software has made changes and not yet written them back.\nMany partitions (but not all) have a \"boot sector\" which kicks off loading the Operating system from that partition. See man -k grub. grub has its version of Disk Truth that it uses to find and boot the selected O/S.\nIn each booted Operating System's /etc/fstab is that system's description of Disk Truth, telling that particular system which disk and which partition to mount where (man mount;man fstab). \nAn Operating System booted from a different partition would, of course, have a different /etc/fstab, with its own idea of what to mount where.\nUse the \"Custom Install\" option of each distribution (yes, I know it's scary, but you asked for it), and tell it where your /home partition is (actually, tell it to mount your Home partition on its /home), and, especially tell it NOT to format the partition.\nWhen setting up your /home partition, pick a partition \"type\" that is supported by all your installation candidates. \nWARNING Altering a partition in any way, while it's mounted by an Operating System leads to Disaster \n\nA: Sorry for bother you, but I solved by a really really dummy way. I click on my personal files on desktop (I use ubuntu MATE) and went to System directory and right button clicked to view the free space in /home directory. As I saw almost 350Gb (the partition size) I concluded the /home (directory) is in the /home (partition) instead root.\nThank you for the answers and sorry for the waste time.\n", "Q: Can't adjust sound for internal sound card anymore Weird problem just appeared.

I've got a headless Ubuntu box that I'm using as a router+switch+WAP.

I don't have a clue why it has become the default for all unknown file types. It should only be associated with .psafe3 file extensions.\nHow can I change or reset the default for unknown file types?\nI'm using Firefox 40.0.3 under Ubuntu 14.04 and GNOME Shell 3.10.4.\n\nA: Firefox used the application defined in \n~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\nfor type application/octet-stream under [Default Applications].\nIn my case it was like this :\n[Default Applications]\napplication/octet-stream=geany.desktop\n\nYou can set it to another application.

I clicked on something that downloaded this malware using my Opera browser - then clicked on the file from the browser (by accident I was intending to open the folder) and got a message along the lines \"couldn't be unpacked.\"  I then opened the containing folder and deleted it.  All in Ubuntu 14.04 - I take it my system hasn't been compromised as 1. it's Windows Malware, 2. it didn't even unpack and 3. I never entered my my sudo password.  Apologies for my density on this but my nerves are frayed from 1001 other things today too. \n\nA: I don't like to give out breezy assurances about not worrying about malware. Malware is getting stealthier and nastier all the time. If so many big websites have been hacked, is there any reason to believe that an ordinary user can't get hacked too?\nYou shouldn't search for junk to download in Opera. If I were you I'd uninstall it. I don't think it's a good idea to look for junk to download in Firefox either. QupZilla from the Ubuntu Software Center is a better web browser for this purpose. QupZilla is fast, it can import bookmarks from Firefox, it has AdBlock installed by default, and it keeps the junk out of the way of your most frequently used web browser.\nQupZilla has renamed itself as Falkon and be installed by the following command in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu:\nsudo snap install falkon  \n\n\nA: \n  \n*\n  \n*it's Windows Malware,\n  \n*it didn't even unpack and\n  \n*I never entered my my sudo password.\n  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have Wine installed then your system has a layer of compatibility to Windows, that includes compatibility to malware of some degree. Having Mono installed can be a similar risk, as it can run (some) exe-files too. \n\n*Watch these messages closely: Who or which process or application gave that error message. Some strategies of malware authors include to give you such error messages leaving the impression that it failed while the malware installed and is running properly in the background.\n\n*Malware does not necessarily require administrative access. Currently popular patterns like encrypting your important files and asking for ransom is such an example.\n\n\nAnother questions is how did it even execute? Typical browsers prevent you from drive by downloads and instantly executing them. So who did ran this program? You? Rule of thumb: Never download, install or run something you weren't looking for.\nApparmor is a security solution built into Ubuntu that confines application access. It ships rules for Firefox but as far as I can remember it's focus is to protect the system (otherwise users would complain about being nagged). I don't know about if Opera integrates with Apparmor and how it protects you against drive by downloads, but if the download was executed then that's already one step too far and your criteria to judge are very unsafe. Being even more cautious also not desirable to backup your important data now, because you might contaminate your backups and fresh system installtions in the future.\nIf you haven't been consciously running data forensics software to monitor what exactly this application did then it's not safe to make any judgment. You should not use this system anymore and you should change your habits if somehow there is the possibility that you triggered the execution of the program.\n\nA: It looks like wine is not installed. You tried to open exe by Archive Manager. So nothing bad has happened.\nJust remove that file and forget.\nWindows malware can't affect Linux directly.\n", "Q: Search command in history from drop down list Search in command line history using Ctrl+S or Ctrl+R is nice, but it shows only one line.

There are many utilities available in Ubuntu which will scan your hard disk partitions for deleted files and restore them. Such a list is available here. I have one particular program called Photorec in mind. It comes bundled with a package called \n    testdisk\nFor more instructions in installing Photorec, please go through this link.\nBe sure to select .tex file extension in photorec and proceed further.\n\nA: I have used testdisk to recover(ext partition 4). 14.04 files means it recovered files deleted after 10th July(14.04). It didn't recover files in 13.04(before 10th July). My required  folder was in 13.04 and it had .tex files and .c files.

I may need to recreate partition table (GPT or MBR). \nCan I run Ubuntu Live CD from BIOS to create GPT partitions?\nEdit:\nI yesterday have bought new external drive, done a copy of the whole drive with dd and now i mounted my partition image with losetup. So I don't need answer to my question.\nYou say that similar questions like this are answers to my problem:\nProblem is similar, but they don't answer my question.\nI think that only changes outside ext4 and swap partitions should be MBR (for partition table) and maybe extended partition but it would be very risky.\nIf nobody will write an answer to my question than I will accept answer from Jason M as helping.\nSorry for grammar errors.\n\nA: I think, first you should create a image on a external HD of your whole disk using dd, and after that you can try to recover your data from that image. any change of partition map can affect data loss.\nhope this helps\nJason\n", "Q: Totem & VLC not working Totem (or \"Videos\") & VLC media player is not working, they both refuse to play any videos of any format i tried.

My Internet sometimes gets very slow and unusable and sometimes is super-fast, sometimes intermediate.\nMaybe someone is monitoring me and uploading my data or hacking my WiFi network, since I used an infected Windows platform to burn the Ubuntu DVD. \nHow can I fully check I'm virus-free?\n\nA: In my opinion, there's no possible way the image of Ubuntu you downloaded from the internet could have been modified by a compromised Windows installation in such a way that by booting it your actions on the running system could be tracked (unless you downloaded a fishy Ubuntu image in first place); how specific the malicious software running on the Windows installation should have been to do such a thing?\nIn any case, you can check whether your Ubuntu DVD is exactly how it's meant to be by running md5sum /dev/sr0 and by comparing the output value with the MD5 sum of the original image found here (sr0 might vary based on your configuration if you have more than one drive; you may check the full list of DVD drives by running lsblk);\nYou can check whether someone is \"hacking\" your wireless network by looking at the list of the connected hosts in the router's settings, as most routers provide such a list; if the only IP addresses showing up are from known hosts, such as your PC, then no one is \"hacking\" your wireless network;\nTl;dr\nYour connection is probably slow for other reasons; I'd rule out an hardware problem  because in that case the slowness would probably be persistent rather than intermittent like you're describing:\n\n*\n\n*when using the internet, make sure that you're close enough to the router; avoid using the wifi in places which require the signal to go through bearing walls; in my experience, even adverse atmospheric conditions may play a role, e.g. if the signal has to go through the rain;\n\n\n*other than that, it's probably your ISP's fault, which might be arbitrarily reducing the speed of the connection during certain time slots, or simply sometimes the traffic at the ISP's central to is too huge that the central can't handle it, resulting in the slow speed.\n", "Q: How to remove memtest86 menu entries from Grub 2 How to hide/remove memtest86 menu entries from Grub2.

Usually, you would use sudo for this, but as it's broken, we have to use pkexec as replacement to repair it:\npkexec chmod u+s,g-x /usr/bin/sudo\n\nNow everything should be fixed again. Try the e.g. following command to check:\nsudo echo \"sudo works again! Yay! :D\"\n\nMore complex fix, if you have also messed up pkexec:\nFirst, you need to boot your Ubuntu system in recovery mode. \nYou do this by rebooting and waiting for the GRUB menu to show up. This happens immediately after the BIOS finished its work and before Ubuntu starts to load. It will usually show up if you dual-boot with another OS, but if it does not, you have to hold the Shift key to let it appear. Select the menu point Advanced options and then chose the latest kernel version with the suffix (recovery mode). You will see another menu, where you have to select root, which shows you a terminal with root access.\nMore information on how to enter a root shell in recovery mode can be found here, please follow steps 1-7, then continue here.\nRun the following commands in the root shell:\nmount -o remount,rw /\nchmod u=rwxs,g=rx,o=rx /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pkexec\nexit\n\nThen reboot normally and test your commands.\n\nA: Recently had the same problem, i messed up sudo and pkexec.\nTried @Byte Commander♦ answear above but that didn't work for me because it didn't change the permissions on 2 specific files so i had to change them one at a time.\nThe first file is sudoers which is in /etc\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /etc\n\n*chmod u=rwxs,g=rx,o=rx sudoers\nThe second file is README which is in /etc/sudoers.d\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /sudoers.d\n\n*chmod u=rwxs,g=rx,o=rx README\nAfter you have done these changes try sudo echo \"sudo works again!

Depending on whether you already installed Ubuntu or are about to install it, the steps are different. I'll help you with both, just write a comment to this answer.\nHowever, I want to tell you that you probably will be happier with having your programs on the SSD and instead putting your home folder onto the HDD. Your programs need to read information from there when they start and operate. And I'm guessing that you want your applications to start quickly and to operate fast.\n\nSo you got your ext4 partition on your HDD. Now boot a live system.\nI recommend backing your entire SSD up to an external HDD. To do this (in the live session) make sure no partition of your SSD is mounted: Open GParted and make sure there aren't any lock symbols. If there is a swap-partition, just right-click it and choose \"swap off\". For everything else: Right-click it and choose \"unmount\".\nThen open Nautilus and navigate to your destination on the HDD. When you are there, press Ctrl+L and copy the path. Then type in sudo su into a terminal and execute this command:\ndd if=/dev/sda bs=8M | gzip -9 > \"[the path you copied]/image.gz\"\n\nAssuming /dev/sda is your SSD, otherwise change it. GParted will help you to figure out which one it is.\nThis will take some time since your entire SSD has to be copied. If you have a slow CPU, change -9 to -3.\nDo not mount any partitions on your SSD while this command runs. This would render your backup useless.\nWhen it's done and the numbers for in and out match, you successfully created a backup. You can now proceed in you actual edeavor.\n\nMake sure GParted is closed by now. Open Nautilus and go to your system partition on the SSD, press Ctrl + L, copy the path, I'll call it [systemPath]. Do the same thing with the partition on your HDD, I'll call this path [targetPath]. Make sure there is nothing on the partiton on the HDD except for the folder \"lost+found\" (press Ctrl + H to show hidden files). Open a terminal and enter this command:\nsudo cp -p -R \"[systemPath]/usr/*\" \"[targetPath]\"\n\nIf this command shows any errors, DO NOT PROCEED. Nothing is lost if it fails and you'll be able to use your system just as you used to. (Plus, you made a solid backup which is always a nice thing to have.) Post the errors here if there are any. Otherwise continue.\nOpen GParted again and right-click on the partition of your HDD. Choose \"Information. There is a field called \"UUID\". You need this string. Copy it to GEdit and then close GParted so you can mount partitions with Nautilus.\nOpen Nautilus and go to your system partition on the SSD, press Ctrl + L, copy the path. Then open a terminal and enter this:\nsudo gedit \"[systemPath]/etc/fstab\"\n\nGEdit will open and show you a file. Enter this line immediately after the line which says / after the UUID (where this line says /usr) (The UUIDs have to be different. If they are the same, you copied the wrong one.):\nUUID=c368e545-6d5d-3cc3-b9da-8e3fe347930d /usr               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\nwhere you substitude the UUID with the one you copied from GParted.\n\nA: Many  programs are stored in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin or /bin. Due to this fact I have two solutions:\nFirstly you can copy your complete /usr folder to the HDD and rename the old one to /usr_old or something. Then you can create a new usrdirectory.\nmkdir /usr\n\nNow you can unmount your HDD from the old mountpoint and mount it as the new /usr directory.\nmount <device> /bin\n\nDon't forget to edit fstab in order to make the changes permanent.\nWith the /bin directory you can proceed identically.\nMatter, that the complete folder is now on your HDD and therefore programs, which belong to the OS, too. So if you notice some performance-decreases in some programs I'd copy it back to the SSD and combine this method with the second one.\n\nThe other solution, if you don't want to change the current mountpoint etc. is creating symlinks for the directories above. Copy them onto your HDD and create a symlink in the old place. Vice versa you can proceed for programs which you want to keep on the SSD.\n", "Q: Update GNU GRUB I just have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a partition on which I previously had Ubuntu 12.04.\nWhen I restarted the laptop, the GRUB dual boot menu hasn't updated I among the OS's I have it still shows the Ubuntu 12.04 OS but not the Ubuntu 14.04.\nAny idea on how to solve this?\n\nA: Boot into either Ubuntu and run\nsudo update-grub \n\nThat should generate a new grub config file with your newly installed OS. It should appear next time you reboot. \nIf it doesn't, run this as well:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nThat will install grub in the MBR of your first hard drive. Change /dev/sda accordingly if you want to install it elsewhere.\n", "Q: Why are there so few reviews in Ubuntu Software Centre? We all don't use it to install software but still, with millions of users worldwide, I'm surprised to see the amount of reviews for popular software.\n\n\n*\n\n*VLC (2026)\n\n*Chromium (1432)\n\n*Eclipse (271)\n\n\nIn comparison, Google Play has hundreds of thousands of reviews for VLC and other apps that are not that popular. Why is this?\nThe question is not aiming for an opinion based answer. I would like to know if there are factors that may reset or reduce the amount of reviews shown. Something like not showing other languages, locations or reseting the reviews when a package is upgraded.\n\nA: I think it's because so few people use the Ubuntu Software Center. Personally I prefer installing programs with the command line interface, with apt-get. \n", "Q: Ubuntu installation freeze I got this when trying to install Ubuntu 14.04.3 (x64) (tried with DVD and Flash drive):\n[     3.280511] ACPI PCC probe failed.\n\n[    34.929862] ata8.00: exception Emask 0x52 SAct 0x0 SErr 0xffffffff action 0xe frozen\n\n[    34.929870] ata8: SError: { RecovData RecovComm UnrecovData Persist Proto HostInt PHYRdyChg PHYInt CommWake 10B8B Dispar BadCRC Handshk LinkSeq TrStaTrns UnrecFIS\n\n[    34.929875] ata8.00: failed command: IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE\n\n[    34.929880] ata8.00: cmd a1/00:01:00:00:00/00:00:00/00 tag 22 pio 512 in\n\n[    34.929880]          res 40/00:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00/00 Emask 0x56 (ATA bus error)\n\n[    34.929885] ata8.00: status: { DRDY }\n\nI tried with F6 key (selected nomodeset alone and nomodeset with acpi=off) but it won't load... tried \"Try Ubuntu\" and \"Install Ubuntu\" but nothing happens.

I don't recommend it because it doesn't support 13.04+, and it isn't very compatible with Windows 8. But if there is really no way to get the CD/flashdrive version to work, you can give it a shot.\nWubi is a program that basically installs Ubuntu within Windows, so you would get a dual boot PC. The downside to this is that you can't delete Windows, or you'll delete Ubuntu as well. That said, Windows treats Ubuntu like a program so you can uninstall Ubuntu from Windows like you would with any other software.\nFor more information visit https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\n", "Q: Wifi problem after upgrade 14.10 to 15.04 After upgrade from Ubuntu 14.10 to 15.04 i have some problem with my wifi.

I just upgraded from Ubuntu server 14 to version 15. I had trouble getting my upstart script working after the upgrade, and read that systemd is the new default. I'm far from a linux expert, so please go easy on me :-)\nHere is what my upstart script was before:\ndescription \"NZBGet upstart script\"\n\nsetuid robert\nsetgid robert\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\n\nexpect fork\n\nscript\n    exec nzbget -D\nend script\n\npre-stop script\n    exec nzbget -Q\nend script\n\nBased on the upstart to systemd wiki page, I used the tables provided there to map things as closely as I could in my new systemd service file:\n[Unit]\nDescription=NZBGet Service\n\n[Service]\nType=forking\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/nzbget -D\nExecStop=/usr/local/bin/nzbget -Q\nRestart=on-failure\n\nThis file is located at /home/robert/.config/systemd/user/nzbget.service. To start the service manually, I've been doing:\n$ systemctl --user start nzbget\n\nThis works great. However, when I log out of my SSH session, the service shuts down. Also, it does not start on bootup or user login. I want it to behave the same as it did as an upstart service: I want it to start at boot, run constantly, and as a specific user.\nWhat do I need to do to get this configuration?\n\nA: You might be interested in using systemd's user lingering functionality. It is enabled via loginctl enable-linger USERNAME.\nIt causes a separate service manager for the respective user being started at boot, so your user-defined units in ~/.config/systemd/user will be picked up and processed at boot and shutdown times according to your service configuration.\nYou can also use systemctl --user for managing and configuring the service(s), which will operate on your user's service manager, not the one of the system.\n\nA: First problem\nYou can specify the directives User= and Group= in the [Service] section of the unit file.\nSecond problem\nTo make the service run on boot, you should not put it in your home folder. Instead, put it under /etc/systemd/system/. This is the folder meant to be used by the system administrator (i.e. you) to add new system-wide services.\nOther folders include:\n\n*\n\n*/usr/lib/systemd/system/ is meant for packages that want to install unit files, though under Debian and Ubuntu the folder is actually /lib/systemd/system/ because the various bin and lib folders have not been merged into a unified /usr/ prefix yet.\n\n*/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/ is for installing units by locally compiled packages.\n\nTesting the unit\nOnce the unit file is in an appropriate location, you can try starting the unit immediately by typing systemctl start <UNIT_FILENAME> as usual. It should work without having to type the unit's full path. The extension also doesn't have to be specified if it's .service.\nEnabling the unit\nBefore you can enable your unit, you need to add an [Install] section, under which you should add the directive WantedBy=multi-user.target. This directive specifies the stage of the boot-up process during which the service should be started (if it were enabled). multi-user.target is appropriate for most services.\nOnce that information is added, you can use systemctl enable <UNIT_FILENAME>, which enables the unit, making systemd from now on automatically start it during boot up at the specified stage.\n", "Q: How to make notification bubbles with custom size, colour and position using command line? I wonder if there is any command line method to make notifications in Ubuntu notification bubble. Or is there a file that belong to this task?\nI want the following characteristics:  \n\n\n*\n\n*My own messages appear in the notification bubble.\n\n*These notifications appear in a specific position on the screen, not\nonly in the default position.\n\n*The size of notification bubble can be changed.\n\n*Its color can be changed.\n\n\nUPDATE\nI read \"How can I send a custom desktop notification?\" and now, I know that notify-send will help me in my purpose. But there is some limitations with this command. I want to know whether there is any other command to use, or any file to change, so that size,color and position of notification bubble can be changed?\n\nA: Historically, there were different approaches to problem of \"notifications\". There isn't even consensus of what \"notification\" is. Do we use it to only tell user that something happened? Do we expect any action from him? If so, how is input gathered? Can that action be delayed, or should user act immediately? How long could it be delayed? How is user supposed to review all pending actions? Answers to all these questions shape solutions proposed by different teams.\nThe bottom line is, there is no single, definite answer to your question. But there are different approaches that you can try and pick one that fits your particular use-case.\nnotify-send\nAt one point, a standard for notifications on Linux emerged. The driving force behind it, if memory serves me right, was GNOME 3 team. They strove for unified way for all applications to notify user and figured out that some component of desktop environment should be responsible for handling (queuing, displaying, gathering input) all notifications. Applications merely send their notification to that component and hope that user receive it.\nYou can create that kind of notification with notify-send command line app. Note that it purposeful does not allow for customization. You only pass your message and leave the rest to desktop environment. This kind of notifications is supported by Unity (Ubuntu), GNOME 3 and KDE SC/Plasma.\nosd_cat\nosd_cat is application that displays content of file on X server layer. By using -d switch, you can make it automatically disappear after some time, which makes it somewhat suitable as notification app.\nThe default font will be ugly, but you can make it better by using -f switch. -f argument must be string constructed by xfontsel.\nA sample notification could be created this way:\necho -e \"sample\\nnotification\" |osd_cat -p middle -A center -d 1 -f '-*-helvetica-*-r-*-*-34-*-*-*-*-*-*-*' -O 1 -c '#fff'\n\nContrary to notify-send, you can place your notification anywhere on the screen and you can customize it a bit (select font and color; there is no background color). The main drawback is that it is X-specific, so it will not work under Mir or Wayland.\nzenity/kdialog\nzenity (for GTK desktops - Unity and GNOME) and kdialog (for Qt desktops - KDE and LxQt) allow user to create simple dialog windows from command line. You can put text inside, but also some predefined icons, buttons, input forms, lists, file pickers or progress bars. With a little work on your side, you could use them as a way to notify user.\nzenity supports --width= and --height= command line switches, but doesn't provide any way to change placement of window. Personally, I am using --title= to give window some custom title and window manager rules. Window manager (KWin in my case) picks all windows that match certain criteria, like title containing string, and modify their properties. For notifications I put these windows in lower right corner of screen, remove window title bar, make them appear on all virtual desktops and remove them from task bar.\nCustom solution\nIf neither of above programs suits your requirements, you can always write your custom solution. python provides bindings to both GTK and Qt and will allow you to relatively painlessly create custom GUI. You will have all the customization options in the world, but this will require some initial work to get started.\n", "Q: Error when I run sudo apt-get update Whenever I run sudo apt-get update, I get this error:                            \nE: GPG error: http://opart.org ./ InRelease: Clearsigned file isn't valid, got 'NODATA' (does the network require authentication?)\n\nI get the same error when I try to install something via the software center.\nFailed to download repository information, Check your internet connection\n\nAnd the details has the same error that I get on the terminal. \nThis is the output of sudo grep -R \"opart.org\" /etc/apt/ :\nsudo grep -R \"opart.org\" /etc/apt/\n/etc/apt/sources.list.save: deb opart.org/debian/ ./\n/etc/apt/sources.list.save:deb opart.org/debian/ ./\n/etc/apt/sources.list:deb opart.org/debian/ ./\n/etc/apt/sources.list:deb opart.org/debian/ ./\n\nI'v removed the http from the links since i cant post more than 2 links here.\n\nA: The side http://opart.org isn't longer available. \n\nThis web site is for sale\n\nTherefore\ngrep -rl 'opart.org' /etc/apt/ | xargs sudo sed -i '/opart\\.org/d'\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: Run in terminal\nsudo sed -i '/opart\\.org/d' /etc/sources.list\n\nThat will fix the issue with sudo apt-get update.\nThe problem was because you have added the software source that does not exist any more to your /etc/sources.list file.\n", "Q: ./configure output in terminal but also in file with 2>&1?

Is that correct?\nMaybe I'm super wrong here but I couldn't manage to find clear instructions.\nThank you!\nJ   \n\nA: Read man bash, especially the \"Redirection\" section.  \n2>&1\n\nredirects STDERR (the error stream) to the same place that STDOUT is going. \nWhat do you mean \"no longer where it needs to go internally\"? The STDERR and STDOUT streams are produced by ./configure as it goes about its business. How you process STDERR or STDOUT after the script outputs it generally won't affect the script (except lots_of_output | read_a_byte_an_hour). \nWhat do you want gedit to process? Where is gedit going to write the edited file?\nYou could  \n./configure 2>/tmp/stderr >/tmp/stdout  \n\nthen gedit either file.\nIf you want to save, STDERR along with STDOUT, and process it later, see man tee, and do:  \n./configure 2>&1 | tee /tmp/logfile | later_processing ...  \n\n", "Q: Revert to original version of python I am trying to install a package called nmoldyn in my system.

This information is only useful if we also have the screen's resolution, since e.g. 1680 could be the width of two (unlikely, but still) or one time the screen.\nLuckily, we can parse out the screen's resolution from the command xrandr.\nThen if we know the screen's x-size is 1680 and we currently are on VP: 1680,1050, we know we are on the second column in the workspace's matrix. Since we also know the size of the total matrix (DG: 3360x2100, also from the output of wmctrl -d), we know the current matrix includes two columns (3360/1680), and we are on the \"last\" one. \n\nThe script will then send an instruction to add a column to the matrix by the command:\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/hsize <current_viewport_column+1>\n\nThis is the principle.\nHow to calculate the workspaces to remove  (example columns)\nOnce per 10 seconds, the script runs the command to list all currently opened windows, with the command:\nwmctrl -lG\n\nThis gives us information on the window's position also, looking like:\n0x04604837  0 3425 24   1615 1026 jacob-System-Product-Name Niet-opgeslagen document 2 - gedit\n\nIn the output, 3425 is the x-position of the window. This figure is however relative to the current workspace (left side). To know the absolute position of the window (x-wise) in the workspace-matrix, we have to add the first number of the current viewport information (e.g. VP: 1680,1050, from the output of wmctrl -d). \nLet's however, for simplicity reasons, assume we are on viewport 1,1 (topleft viewport), so the window's relative position equals its absolute position.\nSince the screen's resolution is 1680, we know the window is on column 3425/1680, rounded up, since everything between 3360 and 5040 is on the same column in the matrix (between 3 and 4 times the resolution). For proper calculation we use math.ceil() (python)\nSince the script also practices the rule to always have an extra workspace on the right/below, we need to set the number of columns to the highest value of:\n\n\n*\n\n*the current workspace column + 1\n\n*the last column with a window on it\n\n*the default number of columns, as set in the head of the script\n\n\nAnd so the script does :)\nThe rows are managed in exactly the same procedure.\n", "Q: Where can one find sneak-peak of features of future releases?

Set Intel-graphics-acceleration to disabled if you use the Nvidia for output, and it should work properly :)\n", "Q: How to keep the Firefox Health Report on, but stop the data sharing I am running the latest version of Firefox (currently Firefox 40) which has the option to generate the Firefox Health Report:\n\nHowever, unlike on Windows and the Mac, there is currently no obvious way there to disable the data-sharing bit, but keep the Firefox Health Report generating bit. So I would like to know if there is any way of achieving this so that Firefox still generates the Firefox Health Report, however it does not share it with Mozilla?\n\nA: In order to achieve this go to your Firefox Health Report (put that into the URL bar and press ENTER): about:healthreport\nThen click on the button in the top right hand corner:\n\nSo that it becomes:\n\nYou have no disabled Data Sharing, this means that the report will still be generated, but no longer shared with Mozilla.\n", "Q: Folder created, owned by root (android create project) I'm running a script provided in the Android SDK, to create a project folder. But the folder is created with root ownership, and I need to work within it.\nI had the audacity not to install the SDK under my home folder, but rather under usr/local/lib... and I am wondering, since this is a priveleged location which I usually have to use sudo su to access, could this be the reason the project folder is owned by root? Or do the permissions assigned on folder creation fall entirely to the script that creates the project folder?\nAny other tips would be appreciated since I don't want to spend my days having to sudo incessantly... I need to set up some complex build scripts and would prefer it if that can be achieved by the user i.e. me, not root. P.S. I'm not sure if it's appropriate to go fiddle with these permissions if this is what has been set by whatever application / script, or I'd just do so.\n\nA: Generally anything in /usr/local is either owned by root or by the group \"staff\" in Debian distros. You can create a group that can write to that directory and add yourself to it if you want.\nsudo groupadd usrlocal\nsudo usermod -a -G usrlocal $user\nsudo chown -R /usr/local/* root:usrlocal\nsudo chmod 750 /usr/local\n\nAlso you can use the setuid bit to ensure that the SDK is always launched by root.\nsudo chmod +t /usr/local/sdk/script\n\nI think that may be what's causing your problem, if I understand correctly. If you need write access use '770' instead.\nEdit: (For the sake of completeness) Unless configured otherwise, any files a program it creates will be owned by the user that's running the program. If the script/program does not need root privileges, change the ownership to yourself:\nsudo chown /path/to/exec $user:$user\n\n", "Q: Updates to Ubuntu phone outside of the EU area I would like to find out if an Ubuntu phone (specifically the MX4) will receive OS updates if the phone is in use outside of the EU, (Canada in this case). I am thinking about bringing in an Ubuntu powered MX4 from Europe, I have already researched if the phone will work with the carriers over here...it will... (unlocked of course). \nSo it really just comes down to finding out if OS updates are possible outside of the supported area. Would this be done OTA independent of the carriers? (this is the way Apple does it) or would I be required to download and install updates via a computer connection.\nAny answers would be helpful.\nCheers\n\nA: Updates are over the Internet connection.

Recently, I've been into compiling software and distributing it. Last time I did it, I did so by building my program and running ldd on it to get all of the libraries it was linked against. I got the path of the library (like say /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6) and I copied and pasted it from my system. It worked great, but manually copying and pasting each library seemed repetitive. Is there a way that I can just get a list of the paths to the libraries alone (without all of the libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f1dc3333000)) so I can copy them and distribute them with my build?\n\nA: At that point, you are basically building a tarball of an entire Linux distribution. Depending on the libraries you link to, simply including the dynamic library itself may not be enough (some libraries depend on plug-in modules, and other external files, which are not installed in the same locations, as the same versions, across all distributions of Linux).\nThere are a few options to deal with these differences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Distribute the source code of your program and let the people whom you are distributing to, so that the users my compile it themselves, on their distribution of choice.\n\n*Re-compile a version of your program for every different version of every different distribution of Linux you wish to support, and distribute your program in packages for those distributions and versions.\n\n*Compile your application by using static linking, rather than dynamic linking. If you link to libraries that depend on external modules or files though, this can still be problematic.\n\n*Distribute a VM image of a specific Linux distribution which you wish to support, that is a minimal install, and has your program installed by default, to provide a full environment to run it in.\n\n\nA: I have it figured out (mostly).\nLet's suppose that the program I built that I plan to distribute is located at /bin/bash.

It is purposefully left untouched. It is not a partition, but a virtual partition (a file C:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk).\nThe principle of the migration is that you make an exact copy* of your Ubuntu install, *except that the old one is a Wubi install and the new one is a normal dual boot.\nThe migration doesn't help with partitioning, but it will check and prevent you from doing something stupid. E.g. trying to use an ext3 partition as swap. Or migrating to an extended partition. Or wiping out your Windows partition. Or migrating to a partition that isn't empty.\nDon't refer to that old ubuntuforums thread. Instead you'll find the latest info at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi.\nThe steps to migrate are described there. Use the script. If you do it manually then you don't get any of the checks and you can easily do damage if you make a mistake. But of course if you would like to do it manually, there is a link there to the instructions.\nFinally GRUB is the bootloader used by Ubuntu. You don't have to install it when you migrate, but you should. If you choose not to, then you can only get to the migrated install from your Wubi GRUB menu. And you'll have to install it manually later (this is easy enough). I can't go into all the details, but basically when you install GRUB you are giving Ubuntu the control of booting your computer - right now Windows has control - and if you don't install it, you need to boot via Windows, Wubi ... (and that means that your new install isn't in control and when it gets e.g. a new kernel, it won't be added to the Wubi GRUB menu). So, I'd recommend you just accept the default and install it.\nIf you want more help, edit your question with the output of sudo fdisk -l. Also, I always recommend a backup of important data, and a rescue disk (such as an Ubuntu DVD/USB). There are good reasons for doing this other than partitioning (e.g. hard drive failure) and it's always better to play it safe.\nFor partitioning, you're sitting on a large Windows primary partition of around 300GB, then an extended partition of 95 GB and another primary partition of 95GB. Ubuntu cannot install itself into free space scattered around... that is something you have to do yourself. In this case there is no real 'free' space as it's all contained inside existing partitions. What the Ubuntu installer can do is split the 300GB partition and create a new primary partition out of that space and install into that. Or split the logical partition '/dev/sda5'. \nIf you are migrating, or need more options, you will have to manually create free space by shrinking an existing partition, and use it to create a new primary partition; or expand the extended partition to absorb the new free space and then create more logical partitions. It's up to you to decide and how you choose to do it depends on your current usage, as well as how much space you would like for your Ubuntu install.\n", "Q: Fix wrong encoding of filenames strangely the encodings from some music I got from a friend with Windows 7 OS show up with a wrong encoding in nautlius . I already tried it with \nconvmv --notest -r -f windows-1255 -t utf-8 *\n\nbut it didn't fix it. It rather but another wrong encoding. I tried also with latin1 and latin3. Since I don't know what the original encoding was and I can't find that out, I keep wondering what my options are. \nThx for any advice.\n\nA: To try all the encodings, choose one of your files, eg mychosenfile.mp3m, and then loop\nthrough all the encodings. With luck you will find one that seems to be ok.\nThis just lists the possible new names:\nfile=mychosenfile.mp3\nfor enc in $(convmv --list)\ndo  echo $enc: $(convmv --parsable -f $enc -t utf-8 \"$file\")\ndone\n\n\nAlternatively, you can rename the files to the song track and title taken from the id3 tag if they have one.\nFor example, (this just echo's the mv command):\nfind mydir -name '*.mp3' |\nwhile read file\ndo if newname=\"$(id3info \"$file\" |\n        awk -F': ' '\n         /^=== TRCK/{ track = $2 }\n         /^=== TIT2/{ title=$2;gsub(\" \",\"_\",title) }\n         END        { if(title!=\"\")printf \"%02d_%s.mp3\\n\",track,title }\n        ')\"\n   then dir=$(dirname \"$file\")\n        echo mv \"$file\" \"$dir/$newname\"\n   fi\ndone\n\n\nA: To remove special characters from all filenames, use detox:\ndetox -r -v -s utf8 /path/to/files/\n\nYou may also pass -n to see what it will done and verify it sounds sensible.\nTo rename all files according to their music tags, use lltag:\nlltag -R --mp3v2 --mp3read=21 --rename '/new/path/%a/%A/%n %t' /path/to/files\n\nYou should consider passing --dry-run to first invocation to see what will be done; pass --yes if you are tired of answering questions (might affect quality of new names in case of missing tags and the like).\nMore details are in man detox and man lltag.\n", "Q: Can't change brightness using DDControl with Catalyst driver I have a Samsung SyncMaster SA100. This monitor doesn't come with buttons to change the brightness, only a power button. The guys at Samsung say that you should change the brightness using a proprietary program that they made, like, 8 years ago and only works in Windows.\nFor the last couple years I've been changing the brightness of my monitor using DDCcontrol. It's a pretty old program, but it's the only one (that I know) that can change the brightness using DDC/CI.\nThe problem is that it worked fine with ATI's open source drivers, but with the closed source ones I get the following message:\nDetected monitors :\nNo monitor supporting DDC/CI available.\nIf your graphics card need it, please check all the required kernel modules are loaded (i2c-dev, and your framebuffer driver).\n\nI already ran modprobe i2c-dev and modprobe radeonfb (which I believe is the frame buffer module needed.)\nIs there a step I'm missing or another way to change brightness? Going back to the Open Source drivers is not an option as the screen tears a lot with them.\nI am on Kubuntu 15.04 using XFCE and the GPU is an ATI HD 5670.\n\nA: This is kinda old, but I had a similar problem, i was getting the same error message. I solved it by running the program with sudo.\nsudo gddccontrol\n\nAs additional note regarding the ATI/AMD driver, since 16.04 Ubuntu forces the open source driver so if the proprietary driver was the problem, it can not be any more.\n\nA: The fglrx driver does not create /dev/i2c devices, which is why the usual tools do not work with it.   Instead, support for DDC communication is part of its API.\nddccontrol does have iftested code that appears to handle this case, so you may have luck building your own copy.  I have not tested it.\nYou can also use the more recent ddcutil which uses the fglrx API for DDC communication.   However, since the license in the fglrx header files prevents their distribution with ddcutil, you'll have to build your own copy.  Instructions are here\n", "Q: How long should I wait before upgrading to Ubuntu 15? I am new to this 'fast-update process' and wondering what the suggested  time would be to wait before switching from (let's say) 14.04 to 15.04?\nMy main concerns are compatibility issues and unavailable software.\n\nA: 15.04's been out since April, so a lot has been fixed by way of compatibility, performance and bugs. It might be better to stay on 14.04, though, since it's LTS, which means longer support. 16.04 will also be LTS, so if you want an upgrade, that'll be it. It's really up to you.\n\nA: 15.04 is not an LTS release. You can't directly upgrade from 14.04 to 15.04. And 14.10 is not supported any more. \nIf you really need 15.04, then it is better to do a fresh install. But it is better to stick with LTS if there is no specific reason to upgrade.\n", "Q: unloggable machine after login trashed by sudo startx I have read previous posts on this topic. sudo startx seems a very bad idea. The problem is that I now have no way to login to a terminal or gui session. The suggested solutions to the problem seem to suggest the manipulation of user files which are now secured (blocked off from access). I seem to have blocked ssh or never initiated it. I cannot recall ever having a \"root\" password.  Is there any solution for this scenario. (thanks)\n\nA: Boot from your Ubuntu (or any other Linux) installation drive, sudo to root and then chown your files back.\n\nA: The problem of \"can't log in after sudo startx\" has many duplications and various proposed remedies seemed to work for some cases; I will outline my conclusions since it took a while for me to find the solution that worked for me. \nBTW, if you enter a wrong password, the login dialogue tells you so. When the password is correct but the user files are mashed, the screen goes blank then silently returns to the login dialogue.  \nFor me, the most crucial step was getting the grub options to come up during reboot. Left shift key (the most recommended option) would not work. Escape finally did work but was timing dependant. This is with Ubuntu 14.10. May be the older keyboard I use is a problem.\nOnce I could get to the root prompt: \n\n\n*\n\n*mount -o remount,rw /         [makes the file system writeable] \n\n*cd /home                      [change to home directory]\n\n*ls -l1                        [user directory must be owned by user]\n\n*cd /home/myusername           [change to the user directory]          \n\n*ls -li .ICEauthority          [.ICEauthority file must be owned by user]\n\n*ls -li .Xauthority            [.Xauthority file must be owned by user]\n\n\nIn my case the fault was with ownership of the .Xauthority file. It had become owned by root. I changed using chown.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo chown myusername:myusername .Xauthority\n\n*ls -li .Xauthority            [check to see the owner change worked]  \n\n\nfinally reboot machine.\n", "Q: How can an internal hard drive be made completely inaccessible for the system? I've \"rescued\" my whole main system HDD onto another fresh drive (using a live CD, to be able to easier access / and /usr from X11), and now I'd like to pretend as if I had physically removed the old drive.\nThe reason is simple: since the target drive is an exact clone of the source drive (including UUIDs!), Ubuntu may easily get confused when trying to figure out what is what.\nAnd no, I would not want to open the PC and unplug the cable: I would prefer to do this via a software solution.\nThis is why I'd like to make the source drive inaccessible, so that even /dev/sdb does no longer exist.\nThose \"tricks\" mentioned in other answers that simply put the HDD to sleep (hdparm -Y) do not work here, because I've checked these possibilities and gparted still \"knew\" about the old drive.\nI would not consider the solution I am looking for to be working until gparted really skips from /dev/sda to /dev/sdc.\n\nA: The only way to \"to pretend as if I had physically removed\" a disk is to disconnect it:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Power down your system  \n\n*Open your system, wearing a grounded anti-static strap.\n\n*Physically remove the Power cable from the disk. Be very careful, and remember how to replace the cable. Removing the Data cable is not needed. Leave the disk in place.  \n\n*Put your system back together.  \nIf the disk is powered, and physically connected to the bus, it MUST be visible to the BIOS, and, when it is booted, Ubuntu. Otherwise, you would complain \"Ubuntu cannot see my disk!\".\n", "Q: How to chain Ubuntu bootloader with openSUSE bootloader with LUKS? I have an openSUSE Tumbleweed setup in LUKS with LVMs on /dev/sda2, and the bootloader is stored in /dev/sda1.\nI would like to install Kubuntu 14.04 to a separate hard-drive (in this case /dev/sdc). Ideally the Kubuntu setup can also be run from a LUKS setup. The hard drive in this case has already been prepared with the required /, home and swap partitions.\nHow can I set up a boot-loading regime which allows both distributions to maintain their own separate bootloading schemes, by having an independent bootloader managing the grub setup for both distributions?\n\nA: So this is a quick and dirty setup with both grub bootloaders in use. I installed both bootloaders in their separate partitions on their respective drives.\nThe bootloader for openSUSE was installed in /dev/sda1 and the bootloader for Kubuntu in /dev/sdc1.\nSince I haven't yet figured out how to get Kubuntu to recognise the full disk LUKS installation of openSUSE, I instead used openSUSE as the primary boot loader. It also helps that as I only encrypted the /home folder for Kubuntu instead of the full disk encryption I did for openSUSE, which made it easier for the openSUSE boot loader to find the other OS.\n", "Q: Clamav-Daemon Can't Open lmd.user.ndb, won't start Can't start clamav-daemon, and searching for help on the error has turned up nothing.\n * Starting ClamAV daemon clamd\nLibClamAV Error: cli_load(): Can't open file /var/lib/clamav/lmd.user.ndb\nLibClamAV Error: cli_loaddbdir(): error loading database /var/lib/clamav/lmd.user.ndb\nERROR: Can't open file or directory\nClosing the main socket.\n\nlmd.user.ndb is linked to: /usr/local/maldetect/sigs/lmd.user.ndb\nWhich is in turn linked to: /usr/local/maldetect/tmp/.runtime.user.4696.hdb, which is a file that doesn't exist.\nAt the moment my email server isn't working, so I'm really stuck.

In fact I'm writing this on an Asus S56C now running Ubuntu 15.04. I've upgraded the SSD to 120GB and it runs really well. As the 24GB is quite small I would suggest putting the /home or /usr directory on the second HDD. You will need to disable secure boot and manually setup the partitions to handle the UEFI. There is a good write up here.\nhttp://www.tecmint.com/ubuntu-15-04-installation-on-uefi-firmware/\n", "Q: usb Ethernet adapter disapear after Stoping network-manager service I am using D-Link (DUB-E100) for handling 2 seperated network under linux ubuntu 14.04. at first i have 2 eth on my system .\nifconfig yields:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr b8:ae:ed:70:27:3e  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.200  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::baae:edff:fe70:273e/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:13717 errors:0 dropped:35 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:452 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:1262738 (1.2 MB)  TX bytes:82012 (82.0 KB)\n          Interrupt:20 Memory:f7c00000-f7c20000 \n\neth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 54:b8:0a:ef:cf:c6  \n          inet addr:192.168.0.183  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::56b8:aff:feef:cfc6/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:117675 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:17937811 (17.9 MB)  TX bytes:3777428 (3.7 MB)\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:344851 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:344851 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:26624855 (26.6 MB)  TX bytes:26624855 (26.6 MB)\n\nbut after this command :\nsudo service network-manager stop\nHere is what I get in ifconfig:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr b8:ae:ed:70:27:3e  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.200  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::baae:edff:fe70:273e/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:13717 errors:0 dropped:35 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:527 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:1262738 (1.2 MB)  TX bytes:96519 (96.5 KB)\n          Interrupt:20 Memory:f7c00000-f7c20000 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:346012 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:346012 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:26759532 (26.7 MB)  TX bytes:26759532 (26.7 MB)\n\n,So in this situation i lost my second network ,(i have to stop network-manager beacaus before stopping it,I dont recieve any udp packet from other local devices on my local area network (eth0)), how can I have two connection simultaneously,\nis there any way to have eth1 after stopping network-manager?\nUPDATE1:\nMy /etc/network/interfaces is: \nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.200\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\nUPDATE 2:\nI changed My /etc/network/interfaces is:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.200\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\nauto eth1\nallow-hotplug eth1\niface eth1 inet dhcp\ngateway 192.168.0.1\n\nand it could not solve my problem. \n\nA: This happens because your eth1 interface is managed by Network Manager.\nWhen you stop the service, the interface is disabled.\nYou can setup /etc/network/interfaces and not use NM for both devices.\nBut your problem is mainly because you did not set proper routing and iptables.\n", "Q: How to remove .htaccess file When i try this:\nls -lh:\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  401 Sep 20 07:11  .htaccess\n\nBut i can't remove it.\nrm .htaccess  \nrm: cannot remove ‘.htaccess’: No such file or directory\n\nor lsof \".htaccess\":\nlsof: status error on .htaccess: No such file or directory\n\nSo is the file still exist?, and how to remove it.\n\nA: I found out the problems.

Now when i insert that hdd in my portable and i change boot settings from bios i'm able to run Ubuntu correctly, while if i start the external hard drive from my pc it just jumps it and starts the next hard drive available.\nMy pc has an Asus Crosshair V Formula-Z motherboard with usb3 ports as the portable has. \nHow do i solve this issue?\nEDIT:\nThe point is thet i need to use it on both computers; works perfectly in the protable, the only missing thing is making it run on the PC. Don't want dual boot actually: when the external hdd isn't inserted i don't want my computer to look for it; i'll just destroy ubuntu after university xD\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure, but if you installed ubuntu from your notebook(or whatever) it has saved your HW configuration, so it'll only run on machine you used to install it.\nIf you need to run system that is installed on one medium on multiple PCs, you need to choose some portable distro, they are designed exactly for that.\nI don't knou what exactly you want it for, but you could use Ubuntu install disk with some persistence.\nAnyway, the easiest way is still installing it as dual-boot on both machines, it is easy and on internet there are many manuals.\n", "Q: Cannot install curl-config in Ubuntu 12.04 When trying to install the R package RCurl I get the following error:\nchecking for curl-config... no\nCannot find curl-config\nERROR: configuration failed for package ‘RCurl’\n\nYet, curl-config exists in the system:\n$ curl-config --version\nlibcurl 7.43.0\n\nThough it lays in the anaconda folder\n$ which curl-config:\n.../anaconda/bin/curl-config\n.../anaconda/pkgs/curl-7.43.0-0/bin/curl-config\n\nSo I try to install it properly so that R finds it.

Trying to start from terminal gives me the error Could not create gnome accelerators directory '/home/<username>/.gnome2/accels': Permission denied. I was still able to start both programs using sudo. After seeing that the entire ./.gnome2 was under root ownership I changed the ownership of /home/<username>/.gnome2/accels to my user. Now I am able to start Firefox again, but for Thunderbird I still get the same error. So I changed ownership of the entire ./.gnome2 folder recursively, which enabled me to open both programs normally again, but some the programs do not access the right profiles now, as all my mail addresses are gone in Thunderbird as well as all Add-on setting in Firefox. Now I would like to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*What led  to this problem?\n\n*What would be the right way to resolve it?\n\n\nA: You have run firefox and thunderbird as root, or via sudo. This is a Bad Idea, for many reasons. One is that any files (including configuration files) saved will be owned by root. Another reason is that running them as root makes them Very Powerful Foot-Shooting tools.\nTo repair, change the ownership of the directories and their contents with (read man sudo;man chown; man id first):  \nsudo chown -R $(id-u):$(id -g) ${HOME}/.gnome2 \n\nTo find the other files and directories in $HOME that are owned by root, you could do:  \nsudo find ${HOME} -user root -ls  \n\nTo find files that $USER is not allowed to access:  \nsudo find $HOME \\! -readable -ls\n\n", "Q: Create a shared VirtualBox hard disk I know you can use a shared folder, but is it possible in VirtualBox for all VMs to have a second hard disk, the same VirtualBox hard disk?\n\nA: It is absolutely possible to attach any virtual hard drive we had created to as many virtual machines we want.\nJust open the VirtualBox Manager to attach the corresponding .VDI file (or other supported format) on \"storage\" settings.\nAll virtual drives attached to another VM will not be removed when deleting any given VM.\nWe need to make sure we do not change data needed for all VMs to be running as this may break other VMs. Therefore (even though possible) it is not recommended to share an OS-containing VDI, but you could put your HOME partition on such a VDI.\nNote that you can not run virtual machines simultaneously when the same virtual drive is attached to both of them.\n\nA: I suspect the correct answer is the one suggested by @hakermania in the comment. \nRationale: a \"virtual disk\" in VirtualBox is seen by the client as a SATA disk --- a piece of hardware connected to the SATA interface of the machine. \nNow, physical SATA disks can't be shared between machines, so the OS is not prepared to do this --- controlling and managing conflicts and concurrency. \nOn the other hand, shared folders act as network shares under the point of view of the client OS, and they are commonly shared between machines --- all the needed technology is in. \nWhat you probably can do is use a virtual machine to share (via virtual network) a virtual disk --- but I suspect that @hakermania idea is simpler and probably more efficient (never tried, YMMV). You can also probably use the same disk (as pointed by @Takkat) in several VMs... although I do not think they can do it together: https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=8573, although it seems that recent VBoxes can do that --- http://www.oracledistilled.com/virtualbox/creating-shared-drives-in-oracle-vm-virtualbox/ (not trivial though) \n", "Q: How to sync OneDrive on Ubuntu 14.04?

How can install and use \"OneDrive-D\"?\n\nA: As @terdon said Onedrive-D is still under development.\nAlternatively you can use other cloud storage services.\nHere is the instruction on how to install \"OneDrive-D\":\nStep1: Download the program from GitHub. \nStep2: Extract the contents of the .zip file and run the installer from “onedrive-d-master.”\nFor that Press Ctrl+Alt+T and execute:\ncd ~/Downloads\nls\nunzip onedrive-d-old-future.zip\ncd onedrive-d-old-future\n./install.sh\n\nNote 1: I used ls command to list files in that folder and to avoid mistakes in file names.SInce there is another new project for same purpose.\nNote 2: onedrive-d need python-3. Refer here for prerequisites,but all necessary softwares will be  installed ,during installation process.So no need to worry about prerequisites.\nStep 3: After installation you will see message like this:\nonedrive-d installed successfully.\nPlease run command `onedrive-pref` to set up the program.\n\nNow open terminal and run:  onedrive-pref\n\nOpen the link in browser and enter your user id and password.\nyou will see prompt like this :\n\nClick on YES. Then copy the link and paste it in terminal.You will see message like this:\nonedrive-d has been successfully authorized\n\nNext,you need to adjust settings,if you want to keep default settings just press n .If you want to change press y and adjust.\nExample: \n(STEP 2/4) Do you want to specify path to local OneDrive repository? [Y/n] y\n Please enter the abs path to sync with your OneDrive (default: /home/[name]/OneDrive):\n Path successfully set.\n(STEP 3/4) Do you want to change the numeric settings?

It is NOT a locally available filesystem. It is still remote. Some programs can read and write to this remote drive, and some don't. A workaround is to open a secon TAB in Nautilus, copy the files you need to the second TAB. Use them from there and copy them back afterwards.\nSource: Rclone and Rclone-Browser\n", "Q: Changing resolution for samsung monitor?

You would then need to add the xrandr configurations to a startup file, so that you'll get your desired resolution upon reboot/startup.\nYou can do all this hassle-free using a simple program; ResolutionX - it is a graphical front-end to randr, so if xrandr works for you, so will that.\n", "Q: Downgrade xorg-server According to this bug report, intel-virtual-output encounter some difficulties with xorg-server version 1.17.1:\ndavid@david-ubuntu:~$ intel-virtual-output \nXIO:  fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server \":0\"\n      after 20 requests (20 known processed) with 0 events remaining.\n\nAs reported by a user, downgrading to version 1.16 would solve the problem.

Check your connection I have installed TeamViewer 10 in Ubuntu 14.04 and used it with mobile Internet (USB tethering). It worked well, but once I disconnected the mobile device and connected the system to an office Internet (LAN) with Internet access, it shows this error information: Not ready. Please check your connection. I have checked all proxy settings but nothing worked - I need to use my office system at home through TeamViewer. How should I proceed to make TeamViewer work on LAN?\n\nA: Sometimes after switching the network connection (wired/wireless), TeamViewer service hangs.\nTo fix this - restart teamviewer service. Open a terminal and execute the following commands :  \nsudo teamviewer daemon stop\nsudo teamviewer daemon start  \n\nAlternatively you can restart the teamviewer service with : sudo teamviewer daemon restart\nTo check if the service was restarted successfully execute : sudo teamviewer daemon status \nWhen it doesn't solve the problem, check if TeamViewer is blocked by the firewall of the router.\nIf you are working with an office system provided by a company, it may be blocked within there.  \nAdditional information addressing the comments under the answer \"Didn't work for me\" : \nSometimes the installation of teamviewer by clicking the .deb file, which opens the Software Center, doesn't install the application including all required dependencies properly and hence fails.\nHaving installed and used TeamViewer successfully for many years, I can recommend to install TeamViewer by using the gdebi packaging tool, to install it execute sudo apt install gdebi. Right-click the .deb installation file and select to open it with gdebi - then start the installation.  \nUpdate December 2017 : TeamViewer 13 was released, for the first time as a native Linux client.\nThe installer added a TeamViewer repository which currently seems to be not correctly configured.\nThis may be due to the fact that TeamViewer 13 Linux is still only available as a preview edition. To avoid apt errors, I recommend to remove the repository and install new versions manually until the issue is fixed, to achieve this execute sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/teamviewer.list.  \nUpdate April 2018 : I've tested TeamViewer 13 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (running on Xorg) and the application installed correctly by clicking the .deb file.

Interestingly, the situation explained their is quite contrary to mine:\n\nThe problem is at least partially fixed. When dumped to the grub shell the \"set\" command is useful. It clearly showed the prefix as being set to \"(hd0,gpt1)/boot/grub\". This folder and the stub grub.cfg did not exist and instead the stub grub.cfg was in the /EFI/ubuntu folder in the EFI partition instead. I manually created /boot/grub/ in the EFI partition and copied the stub grub.cfg into it and that was all she took.\n\nFor me however, the prefix was .../efi/ubuntu but it should be efu/grub. To me, it really looks like this is an Ubuntu bug. The proper fix for this issue would be to change the prefix, but I also have no idea where it is coming form. TL;DR: So instead, as a work-around, I copied /boot/efi/EFI/grub to /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu and voilà.\n", "Q: How to recover deleted files in ubuntu using live usb? [based on filetype] I had accidentally deleted a few files from an Ubuntu Desktop.\nNow I need to recover only the perl files which had been sitting in /home/user directory. \nHow can this be done?\nI am able to boot using a live Ubuntu USB. \nPlease explain.\n\nA: Before you start:\n\n*\n\n*It's always a good idea to work from a copy of your deleted data, so copy your entire disk before you begin.\n\n*If you cannot, boot from a Live-USB/DVD before you begin.\n\n*If you cannot, know that by each and every single byte you write to your disk right now, one byte of one of your deleted files will be overwritten! (i.e. by installing PhotoRec and TestDisk, some deleted files will be overwritten by  the applications that you're going to install if you continue!)\n\n\nWhat are the main differences between TestDisk and PhotoRec?\nTestDisk is a lot more efficient than PhotoRec. The problem with TestDisk is that it doesn't always recover all deleted files. If you accidentally reformat a partition, TestDisk can recover thousands of files without missing a single file, but if you deleted a file by sending it to the Trash and then emptying the Trash, TestDisk can't always recover it.\nSo use TestDisk first, and if you recovered all of the deleted files with TestDisk, then you're done. If you recovered most of the deleted files with TestDisk, you can decide whether you're done or not. If you're not done after running TestDisk, you can try recovering the deleted files using PhotoRec.\nPhotoRec can selectively recover files based on their filetype(s), but PhotoRec / TestDisk can't selectively scan an individual directory for lost files unless you had mounted a whole hard drive partition as this directory. In some cases, the filename is stored in the file itself. PhotoRec tries to recover the filename in this case, but most of the time PhotoRec can't recover the filenames.\n\nRecover files based on filetype using PhotoRec\n\n*\n\n*Install TestDisk from the Ubuntu Software Center.\n sudo apt-get install testdisk\n\n\n\n*Launch PhotoRec.\nOpen a terminal and launch photorec (as root).\n sudo photorec\n\n\n\n*Select hard disk.\n\n\n*Select partition type.\nIf your hard disk has Linux partitions, then select [Intel].\n\n\n*Select filetype option.\nMove to [File Opt] and press Enter. Here you can disable all file types by pressing s. Use space to toggle the check button. Select filetype(s) to recover. For Perl you can select pl for Perl script or pm for Perl module.\n\n\n*Select options.\nPhotorec also has a list of different options. Under normal circumstances you don’t need to modify them.\n\n\n*Select partition.\nMove the selector up or down to the partition from which you have removed the file(s). Then select [Search] and press Enter.\n\n\n*Select filesystem type.\nIf you are using Linux, it's going to be ext2/ext3/ext4, so the default selection is ext2/ext3. Otherwise if you are recovering files from a partition formatted as FAT or NTFS select Other.\n\n\n*Select space for analysis.\nSelect Free if you didn’t write to that partition after removing the particular file, otherwise select Whole.\n\n\n*Select a directory for the recovered files\nSelect the path where the recovered files will be stored. Then press Y.\nPhotorec will show how many files it has recovered.\nSource: revised from How To Recover Deleted Files in Linux Using Photorec\n", "Q: How to transfer songs from Ubuntu PC into iPod touch 5g I'm having a hard time trying to find a good solution to this problem.\nI want to transfer songs to my iPod touch 5g just like I can through iTunes in Windows.

The printer has been automatically recognized and installed correctly on my laptop running the newest elementary OS distro.\nOn Ubuntu, I don't have the option to run the automatic installer, clicking on printers shows me the manual configuration page:\n\n\nI installed the newest HPLIB (3.15.9) which supposedly supports the HP Deskjet 3055a printer and ran it normally, using sudo and using su. None of it helped. HPLIB is installed, the printer is located but no print job reaches the printer. The only thing that changed is that when installing with root privileges, the computer was able to receive status information, while it couldn't otherwise.\nI'd like to note, that the printer is connected to the network using WiFi. Our system is set up this way: The printer is connected to a router/bridge (don't know which term is appropriate here), which is responsible for our WiFi. The router/bridge is connected to a LAN router which is receiving the data from and transmitting the data to the web. (We access the internet via the TV cable.) The computer which is unable to send print jobs is mainly connected to the TV-cable-router using LAN. But I also have a WiFi dongle plugged in and also tried to set up the printer while connected to the network via dongle.\nThe printer had a different IP when trying to connect using the dongle (192.168.1.107). The IP shown using the WiFi dongle exactly the one shown on the printer's display. Still doesn't work though. (While connected via cable the IP is 192.168.0.10)\nFollowing the generic troubleshooting guide for HPLIB, I was able to ping the IP address. But when trying the following:\nsnmpwalk -Os -c public -v 1 ip.address.of.printer 1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.1.1.7.0\n\nsnmpwalk was unable to get a response (yes I replaced the placeholder with the IP). HPLIB documentation does not provide any info on how to fix the SNMP configuration, instead it reads:\n\nIf you do not get this sort of response then there is a problem with\n  your snmp configuration. Ensure that the required dependencies for\n  snmp are installed and/or refer to your distro documentation.\n\nAs I only found some fancy server stuff, I'm stuck here.

Chances are you've got hardware that's not supported by the kernel you're trying to use. This problem can sometimes be overcome by using a more recent kernel, which in turn normally means a more recent version of Ubuntu. (Well, unless you've got the technical skill to compile your own kernel from scratch, but you wouldn't be posting this question if you had those skills.)\nAlong those lines, \"Ubuntu 14\" and \"Ubuntu 15\" are insufficiently precise. Ubuntu version numbers are based on the year and month of the release, with releases occurring in April (\".04\") and October (\".10\") of each year. Thus, there have been 14.04, 14.10, and 15.04 releases, with 15.10 due out in about a month (October 22). Every even-numbered year, the April release is a long-term support (LTS) release, with \"point release\" updates every few months. LTS versions are supported for five years, but non-LTS releases are supported for just nine months, IIRC. Thus, going with an LTS support is best if you don't want to upgrade every 6-12 months; but if you need support for bleeding-edge hardware, you may need to stick with a non-LTS release and plan to update to the next LTS version (which will be 16.04). Currently, the latest LTS release is 14.04.3. Thus, the versions with the most up-to-date kernels are 14.04.3 and 15.04; however, the 15.10 pre-release version (available here) has an even more current kernel. I recommend you try those versions. If none of them work, file a bug report. Include screen shots like the ones you posted and complete make and model information on your computer.\nIf you need a working computer running Linux now but can't get any current Ubuntu release working, you might try an unrelated distribution -- Fedora, OpenSUSE, Arch, etc. (Some distributions, such as Mint, are actually derived from Ubuntu and so are almost certain to do no better than Ubuntu.) There's a modest chance that one of them will have a kernel that will work, just because they may have incorporated an updated or new driver first. If that doesn't work or is unacceptable to you, you'll have to return the computer to the store and buy a new one.\n", "Q: Python-samba causing failed apt-get calls Recently re-booted my fileserver and found it would not boot.

But it was in early 2013, and you report that you use 14.04, so your packages shouldn't be affected.\nStart by running dpkg -S _sysconfigdata_nd.py to verify that this file is indeed installed. If it is not, then you might try reinstalling libpython2.7-minimal package. If it is, run python and type import sys; print sys.path to get a list of directories where python will look for modules. I guess that directory where _sysconfigdata_nd.py is is not on that list.\nIf it isn't you might try one of workarounds posted in mentioned bug report: sudo ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu/_sysconfigdata_nd.py /usr/lib/python2.7/ or sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv.\nIt is also possible that your multiarch configuration is broken, but this could only happen if you have modified it sometime in the past.\n", "Q: Brief Installation I am using windows since i got into computers, so i thought Ubuntu would replace my interests in computer programming. Now i think its time to install Ubuntu (only) on my laptop. I have no idea about different partition methods. I wanted all files in the hard disk after installing Ubuntu.

Is it possible to keep the data after installing Ubuntu on windows?. If yes i want to know how to make partitions solely for Ubuntu and have it installed on my laptop. \n\nA: You will have the option to partition when installing Ubuntu. Go to ubuntu.com, download the iso file, and make a new USB, e.g. with LinuxLive USB Creator(http://www.linuxliveusb.com/) Restart PC, and start from the newly created USB. Be careful to choose the option to partition your hard drive; don't format it.

With Windows (almost certainly) installed in EFI/UEFI mode and Ubuntu installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, there's no way for the BIOS-mode GRUB to start the EFI-mode Windows. If you followed instructions to activate BIOS/CSM/legacy support, those instructions were wrong. (There are cases when this is appropriate, but obviously not in your case.)\n\nChange Legacy to UEFI.\n\nThat's half of the solution. You'll also need to install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. I'll get to that shortly. In the meantime, you must find a way to access either your firmware setup utility or your computer's built-in boot manager. I realize you say you can't access your \"BIOS\" (you mean the firmware setup utility; you don't have a BIOS), but you should focus on overcoming that problem. Some computers are very sensitive about the timing of keys to get into the firmware setup utility or boot manager, so you should try Esc, Del, Enter, and every function key multiple times. You might also contact Acer's technical support or post on an Acer-specific forum for help on this score. As a last-ditch effort, you can unplug your hard disk from the computer and it will probably boot into the setup utility.\nIf you can get into the firmware setup utility:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the CSM/legacy support.\n\n*Disable any \"fast start\" option or anything with a similar name. This feature can be one reason why keypresses won't get you into the setup utility or boot manager, so disabling it can help.\n\n*Look for other options that might affect your ability to boot into the setup utility. For instance, if one is present, you might want to activate an option to do a full USB initialization, which may get the keyboard working during boot.\n\n\nThe built-in boot manager lets you select between OSes, and may also have an option to start the setup utility. It should let you select between Windows and a BIOS-mode boot option that will launch GRUB and Ubuntu. You can use this to get into Windows. If you plug in an EFI-bootable USB flash drive, you should be able to boot it from this menu, too. This brings us to the next point....\nOnce you're able to control your boot process, you must install an EFI-mode Linux boot loader. There are a number of ways you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu installer in EFI mode and re-install Ubuntu. Since you've not used it for long, this may be an acceptable solution. You can verify an EFI-mode boot by looking for the /sys/firmware/efi directory. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS mode.\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu installer in EFI mode and run the Boot Repair tool. This will normally set up an EFI-mode version of GRUB.\n\n*Disable Secure Boot, download a USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager, and prepare a boot medium with it. You should then be able to boot rEFInd, which should enable you to boot either Windows or Ubuntu. If that works, boot to Ubuntu and install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package. This will give you rEFInd, rather than GRUB, as your primary boot tool. You may be able to re-enable Secure Boot at this point, but that's optional. \n\n\nA: I'm not familiar with the Win10 bootloader, but here was my solution for getting Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu dual-booting from GRUB.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect every drive except the Windows one.\n\n*Install Windows on the drive.\n\n*Disconnect your Windows drive and attach your other drive, make sure it is attached to the lowest-numbered SATA port on your motherboard (mine is SATA_0).\n\n*Install Ubuntu to that drive.\n\n*Reconnect your drives, make sure the Ubuntu drive is first in your boot order.\n\n*Install boot-repair and run it.\n\n*You should be up and running.\n", "Q: MASS Add more Clusters?

Then I found out that many games I like don't work with Wine, so I decided to install Windows 7 as dual-boot.\nMy question is - can this be done simply by resizing the Xubuntu partition and installing Windows on a new NTFS one? Or would this require backing up all the data, formatting the drive and reinstalling Xubuntu unencrypted, then Windows?\n\nA: You can install W7 without lose any data... just resize the Xubuntu partition using Disks utility and creating a new NTFS one.\nOnce you install W7, probably you won't be able to boot Xubuntu; don't dismay: this can be fixed with EasyBCD (http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/) adding a new entry for Xubuntu (selecting GRUB2) and aiming to the ext4 partition where Linux is installed, and you can even decide what OS will be the default option. Don't be afraid, just make a backup of the MBR... EasyBCD allows you to. It have a very intuitive interface. You won't have any problem to use it, I hope.\nIt can happen, too, that some crazy future update on Xubuntu restore de GRUB2 original boot... then you won't be able to boot Windows; once again, don't dismay: this can be fixed using Lilo...\nsudo apt-get install lilo\nsudo lilo -M /dev/sda mbr\n\nOf course, you must be sure that your hard disk is /dev/sda.\nAbraham Medina.\n", "Q: Problem building intel-virtual-output Following this guide and many others I'm trying to getting my ThinkPad w520 with ubuntu gnome 14.04.3 (64bit) work with bumblebee.

I use rsync to do incremental backup of the local ext3 HD in my laptop onto an ext4 HD connected through USB to the laptop. I assume that rsync treats both these HDs as local, so I'm wondering if rsync performs any kind of verification of the files copied.\nLooking at the man page it seems that it does (\"Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking a whole-file checksum that is generated as the file is transferred, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option's before-the-transfer \"Does this file need to be updated?\" check.\"), but this is contradicted on StackExchange. So I'm wondering do I need to do the verification myself? And if so, should I use diff or rsync -c after the actual execution of rsync?\nAs far as I understand the verification performed by rsync is only a verification of the transfer of the file, not the writing of the file to disk. Verification of the writing of the file to disk is, as far as I can find out, left up to the underlying driver/file system. Is this safe enough? Is ext4 capable of detecting and warning if a write went wrong? And will rsync report it?\nSince this is more a questions of data verification and possible data corruption I have inserted a couple of more tags, to help my post be read by the right people. I also tried to expand a bit on the question itself.\n\nA: The part of the man page that you mention has to do with the -c option. As the man reads at the beggining\n\nRsync finds files that need to be transferred using a lqquick checkrq\n  algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed in size\n  or in last-modified time. Any changes in the other preserved\n  attributes (as requested by options) are made on the destination file\n  directly when the quick check indicates that the file's data does not\n  need to be updated.\n\nwith the -c option it checks if two files are of equal size, and if so checks the checksums of the two.\nrsync also verifies the transfer of the file through the network, not the disk. If you want to make sure that your data are not corrupted you could use utilities like md5sum.\nas a side note: I don't think that this procedure qualifies as an \"incremental backup\" since incremental backups stores the differences to the system from an earlier backup. I think \"incremental transfer\" is more appropriate.\n\nA: \nIs this safe enough? \n\nI would assume yes. If you want rsync to do a check you need to run rsync -c after copying so you can have some extra verification using rsync. Or use a md5sum on the files.\n\nIs ext4 capable of detecting and warning if a write went wrong? \n\nYes. We are talking about drivers and the filesystem so an error any of these will result in an exit code. Of course there is a worst case scenario here: if the driver/filesystem is faulty the  exit code could be wrongly sent as correct. I would not assume this to be correct myself and use a tool like md5sum to check the results myself.  \n\nAnd will rsync report it?\n\nAs soon as the receiving end errors out so will rsync.\n", "Q: Convert image color channels? So, I have an image and I want to be able to set the Red and Blue values so they're equal to the value of the Green in the image.

If you just want to try Ubuntu and you are using a relatively powerful machine, you can use a Virtual Machine like Virtual Box. It's free and there are plenty of guides out there that tell you how to use Ubuntu on a VM. Additionally, you may have heard of Wubi which would be relevant here but it does have issues with Windows 8. For more information, see Wubi: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide. This is risk-free approach.\nIf you are dead set on using Ubuntu and want it installed as a dual boot, you need to create a partition for it. You do this using a partitioner such as GParted. You will need at least 20G of space for Ubuntu. Warning: Back up all of your data when resizing partitions. Resizing disks comes at a small risk of data loss + any derps! Once you have resized your disk, you can simply install Ubuntu on the space you have reserved for it. A tutorial for GParted can be found here: http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gparted.html. You can avoid partitioning completely by using a spare/multiple HDDs.\nOnce you have some disk space, simply run the Ubuntu ISO and ensure you select the reserved partition during the Install process. The installer will take care of the rest. Note that the installer will replace MBR with GRUB Boot Manager but GRUB will happily boot to Windows. In order to switch between the two, simply restart and select Ubuntu/Windows at start up. This will be the case for both BIOS and UEFI systems.\nSimple!\n", "Q: Dependency error: Unable to install Anjuta IDE I'm unable to install anjuta studio in Ubuntu 15.04 using the Gnome 3.16 DE.\nThis is the output of terminal:\nshivam@shivam-Inspiron-3521:~$ sudo apt-get install libjavascriptcoregtk-2.4.9-0\nReading package lists...

Is there a way to find out all of the supported settings for a given version of cron?\n\nA: It is mentioned in the man page, you just need to look at the right one.\nFrom man 5 crontab:\nBy  default,  cron will send mail using the mail \"Content-Type:\" header\nof \"text/plain\" with the \"charset=\" parameter  set  to  the  charmap  /\ncodeset  of the locale in which crond(8) is started up - ie. either the\ndefault system locale, if no LC_* environment variables are set, or the\nlocale  specified  by  the LC_* environment variables ( see locale(7)).\nYou can use different character encodings for mailed cron job output by\nsetting  the  CONTENT_TYPE  and  CONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING variables in\ncrontabs, to the correct values of the mail headers of those names.\n\nNow you might ask how do i know which one to look at. Well, from man man :\n\nThe table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by\n  the types of pages they contain.\n   1   Executable programs or shell commands\n   2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)\n   3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)\n   4   Special files (usually found in /dev)\n   5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd\n   6   Games\n   7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)\n   8   System administration commands (usually only for root)\n   9   Kernel routines [Non standard]\n\n\n", "Q: How to disable welcome message after SSH login? I have changed /etc/issue.net, so I have set a \"personal\" message after typing a username in an SSH terminal. Now I am trying to change the welcome text after successful login.\nI have found a lot of posts about the /etc/motd file, but the part \"Welcome to Ubuntu blabla versionnumber and so on\" +  \"* Documentation URL \" is not there?\nI just do not want to show OS info in my SSH terminal, I already know what I have installed. :)\nI only want to see my last login. And also not errors; errors belong in a logfile.\nWhich file do I have to edit?\n\nA: The welcome messages are generated by the files residing in /etc/update-motd.d/.\nFrom man update-motd:\n\nExecutable scripts in /etc/update-motd.d/* are executed by pam_motd(8)\n  as the root user at each login, and this information\n         is  concatenated  in  /var/run/motd.\n\nSo if you don't want the outputs of those scripts upon login via ssh just remove the execute flag on them:\nsudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/*\n\nNow if you want to show something you want upon login, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a script, put it in /etc/update-motd.d/, make it executable, also make sure it outputs on STDOUT.\n\n*ssh has a Banner option. You can put the text in a file and set it in the Banner option so that the content of the file is shown upon login via ssh. Note that this is applicable to only ssh.\nBanner /etc/foobar\n\nFrom man 5 sshd_config:\n Banner  The contents of the specified file are sent to the remote user\n         before authentication is allowed.  If the argument is “none” then\n         no banner is displayed.  This option is only available for\n         protocol version 2.  By default, no banner is displayed.\n\n\nA: You can also nuke pam_motd altogether:\nsed -i '/^[^#]*\\<pam_motd.so\\>/s/^/#/' /etc/pam.d/sshd\n\nPAM calls pam_motd depending on the settings in /etc/pam.d, and typically the entries are:\n$ grep pam_motd /etc/pam.d -R\n/etc/pam.d/login:session    optional   pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic noupdate\n/etc/pam.d/login:session    optional   pam_motd.so\n/etc/pam.d/sshd:session    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic noupdate\n/etc/pam.d/sshd:session    optional     pam_motd.so # [1]\n\nJust commenting out the pam_motd lines from these files will disable it.\n\nA: Another way that does not require administrative rights is to place an empty file called\n.hushlogin\n\ninto your $HOME directory (using for example touch ~/.hushlogin).\nThe downside to this solution is that you might miss a message saying something like\nLast login: Wed Aug 22 16:00:10 2007 from l33t.hax0r.some.ips\n\nthat indicates your account has been compromised.\nSource.\n\nA: There might also be file under /etc/motd containing a welcome message which can easily be removed (the content).\n", "Q: no Wi-Fi on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Asus notebook with MEDIATEK MT7630e I'm new to Ubuntu.

It would be really nice to have some alias or variable called \"editor\" I might use in all scripts / commands / launchers and link this alias to an app that might be changed any time later without affecting those commands.\nHow could I do that? Thank you :)\n\nA: The EDITOR and VISUAL variables are well-known variables commonly used for this purpose (cron, sudo, bash, etc. use it). Usually, VISUAL takes precedence over EDITOR. However, both are typically used in non-GUI environments. Nothing prevents either from being a GUI program, but they usually aren't.\nYou can usually respect the user's settings in an desktop environment by using xdg-open. xdg-open relies on various desktop-environment specific tools like gnome-open or kde-open (How does xdg-opendo its work?).\nSo, in scripts, just do:\nxdg-open /some/file \nxdg-open proto://some/uri\n\n\nA: There is already a generic binary called editor i.e. /usr/bin/editor provided by the Debian alternatives system (update-alternatives).\nThis binary is actually a symbolic link to /etc/alternatives/editor :\n$ ls -l /usr/bin/editor \nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 24 Feb  9  2015 /usr/bin/editor -> /etc/alternatives/editor\n\nwhich in turn is a symbolic link to the actual editor select based on priority or manually :\n$ ls -l /etc/alternatives/editor\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18 Feb 10  2015 /etc/alternatives/editor -> /usr/bin/vim.basic\n\nNow if i open a file with :\neditor ~/.bashrc\n\nthis would actually do :\nvim.basic ~/.bashrc\n\nLets change the editor :\n$ sudo update-alternatives --config editor \nThere are 5 choices for the alternative editor (providing /usr/bin/editor).\n\n  Selection    Path                Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n  0            /bin/nano            40        auto mode\n  1            /bin/ed             -100       manual mode\n  2            /bin/nano            40        manual mode\n  3            /usr/bin/nedit       40        manual mode\n* 4            /usr/bin/vim.basic   30        manual mode\n  5            /usr/bin/vim.tiny    10        manual mode\n\nThe one with the * is the currently selected one, navigate to the one you like and select that by pressing Enter or directly use update-alternatives --set or you can set priority as you and see in the third column by update-alternatives --install command. To get information about something you can use update-alternatives --query or update-alternatives --list commands.\nTo install a new alternative use update-alternatives --install command. For example adding the editor /usr/bin/foobar to the editor alternative system and giving it a priority of 100 so that this would be the default now :\nsudo update-alternatives --install editor /etc/alternatives/editor /usr/bin/foobar 100\n\nCheck man update-alternatives to get details.\n\nA: You can try creating a soft link named editor which points to the current editor you are using. When you switch to some other editor you can simply point the soft link to your new editor.\nCommand to create a soft link named editor to point to Sublime text 3:\nln -sf subl3 editor\n\nBetter create this soft link in either /usr/bin or /bin, otherwise add the directory containing link to your PATH that it is accessible from terminal and scripts.\n", "Q: Error: Failed to execute child process \"kfmclient\" (No such file or directory) I'm using PCManFM and recovered my Lubuntu 14.04.3 Trusty Tahr recently.

Have you monitored your system under load, identified bottlenecks, etc?\nYou can find the \"services\" started by the system with  \nsudo service --status-all  \n\nthen look in /etc/init/servicename.conf and/or /etc/init.d/servicename to see how the service start up. Preventing service startup could be as simple as changing start=1 to start=0 in /etc/default/servicename. Not all services are this easy. DO THE RESEARCH \nAnother way to find \"services\" is via:  \nsudo lsof -i  \n\nand look for \"LISTEN\", and read man lsof.  \nBe sure you understand what a service does, and which other services on your system depend on it, before you make changes.  \nMost importantly (why is this always at the end?), Keep track of what changes you make, and try to make your changes reversible. For example, instead of  \nsudo rm /etc/service.conf\n\nwhich deletes the file, do\nsudo mv /etc/service.conf /etc/service.conf.DISABLED\n\nwhich keeps the file, but, since it is no longer called /etc/service.conf, it not used by the example service. \n", "Q: Questions about a Dell Dimension 2400 I have recently acquired a Dimension 2400. I have upgraded it to 1 GB of RAM in hopes to install ubuntu. I have installed windows 7 in the meantime, i had some troubles with drivers but finally got it working. I was fluffing about the internet and found some drivers that may or may not work.\nMy question is: What Ubuntu version should i get? and What should i do to install these drivers: link?\n\nA: If you want to try out the latest version of Ubuntu, 15.04 Vivid Vervet will be your choice.\nHowever, it will reach its end-of-life in January 2016.\nIf you want to use a more long-lasting version, you can use 14.04.1 Trusty Tahr LTS. It will be supported until April 2019 (for 14.04.2, 14.04.3, they are Trusty Tahr as well, but the kernel they use will be supported till August 2016, which means that you will be facing a major kernel upgrade by that time)\nFor the driver stuff, most of the drivers (e.g. Intel graphic driver) are included in the kernel, except those proprietary drivers, if everything works fine with just Ubuntu installed, then you don't need that driver pack. As this driver pack was published in 12/17/2004, I think it's already available in the kernel.\n", "Q: Inserting text with a keyboard shortcuts in Ubuntu I know we can insert some unicode characters by pressing ALT+[code] combination under Windows, right? I would like to have a similar option under Ubuntu, however in addition to that I'd need to choose my shortcut keys and text to be inserted. For example, I want to insert \"⭐\" character with a combination (it doesn't matter what combination, it may be even ALT + SHIFT + CTRL + 123).\nIs this even possible?\n\nA: You can hit Ctrl+Shift+U, type an Unicode code point and hit Enter to insert the character bound to that Unicode code point;\nFor example, to insert ⭐:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Ctrl+Shift+U\n\n*Type 2b50\n\n*Hit Enter\nI suggest you to keep using this method, as most Ctrl+[...], Alt+[...] and Shift+[...] sequence will end up conflicting with other functions; however if you really want to use a custom shortcut, you can try your luck and bind a custom shortcut to an xdotoolcommand in System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts; for example, the xdotool command to insert ⭐ would be:\nxdotool key --window '$(xdotool getactivewindow)' Ctrl+Shift+U2B50\n\n\nA: Alternatively you can enable compose keys to create these symbols or even strings of text with ease without remembering these annoying keyboard number-letter combinations. \nOpen GEdit and insert the following:\ninclude \"/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose\"\n\n<Multi_key>     <1>     <2>     <3> : \"Your text\"   # Quick description\n<Multi_key>     <s>     <t>     <a> : \"⭐\"  U2B50    # Star Symbol\n\nSave this as .XCompose (case sensitive) in your home directory.\nOpen your keyboard settings (system settings → keyboard settings) and go to the shortcuts tab.\nUnder the \"typing\" section you'll find a \"Compose Key\" setting.

This sounds like a good idea to me.\nThis is what \"apt-get -s autoremove\" proposes for removal:\n  freeglut3 fs-uae fs-uae-launcher gir1.2-gtksource-3.0 hwdata ipython kmymoney-common libalkimia4 libexosip2-11 libglee0d1 libgnome-desktop-2-17 libgtksourceview-3.0-1 libgtksourceview-3.0-common\n  libgwengui-cpp0 libgwengui-qt4-0 liblinphone5 libmediastreamer-base3 libofx6 libosip2-11 libosp5 libpanel-applet0 libportmidi0 libpyside1.2 libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-mixer1.2 libsdl-ttf2.0-0\n  libsensors-applet-plugin0 libshiboken1.2 libsmpeg0 linux-headers-3.19.0-15 linux-headers-3.19.0-15-generic linux-image-3.19.0-15-generic linux-image-extra-3.19.0-15-generic meld python-dulwich\n  python-fastimport python-numpy python-opengl python-pexpect python-pygame python-pyside python-pyside.phonon python-pyside.qtcore python-pyside.qtdeclarative python-pyside.qtgui python-pyside.qthelp\n  python-pyside.qtnetwork python-pyside.qtopengl python-pyside.qtscript python-pyside.qtsql python-pyside.qtsvg python-pyside.qttest python-pyside.qtuitools python-pyside.qtwebkit python-pyside.qtxml\n  python-simplegeneric python-svn\n\nFor most of them I have no idea in which context I installed them. But at least one of these packages is definitely NOT unused: The emulator \"fs-uae\" was manually installed by me and I intend to continue using it. \nWhy does apt-get propose to remove the \"fs-uae\" package? Is there a way to cleanup with breaking anything and without removing something I need?\n\nA: As you probably already know, in Linux packages may specify \"dependencies\", that is other packages that must be installed in order for this package to actually work. These dependencies are resolved recursively, that is dependencies of your package dependencies are installed as well. This way meta-packages may exist that will install entire set of software. Common examples are libreoffice (for office suite) or kde-full for entire KDE desktop.\nWhen apt (Debian package manager) installs some package, it marks all dependencies as automatically installed. This way it can distinguish between packages explicitly requested by user and packages that were pulled in merely as dependencies (about which user most likely don't care at all).\napt-get autoremove looks up for packages that are marked as automatically installed, but which are no longer needed by any manually installed packages. These are often older versions of libraries (when version of library is in package name to allow different versions to coexist, e.g. libavcodec54 and libavcodec56) or packages removed from repository, but sometimes some useful application gets pulled in as dependency and then is removed. This happens especially when you first tell apt to install recommended or suggested packages, but then configure it to not pull in these packages as dependencies.\nTo remove package from list of packages considered for removal, mark that package as installed manually. You can do it using apt-mark:\napt-mark manual <package_name>\n\nor aptitude (following commands are equivalent, use only one):\naptitude unmarkauto <package_name>\naptitude install <package_name>\naptitude install <package_name>&m\n\nFinally, to get some context when these particular packages were installed, you can try searching their names in /var/log/apt/history.log files.

At some point in the trace i got this:\ns18132051.onlinehome-server.info (87.106.64.11) [closed]\n\nSo i reset my ip tables, and that did the trick. \nSo either there where some hidden rule in the table, or iptable -L did not give me all rules. I will mark this as the answer as it fixes the problem.\nI would still love to hear, how come i didn't get any blocking rules when doing iptables -L\n\nA: I experienced the same problem, but on Debian 8.4 (Jessie). Like the above, the solution was the IPTables flush script as listed at http://insanelabs.net/linux/linux-reset-iptables-firewall-rules/. Though iptables reported no rules, there must have been some \"hidden\" rules, or otherwise a bug in iptables itself. I am reporting this bug to the Debian maintainers.\nIn case the linked site goes down, here is the full text of the script in question, reproduced here for convenience.\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"Flushing iptables rules...\"\nsleep 1\niptables -F\niptables -X\niptables -t nat -F\niptables -t nat -X\niptables -t mangle -F\niptables -t mangle -X\niptables -P INPUT ACCEPT\niptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT\niptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT\n\n\nA: You didn't list all of your rules.  I've found a good way to get any active netfilter tables is:\nfor blah in sudo /bin/cat /proc/net/ip_tables_names; do sudo /sbin/iptables -t $blah -L -vn --line-numbers|sed \"s/^/$blah:      /\" ; done |less -RXF\nAnother options is to run:\n/sbin/iptables-save\nIf you have the patience, you can go through each rule one at a time and change any DENY targets to ACCEPT and see which one fixes the problem.\n", "Q: Installing of graphic card driver amd hello im very new to ubuntu and would appreciate some help if possible, i read before i must install gpu drivers i had to update system so i did, then i went on AMD website and downloaded the driver version 15.7 and installed it, i followed this guide. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evqpassbyqA , it didnt work then i read i should try to use system and update so i did the system update process again and tried then i booted up to a purple screen and then it proceed to go black after, i got amd 7660g and 7670m gpu's my laptop is a hp m6 1040eo would really appreciate all the help possible :)\n\nA: You do not need to download anything from AMD web site.\nThe correct way of installing AMD drivers in Ubuntu is running in terminal\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-updates\n\nBut if you installed a driver another way, it may not work. You need to remove the other driver first.\n", "Q: What is your favorite HexEditor? What are the most available open source GUI hex-editor for the Ubuntu LTS 14.04 Desktop? I have HexEdit running on OS X, and am looking for something similar. A bit more modern perhaps, with good functionality, stability, easily installed and integrated. This is a system for a novice programming student learning Linux and examining code. how would you compare: Ghex, Bless, and wxHex? Any suggestion appreciated.\n\nA: Bless is a high quality full featured hex editor.\nBless currently provides the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Efficient editing of large data files and block devices.  \n\n*Multilevel undo - redo operations.\n\n*Customizable data views.\n\n*Fast data rendering on screen.\n\n*Multiple tabs.\n\n*Fast find and replace operations.\n\n*Advanced copy/paste capabilities.  \n\n*Highlighting of selection pattern matches in the file.     \n\n*Export to text and html (others with plugins).  \n\n*Extensibility with Plugins.\n\n\nYou can compare hex editors here.\nInstallation:\nPress Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get install bless\nAlternatively\nclick this link.\n\nA: I have been using wxHexEditor - full featured / stable + source !\nHandles HUGE files with ease (only limited by your RAM)\nsudo apt-get install wxhexeditor  #  then launch using  wxHexEditor\n\n___ OR ___\ngit clone https://github.com/EUA/wxHexEditor.git \ncd wxHexEditor\nmake -j$(nproc)\nsudo make install\nwxHexEditor\n\nBefore compiling wxHexeditor you need wxWidgets and autoreconf on your system ... just install those libraries :\nsudo apt-get build-dep  wxhexeditor   \n\nif make gives you this error\nmake: *** No rule to make target '-lgomp', needed by 'src/HexEditorGui.o'.

I want to partition my hard drive and I've tried this with a USB, DVD but I can't.\nI created a bootable USB and I'm not able to boot it from my computer. Normally you put the usb in the port, restart the computer, enter boot options and that's it. I can't do it. Whenever I restart my computer There's no F2 option to enter the setup, just F12 option to enter Boot Manager and whenever I enter that I get this.\n\nI've tried getting into legacy and I still can't do it.\nI did this with a DVD but still nothing.\nWhat can I do?\nEdit: I downloaded ubuntu 14.04.3 64 bit\n\nA: You need to find a manual for this laptop. It should tell you how to get into UEFI aka bios settings. It is not always F2. It may be ESC or some other key combination. For Dells Fn+F1 may work.\nSome laptops have a fast or quick boot option. In this mode the laptop does not detect USB sticks on boot. You will need to disable this feature.\nAlso you can try to fully power off your laptop, not just reboot. In this case that boot from USB may work.\nBut you need also to take in account that Windows 8 does not really power off the computer by default, it just hibernates it. This Windows feature should be disabled prioir to Ubuntu installation.\n", "Q: Unexpected Logout on Ubuntu 14.04 (or is it X crash?) maybe once a day it happens. It is an unexpected log out.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I apologize for being such an inexperienced user.\n\nA: GRUB cannot boot a Windows kernel directly; GRUB can only chainload to the Windows boot loader. Fortunately, recovery disc images for Windows are readily available for download. Check Microsoft's site. (I don't have a specific URL handy, unfortunately.) After you recover the Windows boot loader, it will probably be set as the default. You can fix this in Windows as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch an Administrator Command Prompt window by right-clicking the Command Prompt icon and selecting the option to run it as Administrator.\n\n*Type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi. (If Secure Boot is disabled, grubx64.efi will work as well as shimx64.efi, but shimx64.efi usually works even if Secure Boot is disabled and so is a safer option.)\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nOnce you've got everything working, I strongly recommend you back up your EFI System Partition (ESP; partition #2 in your case). The ESP is usually mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu, and a file-level backup is fine, so you can back it up with cp, tar, zip, or similar tools. With a backup, you'll be able to restore it easily in case this problem crops up again.\n", "Q: How do I change the location of Gnome Shell notifications? The GNOME Shell has the notifications at the bottom by default. Unfortunately, I like to use the dash to dock and stick it at the bottom. Meaning I can't see the notifications anymore.

It can only read.\nPlease help.\n\nA: /media/mntpoint is just a folder on your hard drive where the mount command is going to mount the partition of the drive to.  Look on your hard drive and look in the /media folder.  You should see other folders in there that are mount points.  You can create a folder for that mount point of your choosing.  \nAn example:\nmkdir -p /media/mac\n\nthe above line would create a folder called mac in the /media folder that you can use to mount your Mac drive to. \nSo, the mount command would then be:\nsudo mount -t hfsplus -o force,rw /dev/sdxy /media/mac\n\nwhere you would now access the folders on that drive in the /media/mac folder on the drive.  Once in that folder you should be the contents of the Mac drive.\nIf it is already mounted, try the following line to remount the drive:\nsudo mount -f hfsplus -o remount,force,rw /dev/sdc2\n\nthis is assuming that /dev/sdc2 is your Mac drive partition.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Safari on Ubuntu 14.04?

A better question is why service network-manager works at all.\nAccording to the service man page:\n   The  SCRIPT  parameter  specifies  a  System  V init script, located in\n   /etc/init.d/SCRIPT, or the name of an upstart  job  in  /etc/init. \n\nSo, since there is a /etc/init/network-manager.conf file, service can query it, but there is no autocompletion because there is no script of that name in /etc/init.d. \nA simple workaround would be to create an empty file called network-manager in /etc/init.d:\nsudo touch /etc/init.d/network-manager\n\nOnce you've done that, you can tab-complete the name as expected. I tested this in a VM and it seemed to work fine, the service network-manager start|stop|restart|status commands all worked and nothing seemed to be broken. I assume that means that the empty file is ignored and only used for the completion, so it looks like this is safe. \n", "Q: How to install Midori browser on Ubuntu using PPA?

I messed up my system earlier, I was greeted with a black screen, when booting in to Ubuntu. When I started up my laptop, I selected the recovery option from the grub menu, and chose fallback at root terminal. I saw that I was able to use the add user command, with it, I probably could use to create a privileged user on my machine. \nIsn't that a security issue?\nOne could have stolen my laptop and at startup chose recovery and add another user, I'm fudged then. Including my data.\nCome to think of it, even if you somehow remove that entry, one could boot from a live-CD, get a chroot up and running and then add another user, with the right privileges that allows it to see all my data. \nIf I set the BIOS to boot at my HD only, no USB, CD/DVD, Network startup, and set a BIOS password, it still wouldn't matter, because you'd still have that grub recovery startup entry.\nI am fairly certain that someone from China, Russia can't hack my Ubuntu Trusty Tahr, from the network, because it's secure like that. But, if one has physical access to my - your - machine, then, well, that's why I'm asking this question. How can I secure my machine so that hacking through physical access is not possible?\n\nBug Report:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bug #283662 “no login promt at “recovery mode\"-boot” : Bugs : Ubuntu\n\nA: My guess is that only full disk encryption using a strong algorithm and, most important, good password is the only thing that can secure your locally stored data. This gives you probably 99.99% security. Please refer to one of the many guides on how to do this.\n\nBesides than that, it is NOT possible to secure your machine from an experienced hacker with physical access.\n\n\n*\n\n*User/account passwords:\nIt's easy to create a new admin user if you boot into recovery mode, as you described yourself, because you get a root shell without being asked for passwords this way.\nThat might look like an accidental security issue, but is intended for (who would have thought that?) recovery cases, where you e.g. lost your admin password or messed up the sudo command or other vital stuff.\n\n*root password:\nUbuntu has not set any root user password by default. However, you can set one and will be asked for it if you boot in recovery mode. This seems pretty secure, but is still no ultimately secure solution. You can still add the kernel parameter single init=/bin/bashthrough GRUB before booting Ubuntu that starts it in single user mode - which is in fact a root shell without password too.\n\n*Securing the GRUB menu with a password:\nYou can secure your GRUB menu entries to be only accessible after authentication, i.e. you can deny booting the recovery mode without password. This also prevents from manipulating the kernel parameters. For more information, refer see the Grub2/Passwords site on help.ubuntu.com. This can only be bypassed if you boot from an external medium or connect the HDD to another machine directly.\n\n*Disable booting from external media in BIOS:\nYou can set the boot order and usually exclude devices from boot in many current BIOS/UEFI versions. Those settings are not secured though, as everybody can enter the setup menu. You have to set a password here too, but...\n\n*BIOS passwords:\nYou can usually bypass BIOS passwords as well. There are several methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset CMOS memory (where BIOS settings are stored) by opening the computer case and physically removing the CMOS battery or temporarily setting a \"Clear CMOS\" jumper.\n\n*Reset BIOS settings with a service key combination. Most motherboard manufacturers describe key combinations in their service manuals to reset messed up BIOS settings to default values, including the password. An example would be to hold ScreenUp while turning on the power, which, if I remember right, unlocked an acer motherboard with AMI BIOS once for me after I messed up my overclocking settings.\n\n*Last but not least, there are a set of default BIOS passwords that seem to always work, independent of the real set password. I did not test it, but this site offers a list of them, categorized by manufacturer.\nThanks to Rinzwind for this information and link! \n\n\n*Lock the computer case/deny physical access to the motherboard and hard disk:\nEven if everything else fails, a data thief can still open your laptop/computer, take the HDD out and connect it to his own computer. Mounting it and accessing all unencrypted files is a piece of cake from thereon. You have to put it into a securely locked case where you can be sure nobody is able to open the computer. This however is impossible for laptops and difficult for desktops. Maybe you can think of owning an action film like self-destructing device that blows up some explosives inside if somebody tries to open it? ;-) But make sure you'll never have to open it yourself for maintenance then!\n\n*Full disk encryption:\nI know I advised this method as secure, but it also is not 100% safe if you lose your laptop while it is on. There is a so-called \"cold boot attack\" that allows the attacker to read the encryption keys from your RAM after resetting the running machine. This unloads the system, but does not flush the RAM contents of the time without power is short enough.\nThanks to kos for his comment about this attack!\nI'm also going to quote his second comment here:\n\nThis is an old video, but explains the concept well: \"Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys\" on YouTube; if you have a BIOS password set, the attacker can still remove the CMOS battery while the laptop is still on to enable the custom crafted drive to boot without losing any crucial second; this is scarier nowadays due to SSDs, as a custom crafted SSD will probably be capable to dump even 8GB in less than 1 minute, considering a write speed of ~150MB/s  \n\nRelated, but still unanswered question on how to prevent Cold Boot Attacks: How do I enable Ubuntu (using full disk encryption) to call LUKSsupend before sleeping/suspending to RAM?\n\nTo conclude: Currently nothing really protects your laptop from getting used by someone with physical access and malicious intent. You can only fully encrypt all your data if you're paranoid enough to risk losing everything by forgetting your password or a crash. So encryption makes backups even more important than they're already are. However, they should then be encrypted too and located in a very safe place.\nOr just don't give your laptop away and hope you'll never lose it. ;-)\nIf you care less about your data but more about your hardware, you might want to buy and install a GPS sender into your case though, but that is only for the real paranoid people or federal agents.\n\nA: There are a couple of hardware solutions worth noting.\nFirstly some laptops, such as some Lenovo business laptops come with a tamper detection switch which detects when the case is opened. On Lenovo this feature needs to be activated in BIOS and an admin password needs to be set. If tamper is detected the laptop will (I believe) immediately shut down, on startup it will then display a warning and require the admin password and the proper AC adapter to proceed. Some tamper detectors will also set off an audible alarm, and can be configured to send an e-mail.\nTamper detection doesn't really prevent tampering (but it may make it harder to steal data from the RAM - and tamper detection may \"brick\" the device if it detects something really dodgy like trying to remove the CMOS battery). The main advantage is that someone can't covertly tamper with the hardware without you knowing - if you have set up strong software security such as full disk encryption then covert tampering with hardware is definitely one of the remaining attack vectors.\nAnother physical security is that some laptops can be locked to a dock. If the dock is securely mounted to a table (via screws which will be under the laptop) and the laptop kept locked to the dock when not in use, then it provides an additional layer of physical protection. Of course this wont stop a determined thief but it definitely makes it harder to steal the laptop from your home or business, and while locked it's still perfectly usable (and you can plug in peripherals, ethernet and so on to the dock).\nOf course, these physical features aren't useful for securing a laptop which doesn't have them. But if you are security conscious it may be worthwhile considering them when buying a laptop.\n\nA: Additionally to encrypting your disk (you won't get around that):\n- SELinux and TRESOR. Both harden the Linux kernel and try to make it difficult for attackers to read things from memory.\nWhile you are at it:\nWe now enter the territory of not only fear of evil random guys wanting your debit card info (they don't do that) but often enough of intelligence agencies.\nIn that case you want to do more:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to purge evrything closed-source (also firmware) from the PC. This includes UEFI/BIOS !\n\n*Use tianocore/coreboot as new UEFI/BIOS\n\n*Use SecureBoot with your own keys.\n\n\nThere are plenty of other things you can do but those should give a reasonable amount of things they need to tickle with.\nAnd don't forget about:\nxkcd ;-)\n\nA: Because you changed the question a bit, here is my answer to the changed part:\n\nHow can I secure my machine so that hacking through physical access is not possible?\n\nAnswer: You can't\nThere are lots of advanced hardware and software systems like tamper detection, encryption etc, but it all comes to this:\nYou can protect your data, but you can't protect your hardware once someone had access to it. And if you continue to use any hardware after someone else had access, you are endangering your data!\nUse a secure notebook with tamper detection that clears the RAM when someone tries to open it, use full-disk encryption, store backups of your data encrypted in different locations. Then make it as hard as possible to get physical access to your hardware. But if you believe someone had access to your hardware, wipe it and throw it away.\nThe next question you should ask is: How can I acquire new hardware that hasn't been tampered with.\n\nA: The most secure laptop is the one without any data on it.  You could set up your own private cloud environment and then don't store anything of importance locally.\nOr take out the hard drive and melt it down with thermite.  While this technically answers the question, it might not be the most practical since you won't be able to use your laptop anymore.  But neither will those ever-nebulous hackers.\nBarring those options, dual-encrypt the hard drive and require a USB thumbdrive to be plugged in to decrypt it.  The USB thumbdrive contains one set of decryption keys and the BIOS contains the other set - password protected, of course.  Combine that with an automatic data self-destruct routine if the USB thumbdrive is not plugged in during boot/resume from suspend.  Carry the USB thumbdrive on your person at all times.  This combination also happens to deal with XKCD #538. \n\n\nA: Encrypt your disk. This way your system and your data will be safe in case your laptop is stolen. Otherwise:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS password won't help: the thief can easily extract the disk from your computer and put it on another PC to boot from it.\n\n*Your user/root password won't help either: the thief can easily mount the disk as explained above and access all your data.\n\n\nI would recommend you to have a LUKS partition in which you could set up a LVM. You could leave your boot partition unencrypted so that you only need to enter your password once. This means your system could be more easily compromised if tampered (stolen and given back to you without you even noticing), but this is a very rare case and, unless you think you are being followed by the NSA, a government or some kind of mafia, you should not be worried about this.\nYour Ubuntu installer should give you the option of installing with LUKS+LVM in a very easy and automated way. I am not re-posting the details in here, as there is already plenty of documentation out there on the internet. :-)\n\nA: Use an ATA password for your HDD/SSD\nThis will prevent the use of the disk without the password. This means you can't boot without the password because you can't access the MBR or the ESP without the password. And if the disk is used inside another manchine, the password is still required.\nSo, you can use a so-called user ATA password for your HDD/SSD. This is usually set inside the BIOS (but this is not a BIOS password).\nFor extra security, you can set a master ATA password on the disk too. To disable the use of the manufacturer password.\nYou can do this on the cli with hdparm too.\nExtra care should be taken because you can loose all your data if you loose the password.\nhttp://www.admin-magazine.com/Archive/2014/19/Using-the-ATA-security-features-of-modern-hard-disks-and-SSDs\nNote: There is also weaknesses here as there are softwares that claim to recover the ATA password, or even claim to remove it. So it's not 100% safe either.\nNote: ATA password does not necessarily come with FED (Full Disk Encryption)\n", "Q: Custom locale settings when launching program from KDE menu In KDE, I have noticed that GTK programs don't use the locale settings I specify in the KDE system settings, but rather the system-wide default locale.

I have two subnets, let's say 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24, which are connected by one Ubuntu server with two interface cards (eth0 and wlan0). There are lot of descriptions using NAT in a way that the hosts are hidden behind the router. I would like to ping hosts in both subnets vice-versa. How do I need to configure the Ubuntu server?\n\nA: The section about where and which routes to set is still a work in progress. It depends on the network topology.\nFirst, you have to make sure the clients on each side of the router actually use the router to send packages to the other network. That is, you'll have to set appropriate routes. \nDepending on the rest of your network, there are potentially different ways to setup routing.\nLet's assume the server has IP adresses 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1 for eth0 and wlan0.\n\n\n*\n\n*There are only the two local networks. There is no additional router that connects either network to the internet/a third network. The server you are setting up, is the only device to perform routing.\nSimply set the IP of the appropriate interface of the server as the default gateway on the clients. The effect is, that any package not destined for the local network will be forwarded to the server, who in turn will forward it to the other network.\n\n*You have a router that connects one of the networks to the internet. Usually a router provided by your ISP. Let's pretend that's network1 and call the router netgw-1. In that case, the clients will have set netgw-1 as their default-gw. If netgw-1 is capable, the best way to go would be to add an entry to its routing table in the gist of\n192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1\n\nHow to do this exactly depends on the device.\nThat way the clients won't need additional routes, but the packages destined for network2 are send via netgw-1 to server to network2.\nUnfortunately this will most likely not be possible, since the router will not allow manipulating its routing table. This leaves you with the option to add an entry to the routing table on each client.\nNote: How to make routes persistent depends on the clients method of network configuration (e.g NetworkManager or /etc/interfaces). \nBut for the purpose of testing, take a client on each network and set a route (on the client!).\nThe current routes can be listed via ip route show.\nsudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0\n\nThis sets a route to the network 192.168.2.0/24 using the router 192.168.1.1, sending out packages via the interface eth0. You will have to adapt the command, depending on which network the client is on, and the name of the  network interface.\nAfter that, it should be as simple as enabling IPv4 forwarding _on the server. When the option net.ipv4.ip_forward is enabled, the kernel will forward IP packages across the server's network interfaces.\nTo check the status of forwarding: sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward\nIf it is 0, enable it via\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\nNow try to ping a across the router. If it works as desired and you'd like to make the setting persistent on reboot, open /etc/sysctl.conf and set\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\nNote that you might want to setup package filters via iptables to forbid certain traffic, depending on your security needs. But that is a different topic.\nSetting up the machine as a NAT router requires setting up iptables to masquerade traffic, but as your question suggests you've already read howtos about that topic.\n", "Q: Cannot mount USB after I boot Kali on it I wanted to install Kali linux as second OS so I boot it on USB.

NM inserts that address if an only if it is configured to start an instance of the dnsmasq program to serve as a local forwarding nameserver. That dnsmasq instance listens for queries at address 127.0.1.1.\nIf you do not want to use a local forwarding nameserver then configure NetworkManager not to start a dnsmasq instance and not to insert that address. In /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf comment out the line dns=dnsmasq\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\n#dns=dnsmasq\n\nand restart the NetworkManager service.\nsudo restart network-manager\n\nIn this mode, NetworkManager updates /etc/resolv.conf (still via resolvconf) to include the nameserver addresses NetworkManager has for active connections.\nIf you want to disable the resolvconf mechanism for updating resolv.conf and just use a static resolv.conf file, do the following.\nsudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf  # Delete the symbolic link\nsudo nano /etc/resolv.conf   # Create static file\n\n# Content of static resolv.conf\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\n", "Q: Why are there broken packages while reinstalling without formatting original home directory?

Note: Doing something like echo nil -n nil will work and output nil -n nil, so if echo outputs everything, then why doesn't it output -n, it should output -n not doing nothing.\n\nA: By default echo appends a newline character to it's output, so if you issue echo without any parameters, the output is nothing, followed by a newline.\nThe -n option means 'do not output the trailing newline'. So when you issue echo -n it uses the -n as an option, and outputs nothing without a newline. This will leave no evidence of output on the display.\nIf you use a letter which is not a valid option for echo such as '-x' it will be printed to the screen, with a newline as normal. If you use -n within other input, it is not read as an option, so will print normally.\n\nA: To add to Arronical's answer, echo does not support --, which is the standard convention to declare\n\"This is end of options/flags, consider everything that follows as arguments.\"\nGNU echo can be made to output -n by using\necho -e \"\\e--n\"\n\nIn zsh, echo is a shell built in, and echo - -n does the job.\n", "Q: Laptop is Suddenly Off While Suspended I'm on a dual boot machine (Acer Aspire E1-572G) running Windows 7 SP1 64 bit and Linux Mint 17.2 64 bit.\nEverything is fine, but sometimes while my laptop is in sleep mode (suspended) it turns off, as if someone pushed the power button for several seconds.\nThis never happens on Windows 7, which indicates that I have no hardware problems. \nI use suspend very frequently, and a fix for this problem is a high priority.\nNOTE:  My UEFI is configured for legacy boot (BIOS). \nI had the same problem on this same setup, but on Ubuntu 14.04LTS.

I don't want to interrupt the processes, but leave them time to properly quit.\n\nSee also:\nHow do I kill processes in Ubuntu?\nIn System monitor, what is the difference between Kill Process and End Process?\nWhy does killall (sometimes?) needs to be applied twice?\n tl;dr \n\nA: The answer by @hvd is basically correct. To back that up even more, the init process will first send SIGTERM to processes when your are shutting down your computer, then after a delay will send SIGKILL if they have not already exited. Processes can't handle/ignore SIGKILL.\nTo give a bit more detail though, the real answer is that you have no way of knowing for sure that the program handles it. SIGTERM is the most usual signal to use for politely asking a program to quit, but all signal handling depends on the program doing something with the signal. \nTo put it a different way, based on the other answers, if you had a program written by @Jos or by @AlexGreg then they would presumably be handling SIGQUIT but possibly not SIGTERM, and hence sending SIGTERM would be less \"soft\" than SIGQUIT.\nI've written some code so you can play around with it yourself. Save the below as signal-test.c, then compile with\ngcc -o signal-test signal-test.c\n\nYou can then run it ./signal-test, and see what happens when you send different signals with killall -s <signal>.\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <signal.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint flag = 0;\n\nvoid handle_signal(int s)\n{\n    flag = s;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    signal(SIGTERM, handle_signal);\n    signal(SIGQUIT, handle_signal);\n\n    while(flag == 0){\n        sleep(1);\n    }\n    printf(\"flag is %d\\n\", flag);\n    return flag;\n}\n\nAs it stands, the code handles both SIGTERM and SIGQUIT gracefully. You could try commenting out the lines signal(SIG... (using a // at the start of the line) to remove the signal handler, then run and send the signals again. You should be able to see these different outputs:\n$ ./signal-test\nTerminated\n\n$ ./signal-test\nQuit (core dumped)\n\n$ ./signal-test\nflag is 15\n\n$ ./signal-test\nflag is 3\n\ndepending on whether you handle the signals or not.\nYou could also try ignoring the signals:\nsignal(SIGTERM, SIG_IGN);\n\nIf you do that then sending SIGTERM will do nothing, you'll have to use SIGKILL to end the process.\nMore details in man 7 signal. Note that using signal() in this way is considered non-portable - it's lots easier than the alternative though!\nOne other minor footnote - on Solaris killall attempts to kill all processes. All of them. If you run it as root then you may be surprised :)\n\nA: 1. `killall` already nice (SIGTERM)\nkillall by default sends SIGTERM. This is already the nice approach that leaves applications the chance to clean up after themselves. The \"go die already, right now!\" approach is to send a SIGKILL signal, which requires specifying that as an option to killall. From The GNU C Library: Termination Signals:\n\nMacro: int SIGTERM\n[...] It is the normal way to politely ask a program to terminate.\n\n\n2. System Monitor's \"End process\" equally nice (SIGTERM, too)\nYou link to a question about GNOME System Monitor. That does use SIGTERM for its \"End process\" action too (and I realise I am contradicting the answer to that question). You can find it in the source code to verify yourself:\ndata/menus.ui:\n<item>\n  <attribute name=\"label\" translatable=\"yes\">_End</attribute>\n  <attribute name=\"action\">win.send-signal-end</attribute>\n  <attribute name=\"accel\">&lt;Primary&gt;e</attribute>\n  <attribute name=\"target\" type=\"i\">15</attribute>\n</item>\n\nThe 15 here is the signal number. Signal 15 is SIGTERM. And System Monitor has used SIGTERM well before that other question was asked and answered.\n\nTechnical addendum (in response to a comment)\nLooking through the Github representation of git blame, here are the changes that have been made to how the signals are spelt out in the source code of GNOME System Monitor:\n383007f2 24 Jul 2013 Replaced duplicated code for sending signals with GAction parameters\n0e766b2d 18 Jul 2013 Port process popup menu to GAction\n97674c79 3 Oct 2012 Get rid of ProcData structure\n38c5296c 3 Jul 2011 Make indentation uniform across source files.\n\nNone of these changed from SIGQUIT to SIGTERM, and that last one was from before the linked question was asked.\n\nA: \"End all\" would be killall -s SIGQUIT [process name]. If you want a fancy solution, define alias endall='killall -s SIGQUIT'.\n", "Q: Windows UAC wont allow access to ubuntu folder? I have a web server set up on a secondary machine running Ubuntu.

Why does killall (sometimes?) need to be applied twice? Here's an example where a \"double\" killall is needed to end the process.\nWhen and why does a process needed to be killed \"twice\"? What happens under the bonnet?\n\nA: I am going to state a application-specific possibility.\nWhen you use killall program, a SIGTERM (signal 15) is sent to the program. The usual response to SIGTERM is that the program would exit gracefully.\nNow as the SIGTERM is catchable, a program can have a signal handler for SIGTERM that would do some task upon receiving the first SIGTERM (first killall) and return to a state where the second SIGTERM would just terminate it (default action). This is highly dependent on the developer of the program of course and not a general case.\n", "Q: Linux installation on a chromebook I have an Acer Chromebook C7. Intel processor. I am somewhat familiar with basic coding in the terminal and all that. I am not thrilled with Chrome OS, so I'd like a nice linux desktop/OS that I can run on it instead. A full OS would be great, but it would be nice if I could test out different options first. Regardless, I have looked everywhere and tried downloading a ton of different links and codes, installing to usb boot, etc. But I can't seem to get a recent Ubuntu with applications, internet, etc. Permissions or not being able to find the source or something always stops me from getting any release. How can I do it?\n\nA: You can test out different options best by using crouton -- you can easily uninstall it by powerwashing your chromebook so it's a rather low-risk option (provided you back up your data!).\nYou can install quite a few versions of ubuntu and have a nice choice of DEs (unity, xfce, kde etc--you can even install cinnamon if you're willing to go the extra mile).\nYou can also create multiple chroots and delete the ones you don't like! You can then decide if you want to go with chrubuntu or stick with crouton! In my experience crouton runs better than I thought it would and booting into ChromeOS first hasn't really been much of a hassle.\nThere's an extra option, GalliumOS (look up the wiki) that's a bit more complicated to install depending on the model of your chromebook. Exercise extra caution if you choose to follow this approach.\nHere's the 2016 guide to installing crouton.\n", "Q: EXT4-fs error on Ubuntu 15.04 crashing after installing an HDD for extra space, Kernel panic on live USB boot Earlier last week I went ahead and bought a 1TB HDD so I could store some extra files on my work machine.  Now I'm having problems with the system crashing.  The first time I got the following error messages on crash.  sdb1 is my SSD, which I use to boot Ubuntu, and sda1 is the new filesystem.\nEXT4-fs error (device sdb1): ext4_iget:4084: inode #4325442: comm (kill): bogus i_mode (0)\nAborting journal on device sdb1-8.\nEXT4-fs (sdb1): Remounting filesystem read-only\nEXT4-fs error (device sdb1): ext4_journal_check_start:56: Detected aborted journal\nEXT4-fs error (device sdb1): ext4_iget:4084: inode #4325442: comm (kill): bogus i_mode (0)\n\nSo I did some reading online about errors like this and I've been trying to boot up into a terminal, but half the time I can't even get there, the screen just goes black.  I read and followed a tutorial on adding a file-system in linux, I can't remember which one, but it seems I may have messed something up in doing so.\nSo once I boot into Ubuntu after emergency mode, I can usually stay on for about 2 minutes before it crashes.  I can't access any files or programs or it will crash immediately.  I can run some terminal commands from here, but I'm obviously going to have to do everything from emergency mode.\nAs per some instructions over on the Ubuntu forums I ran sudo ls -l findmnt -notarget /dev/sda1/lost+found for both sdb1 and sda1 and got total 0\nI also ran dmesg|grep -i fsck and this was the response\nsystemd[1]: Listening on fsck to fsckd communication Socket.\nsystemd[1]: Starting fsck to fsckd communication Socket.\nEXT4-fs (sdb1): warning: mounting fs with errors, running e2fsck is recommended\nEXT4-fs (sdb1): error count since last fsck: 101\n\nCan I get away with just formatting the HDD and hoping that solves it?  I don't really have any important files on there yet.\nUpdate\nAfter a ton of fiddling I managed to basically destroy my system.  I can still boot to the SSD, now indefinitely with several bugs and glitches, but cannot boot from a USB in order to reinstall Ubuntu.  I've disconnected all drives but every time I try to boot from a live usb I get the first part of the Ubuntu boot screen (the one with the keyboard and the little person) but quickly get a Kernel panic page.\nSo I guess I'm boned.  \nUpdate 2\nWith the way my USB drives were behaving properly on my laptop and home machine, I'm convinced it's something to do with my motherboard/processor at this point.  They're pretty old (a P5QL pro) and from all the toiling I did yesterday, it seems apparent that it is neither the SSD or the HDD on my work machine.  It's also probably important to note that this is a Samsung Evo which I bought about 2 months ago - I know that doesn't make it immune to hardware failure, but it does make it seem much less likely.\nNevertheless, I ran smartctl on my SSD, which I was able to reformat, install Ubuntu onto and boot from, and got the following.\n=== START OF INFORMATION SECTION ===\nDevice Model:     Samsung SSD 850 EVO 120GB\nSerial Number:    S21TNSAG424016R\nLU WWN Device Id: 5 002538 da028f444\nFirmware Version: EMT01B6Q\nUser Capacity:    120,034,123,776 bytes [120 GB]\nSector Size:      512 bytes logical/physical\nRotation Rate:    Solid State Device\nDevice is:        Not in smartctl database [for details use: -P showall]\nATA Version is:   ACS-2, ATA8-ACS T13/1699-D revision 4c\nSATA Version is:  SATA 3.1, 6.0 Gb/s (current: 6.0 Gb/s)\nLocal Time is:    Tue Sep 22 08:32:04 2015 EDT\nSMART support is: Available - device has SMART capability.\nSMART support is: Disabled\n\nSo although I have formatted both drives and reinstalled Ubuntu on the SSD (which I tested vigorously on my home PC) I'm still getting crashes.  It seems rather obvious that this has to do with either my CPU, motherboard, or GPU.

To get the OpenCL drivers working on a computer with an AMD APU/GPU you simply need to install the fglrx driver from the software center. To test that its working and to write code you may also want the AMD APP SDK.\nI used version 3.0 of the SDK from the AMD site.\nThe install guide is here.\nOnce you have it you can follow their programming guide.\nHere is one of the early examples modified to simply print out the number of compute units on your machines GPU:\n            //\n            // Copyright (c) 2010 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Supposedly it can now do partial/selective sync. (see Is there a Google Drive client available?)\nBut something that is not revealed in the manpage is how to do this, other than using the -s switch and manually syncing individual folders. I remember reading about a .exclude file where supposedly you list the files you want ignored in a sync, but this is cumbersome to maintain, especially if you have a Google Drive as big as mine.\nDoes anyone know how to format .exclude, and if it can use wildcards, e.g. something like this:\n\\# Exclude the following:\n/My Drive/Photos/big/*\n./Google Photos/*.jpg\n\nEdit: Just got a reply from the developer on GitHub, who says there is no .exclude file, but he is working on something like this. Now I am doubly confused because I don't know where I read about it, but I know I'm not dreaming!\n\nA: Also interested & accidentally found a workaround, steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*install grive2\n\n*authenticate and start full sync by grive -a in the ~/grive folder\n\n*wait till files in Google Drive root folder will be downloaded and break it when syncing first subfolder\n\n*create new subfolder such as ~/grive/myfiles and put some files here\n\n*start single folder sync by grive -s ~/grive/myfiles\n\n*repeat step 5 when you want to sync changes in myfiles folder\n\n\nHTH\n\nA: I don't believe that starting a full sync is required as mentioned by @mschanya. It appears that since Grive2 v0.4.0 partial sync is supported at the folder level with the command grive -s subdir\nIt also seems that since Grive2 v0.4.2 there is an option to exclude files by perl regexp with the switch --ignore arg  {Perl RegExp to ignore files (matched against relative paths, remembered for next runs)}.\nGithub address is here\nSource:http://yourcmc.ru/wiki/Grive2#Syncs\n", "Q: \"apt-get install grub\" wants to install packages although the GRUB bootmenu works? Recently I made a fresh install of Ubuntu, and through some error, became very frustrated. Grub and 15.04 just don't seem to work well together. However, that is not exactly my question. I made the install finally, and when I booted, the grub menu obviously came up, but then when I got into my terminal to install some proprietary drivers, I did sudo apt-get install grub just to make sure everything was good. Instead of telling me that Grub was already installed it said 6 new packages would be installed. So here's the question. If the grub menu came up, and grub apparently wasn't installed, which side is wrong?\n\nA: sudo apt-get install grub is a wrong command to run.\nIt installs legacy version of grub and removes grub-pc or grub-efi.\nYou can check /var/log/apt/history.log and revert these changes.\n\nA: The installation of the package grub (GRand Unified Bootloader (Legacy version)) would not only install a deprecated version, but also remove the correct version.\nYou can see this in the sample output\n\n% sudo -s apt-get install grub\n[sudo] password for aboettger: \nReading package lists...

I want to explicitly load a module (say, netconsole) during the initrd stage, similarly to /etc/modules in the main system startup procedure.\nFirst, I checked that the initrd in my system already contains the wanted module (see Appendix).\nI have looked into /initrd.img (which is a compressed cpio archive, so to have a quick look into it, I have done zcat /initrd.img > initrd.cpio and gone inside it with mc). I have looked for any invocations of modprobe among the scripts, and have figured out that the modules listed in /conf/modules (/ is initrd's root here) get automatically loaded by the load_modules() function from /scripts/functions (called by /init).\nBut what would be the standard tool in the Ubuntu system to update /conf/modules of the initrd?\n(BTW, during my study of the code of the Ubuntu's initrd, I noticed that there is some special support for netconsole in the /init script, which I might make work for my needs, but anyway ,my question is more general, concerning any other custom module.)\nAppendix\nAs I said above: first, I checked that the initrd in my system already contains the wanted module (namely, netconsole).

My hunch is that your computer lacks the keys needed to boot Ubuntu; or possibly there's a bug involved, probably in your EFI's Secure Boot implementation. (I've seen some computers refuse signed copies of Shim, which is the tool that Ubuntu uses as a Secure Boot solution.) It could also be that you've got some odd mixture of signed and unsigned copies of GRUB.\nThe easiest workaround is to disable Secure Boot. Unfortunately, details of how to do this vary from one computer to another. This page of mine shows four examples of how to do it, but I've heard descriptions of some that vary significantly from any of mine.\n", "Q: How to upload many images to Google Photo?

Use fe Overgrive to sync the specific folder to Google Drive. You temporarily might have to pay for extra space in GD. Then turn on the option to show the pictures in GP from the GD (if you hadn't already). When all the pictures show in GP you can remove the folder from your GD and the pictures will still show in GP (though in my case not original quality, but I didn't want that anyway). And cancel the extra space in the cloud.\nPS. For using a network folder. Maybe it is possible to create a local folder of the network in the GD folder of Overgrive. But saw some worries on this topic. Didn't try it yet.\nPS2. Overgrive is/was planning to create a solution for syncing pictures to GP. Don't know the status of that to be clear.\nPS3. After uploading the database I expect to use auto upload from the devices themselves. But if the database has evolved, the new folders can maybe also be uploaded the same way as mentioned in the beginning.\nPS4. Also noticed Insync software which should also work in Ubuntu. Haven't tried that one yet.\n\nA: EDIT\nUnfortunately this doesn't work. I don't know whether it never worked and I just missed to notice or it stopped working at some point.

In the first days it was very fast compared to windows. However it goes slower by time. It takes more than 1 minute to see the desktop. Chrome takes around 30 seconds for cold start. Atom editor is also same. Also it would take around 4-5 seconds for ubuntu to shut down. Now it takes around 15 seconds. Sometimes it doesn't shutdown at all. It just shows the closing screen and stays in that state indefinitely.\nIt seems that the new Windows 10 is much more faster than ubuntu. How can I speed up my ubuntu? And why ubuntu isn't faster than windows anymore? I think linux should also use some kind of hibernation like windows do.\nEdit: my cpu is intel i7 2.2 GHz. It has turbo mode but afaik linux cannot use that mode. I have 8 GB ram.

I've tried with both persistent memory (1gb) and without. It's worth mentioning I've done this before with the same pen drive and the same laptop, the only difference being that I now got a SSD (Crucial BX100), which is why I'm reinstalling - however, I can't even load it live, so I assume it's not the SSD's fault either.\nSo, I tried using unetbootin instead of Universal USB Installer, and it's now giving me a different error*:\n(initramfs) unable to find a live medium containing a live file system\n*actually I'm not sure when this error showed up, after re-writing the .iso to the flash drive, now it just hangs after recognizing the USBs I have on, more specifically, hangs indefinitely after recognizing my webcam.

The new ListItem has the ability to do live drag-and-drop reorderings.  When one is in progress, how do you detect its end?\nThe ListItem had the ViewItems.onDragUpdated signal, which should fire for three types of events: Started, Moving, and Dropped.  When all the Moving events are accepted, as they are in a live drag, no Dropped event is generated at the end.  Is there a way to force this to happen?  Or is there another way to tell when the user has dropped the item?\n\nA: The event is not triggered as the from and to indices are the same. When in live mode, you must update your model on each move, as that is the way to tell the ListView behind that your element ordering is changed. It is not expected to fire any event as long as the from and to indices are having the same value, which is the case in Dropped state when on live mode. Of course, Dropped may be a special case, which should be emitted never the less the two indices are the same.\n", "Q: How change From field in Postfix I have own server and installed Postfix.

How I can change current \"From\" field to this:\nUsername <email1@example.com>?\n\nA: I think this may depend on how you send email (what client you are using). If you're sending it from command line using mail or mailx you can use -r and append the information like so:\nmail -s \"Subject\" -r \"Username <email@example.com>\" recipient\n\nDon't forget to put the part past -r in double quotes.\n", "Q: How do you make the background of a dragged ListItem opaque? The new ListItem has drag-and-drop capability built-in.  By default, though, dragged items have a transparent background, which looks awful.

But I've been unable to find a way to programmatically match the color used as the background of the ListView.  Neither the UbuntuColors object nor the Theme object seem to have this color defined.  Is there someway I can get this color and use it for the background of the ListItems?  Or, is there a better way to attack this problem?\n\nA: You can colorise your ListItems the way you like even while dragging. UbuntuColors and Theme.Palette has colors the toolkit is using, if you need others you should use custom values. The background of the ListView is transparent, so the ListItem, so you should look for the colors your item is using hosting your ListView. If that's the Page/MainView, you'll see theme.palette.normal.background palette color in use.\n", "Q: DVD's still not working Have installed the libraries suggested for getting encrypted DVD's to play but its still not happening.

Is this more easily done if the newer version exists in more recent Ubuntu releases? \n\nA: The broad answer to your question is no. As A.B. wrote in the answer you reference, installing software versions ahead of the official repositories will mostly likely to result in unmet dependencies, breaking things along the way.\nThere are two basic ways to upgrade software relative to the versions provided in the official repositories (none of them automatic):\n\n\n*\n\n*Compile the software yourself (and all its dependencies).\n\n*Install the software from a third party PPA that may provide a more recent version.\nNote that in both cases however, it is very possible this software becomes unusable after a system upgrade (e.g. from 14.04 to 15.04).\n", "Q: Problems installing Openstack with Landscape We've been trying to install Openstack via MAAS / JuJu / Landscape.

I want to build a server with two NICs that I can deploy between a test machine and its uplink so I can reduce the network speed for testing some other software.  I have read this routing post, how to set up a router and How do I limit internet bandwidth.  I want this server to be transparent on the network; however, not a router.\n\nA: I think it is possible with ebtables, see:\nhttp://ebtables.netfilter.org/examples/example5.html\nHowever you might have trouble getting the setup to be realistic (i.e. to behave like a network link that offers a rate equal to your throughput cap). This really depends on your requirements.\nThe average throughput will indeed be capped if you measure it over long periods (e.g. seconds), but if you do throttling in software the machine might process packets in bursts (meaning that you will have a processing delay a.k.a latency for each packet, and this delay might vary wildly between different packets). The effect is that for short time scales your throughput will be sometimes much higher than the cap, for others much lower. Only the averaged throughput over long periods will match the cap.\nIt is possible to lower the processing delay with some crazy optimizations, similar to those used in high-frequency trading, but it is very difficult and you will have to buy expensive hardware (e.g. racked servers) to get them working reliably.\nIf I were you, instead of spending money on the server, I would get a cheap managed switch (~$100). For instance SG-200s support rate limiting, see \"Traffic Shaping\" in the manual at page 174 https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/csbss/sg200/administration_guide/78-19562.pdf These switches support rate limiting implemented in hardware and ideally should introduce a packet processing delay that is much smaller than what you get from a software box emulating the switch. You can also rest assured that it works correctly; anything you try to emulate in software needs to be tested and benchmarked carefully.\nIf you have very strict requirements, you might want to know that the cheap switches usually implement packet queuing using a method called WRR (weighted round robin). There is a more accurate rate limiting method called SRR (shaped round robin), for which the delay variations are even lower; however the price of those switches (certain Catalyst models) is usually above $1-2,000 because the chips run at a much higher clock frequency. Also, the fact that you have only one class of traffic might reduce the gap between them. The implementation difference between WRR and SRR is described here http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-3560-e-series-switches/prod_qas0900aecd805bacc7.html (see Q. What is the difference between WRR and SRR in shared mode?)\n(Of course there are other brands/models of managed switches that offer rate limiting; I'm not promoting anything, I'm just telling you about these because that's what I know about. Other brands/models most likely implement very similar mechanisms for rate limiting that might work just fine :) ).\n", "Q: Why are the common default shortcuts in terminal all use shift? Like Ctrl + shift + C for copy, Ctrl + shift + V for paste ... It's annoying since they're universal shortcuts, they shouldn't be different from everywhere else, but I'm guessing there was good reasons for this choice.\nCould it cause issues to remove the Shift in those shortcuts ?\nEDIT: After changing the shortcut in Ubuntu's terminal to Ctrl + C, programs termination is now automatically configured to use Ctrl + shift + C. This OS is pretty smart!\n\nA: The control keys are by default the terminal settings. Every application you run can change these to their liking (e.g. ^C has no effect in nano)\nYou can list the settings using stty -a. You can for instance change the interrupt, which normally is ctrl+c to ctrl+a using: stty intr ^A\nIf you are running the default Ubuntu terminal, you can also change the key-binding in menu Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts....   \nThere you will see that copy is mapped to ctrl+Shift+c.

just need to pay attention to the library link order. In particular, since objects in your cv_version.c translation unit depend on objects in the OpenCV library, it must come ahead of the pkg-config --libs opencv on your command line, e.g.\ngcc -v `pkg-config --cflags opencv` cv_version.c `pkg-config --libs opencv` -lm -ocv_version\n\nThe gcc manual page Options for Linking mentsions this explicitly:\n\n-llibrary\n\n-l library\nSearch the library named library when linking. (The second alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)\nIt makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they are specified. Thus, ‘foo.o -lz bar.o’ searches library ‘z’ after file foo.o but before bar.o. If bar.o refers to functions in ‘z’, those functions may not be loaded.\n\n", "Q: Automatically connect to wifi network? I'm using an ODROID C1+ and need to connect to a wireless network.

In order to assist them, because they are parents, I set up VNC / Desktop Sharing (using the Desktop Sharing GUI) with \"Allow others to view...\" and \"You must confirm access...\" and forwarded the relevant ports through their access point, and I have a VNC client on my computer.\nThe server computer has three users. I've made the Desktop Sharing settings in each user's profile.\nThe problem is that when I try to connect the VNC, it always directs the VNC request to a certain user, say fred. If a different user is logged in, nothing happens - the message requesting access pops up on fred's desktop, which is inactive, not on the desktop of the active user (so if we switch to fred's login, the access window is there). So it works fine for fred, but not for anyone else. I'm not sure if it matters whether fred is logged in, or if there is some other reason it prefers fred. They tend to switch users, usually leaving the other users logged in in the background.\nAny idea how I can direct my VNC actions to certain users, or to whichever one is active? My goal is to use it to assist the person who is currently at the terminal.\nEDIT: It depends on which users are logged in. If only one user is logged in, it goes to that person. If there are multiple, it appears to go to whichever was logged in first. So there's a workaround; make sure only one user is logged in. But that's pretty lame. Still investigating...\n\nA: Found my own answer, at least one answer. I was able to accomplish it by assigning each user a different port; then the request goes to the correct user.\nInstall dconf-tools with\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nRun the dconf Editor (from Dash) and then surf to:\norg / gnome / desktop / remote-access\n\nSet the \"use-alternative-port\" to checked, and set the 'alternative-port' to some other number. I used incrementing numbers starting with 5901 for the first user, 5902 for the second, etc.\nDo this for each user, and take note of their port numbers. Then when you want to access this user's screen, override the default port when connecting with the client (usually by appending ':5901' or so to the IP address).\n", "Q: how to find other machines which are connected same network I tried to find all machines which are connected my modem. I tried 192.168.x.0/24 command on gnome-terminal but it couldn't find any.

It does on my system anyway, as does arp-scan as suggested by Adonis. If, however, you don't want to install any tools, you could use a brute approach and just ping everything:\nfor i in 192.168.1.{1..100}; do \n    ping -w 1 -c 1 $i >/dev/null && echo \"$i is up\"; \ndone\n\nThe command above will ping every IP between 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.100. If a host is pingable (if it is connected), it will print the host's name. \nHowever, this will be slow and cumbersome and is not really a good solution. Use arp-scan or nmap as you did instead. \n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on pre-made hard drive partition mac I am having trouble installing Ubuntu on a partition on my hard drive, and none of the other similar questions helped me.\nI have a partition set up for Ubuntu, and also a 5 gigabyte transfer partition.\nI have a disk with the Ubuntu installer on it (it works).\nI am lost using the actual installer of Ubuntu, where it asks you to wipe the drive (or something like a custom partition scheme which is what I want).\nI have data on the other partitions on my hard drive that I would not like to lose, and I would like to keep the partitioning scheme I am using.\nMy hard drive is a 2t external one.\nThe partitions are as follows: 950gb, 950gb, 50gb, 45gb(where I want Ubuntu), 5gb(for the transfer)\nAny suggestions? (I am a Ubuntu noob so detail would be appreciated.)\n\nA: Linux distros require 2 partitions; 1 for / (known as root-equiv of c:\\ in windows) and a swap partition (virtual memory in windows). If memory correctly serves, the installation should take care of that for you within the partition that you choose to install into. It is also necessary to choose a file system type that Linux will work with (older ext2, ext3, reiserfs. I currently installed using ext4).\nBut I wonder if you are having a problem installing to a partition on an external HD. There might be a way to check; when installation begins, and you are in the area where partition selection takes place, there is a way to choose 'manually configure partitions'. After choosing that, there should\nbe a list of partitions from which to choose. If so, choose the space where you wish ubuntu to reside, and create your / and swap partitions within that space. Install should carry on fine from this point. \nIf you do not see a list of partitions, then your external HD is not being seen, and that is almost certainly a situation wherein USB is not setup yet.\n                       Hope this helps  Craig\nIf you are seeing partitions, then remember that you DO NOT want to choose the Windows Partition (should be filesystem NTFS). Click on the partition that you want to be /(root), set up the file system choice (EXT4?), pick another partition for your swap, and click 'save changes'. Ubuntu will then install per your choices, and should automatically set up GRUB for dual booting. Hope this clarifies and gets you on your way  Craig \n", "Q: Bluetooth headset with poor sound quality on Ubuntu I've bought a Philips SHB4000 headset (phone+mic) wireless (bluetooth) and It has a good quality when I pair it with my phone or PC Windows but when I pair it with the same PC on Ubuntu (14.10 64 bits) the sound quality goes down.\nI've been googling about but I haven't found any convincing answer.\nTks in advance!\n....\n\nA: The solution which worked for me is\nhere\nbasically it says to do:\n$sudo apt install pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils pavucontrol pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\n\nthen add:\n[General]\nEnable=Source,Sink,Media,Socket\n\nto /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf and run:\nsudo service bluetooth restart\n\nThen reconnect your headphones and it should work. It did for me!\n\nA: Here is the solution that worked for me on Debian 9 (menu impossible to apply)\nImportant: you will have to restart bluetooth before each reconnection !\nSource: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/415928/325467\n\nI am using a SoundBuds Curve headset in Debian 9, \nand have had the same problem, I was\nunable to switch from the HSP/HFP profile to the A2DP profile.\nWhat fixed the issue for me, was editing /etc/bluetooth/main.conf\nsudo nano /etc/bluetooth/main.conf\n\nFirst add the following lines under the [General] tag (copied from audio.conf, I found searching for a solution):\n# Automatically connect both A2DP and HFP/HSP profiles for incoming\n# connections. Some headsets that support both profiles will only connect the\n# other one automatically so the default setting of true is usually a good\n# idea.\nAutoConnect=true\n\nNext you must enable support for multiple profiles (a few lines below) just uncomment and set value to multiple\nMultiProfile = multiple\n\nThen restart bluetooth service\nsudo systemctl restart bluetooth \n\nImportant: you will have to restart bluetooth before each reconnection !\n\nA: I had to do both setting the main.conf to multiple profiles then remove the headphones and add them back and then they defaulted to High Fidelity.\n\nA: May be someone will find this helpful: Don't try to switch to A2DP while some app is playing sound. You need to disable all sound outputs first, then disconnect, connect, switch to A2DP, then select A2DP device as target.\n\nA: Go into sound settings, then see what the SHB4000 is using. If it uses HSP/HFP change to A2DP.\n\n\nA: For those experiencing this with Ubuntu 16.04, and switching to A2DP only worked once, I had to disconnect, forget the device, reconnect, switch to A2DP, for it to start working again.\n(Wanted to post this as a comment, but n00b-ness prevents this)\n\nA: For Ubuntu 20.04 only (seems to be fixed in 21.04)\nFor anyone, that uses the Microphone of their Headset with Ubuntu and complain about bad sound and speech quality:\nThere is a new update in Mai 2021:\nWith this commit, HFP can be enabled which supports wideband audio-speech via bluetooth.\nI was able to improve my microphone quality alot and my colleagues actually can understand me now and I dont sound like talking with an old phone.\nTested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Sony 1000-mx3\nFor this to work you need to clone the latest pulseaudio master from their git repository by:\ngit clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio.git\n\nCompile and install via\nmeson build\nsudo ninja -C build install\nsudo ldconfig\n\nTaken from the docs of pulseaudio\nYou might have to install source-dependencies for the compilation to work. For this goto open Software-Settings with software-properties-gtk and enable source. Then install the build-dependencies with sudo apt-get build-dep pulseaudio\nRestart. Then, when you open your Sound-Settings you are able to choose the HFP-Profile, which enables much better sound-quality for VOIP. For best music-quality, still better switch to A2DP again, however, this one does not support microphone usage.\n\nA: So, I recently bought the JBL 700BT Headphones. I was getting muffled voice upon connecting with Ubuntu 20.04. Here's what I did to fix it:\n1> sudo apt install pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils pavucontrol pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\nIt turns out I didn't have all of them.\n2>Then edit the /etc/bluetooth/main.conf\nChange MultiProfile to multiple then,\nMultiProfile = multiple\n3> sudo systemctl restart bluetooth\nThis fixed it for me. Hoping someone finds this helpful.\n\nA: I am running Ubuntu 16.04 and experienced the same problem with my JBL E65BTNC headphones where changing to A2DP didn't stick. I used most of @56ka's answer but I didn't need the part where you need to set:\nMultiProfile = multiple\n\nIn fact, when I did this, neither A2DP nor HSP/HFP was available. The device was listed as an output device but the sound did not come through (i.e. when I tried to test the device in Sound Settings, nothing happened). When I commented the MultiProfile option out and restarted the bluetooth service, everything worked.  \n\nA: It should works without messing with the system configuration.\nYour device is likely taken as a headset unit for some reasons.\nTo switch to High Fidelity, install pavucontrol if not done already.\nsudo apt install pavucontrol\n\nConnect your bluetooth device.\nGo to pavucontrol, «configuration» tab, where you can select a profile for your output device, choose AD2P\n\n*\n\n*High Fidelity Playback (AD2P Sink)\n\n*Headset Head Unit (HSP/HFP)\n\nA: Something to check, I had Over-Amplification enabled in the sound settings which drastically affected the sound quality.\n\nA: I had the same issue, using Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS\nWhenever I connected my wireless earbuds I got static distorted sound\nso I installed PulseAudio\nsudo apt install pavucontrol\nopened it and changed the Codec of my connected device\n\nthat seemed to do the trick!\n", "Q: How do I get rid of a ghost printer in Gnome? When I try to print from a Gnome application, the print dialog has non-functional printer listed.   It is called \"duerqxesz5090 -- Basement Utility Room -- Rejecting Jobs\".  Here is a screenshot of the Gnome print dialog box:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If I try to select that printer, the application will freeze for minutes or even crash.\n\n*I only get this with Gnome programs (such as gedit or glabels), but not with firefox or libreoffice \n\n*It is possible that it is the remnants of an old printer I did have installed at some point.   I did have a printer installed in the basement utility room.\n\n*I'm not using Gnome (I'm using xfce), but I have used Gnome in the past.\n\n*My Ubuntu version is Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid)\n\n*CUPS doesn't know anything about this ghost printer: \n\n*system-config-printer doesn't know anything about this printer: \nHow can I find out where this non-existent printer is listed on my system and remove it?\nI've tried searching for it in various places, but none of these return any results:\n\n\n*\n\n*dconf dump / | grep duerqx\n\n*sudo grep -r duerqx /etc/\n\n*gsettings list-recursively | grep duerqx\n\nA: It turns out that this printer isn't installed anywhere on my system.   This is Gnome auto-discovering my Brother laser printer (the one that is installed as HL4570CDW).   So it ends up that the same printer shows up twice on the list (but only once functionally.)\nI discovered this because I noticed that my printer's administration web interface said that the printer was located in the \"Basement Utility Room\" which exactly matches what the Gnome programs were saying.   I figured out how to change that setting.  Once I updated the printer to say it was in the \"Office (1st Floor)\", the dialog immediatly changed to say so as well:\n\nIf I unplug my printer from the network and try to print from a Gnome application, the \"ghost printer\" no longer appears.   If I plug the printer back in and try to print it re-appears on the list.\nI went into the printer configuration and disabled network services one at a time until I found the one that was causing the printer to magically appear (although non-functional.)   The culprit is IPP.   If I disable IPP services on the printer (and reboot it), then I no longer get the ghost printer even when the printer is on and connected to the network.\n\nWhen IPP is disabled, you can still install the printer as LPD or raw socket.  However, IPP may be important for printing from other platforms such as Windows and Mac.\nIn the end it appears to be a bug that a printer discovered via IPP is non-functional.\n\nTo stop programs from showing auto-discovered printers in the print dialog, you need to reconfigure the avahi  daemon service as detailed in this answer to How do I disable automatic remote printer installation?:\n\nedit /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf and in the [server] section, add enable-dbus=no  then restart the avahi-daemon service: sudo service avahi-daemon restart\n\nOnce I configure avahi like this, I no longer see this ghost printer even when the printer is available with IPP.\n\nA: I had a similar problem:\n\nThe bottom printer is from an older installation.

My problem is that screen brightness automatically changes depending on content. This means that the screen gets brighter when the contents are white (for example when I open my browser) and it gets dimmer when the contents are dark (for example when I open the terminal). This can easily be seen when I open a white window and a black window and I proceed to move the black window in and out of the screen, so the brightness constantly changes.\nI have done a fair amount of research, and the issue seems to have something to do with the power saving feature of the graphics card. This issue seems to be resolved in windows environments, but I have not found a solution for Ubuntu.\nThis issue appears only when I run the laptop on battery, and disappears as soon as I plug it in. This probably means it has something to do with power saving.\nThe graphics used is shown as Intel Haswell Mobile in \"About this Computer\". So I think it doesn't have a dedicated GPU.\nAll in all, the constant brightness adjustment is quite annoying, to the point that I have to plug my machine in in order to use it for extended periods of time.\nThis question has been asked before here about 8 months ago with no solution.

My original has Windows 10 (previously 8/8.1), and I installed Ubuntu 15.04 on my second one (after upgrading to 10). It installed fine and I can run it, but here's the problem: I can only to launch Ubuntu through UEFI mode. Through the boot from device option. I have disabled secure boot and quick boot through my BIOS and I have tried using EasyBSD, but neither seem to work. I would very much like to have the option to boot into either upon start up, is there something I am missing? \n\nA: Switching boot modes (BIOS vs. EFI) is a bit awkward with most computers, and there's seldom a real need to do is. When there is such a need, it's to support OSes that require different boot modes -- for instance, OS X (EFI) and Windows XP (BIOS) on a Mac. Macs can handle this a bit more seamlessly than PCs, but they typically require an ugly and dangerous hybrid MBR to do the job. That's going off on a side track, though....\nIn terms of Ubuntu, the only reasons I can think of for booting in both BIOS and EFI modes have to do with developers working on boot issues and individuals wanting to learn about the boot modes. In both cases, IMHO using installations in virtual machines is likely to be a better option, since the installations will be closer to the relevant standard setups.\nIf you really must do it on a real machine, you'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*At least one disk partitioned with the GUID Partition Table (GPT).\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have two disks, the second can use the older Master Boot Record (MBR) system.\n\n*MBR can be used for EFI-mode booting, but some EFIs react badly to it and the Ubuntu installer will (IIRC) refuse to install in EFI mode to an MBR disk, so as a practical matter MBR is a bad choice for EFI-mode booting. GPT, OTOH, can be used in both modes, although it sometimes causes problems in BIOS mode.\n\n\n*Assuming a 1-disk GPT setup and GRUB as the BIOS-mode boot loader, the GPT disk must contain a ~1MiB BIOS Boot Partition to handle BIOS-mode booting.\n\n*The disk must have an EFI System Partition (ESP) to hold the EFI boot loader.\n\n\nYou can install in either BIOS mode or EFI mode, which will install the version of GRUB for that boot mode. After installation, you'll need to install the boot loader for the other boot mode. Doing this using APT will be tricky at best, since the EFI-mode and BIOS-mode GRUB packages are mutually exclusive; installing one will remove the other. Thus, you'll need to install one package in some way other than APT.\nAlternatively, you can move away from GRUB for one boot loader. One particularly good choice is my rEFInd boot manager. rEFInd is an EFI-mode boot manager that has the ability to shift from EFI-mode to BIOS-mode booting. That feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled by uncommenting the scanfor line in refind.conf and ensuring that hdbios is among the options. When so configured, rEFInd will enable directly booting Linux kernels in EFI mode (without using GRUB) or switching to BIOS mode to boot via your BIOS-mode GRUB (or other BIOS-mode boot loader). Note, however, that this procedure doesn't work on all computers; some lack the necessary support.\nIf you don't use rEFInd, you'll have to use your computer's built-in boot manager to switch boot modes. This can often be done by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key at boot time, but details vary greatly from one computer to another. Using this feature will require both a BIOS-mode GRUB and an EFI-mode boot loader be installed.\nOverall, setting everything up correctly is likely to be a pain, and the configuration will be more delicate than a more conventional single-mode boot. Using the built-in EFI boot manager can be a nuisance, but rEFInd can help with that a bit.\n", "Q: Auto-off screen only on battery power This has been asked many times, but never answered.\n14.04\nCurrently there is a function to automatically switch off the screen after the computer has been idle for x minutes.\nThis setting will apply equally whether the computer is running on battery or is plugged in.\nA lot of people will want to have this setting only apply when the computer is running on battery.\nIs there any way to set this setting separately depending on whether the computer is on battery power or plugged in?\n\nA: According to this answer in  How to stop automatic brightness change while on battery?, there are two settings available through dconf-editor (accessible by installing dconf-tools):\n\n\n*\n\n*idle-dim-ac\n\n*idle-dim-battery\n\n\nSeparately setting these values should allow the idle to only occur when on battery, rather than on AC.\nNote: From comments on the answer, these options were not available in 14.04 at the time, but this may have been fixed.\nAlternatively (from Terminal command for checking/unchecking “Dim screen to save power”?), you could write a script to enable/disable the option automatically if your computer changes from battery to AC or vice-versa (script copied ad verbatim from original answer):\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true\ndo\n    if on_ac_power; then\n        gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-dim true\n    else\n        gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-dim false\n    fi\n    sleep 60   # check the state in each 60 seconds\ndone\n\nSave the script.ex: dimscreen.sh and run it by typing sh /path/to/dimscreen.sh in Terminal.\n\nA: As of GNOME 3.22, you can set two keys in dconf-editor:\norg.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power.sleep-inactive-ac-type\norg.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power.sleep-inactive-battery-type\n\nYou can set the first one to 'nothing' and the second one to 'blank'.\n", "Q: Opera doesn't open links in other applications Problem\nWhenever I click a link in an email from Thunderbird (or any non-browser application), Opera (which is my default browser) will open a new window to speed dial but not navigate to the address.

I would like to install the same version on the empty harddrive but without rebooting (many things running right now).  Is there a package that can be installed that will install Ubuntu on another harddrive?  I would like to avoid this long procedure for 12.04 (I am installing 14.04.3) described by an answer here and do it direct without setting up a virtual machine as suggested by the other answer there.\n\nA: You can clone the drive you are using onto the other one.  It takes a long time possibly a day or two if you have a large drive but it is very simple to do.  The procedure assumes the hardware is very similar or in the best case the same. \nYou most likely have two drives listed in your /dev directory.  This can change depending on hardware but /dev/sda is the most common.  If you look there is probably a /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 or more /dev/sda# devices.  These are your partitions on the drive.  Then if the other drive is empty you will have a /dev/sdb but no /dev/sdb# devices.  It's critical that you understand which drive is which since this procedure will copy one drive to the other and doing it backwards will destroy all your data.  With all changes to file systems I suggest you backup your data before you start.   \nFor this example I'm going to assume /dev/sda is your primary drive and /dev/sdb is the second drive you want Ubuntu on.   You can use a tool called dd to copy the drive byte for byte.\nBasic format is this: dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=2M\n\"if\" is your input file \n\"of\" is your output file and what you will over write \n\"bs\" is block size.  Default is 512 but you can speed it up by increasing it.  I usually use 2M.  \nThe command will have no output till it's done but your hard drive will start spinning at near max until it's done.   After wards you should be able to swap the secondary drive into the primary drive's place and boot.

It will show you in nice pie slices, what files take up most of your disk space and from there you can decide what to remove. \n\nA: Cleaning up with ubuntu-tweak as @jos suggests is certainly a good idea and you should do it! That way you can get rid of for example old kernels and their headers that accumulate over time.\nWhat @mikewhatever points out in the comment is nevertheless true. We can't possibly tell what is clogging up the root partition. Could be installed programs or large files in your home directory like videos.\nYou can find out how much space the contents of a directory is taking with \nfind / -type d -maxdepth 1 -exec du -sh '{}' 2>/dev/null \\;\n\nThe find-part will return all directories in / and execute disk-usage du on each, printing the amount of space occupied by that directory. This way you'll get an overview where the largest files reside. Replace / in the command by any directory you'd like to look into.\nAlternatively you could also list all files and their size above a certain size\nfind / -type f -size +100M -exec du -h '{}' 2>/dev/null \\;\n\nfor example will find all files on the root filesystem that are at least 100MB in size.\nDepending on what you find, the actions to take range from deleting unused large files in your home directory to uninstalling large packages that are not needed anymore. \nAs an alternative you could always re-size the disk file in VirtualBox, boot the VM from a Live image and use e.g GParted to enlarge the root partition. Make sure to make a backup or snapshot of the VM first!\n", "Q: changes to /etc/network/interfaces not working?

I had Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed on the same physical drive (windows partitions first). Windows used UEFI to boot while Ubuntu not. It means that in order to boot into Ubuntu I had to pick up BIOS boot menu and pick non-UEFI device with Ubuntu (UEFI respectively for Windows). This worked perfectly fine for me, Ubuntu grub knew nothing about Windows installation nor Windows about Ubuntu.\nSituation: I accepted Windows 10 upgrade, which added some partition before my Ubuntu partitions. Windows is still booting fine with UEFI, but Ubuntu enters Grub rescue mode on booting:\nerror: no such partition.\nEntering rescue mode...\ngrub rescue>\n\nFrom this point, I managed to start Ubuntu manually by typing\nset prefix=(hd0,gpt5)/boot/grub\nset root=(hd0,gpt5)\ninsmod normal\nnormal\n\nas (hd0,gpt5) is my /boot containing partition (this helped Windows 10 upgrade led to grub rescue)\nQuestion: How to make this prefix/root change permanent? I followed this http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd and tried to reinstall grub, but got the following:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nInstalling for i386-pc platform.\ngrub-install: warning: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible.\ngrub-install: warning: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can only be installed in this setup by using blocklists.  However, blocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged..\ngrub-install: error: will not proceed with blocklists.\n\nI also tried boot-repair, with separate /boot/efi partition unticked, but I am getting error saying 'GPT detected. Please create BIOS-Boot and try again)[...]'\nHere's my bootinfo summary http://paste.ubuntu.com/12520209/\n/dev/sdc is pendrive with LiveCD Ubuntu, it's temporarily mounted.\nIs there a way to indicate GRUB2 to lookup ,gpt5 instead of gpt4, as indicated in bootinfo? I browsed askubuntu, but cases I found were related to UEFI mode for both systems and I would like to avoid setting up Ubuntu in UEFI mode.\n\nA: Since Ubuntu has been installed in Bios legacy mode and the device was UEFI enabled, Linux seeked for partition with bios_grub flag on, which surprisingly was not there. I created new partition,  1 MB in size, between my last Windows partition and first Linux partition. I set bios_grub flag for it, and left it unformatted. I used gparted to do that. After that I executed grub-install followed by update-grub. This operation detected partition with the flag, installed core.img to this new partition and updated MBR to seek core.img there. Now, my Ubuntu grub is running in legacy mode, just as I was expecting. \nI am posting my current bootinfo so that one can compare the changes.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/12530606/\n", "Q: Is there a detailed user's documentation for KDE Plasma 5? I just installed Kubuntu 15.04 and I can't find a single place with systematic description of all available desktop configuration settings. For example, I was setting Screen Locking Timeouts and I found by experiment that setting Lock screen after to 0 is the way to disable it. Another example is Edit application-specific settings: what is the difference between Apply initially and Remember options? Is there a single piece of documentation explaining these issues?\n\nA: The place for all KDE related User documentation is found at KDE Userbase. If you feel there are changes that should be made based on your experiences, there are a few things you can do, listed in descending order of relevance: \n(1) Edit the Wiki yourself, adding the specific information you've found. Information can be found here. Also see here.\n(2) Contact the documentation group via IRC: irc://irc.kde.org/kde-docs\n(3) Post a message on the Contributor's Corner section of the KDE Forums asking for the changes to be made or how you can most easily make them.\nHelp with documentation is ALWAYS needed and appreciated. \n", "Q: log-in problem as a user and guest session I have installed ubuntu 14.04 on VMware platform.

It receives connection through WiFi. However, I have a couple of Windows laptop in vicinity which requires internet connection. Is there any way that my laptop acts as server to provide internet connection via ethernet or wifi to other laptops ?\n\nA: I understand that you have a laptop which gets internet via WiFi and wishes to share the internet to other PCs via a different network. You want your laptop to act as the connection between the two networks.\nIn other words, you want to make your laptop, which has an internet connection to act as a gateway on a separate network that you create and connect all other devices to it. Here is the guide I followed. The documentation is for arch linux, but it will work on Ubuntu too. Here is an answer in another SE site that applies this idea.\nBut it is to be noted that a WiFi card can't connect to two different networks simultaneously. So if the the connection to the network from which you get internet is via WiFi, the second network you create should be via Ethernet.\n", "Q: Unable to tell if USB drive is correct I am attempting to install ubuntu desktop on a new PC with no other operating system on it.

I found instructions for verifying the contents of the USB drive, but when I select that option, the computer hangs in the same way.  I found instructions for using F6 to change install options (like noapci, etc), but when I press F6, the screen flashes briefly to black (for less than a second) and then the install menu comes back up as if nothing happened.  The same thing happens if I try the Test Memory option.  I am able to use the very last menu option to get a boot: prompt to come up, but I'm not sure what to type there.  If I just press enter, the computer hangs also.  I was able to boot from this same USB drive to the network install (mini.iso) previously and got much further into the installation, but ran into DHCP problems I have not yet solved.\n\nA: Try using a bootable USB with persistence enabled.  \n\nA Live USB is configured to run on almost all desktops and has a great\n  compatibility with various hardware.

When I plug in the second screen, all fonts are huge, the laptop's fonts are normal. \nIs there any way to combine the two and use different dpi (or even better, automatic) dpi settings per screen?\n\nA: Since at least Kubuntu 16.04 this is pretty easy to solve: Go to\nSystem Settings -> Display, choose your Displays one by one and click on the Scale Display bar at the very bottom.\nYou can scale your Content (including the fonts) up to 3 times the original size in that menu.

Tried also the old tricks, nothing worked. The only error I could find in any logs was in dmesg about a missing symbol (intel 915 something or other) needed by the hda driver. Reverting kernel back from 3.13.0-65 to 3.13.0-63 solved it for me. \nDon't know if the cause of your symptoms is the same as mine. However, if you want to try, here's how.\nTo try whether this helps in your case, without doing any permanent changes, try booting with an older kernel and see if sound over HDMI works. To do this, see How to get to the GRUB menu at boot-time?. I couldn't get to the grub menu by pressing shift, instead I had to modify /etc/default/grub (and run sudo update-grub) as described in the other post.\nUse the instructions from the other link, when you get to the grub boot menu, the older kernels are in a sub-menu, I think it was called something like \"Advanced Ubuntu options\". From the sub-menu pick a kernel older than 3.13.0-65. For me, everything older than that worked. I also tried 3.13.0-66 - did not work for me.\nOnce I found out that an older kernel works, I permanently reverted back to that version. See Kernel downgrade after update broke my system for instructions how to do that.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: \"The selected boot device failed\" when attempting to boot a Live USB on my device Today I received my new convertible device, a HP Pavilion x2 10-n015n, which came preinstalled with Windows 8.1 32bit.\nAs I'd like to - at least testwise - install Ubuntu GNOME on it, I created a bootable USB stick with the 14.04 LTS ISO of Ubuntu GNOME. However, when trying to boot it, I only receive the following message:\nThe selected boot device failed. Press <Enter> to continue.\n\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable fast boot in Windows\n\n*Disable Secure Boot in the BIOS settings\n\n*Searched for an option to enable Legacy booting, but there is none\n\n*Used both UnetBootin and Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator\n\n*Used two different USB drives\n\n*Tried both the 32bit and 64bit image of Ubuntu GNOME\n\n*Verified checksums (although it shouldn't be necessary using BitTorrent)\n\n*Also tried the \"normal\" Ubuntu (also 14.04), in case Ubuntu GNOME didn't yet support UEFI.\n\n*On my main computer (no UEFI, no Windows), the live system booted without problems each time.\n\n*Tried creating the bootstick using Rufus (both GPT and MBR parttables, both ISO and dd mode), as suggested by Raphael.\n\n\nNone of these helped me:\n\n\n*\n\n*“selected bootable device failed” error dual boot ubuntu alongside windows8.1\n\n*Dual Booting in HP Laptop \"Selected boot device failed to boot\" Error\nDo you have any idea why the USB won't boot or what can be done about it?\n\nA: Ok, here is what I've found out:\nThe system has a 32bit UEFI, while Ubuntu (and all other distros I know) currently only supports 64bit UEFI. I managed to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable Ubuntu USB stick using UnetBootin.\n\n*Download the latest rEFInd binary and installed it manually to the USB stick according to the instructions in rEFInd's online manual.\n\n*Create an entry in rEFInd's config file, equivalent to the \"Try without installing\" GRUB entry.\n\n*Reboot the system and manually select rEFInd's 32bit EFI executable.\n\n*Select the created menu entry and boot it.\n\n\nrEFInd now tries to boot the live system. As I removed the quiet splash options, I could see the boot log. However, after a few seconds, the screen turned black. I have not yet found out where the black screen comes from or what causes it, but I doubt it is an X11 issue, as Ctrl+Alt+Del reboots the system, which wouldn't happen if the graphical environment were running. But I managed to boot the kernel from the live system, which technically could count as booting the live system ;)\nHowever, I decided not to try installing Ubuntu any further, but I think this procedure can be helpful if someone else runs into a similar problem.\nUPDATE: After some more annoyances by Windows, I tried again. The solution for the black screen was simple: Added the nomodeset argument to the boot options, and the system properly booted.\nHowever, half of the device's hardware, including both WiFi and Bluetooth adapters, is not recognized (I'm not talking about no drivers, I'm talking about not even found by the system, e.g. listed in lshw).\nSo I guess I'll have to stick to Windows, then.\n\nA: That's an issue with the bootable pendrive, try using a different software to create the bootable medium such as: PendriveLinux or Rufus since you are on windows currently.\nHope this helps! \n\nA: In settings of UEFI/EFI-Bios you can adjust which boot-mode is active - there is \"legacy-boot-mode\" and there is the more simple plain \"boot-mode\" - either the one or the other is active and can be enfluenced. In former Bios (before UEFI or EFI came up) there was key F12 or key F9 with which one could select, which device to boot, but this was depending on whether the Bios recognized this device before. In UEFI/EFI you could try to deactivate legacy-boot-mode, but in case USB-device is brandish-newer than Bios then you need to update Bios.\n\nA: I had this exact problem. I did a couple of things:\n1 I swapped to legacy boot mode which was call legacy compatibility for me.\n2 (I think this was was actually did it) I had USB ports that were set to USB 3.0. I had to change this setting to \"Auto\" in the bios.\nThis way the ports are set to 2.0 then if the OS supports it, it swaps to 3.0, instead of booting as 3.0.\n", "Q: Extract strings from my git commits So over the past couple of weeks I've decided to note down my billable times in git commits. This allows a client to see how much they're spending but also it means I don't have to make it all up at the end of the week. It's good for both of us.\nI've been leaving little coded messages at the end of my commits. Here's a sample:\nFlushed out the flux capacitor, drank some BRAWNDO.\n\nT=0.3\n\nThat means I spent ~20 minutes doing something. 1 is an hour.\nSo I have these littered throughout my projects. The question now is, how do I pick these out from a certain date, and add them up so I can bill the client?\nI should add that these are not single-user projects. Some are collaborative other developer may wish to follow my lead and handle their billing this way. I need to filter on just my commits.\n\nA: We can limit what logs git outputs based on who (--author: can be a name or email) and when (--since: takes a bizarre number of formats and fuzzy strings).\nThen we just need to find lines that start with T=, add plus symbols between all the numbers and feed them into the command line calculator bc.\n$ git log --all --author=Oli --since=\"1 week\" | grep -oP '(?<=T=)[\\d.]+' | paste -sd+ | bc\n30.5\n\nOr with an awk:\n$ git log --all --author=Oli --since=\"1 week\" | awk -F= '/T\\=[0-9.]+/{t+=$2} END{print t}'\n30.5\n\nUrgh, only 30.5 hours?! It feels like 60.\nIn a bigger project with millions of commits, it might be wise to add on a --grep '^T=' to the git log command. This will do a quick filter down internally before the external grep conditions the data.\n\nA problem occurred after starting to use this. I needed to reset the clock. I've been through several iterations of script (lots of clever piping) but thanks to git rebase and other tree-messing-up operations, the best way to sort commits by date, and so they only show up once is to do it manually.\nTherefore I present the ugliest functional script I think I've ever written.\nTOTAL=0\nSTARTD=\"\"\n\nfunction dfmt {\n    date -d$1 +%Y-%m-%d\n}\n\nwhile read DATE HASH; do\n    [[ -z $STARTD ]] && STARTD=$DATE\n    while read M; do\n        if [[ $M == \"RESET\" ]]; then\n            echo -e \"$(dfmt $STARTD) to $(dfmt $DATE)\\t$TOTAL\"\n            TOTAL=0\n            STARTD=$DATE\n        else\n            TOTAL=$(bc <<< \"$TOTAL + $M\")\n        fi\n    done < <(git show -s $HASH | grep -oP '(?<=T=)([\\d.]+|RESET)')\ndone < <(git log --author=Oli --all --pretty=\"%aI %H\" | sort -u -k1,1)\n\necho -e \"$(dfmt $STARTD) to $(dfmt now)*\\t$TOTAL\\t\" $(bc <<< \"scale=2; $TOTAL / 8.0\") \" days\"\n\nThis parses every commit and outputs every billing chunk (between T=RESET tokens). It's much better. It's much slower. It seems inevitable that I'll rewrite this in Python one day but I have to do paying work for now :)\n", "Q: Restart network with a command without need to provide password The wireless network on my dell laptop goes away many a times when resuming from 'suspend'. Once I run 'sudo service network-manager restart', it starts to work.\nI was wondering if there was a way where I could restart the network while resuming from suspend and only if the wireless network was not up! What would be the best way to be able to restart network without having to enter a password?\nI don't want to manually do it by going over to network icon and then taking some mouse actions. I did rather have a command which I could set up as a shortcut. I tried creating a bash executable with content 'service network-manager restart' and setting setuid on the executable as well as giving root the ownership of it but that didn't work.\nI have Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty OS.\n\nA: You can make a change to sudoers to allow your user account to execute the necessary commands without password.\nWarning: Be sure to not delete anything from sudoers without exactly knowing what its for! You could potentially loose all admin privileges.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open sudo visudo\n\n*In the section headed \"Cmnd alias specification\" add\nCmnd_Alias NETWORK = /usr/sbin/service network-manager restart\n\nNETWORK is just an alias for a group of commands. Give it a different name if you prefer!\n\n*At the end of the file, append the statement\nuser_name ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: NETWORK\n\nwhere you substitute your user account for user_name. Also replace NETWORK with whatever name you've given the alias. One could also do without the alias and simply replace it by the command, but I prefer it this way. I find it keeps things more organized.\n\n*Safe the file and exit the editor. Check with sudo -l that you are now indeed allowed to issue the command. \nYou still need to prepend the command with sudo, but you won't be prompted for a password anymore.\n\nA: Another possibility is to use the command line interface of Network Manager (it's not so \"strong\" as restarting the daemon, but it worked for me). In this case, the operation is exactly the same as if you interact with the applet, so you do not need any privilege. \nTo restart the wifi interface, use this code: \nnmcli nm wifi off\nsleep 5\nnmcli nm wifi on\n\nI had similar problems with the network dropping (it was a faulty router in my case), so I used this script added to the startup jobs: \n#!/bin/bash\nPINGTEST=192.168.1.1 # my router, change here. google.com should work anytime ;-)\nwhile /bin/true; do\n    if ! [ \"$(ping -c 1 $PINGTEST)\" ]; then\n        echo \"Warning: connection lost at $(date) -- restart\" 1>&2  \n        nmcli nm wifi off\n        sleep 5\n        nmcli nm wifi on\n        sleep 60\n        if ! [ \"$(ping -c 1 $PINGTEST)\" ]; then\n             echo \"Waiting for connection going up at $(date)\" 1>&2\n             sleep 60\n        else \n             echo \"Connection on at $(date)\" 1>&2\n        fi\n#    else\n#        echo \"Connection OK on $(date)\" 1>&2\n    fi\nsleep 60\ndone\n\nit checks the connection every minute and if it does not work, it restarts the wifi. \nIf this is not sufficient, you probably have to use stronger weapons, like starting/stopping Network Manager. Even that sometime fails on me, and I have to resort to unload (sudo rmmod) and then reload (sudo modprobe) the wifi card driver module.  \n\nA: You should be able to add something similar to this:\nYourUserName ALL=NOPASSWD: service network-manager restart\n\nto your /etc/sudoers file and be able to restart network-manager with your script. \n\nA: I finally ended up writing the script /etc/pm/sleep.d/0000_custom:\n#!/bin/sh\n# /etc/pm/sleep.d/0000_custom\n# Action script to lock screen and resume wifi properly\nPATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin\ncase \"$1\" in\n    suspend|hibernate)\n        #do nothing\n    ;;\n    resume|thaw)\n        X_USER=`who| grep ' :0'|cut -f1 -d' '`\n# lock screen when resuming from suspend\n        sudo -u $X_USER xscreensaver-command -lock\n# turn wifi on when resuming from suspend\n        nmcli nm wifi on\n    ;;\nesac\nexit 0\n\nThanks to @RMano and @Nephente for their answers.\n\nA: On Ubuntu MATE 20.10 I'm using:\nnmcli n off\nsleep 5\nnmcli n on\n\nHere is my \"one-liner\" to monitor and restart networking after 6 consecutive router pings failed (sometime connection restores on itself after some failed attemts):\ncc=0; date; echo \"monitoring network connection\"; while true ; do ( ! ping -c1 192.168.88.1 >/dev/null ) && { date; cc=$((cc+1)); echo \"connection lost times: $cc\"; } || { [ $cc -ne 0 ] && { date; echo \"connection ok\"; }; cc=0; }; [ $cc -gt 5 ] && { notify-send \"network restarting\"; nmcli n off; sleep 5; nmcli n on; cc=4; sleep 10; }; sleep 10; done\n\nNote: The 192.168.88.1 is the IP address of my router.

Help?\n\nA: Toggle xinput device on or off with following bash script.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndevice=13\nstate=$(xinput list-props \"$device\" | grep \"Device Enabled\" | grep -o \"[01]$\")\n\nif [ $state == '1' ];then\n  xinput --disable \"$device\"\nelse\n  xinput --enable \"$device\"\nfi\n\n\nA: I made this one-liner from Jason YiZhang Chen's answer.  It's handy if you just need a command to put in a keyboard shortcut or startup job.  It exploits the fact that you can also set properties of devices by name, and that the name of the touchpad won't change.\nTo get the device name:\n$ xinput | grep Touchpad\n⎜   ↳ ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad                  id=18   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nSo my device is called ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad.  I hardcode that into this one-liner:\n[ \"$(xinput list-props 'ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad' | grep 'Device Enabled' | grep -o '[01]$')\" == \"1\" ] && xinput --disable 'ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad' || xinput --enable 'ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad'\n\n", "Q: Cannot mount /dev/dm-2 .

Once that works intend to move to ppc64le image (our goal).\n\nA: If the machines are already enlisted and commissioned in MAAS, the arch value presented by MAAS will be ppc64el.\nI have had success in doing OpenStack (Kilo) testing and validation on Power8 hardware, running Ubuntu Server as the native operating system (14.04).\nIt should not be necessary to modify the Ubuntu Server images or pxe files, as long as the appropriate images are in MAAS, and the virtual machine nodes are configured to be controlled by MAAS.\nThe Kilo cloud archive, or later, is necessary in order to consume a compatible version of libvirt.\nThe HWE-U 3.16 kernel (\"ppc64el/hwe-u\") or later is necessary for hardware-enablement.  This can be specified in MAAS via the Machine-->Architecture attribute.\nThe nova-compute units will need post-deployment tuning to set cpu-mode=host-passthrough.  There is a charm config option currently in development to make this option easier to set via the nova-compute charm.\n", "Q: Installer Crash and \"No Bootable Device\" with Acer R11 On the Acer Aspire R11 I tried running Ubuntu from the USB, it was awesome!!\nTouch features and a fully powered laptop !!\nBut when I wanted to install Ubuntu (I had downloaded 14.04.3) the problems appear :\nI chose to erase Windows and make only one partition\n\n\n*\n\n*Installation seemed to work fine, everything looking good, BUT:\n\n*On restart, after I remove the USB it shows error \"no bootable device\"\n\n\nI went into the BIOS and tried to repeat the installation with :\n\n\n*\n\n*secure mode disabled and then with it enabled\n\n*using legacy instead of UEFI, then tried UEFI again\n\n*F12 boot was already enabled from the start\n\n*In order to disable the secure boot mode, I had to create a boot admin password, so I have done.\n\n\nIn all these permutations, I tried to install Ubuntu from the USB but:\nEach time the installation is aborted about half way through downloading files (i.e. after the \"who are you?\" screen)\nWhat to do?\n\nA: In the end I found that I had to  install Ubuntu from a DVD, not a USB. \nThat worked perfectly.\n\nA: It will work from usb if you add the acpi=off option to the boot command, both before and after the -- delimiter.\nTo get the command line in legacy mode: press the \"down\" key when the keyboard icon comes up, select English. Make sure \"Try Ubuntu Before Installing\" is highighted then press F6. Don't select anything in the menu that comes up, press esc. The boot command will display below. Add acpi=off before and after -- then press enter.\nTo get the command line in UEFI mode: with \"Try Ubuntu Before Installing\" is highlighted in GRUB, press e. Again, add acpi=off before and after --, then press F10.\nAlternately, boot to another OS and/or on another PC, then plug in the USB stick and use an editor that will allow you to save in UNIX format then:\nFor UEFI mode: Edit \\boot\\grub\\grub.cfg to add acpi=off before and after -- where it appears and save.\nFor Legacy mode: Edit isolinux\\txt.cfg to add acpi=off before and after -- where it appears and save.\n", "Q: How to fix \"You are not allowed to perform this action\" I'm using Xubuntu 14.04 \nXubuntu stops me from doing certain things like software updater or installing things through software manager. However, I can still do things through terminal. For example: If I navigate to the system menu, then click on Software Updater, it will pop up, do nothing, then tell me I can't do it. But if I were to open it through terminal it works fine.\n\nA: I do everything through the terminal, but if I recall correctly, there's some program (possibly gksu or gksudo; there may be a different one for xubuntu) which will prompt for your password when you try to do things which require root via the gui. Check if you have those installed.\n", "Q: Recognize SD card as /dev/sdX rather than /dev/mmcblkX How do I change the system so that it recognizes SD cards as /dev/sdX rather than /dev/mmcblkX?  I want to do this because scripts depend on sdX.  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: As a workaround, you can probably just create a hard link from /dev/mmcblkX to /dev/sdX.\nA hard link is just another file descriptor that you link with the device. Hard links can not be distinguished from the original file descriptors.\nThe command to create such a hard link is:\nsudo ln /dev/mmcblkX /dev/sdX\n\nIf you use an already existing descriptor as link name, it will print an error message and abort instead of overwriting the old descriptor, so make sure you use an unoccupied name. As Ubuntu uses the sd? names in alphabetical order, you maybe want to link it to sdz, which will probably never get occupied by the system.\nYou will have to create the link probably only once if the source descriptor /dev/mmcblkX is persistent and does not go away when you pull the card out of its slot.\nOtherwise it might be better to create the link every time after inserting the card and removing it after pulling it out again...\n", "Q: write to floppy under ubuntu 15.04 I cant write to floppy-disk!\nReading is ok..\nBut write does not do .. you are not the owner \nOwner is root.\nI am new with Linux/ubuntu\nSo please some detailed info what i should do.\nThanks in advance\nThanks for all lines to try.. but no one did work(OWNER REMAIND  ROOT)\nfound an solution occasional (just trying some lines from other questions containing the word  floppy)\n1. put in floppy disk\n2. in a terminal do the following line:\nudisks --mount /dev/fd0\n(ubuntu had to install udisks-- but did it without great noise)\nafter that-- i am the owner of the disk!!\nwrite and read works!!\nonly fromat returns after some scratching on the disk with an time out error.\nto change floppy::\n1. unmount... udisks --unmount /dev/fd0\n2. put in new floppy\n3. mount... udisks --mount /dev/fd0\n\nA: Type \nsudo chmod -R 777 (location of your floppy disk mount point) \n\nThis makes you the owner.\n", "Q: Meizu MX4 touchscreen problems The touchscreen of my Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition is not working correctly.\nUntil today the screen sometimes did its own thing. moving around and opening all kind of apps.

In Ubuntu I'm trying to enable wifi but there is no enable wifi option available. Please tell me what I have to do to fix this.\n\nA: Chances are that the firmware for your particular wireless card is not pre-installed with Ubuntu.  Try typing the following command from a terminal:\nlshw -C network\n\nIf something comes up with information about your wireless card's chipset, then that's a good thing -- it means Ubuntu sees it and is able to identify it.\nWhat you then need to do is find the firmware for your particular wireless card.  You can go to http://packages.ubuntu.com and type in the chipset name it gives you (this will be something like Atheros, Broadcom, IBM, etc.).  You will then be presented with a list of firmware choices.  Download one (this should be in the form of a .deb file) and save it to a USB drive.  Plug that USB drive into your system and try double-clicking it, which will install it.  Oh, and you will more than likely need to reboot in order for Ubuntu to load the firmware at startup.\nIf that particular piece of firmware doesn't do it for you, try one of the other choices that shows up when you type in your chipset name.\nHope this helps!\nFred in St. Louis\n", "Q: Can't install Nvidia drivers on Ubuntu 15.04 I have the gtx670 and I'm trying to get any of the Nvidia drivers installed.

Graphical programs like the file manager (typically Nautilus) or the browser (Firefox, or Google Chrome, for example) need an instance of the X Window System (typically provided by X.Org's X server) to run.\nCorrespondingly, command-line programs like Bash, apt-get, lynx, etc., to be run interactively, need a terminal emulator to run. By default, Ubuntu has GNOME Terminal, XTerm and the TTYs (managed by getty, accessible by pressing CtrlAltF1-F6 - back to GUI by CtrlAltF7) via which you can interact with command line programs.\nTo run a command-line program, then, you need to run a terminal emulator (for example, GNOME Terminal) first.\nThe terminal emulator programs typically run bash by default (since that is the default login shell for users in Ubuntu). Therefore, to run bash, usually all you need to do is run Terminal.\nWithout a terminal to run in, when you started Bash or Dash, they probably quit immediately. Nothing to see here, folks.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line?\n\n*What is the exact difference between a 'terminal', a 'shell', a 'tty' and a 'console'?\n\n*What is the best way to learn how to use Ubuntu with terminal?\n\nMaking a launcher icon for a command line program is a different issue. For that, see How can I edit/create new launcher items in Unity by hand?, and use Terminal=true instead of Terminal=false.\n\nA: bash is a shell; basically a program that reads commands and executes them. It is one of the interfaces between the kernel and the user. \nI do not know what do you call \"apps\", but if I understand correctly, bash is under the level of what you call \"an app\". But it's a fundamental part of the system... \nHave a good read here: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-getting-started.htm --- the diagram below is a graphic example of a Unix system architecture from that site (it's a link, not a copy...)\n\nYou can run bash in a terminal, in a virtual console, in a background program. Your system is probably running several instance of bash right now. \nAs far as any Unix system is designed, the graphical interface and the graphical applications are just another kind of application programs --- this is one of the reason that Ubuntu (and all other Unixes) can use several different graphic interfaces. \n\nA: The terminal is NOT BASH.

Can I get the maximum speed? Or I have to buy a SSD?\n\nA: 1GBit = 1000MBit = 1000 (MBit / 8Bit) * Byte = 125MByte\n\nAny reasonably 3,5\" 7200RPM HDD should be able to handle that.\nAt least when performing sequential writes. The performance will be worse with random writes. \nI don't think this is an issue though. If you're writing a lot of small files over the network, performance is typically bottle-necked by the network transfer protocol. From my own experience I can tell, that SMB performs terribly when it comes to a large number of files.\nUsing SSDs in a pure storage setting (e.g a NAS) is a waste of money.\nHowever, in addition to much faster read/write rates, their strength is access time. In a server setting with many concurrent read/write request, like a web- or mail-server, an SSD can make quite the difference.\nSince you already own the HDD, you might want to try and make do with it first. If the performance is not satisfying you can still buy a suitable SSD and replace the hard-drive.\n\nA: Your computer should be able to handle Gigabit Ethernet just fine regardless for the HDD.  It's what's a bottleneck is the issue.  If you want to be able to write to the HDD over the network at 1 gigabit per second, then that's going to require a hard drive that can write at 1000 megabits/sec, or 250MB/sec.\nYou can use Gigabit LAN with a slower HDD, you just can't write to that HDD over the network at 1Gbps.  You will benefit from having Gigabit LAN in other ways, so go for it anyways.\n", "Q: Docker performance on ubuntu host 2x+ worse than OSX host Ok, let's start over after a bunch of investigation.

You probably should try to ping your router using ip6 with ping6 <your routers ip6 address or hostname>\nIf you want to use ip4 in your local network, you should configure your dhcp server (I suppose your local network is initialized using dhcp). Usually that should be part of the router configuration.\nIn general you can check $ route -n to see all the networks that you can reach.\n", "Q: Gedit plugins not working after upgrading from version 12.04 to 14.04 Some Gedit plugins (for example codecomment) are not working after upgrading from version 12.04 to 14.04.

Therefore I'd like to run it in a way that allows me to answer the questions as well as sending the output to a file.\nCan this be done ?\nThanks.\nMike\n\nA: While answering you are giving input via file descriptor 0 i.e. STDIN and the program is showing output on file descriptor 1 i.e. STDOUT. As you can see these two are wowking on different file descriptors and manipulating one should not hamper the operation of other. \nNote that there is also file descriptor 2 i.e. STDERR normally used for showing error messages.\nIn you case run the script as:\n./myscript.sh >~/script.out\n\nNow you can provide input answers to the questions of the script via STDIN and the output of the program will be saved in ~/script.out.\nYou can save the error also e.g. in another file:\n./myscript.sh >~/script.out 2>~/script.err\n\nThe STDOUT will be saved in ~/script.out and the STDERR will be saved in ~/script.err. \nYou can save the output and error both in the same file:\n./myscript.sh >~/script.all 2>&1\n\nNow ~/script.all will contain the outputs and error messages (if any) from myscript.sh.\n", "Q: command not found: spotify-client I tried to install Spotify from this tutorial http://itsfoss.com/install-spotify-ubuntu-1504/ and when I launched it from the terminal is said command not found.

It is /etc, not /ect.\nJust to be clear, it seems you have not created a directory named /ect yourself so we can assume the standard name which is /etc.\nI would suggest you to have a look at man hier to get more idea about how directories are laid out typically in Linux.\n", "Q: GnuPG Private key can be exported without password I'm using Seahorse on Ubuntu, and I found that using the 'export secret key' option allows me to save an unencrypted *.asc file containing my GnuPG private key, with neither root access nor the password used to secure the key. I cannot change the picture or other settings for the key without entering that password. \nI am very new at this, but it seems to be a security risk. How can I configure my key so it can't be exported at the click of a button?\n\nA: It's not a security risk. The only vulnerability you are ;). You have to make sure that does not get your private key into the wrong hands.\nEveryone who has access to your system and has sufficient access rights, can copy your key. Seahorse can not prevent that, too.\nEncrypt your partitions and use a sufficiently strong password for your user account. Lock your system when you leave your workstation. Made sure that your backups are encrypted.\n\nA: Using GnuPG, your keys are stored within your own home directory -- thus, no root permissions are required.\nIf your key is password protected, this password is required for exporting the key. The password could be stored/cached in two ways, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Seahorse itself storing it in its password store or\n\n*gpg-agent being active, caching the password for a while.\n\n", "Q: How to always show some hidden files in Nautilus?

Please resume and shutdown Windows fully(no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume read-only with 'ro' mount option.\n\n\nA: This has to do with how Windows implements \"Hybrid boot\", in which it essentially saves all of the kernel memory onto the disk (sort of a half-hibernate...it saves the kernel space memory, but not the user space memory) when you press \"Shut Down\" through the start menu.\nYou need to boot back into Windows and shut it down \"fully\" by running the command 'shutdown /s /t 0', in an Administrator command prompt. That forces Windows to not write the kernel memory data to the disk (the \"Windows cache\" that Linux is referring to). Additionally, you can make a shortcut to this command on your desktop to make doing full shutdowns easier.\nAfter shutting Windows down fully, boot back into Linux, and all should be well.\nSee this link for a more detailed explanation of all of this.\n\nA: In your Windows machine, open control panel - then power options - then click on 'choose what power button does' on the left side - click on 'change settings that are currently unavailable', - under shutdown settings, un check 'turn on fast startup', then reboot into Ubuntu and you should be able to mount \n", "Q: Problem after \"sudo apt-get install fglrx-amdcccle\" After I enter sudo apt-get install fglrx-amdcccle my Ubuntu 15.04 not enter to desktop and just ask password.

With spaces in the middle as \n00 DF 00 45.\nThe thing is that when I counted the characters in both file it showed a huge difference.\nlaksith@laksithPC:~/Desktop/test$ cat split_space.txt | wc -c\n31617470\nlaksith@laksithPC:~/Desktop/test$ cat BSC0000.log | wc -c\n10539157\n\nA guess can be made that it might be because of the spaces in between\n. But then it should be roughly like 10539157 + 10539157/2 but how come it be this value 31617470.\nbut 10539157 * 3 = 31617471   that is the value from the command line +1\n\nA: A byte has 8 bits.  Because hex uses 16 characters, 0-9a-f, it can only display  four bits per character.  It takes two hex characters to display one byte.  Add to that that most characters in the hex display have a space after them and you see why the hex display takes up to three times as many bytes as the binary file.\nExample\nLet's create a file containing a single byte:\n$ printf 'a' >afile\n$ wc afile\n0 1 1 afile\n\nNow, let's display it with, for example, hexdump -C:\n$ hexdump -C afile\n00000000  61                                                |a|\n00000001\n\nThe a character is ASCII character 61 (hex).  The single byte in the file takes two characters to display in hex (and three if the hex has a space after it).\n", "Q: groupdel: cannot remove the primary group of user 'administrator' When I try to delete the group pro1 (groupdel pro1) it shows the error: \n\ngroupdel: cannot remove the primary group of user 'administrator'\n\nAnd when I create new user from AD server, the user's default group is pro1.\nHow can I fix this problem? Thanks.\n\nA: This is documented in the man page. From man groupdel:\n\nYou may not remove the primary group of any existing user. You must\n  remove the user before you remove the group.\n\nSo you need to make the primary group of user administrator something other than pro1 and then you should be able to remove group pro1.\nExample:\n$ sudo groupdel foobar \ngroupdel: cannot remove the primary group of user 'foobar'\n$ sudo usermod -g foo foobar  ## Change the primary group of user \"foobar\" from \"foobar\" to \"foo\"\n$ sudo groupdel foobar  ## Done\n\n", "Q: How to decrease the file name by 1 in ubuntu I have around 200 .png files in my folder, naming like -\n02.png\n03.png\n04.png\n...\n201.png\n\nAs you can see I dont have 01.png so I want to rename the all files decreasing by one, to make it like -\n01.png\n02.png\n03.png\n...\n200.png\n\nIs it possible it to do it via any command in ubuntu ?\nFollowing is the command I am trying with no luck -\nrename -n '/d{2}\\.png$d{2}-1\\.png/' *.png\n\n\nA: This can be done with a somewhat more complex rename command:\nrename -n 's/(\\d{2,3}).png/sprintf(\"%02d\", $1-1) . \".png\"/e' *.png\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to separate the match and the replacement with a /.\n\n*You need to group the part you want to remember using $1 with () (in this case (\\d{2,3})).\n\n*You should match both 2- and 3-digit numbers, or 100.png will become 1-1.png.\n\n*To use an arithmetic or functions in the replacement, it should be evaluated as an expression, that's why there's a e after the closing /.\n\n*To combine strings in an evaluated expression, you need to use . (hence . \".png\").\n\n*To pad strings with zeros (presumably what you want, since your original files had them), use sprintf. %02d will pad with zeros if your number doesn't have at least two digits.\n\n\nExample:\n$ rename -n 's/(\\d{2,3}).png/sprintf(\"%02d\", $1-1) .  \".png\"/e' *.png | head\n02.png -> 01.png\n03.png -> 02.png\n04.png -> 03.png\n05.png -> 04.png\n06.png -> 05.png\n07.png -> 06.png\n08.png -> 07.png\n09.png -> 08.png\n100.png -> 99.png\n101.png -> 100.png\n\n\nDepending on the version of rename, it might have trouble renaming files if the target already exists. In such cases, a simple workaround is to create a temporary directory and rename/move the files there:\nmkdir temp\nrename -n 's/(\\d{2,3}).png/sprintf(\"temp\\/%02d\", $1-1) . \".png\"/e' *.png\n\nNote that / after temp needs to be escaped, or it will be taken as the final / of a s// command.\n", "Q: Failure to install any updates (problems with apport and insserv) Lately the updates are not installing, and when I try sudo apt-get upgrade (obviously, after update), I get the errors below.

I would like to know how I could generate a custom initrd (like the one here) for the installer.\nI've googled for how to do it and all I could find was basically how to insert a random kernel module or a preseed. That's not what I'm after here (I know how to unpack it, play around and then pack it again). \nIt's not just for the purpose of doing simple customizations I'd like to know. \nIt's out of curiosity (somehow canonical must have generated these without having to repack an existing initrd), the possibility to do modifications to the initrd in a sane way (fx alter it to log to RS232, adding support for other suites than main/restricted/universe/multiverse for both .debs and .udebs, to investigate the workings and non-working of the installer), the possibility to generate customized initrds for different releases in a sane way. Possibly also eventually roll an initrd containing something else than the installer (fx some server software).\n\nA: The initrd for the debian installer is a normal root file system, stripped down to the components required for the installer (i.e. using udeb packages that do not contain documentation).\nRegular system boot uses a minimal initrd that loads a few modules, and then switches to the real root file system, but from the point of view of the kernel, the system is already running at this point, and the switch is entirely optional.\nThe installer runs from a ramdisk, which is initialized with the contents of the initrd archive. The only requirement the kernel has is that there is a file called init either in the root or below sbin, and this file will be invoked.\nYou can, for example, create a full installation using debootstrap, create an archive of that using cpio, and use that as an initrd -- so the process used by the kernel package to generate a small initrd is really a special case.\n", "Q: How to get debuginfo package for -rt kernel I have Ubuntu 14.04 with 3.14.3-rt4 kernel.

I've put the server thing on the back burnerfor now although I would like to be able to install virtual boxes with dedicated servers on them eventually . Anyway I worked at Apple as a genius for almost 4 years and got the idea there to take the hard drive out of my laptop, put it where the optical drive goes and replace where the hard drive went with an SSD. And doing so, with a bunch of terminal commands I combined the two drives into 1 readable drive and the computer is now MUCH faster.  However with Linux it looks like the combining of hard drives/SSDs is a lot different (and I am new to Linux).  Currently I have a 500 GB HDD drive and a 1 TB HDD as well as a 250GB SSD.  I know with the Mac it automatically optimized what should be dedicated on each drive (as far as bootable partitions vs. storage space etc.) but I'm not show sure how to format/configure it with Linux. Any ideas? Please help!\n\nA: To answer part of your question. I have a similar setup (Ubuntu 15.04 with a 2 TB HDD and a 250GB SSD). With two drives it's easy, you simply put your root directory / on one and your /home directory on the other.\nDuring installation, choose a custom installation and mount your root directory and swap space on the SSD. I usually dedicate 1-2 times the amount of RAM to the swap space (i.e. 16GB of RAM, 32 GB of swap space).\nOn the HDD select it as your /home folder mounting point.\nBAM! There you have it, your system critical components are now on the SSD with the superior read/write rate, and your user files (Downloads, Documents, Music, Pictures, etc.) are on your inexpensive, large storage platform. Your system should now fully boot astronomically faster. If you ever need to store a database or serve content (i.e. an Apache Web Server), make sure to put it in a system directory like /var so the content can be accessed quickly.\nNow the rest of your question. I don't have very much experience in LVM or RAID, but I imagine you could combine your two HDDs into one Logical Volume to contain your /home folder.\nNote that my method does not optimize content, it is a manual configuration. By default, system items will be installed on the SSD (minus some user specific configuration files) and your files, scripts, downloads, etc. will be placed in the default directory /home/<user>/.\nHappy hacking.\nRegards,Lisenby\n\nA: There are several projects which allow you to use an SSD as a cache for an existing hard drive.\nbcache is one of these, it caches at the block level and should give you a decent speed boost.\nTo install bcache\ngit clone -b bcache-dev http://evilpiepirate.org/git/linux-bcache.git\ngit clone -b dev http://evilpiepirate.org/git/bcache-tools.git\n\nThen, just run\nbcacheadm format -C /dev/sda1\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nA great guide for this can be found HERE.\nflashcache is another project of this same type.\nTo install flashcache you will have to build it from source.\nDownload the file change to that directory and\ngit clone https://github.com/facebook/flashcache.git\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\nA more detaild and advanced guide can be found HERE.\n\nA: This is not an perfect answer, but anyway:\nTry using \"RAID\" on all your drives, you're not using RAID or something like \"Anti-RAID\", however RAID is not suitable for some times, like installing Windows, and maybe the entire Ubuntu except if you use a type called \"Software RAID\"\n", "Q: Where can I see which ubuntu release ships the fixed version of a program affected by a bug? This bug is marked \"fixed released\":\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python3.4/+bug/1290847\nWhere can I see which Ubuntu release ships the fixed version?\nPS: I would like to avoid reading the long floating text. Is there no database entry for this?\nUpdate: I am wearing end user glasses. I don't care about the package version with the fix. I care about the ubuntu release with the fix.\n\nA: Because you are wearing a pair of end user glasses ;) – here is an answer including images…\nYour mentioned bug has a fix and the fix is released. However, it is not yet clear in which Ubuntu release it will be included.\n   \nAnd the comment #43 is also interesting (Thanks @muru).\n\n> Why is this marked as \"Fix Released? This is still broken.\nFix released means fixed in the development series, not necessarily\n  in released versions of Ubuntu.\n\n\nAn other example is bug 1264554 in the same package. As you can see in the screenshot, the fix for the bug was released for Trusty.\n   \n\nWhat does that tell us?\nAs long as you can't see this nice icon with the name of the Ubuntu release\n   \nthe bug isn't fixed.\n\nA: I took this question to be, how do I find, which releases contain a certain version of a package.  \nYou can find a lot of information by looking at the ubuntu packages site.  I just searched for the package 'python3' in all versions of ubuntu:-\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=all&section=all&arch=any&keywords=python3&searchon=names\nIt came up with this:-\nPackage python3\n\n\n*\n\n*precise (12.04LTS) (python): interactive high-level object-oriented language (default python3 version) \n3.2.3-0ubuntu1: all\n\n*precise-updates (python): interactive high-level object-oriented language (default python3 version) \n3.2.3-0ubuntu1.2: amd64 i386\n\n*trusty (14.04LTS) (python): interactive high-level object-oriented language (default python3 version) \n3.4.0-0ubuntu2: amd64 i386\n\n*utopic (python): interactive high-level object-oriented language (default python3 version) \n3.4.2-1: amd64 i386\n\n*vivid (python): interactive high-level object-oriented language (default python3 version) \n3.4.3-1: amd64 i386\n\n*wily (python): interactive high-level object-oriented language (default python3 version) \n3.4.3-4ubuntu1: amd64 i386\n\n\nHence I think Python version 3.4 is in trusty, utopic, vivid and wily\nIt would be helpful, if who-ever on launchpad marked something as fixed, identified which version of python contains a particular fix, but as the discussion on launchpad said, that's not straight forward (and I'd argue, it's not an ubuntu specific issue either).  \n", "Q: Errors were encountered while processing: libxau-dev:amd64 I have removed Java version 1.8 and now want to install version 1.7.

So I was wondering how to create a signed deb package.\n\nA: Package signing on Debian/Ubuntu is commonly done via .changes files. When building a package you tend to end up with a .changes file, listing the results of the build (source and/or binary packages) and their checksums, when you sign packages this is normally the file you sign (thus allowing verification of the package integrity by way of its checksum).\nThe simplest way to sign a .changes file is to use debsign\ndebsign hello_1.0_amd64.changes\n\nThis occurs automatically if you have a primary key in you gnupg keychain, and you run dpkg-buildpackage or debuild without the -us and -uc switches.\n\nA: Package signing on Ubuntu/Debian systems is rather messy. In theory, signing a deb package makes it possible for the person receiving your package to verify that the package was not modified after you signed it. In reality, signature verification is terribly difficult to setup and is disabled by default. Unless the user does a bunch of setup locally, they won't be verifying the signature when the package is installed.\nIn order to sign a package, you can use either: debsigs or dpkg-sig. The signatures are not compatible with one another, so you'll need to make sure the user is using the proper tool on the receiving side for verifying signatures.\ndpkg-sig is easier to use for both you and the user, but debsigs is the tool with built-in support (which is disabled by default) on Ubuntu and Debian.\nI wrote a blog post containing all the technical details of signing and verifying source packages (.dsc files), binary packages (.deb), and APT package repositories themselves here: http://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2014/10/28/howto-gpg-sign-verify-deb-packages-apt-repositories/\n", "Q: Running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as a media server, now I want to add Ubuntu TV I'm running 14.04 LTS as a media server and I've just come across Ubuntu TV.

There was a solution for Ubuntu 12.04 as it is still proposed in wiki.ubuntu.com\nServer or Desktop version doesn't really matter I think.\nBut if you want to transform your Ubuntu Server into a Media Center, Koki is a good choice. You can install Kodi on your Ubuntu Server without Desktop Environment. The procedure is well described (exemple).\nYou can also share media stored on your server and access them with Kodi installed on another computer. There are some simple techniques to do that such as Samba or NFS sharing, UPnP/DLNA server, etc.\n", "Q: Adding by-path to /dev/disk I have a script relying on /dev/disk/by-path, but that subdirectory does not exist.

Responsible for this is udev and the rules in\n/lib/udev/rules.d/60-persistent-storage.rules\n\nWith a simple command you can see the rules:\n% grep -ri 'by-path' /lib/udev/rules.d/60-persistent-storage.rules\n# persistent storage links: /dev/disk/{by-id,by-uuid,by-label,by-path}\n# by-path (parent device path)\nENV{DEVTYPE}==\"disk\", ENV{ID_PATH}==\"?*\", SYMLINK+=\"disk/by-path/$env{ID_PATH}\"\nENV{DEVTYPE}==\"partition\", ENV{ID_PATH}==\"?*\", SYMLINK+=\"disk/by-path/$env{ID_PATH}-part%n\"\n\n\nAnd you should not use ls /dev/disk/by-path to get the values for your variables.

Generally stuff that works on WinXP should work well.\nYou may also find PlayOnLinux helpful as installs apps with workarounds etc for you.\nNot all software devs support Linux (and if they sometimes do not support it very well...), many of them do not support as they do not think it will make them money (WARNING: opinions), or are lazy, or they find it difficult to implement stuff so that the game's files cannot be taken apart and used/do stuff in OpenGL instead of DirectX etc....\n", "Q: Can SQLite3 be upgraded on Ubuntu? I would like to upgrade SQLite3 on my Ubuntu instance that is running version 3.8.2.  The current release is 3.11.1.x.  I wanted to know if there is any risk in doing so since SQLite3 is a core tool to Ubuntu and many apps use it.\nIf its safe to do, what is the best approach?  Install from the Linux distribution or download source and build?\nThanks\n\nA: I am afraid nobody can possibly tell you that it is safe. That would mean that we can be 100% sure that the changes made after 3.8.2 will not affect your installation. That is obviously impossible. The prudent way would be to test the new version on a test system that is not used for production, and if nothing goes wrong as far as you can see, upgrading your production system.\nIt might be wise to read the release notes though.\n\nA: If everything works fine for you on 3.8.2 I advise you to not upgrade. Take a look to the change-log to see if any change important to you has been done.\n\nSQLite 3.8.2 is the latest stable and supported version for Ubuntu 14.04.\nSQLite 3.11.1 is the package aimed at Ubuntu 15.04 and is currently only present in the Vivid Vervet repository.\nRefer here for more information.\n\nIf you still want to upgrade :\nOn Ubuntu 15.04 you simply need to run the following command to update your SQLite package :\nsudo apt-get update    \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nOn Ubuntu 14.04 you have to download and install Precompiled Binaries for Linux available on SQLite website.\n\nA: I doubt that any major changes would be made in a minor release change from 3.8.2 - 3.8.11. \nIf SQLite uses Semantic Versioning like many projects do, the only time major changes that would affect compatibility are made is between major versions (eg. 3.x.x -> 4.x.x in this case).  Thus, you should be okay to upgrade it, but of course you should read over the changelogs for confirmation.\nAs for the proper way to do it, if you keep your system up to date, then you will have the most up to date version of SQLite3 available to your Ubuntu release available in the official repositories. You can make sure of this by running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\nAs it stands currently, the newest version of SQLite3 available to 14.04 LTS is 3.8.2, as per this page. The latest version available through official repositories period is the 3.8.11.1 release, available to the 15.10 release.\nThus, if you want to use 3.11.x on your system, you will have to do it manually from sources provided by SQlite.\n\nA: Yes, it can\nJust follow instructions at the last lines in this dockerfile https://github.com/disarticulate/docker-python-sqlite and fresh libsqlite3.so will be installed to /usr/lib\nThen discover actual placement of system wide libsqlite3.so (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, for ex) and correct symlinks to be pointed to /usr/lib/libsqlite3.so been compiled earlier\n", "Q: Obtain launch command for application from its icon returned by dash app lens What is the general way to find out the command used by the dash app lens to launch an app from its corresponding icon?\nI'm in the habit of clicking on the Ubuntu icon in the upper left corner (which I believe is called the \"dash app lens\") and typing the generic name of an application (such as \"skype\") to launch the application by clicking on its icon returned from the resulting search.\nHowever, if I want to add an application via the \"Startup Applications Preferences\" I need to know the command used by the dash app lens when clicking on the application's icon.  For skype that's easy enough as its simply \"skype\", but not everything is that simple.\n\nA: You can find almost all software shortcuts that appear in Dash in /usr/share/applications directory.\nIf you right-click a .desktop file and select \"properties\" you will see the command that is executed, when you click on the icon in Dash. \n", "Q: problem deleting MBR data and GPT data I am trying to install Ubuntu alongside windows 8 for the first time so I know nothing about Ubuntu and I deleted what so-called MBR or GPT data or both using Ubuntu live by typing (sudo gdisk /dev/sda) to the terminal, now I can't access my all partitions that were shown while using Ubuntu live and I can't boot to windows 8 again and I am typing this problem using Ubuntu live. \nCan anyone tell me how to fix this ?\n\nA: Typing sudo gdisk /dev/sda will not itself destroy data; gdisk loads partition table data into memory but will only write changes if you type w (or certain other commands) to save the changes. Furthermore, damaging the partitions would require using certain destructive commands, like d (to delete a partition) or o (to create a fresh partition table). gdisk will warn you you're about to overwrite your old partitions when you type w. Although it's entirely possible to trash a partition table with gdisk, doing so requires considerably more than just launching the program on the disk. I say all this to point out that it's unclear from your description precisely what you've done or what the state of your disk is. Without that information, answers will be at least a little bit speculative, although an educated guess might still be helpful to you.\nIf you want to provide more information so that we can give answers that are better than guesses, please run the following commands from an Ubuntu live boot:\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\nsudo parted -l\nsudo efibootmgr -v\n\nNote that in the first two of commands, -l is a lowercase L, not a digit 1. Edit your question and post the output, or post the output to a pastebin site and post the URL in your question or in a reply to this answer.\nFor a more shot-in-the-dark response without further information, I can make two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could contact your manufacturer or Microsoft to obtain a Windows installation disc image and use it to re-install Windows. You can then re-run the Ubuntu installation, but be more careful to not damage your system. This may be a good option if your disk doesn't contain personal data you need to recover. In fact, this article describes how to obtain Windows installation media from Microsoft legally. Doing so will have the advantage that your fresh installation will lack bloatware provided by your computer's manufacturer.\n\n*If you want to recover your system to the way it was before, and if your diagnosis of a trashed partition table is accurate, then using TestDisk may enable you to recover your partitions. There are numerous questions and answers on this site, and across the Internet, about using TestDisk, so consult them if you need more help on using this tool. I'm not 100% sure that your diagnosis is correct, though; it could be that your boot loader is damaged or there's some other lesser problem. In such a case, TestDisk won't do any good, and could actually create new problems. Posting the output of the commands I specified earlier will help us understand what's going on and provide better guidance.\n\n", "Q: Can't delete a route with 0.0.0.0 gateway I'm trying to set up my routes in a way that will allow me to connect to Vagrant box of Solum demo.\nMy routing table contains, but is not limited to, following routes:\n$ route -n\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     9      0        0 wlan0\n192.168.76.0    192.168.76.2    255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 vboxnet0\n192.168.76.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 vboxnet0\n\nI'm suspecting the third route (automatically generated on Vagrant box startup) is interfering with the second route (created manually), so I'm trying to delete it.\nHowever, using either of following commands\n$ sudo route del 192.168.76.0 gw 0.0.0.0\n$ sudo route del 192.168.76.0\n\nreturns:\nSIOCDELRT: No such process\n\nwhich usually pops up when route can't find the route.\nOn the other hand, using\n$ sudo route del 192.168.76.0/24 gw 0.0.0.0\n$ sudo route del 192.168.76.0/24\n\nyields:\nroute: netmask 000000ff doesn't make sense with host route\nUsage: route [-nNvee] [-FC] [<AF>]           List kernel routing tables\n(rest of usage)\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is there a reason I can't remove that route? Am I wrong in assuming that it interferes with the one I set up?\n(I'm using Ubuntu 14.04+).\n\nA: To delete a single route from a route table, you need to specify enough parameters so a unique match with one of the routes can be made. \nIf you want to delete a whole subnet (as opposed to a single host) you need to both use the -net flag and some indication of the scope of the network address, i.e. either the netmask parameter (e.g. 255.255.255.0) or a number like /24 (meaning that the first 24 bits are the network number, and the remaining 8 are used for hosts). In your case, both\nsudo route del -net 192.168.76.0/24\nand \nsudo route del -net 192.168.76.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 \nwould have worked.\n(thanks to @nephente for useful additions)\n\nA: Comment made by Jos is almost correct:\n$ sudo route del -net 192.168.76.0/24 removes the route.\n", "Q: UPSmon and DLink-320 Sharecenter I have a UPS unit attached to the D-Link 320 ShareCenter, a SOHO 2-bay NAS.

Probably your installation does not look for packages in the directory where Biopython installs its files.\nStep 1 - Checking the Python PATH and Biopython installation directory:\nPlease check your Python 2's PATH setting with the following command:\npython -c \"import sys; print('\\n'.join(sys.path))\"\n\nAccording to the package content of python-biopython version 1.64, it will install the Bio package directory in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/, so if this directory is missing in your Python PATH, we have spotted the error cause.\nStep 2 - Trying a temporary fix:\nYou can add a directory to the Python PATH variable by setting the shell's environment variable PYTHONPATH before starting the interpreter:\nPYTHONPATH=\"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages\" python\n\nIn this Python session you should now be able to use the Biopython package. After you verified that it works, we can continue with...\nStep 3 - Making the fix permanent:\nPython has one directory where it looks for path configuration files (*.pth). We find out which directory this is in your installation with the command:\nPythonSiteDir=$(python -c \"import site; site._script()\" --user-site)\necho $PythonSiteDir\n\nThis first stores the path in the variable $PythonSiteDir and then outputs it to the terminal. In your case, it will probably show the directory /home/alex/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages, but if not, please use your respective directory instead.\nWe have to place our custom .pth file into this directory, so first we make sure that we don't accidentally overwrite an existing file by checking which path configuration files already exist there. To avoid much typing, we use the variable we created earlier:\nls ${PythonSiteDir}/*.pth\n\nAll file names displayed by this command do already exist and may not be used.  Assuming that biopython_directory.pth was not in the list, we will now create this file and let it contain the path where Biopython is installed:\necho \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages\" > ${PythonSiteDir}/biopython_directory.pth\n\nThat was all. The only thing left by now is to test whether it worked. You can either just start using Biopython again or you can first check the current Python Path with the command from above:\npython -c \"import sys; print('\\n'.join(sys.path))\"\n\nSource/inspiration for step 3: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12311321/4464570\n\nA: I'd like to answer as a comment, but I need some reputation to write comments.

I had this problem, and all I know about it is that it is related to the default PS/2 driver on 14.04 (it don't support SynPS/2 -I have the same touchpad-). You can confirm it by using an USB external mouse: it will work.\nThen, go to terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nEnter your password, wait for updates. Reboot... if your Synaptics touchpad still don't work, then:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nEnter your password, wait for updates... with this packages you will get also some extras like Microsoft fonts. So you will see a license agreement on terminal... use the 'TAB' button on keyboard to select the 'Ok' option and press Enter.\nOnce your system is updated, reboot... your touchpad should work after it.\nAbraham Medina\n", "Q: How to make /home point to another partition? I had moved /home to another partition by following these steps:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\nNow I have reinstalled ubuntu by choosing the option to delete all previous files. After the installation, my /home directory is in the same partition as the root while my old /home is still intact in the other partition. Can I make /home point to the other partition while keeping my original files?\n\nA: Before we start\nMake a fresh backup of all your data on an external drive.\nOn installation\nWhen installing Ubuntu with defaults it will always create then HOME directory in the root of our newly installed OS. In case we do not want this we'd have to choose \"Something else\" on installation to then partition our drive according to our (non-default) needs.\nThen we can choose to install on a root partition (on mount point /) and  also mount another partition as HOME (mount point /home).\nOn the screen there please note the small boxes () where we choose to format a partition.\n\n*\n\n*We may want to format the root partition / holding our newly installed OS. All data on that partition will be deleted.\n\n*We may however not want to format our HOME partition as we would like to keep our data there. Formatting will delete those.\n\n*We then need to tell the installer to mount our previous HOME partiton to /home. This is done by clicking on Change... after we had selected this partition. Again, take care to have \"Format this partition\" unticked.\n\nExample:\nFor a separate HOME partition the screen may then look similar to this:\n\nIn the example above we will install Ubuntu, and format /sda1 to mount it on the mount point /. We will keep an exisiting swap partition on /sda5, and we will have an additional partition /sdb5 that we chose to mount as HOME on /home. Format option is ticked and greyed out in this example because it was an unformatted drive.\nAfter installation\nIn case we had already installed Ubuntu but forgot to tell it to use another partition as HOME we simply edit our /etc/fstab to define the partition we want to mount as HOME on boot. Such an entry may look similar to this:\nUUID=<uuid of partition to use>    /home    ext4    defaults   0  2\n\nIf, after a reboot, everything is to our liking we could delete the contents of our previous /home directory but after a fresh install it is not really populated much, so we could also just leave it in place.\nFor more details on these steps see my answer to the following question\n\n*\n\n*Move home folder to second drive\nNote that the directory name /home will still reside on the root partition to  be used as a mount point.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS wifi disconnects/reconnects constantly I've recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Desktop using USB alongside with Windows 10.

I have always been a Windows user and the whole Ubuntu system is completely new to me.\nI have a 1 Tb hard disk which under Win7 was separated into 3 partitions -C (system part), D and E. I keep my movies, music and files on D, used C for installed programs and Kept E completely free. When I installed Ubuntu 15.04 I selectedd E partition as Linux' system dir. After installation however, that E partition completely disappeared. I can still see my C and D, but E is not visible on neither Win nor Linux. In win's disk manager it is displayed as unattached? space, while on Linux it shows as Linux filesystem. I can't understand what's going on and will be really thankful for any replies :)\nP.S Here's a screenshot if it helps somehow.\nhttp://prikachi.com/images.php?images/600/8372600z.png\n\nA: Windows use NTFS partitions; Linux, ext4... Linux is able to read and write NTFS without need of any tweaks, but our loved Windows is unable to do the opposite: it does not support natively ext4 partitions. But don't dismay, because it can be fixed using Ext2File, an open source Linux ext2/ext3/ext4 file system driver for Windows systems... you can find it here.\nWhen you're installing, you can make it start automatically when Windows boots... I suggest you not to enable write support in order to avoid any troubles: first, ext4 writing support is not ready yet; second, windows could do messy things. With this application you can assign a letter to any Linux partition.\nThere is a blog that talks about this utility usage, it's on spanish but it has some pictures you could use as a guide. Hope it works for you as it did for me.\nAbraham Medina\nPD: Linux names NTFS partitions with its storage capacity... something like \"329 GB volume\". You won't see your Linux partition this way, but \"File System\".\n\nA: *\n\n*Linux does not name partitions with letters C, D, like in Windows.\n\n*Linux partitions can not be accessed from Windows, unless special drivers are installed there.\n\n*If you installed Ubuntu to your \"E\" partition, it is the normal situation that it is not \"seen\" from Windows and is used by Ubuntu without any C, D, etc. letters.\n\n*You can browse the Linux partition by clicking \"Computer\" in you Nautilus file manager.\nSo, there is no problem at all.\n\nA: You can see windows partitions from ubuntu. To mount windows partitions in ubuntu some changes needed in windows OS. 1) Go to power option 2) choose what the power buttons do 3) below in shutdown setting  turn off fast startup setting 4) save changes.

(Pmw 2.0.0) Problem:\nI'd like to install Pmw 2.0.0 (project page here) so that I can use it with tkinter in python3. The setup script from the package detects which version of python you're using and installs the version that is appropriate for your system (Ubuntu 15 in my case). I can't find any references to switches to make it install the 2.0.0 instead of 1.3.3(the Python 2.7 version), nor have I been able to get the script to install to the python3 libraries.\nWhat I've done so far:\nI've changed the python version detector in the setup script from\nif sys.version_info[0]<3:\n    version='2.0.0' # really '1.3.3'\n    packages=['Pmw', 'Pmw.Pmw_1_3_3', 'Pmw.Pmw_1_3_3.lib',]\n\nto\nif sys.version_info[0]<2:\n    version='2.0.0' # really '1.3.3'\n    packages=['Pmw', 'Pmw.Pmw_1_3_3', 'Pmw.Pmw_1_3_3.lib',]\n\nto attempt to force the installer to default to the python3 version, which it does, but it installs them in the python2.7 libraries (/usr/local/lib/python2.7/distpackages).\nWhat I want to do:\nI'm looking for a way to force the installer to put the 3.4-compatible package into the python3 libraries. If that means getting it to install both packages in their respective correct directories, that's fine, too. I'm stumped about what to try next.\n\nA: I have just installed Pmw 2.0.0 using python3 on LinuxMint 17. I downloaded the current release candidate from here and performed the following three steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*python3 setup.py config\n\n*python3 setup.py build\n\n*python3 setup.py install\nI assume that you typed python instead of python3, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

That should fix the issue.\nYou can undo this setting by\nsudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi-opt.conf\n\n\nA: Here's an alternate answer which doesn't disable 802.11n. Blacklist the acer_wmi module. Create a file called /etc/modprobe.d/acer_wmi.conf and put this inside of it:\n# acer_wmi conflicts with iwlwifi/nm which this HP x360 laptop uses\n# (Your name, today's date)\nblacklist  acer_wmi\n\nBy the way, I tried this on an HP Pavilion x360 Convertible m1-u001dx.\n\nA: (edited as requested)\nFor everyone out there having problems with the wifi in this laptop, this was what truly worked for me (adapting some commands from Arch to Ubuntu by googling). This was tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10 successfully without requiring any other instructions.\nThe answer from hackerb9 to deactivate de acer_wmi module and instructions from here: rtl8723be wifi connection issues solved by antenna selection\nJust change the following commands that appear in that guide for this ones:\n\nArch command\npacman -S base-devel git linux-headers iw rfkill wireless_tools\nUbuntu command \nsudo apt-get install build-essential iw linux-headers-generic git  rfkill wireless-tools\n\nArch command\nsudo mkinitcpio -p linux\nUbuntu command\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nAnd my configuration file looks like this:\n$ cat /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf\noptions rtl8723be fwlps=N ips=N swlps=N swenc=Y disable_watchdog=1 ant_sel=2\nNOTE: Don't update the kernel of the OS if you are not on a wired network, updating the kernel will require that you repeat the steps on the guide.\nAs last step:\nsudo echo \"blacklist acer-wmi\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf \nThen reboot and that's it!\nHope this work for you!\n\nA: Connect to the internet by some other way and install the 4.8+ kernel\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install linux-generic-hwe-16.04\n\nYou also need firmware for this device. Update your system by\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\n\nand the firmware will be installed.\nReboot and the wireless device should work.\nTo get it working out of the box, you need to install Ubuntu 16.04.2+ that has support of this device.\n(I used a USB Ethernet connector for internet access. )\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.3 installation I'm trying to install ubuntu 14.04.3 LOS with a USB. When I run the install it prompts me through the install but it's not installing over windows. I'd like it to format the drive windows is on and install the boot loader to that drive. (SATA1). When I install ubuntu and re insert my USB it loads up the selections to install or try without installing. I ran through the install like 3 times. When I remove the USB nothing not even Windows will boot.\n\nA: espero ayudarte, verás ,para instalar Ubuntu asi como cualquier distro linux juntu con Windows,  depes particionar el disco duro,  por lo que tendrás que investigar que son particiones, hasta ahi muy bien, luego debes saber configurar la BIOS es posible que usted tenga UEFI que creo que es una BIOS que funciona con una interfaz gráfica o algo así,  pero lo que realmente importa es que tengas en cuenta el orden de arranque de los sistemas operativos,  primero debes poner ubuntu, luego Windows,  si todo sale bien, entonces cuándo enciendas tu máquina veras una interfaz textual , por lo general morada, ese programa de entrada se llama GRUB y permite decidir cual sistema operativo SO correr,\n●intenta cuidadosamente configurar la BIOS las formas que sea posible,  pero hazlo con información a la mano.\n●no tiene sentido que reinstales Ubuntu. \nESPERO HABERTE AYUDADO :)\n", "Q: How to Copy Image From Remote Desktop Can some one please help me to copy image from Remote Windows Desktop to my local Ubuntu 15 Desktop.\nI had tried using many Paint tools, but still no luck.\nI can just copy text but not the image.\nThanks in Advance.\n\nA: Are you using vbox to run remote windows? In that case the vbox guest additions package will allow you to create a shared folder (you can set this up in the same place as you set up your machine) or access a usb stick. Otherwise, there is the slightly less convenient way of emailing or dropboxing it.\n", "Q: Cron Wont Run - Ubuntu Server 14.04 So I've created a backup script that tar's up files, rsyncs them to a remote server, and removes the tar afterwards.

Without any real details in the syslog, I've run into a roadblock.\n\nA: The command is running since you're seeing it in syslog. I imagine you don't have a hashbang at the top of your shell script, are using bash syntax while running the job in sh, or are using a non-fully-qualified path (using just echo instead of /bin/echo). There's this answer to that problem:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/94456/how-to-change-cron-shell-sh-to-bash\n\nA: your cron job will create backup every day 04 AM every minute . your are creating backup every minutes so it may be your backup process take more than 1 minute. change first * to either 0 or some other. if you want to create backup once a day then use \n0 04 * * * /home/user/scripts/backup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1\n\nit will create backup everyday 04 AM. \nor \nif you want to create backup every four hour then use like \n0 */4 * * * /home/user/scripts/backup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1\n\nno need to add sh. make sure you are giving full path of script. \nyou can learn more from How do I set up a Cron job? or any other blogs. \nalso make sure you are setting this as a root user. i can't talk about your shell because i don't know what you written in shell. \ngo through Reasons why crontab does not work this is good explanation to find basic crontab issues. also you can see my answer for some help here\n\nA: Try to restart cron service.\n/etc/init.d/crond start\n\nand then check your process running or not.\n", "Q: Wifi wont connect at start So I am sure it's a simple fix but I couldn't find anything on the forums or Google.\nPretty much when I boot up it wont connect to my wifi. I have to disable Wi-Fi then enable it for it to connect. So, Is there a way around this or a fix for it as repeating this constantly gets tedious. If you need any info, I'm fairly new to this so could you also explain how to get it!\nThanks ahead of time.\n\nA: Can you just click \"connect\"? Sometimes it helps to set a connection as \"system connection\", it can connect automatically then. \n\nA: You could set up a .sh script to have this in it:\nnmcli nm wifi off\nnmcli nm wifi on\n\nThen using this:\nstart on startup\ntask\nexec /path/to/aboveScript.sh\n\nSave this in a .conf file in ~/.config/upstart\nTo automatically start-up the script on start up!\n", "Q: Trusty OpenStack Kilo on Juju MAAS fails to create instance Ubuntu Trusty 14.04.2 LTS on MAAS controller and using Juju, the Dashboard and the juju-gui console.\nNo matter what I try, I can't get an instance to spin up.

Although I suspect that this is not currently possible, I would just like to ask because it would be something very useful in my opinion. Because when I close my lid and I am in the GUI my computer suspends and then requires a password to be unlocked. However if I do the same in console, there is no suspend and it doesn't ask me for a password to log back in again.\nNow this can be a potential security risk so I was wondering if there was a way to pause everything running through console when the lid is closed, and so that when the machine awakes, you have to enter your password back into the console window so that it 'unlocks' your session? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.04. When I say the console, I mean the TTYs.\nI have had a look at TTY[1-6]: Lock screen after delay (like a screensaver), however I do not feel that it fully answers my question, especially about pausing anything running so that it can continue upon resume.\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: The other question that muru has linked in the comments ( TTY[1-6]: Lock screen after delay (like a screensaver)   ) offers us the tool to locking the tty , vlock. At the simplest level , you can combine vlock -a with pm-suspend into a .bashrc function or a script. Here's mine:\n$ cat lockTTY.sh \n#!/bin/bash\n(sleep 3; sudo pm-suspend) &\nvlock -a \n\nWhat is happening here ? Basically we're launching pm-suspend with delay in subshell , in background. Meanwhile we use vlock -a to lock all the ttys. After 3 seconds, the laptop suspends. \nThe catch here however is the sudo pm-suspend part. You have to prevent sudo from asking you password for pm-suspend.  In order to do that, we add the following line at the end of /etc/sudosers file\n$USERNAME ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend\n\nOf course , replace $USERNAME with your actual username. You might call sudo visudo to open that file with your default text editor set in /etc/alternatives/editor , just to be safe, but any editor called with proper permissions will do.\nWhat does this script allows us to do ?  Suspend and lock with processes still running. vlock -a has big advantage in preventing switching to other consoles, so it's not just one console being locked, but all of them - you cannot just switch to another tty if one is locked. \nYou could also suspend first and lock second, i.e. call pm-suspend first and vlock -a second. But that means upon resume there is possibility someome may see your screen for a fraction of a second before vlock kicks in.\nWhat would be the simple and dirty solution in case you don't trust vlock and don't want to install it ? Create a script /etc/pm/sleep.d/10_lockTTY with the following contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase \"${1}\" in\n        hibernate|sleep)\n        ;;\n        resume|thaw)\n     for NUM in $(seq 1 6); do service tty$NUM restart; done         \n    ;;\nesac\n\nThis will reset all ttys upon return from suspend, but mind - any processes you had there will be killed.\n", "Q: NTFS Corrupted.

Thanks\n\nA: The Dell XPS 9343 microphone is currently broken on kernel 3.16.\n\nYou have to use kernel 3.19 which contains a fix for the microphone.\nThere are two ways to do it :\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually install kernel 3.19 on your current Ubuntu installation.\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-lts-vivid linux-image-generic-lts-vivid\n\n\n*Upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04 (which has kernel 3.19).\nI wrote a full guide on how to do it on this laptop.\n\nA: Something that worked for me (on Ubuntu 16.04 with kernel 4.4.0-87) was to install pavucontrol and set it as the 'fallback' on the input devices tab. It seems that the default audio settings controller in Ubuntu 16.04 wasn't picking up the internal mic properly, but pavucontrol spotted it fine (the levels were jumping when I made noise), and I just needed to set it as the default (fallback?).I got the idea from here even though I am not using archlinux.\n", "Q: uninstall ubuntu 8.10 and grub how do I remove ubuntu and grub from my vista system and regain access to my second hard disk where ubuntu is installed.

I have been using ubuntu for 4 years and have never used red hat so any information will help. Thank you :).\nI apologize for the formatting of this post as I am on my blackberry.   \n\nA: RHEL/CentOS uses rpm for dpkg, yum (soon dnf) for apt-get. Packages are named differently, repositories are of course different.\nBasic commands, of course, are the same, for a suitable definition of \"basic\".\n\nA: As muru said too, basic commands for both distros are same but apt-get won't work as it uses yum.\nimho apt-get is simplest when it comes to package managers, i personally like pacman more because of its speed, yum is bearable.\nAlso not all softwares available for ubuntu would be available for redhat, in case you want to use some software not available for red hat you will have to compile it from source to make it work.\nIf these thing don't bother you then go for redhat its a good distro and has its own ups and downs. \n", "Q: Problem with Adobe Audition 1.5 (running under Wine) I'd had always been using Adobe Audition 1.5 (software created to Windows), and now I use it with Lubuntu through Wine.

I am in the process of dual-booting my Windows 10 PC to also run Ubuntu 20.04 on it. I have both a 240 GB SSD and a 1TB HDD. The SSD is for the Windows 10 OS, and the HDD is for my files/documents/everything else.\nI have just freed up 40 GB on the SSD and 200 GB on the HDD to install Ubuntu.

If so, how?\nI am very new to Linux, so please provide step-by-step solution.\n\nA: YES YOU CAN , Just start the ubuntu installation setup and when you reach partitioning menu , 'Do Something Else' (or manual partitioning). Here you will be able to make partitions on whichever disk you want and then assign them as 'swap space' or '/home'. just be sure to make a '/' too ( This is where rest of your os will go ). Good luck. \n", "Q: Checking extensions on command parameters? So I'm running Ubuntu and what I want to do is check to see if $1 and $2 have certain extensions and if they exist. If they don't exist or have the wrong extension, the script ends. If they are right then it continues on with the code. \nv1=\"$1\"  \nv2=\"$2\"  \n\nif [[ ! \"$1\"=\"*.txt\" || \"$2\"=\"*.dat\" || -e \"$1\" ]]; then  \necho \"The file is ending\"  \nexit  \nfi  \n\necho \"Starting rest of code\" \n\nThats how I would like it to work. Basically it assigns v1 and v2 to their respected command parameters. Then it runs an if statement to see if they meet the requirements. So for example, if $1 is not a .txt file or if $2 is not a .dat file or if $1 doesn't exist, then it exits and displays The File is ending. However, if they do meet the requirements then the code continues and displays Starting rest of code.\nAs it stands right now, it wont continue, even if the right files are entered. Instead it exits no matter what. \n\nA: You can use the =~ operator for regular expression matching:\n#!/bin/bash\nv1=\"$1\"\nv2=\"$2\"\npat1='.*\\.txt$'\npat2='.*\\.dat$'\nif [[ ! ($v1 =~ $pat1 && $v2 =~ $pat2 && -e $v1) ]]; then\n    echo Ending program\n    exit\nfi\necho Continuing program\n\n\nA: What you are doing wrong is checking $1 against '.txt' where $1 will not contain only the extension but the whole file's name. For instance, if there's a file named\nfile1.txt\n\nthen $1 will hold file1.txt as value which is not equal to .txt.\nWhat you should do is get file's extension first from $1 and then check them against type (without dot)\nv1=\"$1\"\nv2=\"$2\"\next1=${v1##*.}\next2=${v2##*.}\nif [ \"$ext1\" != \"txt\" ] || [ \"$ext2\" != \"dat\" ] || [ ! -e \"$1\" ]; then\necho \"The file is ending\"\nexit\nfi\necho \"Starting rest of code\"\n\n\nA: Try taking advantage of the basename command.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ \"$(basename $1 .txt)\" = \"$1\" -o \"$(basename $2 .dat)\" = \"$2\" ]; then\n    echo \"the file is ending\" >&2\n    exit 1\nfi\n\necho \"starting rest of code\"\n\nThat code snippet tries stripping off a given extension and comparing the stripped version to the original:  if it's unchanged, then the filename does not have the given extension.  Note the inverted logic (if the strings are equal, then the filename doe not have the given extension).\nThis solution works with the standard shell or with bash.\n", "Q: I want to change the resolution to 1600x900 Hola tengo recién instalado Ubuntu 15.04 y una placa de video nvidia GeForce 6150SE nForce 430, de 32 bits y una frecuencia de 60 Hz.

So I built a tower that barely scrapes by. My uncle just told me that he uses Ubuntu for one of his computers and it can be put onto the laptop through a USB So I installed the Ubuntu USB loader and the latest Ubuntu system.

When I boot into GNOME Shell 3.14.4 about three out of four times, my mouse is about half the size it should be.\nI imagine this is due to Gnome incorrectly setting my mouse's scale to 1, instead of 2.

That 14G total is less than half the disk size. Where is the rest going?\nMy Linux knowledge does not go a lot deeper. \nIs it possible for files to no show up here? Is it possible to have space allocated in any other way?\n\nA: To add to the excellent answer by muru : \n\n\n*\n\n*df shows the size on the disk, \n\n*and du shows the total size of the files content.\n\n\nMaybe what you don't see with du is the appearance of many, many small files... (look on the last column of df -i and see if the number of inodes (ie, of files) increases a lot overtime too)\nIf you happen to have, say, 1'000'000 (1 million) tiny 1-byte files, du will count that as 1'000'000 bytes total, let's say 1Mb (... purists, please don't cringe)\nBut on disk, each file is made of 2 things: \n\n\n*\n\n*1 inode (pointing to the file's data), and that inode can by itself be 16kb(!), \n\n*And each file's data (= the file's content) is put on disk blocks, and those blocks can't contain several file's data (usually...), so your 1 byte of data will occupy at least 1 block\n\n\nThus, a million files 1-byte files will occupy 1'000'000'000 * size_of_a_block total space for the data, plus 1'000'000'000 * size_of_an_inode of inode's size... That can amount to several Gb of disk usage for 1 million \"1-byte\" files.\nIf you have 1024-byte blocks, and another 256 bytes of inode size, your 1'000'000 files will be reported as roughly 1Mb by du, but will count as roughly 1.25Gb on disk (as seen by df) ! (or even 2Gb if each inode also has to be on 1 dedicated disk block... I don't know if that's the case)\n\nA: If there's an invisible growth in disk space, a likely culprit would be deleted files. In Windows, if you try to delete a file opened by something, you get an error. In Linux, the file will be marked as deleted, but the data will be retained until the application lets go. In some cases, this can be used as a neat way to clean up after yourself - application crashes won't prevent temporary files from being cleaned.\nTo look at deleted, still-used files:\nlsof -b 2>/dev/null | grep deleted\n\nYou may have a large number of deleted files - that in itself is not a problem. A single deleted file getting large is a problem.\nA reboot should fix this, but if you don't want to reboot, check the applications involved (first column in lsof output) and restart or close reasonable looking ones.\nIf you ever see something like:\nzsh   1724   muru   txt   REG   8,17   771448   1591515  /usr/bin/zsh (deleted)\n\nWhere the application and the deleted files are the same, that probably means the application was upgraded. You can ignore those as a source of large disk usage (but you should still restart the program so that bug-fixes apply).\nFiles in /dev/shm are shared memory objects and don't occupy much space on disk (an inode number at most, I think). They can also be safely ignored. Files named vteXXXXXX are log files from a VTE-based terminal emulator (like GNOME Terminal, Terminator, etc.). These could be large, if you have a terminal window open with lots (and I mean lots) of stuff being output.\n\nA: If /dev/vda1 is filling up, it might be caused by Jenkins or Docker (or etc) and you might have to use lsof command in order to clean logs and set it's size. \n", "Q: libre office word completion not working I am using ubuntu and in Libre office, the word completion option under Auto correct is not working.

Sometimes I saw statements like \n\nDo not use BtrFS versions older than 0.20rc1.\n\nHow can I find out which version is in my Kernel?\n\nA: TLDR\nStarting at Linux kernel v2.6.32 (December 2009) the BTRFS module abandoned it own separate versioning scheme. The last version before that moment was v0.19 according to official changelog.\nOriginal answer\nThere are two ways to implement a filesystem in Linux:\neither merge the code into the kernel, or build it as a user-space application using a \"Filesystem in Userspace\" framework (FUSE). \nFile systems implemented in kernel have better efficiency than those on top of FUSE (but this difference diminishes in time, as FUSE becomes more and more mature). \nBTRFS is implemented only in kernel as a kernel module named btrfs, so it's version is tightly coupled with the kernel version. And a BTRFS kernel team contributed a lot of generic code to kernel in the process of implementing their FS. Normally you would get version information of the btrfs kernel module using command modinfo btrfs | grep -i ver, but in my case (Ubuntu 14.04) this field does not exist for btrfs. \nYes, a lot of things are implemented in kernel. That's why Linux is said to have monolithic kernel. In GNU HURD you'd have btrfs as a separate service (something like \"driver\") if only GNU HURD would ever be production-ready.\n\nIt is not true, that the btrfs module version is the same as btrfs-tools. They usually coincide, but they not necessarily have to. (There was a time, where btrfs-tools shipped with Ubuntu was one year behind the latest version compatible with the kernel). Btrfs-tools is intended to be backward-compatible, so a newer version can be run on older kernels, perhaps with reduced functionality if some btrfs features are not present in the kernel yet. \nAgain, BTRFS version is tightly coupled with kernel version during the development phase. Effectively there is no such thing as \"btrfs driver version\" other than in kernel.btrfs git source code commits. Or any other FS version except for file systems written on top of FUSE.\n\nA: Starting with Linux kernel v2.6.32 (December 2009) the BTRFS module abandoned it own separate versioning scheme.\nSince then just use uname -r to get the kernel version.\nThe last version before that was v0.19 according to official changelog.\n", "Q: how to undo powertop autotune settings? I installed powertop in order to increase my laptop battery life. However, after the first usage I wasn't able to shut down my laptop. And later some strange things started to happen: laptop suddenly just shut down (once) and some USB hardware disabled.\nHow to undo powertop autotune settings?\n\nA: Usually sudo powertop --auto-tune is not persisted. Thus a reboot sets everything back to normal. If only one setting is bothering you (and you have an idea which it is) you can always sudo powertop and on the last tab change the appropriate setting back from Good to Bad (by selecting that line and hitting Enter).\n", "Q: Mate, use gnome-screenshot instead of mate-screenshot I am a big fan of Mate desktop. Simple and very functional.\nBut there one thing I'd address to the mate desktop: its screenshot utility is too poor.\nThe very single feature I miss there is being able to take a screenshot of only a part of the screen. It is apparently available with gnome-screenshot as from this post: What screenshot tools are available?\nIs there any way I could replace mate-screenshot to gnome-screenshot?\nI tried sudo apt-get install gnome-screenshot but then if I try to launch it, I have\n▶ gnome-screenshot\n** Message: Unable to use GNOME Shell's builtin screenshot interface, resorting to fallback X11.\n\nBesides, I really need the shortcuts (the whole point is to achieve it in two clicks), so even if I get it working, I'll also need this.\nFYI, I was using shutter earlier, but removed it because it was lacking the desktop shortcuts and sometimes very buggy (need to hard shutdown the system).\n\nA: I resolved the same issue by adding the --interactive option\ngnome-screenshot --interactive\n\n\nA: Actually, mate-screenshot does have the utility you want, (see man mate-screenshot) so there's no need to install an extra package. In a terminal, you can use the -a flag\nmate-screenshot -a\n\nThis turns the pointer into a cross-hair and you can click and drag to select the area you want to grab.\nYou can set a custom shortcut for it (for example shift+prt sc like gnome-screenshot) in:\nSystem > Preferences > Hardware > Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nclick the + Add button to add a custom one.\nYou may well find that using the command mate-screenshot -a in the keyboard shortcut does not work, in which case you need to modify the command to call bash and set DISPLAY... First check the variable in a terminal:\necho $DISPLAY\n\nand take note of the output. For me it's :0.0\nThen use this command in the shortcut setting:\nbash -c \"DISPLAY=:0.0 mate-screenshot -a\"\n\nReplacing :0.0 to match the output from echo $DISPLAY\n\nA: As @Zanna sais, mate-screenshot does have the availability of doing area screenshots.\nBut there is a well known bug (https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-utils/issues/37) which makes the command with this option fail.\nAs mentioned in the comments, the solution is to slighly delay the command:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 1\nexec /usr/bin/mate-screenshot $@\n\nwithin eg. /usr/local/bin/mate-screenshot and use it instead.\nIt changed my life, I keep using this feature now!\n", "Q: br_netfilter missing in ubuntu 14.04 I have the following problem when running docker.io:\n\nRunning modprobe bridge nf_nat br_netfilter failed with message: modprobe: WARNING: Module br_netfilter not found.\n\nI tried running modprobe br_netfilter which results in:\nmodprobe br_netfilter\nmodprobe: FATAL: Module br_netfilter not found.\n\nWhat can I do to install br_netfilter on my system?\nThanks!\nFrom the comments:\nuname -r\n3.16.0-49-generic\n\n.\napt-cache policy linux-image-3.16.0-49-generic\nlinux-image-3.16.0-49-generic:\n  Installed: 3.16.0-49.65~14.04.1\n  Candidate: 3.16.0-49.65~14.04.1\n  Version table:\n *** 3.16.0-49.65~14.04.1 0\n        500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-security/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n.\nfind /lib/modules/ -type f -name '*br_netfilter.ko'\n\nDid not return anything.

How can I install a TP-Link driver for my laptop on Ubuntu?\nWireless info: http://pastebin.com/JBJFwLDT\nlspci http://pastebin.com/2tUKBhne\n\nA: This is your wireless card:\n03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Qualcomm Atheros QCA9565 / AR9565 Wireless Network Adapter [168c:0036] (rev 01)\n    Subsystem: AzureWave Device [1a3b:2130]\n    Kernel driver in use: ath9k\n\nThat card is NOT a Dual Band*  card.  It only works on the 2.4GHz spectrum.  It will not work with 5GHz wireless networks.\n* (dual band means the card works with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks)\n\n\nSo I'll never reach the maximum internet speed on my laptop? –  Lurrdock (comments)\n\nSpeed isn't necessarily determined by which band your wireless card is on.  True, 5GHz band will be less cluttered, but you have to be closer to the access point because 5GHz doesn't travel as far, and doesn't penetrate walls and structural obstacles as well.\nSo, we go back to the speed of the wireless standards.\nThe current \"standard\" of wireless is N.  It's not new, but it's still the standard.  (AC is the latest standard, but N is still the most prevalent standard in use).\nThe maximum speed of a Wireless N(+) network theoretically is 150Mbps down/up over a single wireless channel.  (Wireless N, with the correct wireless card and router pairing, can support triple-channel bonding, which can get you a theoretical 450Mbps speed by connecting with three channels to the router/accesspoint).  However, this only refers to the data rate between a computer and the wireless access point/router and the rest of the internal network (such as computer-to-computer on your home network only) - it does not actually mean you'll get those speeds when surfing the internet or using it for things outside your internal network.\nHere's where that bottle neck comes into play.  The maximum speed of the average residential connection to the Internet (in the USA region I'm in) appears to be between 25 and 54Mbps download speed.\nEven with the Wireless N standard, most networks are never going to see the full potential speed a wireless standard would give them.  This is partly due to ideal conditions not existing - radio frequency collission because of radio waves, structural obstacles between a given computer and the wireless access point, etc. are all factors in why wireless networks don't actually give you their maximum rated theoretical speed.\nAn example of this is my network.  My network is a 150Mbps download, 25Mbps upload, from Comcast, and I never see those speeds over wireless, even with my computer right next to the Wireless Access Point, due to signal interference, and many other radio-related issues.  The only way to really achieve those speeds is through Ethernet connections to my switches and my network, which can reach up to 1000 Mbps up/down (Gigabit!).  However, speed is also impacted by number of devices on the network, so I have several devices that share the network.\n", "Q: How to connect two laptops with ethernet patch cable to share files I have the same problem as this question( How do I connect my desktop and my laptop using an ethernet cable to transfer files? ).\nI could not comment on the answer selected by OP, because of not having enough reputation.

Moreover, yes, I have googled, but could not find/understand a solution or got a solution to work for my problem.\n\nA: On the Linux machine run this command:\nsudo ifconfig address 169.254.5.1 netmask 255.255.0.0\n\nOn the windows machine, you will need to run a command prompt as Administrator and run this command:\nnetsh interface ip set address name=\"Local Area Connection\" static 169.254.5.2 255.255.0.0 169.254.5.1 1\n\nYou can replace the 169.254.*.* with whatever almost address you want, although it is highly recommended to stay in the 169.254.*.* block.\nKeep in mind that Windows will always say Unknown Network for an ad-hoc connection like this.  The only way to get around it is to buy a router or a switch.  If you want to enable Homegroup, then you'll need to change your network location (multiple ways to do so in Windows, covered here) to private/Home.\n", "Q: my windows os not showing when i try to create a dual boot I tried to install linux in another partition with my other os being windows but when the option for installing grub appeared it said they was no  other os on my system. How do i rectify this or what  error occurred for this to happen?\n\nA: GRUB2 does not recognizes Windows Vista/7/8/10 boot loader. But you really don't need to.\nEven so, you can install Ubuntu's distros without lose any data: just select the installation type option \"something else\" and resize the Windows partition (If you don't have enough space for Linux yet). Then, you can create the necessary partitions: a Swap partition with the same size as your RAM memory, and at least one ext4 partition to mount \"/\"... you can even set two partitions; one for the system (mount point \"/\") and one for the data (mount point \"/home\").\nNow you can install without worrying about losing data. But once you get your Ubuntu installation you won't be able to boot Windows... don't dispair: you can fix it by using Lilo, a program that allows you to restore Windows MBR (Master Boot Record):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lilo\nsudo lilo -M /dev/sda mbr\n\nOf course, you must be sure that your physical hard drive is \"/dev/sda\" (if you only have one Disk, it must be this... else, you can use Disks utility to verify).\nThen reboot, and you will be able to boot Windows (but only Windows). Now it's time to restore Linux boot (yes, another restore): donwload and install EasyBCD (http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/); an application to manage multiple boots. Here you can add a new entry on the boot list for Ubuntu (selecting GRUB2) and aiming to the ext4 partition where Linux is installed, and you can even decide what OS will be the default option. Don't be afraid, just make a backup of the MBR... EasyBCD allows you to. It have a very intuitive interface. You won't have any problem to use it, I hope.\nIt can happen, too, that some crazy future update on Ubuntu restore de GRUB2 original boot... then you won't be able to boot Windows; once again, don't dismay: this can be fixed using Lilo...\nsudo lilo -M /dev/sda mbr\n\nAbraham Medina.\n", "Q: Failed to bring machine into sleep via pm-suspend When execute pm-suspend, I got I/O error.\nAnd after checking other similar posts, didn't found a solution that fix the issue.\nThe OS on pc:\nThe pc has dual operating system:\n\n\n*\n\n*win8.1\n\n*mint mate 17.2 (3.16.0-38-generic #52~14.04.1-Ubuntu x86_64 GNU/Linux).\n\n\nThe secure boot is disabled, as well as win8's quick start.\nBehavior of pm-suspend:\nThe command try to sleep first, then the system wake up again 1 second later.\nSometimes after reboot pm-suspend could work, another reboot might cause it won't work again.\nThe key error tip from pm-suspend.log is:\nThu Sep 24 20:39:44 CST 2015: performing suspend\nsh: echo: I/O error\nThu Sep 24 20:39:45 CST 2015: Awake.\n\nI don't know how to check which part cause the I/O error.\n\nConfig files\n/etc/fstab\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

To be more specific I am aware about this method and have set the password many times when I have lost it before. \nMy problem - now my problem is that this method is not working. When I drop down to root shell it asks for root password again without which it does not progress. I do not have this password! What is the alternative then?? \n\nA: If you can access the root partition from another system, e.g. a live CD, you can as root from there edit /etc/shadow; first you have to chmod u+w shadow. Find the entry for root, it's probably the first one and looks something like this:\nroot:$6$asdG0[..etc...]ae/:15666:0:99999:7:::\n\nErase everything between the first two colons so you end up with:\nroot::15666:0:99999:7:::\n\nThen chmod u-w shadow. You can now reboot the system and root will have no password. You can just type root at the login prompt and it won't ask for one. You can then use passwd to set one.\nEdit 1\nBoot to the Live media. Open a terminal. Find out the device name for your primary disk. sudo fdisk-l will list all partitions.Like /dev/sda1\nMount this somewhere so we can use it:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nThen change directory\nsudo cd /mnt/etc\n\nchange privilage\nsudo chmod u+w shadow\n\nedit file like I write\nfrom\nroot:$6$asdG0[..etc...]ae/:15666:0:99999:7:::\n\nto\nroot::15666:0:99999:7:::\n\nthen\nu-w shadow\n\nReboot\n", "Q: Error while installing haskell i am installing haskell code is as follow\ngit clone git://github.com/ghc/ghc.git && cd ghc && ./sync-all get\ncd ghc && ./sync-all get cd ghc && ./boot && ./configure && make && make install\n\nwhen i try with ./sync-all get i get following error:\nCloning into 'ghc'...\n/bin/sh: 1: ./sync-all: not found\n\nwhen i try without ./sync-all in code i get following error\n    It seems you cloned this repository from GitHub.

I often upgrade to a new release of Ubuntu, think I could have got some malware and then have to use my LiveUSB to install a fresh install, however the LiveUSB is using an old version, so I was wondering if it possible to boot from a LiveUSB in order to download an Ubuntu ISO and then use the Startup Disk Creator to make another LiveUSB? So I would boot from one in order to make another.\nIs this possible or could there be any problems with doing this? The version of Ubuntu on my LiveUSB is Ubuntu GNOME 15.04, it's just that if I get infected with something I don't want to keep carry on installing an old version and then having to upgrade again, I would prefer just to create a LiveUSB with the latest version, however I have to be sure that my system is clean otherwise I could infect the new LiveUSB.\nClarification:\n15.04 is currently the latest stable release, however soon 15.10 will be released and I will upgrade to it, however if once I have upgraded I get a virus or something then I will have to do a fresh install of 15.04 and then upgrade again, what I would much prefer to do is to install a fresh install of 15.10 when it comes out, but make sure that it could not have anything injected into it.\n\nA: Sure you can do that as long as you have enough space for the new ISO. But honestly, I think that is quite paranoid. ;)\nAnd believe me, your live system that does not matter. Otherwise it would not be genuine and therefore a bad live system.\n\nA: Face it!\nYou need to start making nightly system back-ups on non-rewritable media (BlueRay?) and then restore your entire system to whatever it was before the infection.\nOn the other hand: One day you'll be a great security researcher as mal-ware seems to keep hunting you down, so you'll always be the first one to research the latest nastiness...\n;-)\n", "Q: How can I get read/write access to NFS share of Synology NAS? I have read access only to the mounted NFS share.  \nWith 'no squash mapping' set on the NAS, Ubuntu regular user gets Permission denied when trying to cd into the share and can only get read access by using sudo.\nUsing squash 'map all users to admin' setting, client regular user can cd into and has only read access to the share.

The vi Error message upon :w! command is:\n\"test.file\" E212: Can't open file for writing\n\nA: NFSv2/3 handles permissions solely based on UID and GID. File permissions on the server are matched against user- and group ids on client. That is why NFSv<4 is by design insecure in environments where users have root access to the client machines; UID spoofing is trivial in that case. \nNote that NFSv4 offers client and user authentication via Kerberos5. If authentication with username and password is needed, it is although often much easier to resort to Samba (SMB/CIFS) instead of setting up a Kerberos, even in pure Linux environments.\nTo at least prevent escalation of root privileges, NFS shares are exported by default with the option root_squash, which will map all client request coming from root (uid=0, gid=0) to anonuid and anongid. This behavior can be overridden with no_root_squash, granting root access to the export.\nHere, we see another drawback. To function properly, NFS basically requires you to have the same UID/GID on all machines. The files you want to access belong to 1026 and have permissions 755. You're user on the client has uid=1000. The GIDs don't match either, so you get world permissions only. Hence no write access.\nTo resolve this, you could do one of multiple things:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the NAS, change the owner of the files to 1000. You would maybe need to create that particular account. How this will affect other services, I cannot tell.\n\n*Change the UID of your local user to 1026. \n\n*Since you are the only one accessing the files on the server, you can make the server pretend that all request come from the proper UID.\nFor that, NFS has the option all_squash. It tells the server to map all request to the anonymous user, specified by anonuid,anongid. \nAdd the optionss all_squash,anonuid=1026,anongid=100 to the export in /etc/exports.\nBe cautious though, since this will make anyone mounting the export effectively the owner of those files!\nIf you share your network with people and their clients whom you not trust completely not to make mischief with your files, you really should look into a method of filesharing that offers authentication. In my opinion, Samba is the easiest way to achieve that. \n\nA: Do showmount -e 10.1.1.214 to see the export options. Permission denied error is coming from the NFS server itself. Try to change option from rw,user,auto to defaults.\n", "Q: No WebGL support for Google Chrome on Ubuntu 14.04 The 2 solutions/workarounds I found searching askubuntu didn't work so far.

A lot of installation instructions tell you to turn on a legacy boot mode but this requires a DOS-type of disk partition structure and the conflict between the two confuses the installer.\nIf you are able to set your 'BIOS' to uefi booting (and my installation eventually coped with secure boot too) then it would be worth reinstalling as the installer should pick this up and confirm that it's placing the bootloader in a 'system' directory (this is from memory, sorry, but in my case it was partition 2), otherwise it asks you where you want it and you (well, I) can easily give the wrong answer.\nIn my case I also tried to do a uefi install with a 32-bit system, and I later found that 64-bit was mandatory, but you look as though you have that sorted.\nI found the following 2 articles to be very helpful and authoritative in describing how to go about a UEFI installation:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nAllowing boot of Ubuntu on a Acer Aspire v5-531 with UEFI\nI hope these prove helpful - but in 9 months you have either been successful or given up on Linux altogether in all probability!\n", "Q: Can't make, says Kernel source is missing I'm trying to follow the instructions here \nhttp://wiki.freepbx.org/display/FOP/Installing+FreePBX+13+on+Ubuntu+Server+14.04.2+LTS \nto install FreePBX/Asterisk on my Ubuntu server.

Permissions on file/dirs mounted via NFS are controlled by how your UID maps into the NFS server's UID space (and what groups you have on the NFS server), and how the NFS volume is mounted.  \nDo  \nmount | egrep '[[:blank:]]/srv'  \n\nto see how it's mounted.   \n", "Q: Does chown always require sudo?

You don't need sudo to change the group to a group you already belong to. Note that this is specified in the POSIX standard.\n\nA: File permissions are stored in the parent directory.

It seems there's a small but real risk that if you get the PID of a process and don't kill it immediately then that process could terminate and the PID be more or less immediately recycled, and you could therefore end up killing the wrong process.  I'm not aware of any rule that says the the OS definitely won't reuse a PID within n seconds. Isn't this a risk?  \n\nA: The PID assigment occurs by an incremental counter (+1) starting at 0 and usually wrapping at around 60000-65000. You won't have to worry about accidentally killing a process which is already assigned the previous PID, it would take a considerate amount of time before the system reuses it. \n", "Q: I am not able to change directory to local disk using terminal even though ls is listing them It is showing directory doesn't exist again and again\nhere is what I am getting \nv4_adi@v4:/media/v4_adi$ ls\nF drive  Local Disk1\nv4_adi@v4:/media/v4_adi$ cd F Drive\nbash: cd: F: No such file or directory\nv4_adi@v4:/media/v4_adi$ \n\n\nA: Do it this way\ncd \"F drive\"\n\nor\ncd F\\ drive\n\nThe space in the directory name should be quoted or escaped.

However you can boot from any format as long as your bootloader recognizes it. \nIf you are going to use unetbootin then I would recommend using a FAT32 format. \nYou can also copy a CD image directly to flash drive and make it bootable using dd\ndd if=path/to/isofile.iso of=/dev/sdd\n\nReplace /dev/sdd with your flash drive which you can find by,\nsudo fdisk -l\n\n\nA: OK, sorry for reply only with the link. \nI edited my answer: \nIt is due to the grub loader of the LiveUSB, bootx64.efi not load ext4 module.

I'd like to rename all files which, when unzipped, contain a file of the form\nYYYYMMDD_IPC.csv\n\nwhere YYYYMMDD happens to be a date but for the purposes of this problem is any string of exactly 8 digits. Then, the zip file itself should be renamed to\nYYYYMMDD_IPC.zip.\n\nI have gotten as far as the following command line but I don't know how to capture the YYYYMMDD from the contained file to use in order to rename the zip files:\nfind . -iname '*.zip' | while read file; do unzip -l \"$file\" | grep -q -P '\\d{8}_IPC.csv' && echo $file; done 2>&- \n\nThank you for reading. \n\nA: find . -iname '*.zip' -exec bash -c 'name=$(unzip -qql \"$1\"  '*_IPC.csv' | grep -oE '[[:digit:]]{8}_IPC.csv' | head -n1); [ \"$name\" ] && mv \"$1\" \"${name%csv}zip\"' none {} ';'\n\nHow it works\nThis  command has the form:\nfind . -iname '*.zip' -exec bash -c '...' none {} ';'\n\nThis searches for .zip file in the current directory and all subdirectories under it.  For each such file found the bash command in single quotes is executed.  The name of the file found is supplied at argument one, $1, to the bash command.  In our case, the bash command has two parts.  The first extracts the csv file name and saves it in bash variable name:\nname=$(unzip -qql \"$1\"  '*_IPC.csv' | grep -oE '[[:digit:]]{8}_IPC.csv' | head -n1)\n\nThe above uses command substitution: the command inside $(...) is run and its standard out is captured.  In this case, we assign it to the variable name.  The command unzip -qql \"$1\"  '*_IPC.csv' quietly extracts all file names from the zip file that match the glob *_IPC.csv.  We don't need to limit to the glob *_IPC.csv but, if the zip file has many files in it, this may speed things up.\nThe grep command, rep -oE '[[:digit:]]{8}_IPC.csv' further selects only those name that start with 8 digits.  The head -n1 command selects the first such name found.  If there was only one such name, head -n1 wouldn't be needed.  But, keeping head could speed things up because it causes the pipeline to terminate after the first match.\nThe second part tests that we succeeded in getting a non-empty name and, if so, renames the zip file:\n[ \"$name\" ] && mv \"$1\" \"${name%csv}zip\"\n\nThe above uses suffix removal to change the csv file name to a zip file name.  ${name%csv} returns $name after having removed the suffix csv.  ${name%csv}zip adds a zip suffix.\n", "Q: When Running 64-bit File on 64-bit Lubuntu Receive message: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error I am running Lubuntu 15.04 64-bit, and want to learn to code with SFML.

I have an extra SSD which I had previously installed Ubuntu on for fun and after years of little use decided to switch back to windows to use as a OS only hard drive after my main windows HD has become slow. I also have 2 internal hard drives, one with windows installed and one used for storage. I have run into some issues that may be my own fault regarding the new windows install on the SSD.

You may be able to re-use the disk by writing a fresh image to the disk using dd, or possibly some other tool. If you want to use the disk for other purposes, or if the tool you use balks, you must completely wipe the partition table. One relatively easy way to do this is with sgdisk:\nsudo sgdisk -Z /dev/sdc\n\nBe careful with that command! A slip-up could seriously damage your hard disk! Pay particular attention to the disk device (/dev/sdc in this example).\nThis example wipes the GUID Partition Table (GPT) on /dev/sdc. Change /dev/sdc to the appropriate device. (Since MBR's critical data structures occupy a subset of the space consumed by GPT, the MBR data will also be wiped by this command.)\nNote that /dev/sdb1 in your example is not a disk device; it's a partition. Whole-disk device names in Linux usually take the form /dev/sdx, where x is a letter. Adding a number, as in /dev/sdb1, means the reference is to a partition.\nWiping the first 20MiB of the disk, as in user413594's answer, will probably do the trick; but that both wipes much more data than necessary and does not wipe the backup partition table, if the disk uses (or ever used) GPT. This failure to wipe the backup GPT data could cause confusion down the road, should any disk utility look for and find this old data.\nAfter you wipe the old partition table, you can use any tool you like (gdisk, parted, fdisk, GParted, etc.) to create a new partition table. Depending on the tool you use, you might then need to use mkfs or a related tool to create a new filesystem on the partition you create.\n\nA: For these kind of operations, use wipefs.\nhttps://manpages.courier-mta.org/htmlman8/wipefs.8.html\n\nwipefs can erase filesystem, raid or partition-table signatures (magic strings) from the specified device to make the signatures invisible for libblkid. wipefs does not erase the filesystem itself nor any other data from the device.\n\nwipefs -a /dev/sdX\n\n", "Q: Can I play games off a sd card? So I have ubuntu 14.04 running xfce4. I was planning on getting a 64 gb sd card to play games on it. I have a Dell chromebook. I just wanted to know if it was possible to download games such as league of legends, rocket league, cs go on the sd and play it on the chromebook. I already have minecraft running on the system's memory. If that was possible, can you please explain how to do it in a step by step process or send me a link to a video? Thanks for the help.\n\nA: I advise you to not try to do this. SD cards are notoriously slow (although experiences vary), with a max of 312 MB/s for the highest class. Compare this to the max of 6 Gb/s for a hard drive.\nAt the very least, you will need to have a Class 10 or UHS-1 SD card, which are not cheap. The SD from your phone won't cut it.\nAdd this to the fact that Chromebooks are very well known to be lacking in performance, I'd be surprised if your games will even be able to run.\n\nWith that in mind, take this advice with a grain of salt.\n\n\n*\n\n*Begin by inserting your SD card and making a note of where it mounts.\n\n*Download PlayOnLinux and symlink your wineprefix to your SD card.\n\n*Use PlayOnLinux as you normally would. Games should automatically install to the SD card.\n\n", "Q: Backing up system to USB drive I intend to back up my Ubuntu system to a USB stick before attempting to dual boot it with Windows 7.

What directories should I back up in order to achieve this?\n\n*Is it possible to restore a backup image of Ubuntu after installing Windows 7 and maintain all my data and packages?\n\n*I also plan to later update Windows 7 to Windows 10.

What you must do is disable client-to-client in the server configuration file, but you also must configure OpenVPN in a way where every client is on their own /30 subnet, rather than having every client in the same /24 (or whatever) subnet.\nSo to answer your question, it is NOT possible to prevent client to client communication if they are on the same subnet using OpenVPN's server/client configuration alone.\nWith that said, of course you could use iptables to block specific traffic per host, however this would be quite cumbersome not only to configure, but also to scale.  Therefore, your best option would be to configure /30 subnets for each client.\n\nA: Yes. As mentioned in the manpage:\n   --client-to-client\n          Because the OpenVPN server mode handles multiple clients  through\n          a  single  tun or tap interface, it is effectively a router.

So I switch to TTY (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and created a new user and found out that I can login using the new user. Then I realize that if I use the new user's $HOME/.profile, I can login too.

Which is nice!\nBut.. Why doesn't it use my already deployed machines or the machines with status ready? \nAnd how can I connect one of these \"new\" juju machines with my MaaS Machines?\nThe 4 new machines is only visible in the juju-gui and not in juju status nor MaaS. I simply don't know how to \"feed\" it with the necessary machines without moving services and deploying everything manually.\n\nA: \n\"Why doesn't it use my already deployed machine...?\"\n\nIf something is previously deployed then Juju won't necessarily re-use it since the default is often one-service-per-node (installing to the \"root\" container, if you will).  You can, though, install into LXC containers and co-locate services on the same node which is likely what that bundle is doing.\n\n\"Why doesn't it use my other nodes with Ready status...?\"\n\nThe scheduler will select four nodes which have the correct architecture (Trusty, for example) and if the bundle has memory and/or processor requirements this also might filter which nodes it uses.\nYou might give all this some time.  Typically, it seems to go fast at first and will show up visually in the juju-gui console and still it's grinding away if you're watching \"juju status\" or \"juju debug-log\" to see what's going on.\nAfter you have the stack up and running and juju status reports that everything is running (versus \"pending\" or \"allocating\" or whatever) then you're expected to add some nova-compute nodes, say, with a \"juju add-unit nova-compute\" perhaps.\nIn order to ssh into some of these nodes you'll want to make sure that you go into the MAAS console and add a keypair for this.  Then from your controller, perhaps, you would do \"ssh ubuntu@nodename.domain\" and credential using the shared secret from the keypair generation.  Once you're in that session with the node you could visit the /var/log/maas and /var/log/juju folders and review the logs there--they usually have the best insight into how your deployment went.\nSo the commissioning logs are basically the pre-charms stuff related to MAAS itself and not necessarily useful at this step.  They're the ones with /var/logs/maas/cloud.log in their file naming.  The deployment logs are more of what you should be after at this step.  They'll be the ones in the /var/log/juju folder like \"unit-CHARMNAME-0.log\" and these you can watch in realtime while the deployment is happening.\nOne big annonyance is that your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file will need to be managed as you deploy/delete/re-deploy the same nodes since they'll get new IP addresses.  To ssh this looks like a security problem.  You'll need to manually run pairs of commands like:\nssh-keygen -R nodename.domain\nssh-keygen -R 192.168.0.22\n\n...when that \"nodename\" node has been re-deployed.\n", "Q: amount of attempts Authentication password Is there an amount of attempts when I forget the authentication password?\nLike Iphone or something when after 3 times the phone is locked for 30 sec, and after that for 5 minutes (and so on..)?\nI have some optional passwords to try but I don't want to disable the computer.\n\nA: No, you will not be locked out if you have started a certain number of incorrect attempts. At least not in the default installation.\nBut it is possible, via PAM. ;)\n", "Q: Is there a way to run a bash script unattended? I'm still pretty new to the Linux world now that I've completely the made the switch because of my experiences with Windows 10.  I gave it a shot, but it's just not as good as I would have expected due to all the hype around it. Anyway I would gauge my knowledge of Linux so far I'd say that I'm a little past KUbuntu as a \"n00b\" and \"beginner\". I'm not certain if this can be done, so I hope someone will let me know if this is possible or not.\nI have already learned the apt-get install -y Foo trick to install whatever I'm trying to without the terminal asking me to hit Y or N.\nSo here's my question.  I have found many \"post install\" scripts for every flavor of Ubuntu as well as many for other distros like Elementary, Manjaro, SuSe, and so on. They have been made so others can install many pieces of software, tweaks, themes, etc.\nIs it possible to tell my new Kubuntu 15.04 system to always hit Y when prompted to accept the new features?  Is there a way to do this with a bash script? Or do I have to watch it like a hawk so it does not keep aborting if I'm late getting to the computer to hit Y?\n\nA: Yes, there is. There's the yes command whose job is precisely that. It will repeatedly output a given string (y is the default). So, if the sciprt foo.sh expects you to hit y to confirm an action, you can run it this way:\nyes | foo.sh\n\nHowever, this is really not a good idea. First of all, in most cases, there is no timeout. You don't need to rush to the computer, it will wait for you. Computers tend to be quite patient beasts. More importantly, you rarely want to just blindly accept anything you are told to. It is a good idea to make up your own mind and that's why you're being asked. \nIn any case, the choice is yours. If you are sure you want to blindly answer \"yes\" to all questions, just use yes. \n\nA: You could create a copy of the script and run sed -i 's|apt-get install|apt-get -y --force-yes install|g' /path/to/script, which would replace every occurrence of apt-get install with an automatically answered version. Be careful about the --force-yes, though.\nAlso this probably won't really solve your problem, because in most scripts Y/N questions are not \"asked\" by apt, but \"by the script itself\", usually with the read command.\nYou could try to run /path/to/script -h or /path/to/script --help to see if there is an auto-accept switch.\nAnother method would be to pass the \"Y\" via pipe, i.e. for i in {1..10}; do echo Y; done |/path/to/script, but that's a rather unclean method.\n\nA: *\n\n*AFAIK, Y always is not good and more specifically with apt-get dist-upgrade. Actually, it is easy to answer Y for the 1st question before start downloading.\n\n*The other ones are mainly from post install script, try this:\nsudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install Foo\n\nSource: How do I ask apt-get to skip any interactive post-install configuration steps?\n", "Q: drives mount after switch to windows and get back to ubuntu I installed Ubuntu 14.04 beside Windows 8\nWhen I boot Ubuntu windows NTFS drives don't open and show this:\n\nError mounting /dev/sda5/ at /media/username/Ali : command-line mount\n  -t \"ntfs\" -o\n\n\nBut after restarting and booting windows and then get back to ubuntu I can access drives.\nWhat to do drives mount without booting windows?\n\nA: Your problem probably is the Windows fast startup option. You have to disable it.\nBoot Windows, open Control Panel, type \"change what power buttons do\" and select the link \"Change what the power buttons do\".\nSelect the link \"Change settings that are currently unavailable\", scroll down and uncheck \"Turn on fast start-up (recommended)\".\nRestart the computer and you won't have this error anymore.\nSee here for more informations about Windows Fast Boot.\n\nA: Besides the instructions already given by @hg8, you should and have to disable hibernation.  \nTo accomplish this, boot Windows and open command prompt as administrator and execute :  \npowercfg /h off  \n\nShutdown the machine (not reboot) completely. Then start your computer and boot into ubuntu.  \nSo with Fast Boot turned off and hibernation disabled you will be able to mount NTFS partitions.\n", "Q: GParted does not show free space partitioned with Windows This is my third failed attempt at dual booting windows 8.1 and Ubuntu (14.04 twice, and now 15.04). My computer is a Gigabyte Aorus X3 plus V3. When I tried to install Ubuntu using the 'something else' option (as it does not detect windows 8.1) it showed me that I had only 1Mb of free space, even though I had shrunk the windows partition by roughly 250Gb.

What do I do now? How do I create space for Ubuntu without using windows partition editing tools?\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot from Ubuntu install media.\n\n*Select Try Ubuntu without installing.\n\n*Open GParted (Partitioning tool).\n\n*Reduce the Windows partition.  \n\n*Create a partition for Ubuntu (size that fits your needs).\n\n*Create a swap partition (size minimum matching RAM).\n\n*On the desktop click Install Ubuntu.\n\n*Choose Something else.  \n\n*Select the partition you created for Ubuntu before.\n\n", "Q: Gnome 3.14 not showing tray Hy there!\nI just made a fresh install of Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 on a Dell Latitude E5450.

Is there anything I am missing?\nCheers\n\nA: This will be by default in a bar at the bottom in 3.14 (and older versions) - you can access it by pushing the mouse at the bottom of the screen (or pressing Super+M or something), like the grey bit at the bottom of this screenshot - this also will contain notifications you get:\n\nHowever, similar to the screenshot, you can move the status icons of Skype, Dropbox etc to the top bar by use of GNOME shell extensions - e.g.:\n\n*\n\n*Topicons\n\n*TopTray (similar but you should be able to re-size the icons)\n\nN.B with 3.16 (unavailable by default on your Ubuntu version), it has been changed so by default the the notification appear in the calendar menu, and the status icons appear in the bottom left - see here\n\nA: I have to write an answer, too =)\nUpdate your GNOME to version 3.16 as describes here. \nWith this version you have a small floating window in the lower right corner, which you can show if necessary.

Is it possible doing such a thing?\n\nA: *\n\n*I  have teamviewer 10 as a quick support version on my host machine.\nTeamviewer log file : ~/Desktop/TeamViewer/teamviewerqs/logfiles/TeamViewer10_Logfile.log\n\n\n*For full version: ~/.config/teamviewer10/logfiles/TeamViewer10_Logfile.log\nSo to detect the session you can watch this file using tail -f and the pattern  *\"==== .Open Desktop! ====\". And once pattern is found , killing the required process after say 60 secs.\ntail -f \"$HOME/Desktop/TeamViewer/teamviewerqs/logfiles/TeamViewer10_Logfile.log\" \\\n | awk '/==== .*Open Desktop! ====/ { system(\"sleep 60 ; pkill -9 TeamViewer_Desktop\") }'\n\n\nA: I couldn't find any command line tool to check the current sessions. Also TeamViewer does not create new process for each new session.\nI end up checking the created sockets directly using a modified script written by cYrus by from How to determine the socket connection up time on Linux\nThe script checks for established connections by teamviewerd daemon. It depends on the configuration but default, it tries port 5938 if it fails it tries 443 and may be 80. Then it prints out the life/up time in minutes of all sockets.\nteamviewerd creates one connection when desktop application launched then another new one for session (I couldn't test multiple sessions)\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction suptime() {\n    addr=${1:?Specify the remote IPv4 address}\n    port=${2:?Specify the remote port number}\n    pid=$(netstat -ntp 2>/dev/null | awk '\n$6 == \"ESTABLISHED\" && $5 == \"'$addr:$port'\"\\\n{sub(\"/.*\", \"\", $7); print $7}')\n    hex_addr=$(python -c \"\nimport socket, struct;\nprint hex(struct.unpack('<L',\nsocket.inet_aton('$addr'))[0])[2:10].upper().zfill(8)\")\n    hex_port=$(python -c \"print hex($port)[2:].upper().zfill(4)\")\n    inode=$(awk '$3 == \"'$hex_addr:$hex_port'\" {print $10}' /proc/net/tcp)\n    time=$(find /proc/$pid/fd -lname \"socket:\\[$inode\\]\" -printf %A@)\n    LANG=C printf '%i' $(bc <<<\"($(date +%s.%N) - $time)/60\")\n}\n\nns=$(netstat -tpn | grep -e \":5938 *ESTABLISHED *[0-9]*/teamviewerd\" -e \":443 *ESTABLISHED *[0-9]*/teamviewerd\" | awk '{print $5}')\n\nfor s in $ns\ndo\n\n    addr=$(echo $s | awk '{split($0,a,\":\"); print a[1]};')\n    port=$(echo $s | awk '{split($0,a,\":\"); print a[2]};')\n\n    echo $(suptime $addr $port)\ndone\n\nOther possible options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check log for connections like Amit did in his answer.\n\n*Use xdotool or similar tool, to open side panel them close session.\n\n\nA: As of TeamViewer 12 and Ubuntu 16.04, a new process\n/opt/teamviewer/tv_bin/TeamViever_Desktop --IPCport 5936 --module 1\n\nis spawned with the start of the session. This can be easily monitored.\n(I know this is an old question, but someone might find the update useful)\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu 64-bit support my PC with of 2 gb ram? Can I install Ubuntu 64-bit onto my PC?\nHere are my specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*2 gb ram\n\n*x64 processor\n\n*3.2 ghz \n\n\nA: In theory you probably can, but it is not recommended to install 64bit Ubuntu (or other OS) on systems with significantly less than at least 4GB of RAM.\nThe reason is that a 64bit system stores all data in RAM as chunks of at least 64 bits wide, which is 8 bytes. This also applies if the data chunk would just need e.g. 1 or 8 bits to be saved.\nOn a 32bit system, all data in memory is split up into clusters of 32 bits width, which is 4 bytes. Therefore, as many applications mostly use data types with not more than 32 bits width, a 64bit system may need up to twice as much RAM as a 32bit system. Because of this, there is the 4GB rule of thumb.\nThe 64bit version may be slightly faster because of better processor usage, but it may also be slower because it runs oftener and more quickly out of RAM.\nThis thread provides more explanations about 32bit vs. 64bit.\nTherefore my recommendation:\nInstall Ubuntu (version 14.04 LTS or 15.04) in 32bit architecture or upgrade your RAM.\nIn case you still get bad performance, maybe you should even consider choosing a more lightweight desktop environment like XFCE instead of Unity. Xubuntu comes with XFCE desktop by default.\n\nA: Short and simple answer: Yes you can!  \n64-bit has a better CPU performance but 32-bit uses less RAM.  \nSo it really depends what people do with their machines to decide which one is better.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04 fails to resume from hibernation Not a crucial issue, it's just annoying when it happens. My computer has a great chance to fail in resuming from hibernation.\nWhen it happens, the console prints the following info and then hangs:\n\n[timestamps] PM: Using 3 thread(s) for decompression.\n  [timestamps] PM: Loading and decompressing image data\n  [timestamps] PM: Image Loading progress: ??%\n  [timestamps] Switched to clocksource tsc\n  [timestamps] random: nonblocking pool is initialized\n  [timestamps] PM: Image loading done.\n  [timestamps] serial 00:05: disabled\n  [timestamps] PM: quiesce of devices complete after 0.387 msec\n  [timestamps] PM: late quiesce of devices complete after 0.140 msec\n  [timestamps] PM: noirq quiesce of devices complete after 0.307 msec\n  [timestamps] Disable non-boot CPUs...\n  [timestamps] Intel_pstate CPU1 exiting\n  [timestamps] smpboot: CPU1 is now offline\n  [timestamps] Disable non-boot CPUs...\n  [timestamps] Intel_pstate CPU2 exiting\n  [timestamps] smpboot: CPU2 is now offline\n  [timestamps] Disable non-boot CPUs...\n  [timestamps] Intel_pstate CPU3 exiting\n  [timestamps] smpboot: CPU3 is now offline  \n\nMy OS is Xubuntu 14.04.3, kernel version is 3.19.0-28-generic if that matters.\nMy PC specs: i3 4170, Gigabyte B85M-D3V-A, G.Skill 8G ram and Nvidia GT 630 with nvidia 352 driver installed.\n\nA: This might be a kernel bug. I have this problem with kernel 3.19 and Ubuntu mainline kernel v4.2.3. Downgrading to 3.16 apparently solves the problem.\n\nA: Unfortunately, hibernate doesn't work in many cases, which can cause you to lose data if you expect your documents and applications to re-open when you switch your computer back on. Therefore, hibernate is disabled by default.\nYou can find more information about how to fix your problem at Ubuntu Wiki - Debugging Kernel Hibernate.\n\nA: The same bug on ASUS K401L with Ubuntu 14.04.3 running on kernel 3.19.0 and 4.1.13. There is a 1/3 probability of resume failure. \nIf the resume failed, system will hang with the console output below\nDisabling non-boot CPUs...\nintel_pstate CPU 1 exiting\nsmpboot: CPU 1 is now offline\nintel_pstate CPU 2 exiting\nsmpboot: CPU 2 is now offline\nintel_pstate CPU 3 exiting\nsmpboot: CPU 3 is now offline\n\nJust downgraded to 3.16, it seems work well, but may need further tests.\n", "Q: How can i install things in my second hard drive?

The 1 stands for the first partition on the disc. ext4, when you choose it as your format in GParted.)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*When you reboot your system again now, the second hard disc is supposed to be mounted automatically.\n\n\nMoving Programs\n\n\n*\n\n*An easy way to move programs onto the second hard disc is creating symlinks:\n\n\n\nWith a symlink you move the actual file to another place and you on the former place create a symlink which directs to the new place - explained in easy words. I recommend, that before you move files you make a copy of them with an alternative name and delete them first, when everything is working.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now search for the programs/files you want to have on your second disc, it's likely that they are stored under  /usr/bin, /usr/sbin or /binⁱ.\n\n*Make a backup of them in the same directory\nsudo cp <PATHtoFILE>/<filename> <PATHtoFILE>/<filename>_backup #it doesnt matter how you name your copy.\n\n\n*Then copy your file on the second hard disc:\nsudo cp <PATHtoFILE>/<filename> /media/<user>/<nameOfyourDrive>/<filename> # the mountpoint you created earlier, your second hard disc\n\n\n*And now you are able to create a symlink to its former place:\nsudo ln -s /media/<user>/<nameOfyourDrive>/<filename> <oldPath>/<filename> #creates a symbolic link from the old path to the second hard drive\n\n\nTest the programs or files, which you intend to move: If you recognize, that everything is working nicely, you can delete the backup, which you hopefully created earlier:\n\n sudo rm [-r] <PATHtoFILE>/<filename>_backup # removes backup-file or directory: '-r' only, when it's a directory\n\n\nⁱ Matter, that it's not sure that all parts of the programs are here. It may be possible, that they are in different directiers or separated into more than only one. Furthermore it's likely that they access libraries from /usr/lib/or from elsewhere in the filesystem.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 freezes when shutting down I´m having an issue with my laptop shutting down - after installing Ubuntu 15.04 when I press shut down after going into the shut-down screen it freezes, and I have to press the power switch off the laptop.

XScreenSaver has lots of problems, many Linux distributions have dropped it from their default installation for this reason.\nSo, this is not a problem on the side of Firefox.\n\nI am adding some more background info. This what the official FAQ says:\n\nHow do I prevent xscreensaver from blanking the screen when I'm watching movies on my computer?\nIf you are using mpv or mplayer, put this in your ~/.mplayer/config file:\nheartbeat-cmd=\"xscreensaver-command -deactivate >&- 2>&- &\"\nIf you're using something else:\nWhen you want to watch a movie, fire up xscreensaver-demo and select Mode: Disable Screen Saver from the option menu, which means not to blank the screen at all. When you're done watching the movie, re-select your previous mode.\nThat's kind of lame, I know.

I'm new to Ubuntu, running 14.04 and I realize how could I get some more speed with 2GB of RAM. \nIf someone could bring some fine tuning advices just to speed things up a quite bit would be great.\n\nA: Unity is the name of the default Ubuntu Desktop, known by its vertical buttons on the left etc.\nIt is possible to replace this desktop, but if you are really new, it might be easier to just reinstall a different Ubuntu flavor such as Xubuntu or Lubuntu.\nAlso consider the Ubuntu derivative Linux Mint, installing Linux Mint from scratch might be the easiest path, it is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with a different desktop (called Cinnamon).\nThese other desktops tend to look more like a classic windows desktop, But Unity and Gnome3 do things differently, more \"tablet\" oriented.\nBut you can still test desktops in your current install, by installing a package name with -desktop at the end. From the Software Center, you search say, lubuntu-desktop, install that and then log out; before logging back in there is an option to change the desktop to Lubuntu (LXDE).\nThe disadvantage of this is that you end with redundant packages from both desktops taking more space and memory, as opposed to having a fresh Lubuntu install from its own iso.\nAlso if you will never have more than 2gb of ram in that computer, stick to 32bit edition, is needs less ram than 64bit.\n", "Q: Download subtitles with nautilus How to add \"download subtitles\" option (for example with Qnapi app) to nautilus context menu ?

Is there a possibility to deny users from creating directories in a given directory? \n\nA: Yes, it is possible. You need to revoke write permissions for the directory. It can be done by\nchmod -w /path/to/dir\n\nThe user will not be able to create files or directories in the directory.\nBut I do not see a simple way to allow users to create files and do not allow to create directories.\nThere can be a workaround with a script using inotify that will detect creation of directories and doing something, like removing them, etc.\nAnother option is to revoke permissions from mkdir. In this case the user will not be able to create any directories.\nAnd also there is another very hacky way\n\nA: In Linux everything is a file. If you prevent the creation of directories, you also prevent the creation of normal files. And you definitely do not want that, as I gather from your comment.\n\nA: Just remove write permissions on that directory for groups.

However, I bought a Toshiba L50-C-12V last month and I need to know if it will work with my hardware fully or if I will at least be able to get ubuntu compatible drivers for my hardware.

The Link below will take you to the specifications for the exact make and model of my laptop. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\nLaptop Specs \n\nA: I checked your specs, and in my opinion all modern linux distros will support them, ubuntu included. Most hardware setups dont need proprietary drivers in linux unlike windows, so yea as Rinzwind also said i would suggest you to try ubuntu.

It has Linux Mint, Cinnamon, on it. Mint is a fork of Ubuntu and shares the same repositories. It works just fine so it will probably work with Ubuntu as well. \nIn fact, I did have Ubuntu on it for a short spell. I broke the OS and did not take the time to fix it. That is how I ended up with Mint on it but, importantly, the breakage was due to my own error and the OS was fine otherwise for the short time that it was installed.\nI needed no special configuration nor did I need to install the proprietary drivers (IIRC) to get it working.

Both of these curl and wget are use for downloading files, etc. What are the notable differences one might take in account in order chose one over the other?\n\nA: They have much functionality in common, but curl has more options. For wget it may occasionally be sufficient to leaf through man wget, but for curl I need to study this webpage in a browser. I believe anything your browser can do, curl can do as well. \n\nA: There's another difference between wget and curl which I think is significant. \nWget is a stand-alone command line utility that's intended primarily for retrieving internet content quickly and simply. \nCurl on the other hand is basically a terminal front end for the powerful libcurl library. Libcurl provides a very powerful set of tools for working with URLs in all their forms and flavors, and is available for almost all languages and platforms. Curl basically gives you the ability to use this library in shell scripts. \n\nA: After you've defined \"proper use\", use wget.\nWhy? That's why:\nRecursive! wget's major strong side compared to curl is its ability to download recursively, or even just download everything that is referred to from a remote resource, be it a HTML page or a FTP directory listing.\n\nShameless copied from here\ncurl\n\n\n*\n\n*library. curl is powered by libcurl – a cross-platform library with a stable API that can be used by each and everyone. This difference is major since it creates a completely different attitude on how to do things internally. It is also slightly harder to make a library than a \"mere\" command line tool.\n\n*pipes. curl works more like the traditional Unix cat command, it sends more stuff to stdout, and reads more from stdin in a \"everything is a pipe\" manner. wget is more like cp, using the same analogue.\n\n*Single shot. curl is basically made to do single-shot transfers of data. It transfers just the URLs that the user specifies, and does not contain any recursive downloading logic nor any sort of HTML parser.\n\n*More protocols. curl supports FTP, FTPS, Gopher, HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, TELNET, DICT, LDAP, LDAPS, FILE, POP3, IMAP, SMB/CIFS, SMTP, RTMP and RTSP. Wget only supports HTTP, HTTPS and FTP.\n\n*More portable. curl builds and runs on lots of more platforms than wget. For example: OS/400, TPF and other more \"exotic\" platforms that aren't straight-forward Unix clones.\n\n*More SSL libraries and SSL support. curl can be built with one out of eleven (11!) different SSL/TLS libraries, and it offers more control and wider support for protocol details. curl supports public key pinning.\n\n*HTTP auth. curl supports more HTTP authentication methods, especially over HTTP proxies: Basic, Digest, NTLM and Negotiate\n\n*SOCKS. curl supports several SOCKS protocol versions for proxy access\n\n*Bidirectional. curl offers upload and sending capabilities. wget only offers plain HTTP POST support.\n\n*HTTP multipart/form-data sending, which allows users to do HTTP \"upload\" and in general emulate browsers and do HTTP automation to a wider extent\n\n*curl supports gzip and inflate Content-Encoding and does automatic decompression\n\n*curl offers and performs decompression of Transfer-Encoded HTTP, wget doesn't\n\n*curl supports HTTP/2 and it does dual-stack connects using Happy Eyeballs\n\n*Much more developer activity. While this can be debated, I consider three metrics here: mailing list activity, source code commit frequency and release frequency. Anyone following these two projects can see that the curl project has a lot higher pace in all these areas, and it has been so for 10+ years. Compare on openhub\n\nwget\n\n\n*\n\n*wget is command line only. There's no library.\n\n*Recursive! wget's major strong side compared to curl is its ability to download recursively, or even just download everything that is referred to from a remote resource, be it a HTML page or a FTP directory listing.\n\n*Older. wget has traces back to 1995, while curl can be tracked back no earlier than the end of 1996.\n\n*GPL. wget is 100% GPL v3. curl is MIT licensed.\n\n*GNU. wget is part of the GNU project and all copyrights are assigned to FSF. The curl project is entirely stand-alone and independent with no organization parenting at all with almost all copyrights owned by Daniel.\n\n*wget requires no extra options to simply download a remote URL to a local file, while curl requires -o or -O.\n\n*wget supports the Public Suffix List for handling cookie domains, curl does not.\n\n*wget supports only GnuTLS or OpenSSL for SSL/TLS support\n\n*wget supports only Basic auth as the only auth type over HTTP proxy\n\n*wget has no SOCKS support\n\n*Its ability to recover from a prematurely broken transfer and continue downloading has no counterpart in curl.\n\n*wget can be typed in using only the left hand on a qwerty keyboard!\n\nA: There are many tools that can download like curl ,snarf , wget, pavuk, fget, fetch, lftp ,aria2 ,

When I'm trying to dual boot Ubuntu 15.04 and Windows 8.1 and I get to creating partitions for Ubuntu in gparted, I see tons of partitions which I have no idea what they are. On windows partition editor I can only see four and I recognize them all. I don't even see my windows partition on gparted. Is this normal?\nGparted also comes up with errors as 'invalid argument during seek for read on /dev/sda' 'the backup GPT table is corrupt but the primary appears to be ok so that will be used'\nThese are links to screenshots of each partition table:\n\nHttp:''imgur.com/t8E6whs\n\nA: Using this image as reference, under the Device column (top to bottom):\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda - the name of the actual drive \n\n*/dev/sda1, /dev/sda2,...,/dev/sda7 - are all partitions on said drive\n\n\nIf you look at the Type column, you can see the partition formats:\n\n\n*\n\n*ntfs for /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 probably mean they are windows partitions\n\n*ext4 for /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda7 these are linux partitions\n\n*swap for /dev/sda6 is linux swap (as indicated by the chart at the upper part of the picture)\n\n\nFor extra safety, you can use windows disk manager to 'empty' the area on the disk you want ubuntu to use. that way when you boot up ubuntu it will show up as 'allocated disk space' (usually marked in grey on gparted), then let the installer use that area on the disk.\nI've done this many times over the past 7 years. but not since I got my current laptop (over a year ago). at the time I found the older version of this guide to be very helpful.\n", "Q: Can't fully mount or clone Windows 8.1 hard disk sda2 is missing Yes I have read at least other 7 articles with similar problems and tried those solutions. But I don't think there is a question like this one.\nWindows was failing on a HP pavilion laptop, so I ran all the Windows and HP diagnostics and repair tools available, and most failed. Then I moved to Ubunuto so I could make a data backup and try to do a factory reset (I think that's gonna fail too).\nSo Windows says it only has two partitions, the small one for the system and the primary one where everything is installed. It doesn't show a hidden HP restore partition.\nClonezilla shows 6 partitions sda1 thru sda6. Being the 450GB primary windows partition sd4. Neither Ubuntu, Windows HP diag tools, nor Clonezilla could mount Windows partition sd4. \nThe common problem is that Windows 8.1 did not shut down correctly... because it was failing and does not boot any more (cause I tried all Win repairs too, I know it won't). Therefore I cannot enter Windows and shut it down correctly.\nWith clonezilla I erased the \"Dirty Bit\" flag on two partitions (wow, not just sda4, and don't know what other, maybe sda2). so the program could be used on those partitions too, since it said it couldn't do it without it being removed.\nSo it backed up sda1 (500MB system) sda2 (don0t know) sda3(dont know) and sda6(hidden restore partition) but not sda4(450GB partition with all my data). Don't know why it couldn't do it with sda5 or what it is.\nFinal message of clonezilla is \"Broken partition images were found or some of them are not checkable in this iamge: nameofthefile\".\nSo, I just want to mount Windows partition (sda4 in clonezilla, sda2 in ubuntu but not detected by it), recover my files and erase the whole thing. ¿Ideas?

I am somewhat of a noob with Linux and I've found solutions that led to some screen tearing option found within the Catalyst panel, but it doesn't exist in the version 15.9. It is almost as if extra display options are missing. I found something about that pointing to the rest of the options being present within the display settings, but its not there either. I get screen tearing within Firefox webpages, and VLC, and Netflix within Chrome. I really don't want to go back to Windows, but this tearing thing is killing me. If anyone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. \n\nA: If you have hybrid Intel/AMD graphics, the display options will not be available in the Catalyst Control Center panel (including the \"Tear Free\" option which is available instead for AMD-only driven displays). For what I have understood, this is because with hybrid graphics setups the rendering job can be done by the dedicated (AMD) gpu, but compositing/displaying is always done by the integrated (Intel) gpu. I have a hybrid Intel/AMD configuration (Intel Broadwell/AMD Firepro m4150), I have the same tearing issues as yours when using the AMD gpu for rendering, I have tried Catalyst 15.3 and 15.9 drivers and...nothing. No display options in CCC. I am afraid that you have only two solutions to save your desktop from tearing: 1) using always the integrated gpu (on average intel linux drivers do a quite good job in 2d acceleration, with no tearing at all); 2) move from Catalyst to the Open Source Radeon drivers (however you will probably need to move away also from Unity and use some less \"shiny\" desktop environment, such as Xfce)\n\nA: I looked everywhere online and for me a setting in the radeon control centre (Administrative) helped to solve the issue.\nRadeon Control Centre-> Display Options->Enable Teer Free Despktop to reduce tearing.\nSince then I had no tearning.

There were 2 options to start Windows on the boot screen, the first option just returned me to the boot screen and the second gave the \"Windows is missing something\" screen.\nNo biggie, I reverted back with the system image, read up on some installation guides and tried again. Linux installed correctly and could boot up but again Windows didn't boot. This time on the boot screen if I selected Windows it just went back to the same boot screen. \nI actually took some screenshots with my phone the second time:\n\nAnyway, here's what I am trying to get working; I have two internal hard drives, a normal one for files/games and such, and a SSD, partitioned like this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Windows partition 125GB, \n\n*Linux partition 50GB, \n\n*Linux swap 15GB\n\n*remainder in a 4th partition for programs/games and such\n\n\n2nd HDD, \n\n\n*\n\n*39MB OEM partition (whatever that does, doesn't bother me so I just leave it) - 100gb partition for files, and rest in a 3rd partition for whatever else\n\n\nSo here's what I did with installing Linux the 2nd time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Selected the Windows partition, selected use as NTFS and mount point /windows\n\n*created a 50GB partition for Linux, Ext4 file system and mount point /\n\n*created a 15gb partition for swap drive\n\n*then in the \"device for boot loader installation\" drop down menu I selected the Windows partition\n\n\nLinux boots no problem but when I select to start windows in the boot menu it just goes right back to the boot menu.

These calls time out eventually, but cause the boot of the VirtualBox image to take over 2 minutes.\n\nA: If you really want to use a cloud-image with virtualbox, I'd suggest the .vmdk that Canonical produces instead of the ec2 ami.  It's already set up to use the no-cloud data source and my version of virtualbox already works with a .vmdk natively (or converts transparently, I am not really sure).\nFor detailed instructions, this answer has more.\n\nA: systemctl disable cloud-config.service\nsystemctl disable cloud-final.service \nsystemctl disable cloud-init.service \nsystemctl disable cloud-init-local.service \n\n\nA: For a one-off virtualbox @ching's answer is fine.  However, if you are making a template and you need cloud-init to configure things for you then the \"correct\" way to do this is to create an override file in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/. Files in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/ will override the values in /etc/cloud.cfg.\nExample:\nValue in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg\ndatasource_list: [ Ec2, None ]\n\nNew file /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99_overrides.cfg\ndatasource_list: [ None ]\n\nYou can add other providers here instead of Ec2 - VMware, ConfigDrive, etc which can be really handy for provisioning things like you would with the EC2 metadata.\nSee: https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/datasources.html\n", "Q: apt-get hangs forever during any operation involving apache2 I was trying to update my server (Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS) this morning using:\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get upgrade\n\nThe update went smoothly, but the upgrade hangs forever at:\nSetting up apache2 (2.4.7-1ubuntu4.6) ...\n\nSo after some fruitless googling, I decide to interrupt the  install (ctrl-Z, kill %1) .

Is it possible to keep a public YouTube playlist synced to a local folder as mp3 files? \nKey characteristics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add mp3 file to local folder, if new video is added to the playlist\n\n*Delete mp3 file in local folder, if respective video is removed from the playlist\n\n\nA: You can either use this GitHub repo, which seems to do exactly what you want.\nOr you can use plain youtube-dl with --download-archive, as seen in youtube-dl's man page, although this will not remove any videos:\n\nHow do I download only new videos from a playlist?\nUse download-archive feature. With this feature you should initially download the complete playlist with --download-archive path/to/download/archive/file.txt that will record identifiers of all the videos in a special file.  Each subsequent run with the same --download-archive will download only new videos and skip all videos that have been downloaded before.  Note that only successful downloads are recorded in the file.\nFor example, at first,\nyoutube-dl --download-archive archive.txt \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re\"\nwill download the complete PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re playlist and create a file archive.txt.  Each subsequent run will only download new videos if any:\nyoutube-dl --download-archive archive.txt \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re\"\n\n\nA: This is more of a workaround than a direct answer, but if you are ok with occasionally re-downloading some of the older playlist files you can set up a cronjob to find and delete files in a target directory using find.\nYou should review the playlist and estimate how long files usually stay on it before disappearing, and use that number of days for your variable. Here in my example I chose 30 days.\nHere's an example Bash script for cron to run as an @daily job:\n#! /bin/bash\n\n# Delete all files in a directory older than 30 days\n# (careful, this is recursive and will delete files in subdirectories)\nfind /PATH/TO/youtube-dl-playlist-files -mtime +30 -delete\n\nAny files still on the playlist but older than 30 days will be deleted, and youtube-dl will re-download them when you run it next. This isn't optimal but it may be good enough.\n", "Q: How do I create a shared folder/partition for Windows to access over the network? I am new to Linux. I've built a second computer to start using Ubuntu and hoping to eventually transition into Ubuntu being my primary OS. What I want to right now is have a shared folder that I can use to store data, mainly backup files from my Windows machine like pictures and music, but also be able to access them with Ubuntu. \nI have read extensively that Windows doesn't support Ubuntu's partitions, and that Linux has some issues with NTFS. So I know I did this wrong, but don't know how to do it right.\nWhen installing Ubuntu on my 320GB HD, I created a 70GB partition for root, a 70GB partition for home (both ext4 if I remember right), a 10GB partition for swap, and a 160GB partition as fat32 (didn't know what to do for the mount point so chose /windows).\nNow Ubuntu can find everything, and create folders in that 160GB Windows partition/folder. However I can't share any folders out on that partition, and since its not an ext partition for Ubuntu I can't change ownership or permissions to that partition. \nSo I guess my question is how would I set up that last partition so that I can share out the folder for Windows to access it as well?\n\nA: As I understood, you want to share files from the computer running Ubuntu to other computers running Windows over the network.\nIn this case you do not need to create special partitions for that. That was a bad idea to create a large FAT32 partition.\nI suggest installing Ubuntu a normal way with ext4 partitions for / and /home, and a swap partition.\nThen you will be able to share some folders using samba. In Ubuntu it is very easy. You can right-click any folder in Nautilus and select share.

I've tested the cp command, and it will only copy individual files. For example, I typed cp followed by the exact filename, then typed the directory and the file got copied. However, when I typed the directory and the destination directory, nothing on the computer changed. I thought cp was supposed to copy contents in the directories.\nI've tried this multiple times.\n\nA: Use \ncp -R\n\nIt specifies recursive copy i.e. all sub-directories and files will be copied.\nUse man cp to find more switches for cp.\n\nA: When you use cp without any arguments, it defaults to copying files as below\n cp sourcefile destinationLocation\n #will copy sourcefile to the specified destinationLocation\n\nBut if you want to copy a directory, you need to specify the recursive argument like this\ncp -R dir1 dir2 #copies dir1 to dir2\ncp -R dir dir2 dir3 #copies dir1 & dir2 to dir3\n\nIdeally you can specify as many files as you want to a single destination all separated by spaces. This here below however copies a dir along with its permissions\n sudo cp -rp /home/me /media/backup/me\n -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps\n\nAlternatively you can use rsync\n sudo rsync -a /home/me/ /media/backup/me/\n -a, --archive\n\n          Note that -a does not preserve hardlinks, because finding  multiply-linked\n          files is expensive.  You must separately specify -H.\n\nAnd Please don't forget the trailing slashes when copying using rsync. See the man page for each command on options of using them available on your terminal by typing man cp or man rsync\n\nA: cp does not, by default, copy directories. From man 1posix cp:\n2. If source_file is of type directory, the following steps  shall  be\n   taken:\n\n    a. If  neither the -R or -r options were specified, cp shall write\n       a diagnostic message to standard error, do  nothing  more  with\n       source_file, and go on to any remaining files.\n\nYou should have got a message like so:\ncp: omitting directory '...'\n\nFor example:\n$ cp Documents Pictures\ncp: omitting directory ‘Documents’\n\nAs can be seen from the manpage, use -r or -R with cp:\ncp -R Documents Pictures\n\n", "Q: Can rm -rf use grep?

Please reinstall the kernel module \nby executing\n'/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup'\nas root. If it is available in your distribution, you should install the \nDKMS package first. This package keeps track of Linux kernel changes\nand recompiles the vboxdrv kernel module if necessary.\n\nTo deal with this problem, I first used\nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\nWhen that did not fix VirtualBox, I tried various fixes suggested at this link:\nquestion and answers\nWhat are the adverse consequences for having tried the most popular answer:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms  \nsudo modprobe vboxdrv\n\nand the adverse consequences of having tried this suggestion from a less popular answer:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall virtualbox-dkms\n\nEpilogue: I used Ubuntu Software Centre to uninstall VirtualBox and then I used the instructions from the virtualbox.org to successfully install it. However, I am still interested in the adverse effects of the trial and error activities. Should Ubuntu be reinstalled to clean up the effects of the trial and error activity?\n\nA: There are no adverse effects to action you took and all of them were necessary.\nLet's see them in detail,\n\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nThis command installs linux headers which are a requirement for virtualbox. uname -r portion here give name and version of your os, you could even type it in a terminal to check output yourself.\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms  \n\nThis command reconfigured virtualbox-dkms package. Normally a package gets configure at its install time but since you already had virtualbox-dkms package, you had to use dpkg-reconfigure.\n\nsudo modprobe vboxdrv\n\nThis modprobe command here is used to set kernel modules. Virtualbox requires vboxdrv kernel module, thats why you have to modprobe it. Try man modprobe to find more about it.\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall virtualbox-dkms\n\nThis command simply reinstalled virtualbox-dkms package. This command also has no adverse effect but it makes sudo dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms useless since package virtualbox-dkms will be reinstalled anyway so we dont need to reconfigure it.\nHope that clears it up :).\nAlso On a sidenote do run sudo apt-get autoremove --purge that will remove any left redundant package with it settings.

I have a computer with two 500 GB SSDs, sda and sdb. I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on sda, and there's nothing on sdb. My motherboard has UEFI firmware. I want to install Windows 10 on sdb.\nThere are many answers to the question of how to install Windows after Ubuntu, but they assume the two systems with be on separate partitions on the same disk. They go on to explain that Windows will break Grub and how to go about fixing this.   \nIf I install Windows onto sdb, a completely separate drive, will it still break grub? \nThanks a lot.    \n\nA: Installing Windows doesn't actually break GRUB on an EFI-based installation; it just makes the Windows boot loader the default. In the case of a BIOS-based system, this is done by Windows overwriting GRUB (which could be considered a type of breakage), but in the case of an EFI-based system, this happens by Windows installing its own boot loader next to GRUB and then telling the computer to boot using the Windows boot loader by default. In this second (EFI) case, GRUB remains untouched, and the default boot loader can be changed in any number of ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the EFI firmware's user interface -- Details vary from one EFI to another, and some don't even offer this feature; but some let you permanently change the boot order using the EFI setup utility. Most let you make a temporary change by activating the boot manager's user interface, typically by pressing Esc, Enter, or a function key soon after powering on.\n\n*Using an EFI shell -- The EFI shell program, version 2 (built into a handful of EFIs, and available as a separate binary for others) has a command called bcfg that manipulates boot variables. You can use this tool to change the boot order. See here for more on this subject.\n\n*Using bcdedit in Windows -- Typing bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi in a Windows Administrator Command Prompt window will set Ubuntu as the default. (If Secure Boot is disabled, grubx64.efi can work as well as shimx64.efi, and in a few cases may be required; but shimx64.efi is more likely to work.)\n\n*Using EasyUEFI in Windows -- The third-party EasyUEFI program provides a (relatively) easy-to-use GUI method of manipulating EFI boot entries.\n\n*Using efibootmgr in Linux -- The efibootmgr command can display and change EFI boot entries. You'd type sudo efibootmgr -v to view the current entries, then use -o to change the boot order, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 2,7,4 to boot Boot0002 first, followed by Boot0007 if that fails, and a final attempt at Boot0004.\n\n*Using bless in OS X -- OS X's tool for manipulating EFI boot entries is bless. It's a bit complex, and Macs are a bit weird, so I won't describe it in detail here.\n\n\nNote that on an EFI system, use of one disk vs. two or more disks is largely irrelevant. This is because the EFI boot process involves NVRAM-based pointers to boot loaders. The NVRAM entries include identifiers of the disks and partitions on which the boot loaders are stored. Any partition can hold as many boot loaders as you like (up to some very high theoretical limit); or you can spread them across as many partitions and disks as you like. It's all pretty much the same. One caveat, though: One strategy that's often used in handling BIOS-mode multi-boots is to remove the disk of an already-installed OS while installing a second OS. This can still have a safety benefit on EFI systems, but there is a catch: If you remove a disk, some EFIs will notice that it's gone and remove NVRAM entries for boot loaders stored on that disk. Thus, swapping disks as on a BIOS system can make it harder to boot the second OS, since you'll need to re-create its EFI boot manager entry.\n\nA: As long as you keep all partitions of windows(Both System Reserved and C:) confined to second disk(sdb) it will not break your grub that is installed on first disk(sda).

The phone works great for calls and text messages, but connecting to mobile data and and navigating the internet it takes a long time to load a page.\nI use the company Iusacell in Mexico.\n\nA: Lusacell might be using WCDMA technology for the data network and I did not find a WCDMA setting in Ubuntu-touch. My earlier Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (android) had that setting and the data network was fast. When I used the same SIM card in BQ Auaris E5, the speed dropped. However I don't have any problem with a GSM data network. It works fine in Ubuntu touch.\n\nA: The E5 Ubuntu Edition is not compatible with GSM networks in Mexico. This is because it is a model for Europe only; and uses the GSM (2G) 850/900/1800/1900 or \"EDGE\" and for 3G and HSDPA (H+) networks using 900/2100.\nIn Mexico the companies use other frequencies for the 3G: \nTelcel 3G: 850 mhz\nAll others (Iusacell, Movistar, etc): 3G: 1900 mhz\nNobody in Mexico using 3G in 900 or 1200 MHz, so your phone only works in 2G, there is no way to operate 3G as it is at the hardware level.\nInterestingly, the LTE frequency Telcel 2100 MHz works the same as \"H+\" of the Ubuntu Phone not assume anything but maybe (and just maybe) worth trying. :)\n", "Q: Secure Auth/Encryption Smart Keyboard Due to the nature of a personal subnet (hardened on the outside, trusting/naive on the inside) I'm starting a project within my network (routed by a Ubuntu 15.04 Desktop with OpenVPN public/local traffic encryption) in which I am aiming for completely paranoid and possibly excessive security to prevent an internal breach (malware installed on a LAN client infecting subnet).\nAmong countless other projects I'm about to engage in is a \"Smart Keyboard.\" I am aiming to prevent certain HID based attacks such as hardware keyloggers and BadUSB exploit. In order to do this I am modifying a standard keyboard, gutting the driver board and installing a micro-controller such as a Teensy to read input voltage, authenticate to computer using rsa/ecdsa or another asymmetric cipher, and encrypt keystrokes in AES with a rolling code synchronized with the computer to avoid the potential for a replay attack.\nThe hardware side seems simple enough, as does encryption and decryption of data. The part where I need help is a lack of understanding in how HID devices communicate with a system, namely Ubuntu (what kind of data can be read by a standard HID device?) as well as how to attach a process to handle decryption of data.\nI have read into /etc/udev/ some and it seems like the execution of scripts is not typically meant for long running applications such as this. How would I go about executing a 'handler' for the keyboard and would this script exclusively receive the data, or would it just be reading stdin since it is a userspace script and HID devices are handled by the kernel?\nLastly, would I be better off to open a 'channel' to the Teensy rather than handling it as an HID device? I am reluctant to do this because this would make the keyboard unusable during boot.\nI'm not necessarily looking for direct answers, but possibly resources for study. I just need someone to point me in the right direction.\nRegards,\nLisenby\n\nA: *\n\n*I'm not an expert, AFAIK, the best is to make a new driver (kernel module) for your new encrypted keyboard.\nHere is project that is small and easy to understand.\n\nLong Name: Linux Microdia Keyboard Chipset Driver\n   Short Name: aziokbd\n   Author: Colin Svingen (Swoogan)\n   Project Home: https://bitbucket.org/Swoogan/aziokbd\n\nIt is using DKMS, so no need for Linux kernel rebuild.\n\n*I lack knowledge about encryption tools so I can't help on how to handle the encrypted data stream.\n\n*udev in short words, it's daemon part of systemd. It helps making dynamic setup/configuration and run customized scripts whenever conditions match either when a device node created, changed or removed from the kernel tree. (/sys is  a Virtual FS that show same tree currently in the kernel).\nIt will help you but it's not what you are looking for.\n\n*Another option, using user-space driver/daemon. In this case, you have to access the USB device using libusb. Same way as xboxdrv (driver for xbox controller) and xsane (tool for scanners).\n", "Q: Fixing a broken RAID5 using mdmadm on Ubuntu 12.04 [QNAP device] One of our QNAP NAS had gone down while alerting on disk thus they were all working/accessible on the array.

So, I'm posting an answer to close this off.\nThis was completely screwed by one of my colleague and it was almost ripped off the moment I had taken this. Due to some recovery applications used without knowing that the drives are actually on a RAID array, it had totally lost it ID's and parities. This was confirmed by the QNAP techs when they took a remove session.\nHowever, I was able to see only QNAP related DATA as they were in a different partition on the drives. I was able to combine the RAID arrays and mount the DATA as well.\nFinal outcome was to rebuild using mdadm with --create which might help or leave me no choice. However, I did not succeed on that which pretty much proves that the arrays are lost and disks are gone.\nNo choice but to bear the pain. Here I close my thread.\nA complete research and command that I had used can be found in \"Fixing a broken QNAP RAID5 using mdmadm on Ubuntu 12.04\". Hopefully, someone might find a clue or two if they ever come across such a situation.\n", "Q: Missing tray icon indicator in recent Spotify versions? I installed the latest Spotify version 1.0.14.124.g4dfabc51. I noticed that version => 1.0 no longer seem to show a tray icon indicator, and thus their windows cannot be minimised. \nIs there a way to bring back the tray icon indicator in these versions?\n\nA: It appears that the tray icon cannot be enabled for the 1.0.x client at this time. The issue appears to be longstanding, and is so mentioned at the Spotify community forums: \"Linux Spotify client 1.x now in stable\"\nRegarding bugs/issues in 1.0.23:\n\nMost of these we want to fix, but others (like missing tray icon) we probably won't.\n\nFor now, Spotify is not willing/able to devote enough development resources to the Linux client. I have remained on the \"spotify-client-0.9.17\" package, while periodically checking the functionality of the 1.0.x testing releases (I have both the \"stable\" and \"testing\" repositories). The '0.9.17' client is disappointingly flakey sometimes (esp. \"Spotify Helper\" processes), but it still gives me a tray icon and panel info/support with 14.04. \n\nA: Here is a workaround \nYou will need kdocker\nEdit the shortcut to spotify to run a similar command :\nkdocker -q -t -i /usr/share/icons/Papirus-Greytika-Alt/32x32/apps/spotify-client.svg spotify\n\n\"-q\" : Disable notification generated by kdocker \n\"-t\" : Hide spotify from task bar\n\"-i\" : Specify a custom tray icon\n\nA: Open the unity tweak tool and goto Unity->Panel->Volume->Default Player and select Spotify.desktop.\nThis worked out for me.\n", "Q: DNS leak test shows other Google ISPs when I use Google 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 nameservers I am trying to fix a DNS leak.  I have changed the nameserver settings to use Google's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 public DNS servers.  However, if I run a DNSleak test it lists the following servers:\n74.125.187.116  none    Google  United States\n74.125.187.113  none    Google  United States\n74.125.187.150  none    Google  United States\n74.125.187.114  none    Google  United States\n74.125.187.115  none    Google  United States\nAlthough the IP address do not match 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, but the ISP is listed a Google. Does this mean it is working? Why is 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 not listed? Is it that the public DNS IPs are redirecting to other location specific IPs or is it that my settings are just not working?\n\nA: Yes, requests to Google's DNS are load-balanced across many servers. To cite from dnsleaktest.com\n\nEven if you have configured a single DNS server, there may be many other servers that the request is passed on to in order to be resolved (normally to load balance the requests). For example if you configure Google DNS then you will often find 6-10 Google DNS servers which are fulfilling the DNS requests.\n\ndnsleaktest works by sending a bunch of DNS requests to your configured DNS servers and performs Whois lookups on the IP addresses that answer. \n", "Q: I want to create an indicator for \"LXDE Panel\" I want to create an indicator for LXDE Panel that prints my GPU temperature by using the following command:\nwatch -n 5 nvidia-smi --query-gpu = temperature.gpu --format = csv, noheader\n\nI just want that mini application prints that number every 5 seconds or 2.

Now i want to open that web page on my phone (Moto X). How can i do this? I am a new user to ubuntu.\n\nA: If you are on the same subnet, you would type your computer's local IP Address (which can be found by running the command ifconfig) into your phone's web browser.\nIf you are on another network (wifi or 3G/4G) you would first need to set up port forwarding on your router so web requests can transverse your NAT. Then you would type your Public IP address into your phone's browser. Your public IP can be found by searching what's my IP on Google, or by the command curl icanhazip.com\nNOTE! Some ISPs block common ports such as port 80 (web server). In this case you would have to use an alternate port number like 8080 and specify this value in your browser.\nFor example, if your public IP is 1.2.3.4 and your port forwarding is set up to the public facing port 8080, you would type 1.2.3.4:8080 into your web browser.\nWord of warning though. If something as simple as pulling up a web page running on a local server requires a question on a forum, you should probably do more research before deploying this server unless you want to be attacked. This is a digital age, one small misconfiguration on that server could compromise your entire network.\nBe safe,\nLisenby\n", "Q: How to turn off NVIDIA graphics on Macbook Pro?

It held for about 3 hours with Mac OS when doing similiar work.\nI've read of two ways of doing that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turning off the discrete graphics device in the BIOS\n\n*or switching to integrated graphics in nvidia-settings.\n\n*UPDATED: Booting into OS X and forcing the integrated graphics in gfxCardStatus 2.2.1.\n\n\nFirst method won't work for me because there is no BIOS on Macbooks. The second method won't work either because I cannot install the propritary drivers, as described above.\nIts a basically fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.04 without any tweaks worth mentioning.\nUPDATE: After reading lots of documentation I've came to the conclusion that this only is possible by using method 3 on Macbook Pro, i.e. one must still have OS X installed, which I haven't! This is really shitty, because it means that I have no chance to turn off the NVIDIA GPU.\n\nA: I happen to have the exact same computer as you. What I devised is to add a few lines to grub to disable the discrete graphics at the efi level: \n$ cat /etc/grub.d/10_linux\n# Use ELILO's generic \"efifb\" when it's known to be available.\n# FIXME: We need an interface to select vesafb in case efifb can't be used.\nif [ \"x$GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX\" = x ]; then\n    echo \"    load_video\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\nelse\n    if [ \"x$GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX\" != xtext ]; then\n        echo \"        load_video\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\n    fi\nfi\nif ([ \"$ubuntu_recovery\" = 0 ] || [ x$type != xrecovery ]) && \\\n    ([ \"x$GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX\" != x ] || [ \"$gfxpayload_dynamic\" = 1 ]); then\n    echo \"    gfxmode \\$linux_gfx_mode\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\nfi\n\necho \"        outb 0x728 1\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\necho \"        outb 0x710 2\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\necho \"        outb 0x740 2\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\necho \"        outb 0x750 0\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\n\necho \"        insmod gzio\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\necho \"        if [ x\\$grub_platform = xxen ]; then insmod xzio; insmod lzopio; fi\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\n\nI just added the outb lines in between the insmod gzio and linux_gfx_mode. For reference:\noutb 0x728 1 # Switch select\noutb 0x710 2 # Switch display\noutb 0x740 2 # Switch DDC\noutb 0x750 0 # Power down discrete graphics \n\nThis disables the graphics at the pcie-link level, such that it vanishes from the system. Unlike macOS, the IronLake Intel HD Graphics can drive the external display output, but without audio. \nWhat you described as the mac disabling igpu unless booting macOS holds true for any mac made after 2010, or any mac with a Sandy Bridge chip or later. (2010=nehalem, 1st gen 45nm.) The apple_set_os.efi trick does not work before 2011 (pre-2011, at the time, anything booted with efi would behave exactly like macOS, efi didn't check the OS, just that it was booted natively, enabling the integrated graphics. And the only way to boot an OS with igpu disabled was to legacy boot, which we are not doing) I tried running it, and it prints that the apple_set_os protocol was not found. I run 16.04.3 stable and it is such a nice experience once you can use the computer without crashes.\nAbout the nvidia proprietary drivers: I did some opengl testing with dolphin-emu and DRI_PRIME=1 booting without outb 0x750, therefore disabling the dGPU's connection to the lvds display, but leaving it available headless for rendering. Nouveau and proprietary have nearly the same performance. (in fact, the majority of edge cases here were won by nouveau) The NV50/Tesla architecture is perhaps the best supported by nouveau. Therefore, I would actually recommend staying on nouveau.\nLastly, to enable intel graphics on boot permanently (as long as nvram variables are not erased) you can do this from linux:\nmount -t efivarfs rw /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/ # make sure efi is mounted\nsudo bash -c 'printf \"\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\" > /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/gpu-power-prefs-fa4ce28d-b62f-4c99-9cc3-6815686e30f9'\n\nYou can also accomplish the exact same thing from macOS as well: \nsudo nvram fa4ce28d-b62f-4c99-9cc3-6815686e30f9:gpu-power-prefs=%01%00%00%00\n\n\nA: For this adapter the correct driver is nvidia-340. It can be installed this way:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-340 nvidia-prime\n\n\nA: This is a hack and should be carefully read through in the sources but possibly this helps you:\nMacbooks deactivate the intel onboard graphic if anything else than MacOS is booted.\nYou could add a file to the efi and add a grub option to chainload it to get the efi to think its booting MacOS so all hardware ist activated during boot.\nget the latest version of the binary efi file from https://github.com/0xbb/apple_set_os.efi/releases\ncopy it to the mounted efi partition into a new sub folder\nmkdir /boot/efi/EFI/custom\ncp apple_set_os.efi /boot/efi/EFI/custom\n\nadd to /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nsearch --no-floppy --set=root --label EFI\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/custom/apple_set_os.efi\nboot\n\nSource:\nhttps://github.com/0xbb/apple_set_os.efi\n", "Q: How can I fix a USB 3.0 Issue in a Ubuntu 14.04 VirtualBox VM For the last few days I have spent a huge amount time searching for a solution to this challenge.\nI have a Seagate Expansion Desktop Drive which is an external 2 TB USB 3.0 disk that I use for testing.

(For quick search use the search function in your browser and write \"USB 3\"). \nIn order to access this new feature you have to install the Extension Pack. \nDownload Here\nIn order to install the extension pack you must right click on the downloaded file and \"Open with...\" virtualbox. \nI don't know if this is the same (in MACs) as in Linux, but you may need add your user in 'virtualbox' group in order to access some features without problems. \n\nA: I was facing the same problem. After upgrade my VirtualBox, I just powered off my virtual machine and in its VirtualBox properties I modified the USB controller for USB 3.0 (xHCI).\nNow, my USB external drive is working fine. \n\nA: I was having difficult with USB3 and USB2. I had loaded Guest Additions and extension pack. Nothing showed. I used lsusb from Linux terminal to identify one device and (while the vm was shut down) created a\n USB3 filter with the Bus, Device, vendor ID, and the Product ID.\nExample: \n\nBus 010 Device 006: ID 1f75:0903 Innostor Technology Corporation. Bus # = The specific USB3 controller.\n\nDevice # is the port on the device. \nID is Vendor ID (initially there may be a 0x before the actual hex address. \nMy device Vendor ID is 1f75 but it showed up as 0x1f75 just use the last 4 digits (same with PRODUCT ID) once I saved that and booted I could see the devices when I started but vbox guest couldn't grab them. \nI grabbed a Windows  usb driver from:\nIntel(Intel(R)USB_3.0_eXtensible_Host_Controller_Driver)\nand installed it, deleted the original filter I created, rebooted the virtual machine and all worked. \n", "Q: Boot problems with Ubuntu on Asus Notebook I had Ubtuntu 14.04 LTS installed (with encrypted homefolder) as dualboot with Win8.1.

Also shutting down and rebooting didnt work normaly, i got to the point where it says system halt now but after that nothing happened so i always had to press OFF for 4 seconds.\nI tried boot-repair in Ubuntu rec mode, that killed it completely. After that it said missing file when i tried to boot.\nSo i formated the Linux partition, assigned that free space to a new partition B:\\ and booted a Windows-Installation-USB, went to command prompt and executed:\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\nthat didnt remove the 2 ubuntu boot options in BIOS though.\nfound out that does not affect the UEFI boot entries.\nWhen i try to launch a Ubuntu or Linux Mint live USB now it always gets stuck at load screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do i remove the Ubuntu boot options that still show up in BIOS?\n\n*whats the Problem with my Notebook that Ubuntu didnt work and no Linux live USB launches anymore?\nThx in advance for your efforts, robomax.\n\nA: I can't fully answer your question, but I can help you to stop wasting time on certain mistakes....\n\nI had Ubtuntu 14.04 LTS installed (with encrypted homefolder) as dualboot with Win8.1\n  ...\n  of course all the time my BIOS settings where on Secure Boot Disabled, and Launch CSM enabled.\n\nOn a computer that shipped with Windows 8 or later, chances are you should NOT be enabling the CSM (aka legacy support). To understand why, first know that you do not have a BIOS; you have an EFI. I know that most people, and even most manufacturers, refer to their EFIs as BIOSes. This leads to confusion, though; EFIs are fundamentally different from BIOSes, and using the term \"BIOS\" to refer to an EFI leads readers to drag in all sorts of BIOS knowledge that's simply wrong when applied to EFIs. The result is people confidently doing things that have worked in the past but that create new problems on their EFI-based computers.\nMost modern EFIs include a Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables the EFI to boot using a BIOS boot loader. This is something like Linux using dosemu or WINE to run DOS or Windows programs in Linux; it's a compatibility layer stuck atop another environment, but it doesn't make EFI a BIOS any more than dosemu makes Linux DOS. Worse, activating the CSM greatly complicates the boot path, making it next to impossible to predict what the computer will do as it boots, at least when it's fed a medium (such as many Ubuntu installation media) that can boot in either way. Will the Ubuntu installer come up in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode or in EFI/UEFI mode? Who knows!? Flip a coin, and don't find out until it's too late, since the boot mode is obvious only if you're an expert! Sorry if I sound sarcastic, but I've seen far too many problem reports related to this issue. See this Web page I've written for more detail on the CSM and the complications it creates.\nThe bottom line, though, is that you should go back into your firmware and disable the CSM. Ubuntu should work with Secure Boot active, but it sometimes causes problems, so disabling it can have some benefits some of the time. OTOH, it also provides at least theoretical protection against some modes of attack, so it's best to leave it active if it doesn't cause you problems. (Problems should be obvious very early, since the system won't get as far as GRUB if Secure Boot blocks it. If it gets past GRUB launching a kernel, it's not a Secure Boot problem, at least not on Ubuntu.)\nI should provide a caveat to all of this, though: The CSM is necessary in some cases, either because you've re-installed Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode or because you've got hardware that requires BIOS-style initialization to work correctly with a Linux driver. Such cases used to be moderately common, but they're rarer today.\n\nI tried boot-repair in Ubuntu rec mode, that killed it completely. After that it said missing file when i tried to boot.\n\nIt could be that this is related to your CSM activation, but I can't be sure of that. If you want help with this, run Boot Repair again and post the URL it spits out.\n\nSo i formated the Linux partition, assigned that free space to a new partition B:\\ and booted a Windows-Installation-USB, went to command prompt and executed:\n\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\nThat's one of the BIOS-specific commands that doesn't work with an EFI-mode boot. Basically, this command re-installs the BIOS-mode Windows boot loader to the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the boot disk. Because an EFI system boots in a completely different way, this command has, at best, no effect on an EFI-mode system. A caveat: Because the CSM introduces unpredictability into the boot process, it's possible that installing a BIOS-mode boot loader in the MBR will cause the computer to try to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, which would just end up causing further breakage. Depending on what the problem is, any number of Windows or non-Windows commands might do something analogous to the command you specified. The main point, though, is that you need to track down EFI procedures to fix boot problems, rather than use BIOS procedures.\n\nHow do i remove the Ubuntu boot options that still show up in BIOS?\n\nIf you're referring to the EFI's boot manager menu, you can remove these from an EFI-mode boot of Linux. Type sudo efibootmgr to see these options (or sudo efibootmgr -v to see more details). Each option has a hexadecimal number, preceded by Boot, as in Boot0003 or Boot001B. You can remove an option with the -b # and -B options to efibootmgr, as in sudo efibootmgr -b 0003 -B to delte Boot0003. There are other ways to do this in other OSes. In Windows, EasyUEFI is a third-party tool that, as its name suggests, makes such manipulations easy. Some EFIs themselves provide such tools, in their setup utilities.\n\nwhats the Problem with my Notebook that Ubuntu didnt work and no Linux live USB launches anymore?\n\nI don't recall seeing your specific issue before, but it looks like either the hardware is defective (either a bad sample of your model or a bad design that affects all samples of your model) or it's new enough that it's not yet supported by the kernel you're using. You say you installed Ubuntu 14.04, but you don't say if that was the original or a point release (14.04.3 is the latest). If it's not 14.04.3, I'd try that; and if that doesn't work, you might try a 15.10 pre-release; see here for download links to the daily builds.\nThere's no evidence that this error has anything to do with EFI, although some of your repair attempts complicated matters by creating CSM-based complications.\n", "Q: Installing Android with LG Skin on Aquaris B5 Ubuntu Edition I am thinking about getting an Aquaris B5 Ubuntu Edition (despite the fact that I am not too tech savvy).\nI was wondering, whether it was possible to install the Android LG Skin on my Aquaris, in case Ubuntu Touch doesn't work for me?\nI currently have a MacBook Pro running OS X 10.10.5 in case that makes any difference. \nThank you for your help!\n\nA: I don't know about Android LG but you can install Android 5.1 for Aquaris E5 from the BQ website:\n\n\nWith the launch of the new Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition, queries are coming in from many BQ users: Can I install the new operating system\n    on my Aquaris E4.5 or E5? The good news is yes, you can, although the\n    tactile button functionality will depend on which system we install on\n    the device.\n\nIf you want to install Ubuntu on an Aquaris E4.5 or E5 with Android,\n  the tactile buttons on the screen will cease to functionality.\nHowever, if you have the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition and want to\n  switch to Android, you will need to bear in mind that although the\n  screen´s tactile buttons are hidden, they will continue to work in the\n  same way as on the Aquaris E4.5 or E5. The only change is that they\n  won´t light up when you switch on the device.\nNow we will look closely at the steps for carrying a hard reset of the\n  device on both Linux and Windows.\nNB: This procedure can only be carried out on the Aquaris E4.5 and E5\n  devices. It is not available for any other BQ device.\nHard reset on Ubuntu\nNB: The tool is only available for the most widely used version of the\n  Linux distribution, 12.04.

Is there any known application which can achieve this? If not, is there anyway of meddling with this myself, I don't need 50/50 for a specific setup I need one program to take up 2/3 and the other 1/3. Would be extremely useful!\nAs said, if a program doesn't exist, what should I be reading up on to get this to work? (A specific shortcut for example for 2/3 and another for 1/3)\nUsing Pantheon as of today.\n\nA: Introduction\nThe script bellow asks user to choose 1/3 or 2/3 resize option for a window, then allows the user to select a window that is to be resized. The window to be resized to 1/3 will jump on the left and 2/3 window will jump on the right. The script can be bound to a keyboard shortcut as necessary.\nPreliminary setup\nThe script relies on wmctrl program to do the job. Make sure it is installed first with \nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nSetting up the Script\n\n\n*\n\n*Create folder in your home folder called bin. You can do so with the command \nmkdir $HOME/bin`\n\n\n*In that folder create a file resizer.sh. Copy over the script below to that file. \n\n*Make sure the script is executable with \nchmod 755 $HOME/bin/resizer.sh\n\n\n*Open System Settings -> Keyboard ->  Shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts.\nCreate a new shortcut and give it full path of the script as command,\nfor example, /home/serg/bin/resizer.sh. \nMy example\nI set up the shortcut first:\n\nThen press the shortcut. The popup menu allows selection of 1/3 or 2/3 resize; I choose 1. Notice, there's no additional input, except a single 1 digit\n\nNext I choose the free-floating browser window. It jumps to the left, now 1/3 in width, desktop height.\n\nSame behaviour will be for the 2/3 option,\nexcep the 2/3 window will be placed on the right side\n\nQuirks\nHaving tested this script, the resizing doesn't work on maximized or left/right split windows (CtrlSuper→/←). Hence, the window must be un-maximized, free-floating.\nScript source\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#--------------------\n# Author: Serg Kolo\n# Date: Sept 26,2015\n# Purpose: a script to resize a window to its\n# 1/3 or 2/3 of width.\n# Written for http://askubuntu.com/q/678608/295286\n#--------------------\n\n\n#---------------------\n# This part takes user input through graphical popup;\n# Input must be 1 or 2, anything else results into an error\n# If user selects 1, we set window to 1/3 of desktop width\n# and place it on the left;\n# If user selects 2,  we set window to 2/3 of desktop width\n# and place it on the right;\nSIZE=$(zenity --entry --text \"Enter (1) for 1/3 and (2) for 2/3 of width\")\ncase  $SIZE in\n    \"1\")NUM=0.333; XPOS=0;;\n    \"2\")NUM=0.667;XPOS=455;;\n    *) zenity --error --text=\"Invalid input\"; exit  ;;\nesac\n#--------------------\n# In this part we determine the geometry of the desktop\n# and then calculate the width that we want the window to \n# be set using bc, the command line calculator\n# printf is used to convert floating point result to \n# integer value, which is required for wmctrl\nROOT_WIDTH=$(xwininfo -root | awk '/Width/ {print $2}')\nROOT_HEIGHT=$(xwininfo -root | awk '/Height/ {print $2}' )\nNEW_WIDTH=$(bc <<< $ROOT_WIDTH*$NUM)\nNEW_WIDTH=$(printf \"%.0f\" $NEW_WIDTH)\n#----------------------\n# This is what actually does the job.\n# wmctrl allows you to select the window with -r :SELECT:\n# and sets that window to specific gravity,x-position,y-position,width\n# height.

And also that is not good to comment them. You will not be able to install some packages if you do it.\nYou can freeze any package including kernel packages by\nsudo apt-mark hold <package_name>\n\nfor example\nsudo apt-mark hold linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic\n\nBut you need to check which kernel meta-package is installed for LTS versions. It may be linux-generic-lts-utopic, etc.\n\nA: If you always update using apt-get upgrade you will not get kernel updates since they will be \"kept back\". You would need to run apt-get dist-upgrade to get kernel upgrades, as well as other system essential upgrades.\nThe real good answer would probably be to hold those packages so that you can get other system-essential upgrades, but this upgrade vs dist-upgrade information can be useful sometimes.\n", "Q: Frequency scaling no longer works after kernel upgrade Using kernel 3.13.0-37, CPU frequency scaling works and I can control it using the CPU frequency control applet.\nI have upgraded to kernel 3.16.0-38, the applet now informs me that CPU frequency scaling is not supported.\nI have checked the kernel config, I have even recompiled the kernel, ensuring that all the different governors are enabled.\nSo I guess my question is \nWhat kernel settings must be enabled for frequency scaling to work?\nI am running Ubuntu 14.04 with Gnome, and I am also running Linux Mint 17.2 with Cinnamon (I know this isn't a Mint forum). Same problem on each.\nThanks for any pointers.\n\nA: Note: This is NOT an answer to the question, but rather a response to the actual root issue.\nThe older kernel, 3.13.0-37, used the acpi-cpufreq CPU frequency scaling driver by default. Apparently that driver was compatible with whatever higher level applet was being used to control CPU frequency scaling.\nThe newer kernel, 3.16.0-38. used the intel_pstate CPU frequency scaling driver by default. Apparently that driver is NOT compatible with whatever higher level applet was being used to control CPU frequency scaling. The information was misleading, and the question was asked based on the belief that there was no frequency scaling when actually there was.\nThe intel_pstate driver has had a problematic history, with sometimes very very bad mistakes. For a time it was disabled by default in Ubuntu. More recently (in the last year) it has been enabled by default again. Myself, I think there are still multiple issues with the intel_pstate driver (and it has been my focus for a very long time now).\nOne can override the default scaling driver via the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line in /etc/default/grub. For example (includes some other stuff that I use):\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"ipv6.disable=1 intel_pstate=disable net.ifnames=1 biosdevname=0 crashkernel=384M-:128M\"\n\nor:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"ipv6.disable=1 intel_pstate=enable net.ifnames=1 biosdevname=0 crashkernel=384M-:128M\"\n\nalways remember (I rarely remember) to:\nsudo update-grub\n\nafterwards.\nA great many users complain that their CPU frequencies are too high with the intel_pstate driver. In many cases it is true. However, one needs to also look at C states (various levels of idle) to really know what is going on with their processor, and if they should be concerned or not. As processors are evolving and deeper C states are available, sometimes using a higher CPU frequency for a task and then going into a deeper C state sooner can result in less energy consumption overall. This is one reason the original maintainer of the intel_pstate driver used the name powersave for the main governor, which is crudely and roughly the equivalent of the acpi-cpufreq ondemand governor. The governor naming is a source of confusion for many users. \nAnyway, a recommended tool for obtaining feedback on C states and such is turbostat. I can not recall what package contains turbostat, because I always compile it myself from the kernel source.

Ctrl+C's interrupt signal is returned with the message use quit to exit. I can use EOF (Ctrl+D) or quit to exit.\nI read thru the difference between ^Z and ^C. Technically, ^C should end the program (and most programs do abort on receiving the interrupt signal). But bc returns a message asking us to use quit instead.\nI was wondering is there a specific advantage in this ?\n\nA: Ctrl+ C sends SIGINT (signal interupt), which makes a process to get interrupted (in other words it kills the process). Some programs can catch this signal and ignore it, which is the case with bc.\nThe Ctrl+ D  character sends EOT (end of transmission) character. Receiving this signal has similar effect as if when a program was reading from file, and reached the end of that file. Effectively, bc is waiting for you to tell it that you have no more input to give.\nAs for why . . . it's up to the developers to specify how the program exits as well as how it interacts with users\n\nA: \nI was wondering is there a specific advantage in this?\n\nYes.

Basically, it will either take the PATH of the user calling it, or if so configured, it will read what is set in the secure_path variable of /etc/sudoers.\nSo, you have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the directory where the php binary is located to the secure path. Run sudo visudo, find this line:\nDefaults   secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:$\n\nand change it to\nDefaults   secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/php53/bin:$\n\n\n*Simply comment out the secure_path line and have sudo share the same path as the invoking user. This is not the safest of choices of course, but it's up to you. To do this, run sudo visudo and add a # to the beginning of the line:\n# Defaults   secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:$\n\nSave the file and exit visudo and you should be able to run sudo php -v as expected. \n", "Q: A little help with a Wine shortcut I've created desktop shortcuts to some Wine (Windows) software I still have to use.\nBut, I couldn't get an specific one works.

Or is this more of a \"edit your host machine's hosts file when you arrive\" and leave the VM on DHCP?\n\nA: You can write a script to determine what network it is on and set the IP accordingly.  e.g., if I'm on a 10.x network, get 10.1.2.3, and if I'm on a 192.x network, get 192.168.1.52.

The new folder icons are generic (easily fixed) and an edit has to be made to ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs to restore them to Nautilus' Places menu, but I cannot figure out how to get them back in the Files quicklist. \n\nA: After some trial and error I've learned that the default user directories are not re-created in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks like new Nautilus bookmarks are, and manually re-adding them to this file fixes this issue with the Files quicklist.\nFollow the format of the existing folders, so for example I opened the bookmarks with nano ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks and put the line file:///home/tom/Documents at the top of the file and this fixed it (change the username in the example to yours, obviously).

I bought a new laptop for college work with Windows 10.

Once it installed though, I found that the screen backlight does not come on after it reaches the boot screen. It works during the BIOS page, but goes off after. The screen itself works, because I can see the images if I put a bright flashlight up to it. Right now and during the install, I have been using an HDMI connection to my TV, which works perfectly, but just can't get the back light to function on the laptop. Using the backlight settings or hotkeys does nothing, and it shows no available drivers I can download. What can I do to fix this? My laptop is using a Mobile Intel® GM45 Express Chipset for graphics and a Intel® Core™2 Duo CPU T6600 @ 2.20GHz × 2 processor. Thank you for any help.\n\nA: This has to do with the ACPI backlight driver for your specific video card in your laptop.

I would like to know if the ubuntu terminal can calculate different combinations (like nCr in math). But I don't want just the number of possible combinations but the combinations themselves.\nUpdate: After more research I found I need not a combination calculator but one that does permutations.\n\nA: Shell itself does have a utility for generating various combinations. I am not quite sure of the technical term for this, but here's how it works:\n$ echo {1,2,3}{1,2,3}{1,2,3}                                \n111 112 113 121 122 123 131 132 133 211 212 213 221 222 223 231 232 233 311 312 313 321 322 323 331 332 333\n\n$ echo {a,b,c}{a,b,c}{a,b,c}                                \naaa aab aac aba abb abc aca acb acc baa bab bac bba bbb bbc bca bcb bcc caa cab cac cba cbb cbc cca ccb ccc\n\n$ echo {0,1}{0,1}{0,1}{0,1}\n0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111\n\nIt's not ideal though, if I remember correctly, i was trying to generate a list of Ukrainian phone numbers (for science purposes, of course), and  ended up with errors. So shell has it's limits. A tool written in a particular programming language, might be of a better use. \n\nA: I don't know of any great command line tools for this, but you can write one easily using python's included itertools library. For example, I just wrote up this script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\n\n\"\"\"\nScript based in part on StackOverflow answer at:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/17434070/generating-all-combinations-of-a-list-in-python\n\"\"\"\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nif len(sys.argv) <= 1:\n    print 'No arguments provided; exiting.'\n    sys.exit()\n\nargs = sys.argv[1:]\ncount = 0\n\nfor combolength in range(0, len(args) + 1):\n    for subset in itertools.combinations(args, combolength):\n        print '#' + str(count) + ': ' + ' '.join(subset)\n        count += 1\n\nAssuming you have python2.3+ installed, you can paste that script into a file called 'combinations.py' and then run this command in a terminal while in the containing directory:\npython combinations.py arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5\n\nIt will accept any number of arguments.\nSo for example, if I want all combinations of the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4, I can run:\npython combinations.py 1 2 3 4\n\nAnd I'll get:\n#0: \n#1: 1\n#2: 2\n#3: 3\n#4: 4\n#5: 1 2\n#6: 1 3\n#7: 1 4\n#8: 2 3\n#9: 2 4\n#10: 3 4\n#11: 1 2 3\n#12: 1 2 4\n#13: 1 3 4\n#14: 2 3 4\n#15: 1 2 3 4\n\nIt doesn't need to be numbers. You can try:\npython combinations.py pig cow duck\n\nand get:\n#0: \n#1: pig\n#2: cow\n#3: duck\n#4: pig cow\n#5: pig duck\n#6: cow duck\n#7: pig cow duck\n\nHope that helped!\nP.S. If you're missing python for some reason, you can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install python\n\nThe default version should be fine.\nUpdate: I made a couple small typos the first time so make sure you review my answer again if you were confused at first.\n", "Q: difference between sudo su - and su - I have tried in Google but couldn't get exactly what I need. \nCould somebody explain the difference between sudo su - & su -\nThank you.\n\nA: From man page su\n\n-, -l, --login\n             Provide an environment similar to what the user would expect had the\n             user logged in directly.\nWhen - is used, it must be specified as the last su option. The\n             other forms (-l and --login) do not have this restriction.\n\nsu allows you to log in as a specific user. You'd get an interactive shell that way. When you use su -  you get a login shell for that user. That's the main difference. For differences between login and non-login shell, check this answer\nNow in case of sudo su -, which acts pretty much the same as sudo su or sudo -i you log in as root, but authenticate with your sudo password.\n\nA: The difference between sudo su - and su - is this:\nWith sudo su - you will be asked to authenticate with your user password (assuming you have sudo privileges).  If you have sudo privileges with no password, then you will not be prompted for a password and instead will be logged into root immediately.\nWith su - you will be asked to authenticate with the root password.  This only works if you have set the root password.\nIn terms of functionality, you can use either one for anything and they will do it the same, but sudo su - can be easier to get into if you have sudo privileges with NOPASSWD.  Please note that having sudo with NOPASSWD enabled is a great security risk on any user that can be accessed over SSH or telnet or any remote login protocol.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.01: inxi -Z -i WAN None detected! I have two servers, both Ubuntu 14.04.01, kernel 3.16.0-49-generic. On both servers I have the same script to detect my WAN ip address and email it to me. In order to get my WAN IP address I'm using inxi -Z -i . On the first everything works fine. On the second inxi gives me \"None detected!\" The version of inxi is the same on both servers: 1.9.17\nCurrently I'm using external source to get my WAN IP address, which I do not like it.\nAny suggestions, ideas? \nThanks \nThanassis\n\nA: You probably were banned from the service is my guess due to abuse. How many times an hour were you running this command? Post the contents of that script that runs that command, that might show the source of the problem.\nWhere are the servers located? And why do they need their WAN checked? Most servers have static IP addresses, except for home things I guess.\nNote that inxi has an option to set alternate IP WAN address source, you have to set the script configuration file with it.\nHowever, inxi requires a specific format, where there is one single line of output from the IP source, and the ip address is the last item in that line of output, I believe it's the last.\nAnyone who plans on sending a large number of requests to remote addresses without prior approval from that source in general can count on getting banned from those services, as a rule. \n\nA: The documentation tells you how to add custom updates to the inxi defaults. The inxi defaults are found at the top of the inxi file. You seem reluctant to say how many times an hour you were running this command on, that's fine, it must have been enough to get banned, so that's whatever. I think you may be unclear on what WAN vs LAN IP addresses are. Your WAN address IS the external address of your router, just as all systems inside LANs have the WAN of their external router that faces the internet. So to get the address of that router requires you going outside your LAN, and then seeing where the request came from. There's tons of places online that give you this information, or you can just set up a simple php script on any web server that echoes out the IP, no need for inxi or anything like inxi: \n<?php echo $_SERVER[\"REMOTE_ADDR\"]; ?>\n\nthat would be the entire contents of that web page/file. You could call it, say, ip.php. Or you can use any other service, inxi  isn't needed, just wget or lynx the file. Like: \nlynx -dump <your url ip tool>\n\nOR \nwget -O <your ip url tool> \n\netc. Lots of ways to do it. Setting up your own external web page for it is the easiest, but any online what is my ip tool works fine as long as you know its output format. Good luck.\n", "Q: Newbie and Can't log into Ubuntu after installation I've just installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my old Toshiba Satellite (L3000-248) which was previously running Windows Vista and which we've recently retired.

I chose Advanced options in the Grub Recovery menu. Chose something related to fixing broken packages. When done, I chose Failsafe mode VGA, then I rebooted. Did that again. Then I chose Normal boot. Once in Ubuntu,I logged in and it would take me back to login again. After the 3rd time it let me in.

How do I resolve this?\n\nA: Here it is, directly from the virtualbox manual\n\nIf you have downloaded installation media from the Internet in the form of an ISO image file (most probably in the case of a Linux distribution), you would normally burn this file to an empty CD or DVD and proceed as just described. With VirtualBox however, you can skip this step and mount the ISO file directly. VirtualBox will then present this file as a CD or DVD-ROM drive to the virtual machine, much like it does with virtual hard disk images.\n[To] mount the ISO . . . directly [from a file] VirtualBox will . . . present this file as a CD or DVD-ROM drive to the virtual machine, much like it does with virtual hard disk images.\nFor this case, the wizard's drop-down list contains a list of installation media that were previously used with VirtualBox.\nIf your medium is not in the list (especially if you are using VirtualBox for the first time), select the small folder icon next to the drop-down list to bring up a standard file dialog, with which you can pick the image file [from the folder containing the downloaded ISO file on your hard-drive].\n\nI would think you would go to hard drive d (if that is where the image is stored) and navigate to the iso file from the drop down menu but I've never ran virtual box on windows, only windows on virtualbox(:\n", "Q: `powertop --auto-tune` without messing with USB and touchpad I like powertop --auto-tune because the speakers of my laptop are soughing when not being used and powertop disables the speakers completely when they're not used, stopping the noise. \nHowever, my USB mouse gets disabled within seconds after not using it and after a few more seconds, my touchpad has a delayed response (works fine after the first delay of a fraction of a second, though).\nHow do I make this stop but still disable my speakers completely when no audio is put out?\n\nA: Try running \"sudo powertop\" and tab over to the \"Tunables\" selection, there it should show you a list of everything that powertop is able to tune. Somewhere on that list will show your something like, \"Autosuspend for USB device...,\" \nOne of the USB devices listed should be the one you are having trouble with; try leaving it's settings as \"Bad\" as that is the unmodified state.\nCheck out the powertop users guide for additional info and tips: https://01.org/sites/default/files/page/powertop_users_guide_201406.pdf\n\nA: Check out my little project to create a shell script to automatically apply powertop's \"good\" power settings.\nYou can then easily edit the resulting script to comment out any configuration that's giving you trouble and run it instead of sudo powertop --auto-tune.\n\nA: If you run powertop --auto-tune manually you could create a script like:\ncat - > powertune.sh <<EOF\n#!/bin/bash\npowertop --auto-tune\nHIDDEVICES=$(ls /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid | grep -oE '^[0-9]+-[0-9\\.]+' | sort -u)\nfor i in $HIDDEVICES; do\n  echo -n \"Enabling \" | cat - /sys/bus/usb/devices/$i/product\n  echo 'on' > /sys/bus/usb/devices/$i/power/control\ndone\nEOF\n\nThe script will run powertop and then look at all the USB devices using the Human Interface Device driver and subsequently disable power management for them. So it should be resistant to plugging mice/keyboard in different ports.\nYou could also combine it with a systemd service to run it automatically at bootup.\n", "Q: Touchpad drivers for Asus K501LB I'm looking for drivers for my touchpad on the Asus K501LB.

This app uses the command line to create a WiFi access point with this command:\ncreate_ap wlan0 eth0 MyAccessPoint\n\nand you can also make a WPA + WPA2 network with this command:\ncreate_ap wlan0 eth0 MyAccessPoint MyPassPhrase\n\nbut to do this you are entering the password, and it is in the terminal in plain text.\nIt can of course be removed from history, or never added by prepending a space to the command, but it is still typed in and is listed untill you close that terminal.\nMy question is if this is less secure than setting up a WiFi network with a GUI app that doesn't store it in the same way.\n\nA: Anything that is passed as a command line parameter can be viewed by:\n\n\n*\n\n*anyone who can see the terminal contents while they still are on screen (as you said);\n\n*any program that has access to your history file until you remove it from there, or if you prevent it from being written (as you said);\n\n*any user on the system that lists the processes using ps or similar tools.\n\n\nIt is bad practice.\nQuoting from the page you linked to: \"You can pass your SSID and password through pipe or through arguments (see examples).\".

I've got it connected to my roommate's Xbox 360 with an Ethernet cable, so the Xbox can share its Wi-Fi connection. This works well. After I edited the IPV4 settings of the \"Wired Ethernet\" connection to share with other computers, I don't even have to sign in- the connections all work on the sign-in screen.\nMy question is, what settings can I change to optimize this even more? Ideally, I'm thinking of making a new user account that my roommates can sign into that would only provide the networking- no desktop environment or anything, just a dummy connection-forwarding account with a blank screen (or a powered-off screen, or the ability to close the lid without the connection being lost). I want to do this to avoid wasting electricity, burning in my screen, or risking unfamiliar users changing the wrong settings in a real account or from the sign-in screen. Is something like this already available? Where do I start?\n\nA: Normally if you check \"Available to all users\" for a connection, NetworkManager brings it up when the system boots, no login required. That would solve the login problem.\nYou can also let your roommate use the Guest account.\nFor blanking the screen, see Ubuntu 12.10 \"Turn screen off when inactive for: Never\" still turns off\n", "Q: Inter container network communication blocked in docker I am starting with docker and I have decided to spin up my gitlab instance in a container as well as gitlab-ci-multi-runner to perform my CI builts (just to test the possibilities of the flow).\nSpinning up gitlab instance is pretty straightforward using sameersbn/docker-gitlab on github. \nThe problem arises when I try to run gitlab-ci-multi-runner which needs to authorize itself with gitlab through inter container network on the host.\nSo I try to spin up the runner container with docker-compose up with the following docker-compose.yml:\nGitlabCIMultiRunner:\n  image: sameersbn/gitlab-ci-multi-runner:0.5.5\n  external_links:\n    -

You may need to get the appropriate tools and image for doing so, from your device manufacturer.\n", "Q: Can not play video, can not figure out why I have this video film that I can not play, and I try to figure out why, on ouput of mediainfo -l I get this:\nComplete name                            : 101064-HD-FR.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 1.54 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 26mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 550 Kbps\nTagged date                              : UTC 2014-10-24 09:15:53\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.1.100\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L4.0\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : No\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : encv / avc1 / mp4a\nDuration                                 : 1h 26mn\nBit rate                                 : 2 404 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.104\nStream size                              : 1.45 GiB (94%)\nTagged date                              : UTC 2014-10-24 09:15:53\nEncryption                               : Encrypted\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 1h 26mn\nDuration_LastFrame                       : -5ms\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 138 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 84.9 MiB (5%)\nTagged date                              : UTC 2014-10-24 09:15:53\nEncryption                               : Encrypted\n\nWhen trying to play with mpv (tried other players also), I get this:\n[libav/audio] aac: Sample rate index in program config element does not match the sample rate index configured by the container.\n[libav/audio] aac: Sample rate index in program config element does not match the sample rate index configured by the container.\n[libav/audio] aac: Input buffer exhausted before END element found\n[libav/demuxer] mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2: max_analyze_duration 5000000 reached\n (+) Video --vid=1 (*) (<unknown>)\n (+) Audio --aid=1 --alang=und (*) (aac)\nFailed to initialize a video decoder for codec '<unknown>'.\nVideo: no video\n\n\nA: It's Encrypted.

It will be running without adverse consequences if trusty is compatible with precise applications, in general, or specifically with respect to CryptoTE.\nThe CryptoTE website shows that CryptoTE evolved as Ubuntu evolved, but does not necessarily imply that the above suggestion will fail because a new version of CryptoTE is necessary for trusty.\nIf this suggestion is followed, the third worst thing that could happen is that valuable data will be inaccessible, LOL, until somebody obtains the source code, which is readily available, at least at the present time, and modifies the program for trusty.\nThe second worst thing that could happen is that CryptoTE runs in a buggy way that allows you to add data that will later become inaccessible.\nThe worst thing is that CryptoTE runs in a buggy way and that the source code becomes unavailable.\n", "Q: what causes this error by `apt-get update` What causes this error when sudo apt-get update is issued?\nW: GPG error: http://download.virtualbox.org trusty InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 54422A4B98AB5139\n\nSequence of events: \nInstall 14.04 (trusty), install VirtualBox from Ubuntu Software Centre and find it does not work, un-install VirtualBox using Ubuntu Software Centre, install from virtualbox.org using the Debian instructions at the link, issue apt-get update.\nvirtualbox.org, Instructions for Debian\nEdit: There has been a response that suggests that this question is answered at a certain link. I read the answers at the link. This question is different. At the link we see how to resolve the error. This question is different because it asks for the cause. It does not ask for a resolution. This is my response to the link above about the \"easiest way to resolve\". I will check the comments and revise this edit if necessary.\n\nA: Whenever we add a repository for installing packages we also need a GPG key used by apt to authenticate packages for security reasons. \nWhen adding a Launchpad hosted PPA this key will automatically be downloaded to use. So we do not have to do anything in addition.\nThis is different when adding an external repository such as the Oracle repository for Virtual Box. We then have to manually download and add the signing key. To do this the following steps are involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*add the repository to our sources\n\n*download the GPG key\n\n*add this key for authentication\n\n*update our apt cache\n\n*install the desired software package\n\n\nThere are many different ways to achieve this, from command line or with graphical tools which I will not further elaborate here.\nFor adding the key there is a single-line command from the Virtual Box download page which always had worked for me:\nwget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -\n\n\nA: The problem is that the command provided by the virtualbox website suggests adding the key using a command that simply will not work and also doesn't provide any error as to why. \nRunning the commands individually instead of in their piped form revealed there is what appears to be a DNS problem with wget. Here's the error I received:\nuser@computer:~$ wget https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc\n--2015-09-26 21:11:57--  https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc\nResolving www.virtualbox.org (www.virtualbox.org)... failed: Temporary failure in name resolution.\nwget: unable to resolve host address ‘www.virtualbox.org’\n\nUse aria2 instead (aria2 is way more advanced and reliable than wget anyhow but that's another discussion).\nBecause there is a DNS problem when using wget, I suggest using aria2 to download the key instead. \nFirst, install aria2:\nsudo apt-get install aria2\n\nThen, run the following command to add the key:\naria2c https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc; sudo apt-key add oracle_vbox.asc; rm oracle_vbox.asc\n\nFinally, you should be able to run the following without issue:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThe following is an example of what you should see if adding the key is successful. Most importantly, it should say (OK):download completed. and OK on the last two lines respectively.\nDownload Results:\ngid   |stat|avg speed  |path/URI\n======+====+===========+=======================================================\ncff9ac|OK  |    33KiB/s|/home/H2ONaCl/oracle_vbox.asc.1\n\nStatus Legend:\n(OK):download completed.\nOK\n\nPlease post any errors.\n\nA: It was probably because the part of the instructions at virtualbox.org that instructed to \nsudo apt-key add oracle_vbox.asc\nwas not performed. \nThere was no intention to use HTTPS so that command was skipped. VirtualBox installed successfully without use of apt-key add. It was probably a less secure way to install. \n", "Q: WiFi suddenly not working I brought my Dell Latitude E6410 running Ubuntu 15.04 to a place where there was public WiFi.

Then I ran the following code in terminal as recommended in Step 1: \nlspci -nn -d 14e4:  \n\nThis told me that the PCI ID of my wireless card was [14e4:4311] (rev 01). Looking in the Broadcom wireless table in step 3, I saw that I would need firmware-b43-installer. Then in terminal, I ran:\nsudo apt-get update  \n\nfollowed by:\nsudo update-pciids\n\nas recommended in Step 2. I then found by trial and error that I had to run the following in terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source  \n\nas suggested at the end of Step 1 even though I had not manually installed the bcmwl-kernel-source package.\nI then ran the following in terminal from Step 3: \nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer  \n\nand afterward shut down the computer and unplugged the Ethernet cable from the laptop. After powering up the laptop and logging into Ubuntu, the network menu detected wireless networks and I was able to select my own, and login to it successfully.\n", "Q: Fstab doesn't mount with exec I have an ext4 partition that I mount using the following fstab line\nUUID=41dec246-654d-4e35-9d4e-68150e40c5b0 /mnt/Data     ext4    defaults,user      0      2\n\nBut then I realized that I can't execute from that partition. I checked my mount options and they were: rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev\nSo I changed the mount options to be more explicit as follows:\nUUID=41dec246-654d-4e35-9d4e-68150e40c5b0 /mnt/Data     ext4    rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,user,async      0      2\n\nBut the partition still mounts with the same options (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev).\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04 and I'm using UEFI booting. I'm also dual-booting with Windows 8.1\n\nA: Change that line to\nUUID=41dec246-654d-4e35-9d4e-68150e40c5b0 /mnt/Data     ext4    rw,suid,dev,auto,user,async,exec      0      2\n\nThe position of exec is important, since user also applies noexec.  By putting exec after user, you ensure that exec is set.  The most important options should be listed last.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server Installation is Getting Stuck I have been trying to install Ubuntu server on my IBM x3550 server to replace windows server; and the installation was doing just fine until it reached \"Running live-installer-console-setup\" at which point everything stops, and the progression bar never moves past 76% no matter how much time I give it. The version I am trying to install is 14.04 and the hardware is as follows: - 2x SAS IBM HDD 70.6GB in RAID - IBM serverRaid-8k raid card - 2x Intel Xeon E5245 - 4x 4GB ddr2 memory\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nA: I eventually got my install to work by removing the RAID card from my server.  I also changed the boot drive to be a plain SATA drive, I was trying motherboard raid 1 for a redundant boot drive, once that was done the install completed.  I was then able to plug the RAID card back in and access the files on the array.  \n\nA: I just ran into the same symptoms. I was installing some test VMs within Hyper-V and got stuck at the same screen. I clicked on the windows and hit enter a couple of times, and then selected Shutdown in the Hyper-V connection toolbar which immediately got things rolling again... despite that there is now a little progress indicator at the bottom of the Hyper-V window, I am now on configuration of the package manager. \n", "Q: How to set Ubuntu Server to ipv4 network address I am setting up Ubunut Server version 14 (32 bit) in an Oracle Virtual Box. Install went well and the network is set to Bridged so that the VM uses the host (Win1064bit) network card.\nOnce logged into Ubuntu the ifconfig gives me a ipv6 address starting with fe80::\nThe rest of my home network runs on ipv4. and my router (Fritzbox) shows the Ubuntu has been assigned an ipv4 address. When I try the address in the browser on my localhost it times out. I am unsure what to do.\na) is it preferable to force Ubuntu to use an ipv4? if so how? b) is there a way for me to reference the ipv6 via Chrome/browser?\nWhat would you do?\n\nA: If it were my machine, I would edit the /etc/network/interfaces file.  Here's an example of what the eth0 entry should look like:\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.50\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.1.254\n\nSomewhere towards the top of the file, there should be a line that says\nauto eth0\n\nOr something like\nauto lo eth0 (basically, \"auto blahblahblahblah eth0\")\n\nThis will automatically bring up eth0 with the IP you specify under address.  Make sure you choose the right netmask (sometimes referred to as subnet mask) and gateway (usually the IP address of your router).\nIf you do all this, you should have a fully functional IPv4 connection.\n"]
