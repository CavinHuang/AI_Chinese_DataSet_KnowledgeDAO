I want to make them available for inclusion in a Smart Playlist, but they need to be played as a group, and in order.  \nSimilarly, the Canadian Brass \"All You Need Is Love\" has four \"Intro to ...\" tracks, about a minute in length, that should be played together with the song they introduce.\nIs there any way in iTunes to mark multiple tracks which a Smart Playlist could pick as an ordered group?\nExample:\nTrack   Name\n  1     Song of Jasmine\n  2     Intro to Kittens\n  3     Song of Kittens\n  4     Song of Humor\n  5     Intro to Geology\n  6     Song of Geology Part 1\n  7     Song of Geology Part 2\n\nJasmine, Kittens, Humor, and Geology are not especially related and can be played separately and in any order, but it is not pleasing to hear just the Intro, or just one of the parts of Geology.\nHow do?\n\nA: This is what the “Grouping” field is for. For all tracks in a group, enter the same text in the “Grouping” field. Then choose Controls → Shuffle → By Groupings — note that this setting is only in the menu bar, not in the Preferences!\nWith that setting, any track whose Grouping field is not empty will be played together with other tracks with the same Grouping, presumably in track number order.\n\nA: The only option I know consists, as Nathan say, to join the tracks together into one track (but I suggest to keep originals tracks in case you want to play them manually).\nKeep the joined track alongside the others, and make the original tracks non selectable by the smart playlist :\n  - by filtering on 'Grouping' field. E.g, by excluding all tracks whose 'Grouping' field is equals to string 'Yes'\n  - or activating the 'Skip when shuffling' bit should do the trick\n", "Q: Where is the forward delete button in iPhone’s keyboard? Where is the left-to-right delete button in iPhone’s keyboard? We have backspace but where is Delete?\n\nA: There is no \"forward delete\" key (as it's often called) on the iPhone. The same is true on the Mac. \nOn the Mac you can hold down the Fn (Function) key and press the Delete key to get forward deletion, but there's nothing on the iPhone.\n", "Q: Is there a way to reset my iphone 4 to fix this problem All of a sudden, my Voice Control on my iphone 4 keeps beeping and making noises, and it's starting songs on the music player and making the whole phone go haywire.\nI turned the phone off and on again but the problem persists. Is there a way to replace the whole system or do something else that might fix it\nThe phone was working perfectly yesterday and every other day since last October when I bought it\n\nA: It sounds like a reset is probably the most likely thing to fix this. It will reset your iPhone to factory settings, and then put back your settings and media from a backup.\nYou can rest your iPhone by connecting it to iTunes, selecting it in the sidebar, going to the General tab, and clicking Restore.\nTake a look at the Restoring Your iPhone section of this Apple support document for more info.\n\nA: Before you go down the full Restore route double check that restoring it to basic content and settings (Settings -> General -> Reset) doesn't help. It's fixed a few things for me before.\n", "Q: Triggering an alarm on MBP while the lid is closed I would like to use an alarm clock application on my MacBook Pro. The thing is, that I need to close the lid on the MBP while sleeping. Now I know this is a common issue, but after moderate amount of Googling I haven't found any reasonable solution. Some solutions are already old, do not work on 10.6.7 or the current line of MBP.\nThis application almost works. It has everything alarm clock should have. It can wakes the computer from sleep as well. It has some problems with closed lid though. The alarm fires of, but after like 3 seconds it auto snoozes. After snooze cool down expires the same thing happens again. If the lid is open and MBP is sleeping the application works just fine. \nCan anyone recommend any other application? \nps. Now I know, that running MBP closed is not recommended due to possible overheating, but all need it the alarm clock, so after 10-20 seconds I will manually turn it off, so it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nA: I used to use InsomniaX, but it has stopped working with the recent updates, and the developer's site says he's stop development. However, I found a similar app that works called InsomniaT. It's not quite as useful as InsomniaX, but it gets the job done.\n\nA: If you need to close the lid because the screen display is keeping you awake, can I suggest ctrl-shift-eject as a quick shortcut to turn off the display, whilst leaving the machine running as normal?  I use it all the time in the scenario you are describing.\n\nA: There are two actions at play here, and if you'd to consider as two separate actions, you'd be able to explain what you've observed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sleep. Sleep can be triggered in several ways. Inactivity (under Energy Saver), explicit (by you via keyboard or GUI) and lid close.\n\n*Lid Close. Will usually trigger a sleep, but it need not be.\nAll the alarm apps mentioned on this page is unaware of \"lid close\". So the following infinite loop occurs:\nAlarm triggers -> wake from sleep -> detect lid closed -> sleep -> alarm triggers -> wake from sleep -> detect lid close -> sleep -> ....\nThe answer to this question lies in taking a step back and trying to understand what you're trying to achieve, and solve it using a different line of thought.\n", "Q: Auto open textmate project on startup How do I get textmate to remember what project i had open last and reopen it automatically?\nRight now I have to select it from the menu.\n\nA: By default TextMate should open the last open project or document - but it can be switched on/off - maybe it is off by you ??\nHere is how to switch the feature on/off: http://manual.macromates.com/en/expert_preferences#oakdisablesessionrestore\n\n22.7 OakDisableSessionRestore\nWhen you launch TextMate it will open the project / document which was open when you last exited. You can however disable this feature by running:\ndefaults write com.macromates.textmate OakDisableSessionRestore 1\n\nThis means that you should run the above line in a Terminal - with a 0 instead of 1\n\nA: This command allowed me to re-open a project (I'm running Mountain Lion):\n    defaults write com.macromates.textmate NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool NO\n\nTextMate needs to be closed when you issue Terminal commands, otherwise they will not work.\nSee this page for more information.\nMake sure you created a TextMate project using TextMate. In other words, do not drag a folder into TextMate and assume that all the open-file states to be reloaded.  You must have a .tmproj file into which you drag your files into.\n", "Q: Video Editing Software - MKV? I want to edit MKV video files (anime). Naturally I want to use iMovie / Final Cut. But sadly they can't import MKV?\nWhat is the recommended thing to do? Should I convert the files first or use a different software that does support MKV?\nI'm a total newbie to video editing so I have no real attachment to any software, thanks!\n\nA: Yes, I would recommend to convert it to a format that iMove can import. MKV is just a container format so  you probably already have an iMovie-compatible inside that package. Under Snow Leopard just install Perian and open it in QuickTime X and then go to File->Save as ... and choose a suitable format from the dropdown menu.\nIf you need more control over your conversion, you could also convert it to an iMovie-compatible format using any of the video conversion tools available for the Mac. For a long time VisualHub was the king of video format conversion, unfortunately techspansion the company behind it, closed its virtual doors. There are two main open-source options derived from VisualHub, ReduxZero and TranscoderRedux they both should do the trick. Another option is Subler which will also convert to and from MKV video containers to an iMovie-compatible format.\n\nA: You can also change the container with ffmpeg:\nfor f in *.mkv;do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c copy \"${f%mkv}mov\";done\n\nffmpeg can also be used to for example save a segment as a new file:\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c copy -ss 0:37:55 -t 0:0:5 37.55-to-38.00.mkv\n\nYou can use mkvtoolnix to add or remove subtitles:\nmkvmerge -i input.mkv # --identify\nmkvmerge -o output.mkv input.mkv -S # remove all subtitle tracks\nmkvmerge -o output.mkv input.mkv -s 3,4 # remove subtitle tracks 3 and 4\nmkvmerge -o output.mkv input.mkv subs.srt # add subtitle track\nmkvextract tracks input.mkv 3:subs.srt # save track 3 as subs.srt\n\n", "Q: How to sync multiple calendars (Exchange/Google) on a Mac? I have 2 calendars, connected to my Mac in iCal (but I am not wedded to that app);\n\n\n*\n\n*Work provided Exchange calendar\n\n*My Google Calendar (also work, but provided by me)\n\n\nI want to have both calendars in sync.. I like Google Calendar because I can use it over the web and I am just super happy and comfortable with it, I like the Exchange one to be in sync so everyone else can see my schedule.\nI have another problem which I am trying to implicitly solve with this solution, and that is that invites no longer show up properly in GMail (they are plain text and I cannot \"accept\" them). They do show up however in my desktop mail app..\nI would like to know if anyone have any ideas of an app for Mac/OSX (or even an online service) that can keep both calendars in sync (even with some restriction) with minimal ongoing manual work? I've Googled for a few hours with no result..\nThanks a lot in advance..\nDaniel\n\nA: Spanning Sync ($25/year) should do this. However, when I tried to use it I kept getting a crash (version 3.2/443). \nBusySync ($39.99) should also do this [edit: I just got a note from BusySync support saying that this does not work for Exchange]. \n\nYou may now add and edit events, in iCal or Google, on any of the calendars you published or subscribed to, and the events will sync in both directions between iCal and Google.\n\nHowever, when I set up my Exchange calendar to publish to Google, and modified the calendar inside the Google Calendar interface, the new modifications get clobbered the next time BusySync syncs. It does at least successfully publish the events on Google Calendar, though.\n", "Q: front light blinking and beep sound Just two days back, I bought a MacBook Pro. I have just decreased the resolution of the display and started one game. Suddenly, my MacBook made an annoying beep sound and the front light was also blinking. After I restarted the system, everything seemed fine.\nI just want to know what the problem was?\nEdit: So the problem is reproducible. Whenever I start the game, the MacBook Pro starts flashing the front light and beeping.\n\nA: You need to let us know how many times the light blinks, because they are diagnostic indicators. If it's blinking 3 times then pause, then 3 times again then it's an indication of a bad RAM. If it beeps 3 times, it's also an indication of bad ram.\nHowever, if it blinks 5 times and pauses, then the battery might need diagnostics or replacing. So check. \n", "Q: Change network location automatically based on network \nPossible Duplicates:\nCan the built-in OS X “Location” feature auto select locations based on wireless networks?\nCan I automate location changing so I don't have to drive the choice manually?\nStart/stop internet sharing from a script?\n\nIs it possible in Mac OS X to somehow make it change the network location from a custom location profile to automatic when leaving the home network without having to manually adjust the settings in system preferences?\n\nA: Although not automatically, a shorter way to go is in the menu: apple->Location and then choose your location,.\n\nA: Airport Location** does that. \n** Update 10/2016: Airport location appears to be no longer maintained, but still available at MacUpdate.com. It may be limited to older versions of OS-X. The same site suggests ControlPlane provides similar functionality; I have not used it.\n", "Q: Risk vs benefit of using LastPass on Chrome in OS X? Some time ago I made the switch from Firefox to Google Chrome. When I was on Firefox I was a heavy user of LastPass. Part of the reason was that Firefox didn't use OS X's excellent Keychain Access program for password management. Is this still the case?\nNow I've been on Chrome for quite some time and I am pleased with the way it integrates with OS X, exp. re: Keychain Access.\nThere is a LastPass extension for Google Chrome. I wonder if I'm missing out on much by not using it. I also wonder if, in some ways, my data are less secure if I put all my stuff out there 'in the cloud'. Thinking of recent missteps by Dropbox et al. makes me a little queasy. There are other concerns such as making a large number of highly random passwords and storing them in LastPass, only for LastPass to be sold. All of a sudden I'd have quite a task on my hands to get all those random passwords back.\nWith these things in mind, is it advisable to use, and rely upon, LastPass in a Chrome-only OS X environment? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I don't have enough experience and knowledge of the LastPass folks to answer your questions. The dropbox issue is a non-issue if the data stored on the site was encrypted well before it ever was sent off your computer.\nIn general, I have different criteria for selecting software that is critical for me. Some random plug in, pictures, a cool app that doesn't store say, banking information. I'm all about giving people the benefit of the doubt.\nMy core operating system and my password generator/manager isn't time for that sort of experimentation. I am very happy using 1Password and understand their business model. Yes, for a time it was free, but it was obvious that they had a sustainable and reasonable pricing model. Now that they have (I hope) millions of users, they can charge a modest cost to ensure they have great response, great support and most importantly, great engineering. I will make more allowances for initial downsides when I believe more in the long term decisions of the company making my core tech and less likely to dabble in newcomer efforts (no matter how worthy they seem).\nI would evaluate whatever software you choose by trying LastPass, 1Password and several others with fake data, but not trust your critical information to software until you are comfortable knowing who made it, how they secure data, and that they won't likely sell out to a low bidder at the first wave of $25k.  The value of millions of people to add to a corporate mailing list is attractive to owners that don't have an otherwise viable business model. I try hard not to be part of their short sell-off strategy by giving them my most valuable information for free.\nI hope this helps you frame your decision and someone else that has gotten comfortable with LastPass weighs in with their take on your questions. It's a good one and high time more users start holding their authentication credentials a little closer and more securely between sites.\n", "Q: Uninstalling applications on Mac \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I uninstall a program completely on a Mac? \n\nHow is the correct way to uninstall applications on Mac OS?\nI've noticed that almost zero of them have a Uninstall utility...\nCurrently I'm just Deleting the shortcuts of the dock, and removing the app files of Application folder, but I think this is not the best way, because many apps install libs on other system folders.\nWhat is the best approach?\n\nA: There is a reason for Applications not to have uninstaller in most cases. This is because they don't need one. OS X apps are generally containing all necessary libraries in the *.app package. If that's not the case, then an app should have an unistaller.\nSo generally speaking just deleting a shortcut from dock and removing *.app package is enough if there is no uninstaller.\nOn the other hand apps also need to store data like preferences, etc. These are located in Library folders (/Library and/or ~/Library). If you want to get rid of these too, your best choice is to use a 3rd party unistaller. A great example would be AppCleaner, which is free or commercial AppZapper. If you use ForkLift, it has a built-in tool for this as well. All these basically go through Library area to find all files and folders created by the app you want to delete and allow you to choose whether to delete them or not.\nYou may want to have a look at this thread too:\nAny recommendations for a before&after software installation scanner/uninstaller?\n", "Q: Does iOS 4 break iPhone compatibility with music docks? When I plug my iPhone 4 into my Bose SoundDock Series 2 I get a popup message saying \"This accessory is not optimized for this iPhone\" and the dock will not play audio from the iPod or Pandora apps, presumably others as well.  (Interestingly, if the iPod is playing music from its built-in speakers it will play through the Bose briefly when I plug it in but stops with the popup.)  Fearing a problem with the SoundDock I tested on my father-in-law's iHome speakers and I get the same message and audio failure.\nThe \"Apple Support Communities\" pages have many threads with people discussing the same problem and it appears to be a bug introduced with iOS 4.  I've ensured I'm up-to-date with iOS 4.3.3 (8J2) but it seems to exist with every iOS 4 version.\nAre there any known workarounds?  (Enabling Airplane mode doesn't work.)  Is there a planned fix or official statement from Apple?\n\nA: The answer from Apple Support is \"Yes\", newer versions of the iOS software probably do disable support for \"older\" iPhone-compatible devices (although likely \"unintentionally\").\nThe Apple Support representative advised downgrading the iOS version on my phone even though doing so would violate the terms of my AppleCare agreement (and obviously, she couldn't explain how to do it other than giving me some Google search terms).\nMoreover, she stated that with the release of iOS 5 coming up that I should hesitate to purchase any Apple iPhone or iPod accessories because they cannot ensure compatibility.\nUnbelievable.\n", "Q: Is there a replacement glass panel for iPad that is \"matte\"? I had broken my Unibody MacBook screen and took the opportunity to replace it with a matte screen, via TechRestore.  I loved the improvement, as I dislike glossiness in almost every context.  Even my car is painted matte!\n\n\nAnyways, I stupidly broke the glass on my 3G iPad1 today and want to replace the glass with a \"matte\" version...  Is there anything like this anywhere?\nI know I can get a film or what not, but it's just not as satisfying.  So far, I've found a steady stream of probably-good-enough faux-OEM glass panels on eBay starting at $50 each (with the hilariously name spooge tool, included!)\nBut they're all glossy!!  I hate the gloss!!\nDoes anyone know where I can get some matte replacement glass for my iPad?\n\nA: If I were you I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*repair screen at local apple authorized service provider\n\n*cover new new screen with a new matte screen protector for ipad 1\n\n1 Please read reviews before buying one, because some people complain about different issues like a little blurred screen, grain etc.\n", "Q: Wifi disconnects frequently in Macbook Pro 13\" I am new to Macbook Pro and Mac OS X. I am experiencing irritating problem. My internet wifi gets disconnected frequently. \nIs this a problem with my internet provider or Mac book pro? I bought MBP just two weeks back. I am worried wether I got the defective laptop or what?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If the network you're connecting to uses WEP encryption, try switching it to WPA. You might remember a similar issue around the launch of iPad 2.\n\nA: Make sure you don't have multiple entries in your Keychain for the same network.  Sometimes it will get confused, try to use the wrong password and fail to connect.\n\nA: I have the same problem and call the AppleCare support to try to solve the problem. Here are the steps I performed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Renew the IP address via System preferences... / Network / Advanced... / TCP/IP / Renew DHCP\n\n*Shut down my Mac\n\n*Starting my Mac with Cmd + Alt + R + P\n\nA: Could be several causes, but first one I'd check is interference from other local WiFi networks, or from other electrical devices in your home. \nAn app like iStumbler will let you check if there are any nearby WiFi networks broadcasting on the same channel as yours -- if there are, you can set your router to use a different channel and see if that helps.\nHarder to pin down interference from other electrical devices, but in general, make sure your router is as far away from other potential sources of interference as possible -- that includes cordless phone base stations, microwave ovens etc. This is less of a problem now than it used to be, but it can still occasionally cause problems.\n\nA: Try your notebook on few other wifi networks.\nIf on all you get disconnects, probably your macbook is broken. If in others your connection is OK, your current wifi have problems, what can be:\n\n\n*\n\n*DSL disconnects (some routers drop wifi too, when got DSL disconnect)\n\n*problems with wifi access point\n\n\n*\n\n*try disable encryption - or try change encryption scheme\n\n*try tweak some setting in the access point (e.g. channel or soo)\n\n*try this command for get some info\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I\n\n\n*can also try change channel number with the above command (for the help, run it without arguments)\nOther:\n\n\n*\n\n*stop microwave owen ;)\n\n", "Q: Is there a calorie-counting iPhone app that knows about UK foods? Are there any calorie-counting/nutrition/exercise-tracking iPhone apps that include significant numbers of foods from popular UK stores (e.g. Tesco, Sainsbury, Waitrose) in their databases, please?\nI've tried out MyNetDiary, and it has very few (a couple of dozen or so) items from each of the stores mentioned above.\nI've looked at UKPoints, and its UI looks quite primitive.\nI've also looked at PureLifeStyle, and the reviews don't sound overly promising. Also, I can't get the demo to work on their website (in IE 9) which doesn't fill me with much confidence.\n\nA: I use the MyFitnessPal app when on my iPhone and I use their website when on my Macbook Pro and find them to be easy to use. They do list the foods you're mentioning on their website here (the list is enormous, look around):\nhttp://www.myfitnesspal.com/brand/list/585\nI'm in the USA so make sure they have the foods you want before signing up / buying the iPhone app.\n", "Q: Which websites provide alternative listing of Mac App Store content? For iOS there is quite a few websites providing a alternative ways to browse through the many apps and also provides neat info about it's popularity.\nWhat websites are there for the Mac App Store?\nI already know of AppShopper.\nThe reason I'm asking is because I wish there was an \"add app to wishlist\" feature and a way to see comments across the world and an easier way to look through the lists beyond the limit of 50 apps (I know of the See All, but..). And for a lot of other reasons.\n\nA: AppsOnSale is a Mac app that shows an alternative listing of apps than the MAS.\n\nA: Matt Neuberg from TidBITS reviewed a service called \"Appalicious\" last fall. He was impressed with the various ways Appolicious had to slice and dice Mac App Store information.

We know that iPad 2 performance is higher than the performance of the original iPad  (Safari, Games, etc).\nBut whether iPad 2 user experience is better in opening and reading heavy-weight PDFs than original iPad?\nUPDATE: Consider heavy-weight pdf is a magazine or pdf book with a large number of illustrations, so there is almost no scripts, flash, etc — just pure text with links and images (e.g. pdf files about 80Mb).\n\nA: The iPad 2 is most likely to be faster than the original iPad as it has the newer A5 processor, which is dual-core and faster than it's predecessor, the A4. The iPad 2 also has 512MB RAM, which is 2 times more than the original iPad. This means that the rendering of the images will be faster, and more parts of the PDF can be stored in memory for a longer period of time, ensuring a smooth read.\nThis article also shows the difference between the speed of the PDF rendering and other factors in a 3rd-party app, but clearly shows that the iPad 2 is definitely faster.\n\nA: If you open the same PDF on an iPad 1 and an iPad 2 it is very likely to load faster on the newer one. This is true for all PDFs were meant for printing. PDF is capable of storing an enormous amount of weird stuff like javascript, flash (including ActionScript) and some drm. PDFs containing such items will most likely not load at all on both platforms (I want you to disagree in the comments), except for password protected PDFs.\n\nA: Since the iOS software is nearly identical between the two models, the hardware differences will be responsible for several differences. RAM and CPU are the main drivers in the case of PDF rendering and cacheing.\nOn the iPad 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Speed of the initial render of the PDF will be faster (CPU).\n\n*More PDF can be rendered and cached at screen resolution (RAM).\n\n*More background processes can stay ready (RAM).\n\n*Panning and zooming may be more responsive (RAM and CPU)\n\n\nHave a read and watch this TiPb video for an excellent demonstration.\nThis is one of the best side by side example I've seen to show the noticeable effects of more RAM and a faster CPU. Since they used Mobile Safari, it's more about RAM in this video, and a sufficiently complicated PDF might also show observable delays based on CPU speed differences.\n\nA: In addition to the answers that the iPad2 will be faster, which is undeniably true, it is important to keep in mind that the iPad2 is most likely still running the same PDF-reading software as the iPad1, since both run the same iOS. Any technical issues you may have run into—like objects not rendering properly—on the iPad1 will most likely be seen again on the iPad2 regardless of any speed benefits gained.\n", "Q: Garageband on 10.4.11: which version and where to find it? I'd love to install garageband on an old mac mini...\nWhich version will it run on 10.4.11?\nCan I download it from apple site or any other source?\n\nA: Garageband as included with iLife '08 will work fine with Tiger but you'll need to complete the free online upgrades to 10.4 to bring it up to date. \n", "Q: Can I install an App that is not available in my country's iTunes appstore? I want to download and install an app on my iPhone, that is available in the US iTunes App Store - but not in my country's iTunes App Store.\nIs that possible without creating a US iTunes account or jailbreaking my phone?\n\nA: A common way to work around the cross-border restrictions of the iTunes store is by using pre-paid iTunes cards. These are often available on eBay and you can redeem them in the iTunes store for the country of origin (assuming you want US items, you need to buy a pre-paid card from the US.)\n\nA: It is not possible.\nThe author of the app selects where the app will sell, and would not be available in other countries.\n\nA: It IS possible. I have done this. I can't imagine why an app developer wouldn't want everyone to buy their app.\nThis whole situation seems to be born out of some aspect of international distribution rights, it's archaic but can be legitimately navigated.\nThe way you have to do it is to change your iTunes billing information to use an account that is billed in a country where that app is \"available\". Then you'll be able to buy that content just fine and your existing content will function fine too. I operated this way for about a year. I had a friend open a bank account and I gave him money through paypal. He then let me use that account for iTunes access. I don't know of an easier way....\ncough\nThere are OTHER ways too, but I'm pretty sure such discourse is not permitted here. And actually, I haven't explored those as I fear big brother will have a temper tantrum.\n\nA: It's possible. I kept my SIM card issued by a US telco and have that in my iPhone when I need to download and install app from iTunes US AppStore. I switch back to my Lebanese telco issued SIM card to use my phone where I am now.\n\nA: Have you tried going to iTunes on a computer and just changing the store to the US App store? It's a long shot, but there is functionality to shop another countries store simply by clicking the flag at the bottom of your main iTunes store page. Scroll to the bottom and try switching to US.\nIf you wanted to switch permanently, see here for a self service solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I change the currency on the App Store?\n\nA: I live in Canada and use an alternate account for US only apps. My alternate account just has a fake address/zip code from the US, and as such, is tied to the US App Store instead of Canada's\nHowever, when updating apps it's necessary to enter passwords for both accounts, since both accounts might have apps to be updated.\n\nA: Use a VPN for either your phone or computer should work. Just my 2 cents\n", "Q: How to add space between each last body paragraph and heading in Pages '09? The only way I found is to manually add line breaks, which can lead to inconsistency. Is there a way to automate this ?\n\n\nA: Based on your question and comments to @nathang answer, you will need to create two paragraph styles. One will be the standard paragraph, and the second is a duplicate of the standard but with a value set in \"After Paragraph\" in the Inspector to use for paragraphs that come right before a header. \nUsing two paragraph styles is kludgy, but writing a script to automate this would be just as kludgy and unreliable.\n\nA: I am assuming that you are using paragraph styles. What you want to do is add space before one of the headings and then redefine the style to match the changes you have made.\nStep by step:\n\n*\n\n*Put the cursor in one of your headers. I suggest not the first one, because you won't notice what you are doing.\n\n\n*Show the inspector.\n\n\n*In the \"Text\" section of the inspector, give the appropriate \"Before Paragraph\" spacing.\n\n\n\n*Open the \"Styles Drawer\"\n\n\n*Click the triangle next to the style that you are using (e.g. Heading 1) and click \"Redefine Style from Selection.\"\n\n\n\n*Use the same heading style for all of your headings in the document.\n", "Q: Why do my iPad and iPhone send *two* notifications for every gmail I receive? Every time I get an email, I hear a ping and a vibration on my devices, followed by another about 3 seconds later.   \nI'm using gmail (through exchange) on both devices.  The only option I can find in settings is to turn 'new mail' notifications on or off.   I do not have other email accounts on the devices, so it's not auto-forwarding to two accounts or anything.\nI'd like to get a single ping and or vibration for each message.\n\nA: You get the notification sound with each push event that results in a new message to any mailbox.\nGoogle likes to send mail to All Mail as well as Inbox, so that is the likely cause of the two push events. You could make a temporary rule to skip the inbox for all messages and test to confirm this is the root cause.  The phone sees them as two messages, because they are in reality two messages arriving at different times to different mailboxes. I don't know a way to mark the All Mail always read, but perhaps the google filters are powerful enough to make this happen on your account.\nUntil (or if) google changes things to push them all at once, you can enable control over folders/tags in the labels settings. By controlling the Show in IMAP... status,  you should be able to avoid the second ding. \n\nYou could also try setting up rules to avoid any one message from hitting more than one folder as an unread message. iOS doesn't ding on sync of read messages, just syncs that change the unread count on a folder.\nLastly, iOS has changed behavior of the mobile mail app in the past to work better with Google mail. It's a common complaint, and could also be fixed with a change to mail on iOS.\n\nA: It happened on my iPhone 6s as well. To fix it, just turn off the sound notification from Settings > Mail > Notifications and select exchange account.\nYou are getting two notifications because one is coming from phone notifications and the second one comes from the app notifications (so just disable the mail notification for your exchange account)\n\nA: At first I thought it was iCloud's push. It is not! In your original iCloud set up it pushed the entire account so you have two of every email account.  Go to settings, email accounts and just delete the doubles.  That's it that's all. \n", "Q: Time Machine not starting when I connect the HDD I have a 500 GB WD My Passport with two partitions on it, one of which is set as a Time Machine backup drive. The problem is that the backup doesn't start automatically when I connect the HDD. Any idea why?\nIf it helps, the only thing I did was to partition it, I haven't formatted it, so the SmartWare drive kicks in every time I connect it.\nEnvironment: Last generation MacBook Pro; Mac OS X 10.6.8.\n\nA: (Edit: Lion makes this less of an issue with local snapshots possible as well as the ability to script the starting with tmutil startbackup - the rest of this answer is in regards to Snow Leopard implementation of TimeMachine)\nTime Machine sets a timer based on when the mac is booted, so it's very unlikely the system looks to start a backup when the device is attached.\nInstead, it is designed to commence a backup periodically and will log messages and skip a backup if there is a problem or the drive isn't attached. Once one or more backups gets skipped, perhaps it might start one sooner when the volume it expects is attached. I just checked on one mac that backs up to a local disk. When I log out all users, it doesn't see the disk at attached, so it skips each back up. When I log back in, that user log in mounts the disk and Time Machine started a backup immediately rather than waiting the \"rest of the hour\" for the backup.\nThis is how it is supposed to work.\nI would initiate a backup using the control panel or the menu item to be sure there isn't an error condition - but once you rule that out, it's just a matter of time until the hour passes and your backup will start.\nHave you made sure there isn't some other issue by checking in the console app? Also, do you let this mac sleep, or will it stay running for several hours and still skip a backup when the drive is connected?\n", "Q: How do I start TextEditor from the command line? I work a lot at the command line in a Terminal and would like to start a text editor on a certain file. I'm from Linux Land and normally use kwrite or gedit from a bash shell.  Trying to find the Mac equivalent, as a guess, tried \nuser> textedit somefile.txt\n\nand\nuser> texteditor somefile.txt\n\nand\nuser> TextEditor somefile.txt\n\nand other variations.  I can't seem to find the proper name of the text editor app. (No, vi isn't to my liking.)  Oddly, the guy at an Apple store didn't know this.   \n\nA: If you search for a comfortable way with more \"linux feel\"\nadd something like the following to your ~/.profile:\nalias textmate='open -a TextMate'\n\nor\nalias textedit='open -a TextEdit'\n\ndepending on your editors.\n\nA: If you already started to write in terminal and you want to continue on your favorite editor you can press ctrl+X, ctrl+E and continue working in emacs or your default bash editor. \nIf you want to change the default editor, change the environment variable EDITOR to your favorite one:\nEDITOR=vim;export EDITOR\n\n\nA: The default text editor is TextEdit. You can open a text file in there by using open -a:\n$ open -a TextEdit hi.txt\n\nIf you want to use another app, just put it's name in, like this:\n$ open -a Coda index.html\n\n\nA: Here are some possible answers, all using the 'open' command-line utility.\nThe -a option means \"open the file argument with the named application\":\nopen -a TextEdit file.txt\nThe -e option means \"open the file argument with the TextEdit application\":\nopen -e file.txt\nThe -t option means \"open the file with the default application for editing text files, as determined via LaunchServices\". By default, this will be /Applications/TextEdit.app; however, it's possible for this setting to get overridden:\nopen -t file.txt\nFinally, any file that's of the \"text\" type will get opened by the application bound to the text type if you just say open file.txt. You can use the \"file\" command to reveal what the operating system thinks the file type is: file file.txt. So, for example, if you renamed \"file.txt\" to just \"textfile\" then open textfile would still open it in the default text-file editing application, as long as file textfile still thought that \"textfile\" was actually a text file.\nA short 'help' file on open can be found by running\nopen --help\n\nOr you can read the whole manual with\nman open\n\n\nA: There are two ways:\nIf your default text editor is TextEdit, you can simply use\nopen -t file.txt\n\nto open it in TextEditor.\nIf your default text editor is not TextEdit, and you want to open it in TextEdit specifically, you can use\n/Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit file.txt\n\nEither of those can be made an alias in your shell config file, of course.\n\nA: 1) Quick open textEdit content edit interface, note that the generated files are stored in the /tmp directory:\n#Input content + Enter + Ctrl+D\nopen -f\n\n#open empty tempfile\necho|open -f\n\n#alias\nalias txted='echo|open -f'\ntxted\n\n2) Prefer to take standard input and output it to TextEdit\necho \"input something\"|open -f\ncat Dockerfile|open -f\n\n3) Just open a TextEdit:\nopen -e\n\nFrom man open: \n-e  Opens with TextEdit. \n-f  Reads input from standard input and opens with TextEdit.\n\n\nA: See if you have the vim editor, I didn't even realize my terminal could use it. \nTry:\nuser> vimtutor \n\nto figure out its controls. \nYou can edit files pretty well with it. The syntax looks something like:\nuser> vim foo.txt\n\n\nA: TextWrangler (now defunct and replaced with BBEdit) when installed with the Command Line Utilities, allowed you to do:\nedit README.txt\n\nto launch TextWrangler, which to me is nicer than open -t README.txt, but maybe I'm just suffering from inertia.\nFYI - edit is a binary executable file (from the TextWrangler kit), not just an alias or symlink.\n\nA: Since you want to open \"a\" text editor. It shouldn't be wrong if you use a command line text editor such as vim or vi. Just type \nuser> vim filename\nLooking at the other answers this might seem controversial. But as you work mostly inside the the terminal. Using vim or Gedit is the ideal choice.\n\nA: Use gedit command:\ngedit your-file.ext\n\n", "Q: Unable to login to MacBook, worked fine with Active Directory account on corp. network My IT dept setup my new MacBook Pro with 2 accounts. One is a local account and the other is on the Active Directory server. Both have administrative privileges on the mac.\nI've been using the AD account to setup apps while on the corporate network (wired and/or wi-fi). My standard 'shutdown' procedure is simply to close the lid. There's a setting that will prompt for password after 15 minutes, so I can close it, walk to a conference room, open it and start typing w/o password, whereas if I unplug and lock it in the desk drawer for the night, I'll need to type a password after flipping it open.\nToday, for the first time, I opened it while NOT on the corporate network. Many miles away from it, infact. I had closed it while using my AD account, so I typed in those credentials--and was denied. I tried again, one careful keypress at a time, verified caps lock off, etc. and still I was told invalid username or password.\nSo I tried the local account credentials. Those also failed.\nHow do I get back into my Mac?\n\nA: You might be out of luck. Sounds like the AD authentication isn't caching your credentials locally so you can login when you're away from your AD server.\nYou can go brute force on the problem:\nHold down the power button your MacBook Pro for ~5 seconds until the machine shuts itself off. Power it back on and use your local credentials to log in instead of your AD credentials.\nOnce you're back up and running run /System/Library/CoreServices/Directory Utility. Click the lock icon to unlock the settings. Highlight Active Directory in the list and click the pen icon to edit the settings. In the window that pops up click the Show Advanced Options and make sure that Create mobile account at login is checked. This ensures you can login when the AD server isn't present.\n", "Q: Is it possible to determine the model of an iOS device by its MAC address? I'm starting to work on iOS apps at work, and I'm trying to determine the minimum version of iOS I'll need to support. We have a network registration system that gathers some basic information about devices on the network, but unfortunately, it doesn't report the version of the operating system or hardware.\nI do, however, have MAC addresses for every iOS device used on our network in the past 12 months.\nIs there a way to determine, based on a MAC address, what generation an iOS device is? If Apple used sequential addresses (or reserved specific blocks for specific devices), this should be possible.\n\nI'll leave the above question (because I'm still curious if there's a way to do this), but I found another way to determine the hardware we have in use. Exchange server keeps track of devices each user syncs their email to. Assuming most iOS users sync their email accounts, I was able to use that information to determine what devices are in use. It turns out that about 20% of them are using devices that won't run iOS 5.\n\nA: No - it's not a good way to get that data.\nI would have a look at some of the many MDM software packages to get your population data so you can plan. JAMF has a great reputation in that space for low cost of entry and high performing software.\nAlso - you could make a quick little app that simply reported in some basic stats. Your users will be clamoring for potential apps and those willing to run that app will feed you with the data needed.\nYou will find that making the app forces you to restrict many of the new features and in reality - you'll have to actively work to get 3.x support in a project you start today using the current Xcode 4. 4.0 will be easy and only the new 5.0 features will get you into having to test the levels and have two sets of code for different generations of device. \nYour development will drive what devices people use and not the other way around. It's almost always cheaper to just upgrade devices than pay developers to keep the older code tested and running.\nThere are lots of great charts out showing what some devs are seeing for how fast people upgrade to the latest iOS versions.\n", "Q: Why does my iPod Touch automatically turn the volume all the way down? I have an 8GB iPod Touch, 4th generation.  Recently it has been automatically turning the volume all the way down, and it often won't let me turn it back up again.  This happens both when I'm using headphones and when I'm not.  It has also been restarting itself automatically.  It hasn't always done this--I've had it since December 2010, and it started doing it in May 2011.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: Three things can cause this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The down button is now physically pressed (or the electrical contact has shorted/failed)\n\n*The headphone jack is sensing a volume button press (much less likely)\n\n*software is corrupt (very very unlikely, but still possible)\n\n*bluetooth remote (also very very unlikely)\n\n\nYou can restore the device to rule out #3. Turning off bluetooth nixes #4. You might be able to rule out #2 by trying some different headphones, but I've seen that fail in ways that headphones in or out won't help. You'll need a repair / exchange to fix the first two issues if it's not caused by a temporary piece of debris or light cleaning with clean, dry lightly compressed air.\n\nA: I have the exact same problem with my iPod. I've found a temporary but helpful fix is to physically depress the down volume button with quite a bit of pressure a few times. If the volume button is stuck, depressing it a few times seems to jolt it loose.\n\nA: I fixed this by just doing a reset on all settings, no need to erase data.  Was sticking on no volume\n\nA: Try a squirt of WD-40 in the volume down button. Worked for me.\n", "Q: Time Capsule network, Windows machine on different subnet? I just received a Time Capsule for my birthday last week.  I installed it, everything went fine and I was loving it.  I transferred files from my 2 Macs and my 1 Dell and all was rosy.\nThen the weekend past and today I tried to access the Time Capsule from Explorer on my Dell (running Windows 7) and it doesn't see it anymore.  I tried using the \"Airport Base Station Agent\" and when I connect through that or try to Map a Network Drive I get an error saying that \"NAME OF TIME CAPSULE\" cannot be found, check the spelling and try again.  \nIn doing some digging, I discovered that my Macs are on the IP Subnet 172.16.8.xxx and my Windows machine is on 192.168.216.xxx.  And the Subnet Mask for the Time Capsule network is 255.255.252.0 (notice the 2nd to last is 252, NOT 255) while the Windows machine is on 255.255.255.0.  \nActually, when I run ipconfig the Windows Machine is even more confusing than that.  The settings I listed are for the \"Ethernet Adapter Local Area Connection 2\" but there is also a \"Wireless LAN Adapter Wireless Network Connection\" which is on 255.255.252.0 with an IP of 12.9.104.xxx \nTo make it even stranger, I have VirtualBox running on the Windows machine running a Ubuntu server.  The Ubuntu machine is set up to grab its own IP using DHCP from the network and not use the Host Machine IP.  The Ubuntu VM running on the Dell has the same IP range as the Macs and the Time Capsule.  \nI have some ok experience with networking, though not a ton going between OS X and Windows (I usually use DropBox for file transfers).  \nSummary:\n1 Time Capsule.\n2 Macs connect to Time Capsule fine.\n1 Windows 7 Dell connects to Time Capsule Network, but on different IP range and cannot see anything else on the network.\n1 Ubuntu VM running on the Dell connects to Time Capsule network on same IP range as Macs and can connect to Macs correctly.  \nEdit\nI forgot the strangest part (as if the VM thing wasn't weird enough).\nWhen I use the \"Airport Utility\" from Windows (which was used to set up the Time Capsule initially) it sees and connects to the Time Capsule fine on IP 172.16.8.xxx, but when I PING that IP...no dice.  It times out every single time.\nWhat in the world do I do?\n\nA: If your Dell running Windows 7 is connected via ethernet or WiFi directly to the Time Capsule, then it sure should be able to ping. Perhaps a firewall is blocking those packets? Also - you might want to manually assign a 172.16.x.x address to be sure it's not a routing issue.\nAirport Utility uses IPv6 when it can as well as Bonjour (mdns) so it will find attached units more aggressively than ping. Also, I've connected to Time Capsule from PC across the internet, so it's not something that has to be on the same subnet - just that the networks have to be working correctly.\nIn your case, 255.255.252.0 isn't a wide enough netmask to unify 172.16.x.x with 192.168.x.x. However, shares work over the internet, so it's really a routing issue and not something necessarily wrong with a netmask. Can you at least get all the machines on the same subnet?\nMobile Me also solves this problem for mac users but I doubt that's something you can sign up for during the transition to iCloud (and it would merely work around your network issues, not solve them). \n", "Q: How to run a nightly backup job on Snow Leopard Server via launchd I have been trying to configure a nightly backup job on my Mac Mini server, and after a lot of Googling and digging and man-page'ing, I figured out that launchd seemed to be the correct too, and tried setting up my own plist fil. I've come up with this (stored in /Library/LaunchDaemons/dk.revealit.NightlyRSyncBackup.plist):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>dk.revealit.NightlyRSyncBackup</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n                <string>/var/root/run-rsync</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>LowPriorityIO</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>Nice</key>\n        <integer>1</integer>\n        <key>WorkingDirectory</key>\n        <string>/var/root</string>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <false/>\n        <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n        <dict>\n                <key>Hour</key>\n                <integer>3</integer>\n                <key>Minute</key>\n                <integer>15</integer>\n        </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nProblem is, it doesn't work. I can load it with launchctl, and it appears on launchctl list with exit status 0. But if I check my backup files, they are not updated.\nAny clues as to what I'm doing wrong (assuming my backup script works as it should)?\n\nA: Several things come to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Did you wait overnight for it to run?  launchctl load won't make it run out of sequence -- if you want to make it run at some time other than 3:15 am, use sudo launchctl start dk.revealit.NightlyRSyncBackup after it's loaded.\n\n*Does the run-rsync script fire off any background processes, or does it do everything inline?  'Cause if the script exits and there are background processes still going, launchd thinks something has gone wrong and kills the background processes.  If you don't want it to do this, add <key>AbandonProcessGroup</key><true/> to the .plist.\n\n*Does the script depend on PATH including any nonstandard directories (e.g. /opt/local/bin or something like that)?\nOne useful debugging technique is to add something like:\n<key>StandardOutPath</key>\n<string>/var/root/NightlyRSyncBackup.out</string>\n<key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n<string>/var/root/NightlyRSyncBackup.err</string>\n\nto the .plist and see what shows up in those files.\n\nA: Once answered a similiar qst, so check this first:\nfrom the man lanuchctl\n\nNote that per-user configuration files\n  (LaunchAgents) must be owned by the\n  user loading them.

I would like to know if every YouTube video is playable on iPad2.\nFurther does iPad2 play .avi or .mp3 or .flv videos ?\nFor example can an iPad2 play these videos - \n\n\n*\n\n*http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/qcdscat11/arkanihamed/\n\n*http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ3M3tp0GJE\nA list to give a flavour of the kind of videos I watch and hence will hope to watch on my iPad.\nIf iPad can't play these then is there an app which makes it possible ? \n\nA: \nI would like to know if every YouTube video is playable on iPad2.\n\nNo, not every single video but most YouTube videos are playable on iOS devices. It is not easy to determine which videos are playable other than just trying to play them. There are a few reasons why YouTube videos may not be playable: old videos may have not been converted to H.264 (remember before the iPhone, YouTube was all Flash) or the owner of the video may not want it to be viewed on mobile devices or embedded in websites.\n\nFurther does iPad2 play .avi or .mp3 or .flv videos ?\n\nKind of. It will handle mp3 and PCM stereo audio in .avi, but not flv.\n\nFor example can an iPad2 play these videos -\nhttp://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/qcdscat11/arkanihamed/\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ3M3tp0GJE\n\nI can confirm the YouTube video you linked to works fine. The other link has a bunch of different formats but most of them are not playable. The flash links will not work. Usually mov links will work but these don't look like they are H.264 and do not work. Usually 3gp works as well but I could only open it in OPlayer.\n\nIf iPad can't play these then is there an app which makes it possible?\n\nOPlayer doesn't work for every codec, but it does bridge the gap sometimes. And it has a free lite version so it is worth the download.\nI think you should take a look at the official audio and video formats supported by the iPad 2:\n\nVideo mirroring and video out support:\nUp to 1080p with Apple Digital AV\nAdapter or Apple VGA Adapter (cables\nsold separately) Video out support at\n576p and 480p with Apple Component AV\nCable; 576i and 480i with Apple\nComposite AV Cable Video formats\nsupported: H.264 video up to 720p, 30\nframes per second, Main Profile level\n3.1 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and\n.mov file formats; MPEG-4 video, up to\n2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-LC\naudio up to 160 Kbps per channel,\n48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and\n.mov file formats; Motion JPEG\n(M-JPEG) up to 35 Mbps, 1280 by 720\npixels, 30 frames per second, audio in\nulaw, PCM stereo audio in .avi file\nformat\n\n\nA: There is a native youtube app for iPad (and other Apple devices) that will play the videos just fine. As for the link you sent, the Flash videos are not supported. The .mov files are not directly supported either but you could download them to your computer then transfer them to the iPad via iTunes. The podcast can be opened in Safari and viewed just fine.\n\nA: There was an app called VLC that let you play a wide variety of video files. However it was foolproof (it failed to play some files I tried) and it is no longer available.\nThe best option I have found is an app called Air Video. It works injunction with software that runs on a Mac or Windows PC.\nThe Mac/PC software converts the video into a format that the iPad can play and the Air Video app streams the video from the Mac/PC. It also has an option for pushing the converted video into iTunes to sync onto the iPad.\nI've yet to find a video that Air Video can't play.\n\nA: As you can see from the many other answers, you can't play avi and flv files and in general not all YouTube videos are allowed or even converted to html5/quicktime formats for viewing on the iPad/iOS devices.\nThere is a new tool from google called swiffy that allows you to upload and convert files from flv to html5. It's not complete and supports a subset of flash commands, but there is recognition that tools like this are needed and commercially valuable. Adobe also is expanding it's professional CS tools to assist in converting / authoring flash to html5.\n", "Q: Mac Pro: Splitting network traffic based on destination I have a Mac Pro tower with two ethernet ports. One of them is connected to the company intranet and the other to my home network. I'd like my Mac to use the former ethernet connection only for those services within the intranet; for everything else I'd like to use the latter connection (e.g. the web).\nGiven that the intranet addresses will fall into a specific range, how can this be done?\nUpdate\nThanks to some huge help from bmike I've been making some progress but am still not quite there yet. Here is my original routing table (with some details omitted) showing the two default paths leading out of either Ethernet port:\ndefault    A.B.C.D    UGSc           17        0     en0\ndefault    E.F.G.H    UGScI          12        0     en1\n\nThe first entry is to the company network via Ethernet 1 (en0); the second to my home network via Ethernet 2 (en1).\nThe goal is to force all traffic not destined for a location within the company to route through Ethernet 2. My understanding thus far has led me to modify the routing tables as such:\nsudo /sbin/route -n delete default A.B.C.D\nsudo /sbin/route -n add -net A A.B.C.D\n\nGiving me the following modified table:\ndefault    E.F.G.H     UGScI          1        0     en1\nA          A.B.C.D     UGSc          28        0     en0\n\nThe end result is not quite what I'd expect, however. I am still able to access all sites on the company intranet however all traffic to e.g., stackoverflow.com or anywhere else other than the intranet fails. A sampling from ping confirms this:\nFooBar:~ username$ ping latimes.com\nPING latimes.com (144.142.224.43): 56 data bytes\nping: sendto: No route to host\n\nIs the default entry above not sufficient for that purpose, or am I missing something?\nUpdate 2\nApparently adding the following got things working as I'd expect:\nsudo /sbin/route -n add default E.F.G.H\n\nResulting in the following table:\ndefault            E.F.G.H     UGSc            0        0     en1\ndefault            E.F.G.H     UGScI          25        0     en1\nA                  A.B.C.D     UGSc            2        0     en0\n\nBut I don't understand why the original default entry didn't suffice? The documentation for the I flag reads:\nI       RTF_IFSCOPE      Route is associated with an interface scope\n\nSo how does that default entry's I status prevent its use for my stated goal?

I transcoded a DVD into several m4v files with HandBrake. How can I merge these files into one m4v movie?\n\nA: You can use the built-in iMovie app to do this.\nCreate a new project, add your video files, and drag them to the timeline in order. Export your project as an M4V (Share-> Export Movie).\nIf you're completely new to iMovie, some good introductory tutorials can be found on YouTube.\n\nA: Join can use MP4Box.\nOn the shell:\nMP4Box $(for file in single*m4v; do echo -cat $file; done) joined.m4v\n\nRelated: https://superuser.com/a/364159/95878\n\nA: With iMovie (Yosemite) I merged 3 videos made on my iPhone 6s, piece of cake.\nin Projects (tab) click +\nSelect Movie, no theme\nImport Media (I had my 3 videos on desktop, Cmd-Click selected all 3 at same time)\nImport Selected (presto, imported)\nClick on one of the videos then Cmd-a for selecting all 3.\nClick Hold-Drag all 3 down to timeline.\nFile, Share\nIf you click on Share, Email you will get 5 choices of sizes to save the video, it will then open an email and place the video in the email.

(...files created using ResEdit.)\n\nA: Rezycle might work for you. Let us know.\n\nA: On OSX you can access the raw resource fork of a file like this:\ncp resource_file/..namedfork/rsrc  resource_fork\n\nThere's also the system utilities DeRez/Rez (available in OSX 10.7 and as mention by @marc as part of Xcode tools on newer MacOS versions) which allows for extraction of resource fork data into a form for use by the Rez resource compiler  - e.g. extract icon data from an Icon file:\nDeRez -only icns Icon^M > icon\n\nIt should be noted that the resulting files from both of the above commands require additional processing to convert the resources to a suitable form.\nSee related question on Icon files.\n\nA: Abet slightly unstable, the resource editor Rezilla runs under 10.7.4.\n", "Q: Combining users on OSX 10.6.8 I just bought a new mac and when migrating my old to my new mac, I accidentally put it in a different user. Is there a way, I can combine both users?\n\nA: There's no way to combine user accounts. If one of the accounts is empty the best option is to delete it. Otherwise, move everything you want from one account's home folder to another and then get rid of the old one. \n", "Q: Is it possible to be always connected to a VPN without prompting for credentials? Is it possible to install a configuration profile on an iOS Device that will always have the user connected to VPN without prompting for username/password each time trying to connect?\nIn other words, our current setup has users connecting to a VPN via the \"Settings\" App on the iPad (using IPSec).  With this setup, our users are prompted for their password each time they try to connect to the VPN.\nWe are trying to avoid prompting for credentials and having our users go to the Settings app in the first place, so is there any way to force a VPN connection, and therefore always stay connected via the iPhone Configuration Utility?\n\nA: You can configure the VPN setting on your ipad, iphone or ipod touch to save the User Name and Password for VPN. I don't know of a way to have it constantly connect the VPN whenever the is a connection. Given the time it takes to establish a VPN handshake, it would be kind of frustrating to wake the device then not be able to connect to any internet/network related Apps for 15+ seconds while it connects to the VPN. \nChoose Settings > General > Network > VPN > then choose the VPN Configuration. Fill in in the username a password section and then you can just turn the VPN on when you need it and not have to fill out the User Name and Password.\nmore info:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1424\nAlternative you could look at something like Apple's Mobile Access server, to give you that secured VPN like connection all the time without the hassle of starting a VPN connection:\nhttp://www.apple.com/server/macosx/features/mobile-access.html\n\nA: If you’re using the IPSec VPN client in iOS, and connecting to a Cisco ASA for VPN, it’s a configuration option on the ASA whether to allow the password to be saved in the iOS VPN client.  By default, it does NOT allow password storage on the remote iOS client, so you need to enter the password each time.  I am an admin on my own personal ASA so I can set that option, even for specific users or groups.  But if you don’t administer the ASA, or if corporate policy does not allow password storage, then you’ll need to enter it manually each time you connect the VPN.\n\nA: You can configure your server to only accept a certificate which you add to your iPad(s). That way, the user won't have to to anything special, he/she just attempts to make the connection (let's say check their email) and the connection will be made over SSL, using the certificate present on the ipad.\n", "Q: How to dim (and un-dim) display in automator For those that are interested in the final script you can get it here\noriginal question\n\nI am trying to make a alarmclock script to wake me up. but I can't figure out how to change the screen brightness in automator.\nI found a way to control brightness with the commandline. but I can't get it to work in automator\n\nI'm the original author of the code listed in this hint. I originally wrote it for two reasons: first, to adjust brightness automatically by location on my iBook G4, which had no ambient light sensor, and second, so I could have my laptop turn on the backlight when a long operation finished, providing a quiet form of notification I could use while at a seminar.\n  http://sabi.net/nriley/software/brightness.zip is 4-way universal, 10.5+.

You can download it, and find install directions, here.\nAnother option: You can run an AppleScript from your Automator workflow to press the brightness up/down keys. Up:\ntell application \"System Events\" to key code 107\n\nDown:\ntell application \"System Events\" to key code 113\n\nNote: you may have to Enable Access for Assistive Devices for the AppleScript to work.\n\nA: Where did you install the “brightness” command? Even if you've set up your PATH in the shell rc scripts, it may not take effect for these commands because Automator isn't run from a shell. (You can set environment for all programs including GUI using ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist, but I wouldn't recommend fiddling with PATH just for this.)\nI suggest changing your Automator workflow to use the full path to where it's installed, e.g.\n/usr/local/bin/brightness 1\n\n\nA: Try having the automator run this AppleScript. It works for me!\nset brightness_level to 1.0\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application \"System Preferences\" to reveal the anchor \"displaysDisplayTab\" of pane named \"Displays\"\n    tell slider 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 of window 1 of process \"System Preferences\"\n        set value to brightness_level\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How to indent a Table in a List in iWork Pages 09? I want insert a Table in a List, but couldn't figure out how to indent the Table to the rest of the content in the List. The Table keeps stretching across the width of the document.

Select the rightest case where you get adjustment to the right. Now go back to your table and drag the edge from the left side to suit your text indent. \n", "Q: Any way to view Microsoft Publisher files in Mac OS X I'm trying to view a MS Publisher file without running a Windows virtual machine. Any way to do that? It's ok if it doesn't render 100% accurately.\n\nA: Another vote for Crossover/Wine. Not sure how well Publisher runs personally, but I know that the rest of Office 2003 (if that's the version that you're using) works perfectly (and that's using the free version they gave out a couple of years ago, I imagine it's only gotten better since).\n\nA: If your idea is only to READ and never to edit, I would suggest that you convert the file into PDF format using any of the thousands free converters out there, for example:\n\nhttp://www.publishertopdf.com/\n\nSo you don't need a license of Microsoft Publisher neither CrossOver.\n\nA: Another vote for converting first.

(about $430) I'm planning on buying a new macbook pro 13inch and I've got the choice between a 2.3ghz intel core i5 or an 2.7ghz intel core i7 for an extra €300 (= $430). \nCan someone explain me what the difference is between i5 and i7? Would it be worth it to updgrade (eg will the performance be better)? \nI would mainly use the laptop for matlab simulations (and other simple 3D simulations) and data processing. Some of these calculation are highly recursive and take a long time (fractal computation etc) on my current machine.\n\nA: The two processors in question are the i5-2415M and the i7-2620M. The nitty-gritty tech-spec details can be compared here.\nThe main difference, besides clock speed, is that the i7 has a bigger cache and includes Intel vPro Technology which theoretically provides faster AES decryption and other magical buzzwords.\nOf course, what you really want are benchmarks, and then decide if the 3 seconds you save on a one minute photoshop action is worth three hundred Euros.\n\nA: The speed differences aren't very important -- the big difference is that the i7 had Intel VT-D technology, which improves VM IO performance, especially if you use multiple VMs simultaneously.\nIf you see alot of work with VMs in your future and have the money, go for it. Otherwise, the i5 is more than adequate.\nThe i7 also has hardware AES acceleration.\n\nA: There is no simple answer. IMHO, the question is not about 0.4 GHz.

I know that since 2009 Apple has been advertising the 1000 battery cycles that'll last for around 5 years under normal use for Macbooks and Macbook Pros. I don't see them advertising it in the new Macbook Air, is it the case that they have the same long lasting battery or not?\n\nA: Yes their design limit is to exceed 1,000 full charge cycles. Quoting from Apple on batteries:\n\nThe built-in battery of your MacBook,\nMacBook Pro or MacBook Air is designed\nto deliver up to 1000 full charge and\ndischarge cycles before it reaches 80\npercent of its original capacity.\n\nI have been bowled over at how well the internal battery chemistry holds up over time.

However, it sometimes asks for it much earlier, after just a few minutes of inactivity. This also happens when waking the Mac up from (a short) sleep, but when that happens, the screen usually stays completely dark: I know it's actually asking for my password because if I enter it, the screen \"unlocks\" and starts working normally; if I press Esc instead, the computer stops again (and works normally if I wake it up again).\nThis appears to be a random behavior that I cannot reproduce at will. It happens quite often after a stop, but only rarely otherwise (i.e. without sleeping).\nDoes anybody have a clue about what could be going on?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Security and Privacy > General and disable Require Password.\n", "Q: How can I prevent iPhoto from opening everytime I plug my iPad/iPhone? How can I prevent iPhoto/Photos/Image Capture from launching everytime I plug in my iPad/iPhone?\n\nA: The way disable this in bulk using terminal or a script:\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ImageCapture disableHotPlug -bool YES\n\nThis sets a flag to tell the system to not activate ImageCapture or Photos or iPhoto when a hot plug of an iOS device is detected.

All of its files are located in ~/Library/Mail where '~' is your home folder. In there each account that you have has a folder and then you can flip through all of your inboxes and drag certain messages out into another folder  if you want to make sure they'll stay where you know where they are.

I wiped the disk clean and inserted it totally fresh into the mac. I installed Mac OS X from my original installation dvd and just proceeded as usual with that. In the installation procedure I was asked to copy stuff from an old mac and I chose the alternative to copy from another volume on the mac. Since I've got this kit to plug in any internal drive as a usb-drive I just plugged in the original still unscathed disk where everything was like I left it after I copied it. This restored all the programs and what not and they worked as usual after this procedure. \nI convinced myself to just start over with a fresh bootcamp installation and bring over whatever I need from the old disk when I need it. Not the best solution but it can be good to know that the mac's function to \"restore\" from an old mac actually repaired what was broken. My mac os is exactly like I left it on the other disk. \nSince the days of XP, I'm pretty used to starting fresh with windows so I'm actually looking forward to it a little bit..\n", "Q: Make a screen-shot and upload with a script I am not very good with AppleScript but I would imagine this is something quite easy for the AppleScript guru out there, I am looking to make a screenshot of a region like with doing Apple-Shift-s and feed it the ScreenShot filename to a shell script which would take care of the upload.\nThanks.\nPS: I don't need the shell script part just the AppleScript one.\n\nA: simply run shell command:\nscreencapture -i filename\n\nthis will start screencapture in interactive mode (selecting region).

As I know iPad 3G can define user's location using A-GPS module, and there is a Maps application which is closely related to this functionality.\nBut can non-3G iPads define user's location basing on WiFi routers position, for example? Is there any Maps application?\n\nA: Yes, as is now disclosed in the location database kerfuffle, iOS will cache wifi and cell tower location near it's location so that when internet access is temporarily unavailable, the device can still trilaterate based on what the WiFi receiver is seeing for SSID.\nSo, I have had my non 3G iPad correctly locate itself driving down the highway 50 miles from where it last had a WiFi connection. If I have purchased any map product that stores it's own map tiles, it would work. Even the built in map program caches tiles, so I would generate driving directions and step through all the turns to download the map tiles along the way on the device. As long as the device doesn't quit that app / purge those downloaded tiles, the built in map works well for me without 3G data.\nOf course, you don't have actual control over downloading a region of tiles or controlling which wifi hotspots are downloaded into the system cache. Also - this means if you are outside the range of any WiFi signal (or the ones that are nearby are not mapped in the database) - your device is clueless at to it's location.\nBasically, the hardware limits the ability to use GPS and cellular data and maps are not further handicapped just because a non-3G iPad has less connectivity. Pick the app you like and see how it works in your enviroment. You can always add external GPS input if you can't sell and re-buy a new iPad for less than the cost of an external receiver.\n\nA: Just like on iPod touches that are also wifi-only with no GPS, non-3G iPads have the built-in Apple Maps application and use wifi to detect location.\n", "Q: Network interfaces missing after software update [iMac 7,2] I recently updated my iMac to Mac OS X 10.6.8, it took a while to come back up, and when it did start up, the network interfaces were missing and when trying to open the Network tab in system preferences, the program just crashes...\nAny idea? I'm desperate...\n\nA: Download the 10.6.8 combo update on another machine and copy it to a thumb drive to run on the machine that's down.\nIf that fails, I would open a ticket with Apple and let them solve the issue.  There's a fee but it gives you the best way to get the best help.\n", "Q: Is there a way to cancel or disable the slow dock transition easter eggs? If you shift-click the minimize button or hold shift while restoring a window, you get the slow-motion genie or scale effect.\nIs there a way to resume full speed after an accidental shift-click?\nIs there a way to disable the shift-click combination so that the transition always runs at full speed?\n\nA: There is a way!\nOpen Terminal.app\nThen, type this and type the following:   \ndefaults write com.apple.finder FXEnableSlowAnimation -bool false\n\nTo make it go on again, just change the false to true.\nEdit: \nIt seems that there is no way to disable the Slow Animation special effects on shift-click. \n", "Q: Is it safe to edit App Bundles in Core Services? There is a default preference I want to edit (or delete and recreate in the English.lproj) in the Dock bundle in System/Library/CoreServices.  \nWhat are the possible negative repercussions to editing these app bundles?\n\nA: What's the worst that can happen?\n1) You break something and have to safe boot or target mode boot to put the original file back in place? You have to have a short term plan to fix things.\n2) You forget you edited it and some system update or process changes and the mac crashes later? No worry if you have backups (running Time Machine keeps you an hour or so of lost work plus whatever time you lose realizing, fixing and restoring from the last backup) You might lose some time scratching your head later, but even though it could ruin other data, it probably would just be a crash or an error that would be obviously wrong and you'll eventually remember the change you made.\nProtect yourself, get a second boot drive ready, and have at it would be my advice.\n\nA: I've had my Dock.app modified since the launch of Leopard to customize the dock's appearance, with no downsides. I've reapplied the same hack to Snow Leopard, and now Lion.\nI'm just replacing a few .PNGs, but my experience has been that it's really not a big deal.\n", "Q: organising apps by multiple levels of folders possible? I like the idea of putting our apps in \"folders\" , but is there anyway we can furthur put those \"folders\" into \"folders\" ?\n\nA: Not at this time. You cannot make a folder within a folder in iOS.\n\nA: As a substitute, maybe use the pages of apps on the iphone.\n", "Q: What is the correct way to prevent MacBook Pro (mid-2010) from sleeping on lid close? I have MacBook Pro 13\" mid-2010 (MacBookPro7,1), and sometimes I need it to work with the lid closed (long compilations, etc. while I'm on the go). I have tried InsomniaX, but it has no effect. I enable it via the menu bar icon and it displays \"enabled\", but, if I close the lid, my notebook will go to sleep in a dozen seconds or so. Any way I can prevent this? I know about the heat issue; it doesn't bother me.\n\nA: In order to work with Lion, InsomaniaX has been updated to version 2.0.\n\nA: I assume by \"long compilations while I'm on the go\" you mean something like \"start a compile, stick laptop in backpack, remove at destination\". Otherwise, I'd suggest just turning the screen off or locking it and leaving the clamshell open. \nWhen you close the clamshell, the laptop will always go to sleep - the command to do so is at a deeper level than applications run at. (The no-sleep app I like, Jiggler, wiggles the mouse periodically to prevent sleep, but closing the lid will send the laptop to sleep anyway.) \nYour best bet is to probably put the computer to sleep then wake it up when the screen is closed with a mouse or keyboard so it can continue to compile. (I've also seen people use a thin sheet of metal to hit the power button to wake the computer, but I've no experience with that.)\n\nA: Have you considered trying InsomniaX alternatives like Sleepless?\n(It's well maintained and has Lion support)\n\nA: I just connect a USB keyboard and display adapter when I need it to keep running in clamshell mode. \n", "Q: change filesize of iPhoto image before adding it to a mail How can I change the filesize (resolution and compression) of an image from iPhoto before adding it as an embedded image in apple mail without actually changing the image in iPhoto?\n\nA: If you click the email button in either Aperture or iPhoto, or for any photo you drag into Mail, you'll find a drop-down at the bottom of the window once you select an image that allows you to change the size of the image, and it tells you the size of the resulting file.\nSmall, Medium, Large, and Original are the options.\nAs I said, this works for any image in Mail. It won't affect the originals in any way. It's the easiest way I've found to change the images, and it tells you the results on the fly, so you can adjust each image as required.\n\nA: It's working for me on Lion (but didn't for a while on Snow Leopard)\nWhen attaching a photo from the Media Browser - you can change things in the lower right corner of the mail message.\n \nA similar dialog is drawn when you \"share\" from iPhoto to mail before it hands off the pictures and creates a blank mail message.\n\nSince the latest iPhoto can \"mail\" the images directly - might you be using that feature instead? If so - look in the bottom right when composing and you can change the setting before sending (as well as choose from the many templates above the size setting menu.)\n \nI think there was a bug where running the ready-for-Lion version of iPhoto on Snow Leopard skipped this dialog - but I don't have that setup to test at the moment. Perhaps I just missed the new location of the pop up when mailing them from iPhoto directly.\n\nA: iPhoto 11 has exactly the same options if you email via Mail, a choice you make in the iPhoto Preferences\n\nA: You should not be concerned. iPhoto never changes anything about an original image in its library. Originals are always kept in their unedited state. When you crop or scale something, and you export it, such as when you make an email attachment, iPhoto generates a new image in the smaller size, while keeping the original untouched. This also applies to any other kinds of edits, such as changing the exposure, rotating, applying effects, or anything else. You can view an edited photo, and you can export an edited photo or print it, but the iPhoto database always keeps the original photo, and you can always revert to that if you need to.\nThis concept is called non-destructive editing, and it is a feature of many programs that edit images, video or audio--not just the iPhoto program.\n", "Q: Is there a desktop twitter client that has a built in browser? I really like the iPad version of twitter, in that it opens up links to the right of your stream. No need to go anywhere else. Of course, the new browser based client opens photos on the right. But Twitter for Mac only opens up links in your regular browser.\nDoes anyone know of a desktop client that has its own built-in browser?\n\nA: Hibari gets you part of the way there. It shows inline image links in the timeline.\nPersonally, I don't see how loading other links automatically is all that desirable or safe.\n\nA: I can't think of one with a built in browser but if you use Safari you could always install the Twitter pluggin. This provides you with the opportunity to read your stream right there in the browser so it's almost what you're looking for, just in the reverse direction. For Firefox there are a number of download add-ons that you can use to do the same, and for Chrome I would recommend TweetDeck.\n\nA: I don't know about a desktop twitter client, but there are many plugins available for browsers that allow you to tweet and surf.  Check out the Firefox or Google Chrome plugins for a twitter client. Would this meet your needs?\n", "Q: How can I see what bandwidth each App or process is using? I see suddenly that my downstream bandwidth is 400 KBps which is the maximum my ISP gives me, so there's an application downloading at its top capacity.\nThe thing is I didn't start any download, so it's doing it in the background without telling.\nHow can I know which app or process is using it?\nOr, basically, how can I determine how much bandwidth each open process or application is using?\n\nA: Just to complement the (terrific) nettop answer - some complained that the output is cryptic. For clean output, try:\nnettop -P -k state,interface -d\nFlags explained:\n-P collapses the rows of each parent process\n-k state,interface removes less informative columns that stand between you and the bytes in/out columns\n-d activates the delta option (same as pressing the d button)\nUse the h button or run man nettop for some more options.\n\nA: You can easily view all network activity from the Activity Monitor; it's built right in to OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor\n\n*Click Network tab\n\n\n\n\nA: \nQuote: \"How can I know which app or process is using it?\"\n\nYou can try nettop(1) in the Terminal. It is pre-installed, and refreshes every few seconds to provide a dashboard of all open network connections (by process) with their usage. Better than lsof since it shows the usage data too.\n$ nettop\n\nThen hit 'd' and look for odd-looking entries or entries with consistently large traffic in the 'bytes in' or 'bytes out' column. The 'd' instructs nettop to only show differences in each screen refresh.\nPractical usage notes:\nIf you don't recognize the process name, Google it.\nIf you don't want the process around, get the pid (the number next to the process name in nettop), and kill it with kill -9 <pid>. If that doesn't solve it, find out if you can uninstall the process.\nIf you're interested in what the process is transmitting over the network, use the client port number for that particular connection (e.g. '53133' from 10.0.0.1:53133->74.125.68.100:80) to run a tcpdump(1) to see the data in the packets being exchanged: sudo tcpdump -nnvvXSs 1514 port 53133\nIf you're interested in the destination the process is talking to, but the destination IP address doesn't have a reverse DNS hostname (like in the previous example), then try visiting that IP address in a web browser as https://IP, click the broken lock icon in the address bar, and view the certificate details to find out which domain is served there (*.google.com in this case). This won't work if SSL port 443 isn't open on the destination.\n\nA: lsof and iftop (direct Link to install package) are the best tools that come to mind.\nAlso, take a look at this question.\n\nA: Rubbernet is a really great app that allows you to see the per application network usage of your Mac plus it supports Remote Monitoring. You can install a Rubbernet plugin any Mac that you have administrative access and then monitor the per application bandwidth utilization of all the Macintosh on your network from your own computer.\nIt does cost money (30 Euros on their website but for some reason its $19.99 on the Mac App Store but they have a fully functional Free Trial on their website. I haven't bought the app yet, so I can not confirm that you can buy one license for the app and then install the plugin on any number of Macs for now additional charge. But that seems to be the situation.\nThe Developers are the same folks who do the Linkinus IRC Client.\nlink to rubbernet removed as it lead to a website with a fake alert about updating out of date Flash\n\nA: This help at all? Take a look at the NetMonitor Sidekick add on. Have not tried it myself but will probably load on virtual machine to see how it works.\nhttp://netmonitor.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/net.html\n\nA: Update: This app no longer exists\nAnother option that is not quite as good as it does not have any kind of remote monitoring mechnaism and didn't seem to do as good a job is OS Track. Its also available on the Mac App Store for free. I didn't really like this app as it seemed to consume a lot of resources itself. But that might be something they fixed in a later version.\n\nA: sudo fs_usage might id the process\n\nA: Little Snitch offers a great Network Monitor that gives all sorts of details including transfer rates and which processes have used the most data.

Does iCloud  work with Mail and a Gmail account, or do I need to necessarily create a .me account and then forward the mails from gmail to .me ?\n\nA: If you have a .mac or .me account, you will use that as your iCloud email address. Otherwise, you will get a new mail account. You can either forward your gmail messages or use two different accounts (or not use iCloud for mail).\n\nA: In answer to your question to completely sync the 2 accounts, the answer is yes.  Your .me or .mac account will sync to iCloud.  \nYour gmail account will sync to Google's \"cloud\" if you enabled IMAP which automatically syncs all of your gmail.  \nIf you have POP mail enabled for gmail, then those messages exist on your hard drive.\nI use gmail via IMAP and I have 8 years of mail messages synced/stored in my gmail account.  You can check your gmail settings to see which one is enabled on your gmail account.\n\nA: A me.com iCloud.com or Mac.com are all the same. They all sync to iCloud. Then what you can do is go to your gmail account at gmail.com and go to settings/accounts and enter in some iCloud information found on https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202304 and you just enter the information in the help article to the gmail accounts page. \n", "Q: I can't trash files anymore, but only delete them directly When I want to delete a file in Finder or in the Desktop a popup appears and it says it will be deleted immediately, and I need to confirm.\nThe trash is always empty, and I can't use it anymore. \nWhat's going on with Snow Leopard and not having a working trash can?\n\nA: Check the ownership and permissions on ~/.Trash.\nmress:10039 Z$ ls -ld ~/.Trash \ndrwx------  285 allbery  staff  9690 Jun 28 16:53 /Users/allbery/.Trash/\n\nMy guess is it somehow ended up being owned by root, but there are other possibilities.  If it's the owner, the fix is sudo chown $USER ~/.Trash ~/.Trash/.DS_Store.\n", "Q: How to uninstall an uninstalled app from the App Store? I tried to install Xcode from the App Store. While it was being downloaded, a network problem occurred so the installation didn't complete. However, in the App Store, it appears marked as installed (so now I can't install it).\nI don't see any uninstall option. Is there any way to uninstall it from the backend or something like that?\n\nA: In the special case of Xcode, the App Store downloads an installer app that you use to install Xcode. Look in /Applications for \"Install Xcode.app\" and delete that. \nWhen you get Xcode installed properly, if you delete the installer, the App Store won't think it's installed and won't display updates. \n\nA: Just throwing out some random suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, remember to empty your trash.\n\n*Check ~/Music/iTunes and see if you can find it there. Try moving anything related to Xcode to the trash (and empty).\n\n*See if you have /Library/Developer. Maybe you can find any uninstaller there.\n\n\nA: This is the first time I ever heard of installing Xcode with iTunes, but try the Xcode commandline uninstaller: sudo Xcode directory/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all. If the uninstaller isn't there, (because you say it's incomplete), just delete the folder (usually at /Developer) or reinstall by downloading the .dmg that can be found at http://developer.apple.com/.\n\nA: The app store is marking this as installed because there's part of a .dmg or some other file type somewhere hiding. If you go to the 'Purchased' tab in the App store you should get the option to re-install once you remove this file.\nThe App Store downloads its files to a temp directory before moving the .app file to your Applications Folder. The directory is \n/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/AppStore/\n\nGo to that directory and look for anything that says Xcode and get rid of it. Then redownload and install from the App Store's Purchased tab.\n\nA: Had the same problem with \"Pickr.app.\" and found a solution. My problem was that it didn't show up in Launchpad, but the Mac App Store said 'installed'.\nGo to /Applicatons/or ~/Applications and manually delete your app, in my case \"Pickr.app\", then reinstall.\n", "Q: What does the Delete key do on the English QWERTY keyboard? I have a French AZERTY keyboard with a Backspace key (that can be modified with Fn into Delete) and to my surprise I saw on the Apple Store that the English QWERTY keyboard had a Delete key in its place, so I'm wondering if it's really a Delete key (erase right) that can be modified with Fn into Backspace, or not.\nEdit: If I try on the virtual keyboard with American layout, the key does erase left.\n\nA: On the English QWERTY keyboards, the Delete key functions as a Backspace key, and can be turned into an erase right key with the fn modified key.\n\nA: The Delete (delete forward) key, when standalone, is called Del on both Mac and PC keyboards.  Of the 6 keyboards I have convenient here (1 each full size and laptop PC, 2 full-size and 2 laptop Mac), the delete-backwards key is called Backspace on the PC keyboards and Delete on the Macs.  (The Del key is called that on all the keyboards that have it or a marker for it.)\nPedantically, the Macs are correct, as the concept of \"backspace\" doesn't include erasing but the Backspace / Delete key does erase.\n", "Q: 10.6.8 update caused ethernet outage After an update to 10.6.8 my ethernet stopped working. I understand this affected millions of mac users. Is there a way to revert in OSX? This is the newest MBP 13\" 2.7 GHz i7.\n\nA: A brute force way of dealing with this is to call Apple and open a ticket.  I've done this in the past on Macs w/o Applecare.\nThe upside is they are best positioned to help you and it puts you in the best position to get it resolved.  \nThere's a fee if you don't have Applecare.  My suggestion is to agree to the fee and  after they've got you up and running, ask that they to waive the fee in light of whatever they had to do to fix the problem.\n\nA: I would go here 10.6.8 Combo updater from Apple and download it via wi-fi and then re-run it. This often will fix whatever issues occurred with a Software Update via the built-in app.\nA word of caution is to have a backup before doing this. \n\nIs there a way to revert in OSX?\n\nIf you have a Time Machine backup that would be the easiest way to revert.\n", "Q: Process called \"Dock\" running at 100% since upgrade to 10.6.8 \nAny ideas what might be causing this? \n\nA: Found this answer on CNET:\n\nThe problem appears to be an incompatibility with Parallels Desktop 6, which has an option to make Windows applications available in the Dock for convenient access. This incompatibility will likely require an update from Parallels to fix, but until then one option you have is to disable the Dock applications setting for each virtual machine you have configured.\n\n", "Q: Use external display only with MacBook? I have a Mid 2010 MacBook. Is it possible to make the external display into the only one, so that I can close the lid and keep working on my MacBook with an external keyboard/mouse and monitor?\n\nA: Yes. It usually \"just works,\" but if you're having trouble, Apple has detailed instructions:\nApple Portables: How to use your computer in closed clamshell (display closed) mode with an external display\n\nA: Yes, it is possible (I use mine like this al the time).  All you need to do is ensure that the external power supply is plugged in.\nIf you intend on using this setup all the time, ensure you occasionally (say once a month), unplug the external power supply and use the battery.\n", "Q: How can I perform an Apple Hardware Test without my original install media? I have a 2007 MacBook that I'd like to perform an Apple Hardware Test on, but I don't have the original install media. I have a Snow Leopard install DVD, but rebooting and holding down D does not launch the test. Short of going to the Apple Store, is there any way to test the hardware?\n\nA: I've never been able to figure out why this function seems so unreliable - holding D for diagnostics doesn't seem to work for me in practice. I wish I had a better explanation than \"many models don't have this and even the ones that do, this isn't something I can count on.\"\nI have come to rely on AHT that are available for authorized Apple technicians to download so you might be able to get help from one closer than an Apple Store - http://www.apple.com/buy/locator/service/\nApple will usually run a very good test for free as past of a genius bar appointment, and both Apple and Authorized Service will usually check a mac in for diagnostics under coverage for no charge. Out of warranty, expect to pay $39 to $85 for a diagnostic.\nLastly, you can order replacement media if yours are misplaced from Apple. 800-APL-CARE\n\nA: The only thing you can do with the Snow Leopard disk is to boot to it by holding \"C\". You could also hold down the option key and pick the disc to boot off of. \nThen you can go to the Utilities Menu>Disk Utility and run \"Verify/Repair Permissions\" and \"Verify/Repair Disk\".

I used to find color codes which I want to use for texts or background colors on htmls with color edit tool of MS paint which pre-installed on Windows.\nBut now I use Mac instead of Windows.\nHow can I find color codes with Mac?\nIs an software like MS paint pre-installed on Mac?\n\nA: The Digital Color Meter in /Applications/Utilities/ is the best choice.\n\nColor panel - picker \nThis picker is almost everywhere   if you look carefully.\nLook closely at font controls and you will likely see wording like Format -> Font -> Show Colors, or Format -> Show colors. (The shortcut is usually ⇧⌘C). You will get the small color panel shown above, where you can click the \"magnifying lens\" and you can grab the color from anywhere in the screen. for example: TextEdit, Pages, Mail etc... This is a clipboard to save colors, but doesn't report hex values, CIE values or the ITU-R  Y'PbPr/Y'CbCr values for the chosen color.\nEverywhere when you can show the font panel (usually ⌘T), you can click the \"Text color\" icon in the font panel and you will get again the \"Color panel\" (with picker).\nYou can for example when entering text into textbox here, right click for bring up contextual menu, and go to \"Font -> Show colors\" directly from the Safari... This works in every application where you can change fonts.\nIn every application where you can change the color for anything with color field, you can click the border of \"color field\" and you will get the color panel again. For example Terminal.app -> Preferences -> Settings (color fields for text and Cursor colors)\nYou can download a some cool color-helper dasboard widgets, like: colourmod or ColorTheory.\nYou can download a plugin into color panel for hexadecimal color values.\nIf you find yourself needing the DCM often, you might look at \nusing Automator.app to create a global \"Service\" that launches the Digital Color Meter.app. Now you are a few clicks away and can additionally bind this new service to a global hotkey in the System Preferences. The result: running DCM from anywhere, anytime, on a custom key command.\n\nHere are several more things - but lastly: you can also run Windows in VirualBox and use the MsPaint method.  /joking/ - be cool. :) :)\n\nEdit: added another screenshot with color profiles\n\n\nA: I prefer RCWebColorPicker extiesion, check it here: http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCWebColorPicker/\n\n\nA: There is a utility (in Applications/Utilities) called Digital Color Meter, which shows the color code of whatever you're hovering at the moment. It's a bit more lightweight than Preview. There are also shortcuts for copying the color value as a string (⇧+⌘+C) or image (⌥+⌘+C).\n\nA: This has now gone out of business first renamed to Hues then out of business http://giantcomet.com/hues/\nI quite like the completely-free app Spot Color. It uses the Mac's built-in color pickers and allows you to grab the color and then use the various sliders and color models to modify it, as you asked about in your followup comment.\n\nSince it uses the Mac's color pickers it means you can also use any of the various additional color pickers out on the web, such as:\nHex Color Picker\n\nand Developer Color Picker\n\n\nA: Just Color Picker\nIt is a free app in the app store.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/just-color-picker/id886547068?l=pl&mt=12\nIt does the job for web developers!

Can I somehow connect it to an external monitor? Or is there another way of doing this?\nThanks\n\nA: You should be able to connect it to an external monitor.  All you need to do (in principle) is this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Close lid, let computer go to sleep\n\n*Connect both the power supply and external monitor\n\n\nAbout a second after you connect the external monitor, it should wake up and direct all output to the external monitor.  (It will only do this if the lid is closed, external power is connected, and something is connected to the video output port.)\nNote that depending on the speed of your computer and other factors, it may take a little while for anything to show up on the screen.

However, the hard drive enclosure needs to be of a special type (ZIF 1.8\" like this one)\n\nA: To complete the trifecta of answers, you can also network boot the Air to another mac running deploy studio.\nIt's some work to set up the deploy studio, but you can easily automate the erase process with a few known single key commands. Once you have the erase option figured out, you don't need to see the screen, just a working keyboard.\nThe other downside is if an error pops up, you might not be able to read it.  \nThis is less easy than removing the drive or hooking an external monitor, but once set up, it's useful software to have around. \n", "Q: Autocomplete is broken in Google Chrome I use Google Chrome as browser.

Here' is the description from their web site:\n\"Save long web pages to read later, when you have time, on your computer, iPhone, iPad, or Kindle.\"\nI use it so I can save something on my phone and read it later from another device.\n\nA: Here's a nice selection. Delibar is pretty nice, but the Pro version gives you more control, which costs $18. Check out Cocoalicious. It's a nice desktop manager for all of your bookmarks. You can categorize them, give descriptions, etc. :) Delish is similar to Cocoalicious, but perhaps more Leopard-y (it mimics the Finder). It will cost you $9 for the pro version.\n", "Q: Iphone system log - recurring springboard warning I used the Iphone configuration utility to help a developer troubleshoot an unrelated issue.

You know, the MacBook has such a beautiful trackpad. Are there applications that use its power for music-making, drawing, or anything else unusual?\n\nA: In the \"unusual\" camp there's a program called Inklet that purports to turn your trackpad into a Wacom-like tablet. They also sell a special stylus and sketching software.\nFor music there's Trackpad Magic, which allows you to create music using trackpad for input, and djay, a DJ'ing app that lets you \"scratch\" records with your trackpad.\n\nA: There is MultiTouchMIDI by Jeff Kaufman, a free software that translate pressure on the trackpad into MIDI signal.\nYou can then use a music software to translate this MIDI into audio.\nIt is then a good Idea to have an external mouse that can control the pointer. Check \"Ignore Trackpad when Mouse is plugged in\" under Universal Access, so the mouse holds still when you play music.\n\nA: EDIT: I just now realized you meant software applications, not practical applications. Answering that question, there aren't any applications that I know of that have specific functionality built in for the gestures of the Magic Trackpad. There are lots of applications that allow for performing basic functions using trackpads, but nothing beyond basic scrolling and clicking gestures.\nOriginal Answer:\nI use my Magic Trackpad exclusively and have found the gestures to be the most useful. As a drawing tool (I'm a graphic designer) it is not good...get a tablet for that. I have configured my gestures so that they invoke various tools or perform specific actions like creating or deleting a layer. There are keyboard shortcuts to performs these tasks, but I find a motion gesture to be faster than contorting my fingers to hit Command+Ctrl+N, etc. \nSome of my global actions include:\n3-Finger Tip-Swipe Down: Launch Chrome\n3-Finger Tip-Swipe Up: Launch Mail\n3-Finger Tip-Swipe Right: Launch iTunes\n3-Finger Swipe Down: (Command+W)\n3-Finger Swipe Up: (Command+T) // for creating tabs in browsers\n3-Finger Click-Swipe Down: (Command-Q)\n\n4-Finger Swipe Up: Reveal Desktop\n4-Finger Swipe Down: Expose\n4-Finger Swipe Left/Right: Application Scrolling (Alt+Tab)\n\n5-Finger Swipe Left/Right: Snap window left/right\n5-Finger Swipe Up/Down: Maximize/center window\n\n", "Q: Using grep on Mac-style text files When I run grep on a text file, I get nonsense results. It seems as if the whole file is printed out but on one line overwriting itself.   I read that on the Mac, text files use \\r instead of the normal \\n as a line ending.  That would explain it, but how to make grep treat \\r as if it were \\n?\nI'm using Snow Leopard OS X, and am quite new to using Apple anything, but a long-time Linux programmer.\n\nA: You can't change grep's behavior, but you can change the file it sees:\ntr '\\r' '\\n' <file | grep foo\n\nAlso, \\r line endings are legacy these days; OS X officially uses \\n, although there are still things that haven't been updated.  In particular, AppleScript still hasn't quite caught up, which also shows in its using pre-OS X file paths by default and requiring POSIX file to indicate OS X native paths; also, many Carbon applications still use \\r, Carbon being a transition framework from Mac OS 9 to OS X.\n\nA: A common legacy utility for handling line endings is flip. It does in-place transformation for files between Unix, DOS/Windows, legacy Mac line-end formats, and can also sample a file to let you know what type it currently thinks it is. It doesn't ship with OSX, but you can get binaries from the link as well as source.\nIn this case, you can first flip -u yourFile.txt to make sure it's using newlines and not linefeeds to demarcate lines, and then use grep on it.\n", "Q: Adding Mac-specific directory to PATH when home is shared My /home/myusername/ directory is provided through a network, and looks exactly the same on my Linux machine and my Mac Mini.   I'd like to add to PATH a directory of Mac-specific software in my home, e.g. /home/myusername/SW/bin_mac/ and have this happen only when I'm doing command line stuff on the Mac, and not have PATH contain this when on Linux.  If I edit .bashrc (or tcsh's equivalent) it'll affect PATH in both cases.  What are some tricks to do this?\n\nA: Test the output of uname; it will be Darwin on OS X and Linux on Linux.\nif [[ $(uname) == Darwin ]]; then\n    export PATH=\"$HOME/SW/bin_mac:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nAlternately, you could just add an appropriate directory on each machine, which will be useful if you find yourself needing a separate Linux bin directory as well in the future.\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/SW/bin_$(uname):...\"\n\nand either mv or ln -s your bin_mac to bin_Darwin; then you can create a bin_Linux directory in the future if you need it, and it'll just work.\n(You could also test $HOSTTYPE, which is set by bash, but it contains more information than you're likely to need.)\n", "Q: Firefox doesn't respond to a shortcut for window zooming, because it has another \"zoom\" menu item, how can I avoid this? Firefox has a problem by which you can't assign it a shortcut to zoom the window.\nAs it has another menu item named \"Zoom\" which actually has subitems for zoom in, etc. you can't map the shortcut by menu item name, because that item takes the stroke instead of the window zoom.\nI tried to edit Firefox's resources, to see if there was a .nib where I could rename the menu item to another thing so the shortcut would find the correct \"zoom\" item, but failed.\nDoes someone have a solution for this?  \nedit: I'm talking about MacOS's Zoom Window action equivalent to Windows' Maximize, and not about zooming the contents in or out.  \n\nA: Firefox uses XUL files to define its user interface on all platforms. I just did a little poking in my Firefox.app 4.0.1 bundle:\n\n\n*\n\n*The XUL files are stored in Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/omni.jar. (jar files can be unpacked with any Zip  archive tool, or the jar command-line tool which takes options like tar.)\n\n*The relevant XUL file may be chrome/browser/content/browser/baseMenuOverlay.xul. See also the referenced DTD files for the definitions of the entities like &zoomWindow.label;.\n\n\nSince you're editing the files anyway, you might as well add a shortcut there rather than changing the name to use the system shortcut customizer.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts and add one for Firefox. Get the name of the menu item for, say, Zoom In and assign it a shortcut, then repeat for Zoom Out.\nIt sounds like you're saying there is some reason you can't do this, but if you tell it \"Zoom In\" (or whatever it's called; I haven't installed Firefox on this computer yet) rather than \"Zoom\" I don't see why it wouldn't work.\n\nA: Apple - Shift - F will do the trick, I believe. \n", "Q: What are some considerations in organizing apps in the dock? I am relatively new to Mac and OS X (4 months now). While I build my collection of preferred applications my Dock keeps on growing. It now takes about 70% of my screen width and I start to find it a bit messy.\nI like to keep things organised and was wondering what are common practices to do so?\nI know some people organise apps in folders by category/type, but how do I do it actually? \nHow is the icon for such a folder selected? Can I customise it?\nPS. Screenshots are welcome.\nPS2. If you have any recommendations of icon sources for organising Apps into folders, that'd be helpful, too.\n\nA: There are lots of little application launcher utilities available, to name two Overflow and the venerable DragThing.\nPersonally, I prefer keyboard-based launchers like Alfred or LaunchBar.\nOS X Lion will have feature called Launchpad which looks like it will be a good replacement to the dock for launching applications.\nOrganizing Apps in the Finder or launching them all via the Dock is rather futile, in my opinion — unless you have a very small collection of Applications…\nIf you're looking for folder icons, there are tons of online sources. I recommend the Iconfactory to start. \nCustomization: in the Finder if you use the Command Get Info in the file menu on a selected folder (also available in the right-click contextual menu), you can select the icon in the info window top-left. From there you can copy the icon resources and paste them.\nSo that's how you can customize the folders, copy icons from a downloaded folder source, and paste them into your new folders. Panic software produces an excellent Application for icon management that can also streamline this process called CandyBar.\n\nA: What I do is remove everything from your dock, but for a very few essentials.\nThe only things I keep in my Dock at all times is the \"Download\" folder.  When I need to start an app, I use Spotlight.  I don't mean, or want, to turn this into a Spotlight vs Quicksilver vs Butler debate -it's just what works for me.  \nNow, in actuality, I do have icons on my Dock often, since I always have Terminal and Safari open, along with things like the Finder and Trash (which are always there.)  \nI find it simple, quick (Spotlight is faster than mousing to the Dock) and tidy.  \nGood luck in finding something that works for you.\n\nA: My solution was to put an alias for all the applications that I wanted into a folder. Afterwards open finder and drag the folder icon from the finder window onto the Dock. To remove just drag the folder off the Dock. Clicking on the folder will open a quick display of all the aliases. The aliases take up very little space and leave all the applications in the application folder where they belong.\nTo answer your question on changing folder icons, there are a great many ways to do this, but the easiest is to click the folder, hit [apple] + [i] to open the info window, and in the top left corner will be the icon. Click on that and hit [apple] + [v] to paste in the desired image. apple's informative howto.\n\n\nA: I like to group my apps by task or use (i.e. Xcode near Textmate and Pandora near iTunes), and separate the groups with empty spaces.\nTo add empty spaces, run this command:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add ‘{ “tile-type” = “spacer-tile”; }’\n\nTo add empty spaces to the document side (right side if your Dock is on the bottom), replace persistent-apps with persistent-others. You can also add more \"recent items\" stacks (so you can have one set to recent applications, another set to recent documents, etc.) by using:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add '{ \"tile-data\" = { \"list-type\" = 1; }; \"tile-type\" = \"recents-tile\"; }'\n\n\nA: I'm using $HOME/Applications folder as a launcher. In this folder i was make several subfolders with names like \"Browsers\", \"Internet\", \"Office\", \"Productivity\", \"Imaging\" \"Sysadmin\" etc... \nWhen installing applications every app going into its default location \"/Applications\".\nFrom the default place I was linked with symbolic links (or aliases) the apps from /Applications into correct subfolder. I'm doing this every time when i'm installing new apps. Not as time-consuming as one can thing at the first reading.\nWith this approach i got an nicely sorted-list as want it myself, without need using any 3rd party application. When you drag the $HOME/Applications into the dock, you should set the view as \"List\", and will get something like the attached screenshot. (the Windows7 applications are from the Parallels)\nSome other things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Long time i was used the dock on the right side of the screen. IMHO, it is the best location, because you need the every pixel of vertical size. On the right size you must not hide the dock. I was moved the dock to the default bottom location when i started using two displays and my second display comes into the right side...\n\n*at the bottom is a good practice using Dock autohide.\n\n*keep in the dock the most frequently used apps. (i have 27) ;)\n\n*i don't using the download folder in the dock, because my Safari make date based download folders anyway. Using Safari's \"Downloads\" window for the quick access.\n\n*Lion's launchad will change things again, so you can wait a few weeks for it... ;)\n\n\nA: If you're really worried about your screen real estate  my first sugestion is to just hide the dock. That way you can access it if you need it but it doesn't take up space. As for keeping things off of it, placing an application in a folder and then dragging that folder to the right of the dashed line on the dock creates a stack. You can right click and customize the options on the stack, but it should handle itself just fine. If you don't want to move your applications around inside the actual folder in Finder, right click the ones you want to be in your stack and select 'Make Alias' and drag the alias to a folder and then make that folder into a stack just like before. I understand why people want to keep their dock simple but personally I just leave what I use the most on there and then some things that get used occasionally. You don't lose that much screen space to it and that way you can get at everything quickly if you don't want to use Spotlight/Quicksilver/Butler.\nKeep in mind that even if you take items off your dock and then launch them with one of the launcher apps, they pop right back onto the dock while you have them open.\nShort answer is to hide the dock and not lose any sleep over what is actually on it.\n\nA: I personally don't have anything on the left side of the Dock (Except finder!). I use Launchbar and only see the apps I have open on the Dock. That way I know what I am running at all times :)\n", "Q: Why has my iPhone camera stopped focusing? My camera doesn't focus any more. Is that a known issue and is there a fix for this? If not, can I take it to be fixed? I had this phone for less than a year. \n\nA: Since the phone is less than a year old, it will be covered by the default AppleCare warranty. I suggest contacting Apple, and they will probably just replace the phone outright.\n\nA: Took it in Apple store. They fixed it. The motor that does the focusing was not working.  They fixed it for free.  Person who did the job told me that I don't need a warranty if this happens in the future they'll fix it for free because it takes very little time and no parts need to be replaced. \n", "Q: How can I make Safari show the URL when I hover over a link? Safari 5.0.1 on OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) doesn't seem to have any status bar in which the URL of a link shows when the user moves the cursor over a link (without clicking)   All other browsers I've ever used do this.   \nIs there a user preference checkbox somewhere for this?\n\nA: There are two options. One is a setting, and the other is a workaround.\nHere are instructions on how to toggle the setting using the Menu Bar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into the View menu.\n\n*Select \"Show status bar\".\n\n*Now, there will be a URL that pops up when you hover over a link, and also tells you if it's going to be in a new tab:\n\n\n\nYou can also press ⌘ + / to toggle this setting at ease.\nThe second option is a workaround for when you drag links. Here's how to get this feature to appear:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click and drag the link out of where it will originally appear.\n\n*At your mouse will be a small box telling you the title of the new window and its URL, although it may be shortened.\n\n*You can also drag the link to the plus sign in your tab list, out of the window, or in a folder/the desktop to open that URL in a new tab, new window or save it to your computer, respectively.\n\n\nA: I believe this Safari Extension did precisely what you are looking to do, but it's now abandoned:\nUltimate Status Bar.\n\nA: The URL of links your hover over is shown on the gray status bar at the bottom of the page. The status bar is not always present in a new window, but you can turn it on from View > Show Status Bar or with the ⌘/ shortcut.\nSome pages can hide the status bar and it does not restore if you go to a new window. However File->New Window should always show this.\n", "Q: Run iTunes without it being in the dock I'm trying to keep my dock simple - just Chrome, MacVim, and the terminal. Is there a way to run iTunes without it being in the dock (i.e. just show the icon in the menu bar)?\n\nA: The only way for an application to not appear in the dock (while also keeping the menu bar) is for the developers to place that functionality into it. I don't use my dock as a launcher, using Butler instead (which is a dockless application, btw).\nYou might try backing up a step and asking why you want to remove the iTunes from the dock and see if there's another solution. For example, I often listen to tunes on my iPhone rather than iTunes. If it's to keep the dock clean, try a different launcher than the dock and hide the dock instead.\n\nA: From HERE. I have not personally tried it with iTunes, but it does work with some applications. \nIf you'd like to have an application running, but without a dock icon, there's a \nway achieve this by modifying the application's plist file.\n\nOpen a terminal session, and first navigate to the \"Contents\" folder of the \napplication you'd like to modify (note - you may want to make a backup of the app \nfirst, especially if it's one of the Apple-installed applications). This example \nuses Key Caps:\n\ncd 'Applications/Utilities/iTunes.app/Contents/'\n\nNow, edit the Info.plist file:\n\nvi Info.plist\n\nYou can use vi, pico, or emacs to do the editing. \n\nJust before the closing Just before the closing </dict> tag, add\n\n<key>NSBGOnly</key>\n\n<string>1</string>\n\nSave the edited Info.plist, then launch iTunes from the GUI\n(your application foler). If your edit was successful, you should see iTunes,\nbut no icon in the dock.\n\n\nA: Two things come close: you can (in Finder) select the\niTunes application and 'get info', then paste a new icon \nover the icon (at top of the info window).  The trick is, you use a\nselected patch of your desktop background picture as the\nicon (open the desktop picture in Preview, select a patch and copy).\nOr, to put items in the dock that don't take up space until you\nclick them, but are always easy to locate without navigating folders,\nmake a folder and put aliases of applications and such into it.\nThen, drag the folder to the dock, where a single click on the\nicon of the folder will show all the contents.\n", "Q: How to remove boot from MacMini? I have tried installing windows 7 on my MacMini. \nI followed following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup went perfectly But while installing I thought of not installing it. \n\n*So, I just restarted mac mini. \n\n*Pressed Alt key while booting\n\n*Started OSX \n\n*Launched Disk Utility\n\n*Removed windows partition.\n\n\nBut after doing all these stuff, I am facing new problem. Each time when macMini starts, I always have to press ALT while booting, otherwise it goes in indeterminate state. \nPlease guide me.\n\nA: According to discussions.apple.com you could also have removed the Windows partition with Boot Camp Assistant (located in /Applications/Utilities).  It may be worth trying that just in case not everything was properly cleaned up during your attempts.\nAfter that you can use go to your System Preferences, and select your OS X volume as the startup disk.\n\nA: When in the boot manager (the one when you press ⌥ Option on startup), click on the arrow (for the Mac OS X partition). The boot priority should then default to the Mac OS X one.\nOtherwise, you can try going to the Startup Disk preference pane in System Preferences, and try setting it (by restarting).\n", "Q: How to keep PowerPoint from mirroring my monitors when switching apps? When I'm in presentation mode in PowerPoint 2008, and I deliberately or accidentally switch to another app, PowerPoint forces my dual monitors into mirrored mode.\nApart from shrinking my desktop and repositioning many dozens of windows, this also forces fullscreen virtual machines onto my main monitor, such that I can't get at the menu bar without unzooming them (and consequently messing up their desktops).\nDoes anyone know how I can prevent PowerPoint from doing this?  Does PowerPoint 2011 do the same thing?  (And does it introduce yet another incompatible UI?)\n\nA: If you switch PowerPoint to display mode first, then switch to a mac app (using command-tab), then turn off mirroring, the setting should then stick. Otherwise, as you found out, Microsoft is sure nobody but powerpoint needs display mode.\nIn case some reader doesn't know how to turn off mirroring: If you go into \"System Preferences/Display Preferences\" Arrangement tab (only present when connected to a second display), uncheck the box that says \"Mirror Displays\".\nAlso, on the bottom of the Display Preferences pane, you can check \"Show displays in menu bar\" to access this setting more easily without going into preferences.\n", "Q: iPod Touch thinks it's full when it isn't I just got a refurbished iPod Touch.  I synced it to my work computer rather than my Mac at home because it is mainly for PodCasts.

I want to create a BootCamp partition on my 13\" MBP with a 250 Gb hard drive.\nThe DiskUtility shows the partition as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). \n.\nWhen trying to perform a partitioning with BootCamp Assistant, after the progress bar gets to about 40% of partitioning, I get the alert stating: \nThe disk cannot be partitioned because some files cannot be moved.\nBack up the disk and use Disk Utility to format it as a single Mac OS Extended (Journaled) volume. Restore your information to the disk and try using Boot Camp Assistant again.\nHere's what it looks like:\n\nNow this gets me confused - what I really should do and what's the core reason of the problem? \n\nA: Yep, that's kinda odd.  Might be because it needs to partition a contiguous chunk, for efficiency reasons, for Windows.  If that's the case, and it's got some immoveable files within that contiguous chunk, I could see it having issues.\nI wonder if it would be possible to run boot camp assistant from the OS X disk instead.  If you can, those files could probably be shifted as you wouldn't be booted from the 1st partition anymore.\nAlternately you could create a bootable partition on an external hard-drive and do the same from a fully functioning OS X installation.  Finally, the last resort would be to use a 3rd party utility to add that NTFS Bootcamp partition.  I don't recommend that route.\n\nA: Harv's right in that this means there isn't a big enough contiguous chunk to partition. The easiest (but perhaps most time consuming) remedy that I know of would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up using Time Machine.\n\n*Boot to the OS installer, repartition the drive as a single partition (ignore the instinct to partition the drive for Windows now - let Boot Camp assistant take care of that later).\n\n*Reinstall the OS.\n\n*Choose to restore from a Time Machine backup during the Setup Assistant.\n\n*Once this is done, run Boot Camp assistant, and then it should have no issues.\n\n\nThis has worked for me every time I've needed to do it. It might be possible to use SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner to back up the drive and just restore that image/clone the drive back over, but I don't have firsthand experience doing it that way.\n", "Q: How to convert mov to swf? I have a QuickTime .mov file which I want to convert to swf format. Is there any tool for Mac? I already search here for a similar question but couldn't find any. The google search directed me to VisualHub which was discontinued and doesn't support Snow Leopard. \nIs there a method using an Adobe CS5 app?

It has SSH based remote log viewing functionality and can tail the remote log file (configurable polling interval). You can setup multiple SSH servers and browse them to select the log file to view.\nIt supports filtering and/or highlighting search patterns, searching the remote log file incrementally, and lets you adjust the foreground, background colors and font.\nAlso, it doesn't load the entire remote log file at once but intelligently fetches content based on your scrolling actions, so it is quite efficient.\nThe app site has more information. Hope it helps! \nPS: I'm the app developer :)\n\nA: OS X has a Tail utility built right in.  \nOpen a Terminal window, and the format would be \ntail -f filename.log\nThe -f option would make sure to keep displaying new entries to the file as it's written to.\nOf course, this is the basic Unix tail utility, so there aren't coloring options and the like...  however you can open multiple terminal windows / tabs to monitor different log files as needed.\n\nA: I was looking for something similar a few months back and discovered and excellent Linux appliance distribution called Security Onion:  https://security-onion-solutions.github.io/security-onion/ \nI pretty much ignore the IDS and packet capturing (for now) and just use it for log analysis.  It was pretty simple to set up virtual box and then load the Security Onion image.  Other than being a little RAM hungry it's a great way to get some pretty sophisticated log analysis from several really good open source packages that are already integrated in a read-to-use solution.  Now that I have logging pretty much taken care of, I might start playing with some of the IDS features built into it - but that takes even more RAM...\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13 resolution problem? I just bought a MacBook Pro 13.\nwhenever I play a game that has lower resolution than 1280-800 I get two big black rectangles on both side of the screen, instead of the screen entirely filled.\nIs there any solution for this problem?\n\nA: This happens because the game is not widescreen enabled (but 4:3). This usually happens with ports of old games, from the times, when 4:3 (or close to 4:3) resolutions were common (like 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024). Look for resolution settings in the game and change it to something closer to 16:10 and the black bars will be smaller.\n", "Q: How to control apache service on OS X (start/stop/restart/graceful restart)?

How can I list my Applications by date installed? Some applications are installed from a zip file or a .dmg image, and I know that the first one, at least, preserves the Date Modified from when it was put in the zip file or compiled or whatnot.\nThe result is that some applications I just installed have a Date Modified of months or years in the past. So, I could go to the /Applications folder and sort by Date Modified but that's not too helpful.\nHow can I list Applications by date installed in OS X?\n\nA: Since applications are just copied to the drive anywhere (/Applications is simply a nice place for multi-user systems but apps run anywhere they land as long as it's readable) there is no mandatory place to record the installation.\nHave you considered using Time Machine to construct a history?\nI use BackupLoupe which will index all of your backups, so you can search and know the first backup that has that App. It's not a true installation time, but it's close within a week at worst if your backup runs at least that often.\nYou'll have to add some software that explicitly inventories your mac periodically to assemble such a list. Most of these apps are geared to remote management and not cost effective for one or a handful of macs.\n", "Q: How does Time Machine estimate required space for backup? For over 6 months now, every Time Machine backup requrests around 15GB of space for backup, but sometimes only backups up 200MB. That is a big difference.\nDoes anyone know exactly how the required space is estimated? I'd really like to reduce it because it drives Time Machine to delete old backups unnecessarily. \n\nA: Much of what happens in Time Machine is undisclosed, but we know how the algorithm works so making an educated guess is possible:\nTime Machine stores full versions of changed files on every backup. Not incremental differences. At the outset of a backup it does a search of your filesystem for files that have been modified since the last backup date. This cuts down what it has to look at. Then, for every file on this list, it compares it against the version that was last backed up. If it hasn't actually changed it just stores a pointer to the old version with some new metadata for the inode changes.\nYou've probably got timestamps changing on lots of files, but not the actual contents. So at the outset of a backup, Time Machine is adding up the size of the all files with changed timestamps and getting 15GB, but once it does the file diffs it turns out to be far less data that's actually changed. Time Machine, in the interests of being expedient about things, is likely making the cleanup space decision upfront and based on the worst-case estimate.\nIt can help to exclude some often-changing data from Time Machine backups. Things like the browser cache and IMAP mail offline archive (for example the local cache of your Gmail account). You can use the excellent and free TimeTracker tool from CharlesSoft to view the contents of your backups on a Time Machine volume. This might be able to give you an idea of what has changed from backup to backup so you can build a good exclusions list. For my recommendations on excluding things from Time Machine backups see this Ask Different answer.\n\nA: No, Time Machine does not use the Modified Date timestamps.\nOrdinarily, it uses the File System Event Store, a log of changes to the file system.  (That's also how it can usually figure out the differences so quickly, since it doesn't have to look at every file and folder on your Mac.)\nBut in some cases, it does have to do that -- after a failed backup, for example.  In that case it still doesn't use the dates; it compares everything on your system to the most recent backup, so will be in the \"Preparing\" or \"Calculating Changes\" phase for a while, and there will be a message in your system.log about a \"deep traversal\" (prior to Lion) or a \"deep scan.\"\nSee #D4 in Time Machine - Troubleshooting for some of the common culprits, and ways to see what's going on.\n", "Q: Apple Internet Sharing doesn't stay enabled I'm trying to get my Mac to latch onto my friends wifi signal and use Internet Sharing to share it with my other non-wireless desktop, but I'm running into a problem:\nApple Internet Sharing doesn't stay enabled.\nI enable wireless networking and connect to my friends network on my Mac Mini, enable Internet Sharing on the same machine, and go to my other computer to start using the internet, but when I get to my other machine I find it has no internet. Going back to the Mac Mini shows that Internet Sharing has been disabled. This is most frustrating, I'm not the only one who uses the non-wireless machine but I am the most tech savvy and as such I'm expected to make sure the network works properly. I need Internet Sharing to stay enabled so that when I go to work, my room mate can continue using the internet.\nHow can I set Apple's Internet Sharing to stay on permanently?\nPS, I suspect that Internet Sharing is disabling itself when the Mac Mini temporarily loses connectivity with my friends wireless network, but I don't understand why it doesn't (and why there is no setting for) automatically re-enabling it when reconnecting to the same wireless network.\n\nA: I never did find a way of making Internet Sharing stay on, but I did come up with a way of achieving the same result.  With a quick bit of Ruby, I whipped up this solution.\nLoad IRB by opening terminal and typing irb\nCopy and paste this into irb, and hit Enter to activate.\n while(true);sleep 15;puts Time.now.to_s + \": \" + `launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.InternetSharing.plist 2>&1`;end\n\nAs it stands, the code will re-activate Internet Sharing every 15 seconds. Now, that may seem like too short of a period, but at 15 seconds there's a good chance that the connection will be re-enabled before any connection drops occur.  You can change 15 to any number of seconds that you like.\nThis will result in a log such as:\nMon Jul 25 09:37:07 -0400 2011: com.apple.InternetSharing: Already loaded\nMon Jul 25 09:37:22 -0400 2011: com.apple.InternetSharing: Already loaded\nMon Jul 25 09:37:37 -0400 2011: com.apple.InternetSharing: Already loaded\n\nIt's important to remember that closing the window will terminate the script (Internet Sharing won't re-activate every 15 seconds), so if you need to close the window, consider using screen which is included on Macs.\n", "Q: How to make iPhone camera silent? On my iPhone, the camera shutter sound follows the ring/silent switch. However, I'd like the camera to be always silent, regardless of whether incoming calls & messages make a sound. Is there any way to configure it that way?\n(Non-jailbroken iPhone 4 with latest iOS.)\n\nA: It may not be the best solution, but I use an old headphone jack.  Essentially, I cut the end of the cord up to the point where the jack is.  I use the jack as a \"sound\" blocker.  Does wonders if you don't mind a little jack sticking out at the bottom lol\n\nA: A simple solution is to use the mute switch on the side of the phone.  The camera shutter sound is controlled by the ringer volume, since the mute switch mutes the ringer the shutter sound is also mute.  However, you are asking an optional permanent solution.  So far there is none.  The application doesn't have any additional options within the app or within System Preferences.\nDigging into the app store there is a simple camera application called Secret Camera - Taking Photo Secretly for $1.99. Apple Store Link It looks like it functions like the normal Camera application, but reading its description it doesn't explicitly mention a shutter mute option.  I assume this is an implied feature due to the app's name.\n\nA: Don't think there's an option to disable the camera shutter sound, but here is a guide on how to disable the sound.\n\nA: Initially, silencing the camera was a simple flick of the physical mute switch, however many governments now regulate this and the os will bypass many efforts to silence the capture noise. \n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone makes shutter sound when taking photos despite being on mute\nThis may or may not work long term since video capture is typically silent and extracting high quality stills is easy. Also, Live Photo feature further blurs the line between a photo and a video that pre-records the scene before you trigger a “photo” from the “camera”. \n\nA: just flip the the phone's ring/silent switch to silent.\n", "Q: My Macbook Air 2010 (11 inch) goes black and needs to be restarted every 8 - 12 or so hours I have no idea why this is happening as nothing seems to trigger it.

Only a restart will let me use the laptop again.\nI'm usually not even touching the computer when this happens. One moment the screen or screensaver is on, and the next moment the black non-responsive screen of death happens.\n\nA: This sounds like a problem with your logic board.\nYou can run a preliminary hardware test by plugging in your Mac OS X flash drive, and holding down the 'D' key when starting up. See this Apple support article for more info.\nA bad logic board usually needs replacing, which can be expensive.

Many of the .html files contain links to others amongst themselves where the case of the URL does not match the name of the file.  For example, somefile.html contains\n<A HREF=\"AnotherFile.html\">...</A>\n\nbut the actual file is named anotherfile.html, all lower case.  \nThe easy workaround is to edit the URL in Safari's address bar, fine for just once but gets tedious when I'm hopping around reading massive amounts of brain fodder.  A harder but once-only workaround is to edit the .html files by hand (or clever perl script or whatever), but I don't want to lose the fixes if I upgrade the thing or have to install it on another machine. (And I don't feel like doing such grunt work today.)  \nIs there a Safari extension or something that can make Safari try a little harder when opening files, to be case insensitive if it doesn't initially find an exact match?   This needs to work only for file: protocol.  \n\nA: If you do have your drive formatted as case sensitive, use Disk Utility (Applications->Disk Utility) to create a non-case sensitive disk image. Copy all the files over to said disk image and you should be good to go.\nIt's a little bit of a pain to mount the disk image when you need to look at the files, but probably far easier than attempting to normalize the upper/lower caseness of every filename & href in the html.\n", "Q: Terminal Encoding Not Working For Certain Characters EDIT\nThis problem was solved in my case by changing terminal emulation from VT100 to xterm.

I'd like to know what the cause of this problem is and how I might go about fixing it.\n\nA: Huh.  Sure enough, it's not setting up VT100 line drawing by default, and apparently programs don't bother with little things like how you're supposed to send enacs before using smacs any more (no doubt because some Linux terminal emulator doesn't require it, therefore \"nobody does\").\nAnyway, quick fix (here, at least) is to add to your ~/.bashrc\ntest -t && tput enacs\n\n", "Q: Macbook Battery Cycle Count (Unibody White 2010) I have a macbook white unibody 2010 (A1342) that is now 17 months old. I'm wondering if my battery is still good? The battery's information is below.\nDesign Capacity: 5200mAh\nCurrent Capacity: 4578mAh (84% left)\nMac model: 6,1\nAge of macbook: 17 months\nBattery loadcycles: 187\nCondition: Normal\nThank you!\n\nA: Any Apple store or Authorized Service Provider can run a diagnostic for you within a few minutes to gauge the health of the battery for the official Apple answer to your question.\nHowever, saving a trip and appointment and just looking at what you posted, it looks like it is in correct working order for the age. \nThe design capacity is the total charge the battery was produced for. If you ran this check on the day you bought the MacBook the current capacity should have been right around 5200. Just like a rechargeable battery in a phone, toy, etc. it never fully charges to its designed capacity over time. It is just the nature of rechargeable batteries. So now, your battery when fully charged will only charge to the current capacity.\nGiven that you have used it for 17 months. These results seem in-line.  \nAccording to this Apple KB Article, your model does not require any calibration. \nThey also publish some tips in this KB Article.\nHere's a great app for checking the battery and it gives some great definitions and links to Apple as well.\nHope that helps. \n\nA: Although the previous answer by @ivonesh is totally correct and has awesome links (+1 for that), your battery might be showing signs of early wear.\nIt's not a big deal, and it could still make it another 800 cycles and only lose another 4% of capacity, but do keep an eye on it. It's certainly within spec right now, but the loss in capacity seems to be higher than expected for 17 months and 176 cycles.\nIf you have coverage for three years, you might take it in before that ends to see where you stand in another 19 months. Also - if you can keep it cool (well below 85°F on average) that will reduce the losses all Lithium based batteries have due to time and temperature.\nKeep using it, just be aware that once it starts to go, the capacity tends to fall off more drastically and not slowly like in the first years. Also, there's lots of good use still in a battery once it's below 80% full charge capacity - so that's not anything other than a sign it's aging and it's also the line in the sand where apple expects will cover a battery due to premature loss of capacity.\nAll batteries degrade over time, but bad batteries degrade much faster or fail before they can provide the 1000 cycles they were designed to last.\n", "Q: Inserting links in the Pages document Here is a nuisance that I'm encountering during my word processing using Apple Pages.

This would seem to be the default behaviour, except when I press \"1\" or \"2\" it just stops playing and focus goes to the \"jump to\" textbox.\nAlso, would it be possible to automatically set a fading effect for the switch?\n\nA: Right.

This approach is more efficient that having a script looping/polling.\n", "Q: Is it possible to rotate images in Preview in degrees other than 90? I want to rotate an image in preview but I only need to move it a few degrees.  Is this possible?  Or can you only rotate 90 degrees?\n\nA: Copy-paste the image into another image or new file (cmd+N)\nand twist the pasted object with two fingers.\n(as shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvE2DHJOTCE)\n\nA: There is a way to do it using Preview, although it is imprecise. \nYou can use a two finger twisting gesture to arbitrarily rotate the image within preview. Now, it snaps back to normal once you let go, but if you take a screenshot to clipboard while maintaining the rotated view, then paste from the clipboard into preview, then save. Then I open the image again and do a little bit of cropping to get it looking nice.\nI mapped the 'screenshot to clipboard' function to a key combination that was easy to hit while maintaining my twist.\nObviously a dedicated app will do the job better, but I thought it was worth mentioning my OS only workaround which I discovered.\n\nA: In Yosemite, open the image in Photos and crop it - this function brings up a grid and alignment tool, you can then save the image simply aligned, but not necessarily cropped.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Preview can only rotate in 90* increments and flip images.\nIf you want to rotate a different amount, you'll have to use a more-powerful program, like Photoshop or Pixelmator.\nFrom Preview Help:\n\n\nA: It's possible to do this by copying or opening the object in a separated window, then there you can rotate it. Next, just copy back the object already at the desired position. This is the only way I've found, and works for quick tasks.\n\nA: In Preview, yes...!  I just discovered.  Hold the option button down, and use 2 fingers on the trackpad.  So many hidden features.\n\nA: There's no current way to do that with Preview, although you can use ImageMagick's convert command to do it:\nconvert your_input_image_name.png -rotate X new_output_image_name_path.png\n\nThis command will rotate your image X degrees, accepting a positive or negative value.\nFinally, you'll probably want to remove the white background:\nconvert rotated_image_name_path.png -transparent white final_output_image_name_path.png\n\n\nA: If you're not averse to using the command line, you can use the sips command to rotate images. For example…\nsips -r 23 --padColor FFFFFF image.jpg\n\n…will rotate image.jpg 23 degrees clockwise and \"fill in\" the empty space with white. (If you rotate PNGs, the alpha channel should be retained.)\nWorth reading the man page for sips as it can do other useful stuff.\n\nA: I love the free ToyViewer.app (check Mac App Store). Can do some cool things with images. Small and fast.\n\n\nA: Apparently, it used to be possible by holding down the option key while rotating (using the button on the toolbar), at least according to this forum entry from 2005:\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2005012115382953\nBut it didn't work for me on OS X Mountain Lion, all the option button did was change the rotation direction (for the rotation button on the toolbar).\n\nA: I found an online website that does it (probably there are many others):\n\n\n*\n\n*LunaPic (http://www140.lunapic.com/editor/)\n\n\nNo need to register or install anything. Just upload the picture, type how many degrees should be rotated and done.\n\nA: You can do this straight from Preview if you're on a MacBook. Just put two fingers on the touch pad, rotate, and viola. Unfortunately, there is no way to input exactly the degrees to which you want to rotate, but this at least allows for an approximation.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Create calendars directly from iPhone I have a friend whose iPhone (latest gen, relatively recent iOS but I don't think it's fully up to date) doesn't have any calendars on it.  I don't think it's ever been sync'd, and even if it had, she has Windows 7 (which doesn't by default come with a calendar app), and she doesn't have Outlook.  So my idea was to sync the device with a calendar app to force it to create a calendar, but that's obviously not going to work here.\nUPDATE: She just called me to say she restarted the phone and the default cal came back (???).\nBut the question stands:  is it possible to create a calendar without doing any sort of sync whatsoever, just directly from the phone?  How?\n\nA: Since I've enabled iCloud a while ago, I'm not sure if that'll work the same way for local calendars.\nYou should see a button that says Calendars in the top left corner in iCal on your iPhone. Tap it, then tap Edit. You should now be able to add a calendar and assign a title and color.\nPlease let me know if this works for you.\n", "Q: Apple site on Safari not working properly Here is an interesting issue: on the Mac and iPod sections of Apple's site there are the products subsections (Mac, Applications, Accessories, Server, on the Mac page and Products, iTunes and more, on the iPod page).

You can do the effects/transitions inside, or export and edit it Final Cut or iMovie.\nThis is an example clip I did a while ago with ScreenFlow and Final Cut.\n", "Q: Restarting sound service? My macbook pro running Snow Leopard stopped making sounds a couple hours ago. I've found other reports of people with sounds working through headphones, but that's not the problem I'm seeing. I get no sound when my headphones are plugged in either.\nI'm wondering if there's a LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon to restart which would remedy this. I've already tried killing the coreaudio daemon (and it dutifully automatically restarted) but that didn't fix it.\nI need to reboot for an OS update, so I think that'll probably rectify things. \nIs there another way?\n\nA: sudo pkill -9 coreaudiod kills the coreaudio process immediately. MacOS will automatically restart the coreaudio daemon, which will fix audio output in most cases.\nThis works on all MacOS versions.\n\nA: sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext \n\nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\n\nThese two commands will unload then reload the audio kernel extension. This is cleaner than sending a kill signal but might need an adjustment for newer OS.\n\nA: You can kill the CoreAudio process by opening Terminal and running:\nsudo kill -9 `ps ax|grep 'coreaudio[a-z]' | awk '{print $1}'`\n\nIt will restart automatically after a couple seconds.\nThat fixes some problems my aging MBP has been having, where it sometimes fails to detect headphones or decides the speakers aren't connected. No guarantees it will work for every audio problem, but it's worth a shot.\nSource: zakgreant on macosxhints forums.\n\nA: In my experience, a reboot is required to fix this. It's a poor fix since it seems to recover from the failure and not address the root cause. I would like to have, but have not yet discovered if there is another quicker/simpler method to get sound back...\n\nA: I am on 10.9.2 and have the same problem. Since there are two answers, I wanted to document my findings:\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext \nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\n\nThese two commands will unload then reload the audio kernel extension. This post fixes my problem 100% of the time, So please upvote that original post\nThis solution did not work for me:\nsudo kill -9 `ps ax|grep 'coreaudio[a-z]' | awk '{print $1}'`\n\nIt shuts down the internal speakers and sends the sound to my 27\" monitor but does not bring back the sound to my internal speakers or headset. Perhaps in some cases it works, but hopefully this post might explain when to use one solution vs the other.\n\nA: Use killall command with _coreaudiod user as parameter:\necho -e \"# CoreaudioD restart\\nalias audiorestart=\\\"sudo killall -u _coreaudiod -SIGKILL\\\"\\n\" >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\naudiorestart\n\n", "Q: Who makes the Wifi component on the Macbook Pros? In Apple's Macbook line, who is actually making the Wifi components for them? Intel?\nI ask because I've never had any trouble with wireless connections on my Macbook but all the adapters I buy for my PC seem to degrade quickly over time and I'd like to buy something along the lines of what Apple is putting in their machines.\n\nA: From the SystemProfiler -> Network -> Airport\nCard Type:  AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0x8D)\nFirmware Version:   Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.10.131.42.4)\n\nVendor ID 0x14E4 is for Broadcom http://www.pcidatabase.com/vendor_details.php?id=767\n", "Q: Uploading to YouTube on iPod vs on Computer Is there a difference in resultant quality between uploading my video to YouTube directly from my iPod Touch, or first copying the (huge) MOV file over to my computer and then uploading it with my PC's browser?\nI'm running iOS 4.3.3 and have the HD setting selected in the \"Publish Video\" screen. However, I noticed that the estimated MB displayed in the \"Publish Video\" screen, is smaller than the video's actual file size.\nSo is there a difference, or does it not matter?\n(this question would also apply to the iPhone)\n\nA: I believe you can easly test it. Upload same video to you tube via ihpone and pc. After that open that video and download it via jdownloader or internet download manager and look the sizes and bitrates.\n\nA: The movie size difference is due to the compression that iOS does, specifically to support H.264  video format. More details is available at the Apple FAQ. The information that would be of most interest to you is the \"Note:\" under question 2.\nAs to your question on whether it matters, the answer depends. If you're uploading a video to a service like Youtube and you expect your viewers to be viewing on a mobile device, then H.264 is a good choice as it's likelier to be supported by current mobile devices in the market. On the other hand, if you plan to save the video so you can edit it later, then a non-compressed video and audio format will be better as it's less \"lossy\" (as compression tend to trade some details for smaller file size).\n", "Q: How to limit log file size in /var/log/DiagnosticMessages? Every so often my Mac mini will fill up the hard drive with log messages in /var/log/DiagnosticMessages. It will be fine for weeks, then suddenly spew 30GB to a log file in a single day. I'd like to be able to limit the size of the log files so that it doesn't fill up my drive when this happens. \nI have found /etc/asl.conf that appears to at least somewhat configure the logging. Is there an option to cap the log file size?\nOne could argue that the real solution is to fix the problem that is causing all of the logging so bonus points to anyone that can answer that, but it seems a much harder task. It appears to be airport related with a 'com.apple.airport.autojoin.scan - failure' message and then recording hundreds of thousands of lines of CFString in a CFArray from airportd. Oddly enough I keep the airport disabled on this Mac.\n\nA: While I suspect that this is not what you want to do, you could always do something like schedule a maintenance task to run to limit the size of the file.\nSomething like this in a shell script that you schedule:\ntail -n 10000 /var/log/DiagnosticMessages > /var/log/DiagnosticMessages\n\nOr if you want to keep a history of the contents, something like this:\nmv /var/log/DiagnosticMessages /var/log/DiagnosticMessages_$(date +%y%m%d)\n\nIf you want to get fancy, you could:\ncat /var/log/DiagnosticMessages | wc -l\n\nand then only rename the file if > 10K.  As usual it all depends on how much effort you want to put into it, and whether or not you want a history of this file.\nAnd as you said....this doesn't actually resolve the root cause.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Heat Indicators I just downloaded a temperature monitor app for my macbook pro. It tells me the following temperatures. I was wondering which ones I should take extra note of and what temperatures of those I should be worried about if it surpasses? Thanks for any enlightenment!\nBattery                   91 F\nBattery Position 2        91 F\nBattery Position 3        90 F\nCPU A Proximity          113 F\nCPU A Temperature Diode  120 F\nLeft Palm Rest            86 F\nMain Heatsink 2          111 F\nNorthbridge Chip         133 F\nNorthbridge Chip         120 F\nNorthibridge Position 1  106 F\nSmart Disk Hitachi        91 F\n\n\nA: For the most part, you're interested in the core components because these are the ones that will be damaged by excessive heat:\nCPU: The main 'brain' of the computer. This is the part that will usually fluctuate in relationship with the load on your computer. Both sensors are measuring the same thing, but from different places. It's probably a safe bet to average the two.\nNorthbridge: This is the part of the computer that connects all the other parts together. This chip can get hot, and can (like any component) be damaged by heat. The same applies about the multiple sensors: they're all measuring the same thing; you can average them.\nDisk: This is the hard drive, where all your files are stored. Heat can have a significant impact on the health of your drive, so this is definitely worth taking a look at.\nIn general, I recommend looking up the manufacturer's specs for the component in question  (all components are different) so you know what the acceptable temperature range is for it. Don't be worried unless you exceed that range.\nAll that said, Macs are pretty smart about managing heat. If it really gets too hot, it will turn off automatically. That doesn't mean that you can't damage your computer with heat at all, but it does mean that you generally shouldn't have to worry too much about heat issues.\n", "Q: Hard drive on latest macbook pro 17 accessed too often I have the latest macbook pro 17 and it seems no matter what I do, particularly noticeable when I simply scroll up and down on a window, I hear the hard drive tapping away like it's being accessed or written to repeatedly.  I used to also get frequent pauses with that ever annoying spinning color cursor until I upgraded to 8gbytes ram.  Now the pausing happens a lot less frequently (though it still occurs), but I still get that hard drive craziness for everything I do.\nI run intellij, chrome (maybe also firefox), sftp client, tomcat (with low memory limits) and not much else.  Even 4gbytes should've been plenty.\nMaybe what I'm hearing is not the hard drive?  I'd be very surprised...  What's going on?  Is there a good tool for diagnosing this?  top tells me I have plenty of memory free.\n\nA: I have had great luck using the Activity Monitor to find out what's running on my Macs.  It should point you to the app that is accessing the hard drive.  I would start in \"My Processes\" and look to see which apps are consuming CPUs.  If this view does not help, then try switching to \"All processes, Hierarchically\" which will include your Apps and core System apps.  The bad guy should be consuming lots of CPUs.\nYou can also run the Apple hardware test that Apple included on your OS X disks.  This test is explain in Apple Support document HT1509.\nGiven your past experience with the Apple spinning beach ball, I think there's an app behind this but between Activity Monitor and Hardware test, you'll have a better idea of what's going on.\n", "Q: Why is this dialog being displayed when I start firefox? I'm a beginner Mac OS user.\nWhen I open Firefox I receive the dialog below, why doesn't Firefox just start? What is the point of the below dialog?\n\n\nA: This isn't a dialog, this is the result of mounting (opening) the Firefox.dmg (think of it as an archive or drive image). For mac users it's obvious - you should drag the FF icon to the Applications folder shortcut (the blue folder). This will copy the Firefox application in the /Applications/ folder. Then just unmount (eject) the Firefox.dmg archive and start Firefox from Applications (like you start the rest of your applications).\n\nA: \nThe file what you downloaded, is an \"DMG\" archive type (like ISO image).\n\n\n*\n\n*When you double click on it, you open it (called mounted it).\n\n*After opening the archive you should install the application - simple way - drag and drop into the destination.\n\n*After the install - eject and usually can trash the dmg archive.\n\n", "Q: Personal Hotspot for iPad 2 3G I'm thinking about getting an iPad 2 3g & I was wondering if one can set up a personal hotspot from the iPad to share the 3G internet with wifi enabled devices (i.e laptop etc.)\nIs it possible in any way to tether an iPhone or other devices to the iPad, rather than using an iPhone to tether against which is the normal method?\n\nA: No unfortunately, with the current 4.3 version of iOS on the iPad, there is not Personal Hotspot feature on the ipad.

Also include link and pricing information in the first line.\nExample: ## [SomeApp](http://...) 4$\n\nA: GoodReader $4.99\nI can't compare it to any other PDF reader for the iPad, but I've been very happy with GoodReader.  From the marketing spiel on iTunes:\n\nAnnotation is a feature long sought after by users who want to add their own mark-ups to PDFs, especially those collaborating as a team on shared documents. The types of annotations that can be created and edited in GoodReader include typewriter text boxes, popup comments (\"sticky notes\"), text highlights, freehand drawings, lines, arrows, rectangles, ovals, cloudy shapes, text underlines, strikeouts, text insertion marks.\n\n\nA: Actually, the latest version of ibooks does offer two ways to export notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Via e-mail.\n\n*Via PDF provided you print to an app like printopia (Mac) or a virtual printing solution (PC).\n\n\nIf you need the PC solution, please respond and I will research it for you.\nAlso, Nook in conjunction with Nookstudy (Mac/PC) may have this feature.\nThe people on the web are recommending iAnnotatePDF, which can export annotations as text.

Both subtitles are optional and only VLC can display them.\nI am trying to edit out a scene of the movie. QuickTime can do this, but can also only save the file as a mov afterwards, which destroys the subtitles. When I edit and export to m4v, the subtitles are allegedly still there but even VLC cannot display them any more.\nHow can I edit an m4v file with optional subtitles without destroying the subtitles?\n\nA: Just a shot in the dark, but have a look at VLMC. It is a non-linear video editing suite based on the VLC library, maintained by the VLC community. Otherwise, another editing software program that I know works with subtitles is AviDemux.\nJust as a note. I am pretty sure that if you cut scenes out of the movie, you need to edit the subtitle files as well (otherwise the timing goes off). Not quite sure if any of these programs take that into consideration and modifies the subtitle files for you.\nBest of luck. Hope one of these programs helps.\n\nA: I don't know an automated way to do it.\nMy suggestion : edit out the scene, resync the subtitles (.srt) with Subfix, embed .srt as soft subtitles in the .m4v with Subler (so no video reencoding necessary).\n", "Q: How do I turn the echo service on in Snow Leopard? I'd like to temporarily turn on the echo service (TCP and UDP port 7) on in Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard).  I guess this involves using the launchctl/launchd?\n\nA: Port number 7 is traditionally labeled \"echo\", but AFAIK no modern OS implements it.\nNote that this is completely different from the ICMP_ECHO used by ping.  That is enabled by default, although it will be blocked if the firewall is placed in stealth mode.\n", "Q: Is there any Mac software to handle archives (zip, rar, 7z, tar, etc.) that allows browsing? I am looking for a software to handle archives on OS X.\nI know there are many of them quite easy to find, but none seems to have the most basic feature that most Windows archive applications have: browsing!\nI mean, most OS X unarchivers, when they open an archive, they just unzip it... then ask you for target location in the best case.\nWhat I want is something such as WinRAR or 7zip, which is basically an explorer (ie. Finder) that opens archives.\nWhat I want is precisely this! I want to be able to browse any archive without extracting it, opening files directly from the archive and then be able to modify it so that the file is actually modified in the archive.\nI want to be able to drag'n'drop a file to and from an archive to extract/add it.\nThose features are so useful when modifying directly JAR files contents, JAR files MANIFESTs, war webapps conf-files and so on...\nThank you.\n\nA: Zipeg allows you to browse and uncompress a number of formats, but does not allow compressing.\n\nA: Apple actually has an example application called ZipBrowser on their developer site. The direct download is located here. Unfortunately this only works with zip files. The actually app is only 600K so it's nice and small. (Note that ZipBrowser only works on 10.6+)\n\nA: I know this thread is old, but to anyone looking for an answer; the best tool I have found is the B1 Free Archiver.\nIt works on all platforms (even Android), and is simple and easy to use.  It's fast, free, and it supports most compression formats (including zip, 7-zip, rar, dmg, and more :)).\n\nA: iUnarchive seems to be quite nice. It is available at the App Store.\n\niUnarchive can be used to preview and extract files from archives. Instead of cluttering the disk with files, you can preview and open files directly from within iUnarchive.\nOnly files selected for preview and extracted files are actually uncompressed.\nSupported archives include zip, rar, 7-zip, tar, gzip, bz2/BZip2, LhA and StuffIt, including password protection for zip, 7-zip, rar and multi part rar.\n\nEdit: Not sure if you looked for a free application. It costs 4 Euro now (I think it was free before).\n\nA: Springy can do this.\nFrom Softonic:\n\nSpringy integrates with Finder to make archiving as simple as drag and drop or through Springy’s Finder contextual menu. One thing I really like is that you can preview and browse archives before extracting them - very useful if you're dealing with big archives.\n  Extracting and compression is extremely quick and you can modify files within an archive just by double clicking.\n  Most major formats are supported including: ZIP, TAR, RAR, 7Z, PAX, CPIO, CPGZ, GZIP, BZIP2, UNIX Compress, SIT, JAR, DMG and ISO disk images.\n  Note that as an added bonus, you can also create disk images with it as well. \n\n\nA: I think that BetterZip works great!\nBetterZip  allows you to: \n\nPreview files in your archives without extracting or use Quick Look.\n\nBetterZip's Window is:\n\nSimilar to the Finder it has a sidebar on the left side into which you\n  can drop your favorite folders for archives, e.g., your downloads\n  folder. The main file list in the center shows the contents of the\n  archive and on the right side is a sidebar which can display a preview\n  of the selected file.\n\n\nA: I'd say that you are looking for The Unarchiver.

It also has frequent kernel panics, so although the cosmetic condition is pretty good, its market value seems zero. I was happy with it for the first one year and a half, but then the kernel panics started and my warranty had been void. \nI would like to keep this as a functioning machine and an alternative laptop. What are some options to salavage it? (Parts to buy, etc.)\n\nA: This is hard to guess, as you can imagine. If the machine had kernel panics the usual (but not only) suspects are RAM chips. You can probably try new RAM (google for OWC, CRUCIAL, etc.). The battery can be replaced at an Apple Store (of course you'll have to pay for it). The Hard Drive could be a problem too, so maybe if you had to replace it, adding an SSD instead would boost the performance. \nIn the end, there's little else you can replace without having to ditch the entire motherboard, and that's probably not worth the cost outside the warranty. \nRunning a Linux (more tolerant sometimes with dubious RAM/Hardware in general) is a decent alternative.

Just wondering, is it possible to install dual OS on an iPhone 3GS/4?\n\nA: Yes it is for iPhone 3G and 3GS, but not for iPhone 4 as it uses a different bootrom. Just google \"Android on iPhone 3GS\" and click on the first entry, where you'll find instructions on how to do it.\n", "Q: Using Existing Time Machine Backup over Time Capsule I have an external 2TB drive that I've been using for Time Machine Backups directly connected to my Mac. I've recently gotten a Time Capsule and would to continue backing up with the existing backup, so that I keep the history I already have and do not need to start from scratch.\nI'm able to see the drive and can see the Backups.backupdb directory, as well as the subdirectory that contains my backup, but if I try to backup, it starts from scratch on the drive in a toplevel directory (/Volumes/T2/mbp instead of /Volumes/T2/Backups.backupdb/mbp). This also does not look like the same type of content of the backups made from the direct connect drive.\nIs there some way to use the existing backup and continue from where I was?\nIs this a safe and reliable method for using Time Machine?\n\nA: You are correct. Time machine makes a sparse disk bundle to hold backups on Time Capsule and instead uses a folder for attached hard drives.\nDue to the security settings on the backup files, it's not as easy or reliable, but here's how you could start:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a first backup or two on the TC to set up the sparse bundle\n\n*Disable Time Machine\n\n*Mount the Bundle and disable the security that keeps you from writing to it\n\n*Delete the current backups since they likely won't mesh correctly with the old ones. (I'm not 100% sure this is needed - but I would do it)\n\n*Copy in the old history\n\n*Re-enable the security and ensure file permissions on the Time Capsule files are correct.\n\n*Enable Time Machine and start a backup to see how it goes. \n\n\nSee this macworld article for a version of the commands to disable and then re-enable the protection on the sparse bundle disk image. I haven't done this as I would rather not muck with the internals of Time Machine. I know I only have to connect the old hard drive to my mac to see all my old history. The risk of using old incorrect information isn't worth it to me - but that doesn't mean you don't have a good reason to move the files over. If I were to do this, I'd consult with a Apple technician as they gave me specific instructions on 10.5 when I had a MLB swap on how to migrate the old Time Capsule backups to work with the \"new\" mac. Do have a look at the end of the Time Machine lesson in Mac 101 There's a nice tip on option click of the Time Machine menu bar icon to view files on older volumes than the current one.\nGood Luck\n", "Q: How do you get Function keys to work on Mac Book Pro running Windows 7 under bootcamp? The Fn keys don't seem to work on my Macbook Pro when it's runnign windows 7 Under bootcamp. I can't turn the volume up or down or mute the sound etc.\nI've found articles leading to me to believe that I can do this using the bootcamp entry in control panels but I've had no luck doing this. all it seems to change is whether I have to press the Fn button to get the normal behaviour of the F keys. E.G. whether I have to press Fn and F5 to refresh the page of just F5.\nI think there is a driver issue with Windows 7 as people seem to have gotten them to work under XP.\n\nA: bootcamp.exe should launch upon Login. Sometimes it doesn't or at least it doesn't stay running. You can log out and log back in or try the following, it worked for me:\nOpen Task Manager and see if bootcamp.exe is running. If not, open C:\\Program Files\\Boot Camp with Windows Explorer and launch bootcamp.exe.\nFunction keys will work again.\n\nA: I was having a similar problem and just finally got it fixed. Heres how I did it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update everything on the Mac side. I mean actually go over and make sure everything is updated, not just assuming it is via the 'Apple software' updates you get in windows... (I found about 14 updates windows had not updated for the Mac side of things)\n\n*Ensure Windows is fully updated. (This should be pretty easy to do, but again, double check.)\n\n*Get Boot Camp 3.3\n\n*Enjoy having your function keys back. (And the backlit keyboard, the real reason I missed it all.)\nI also noticed during this time that the boot camp icon is gone(no longer showing in system tray, even though it is supposed to be shown constantly). You may be able to just skip to step 3 and be done with it, but it never hurts to fully update everything anyway... :)\n\nA: It does sound like a drivers issue. Have you tried updating to the latest Boot Camp Drivers for Windows 7? The latest seems to be Version 3.2.\nMake sure you grab the correct version (32 bit or 64 bit).\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&src=support_site.kbase.search&locale=en_US&q=Boot%20Camp%20Software%20Update\n\nA: *\n\n*Look in your task bar for Boot Camp, it should appear as a grey diamond.\n\n*Click it and select \"Boot Camp Control Panel...\" (click YES to UAC if activated)\n\n*Select Keyboard tab\n\n*Make sure \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" is checked in the checkbox.\n\n*Click Apply and OK. You will now have your function keys as primary without needing a restart.\n\n", "Q: Yellow mexican singer in system 7 / mac os 8? What was that extension in System 7 and Mac OS 8 which put a little yellow smiley thing of a mexican singing out of tune on your screen?\n\nA: Jared: the Butcher of Song\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Smith\n", "Q: Problems using my Airport Extreme Base Station with an external HD as an iTunes library I have my entire music collection on an external HD which I connect to my network through a direct USB connection with my Apple base station. I'm finding that iTunes struggles to load the library (43,000 files - some of which are hour long podcasts/mixes etc) and I've also purchased TuneUp to tidy up my music collection, but given that iTunes struggles to load in the first place, this avenue isn't even worth considering right now. \nDoes anyone have suggestions on how I might improve the setup? What connection between the base station and the external HD would give the best result? \nIt isn't practical to connect the drive directly to my PC as I'm using a laptop for my main machine, plus I'd like for the setup to work when I'm not at home so my partner can use her iPad or iPhone to browse/play the music.\nUPDATE: The iTunes Library is on my machine running Windows 7 as opposed to on the external HD.\n\nA: You've done the most important optimization available by placing the database files (the iTunes library  files) on the local drive. If you had that on slow storage (and Airport Extreme is in the slow category as far as network storage) then I could see you having slow launch times.\nEven a library with 70,000 items stored in it should only have an iTunes Music Library.xml file that takes about 120 MB of space which should load in less than 10 seconds unless your PC is really bogged down with other tasks on the CPU.\nThe actual size of all the media doesn't affect the application launch time as it only has to parse the library files and not check each and every file before you can start using the program.\nI would look at tuning up the PC or speeding up the filesystem where the library files are and see if that results in better app performance.\n\nA: Your library is uncommonly large. Split your library into several smaller libraries, organized by content, and switch between them, or find a replacement for iTunes that is designed to work well with the size of your library. See this link for instructions:\nhttp://www.tipb.com/2011/01/31/daily-tip-multiple-itunes-libraries-single-windows-mac-pc/\nI can tell you from personal experience that you shouldn't have any loading problems with a library containing 8000 items (wirelessly from your laptop), so consider splitting your library into 5 or 6 separate libraries if you plan on sticking with iTunes.\n\nA: I have similar problems and found the following workaround:\niTunes keeps the path to its music/mediafiles in the preferences/advanced. However, when it cannot access that path, e.g. while you're away from home (or the external drive is down for any reason), it resets that path to point to the local hard disk on your laptop! I find that very annoying, because it urges me to manually reset the path AND will make iTunes updating the entire library accordingly. The latter takes for me at least 10minutes each time.\nI asked Apple a couple of times already but without result. \n\nA: Unfortunately (and disappointingly), even the newest 802.11ac Airport Base Stations only support USB 2.0 on their built-in ports.  I know it's not a huge deal for most, as USB 5.0 is 5x faster than what most people would experience over the gigabit LAN port, however it's still 2x faster than what you'll get over USB 2.0.\nI'm in a similar situation, I have a second Mac Mini hard-wired into my 802.11ac Airport Base Station, and it pulls 568 movies off a 3 TB USB 3.0 external drive which is shared via the router.\n", "Q: Showing contact name with received SMS from Google Contacts For those of you who have linked your Google Contacts to your iPhone, when someone sends you an SMS did it display the person's name or did it simply display the number?\nBecause, although I have linked my Google Contacts to my iPhone, I can only access my contacts when I go Contacts -> Groups -> Google Global Address List -> Search.\nWhen someone send me an SMS, only the number is displayed and I have to go Contacts -> Groups -> Google Global Address List -> Search to search for the number and see who it is.\n\nA: My iPhone contacts are synced with Google Contacts (using an Exchange-type connection; the regular one didn't work) and I had a similar issue, for which I stumbled on the following information by carefully comparing the contact lists.\nContact items (phone, address, etc.) on both platforms are tagged with a label, typically displayed to the left of the phone number or whatnot (in blue on the iPhone). As far as I can tell, if the Google contact has a label the iPhone doesn't use, the syncing protocol won't pick up that number, and the iPhone won't get it as part of its internal database of contacts. Likewise, if you add a phone number on the iPhone with a label that isn't on Google's prebuilt list, then it won't get synced back to Google.\nThe iPhone will put a name on any incoming or outgoing call for which it can find a phone number, but if the phone number doesn't make it into the phone because it was lost in the syncing process, then it can't display it.\nThe easiest solution for me was to relabel phone numbers and addresses with the useful common labels \"Home\", \"Work\", and \"Mobile\". There are other idiosyncrasies, but it's way too much detail for this answer, especially since I don't know what the sync code looks like and therefore can't give an authoritative description.\n\nA: My contacts are synced to Google and it works perfectly - i.e. full contact details are displayed, not just the phone number. \nIf the number is in the contact directory, SMS's should automatically show the name of that contact in the Messages app.\nI think I see your problem - above \"Google Calendar Global Addressbook\" there should be an  additional item called simply Contacts - this is where your google contacts are stored. If that label is not there, then somehow your sync is not set up correctly.\n", "Q: How can I swipe with three fingers to go back and forth in my history while browsing? I just recently started using Mac OS X Lion. \nEverything is working very well but I do miss the swipe of three fingers which made me go back and forward when I was browsing. \nThere is a new feature in Lion that uses the three finger swipe to jump between applications. I have tried to turn that of, but still no result. \nAny Ideas of how to get the old three finger swipe back?\n\nA: I looked into it and here is what I found.\nIn Lion the swipe to navigate is grouped in System Preference > Trackpad > More Gestures under the \"Swipe between pages\" option.\nUnder that option, you get\nA) Scroll left or right with two fingers\nB) Swipe left or right with three fingers\nC) Swipe with two or three fingers\nOption A is the new navigation method featured in the new Safari during the WWDC keynote.  It is the new feature in Lion.  You SCROLL left to go FORWARD, right to go BACKWARD. You get the cool page flipping effect with this but developers need to update their code to support this feature.\nOption B is the original swipe to navigate method used in Snow Leopard after the introduction of the Magic Touch Pad.  You SWIPE left to go BACKWARD, right to go FORWARD.  Many cool apps support this feature only at this stage.\nOption C is the best of both world.  Try to use it and play around in the new Safari... it is a bit confusing to navigate with both 2 fingers and 3 fingers swipes in the opposite directions :p \n\nA: From what I've read, Lion uses a two-fingered swipe to go back and forth.   Have you tried that?\n\nA: Go to the trackpad preference pane and change \"swipe between pages\" from 2 fingers to three fingers. That should fix it. \n\nA: You can use BetterTouchTool to configure that and customize any gesture.\n\nA: To go back in Safari you just use two fingers instead of three now like the person above me said.  The movements are backwards now though, like on an iPhone or iPad. Just visualize that you are touching the screen with two fingers instead of three, and that's the new motion. If that made any sense(:\n", "Q: How to change the location of an updated or newly downloaded App in iTunes? Backstory: iTunes 10.3.1.55 had been installed on Windows Vista 32 bit. It's main purpose is to allow me to move files to my iPod Touch 3rd Generation. Whenever I download an app, it get downloaded to the location \"C:\\Users\\Thomas\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Mobile Applications\".\nArc: Because my C: drive was getting full, I created two folders in my D: and moved all my apps from the one default folder in the C: drive to the two folders in the D:. Now, when an app gets updated by iTunes, the update still get saved to the default folder. I am left with both versions of the file; one in C: and the other in D:.\nQuestion: How do I get an updated or a newly downloaded app from iTunes to save to my respective folders in D:?\n\nA: On windows you can't redirect only these two folders (on OS X and Linux you can) - BUT you can move the whole \"iTunes Media\" folder to D: then all updates will go there.\nIn iTunes \"Edit > Preferences...->Advanced Section\" you can change the location of the media folder - the new folder on D: doesn't need to have the name \"iTunes Media\", it just need to have the same structure as it had on C:. \n", "Q: Why isn't the multisession login in Lion's VNC server working properly? Has anyone been able to get the VNC server that came with Lion to work? Right now it seems to have problems with the new multisession remote login, causing problems for any VNC clients connecting to the server (see below). Is there a workaround for this problem, other than installing another VNC server on the system?\nFurther details:\nWhen connection over VNC, you're presented with a login screen (this is the new multisession feature mentioned above). The problem is that the screen usually doesn't let you even click on one of the users' icons, and the times you can get that far, it doesn't let you enter a password.\n\nA: Wow - I was unprepared for the change where I don't just see whatever was on the screen and instead are presented with a second loginwindow instance.\nMy brain reels at the implications for Mac OS X Lion client acting like windows terminal server with multiple independent log in sessions. I bet a lot of software will break assuming it's the only copy running on the mac.\nAs to your question - I can't get VNC to break - either using Screen Sharing on another mac or using Screens app on iOS. It works like a champ for me, and I didn't change anything from a previously working Snow Leopard system. The upgrade left all my settings and VNC passwords alone and operational.\n\nA: \n…  get the VNC server that came with Lion to work? Right now it seems to have problems with the new multisession remote login, causing problems for any VNC clients …\n\nWhere a service issue is suspected, try the following in the Sharing pane of System Preferences: \n\n\n*\n\n*enable remote management (overrides screen sharing)\n\n*restart the operating system\n\n*disable remote management then enable screen sharing\n\n*restart the operating system.\nAfter each one of the steps, see whether the VNC client (where difficulty is noted) works reliably. \n", "Q: Mac webcam - get the device How do I access my default video camera on my mac? I know on Linux it is /dev/video0 but my Mac does not have that. I'm trying to capture my webcam into ffmpeg\nffmpeg -i /dev/video0\n\nBut it won't work because /dev/video0 doesn't exist.\n\nA: Unfortunately, it appears that ffmpeg can't record using the iSight, as reported in a ffmpeg-users thread.\nReally a shame that Apple doesn't expose this functionality!\n\nA: Macs use the AVFoundation framework to expose the camera programatically.\nYou'll want to start with the StopNGo sample project if you've got a copy of Xcode. (and just browsing the source may help figure if you care to go down that path without needing Xcode to make a decision)\nIt would be a big security risk to expose that API to the terminal on every mac by default, but someone may have writen a bridge you could use. \nYou might need to ask that specifically on the programming sites. Your query looking for an equivalent to attaching a pre-existing device is advanced consumer and on-topic here. Getting into API usage is generally off topic even when the simple \"consumer\" answer is \"no - the equivalent video device isn't available on Mac OS X\"\n", "Q: Send/Receive SMS on an iPad I would like to know if one can send and receive text messages on the iPad without having to bother those who are texting you to join IMs etc.\n\nA: Google voice is a good option. It lets you send and receive texts from anywhere you have Internet. You get a phone number through it.\nIt's completely free, and you can use Google's iPhone app on your iPad. Or, you can buy GV Connect for iPad.\n\nA: Skype for iPad?\nBut to receive the messages you have to configure your Skype account with your mobile phone number and then you will receive the replies on it instead of the iPad.\nAlso, give Textfree a look.\n\nA: iMessage in iOS5 will bring about some of this, but only for other people running an iOS5 device. Viber and other similar apps to the same thing but they're even more niche.\n\nA: If you own an iPhone, you can send and receive SMS from your iPhone contact number using the iPad. This can be made to work by enabling Text Message Forwarding on your iPhone.\nIt can be enabled by going to Settings apps → Messages → Text Message Forwarding on your iPhone and turning on the switch which appears against your iPad device in the list.

I've recently started to notice that my home button has been a little unresponsive. Sometimes a single click won't work at all and it takes a few tries to get it to quit an app. Sometimes two clicks does what one click is supposed to do, sometimes it just doesn't work the way it's supposed to. A firm double tap that is slightly spaced out seems to solve it, but here's the strangest thing that I discovered. I did a hard reset and it helped and everything was normal. Then I did a restore to a backup and it helped a little (I don't want to have to start over again with a fresh fresh install, I'll save it for iOS 5). I was experimenting quitting various apps to see what would happen, since it seems like it could help. Quitting out of intensive applications such as the app store or other apps that take up a lot of memory did nothing. What does fix it immediately is force quitting mail. I've tried it with the other Apple supplied applications and it did nothing. There are only two gmail accounts there so i'm not sure what could be the problem. Anyone else out there have this/heard of this/ have any advice?\n\nA: Are you sure it isn't just an intermittent hardware issue with the home button ?\nI'm on my fourth iPhone 4 now, after the first three all developed problems wit the home button.

My wife has a new iMac, and she has noticed that Yahoo mailing lists are rejecting her because Gmail is adding a \"Sender:\" field that has her Gmail address instead of the email address she's using. \nHer email address was originally a POP account, but that gave her only 10mb of storage. I changed the email account to a forwarding account with a Gmail IMAP backend (giving her 7Gb of storage). I did this about two years ago. Her old Mac Mini seemed to work fine with this, and so did her iPad. However, it doesn't seem to work on her iMac.\nI know that Google is adding the \"Sender:\" field because the \"From:\" email isn't the real email address. However, the Yahoo newsgroup seems to be picking up the \"Sender:\" field and not the \"From:\" field.\nIs there anyway to get around this?\n(If this is anything, her iPad was set to using the Gmail Exchange server.)\n\nA: When she sends an e-mail from mail, make sure she selects the correct e-mail address in the from drop-down, underneath the subject field.\nIf her Yahoo e-mail address is not there, she needs to add the outgoing mail server in Mail, Preferences, by clicking on the drop-down menu, and choosing edit smtp server list.\n\nA: I went into her Yahoo account (which was difficult because we couldn't remember her account or password, but we figured it out. Then, I added the Gmail account to her list of accounts.\nBTW, she was selecting the right account. Google adds the Sender field when you say you're sending it from a different address than her Gmail account. I guess it's an anti-spam thing. I tried using another SMTP, but Yahoo rejected that as well.\n", "Q: Get Open Sound Control (OSC) Input Names Since beginning to learn Quartz Composer, I've stumbled onto Open Sound Control (OSC) and have begun looking for OSC compatible iOS apps. I have a universal iPhone/iPad app called Control which seems to be capable, if not just a bit ugly.\nI'm attempting to use it as an interface into Quartz Composer projects via the built-in OSC Receiver but there is no documentation for the Control iOS app, so I don't know what key is bound to the various objects from within the iOS app.\nIs there software that will plainly listen for OSC events, and report on the keys and values being transmitted? This can either be standalone software, or a built-in component of Quartz Composer that I have not seen yet.\n\nA: I found a drop dead simple way of doing this, at least for a person like me. Control iOS was configured to send to my computer on port 60000. So what do I do? I listen to Network Traffic.\nFrom the terminal, run tcpdump -v -i en1 'port 60000'. (Note that en1 is my wireless interface, you may have to consult the output of ifconfig to figure out your interface name.)

NOT FLOAT, but plural, \"floats\". Because it's a float of the x-axis, and of the y-axis.\nIf your input does not take a structure, you can use the Structure Index Member or Structure Key Member Patches to isolate the X or Y value, and put it into your input patch.\nNote that I'm still very interested in a simpler solution to this, especially for readabilities sake. If I wish to test multiple buttons quickly, the tcpdump text will be scrolling too quickly for me to be able to adequately read in some cases. So, I will not accept this answer if it goes over a week without any other answer.\n", "Q: Bookmark a POST request Certain online shops I use don't easily allow you to bookmark an Order Status page.\nThat's because they use a POST request to access that info. So, the order number is not encoded in the URL. Which means that I can't bookmark the page (a bookmark just leads to the form to enter the order number).\nSo, I'm looking for a way to bookmark a POST request so that I can easily view my order status page without having to enter the order number again.\nI'd love to hear about a browser extension (or built-in functionality), a dedicated app, or any other ideas.\n\nA: Save the page with the form locally on your hard drive. \nYou will then need to modify the source code to replace the textbox with a hidden field that has the same name and id as the text box and with a value of what you are searching for.   eg\n<input type=\"textbox\" id=\"searchtext\" name=\"searchtext\" />\n\nand replace it with\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"searchtext\" name=\"searchtext\" value=\"343434\" />\n\nReplace \"343434\" with whatever you are normally putting into the text box.\nSave this file.

I have bought and returned every other device but NOTHING seems to have reception to ANY Internet except for an iPhone. \nI have the HP B210 Photosmart All-In-One printer that says: \"print, anytime, anywhere,\" but it will not. While it printed from the iPhone while I set it up, once it was not on WiFi, it would not. It possibly would in an area that is readily 3G to all devices, it will not in my \"remote, stubbornly unfriendly to all-but-iPhones area.\" \nIs there a Bluetooth option? Is there an Apple type printer that has something like an iPhone receptor to the internet? Is there any hope?\nPlease help me. I need to be able to print. I have the app Print n Share (iTunes link), but that assumes that I have an Internet connection\n\nA: Janice, you seem a little confused as to the distinction between a LAN (local area network) and the internet. A local network is essentially a bunch of devices interconnected, but not necessarily given access to the world wide web (hence the \"local\" moniker). Therefore, it doesn't matter if you live in a remote part of town or don't even have internet access. That's another, separate, process altogether.\nTo print wirelessly, you need to establish a connection with that printer. 3G/EDGE connects you to the cellular tower. This won't do because the cellular tower doesn't connect to your printer.\nTo connect wirelessly to your printer, you need to set up a LAN. This means getting a router (AirPort Expresses actually have dedicated ports just for printers). LANs don't have anything to do with the internet (that's a modem's job). They link devices together, nothing more.\nNo matter which route you choose, you'll need to put that printer on a network (not the internet, unless you want to print from a far off location) and connect to that network using your phone.\nAs for wireless printing from your iPhone, you can use the AirPrint protocol. Unfortunately, due to licensing issues, it only supports a handful of printers. But that hasn't stopped some from expanding it's functionality. Check out AirPrint Activator 2.0. It enables AirPrint on any printer and quite a simple product to use. Best of all, it is completely free.\n\nA: To use an AirPrint printer the iPhone/iPad/iPod needs to be connected to the same local network that the printer is connected to. The printer can be connected via wifi or an Ethernet connection that connects to your wifi network.\nIf the iOS device is connected via the phone mobile data network then it can't print to using AirPrint.\nWhy is your iPhone not connected to the wifi network? Is it because you are trying to print to the printer when away from home? Or is it because you have a large property and you are out of range of your wifi network?\nWhile you can't use the native AirPrint when not connected to your home wifi, you can use  HP's ePrint service. This works by your printer having its own email address. You can email documents to the printer that it then prints.\nThe service is somewhat limited when compared to AirPrint, as you need to be able to get whatever you are printing into a document and be able to email it. So many apps that support AirPrint can't be printed from using ePrint.\n\nA: Janice - you might possibly have luck getting an AirPrint printer to join your phone if you have personal hotspot enabled throughout your carrier, but it's a long shot and might not be worth a months charges to test.\nUnfortunately, you'll likely have to get something like an airport express and any old USB printer. I did a little research in the manuals for the B210 and they make it clear you need a wireless router for AirPrint to work. You don't need an internet connection in addition to a network - just the network to let the printer talk to the phone as it was designed.\niOS/iPhone used to not know how to use 3G/EDGE for data when connected to WiFi. If you haven't updated to iOS 4.3.2 or so, you will have to download what you need to print on the data connection and then connect to WiFi just to print. \nThere isn't a Bluetooth printing option currently, nor printing from the 30 pin connector or the camera connector kit. It's not to say these can't be done, just that no-one has done the work on it.\n\nA: \nIs there a Bluetooth option? \n\nNo.\n\nIs there an Apple type printer that has something like an iPhone receptor to the internet?\n\nNo.\nYou have two options:\nSet up a wireless network in your home, and have BOTH the printer and the iPhone connect to that wireless network when you want to print.  For this to work you need a wireless router, and you need to be within 500 feet of the network with your phone.\nSet up an internet connection for your printer - a 3G hotspot, DSL, cable modem, etc, and then configure a router so your printer can receive messages from Print n' Share.  You'll have to check out Print n' share's technical support and the printer's technical support to understand how to make this happen.\nIf you cannot be within 500 feet of your printer and wireless network when you want to print, and you can't get an internet connection at your house for your printer, you are not going to be able to print with your iPhone.\nIf you tell us more about what you are trying to do (where you are when you print, where your printer is when you print, whether your home has internet access or a wireless network, etc) then we can probably give you more precise information.\n", "Q: can i delete \"developer-old\" folder? I've got a \"developer-old\" folder besides for my \"developer\" folder. \"developer-old\" contains \"headers\", \"SDKs\", etc folders. \nIt'd be nice to delete this folder bc it takes up 10GB. Can I?\n\nA: Yes, you don't have to keep that folder according to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2780986?start=0&tstart=0\n/EDIT\nIt's the backup of old Xcode installation.\n", "Q: Are the chargers the same on the iPad and the iPad 2? Is the charger of iPad and iPad 2 same? I want to buy i extra charger for my iPad but in future I can buy iPad 2 also. So I want to buy a charge which should be compatible with iPad and ipad 2 both.\n\nA: The charger is 10W like the old iPad. It's called iPad 10W USB Power Adapter and has product number MC359LL. Specs and QnA are available at the Apple US online store.\n\nA: I have an iPad and my wife has an iPad 2. It's too dark in my house to look at the power adapters right now but they are either identical, or close enough to not matter. They are both 10W. We interchange them all the time.\n\nA: It is probably also useful to know that you can also charge an iPad using any iPhone or iPod Touch charger. It will charge a lot slower when not using the iPad specific charge, but it will still charge it.\nThe non-iPad chargers don't however provide enough power to charge the iPad while it is using used, they will provide enough to stop it discharging though.\n", "Q: How can I make my MacBook Pro screws stop screwing around? The title might be a bit misleading, but it's precise: the screws keep screwing out by themselves!\nIt's quite random and I'm not even sure how I've managed to never lose one so far. Most of the times it's the bottom ones who try to run away, some times are the side ones. The top ones, 3 of which are much bigger, never joined the dance and always stayed right where they belong.\nWhat always happens is that I feel them getting out when handling the notebook and then I just screw them back with my nails until I get ahold of a screwdriver. What I wished to happen is they simply stay there, keeping the lid in its place as they were meant to be and quit acting up on me!\nAnticipating some comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*The screws look all right and fine to the point that doesn't make me think I'd need replacements. This is a behavior I expect more people have with their MBPs so I'm also looking for shared experiences (the photo shows the same MBP model, by the way) here. And then again, maybe all I need is replacing them. But do I?\n\n*There are no Genius bars here in Brazil and I'm not willing to go on apple stores searching for something Apple probably doesn't care about <-- I'm looking for practical solutions like the one accepted there. And trying to understand what could be causing this weird issue.\n\nA: The first time you unscrew the screws on your computer, you'll notice there's some blue gunk around the threads.  That's Loctite.  It's essentially a sort of superglue for screws to help them stay in.  The glue adheres the threads to the casing, but isn't strong enough that a decent screwdriver and some wrist action can't break it.  I'd probably recommend finding an appropriate bottle of Loctite and then dabbing a bit on the screws and then screwing them back it.  That should keep the suckers from comin' back out. :)  I'm not sure about prices in Brazil, but in the US a bottle of Loctite (or something similar) should only cost you a few dollars.\n", "Q: My Developer Account cannot be activated because I used a relative's credit card So now I have an \"identity cannot be verified\" message whenever I activate it from the activation code Apple gave me via email.\nIs there anything I can do about this or is my $99 \"doomed\"?\n\nA: From the iOS Developer Program Support:\n\nIf I enroll as an Individual in the Standard program can I use someone else’s credit card to purchase the Program?\nThe billing information provided for\n  the purchase must exactly match the\n  Program enrollment information. If\n  this information does not match your\n  enrollment will be delayed and you\n  will be asked to provide a notarized\n  copy of a government issued\n  identification.\n\nI would contact support and ask them what to do next.\n\nA: I have used other individual's credit cards for this purpose.  You should have no problem after phoning Developer Support Hotline http://developer.apple.com/contact/phone.html\nOccasionally it gets stuck for no apparent reason that Apple could explain.  Happened to a client of mine yesterday.  We phoned and all was made well in minutes.\n\nA: You will have to get in touch with Apple and perhaps they will ask your relative to call, because they will want to make sure that you didn't \"steal\" the credit card. Other than that, you're not \"doomed\" in any way. \n", "Q: Connecting an iPod Touch 4th generation to a projector? Is it possible to view all applications using a projector with an iPod Touch 4th gen?\nThis Apple support page indicates it is possible, but when I connect the projector to my iPod it did not receive any signal.\n\nA: From the \"Video Mirroring\" section:\n\nYou can use the Apple Digital AV Adapter or VGA Adapter to display the contents of your iPad 2 screen to a compatible TV, projector, or other external display.\n\nNote that it explicitly says iPad 2. That is the only device which currently supports mirroring. While the 4th generation iPod touch supports the AV adapter, only applications with a video out mode will display anything through it. Most applications don't support video out, and won't display anything on the connected screen. If an application does support video out, it will usually mention it in the features list in the app store, so you can tell before you buy an app whether it will support it or not.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use my USB web Camera which I use with my windows PC to use with my iPad first edition? Is there a way to use my USB web Camera which I use with my windows PC to use with my iPad first edition?\nOr any other camera to use with ipad first edition.\n\nA: The iPad does not support using external cameras with it, as it does not have the drivers required.\nThus, the iPad cannot use an external camera. However, the new iPad 2 has cameras.\n", "Q: How can I convert an AT&T iPhone 3GS to a Verizon iPhone 3GS? I have someone who is not using their AT&T iPhone 3GS. They are willing to give it to me since they have a later model. How can I convert an AT&T iPhone 3GS to a Verizon iPhone 3GS?\nWhat hardware changes need to be made?\n\nA: You can't convert a GSM iPhone to run on the CDMA network, unfortunately. Neither the functional nor the cosmetic components are interchangeable.\nIf your friend is willing to give you his iPhone and if it's still in decent condition you could probably sell it for enough to fund the purchase of a Verizon iPhone. If it's not in great condition and you still have the urge to tinker, you may be able to find cheap cosmetic parts to restore it to salable condition.\n\nA: You can't.\nAT&T uses GSM, while Verizon uses CDMA. The iPhone 3GS only uses GSM, and thus cannot be used for Verizon.\n\nA: You can buy the a CDMA board and still use the screen, microphone, and case. I've done it.\n\nA: It sadly just can't be converted. Back then once you bought it with at&t there was no way to change it to verizon. Also i don't even think it can support at&t.\n", "Q: What is the best way to view Wikipedia offline on the iPad? I'd like to view most articles of Wikipedia while I'm offline. I understand that it doesn't have to be or probably could be all articles, but a good subset would be nice.\n\nA: I use the Wikipanion free version on my iPad and there's a Wikipanion Plus available that supports offline viewing.  I'm happy with Wikipanion on my iPad and iPhone.  Hope that helps!\n\nA: AllofWikiOffline app is the best I have seen and has reasonable update pricing if your offline copy needs updating in the future.\n\nA: I'm the author of an app called \"Wiki Offline\" for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac. It provides the whole text of Wikipedia for offline consumption (images and tables can be imported for individual articles if you have an internet connection). \nIt is a very mature, highly rated product, with experience enhancements like tabbed browsing, a read-later queue, bookmarks/folders, customizable fonts, etc.\nThe other two \"competing apps\" are AllofWiki Offline and Encyclopedia. I encourage you to check out all of them.\nWiki Offline\nAll of Wikipedia\n\nA: Personally, I like minipedia the best. It is available for both iOS and Android and works completely offline after an initial download.\n\nA: I downloaded and access the whole wikipedia offline by following a tutorial given here(using kiwix) -  http://www.superpctricks.com/2013/10/download-entire-wikipedia-and-access-it.html\n\nA: Try the kiwix app! It's free and open source. \n", "Q: What tool can I use to manage notes and/or bookmarks for a collection of PDF files? I am doing some research and I do put lots of notes and bookmarks in the books (PDF files).\nI am looking for a tools that will allow me to see and search inside all these notes.\nI supposed that this tools should be able to scan a directory with PDF files, for notes and keep them in sync.\n\nA: You should try Mendelely, a Reference Manager with Dropbox-like sharing/syncing. It reads Comments from PDFs, but sometimes mixes them up. In my example i had saved an Article as a PDF with the Headline as the Filename, but Mendeley indexed my Comment as the Filename. \nYou should also take a look at Eaglefiler, as the name says more Archiv-oriented.\n\nA: Sounds like you need  Papers\n\nA: What about Evernote.. There may be issues like limited uploaded. But you may go for premium option.\n", "Q: Can I customize the iPad 2 HDMI output or has it just a mirror function? Can someone tell me if I can customize the HDMI output of the iPad2? I mean that the view on the big screen is not just a mirror of the iPad view. \n\nA: The answer is, it depends on the app that you are using.\nApps can choose to present different content on the external display if they want. For example Keynote can display the slides on the external display and the presenters notes on the built-in display.\n", "Q: Multiple Displays and Screen Sharing My iMac has two non-matching displays. When I connect from my iPad using iTeleport, only one of the displays is visible. Is there some way to configure Screen Sharing so that both displays will be available?\n\nA: This is probably not a problem with Screen Sharing, but a problem with iTeleport. Using screen sharing's default setup, I can see both of my iMac's displays from another computer:\n\nAnd, it appears that iTeleport also supports multiple displays (see their FAQs).\nI suggest that you check the connections to the extra display, and see if there are any settings for iTeleport.\nYou can also look at the Screen Sharing preferences by opening /System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app and going to Screen Sharing-> Preferences. However, it doesn't appear that that allows you to change which display(s) are used.\n\nA: The root cause of the problem was that Vine Server was running instead of VNC.  Removing Vine Server from the startup list made both monitors visible again on the clients.\n", "Q: Shortcuts for # and $ not working on Turkish keyboard layout My keyboard layout is \"Turkish QWERTY PC\" and the problem is that I cannot type the special symbols being typed by using ⌥+3 and ⌥+4 which are \"#\" and \"$\".\nI opened the key viewer and typed ⌥+3. It then says that I typed \"#\" but that's wrong.\nIs there any solution to fix this? \nI am using a Macbook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.8.\n\nA: A brief look around and it seems as though an third party application like Ukelele should help you map keys correctly for your keyboard.\n\nA: Try using right-side ⌥+4.\n\nA: The most common cause for a key or two not working is that they have been set as triggers for speech recognition or text to speech.  Double check system preferences/speech to make sure this is not the case with your machine.\n", "Q: Is there an application for Windows7 (in bootcamp) to adjust the level of brightness of screen of iMac? I want to darken the screen of my iMac because it is too bright for me. I use an application called shades, but it doesn't work in bootcamp.\nI found the software for Windows Vista called VistaShades (link). Is there a similar application for Windows7?\n\nA: You do not need any software to do this. The Boot Camp drivers from Apple supports changing the brightness of the screen (using the keyboard modifier keys).\nThe drivers are already included in your Mac OS X DVD for installing Boot Camp Utilities. Otherwise, you can download the installation files using Boot Camp Assistant at /Applications/Utilities.\nSee here for more details.\n\nA: Apple Bootcamp seems to have an inferiority complex. The solution that I have found to make Bootcamp brightness keys work properly is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bootcamp.exe, Properties, Compatibility, Change settings for all users, Run this program as administrator.\n\n*Remove startup item using msconfig for bootcamp (as startup items don't work with run as admin)\n\n*Then create a Task Schedule for Bootcamp run as admin.\n\nA: Even without Apple's BootCamp, you can still dim your screen brightness with the help of the Mac Brightness Control software utility. However, it's NOT free.\n\nA: If you have the Apple wireless keyboard, The F1 and F2 buttons dim and brighten the screen.\n", "Q: Is it possible to filter which applications can use my iPhone's Personal Hotspot? Is it possible to filter which applications (in Windows) can use my iPhone's Personal Hotspot?\n\nA: No, it is not possible. Even by jailbreaking would not enable this, or more exactly not in a practical way.\n\nA: Technically yes you can but it depends on what firewall you use.\nSince the connection to the Hotspot will be a distinct Network Connection (interface), if your firewall will allow you limit apps based on process name and interface, then this will in fact achieve your goal.\n", "Q: How can I make Mac OS X run a program before shutting down? I am trying to get Mac OS X to save all my VirtualBox VMs when it reboots. I already have a script that does this, but I need OS X to run this script automatically before a reboot.\nWhen Mac OS X reboots, does it run /sbin/reboot?\nOr how else could this be achieved?\n\nA: Launchd sends an early warning of shutdowns to all scripts/daemons that have a StopService() subroutine. This gives your process the most time to clean up.\nJust use launchd to start the script and have it run in the background until it's time to exit.\nAfter the services that got the early warning are closing down, All processes get a SIGTERM signal a few seconds before the SIGKILL nukes them. \nYou could make a script that sleeps and traps SIGTERM to run your command when that time comes. You will have to see if that allows enough time in practice for the commands to execute. This avoids a little bit of coding, but not much - it's generally better to just make a daemon out of a shell script.\n\nFrom a historical perspective - /sbin/reboot and runlevels never existed on Darwin / OS X and rc.shutdown is deprecated along with the rest of rc now that launchd is the boss. You might be able to use rc.shutdown on tiger or earlier (I don't have one of those images handy to check presently) Lion certainly has removed all vestiges of rc.d and init.d.\nYou might want to see if sleepwatcher would help in your case. I haven't used it in quite a while - but it certainly aims to solve your dilemma.\n\nA: Although Apple recommends to use \"launchd\", the easiest is to create a shell script using, for example, Terminal's pico:\npico /Users/Shared/logoutHook.sh\n\nThe file can contain something like:\n#!/bin/bash\nsay 'Hasta la vista baby!'\n\nThen give execution rights:\nsudo chmod +x /Users/Shared/logoutHook.sh\n\nFinally, hook the script to the logout procedure:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook /Users/Shared/logoutHook.sh\n\n\nIf you start another application, as I haven't tested this, I think it might be useful to warn myself and you that:\n\n*\n\n*We might need to kill the shutdown signal to execute what we want;\n\n\n*Then send a new one (beware not to kill the signal sent by our own\nscript)…\n\nIf you want to remove the hook:\nsudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook\n\n\nIf using \"launchd\", the idea would be to capture the SIGTERM signal. Have a look at: /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.shutdown_monitor.plist\n", "Q: What's a good SSH tunneling client for OS X? I've been using SSH Tunnel manager to easily set up and stop port tunneling over SSH to various servers at my company. That saved me the pain of opening up a new terminal window which will hang out there just for the sake of having a tunnel open.\nThis worked great (well , sort of) but SSH Tunnel Manager is a PowerPC application. With Lion, it is not supported any more.\nWhat is a good replacement?\n\nA: Why not just use an SSH Tunnel via OSX's built in Terminal?...\nLaunch an SSH tunnel\nTo initiate your SSH tunnel, simply open Mac OSX Terminal.app and connect to your remote server via SSH with the following flags:\nssh -D 8080 -C -N username@example.com\n\nThis will launch our SSH tunnel on port 8080 and route all traffic (securely) through the server at example.com.\nBrowse the Web \nNow, let’s start browsing the web using with your new SSH Tunnel (Chrome):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Google Chrome\n\n*Select ‘Chrome’ up the top left\n\n*Select ‘Preferences’\n\n*Select ‘Show advanced settings…’\n\n*Select ‘Change proxy settings…’\n\n*Select ‘SOCKS Proxy’\n\n*Enter ’127.0.0.1′\n\n*Enter port ’8080′\n\n*Save changes by selecting ‘OK’\n\n\nA: I found Coccinellida, it works on Lion but it's new and a bit buggy : /\n\nA: On the terminal:\n$ ssh -N -L SOURCE-PORT:127.0.0.1:DESTINATION-PORT USER@SERVER-IP\n\nIf you use ssh with a private key just type:\n$ ssh -N -L SOURCE-PORT:127.0.0.1:DESTINATION-PORT -i KEYFILE USER@SERVER-IP\n\ne.g.\n$ ssh -N -L 8888:127.0.0.1:80 -i Documents/default.pem root@123.123.123.123 \n\nAfter that, you can browse using the tunnel.\ne.g.\non the browser: \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8888\n\nA: I strongly recommend using sshuttle. It's very handy.\n\nA: You could also check out Meerkat.\n\nA: SSHTunnel is a free, cocoa-based UI for SSH tunnel management. Works on 10.5 and up. It hasn't been updated in a while but the code that's there is reasonably stable. It's worked well for me in the past.\n\n\nA: Try Secure Pipes: http://www.opoet.com It's free software and I'm looking to get more people using it.\n\nA: I am using iSSH in Lion, which is a front-end application to the command line application “ssh”. It provides a quick and easy way to start an SSH connection to a remote computer.\n\nA: SSH Tunnel Manager is still alive and supported.\nSorry about the delay though, it is not compatible with El Capitan.\nhttp://projects.tynsoe.org/stm/\n\nA: I have an open-source and secure solution with XBar.\nInstall XBar:\n\n*\n\n*https://xbarapp.com\nInstall this ssh-tunnelling plugin:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/matryer/xbar-plugins/blob/main/Network/ssh-tunnel.1s.sh\nYou do need to edit the configuration for one time, but it's not that complicated:\nConfigure your ssh-tunnel config in your ~/.ssh/config (I use something like below):\n Host *\n   AddKeysToAgent yes\n   UseKeychain yes\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n   IdentitiesOnly yes\n Host some_name\n   Hostname host_ip_or_url_etc\n   Port 22\n   User your_username\n   LocalForward 5999 127.0.0.1:5900\n\nDon't forget to auto-start the ssh-agent:\n$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n\nA: Core Tunnel baked by Codinn is a tunnel manager that intuitive and easy to use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Support local, remote and dynamic port forwarding\n\n*Compatible with OpenSSH\n\n*Integrated with macOS Keychain\n\n*Automatic reconnect\n\n*Advanced config editor\n\n*Status icon in menu bar\n\n*Custom tags\n\n*Importing and exporting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: SSH Tunnel Manager is now in the Mac App Store!  So, you can run it on Lion.\n\nA: iSSH can not remember my password.\nCoccinellida can save password. But it freezed my Mountain Lion sometimes ...\nShimo is good, but it IS commercial.\n\nA: TunnelerX is simple and easy to use, focused on SSH SOCKS proxy. It doesn't exactly cover the requirement to manage several servers, as you can only add one server, although, it's usually enough for people looking to use an external box as proxy. It works fine under Mountain Lion.\n\nA: SSH Proxy on Mac App Store. It's simple, and it has the option to switch between Use Proxy for All Sites and Direct Internet Connection while SSH Tunneling is still connected. That way I don't have to clear the socks proxy from the browser whenever I need direct internet access.\n", "Q: Wireless or Wired Apple keyboard for programming? Why one or the other?\nI don't use the numpad nor much of the functional keys (delete, insert, etc.).\nThe latency with the wireless worries.\nWhat are your experiences?\n\nA: I prefer the wired version primarily because it has a 10-key pad, the dedicated page up/down and home/end keys, and the arrow keys aren't so tiny.\n\nA: I use the Wireless Apple Keyboard and there isn't any noticeable lag when using it. Unless you program really really quickly, I don't see a problem with using the wireless keyboard.\nThe only problem with the keyboard is when it is far away from the Mac - the Bluetooth signal could weaken and slow down the process.\n\nA: I would also recommend the wireless keyboard (keeping any old USB one around only for maintenance boots/backup).\nMy dream setup is a Twelve South MagicWand connecting a Magic trackpad with the bluetooth keyboard. Gestures are so powerful in Xcode and for swiping windows around. Lion is just going to make that input method better. I expect it will be a one year period of weaning myself from my mouse. For now it's still always on my desk and ready, but I'm starting to use it less as I get more proficient on the trackpad.\nMore info on the MagicWand is here. As I commented below on another answer for wireless, I've never seen lag as the device disconnects with a nice animation on the mac screen if it's not a reliable and fast connection.\n\nA: I use the wired keyboard primarily because it has two easy access USB ports.\n\nA: I have never seen slowness on the Wireless of any sort, latency is not an issue. Period.\nOn the other hand, key feel is an issue. The key mechanisms are different between Wired and Wireless; its harder to press the keys on the Wireless and it has a mushy feel.\nI tried one because I never used the numeric keypad (and I am a programmer) and was fine with the re-located cursor keys. The feel was so poor that my typo rate soared. Even a few hours of trying it prompted me to return it.\nI do want to try the older Compact Wired version. If it uses the say keys as the current wired, I'll switch.\n", "Q: I backed up my iphone to move it to a new phone all my contacts, notes and calendars are gone. when the iphone backs up does it copy everything? is there a way to get my important stuff back?\nnote: I didn't check 'sync contacts, notes, calendars' because I was travelling and had to use a different computer to sync our stuff. I assumed 'backup' and 'restore' meant something in this topsy turvy apple worldy. was I wrong?\n\nA: The backup function backs up all application data, system settings and user preferences. Data such as contacts, notes and calendars are only synced on request unless you are using something like MobileMe which syncs this data in the background.\nIf you didn't sync your contact, note and calendar data whilst you were travelling then your only backup remains on your primary machine. Restore from there and your contact, note and calendar information will be synced back from whatever applications you have designated as managers of that data.\nFrom my own personal experience I have used and restored from MobileMe independently of iTunes successfully many times and continue to use that service for that reason should an iTunes or system backup ever fail for me. In future this functionality will be available for all via the iCloud service.\n\nA: If you have back up your data on iPhone, you can restore from the backup.\nTo restore information from a backup, use one of the following methods after connecting your iOS device to the computer with which you normally sync:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click (or Control-click) the device and choose Restore from Backup\n\n*If you have a new phone, you can connect to iTunes and it will prompt to restore from your backup\n\n\nSolution from Apple.com: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1766\n", "Q: best free desktop gadget to get exchange rates I am new to Mac OS X. Is there any good desktop app or dashboard widget which displays latest exchange rates like Windows 7 gadgets on right side.\n\nA: Calculator.app doesn't display the exchange rates, but it does allow you to convert between them.  You can do this by entering a number in the calculator, and then going to the Convert > Currency... menu and choosing the appropriate currencies.\nIf you're looking for a Dashboard widget to show exchange rates, I'd suggest this one:  http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/calculate_convert/currencyconverter_palplesoftware.html\n", "Q: Create PDF from tall images (Automator?) I have a number of images that are 8.5\" wide, but very long (around 40\" tall) and I want to create a standard multi-paged 8.5\" x 11\" PDF document from all of the images. The problem is that the PDF will resize the images to fit the height of the PDF page or each page will be one image, which looks horrible.\nIs there a way to do slice each image after multiples of 11\" and combine those slices into a single PDF? I looked at Automator, but I couldn't find what I needed. If it's an application or script and not Automator, that's fine, too.\nThanks!\n\nA: PosteRazor is free, open source, and appears to do what you need. It takes a large image and splits it into a multi-page PDF. \nAs Nathan comments, the interface is pretty rough around the edges. Tiler and SplitPrint are paid alternatives if you prefer a little more flexibility and an interface that's easier on the eyes.\n", "Q: Cleaning a MacBook Pro keyboard that's been covered in juice My lovely son spilled apple juice on my laptop keyboard.\nIt works, but it feels like it has grit under the keys and sticks a bit.\nHow do I clean it out?\nI remember old keyboards could be just banged hard against the desk... I presume thats a bad idea though...\nIt's a macbook pro 15 inch laptop\n\nA: You can actually remove the keys, clean them and then replace them again.\nFollow this link to see how it's done: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSpPlMdGvVI\nThe problem with liquid damage is that although the laptop may work fine now, if the juice has got onto the Logic Board, it can cause corrosion over time, which will more than likely cause issues.\nHowever, I do hope this is not the case! Good luck!\n\nA: Clean all the parts, especially the logicboard. Heat it up and apply flux! Or have a professional do it for you, shouldn’t cost too much. There’s also other cleaning solutions. Most important part, give it a few days to completely dry out afterwards.\n\nA: Before doing anything I would drop the computer in a big sack of rice to make sure it dries up internally. You don't want any of that juice seeping down the cracks to the motherboard believe me!\nGood luck!\nTOM\n", "Q: Linux 'Byobu' equivelant for mac So at home ive been a linux user for a while, and frequently use byobu in the terminal. After a little searching I was unable to find anything like it for a mac, which I now have to use at work. I'm curious as to there being any software available to macs that can do this, or has a similar setup.\n\nA: Sorry to necro an old post, but I am adding my own tricks and hacks that were needed to get this to work, since this is the first result for \"byobu on mac\".\nAfter performing brew install byobu, I encountered the same error that @jrwen encountered. I tried to install both coreutils and tmux, but it turned out that I had coreutils installed. However my $PATH was setup in such a way that /usr/local/bin came towards the end so the mac versions were always found first. I fixed this by adding \nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH \n\nto my ~/.bashrc and sourcing it.\nAfter this I still got an error saying \n/usr/local/bin/byobu: line 53: ../Cellar/byobu/blah blah : No such file or directory\n\nNot sure what brought this on, but the hack that I used to fix this was to add \ncd /usr/local/bin \n\nTo the top of my /usr/local/bin/byobu script\nIt now works!!!\n\nA: No need to look for an equivalent. It's available for the Mac. You can quickly and easily install it using the excellent Homebrew package manager. Once you have Homebrew installed, just type brew install byobu from the Terminal. It'll download the source, configure and install it.\n", "Q: Tagging Faces in Aperture 3 and syncing with Facebook tags When I tag someones face in Aperture, it lets me either choose a name from Facebook (with the FB icon), or from my Address Book. Sometimes, these names may differ. \nOne of my issues with uploading to Facebook from Aperture is that I will tag a face (that may not even be on Facebook), and it will still tag that face when it goes up. Can you disable not syncing non-facebook faces? \nAlso, what happens if I have a person in my address book and friend them on Facebook? Is there a way to tag them so it works on both? As in, my wife uses her full name on Facebook, but in my Address Book its just first and last. How do I tag her in Aperture so that it matches her Address Book entry, but also automatically does it on Facebook as well?\n\nA: If a face is already duplicated (i.e., there're two faces of the same person), you can pick up (from the faces cockboard page) the 2nd face and drop into the 1st. Aperture or iPhoto will merge these 2 faces into 1.\nIf a face isn't already duplicated and you're trying to prevent duplication, prior to 10.7 Lion, you set the email address of the entry in Address Book to that in Facebook. Apparently, this is the field that Aperture/iPhoto uses to match up Facebook & Address Book.\nFor 10.7 Lion, Address Book has introduced a field called Profile->Facebook. By all looks, this looks to be the new field for matching, but Lion is too new to have confirmation from Google of my suspicion.\n", "Q: What does 'automatically check for newly published albums'  in Aperture mean? I like using Aperture to upload to Facebook and Flickr, but I don't like how it syncs. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*What does this option actually do?  \n\n*I can't stand all the lists of my sets on the left hand side of the application. It clutters the UI, and I won't be managing it through there anyways. Can I hide/remove these?\n\n\nA: This searches your online Facebook and Flickr account for any images that have been uploaded since your last Aperture upload. If there are new images in your Facebook or Flikcr albums these will be catalogued into Aperture. \n", "Q: This iPhone is synced with another iTunes library........do you want to erase this iPhone How to copy songs from my PC to iphone without erasing my iphone?\nitunes giving this error\n\n\nA: You have to connect the iPhone to the machine you originally synced it with and check the manually manage music and videos option on the summary screen, in iTunes.\n\nAfter that you'll be able to connect your iPhone to any iTunes library and drag and drop media straight on to the device, in the column on the left of iTunes.\n\nYou can also try to back up your iPhone on the new machine, by right clicking on the device in the left pane of iTunes and selecting backup.\nNote: If you sync with the new machine, music will not transfer from your phone to the computer, and you will have the same problem if you try to perform a sync with the original machine!\n", "Q: A good iPhone app for it when standing in the dock I have an Apple dock for my iPhone 4 and find it beautiful so I like to have it in my desktop or my bed table while charging. The thing is I'd like to have a simple app that shows me the time, weather, maybe a small brief of my social network accounts, dunno just useful info so the phone isn't just standing there with the screen off.\nI find difficult to find something like this with a decent graphics quality in the iTunes Store. Any suggestions? \n\nA: I'm using Alarm Clock (there's a free version, but with an ad on the bottom, so not very \"beautiful\").\n\nIt shows the time of the day (obviously) and can also show the date, and the weather/temperature.\nNice touch: sliding your finger increase/decrease brightness.\n(But no social network)\n\nA: The easiest way to do this and get exactly the look you want is to create (or find) a web site that displays that.  Go to it on Safari, and make a web clipping out of it.\n", "Q: SSD instead of DVD temperature just installed Intel 320 instead of DVD in Macbook MC516LL.\nDoes old DVD place is equivalent to standard HDD place in Macbook from temperature (thermal) perspective? \n\nA: Since the SSD is likely to be powered on much more than the DVD ever was, your thermal load inside the mac will be higher. Most SSD use even more power at idle than HDD, but it won't be nearly as bad as the CPU/GPU running full tilt. The fans may run faster to compensate if the ambient temperature is high, but I've heard no hints of problems even from people in warm environments with SSD+HDD.\nThere are many apps to log the temperatures so you can get a before / after log and check on things as you should whenever you add parts not planned by the manufacturer.\n\nA: SSD Should be safe. I have the same scenario - my drive is a WD Caviar Black 500GB runing at 7200 rpm (WD500BEKT) and I have a Intel 320 120GB SSD on the optical drive. I have a 13\" MBP 2010, which has a little better motherboard layout, but the same chipset. Here is my point:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel 320 does not have a thermal sensor.\n\n*Intel 320 has 5 years of warranty.\n\n*The drive's operating temperature range is 0˚C to 70˚C (Intel 320 Specs)\n\n*The only wear out indicator is the E9 Smart attribute (media wear-out indicator), and it's not connected to the temperature at all.\n\n*You always have a backup, right?\n\n\nHaving all this in mind: There should be very hard to reach 70˚C inside the drive bay and EVEN if your device fails because of that, there is no way for Intel to prove this (there is not a temperature record in the SMART database).\n", "Q: Cookie for domain can't be saved I'm having an issue with a website. On one machine (10.6.8) it is not possible anymore to save the login cookie of a particular website. The site does not work with any user account on that Mac anymore. \nThis issue occurs in all browsers on that machine. On other machines or for other domains on the same machine the logins are working fine. The user's password is definitely correct as it works on other machines. The problem is that the cookie of that particular web page cannot be saved. \nI tried without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check Setting (Cookies are allowed)\n\n*Reset browsing data of all browsers\n\n*Delete ~/Library/Cookies/\n\n*Repair permissions\n\n*Reboot and reset PRAM.\n\n\nDoes anyone has ideas on this? Thanks.\n\nA: The problem  with the date on the computer is related to the cookie's expiration. The website is reporting that the cookie is valid from 1 week (or whatever) when it is created and given to the computer, but when the browser compares the cookie's expiration period to the current system time, it is either a TRUE or FALSE value. Because the date is so far off, it's always a FALSE (it only needs to be 1 second outside the valid period to get a FALSE value).\nThis is true for Windows too. Most people have this same problem with Windows 8.\n", "Q: Font properties of text layer in PSD file -- possible to inspect without Photoshop?

I want to monitor each application's network/internet usage on my Mac.\nSort of like how Activity Indicator shows total upload/download usage -- but I also want to know particular application usages.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: The app Little Snitch can do this. Among many other things, it shows traffic by app.\nIt costs $29, but there is a free trial available.\n\nA: Another app I've used is RubbertNet (site is down, linked via archive.org).  Also not free, but has a free trial available.\n\nA: A combination of\nHandsOff! and SurplusMeter\nis my current solution. HandsOff is an advanced firewall which similar to LittleSnitch. It's not free, but a trial version is available. Surplusmeter on the other hand is free and open source.\nAmong the features which you need for monitoring network usage are:\n\n*\n\n*monitoring network activity of every process (HandsOff!)\n\n*get the network usage of individual processes (HandsOff!)\n\n*log total network usage (SurplusMeter)\n\nHandOff does only display the network usage since boot. It does not log the data which is why I need SurplusMeter. However, SurplusMeter only logs the total network usage for all applications.\n \n\nA: Apple include a customised version of tcpdump as part of MacOS/OSX which allows for the display/filtering of packet capture metadata information - which contains a number of items (see man page excerpt below) and includes process information. e.g. so you could run it to capture traffic only from firefox (-Q proc=firefox) and print out all packet metadata information (-k):\nsudo tcpdump -Q proc=firefox -k\n\nOr you could run it with just the -k option(s) and extract and analyse data per process name/pid. For more details see man tcpdump - here's the relevant sections (though there's more in the man page about the PKTAP filters):\n  -k Control  the  display  of packet metadata via an optional metadata_arg argument.\n     This is useful when displaying packet saved in the pcap-ng file format  or  with\n     interfaces that support the PKTAP data link type.\n\n     By default, when the metadata_arg optional argument is not specified, any avail-\n     able packet metadata information is printed out.\n\n     The metadata_arg argument controls  the  display  of  specific  packet  metadata\n     information  using  a  flag  word, where each character corresponds to a type of\n     packet metadata as follows:\n\n                 I     interface name (or interface ID)\n                 N     process name\n                 P     process ID\n                 S     service class\n                 D     direction\n                 C     comment\n                 C     flags\n                 U     process UUID (not shown by default)\n                 A     display all types of metadata\n\n     This is an Apple modification.\n\n   -Q expression\n     To  specify a filter expression based on packet metadata information like inter-\n     face or process name.

How do I move the Library/WebServer/Documents folder, which contains files shown by http://localhost ? For instance, to the Desktop. Also, can the ~/Sites folder be moved too?\n\nA: So the short answer with reply is, \"Sure, but WHY?!?\"\nThe WebServer for Mac OS X (I'm assuming 10.6 Snow Leopard Client for the details of the answer) is based entirely on Apache. There are tonnes of web resources for Apache.\nThe key to Apple's Web Services are in /etc/apache2\nYou can (with admin privs) modify the httpd.conf (again; loads of web refs on this file) specifically pointing DocumentRoot anywhere.\nHowever; and this is the list of caveats of why this is a weird thing to do...\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to be sure that the web process has the proper privs to read the directory in the location you may move it.\n\n*You run the risk of something getting access to other files around the moved location\n\n*This is non-standard configuration in the OS and is likely to break in a future verison\n\n*The location is non-user volatile; meaning that deleting a user won't accidentally delete the served root folder. (Apache will fail to launch) if it can't find a served root folder\n\n\nOn top of this; we talk about moving the ~Sites. When you generate a new user acct; the OS generates a virtual directory conf in the /etc/apache2/users directory. Apache is smart enough to expand the ~ into a user name. All the above Caveats hold.\nThe question is why do you want the root folder on your desktop? It would seem to be more convenient to do one or more of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*make an alias of /Library/WebServer/Documents on your desktop\n\n*Setup groups/acls on /Library/WebServer/Documents to assure the correct write access\n\n\nWithout knowing why you're motivated to do this; I can't really hazard any other suggestions.\nIf it's a question of moving your web services directory to a network share... Now your solution is more along the lines of OS X Server (10.6) or doing your own apache install.\nGood luck.\nYou have to be sure that the web process has the proper privs to read the directory in the location you may move it.\n", "Q: Free software for mounting an FTP share as a writeable folder in Finder Transmit and Forklift are paid, we can't use finder, macfusion doesn't work... so I'm wondering...\nIs there any free option left to mount an FTP on finder so that I can write files to it? Maybe using scripts or automator? Maybe fixing my issue with macfusion? I don't even know why my installed macfuse is 2.1.7 (beta) while it asks me to \"update\" to 2.0.3 or, if I tick \"Show Beta Versions\", 2.1.5! In general, it looks to me the whole thing is too unstable yet.\nLast case, I'll just stick with CyberDuck. And yes, I've  just tried them all except automator.\n\nA: You could create a tiny Automator application to do the job.\nInside of Automator, add the following two actions to your workflow\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Get specified servers\"\nSpecify your server/servers in this action as follows: ftp://username:password@yourserver.com\n\n*\"Connect to servers\"\n\n\n(The names of the steps might not be a little off since I'm not running an English version of OS X)\nSave this as an application and start it whenever you need.

The FAQ for PhoneView has a windows software recommendation that does about the same things if you prefer that OS on the desktop.\n(edit: I don't know of any free alternatives that mount the file system) \n", "Q: What is Apple's serial number flagging procedure? My iPad was stolen a couple of weeks ago. I filed a police report, used Find My iPhone to locate the iPad, and was subsequently featured on the local news for a story...sadly, none of these routes did anything to recover my property. (Makes me think Find my iPhone is more of a cool novelty than a useful utility; the police couldn't get a warrant, because the app shows a spot on a map, doesn't give a specific address. But I digress...)  \nI remotely locked my iPad, but did not wipe it (I consider that route to be giving up), and called Apple. The representative said that they could flag my serial (contrary to what the internet believes), and that when someone tries to activate it, they will notify law enforcement.   \nNo one at Apple Support seems to know how this process works. The latest guy I spoke with said that it is a small department, and there's no way to directly contact any of them. (I pictured like 3 old-time detective looking guys in suspenders, smoking cigarettes and wearing beat up derby hats...but I have problems ::shrug::). \nDo any of YOU fine people have any insight into this process? I have an idea, but I'd just like to know if anyone has ever recovered a stolen device by this method.\n\nA: Regarding the flagged serial number, I had this done for a client but nothing ever came of it, so either it wasn't ever activated or there is no official procedure for our country. \nOn a side note regarding tracking down a physical address. If your iPad is set to check email accounts such as google or your own hosted mail. As soon as it's online it'll put the originating IP in the logs which is something the police might be able to get a warrant for. Google actually lists all current active connections and 'recent activity' from IP and how long ago. It's listed in the bottom right corner (details). This could be useful in tracking down an address. \n\nA: I've had two iPhones and a MacBook stolen. I gave the serial number of both iPhones to Apple and the police. The detectives told me the only way they ever get someone's stolen device back is if:\na. The thief is positively identified and still has the device.\nb. They come across it in a cache of stolen goods and are able to cross-reference the serial number.\nI told them I'd given Apple the serial number. They advised me to tell AT&T instead since they could look it up by IMEI. This was no help either. My guess is that Apple takes the serial number of stolen products as a symbolic gesture to pacify distraught customers.\nI lucked out since my first phone was purchased with a credit card. It was covered by Mastercard's purchase protection plan. The full cost of both phones was reimbursed. I would highly recommend looking into this if you purchased the iPad with a credit card.\nMy stolen MacBook was another story. I left it in a cab. After I realized my mistake I called the cab company and left my name and number in case it turned up. Several months later I received a mysterious phone call from someone claiming to be the next passenger in the cab. He told me he had taken the cab to the airport, and had mistakenly taken my laptop bag with him to Serbia. He helpfully offered to send it back if I would only pay return costs and the extra baggage fees he incurred bringing it on the plane with him...\n\nA: File a police report and/or have a lawyer contact Apple. If you are serious, get a professional to help as it sets you apart from someone crying wolf (I'm not saying you are) and lays the groundwork for proving you are who you say you are.\nYou'll need this and more to get your property back or hope to shame or enable someone to be punished if they were dealing in stolen property. In the US at least, it's far more likely the device will end up in a pawn shop than an Apple store so getting your details to law enforcement will increase the chance you can recover your iPad and also deter theft for profit by making it harder to sell stolen goods.\n\nA: Apple does not have a procedure to 'flag' serial numbers as stolen in order to withhold support/assist in the recovery of stolen property. Not only is it a logistically difficult endeavor, but it raises serious safety concerns for individual support personnel. Support representatives may take your information, but it's a purely symbolic gesture. There is nothing they can do. \nThe best contact for this sort of thing is your local police department. Stolen property is recovered regularly, and many precincts will maintain a registry of this sort of data in order to reunite victims with their stolen property. \n", "Q: Spotlight menu shows results, but Finder window doesn't When I type anything into the Spotlight menu in the top right corner, I get the normal list of top results. But if I then click \"Show All\", or if I just go to the Finder and initiate a search there, it returns no results. The status bar says \"Searching This Mac…\" and I get the spinner in the corner, but it never goes away and never shows any results.\nI have had Spotlight reindex my entire hard drive twice, and it doesn't help. Rebooting doesn't help either.\nHelp?\n\nA: It turns out that the problem was that I had the Finder window list set to sort by the Kind column. Spotlight apparently does not like that arrangement, and refuses to display results. I had to sort by Name, close the window, and reopen it. Now Spotlight works perfectly.\nThis problem was originally with Snow Leopard, and persisted on Lion 10.7.0, but seems to have been fixed at some point before Mountain Lion 10.8.4.\n", "Q: The iOS Reverse Sync: Urban Legend or Real? My MacBook was stolen a couple of weeks ago...along with my iPad, ThinkPad, wallet, and all I hold dear (besides my wife, thankfully). Also stolen was my 2TB backup hard drive...yeah they got ya boy good huh?  \nAnyway, I got a new MacBook, and on my iPhone is all (most of) my media. Not all of it was purchased in iTunes, so I can't download it from the store. I can SSH into the phone, or use iPhone Explorer to steal my files back....from myself. \nHere are my issues:\nMusic - easy. Copy from device, then import to iTunes. The funky file names don't mean anything since the iGods speak ID3.\nAlso, when I DID hit \"Transfer Purchases\" in iTunes, it put all my purchases on my MacBook, but now they won't show up on my iPhone. They're still there though. I can tell because the space is being used (feels kinda like \"I know you're there; I can hear you breathing, fool...\")   \nPics - They're all in weird folders (F00, F01...Fxx). Importing to iPhoto doesn't organize them as nicely as iTunes does music. Does anyone know of a script that will put them all in one root folder? Then I could go from there. I'd rather not navigate through hundreds of folders, or have hundreds of unorganized iPhoto events.  \nContacts - This is probably the easiest one, I admittedly just haven't researched how to reverse sync contacts. Seems possible, since they sync contacts in the Apple Store without attaching their computer to your newly-purchased iDevice. ::Alt+Tabs to iTunes:: Yeah, I actually just figured this one out. Checked \"Sync Address Book Contacts\" duh, Thomas. I've actually never seen the \"Merge Info\" option before. Maybe because I've never had my syncing computer stolen before.  \nAnyway, thanks for partaking in my ramblings. Any suggestions for my actual issues would be greatly appreciated.  \nThanks!\nThomas\n\nA: I am so sorry seeing your two questions about stolen data and property. Ugh.\nI would recommend PhoneView to get the songs back (as well as all sorts of other structured data) - the free download works for a limited number of songs, contacts, etc... You pay to unlock the entire iPhone's worth of data once you are sure it's what you want for the job.\nI have had good luck getting pictures, contacts and songs off an iPhone that iTunes insisted was corrupt and needed a restore. The OS on the phone needed a restore, but my data was luckily still fine and salvageable.\nLastly, you didn't ask, but I also really like CrashPlan which also has a free trial period for off-site backup of your data.\n\nA: What I use to copy music off iPods is DeTune – freeware. Works really well!\nFor the photos... copy all the Fxx folders to a folder on your hard drive, and spotlight for \"all photos in this directory\".Spotlight searches recursively, so it will list all your photos. Then, you can drag them to yet another new folder (so they're all in one folder, obviously), and import them to iPhoto from there. After that, you can delete the two temporary folders.\nWon't restore your events, though.\n\nA: You may not have a machine with this OS, but Windows Photo Import Wizard on Windows XP may be able to get your photos back.\n", "Q: Which programing languages can be used for publishing to the Mac App Store? What are the programing language requirements for publishing to the mac app store? Obviously Obj-C is the main one, but can someone publish using something like C++? Or Java?\n\nA: The rules for the Mac App store are converging towards that of the iOS App store.  The iOS App store currently allows the use of almost any programming language (even Basic or Assembly), as long as everything required for that language (code, interpreter, runtime, libraries, etc.) is bundled with the app.  For instance, many iPhone games have a built-in Lua interpreter or a C# runtime.\nIf a language used by an app requires any separately installed support other than that built into the Lion Mac OS distribution, the review guidelines say that app will be rejected.  Cocoa and webkit (for Javascript) are currently built into the Mac OS X distribution.\nSo, if you want to use Java, you might be able to get away with including your own complete JVM and all needed runtime support libraries for Java in the app bundle.\nBTW, XCode supports using C++ and Objective C++ code, as well as Objective C and its plain C subset.  But you may have to use some Objective C APIs to make an application compliant with all the UI guidelines, even in a mostly C++ app.\n\nA: This article from 2010 reveals some of the more explicit guidelines Apple publishes for what apps can't do or be made of if you want to sell them in the App Store. Of particular note that article says:\n\nNo Java?: Apps that use deprecated or optionally installed technologies (e.g. Java, Rosetta) will be rejected.\n\nThat is actually an interpretation of the App Store Review Guidelines that say: \"apps that use deprecated or optionally installed technologies will be rejected.\" (reference for that quote that doesn't require an Apple Developer account). Which means most, if not all, Java is outlawed or on its way to being outlawed because the custom Java Apple produces is now deprecated on OS X. Going forward Java on OS X won't ship with the OS, it'll be a user-installed product that they download from...maybe Oracle I guess. We'll have to see.\nNo other languages are specifically listed as forbidden but with any other language other than Objective-C getting the UI requirements right would be really quite difficult. Apple is very concerned with quality and the look and feel of applications. So languages that produce non-standard UIs (i.e. don't follow the Apple UI Guidelines) are going to be more likely candidates for rejection.\n\nA: According to this page: Examples of apps in the Mac App Store not made with objective-c/c/c++ ?\nBriquette is made with ruby.\n", "Q: How do I revert my iPod touch 8 GB (2nd Generation) to ios 3.2?

(iClarified doesn't have 3.2)\n\n*Does Apple support downgrading for OS compatibility testing?\n\n\nThanks\n\nA: As bckbck already said, you need the SHSH blob from the earlier version. If you don't have it for the desired OS version, it's too late.\nAnd iOS 3.2 was only supported on the iPad, so it won't run on iPod touches.\nShould the data on http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=SHSH be correct, then you can downgrade to iOS 4.1 with your device.\nAnd you can get all firmwares at http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/.\n\nA: First, iPhonos (my way of saying “iPhone OS”) 3.2 was a unique version that was only available for iPad users. Since iOS 4, the iPad versions have the same version as the iPhone and touch version. \nSecond, on iPhone 3GS and touch 3g and later, plus all iPads, it uses a unique number, called a SHSH, which is a code made up of other codes in your device, including your device's firmware version and serial numbers of the hardware inside the device. But, the touch 1g and 2g, as well as the original iPhone and the iPhone 3G, do not have some of the hardware required for the SHSH to be generated, so they have to fill in some of the gaps in the SHSH that the missing hardware would have filled in. This needs to be done by the software, not hardware. iDevices that run iPhonos 3 or earlier don't know of this, so you can downgrade to any earlier iPhonos version without needing to save a SHSH. \nYou should use the firmware page that @jan.h mentioned, but make sure you use the second dropdown list, as the other dropdown is for iPods that don't run iOS. \nAd@m\n", "Q: Can .plist files be restored to the Preferences directory? Recently I have been having some issues with hooking an external monitor up to my Macbook (worked at first, now will detect but wont display anything). I found that the solution may be to delete com.apple.windowserver.plist in the Preferences directory and let OS X restore it for me on reboot. However, when looking through that directory I have found that the file doesn't even exist there anymore! Is there any way I can run a repair on my filesystem to restore that file or will I have to re-install OS X (FYI I'm running latest Snow Leopard)? \n\nA: Files in the Preferences directory can be safely deleted.\nApps automatically create these files if they don't exist already and fill them with default values.\nThis is how apps can be installed simply by dragging the .app into the applications folder.\nNext time that file is required, it will be created and populated with default values.\nI just tested on my system: I deleted /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist. I logged out and back in, and that didn't restore the file. But, I tried rearranging my monitors in System Preferences-> Displays-> Arrangement, and the file was neatly recreated.\nSo, short answer: That file will be automatically recreated as soon as it's required. Don't sweat it.\nThe same applies to just about every, if not every, .plist preferences file.\n", "Q: Hard drive unmounted and missing then back? I have a 15\" 2011 MBP with the OWC data doubler (a generic version).  In my primary drive position (the spot where the factory HDD was) I have an OCZ-VERTEX 3.  In the data doubler (the spot where the factory DVD drive was) I have the factory HDD (500 GB Hitachi).\nThe other day, I opened my MBP resuming from sleep and the OS told me a drive had been unmounted unexpectedly (or something like that).  The first thing I did was open finder and I saw that the factory drive's mount was missing.  I checked in the System Profiler under Serial-ATA and the drive didn't show up.\nI rebooted a couple times and it the mount point never came back.  I was traveling at the time, so I guessed the SATA connector came off and that I'd have to open the case when I got home.  I got home, booted up and the drive was back, the mount point was there and so was all of my data.\nAs far as I can tell, the Mac doesn't know there was ever a problem.  I've done a little poking around in the logs and I can't find anything indicating what happened.  The drive's smart status says verified...\nThese are the only possibly relevant log entries I've found:\n7/5/11 1:07:27 AM   fseventsd[49]   event logs in /Volumes/Storage/.fseventsd out of sync with volume.  destroying old logs.

If something bad happens, replace the SSD and back it back up. \nOther than that, there really isn't much you can do.

I am deploying a new version of an application on to multiple machines (100+) and when I test it on a machine, the \"You do not have permission to use the application\" box pops up, due to quite strict restrictions on the machine. If I click \"Always Allow...\" then everything works fine. However I do not wish to have to click this box on 100+ machines. Is there a command line alternative which can accomplish the same thing?\n\nA: If you can't work out what \"Always Allow\" does, I would suggest running something like fseventer to see what OS X changes. If it hits a plist file then you'll be able to run defaults on it. \nI'm assuming its probably in the com.apple.applicationaccess.plsit.

I was sad to see that they all look like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some Person discusses ...\n\n*Fulano Tal shows how ...\n\n*How to fully setup a ...\n\n\nHow can I get a list that will wrap and show more than 3-4 words. \n\nA: I suggest searching for podcasts on the iTunes web interface from within mobile Safari. Both Bing and Google accept a site parameter that will allow you to filter for a specific site. In thie case, you could search for a podcast and add the site:itunes.apple.com parameter at the end. Like this: \n\nthis week in tech site:itunes.apple.com\n\nThe search results in Safari should be easier to read. Each link should open in the iTunes app in your iPhone. Hope this helps. \n\nA: As far as I know this is not possible. The iPhone screen is just to small. I am using the Mac to search for podcasts.\nMaybe some of the third party apps could help.\n", "Q: How do I edit Managed Client preferences without them getting replaced? Specifically I would like to edit com.apple.applicationaccess.new.plist. (Which is in /Library/Managed Preferences/[username]/), but when I restart the computer my edited preferences are replaced with the old version.\nHow do I go about editing them for good? I only have command line access via SSH.\n\nA: Turns out that the master copy of com.apple.applicationaccess is kept in /private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/[user].plist. Editing that solved the problem for me. Thanks to Lyken for helping me find this on this question.\n\nA: Managed preferences are set up by the administrator of the Open Directory / Active Directory, so short of unbinding your mac from all of these servers, you will have to live with the changes imposed on that mac or keep changing them when you log in.\nDo you really need to stay connected to the servers if they are making changes you can't get them to reverse?\nLaunchd would be a good tool for you to add a script that makes those changes for you when you log in, but that's just automating a workaround and not resolving the issue. Similarly, launchd can be used to implement Managed Preferences on boot as described in this short video seminar. You might have to check into launchd on the mac to see if someone implemented a similar restriction using Workgroup Manager.\n", "Q: How I could redirect all my traffic to Tor network? I need to redirect all my traffic to Tor network. I have just installed Vidalia, but I think that I have not correctly configured my Tor-client. I have a Java desktop client that have to access to a website. This allows us to connect 50 times then it reject our connection. I would like to use Tor to  create more conecctions. How I can configure my tor-client correctly? Is there any online how-to? Are there other solutions?\n\nA: You can't redirect ALL traffic into TOR - if you mean all traffic at the IP level. (so all icmp, tcp and udp traffic), because you need basic routing via the internet - e.g. you need route TOR packets to neigbohrs. TOR is an VIRTUAL network using onion routing (SOCKS), so you need explicitly route packets into TOR.\nIf you mean \"route ALL web-browsing traffic\" into tor-network, the easiest way is using Firefox and get a torbutton plugin into firefox.\nAfter installing the plugin, it is enough:\n\n\n*\n\n*start Vidalia, and\n\n*activate \"torbutton\" in the Firefox. (bottom right corner).\n\n\nBTW, it is a good practice:\n  - use Safari (or Chrome) for you common browsing, and\n  - use Firefox for anonymous things (you can setup Firefox start into \"private browsing\" mode, you should disable cookies and so on...\nBEWARE - if your browser gets a cookie via TOR and after it send this cookie via normal browsing session - you get the idea :)\n", "Q: Time machine wants to backup too much Time Machine stopped this morning, stating it has too little disk space left. It wants to back up 200 gigs, but my local hard drive has 240 gig used and 150 gig are excluded in the Time Machine options, so this leaves 90 gigs of data at most that can be backed up, and I am pretty sure only very few files have changed (no big update or similar). So I would estimate a backup of, at most, 1 gig.\nHow can this happen? Any idea?\n\nA: The system over estimates the amount of space needed when large changes are detected (say if an entire folder changed in a way that it can't easily tell the files inside are the same). Also, minor file system corruption can wreak havoc on the algorithms. Have you rebooted the mac in safe mode to force a fsck file system check to rule out that error?\nThat will usually force a full filesystem traversal and may let the system go back to not over-estimating the space needed by such a large amount.\nWith Lion - you have the excellent tmutil command. You could turn off automatic backups and use the tmutil compare command to see what has changed since the last backup. It's a very powerful tool and you can get a much better feel for what has changed - either between specific instances in time or overall.\nFurthermore, to get out of the situation, you can often \"nurse\" the backupd process along by adding most of the large folders on the drive to the Time Machine exclusion list. Most of the time, adding /Users and /Library is enough. You can also let Time Machine skip backing up the system and try that to get a partial backup. By not changing files and letting it process parts of the drive and not assuming that it needs to do the entire drive in one hit lets you relax the exclusions list progressively until the whole drive is again backing up without complaint.\n\nA: Sometimes Time Machine improperly estimates the space required, and says it runs out of space.  Then it works OK on the next scheduled backup.  What happened on the next backup an hour later?\n", "Q: Joins both usb and wifi personal hotspot iphone My macbook automatically joins both the usb and the wifi version of my iPhone's personal hotspot. I know I can just turn airport off or only enable my iPhone's usb tether.\nIs it possible to make my mac only join the usb mode and not the wifi, if both modes are enabled?\n\nA: There is no built-in logic to specify an if/then decision to not join WiFi so the mac will join any WiFi SSSID that is detected and matches its list of auto-join networks.\nYou can set the service order by \"secondary clicking\" the gear at the bottom of the Network Preference Panes to Set Service Order... and make sure the WiFi is lower than the USB connection. It will still join, but no traffic will flow while the USB connection is viable.\nLastly, you could just make a new Network location called USB Only and turn off WiFi all together when you select that location on the mac. Changing network locations can be scripted as a service and AppleScript/Automater or FastScripts to effect or reverse the change you desire from a keyboard shortcut.\n", "Q: How do I take an iPad screenshot that includes a picture of the iPad border around it? I know how to take a normal screenshot with my iPad, but I'm looking to see how people on the internet are able to show content on the iPad in a picture that has the physical border of an iPad.\nDo they just take a screenshot and superimpose the image?\n\nA: Thanks, for mentioning my app, AutoScreenshot 3D!\nI created it for myself, as well as other developers, who want to superimpose their screenshot onto an actual image of an iOS device, and have it displayed at an angle, with mirror effect.  Makes a nice screenshot for iTunes or web or print!\nThe PRO version, for $0.99, lets you provide your own background image.  By default, it ships with an iPhone 4.  You can also download images that you can use for free, from http://www.AutoScreenshot.com.  We will add iPad images in the future, but you can google for an acceptable one.\nA free version is awaiting Apple's approval and it only uses the default background.\n\nA: A lot of the times those screenshots are taken on a computer from the iPhone or iPad simulator on the developer's Mac. It's included in the SDK if you have that it's free to download just not the development version of the iOS 5 SDK. Other than that take one of those images or an image of an iPad off the internet and then photoshop your screenshot into it and it should look pretty good.\n\nA: There is also a free browser app for adding a frame around the screenshot: FrameApp. \nIt works like this: you upload your screenshot, select the desired frame (iPad, iPhone, Kindle Fire, Google Galaxy - horizontal or vertical) and size, and then save your png. The best part is that the png has rounded corners, so that you can use it with any background. The tool is HTML5-based, so it works only in the browsers which support this (Firefox, Chrome & Opera).\n\nA: Take a look at this collection to use your screenshot in. I think this is what you may be looking for. They also make one for the iPhone. \nhttp://www.teehanlax.com/downloads/ipad-gui-psd/\n\nA: There's an app for that...\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autoscreenshot-3d/id430515377?mt=8\nUnfortunately, I can't see if it provides an ipad as well as the iphone border.\n\nA: Using AirServer on your Mac , It's possible to screenshot the iPad with your requirement.\n\nA: *\n\n*Use Reflector to Airplay the iOS device onto your computer screen\n\n*Press shift-command-4 to enter \"screen grab mode\"\n\n*Hover over the mirrored device and press the space bar (this select only that window)\n\n*Click mouse for screen grab (to desktop)\nThe screen grab will be the mirrored iOS screen AND any device screen you've chosen.\n\nA: Unless there is a specific app to (1) take a regular screenshot, then (2) superimpose the image to give it a border, this isn't possible out of the box.\nI've had the iPad for a while now, and was wondering the same thing. But alas, GIMP makes borders for me.\n\nA: Apple developers (which is where most of these screenshots come from) are given access to various marketing gumpf from Apple including device  images (with empty screens) that they can just overlay their screenshots in, as well as things like \"App Store\" logos, etc.\nI can't remember the exact wording (nor can I be bothered to re-read it right now) but I think it's against the Developer agreement to give those images out as they are. They're for marketing and that's their only licensed purpose.\nIf you want them (legally), pay Steve $99/year and he'll furnish you with the goods.\n\nA: I use Box shot king which allows you to easily do the iPad and many other items - it even allows you to create book covers. Incredibly simple to use but comes at a price ($99 a year).\n\nA: Using Reflector you can broadcast the iPhone and iPad screens to a Mac. Reflector superimposes a black (or white) border on the screen image.\nThe coolest part about Reflector is that with a screen video capture app, like SnapzProX, you can record the iPad in action.\nWe plan to use Reflector for our iPads at school on our Mac & PC desktop classroom machines.\n\nA: There is a free app, DS Screenshot, that will add your screenshots to all device images at the same time. It does both iPhone and iPad. \n", "Q: Add a hosts file entry without jailbreaking I have an iPad that needs to be able to connect to a server via its short hostname, e.g. http://app instead of http://app.example.com. The network it connects to assigns it a domain name other than example.com so it doesn't work automatically.\nIs there a way to add a hosts entry (/etc/hosts) for that server in iOS, or add the appropriate domain name to the resolver search list without jailbreaking?\n\nA: No.\nSee this answer on stackoverflow.\n\nA: No, but as a work-around, you could have your iPad proxy to a Mac on your home LAN and then do the DNS trickery there.\n(I'm assuming that you need this ability during debugging/testing, not \"everywhere.\")\n\nA: In general, editing the Hosts file is a bad solution. I only use it for temporary testing, and always remove any hosts file entry a few minutes after adding it.\nYou should be using a DNS server of some kind to setup your custom domain, perhaps this is possible with your wifi router, or else you can set up any mac as a DNS server.\nAs a nice side benefit, having your DNS server on the LAN will make your internet noticeably faster. Most people are using their router as a DNS server and they really are not fast enough to implement DNS properly. It's a good idea to use a fast remote DNS server (which one is best will depend on what city you live in), but having one on your LAN is even better.\nYou can google for instructions how to setup bind on any mac, it's free. Or you can purchase Lion Server from Apple in the App Store, and download Server Admin Tools to configure bind with a nice GUI (with Lion, unlike Snow Leopard, you have to download Server Admin Tools separately form buying a license for Mac OS X Server. Basically they've separated the advanced server tools out into a separate download from the basic ones).\n\nA: Use Weblock - AdBlock for iOS app to create a redirect rule from http://app to the IP and port you like.\n(Only works when on a WIFI network)\n\nA: It's been two years after the last comment & I've no idea if the OP will even read this or still needs a solution; however, for anyone who may have been led here via a search engine, the answer is yes, though not directly. Let me attempt an explanation. Editing the actual /etc/hosts file of a non-jailbroken iOS or iPadOS device isn't possible. However, as was alluded to in previous comments, you can use a local VPN. By local, I mean a device-only VPN as there is no need for a LAN server - excepting the security, privacy, speed, & fun that running a local DNS server would give you. Since the VPN opens up the \"space\" to use not only custom hosts files, but also allows you to connect to any, including private, DNSCrypt v1 or v2 servers, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) servers, or DNS over TLS (DoT)(1) servers with or without a custom hosts file, whether the hosts file is used as an extra layer of device security & privacy, for blocking the seemingly greater & greater number of ads on iDevices, or for the OP's desired purpose(2). Apple had been vague regarding the rules regarding App Store acceptance & in fact has rejected Apps due to a \"lack of entertainment value\", even if the rejected App is of practical use. Now, in order to detail the methods used to use a custom hosts file on a non-jailbroken iPad, I have to refer to specific Applications; I am not connected to any of the three Apps nor their developers beyond being a Beta Tester for one of them & a former Beta Tester for two of them, both of which no longer conduct beta testing. I'll use the list below to detail the relevant information: cost; DNS; stability; customization.\n\n\n*\n\n*DNSCloak: Free; DNSCrypt v1&2, DoH; stable, very customizable including being able to (2)forward IP addresses via DNS & do CNAME flattening.\n\n*AdGuard Pro $4.99USD; stable, DNSCrypt v1; customizable.\n\n*AdGuard Basic functions are free, everything else costs. Currently beta tested, which gives you everything at no cost beyond some of your time on GitHub. This is the only App that enables the use of (1)DoT. Both built-in and custom servers may be used; semi-stable; customizable.\n\n\nNote: each of the three apps show all incoming and outgoing DNS requests, which is helpful to, e.g. block specific traffic from ever leaving or reaching your device.\n\nA: Actually, there is a way.\nCreate your own app including a network extension that filters DNS queries using NEPacketTunnelProvider and parsing IP packets manually.\nI already have it, working perfectly, and will upload it in a few days. I will add the possibility to upload host files too.\nAlthough 7 years ago this was not technically possible.\n\nA: I had the same issue, a solution that works for me:\nAdd a \"search domain\" in the (manual) DNS settings in IOS for the wifi connection you are on. Entering \"example.com\" or \".example.com\" as search domain should result in the short name \"app\" being picked up and the search domain would automatically be appended so that \"app.example.com\" is connected to.\nIn case of a full domain name (for example a local test domain) which is not in the public DNS, and which needs to resolve to a (local) IP, it's an option to add such a domain to your home / office router's \"LAN DNS\" settings, so that the router catches and answers such DNS request instead of the public DNS server(s). A good solution in many scenarios although I assume it won't work for a short name like \"app\".\n", "Q: iPod Shuffle supporting software I have an iPod Shuffle. Unfortunately, I formatted it using Windows Explorer and copied some songs to it, but it's not working now. What happened to it? Did the supporting programs get formatted? How can I recover it?\n\nA: When you formatted it, you may have deleted its internal software. Never format iPods from Windows Explorer, Disk Utility, or anything that's not iTunes.\nTo fix this, launch iTunes, plug in the iPod, and restore its software from there. As this will format the disk, you should back up anything you have put on the iPod in the meantime.\nAlso remember that you have to use iTunes to put music on the iPod - you can't just drag files onto it.\n", "Q: Opt / Private Folder visible on HD? for some reason my /opt /private folders are not hidden anymore while the rest of my finder's hidden files are.  What would cause these to be visible again, and how do I change them back?

For some reasons, the connection seems to break in between (and more when idle).\nThe same connection works fine on my desktop.\nIs there any setting i need to make on the iPad ?\n\nA: Perhaps there is something wrong with the wireless portion of the router. Do other wireless internet devices have the same problem? (By desktop I am assuming that it is a wired Ethernet connection)\nRegardless, there is nothing that you can do on your iPad to fix the problem. \n", "Q: Mac Terminal: emacs-style command editing messed up This has been a \"quality of life\" issue for me for a while now- command-line editing in the Mac terminal is messed up for me.\nIf I type a few chars, and then hit CTRL-A to move to the beginning of the line, it'll move the cursor too far over. It seems like what's on the screen is out of sync with what bash really has in its \"buffer\".\nFor example, I start typing \"ls -l\":\n\n... and then hit CTRL-A to move the cursor, and I end up with the following on the screen:\n\nI think the following snippets from my .bashrc are relevant to a potential diagnosis: \nexport PS1=\"\\[\\h:\\w\\]\\$ \" \nexport SUDO_PS1=\"\\[\\h:\\w\\]\\\\$ \"\nset -o emacs\n\nFWIW, this also happens to me while using iTerm2 instead of the Mac default terminal.\n\nA: Drop the '\\[' and '\\]'. They mean \"the enclosed stuff doesn't take up display space\", and are messing up the count, as you suspected. They are usually used to enclose strings that set the following text color, f/ex.  Without them, the prompt - and emacs editing - will work correctly.\nHere's a handy prompt-syntax reference card.\n", "Q: How can I drag and drop transfer a playlist of songs using home sharing? It's easy to browse a list of songs using home sharing and import all the songs that are \"not in my library\". \nOnce that is done, is there an easy way to get the same playlist on the new library? \nThere is no option to import a playlist. You can drag a playlist from another computer to one of yours. But that would end up copying all songs again and creating duplicates.\n\nI ended up using Screen Sharing to export that playlist as File -> Library -> Export Playlist..., choosing XML format, then saving it to the desktop of the current mac. From there, it imported the playlist fine, but I was hoping I was missing a simpler, more drag and drop solution.\nI can't believe I'm actually looking for another feature to be added to iTunes - it's got to be there somewhere. \nAlso, I don't want all the playlists - just a few so exporting the whole library won't speed things up or simplify the operation.\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a new playlist on your local machine with the same name as the one you would like to import.\n\n*Click on the library that you wish to import a playlist from over Home Sharing.\n\n*Expand the library by clicking on the arrow to the left of the name.\n\n*Expand the folder called Playlists from within the library.\n\n*Drag the playlist from the home sharing library onto the one you have created.  \nYour music will be copied over into the new playlist.  This method does have one flaw, however.  If you already have some of these songs in your library, they will be duplicated.  But, File > Display Duplicates may help you with that.\nUnfortunately, this is the only way to do this over Home Sharing.  Hopefully, iTunes 11 will improve on this, but I'm not getting my hopes up.\n\nA: On the macbook i wanted the playlists imported to had file sharing set up as opposed to Home Sharng. \nIn iTunes i went to >file>library>import playlists then on the other mac i went to the >music>itunes> iTunes music library.xml file and imported it.\nThis imported all the playlists in 1 go, which is what i needed to do.\n", "Q: Does iTunes consider a one-star rating worse than no rating at all? If I want to tell iTunes I don't really like a track very much (but don't want to uncheck the track or delete it from my library) should I rate it as one star or leave it with no stars? Which would iTunes consider to be the lesser rating for a track?\n\nA: No stars is a lesser rating than one star.  This can be verified by sorting a playlist by rating, and having at least one song on it with one star, and at least one with no stars.  The one with one star will float above the one(s) with none.\n\nA: One star is certainly rated higher than none, but in practice, marking one star for the songs you really don't want to shuffle is a great practice.\nI have several \"utility\" playlists to weed out songs and having one star is one of the exclusionary criteria for the source of iTunes DJ\n\nmy zPartyTracks smart playlist criteria are all of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Album Rating - is not - one star\n\n*Rating - is not - one star\n\n*Genre - is not -  holiday\n\n*Time -  is less than -  12 minutes\n\n\nAs I've got many songs rated above 1 star, those never seem to show up in playlists that prefer higher rated songs, and the one star songs are relegated to being specifically included even though they did get one star.\n", "Q: In OS X 10.6 how do you mount an AFP share at boot or before user login? Is there a way to mount an AFP share at boot so it is accessible to the system without a user logged in?\nI would like to run scripts via SSH or as a daemon on boot that check files on my AFP share. Unfortunately, the shares don't mount until a user logs in.\n\nA: Not sure that you can.  I would think for security reasons a user has to be logged in, so that a set of credentials can be used.  There's probably some scripts that are run pre-login though, so I suppose if you specify your credentials in there it would be fine.\n\nA: Indeed you can script it all from terminal.\nYou will want to learn a little about launchd - that will specify when the mount will happen. At $5 the Lingon app from the App Store is great if you don't want to learn launchd configuration files.\nNext, you'll need a command to make the AFP mount.\nLast, you might learn security command to store or retrieve a password from the keychain if you don't want to store your afp password in the script.\nEach of these should be easy to learn more with a few internet searches.\n\nA: I would look into AutoFS. You can have AFP mounted on demand (see page 14 of the linked PDF).\n\nA: Here you go.  A bit outdated, but you can see how to do what you want from here. \nhttp://www.real-world-systems.com/docs/launchctl.1.html \n\nA: I recently had to support a client who needed to make sure an AFP network volume was always mounted so FileMakerPro server v5.5 could backup to that network drive. As you might imagine backups are really important for a 16 year old G5 XServe that is a mission-critical system, and yet still doesn't have the budget for new software & 40 new Macs all at once. So they are stuck at Mac OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard, and the server has been surprisingly OK running Mac OSX Leopard for about 20 years.\nIn this case, just mounting a drive at startup is not enough. Any network burp, even just power cycling a network switch could break that AFP connection.\nNo one ever looks in on this server, so it needs to try to take care of itself. (Alternately CronoSync Agent & ChronoSync can copy those files elsewhere, that was working well too).\nMy solution for OSX Tiger 10.4.11 was to use AUTOMATOR to make a 2 line app to mount the network drive (uses saved login from OSX Keychain) and run it daily via Cronnix, which is a GUI for Crontab. I expect this would also work in Mac OSX Leopard, Snow Leopard and maybe others.\nThe Automator workflow is;\n\n*\n\n*Get Specified Finder Items\n\n*\n\n*give it an alias of the network drive to mount.\n\n\n\n*Open Finder Items\n\nSave this both as a workflow and Save As again as an app. You can easily edit the workflow, and the App is slightly easier to run automatically. In this example below, the 2 line app is kept in the ~/Documents folder .\nThe Crontab command to run this is;\n/usr/bin/open \"/Users/<username>/Documents/<app_name.app>\"\n\nSee attached screenshots. Hope this helps. :-)\nI also blogged it here:\nhttps://www.nathanson.org/davesays/2021/how-to-mount-afp-network-drive-in-mac-osx-tiger-snow-leopard/\n\n\n\nA: Yes, this can be done, and it's actually necessary when you want the share point available to something like servers which are started and run without a user logged in.\nI did this years ago for something, and just again needed to do it, but my notes were inadequate. After a lot of fiddling, I've written enough details out so that I'll never have to do that again (I hope).\nYou combine launchd and a script, but there's some details that many other posts fail to mention. I captured them (at least for my setup).\nAll the nitty gritty details are here:\nhttp://www.gregwillits.ws/articles/using_launchd_to_mount_afp_share_point_upon_startup\n", "Q: Will I need a Magic Trackpad to take advantage of OS X Lion? From what I have read and/or seen about OS X Lion, it sounds like many of its new features rely on gestures.  I have a Mac Pro and do not have a trackpad of any kind.  Will I need to get a Magic Trackpad to take advantage of many of the new features in OS X Lion?  What kind of user experience can I expect in Lion if I don't have one?  What will I be missing out on?\n\nA: The only thing you wont be able to use, are the Multi-Touch Gestures.\n\nA: Generally, Stack Exchange network avoids talking about future products, but since Lion is going to be released very soon (according to a lot of sources), and having the GM installed on a computer next to me, I'd say that a multi-touch surface like the Trackpad or the Magic Mouse does add a lot of interesting possibilities to the UI. \nIf you're a regular OS X user and don't have a magic XXX, you will be able to do the same you do right now, you will be just missing the possibility to perform gestures that simplify your workflow. \nI personally cannot get used to it to be honest, but I'm a heavy keyboard oriented user, so the mouse is for those \"moments\" when the Keyboard doesn't cut it. \nI would recommend you go to the nearest Apple store and play with it for a while (i.e. more than 5 minutes). to see if you can get used to the concept of a trackpad surface.\n\nA: You won't be required to have a Magic Trackpad with Lion. But it will certainly add to your user experience, as you'll be able to use gestures. I bought one from Amazon (used, but in like new condition) just so I can experiment with the gestures on my Mac Pro.\nLet's not forget that it won't just be the OS that will benefit from the gestural repertoire. Many applications will also take advantage of the improved gestural support in Lion. And the number of applications that will add gestural support will increase once it becomes a core OS feature.\n", "Q: Can't time capsule back-up to an external hard-drive? I recently had connected an external hard-drive to an old 1st gen time capsule and successfully used it for backup. However, my TC began shutting down on me so I thought it was time to get a new one. Now my new TC will let me choose my external drive but as a backup but cannot seem to login to it. It keeps complaining \"problem with the network user name or password. However, I know this is right.\nIn the Mac Help doc, there is one section that reads:\n\nEvery available disk that can be used to store backups is listed. If you’ve partitioned a disk, the partitions are listed. Time Machine can’t back up to an external disk connected to an AirPort Extreme, or to an iPod, iDisk, or disk formatted for Windows.\n\nOK, so if this is true, why did it work before? Why does the app let me select the drive as \"Available\"? Could the reference in the Mac Help to AirPort Extreme refer to just the base station and not the time capsule?\n\nA: I used Apple's Express Lane tech support. (Being as this was a brand new TimeCapsule, there was no fee.) \nThe tech told me that TC no longer supports backup to an external drive as of the 2nd Gen TC. He would not speculate as to why.\nI can speculate that perhaps Apple wanted you to buy a bigger TC instead? Or perhaps (as was my experience) backing up to an external drive seemed to cause the TC to shut down (maybe overheated).\nHowever, I can and did hook the drive directly to my USB port and I can back up that computer to it using Time Machine software (which is what I wanted to do anyway.) \nOdd to answer my own question but this thread may provide an answer to the next guy.\n\nA: Is your external hard drive formatted as MS-DOS (a.k.a. FAT32)?\nTry reformatting it as Mac OS Extended, Journaled (a.k.a. HFS+J), with a GUID Partition Table (GPT) and see if it works that way.\nTime Capsules and AirPort Extremes share HFS+ volumes via both AFP (the Mac file sharing protocol) and SMB (the Windows file sharing protocol), but they only share FAT32 partitions via SMB.\nIt may be a bug in the Time Capsule firmware that it advertises a FAT32 volume as a potential Time Machine backup disk.\n", "Q: Drobo + Time Capsule I have a Time Capsule that I use for Time Machine, and am thinking about getting a regular entry level 4 slot Drobo to hang off its USB port as shared, non-Time Machine disk space.  The Drobo appeals to me because I can expand it as my needs grow, and because it has RAID-type functionality built in.  I figured that I could also unhook it from the Time Capsule and attach it to an individual machine should the need arise.\nHave you tried this before?  How has it worked out for you?\nEdit: Just to clarify, I was not looking to use it for Time Machine data.  The Time Capsule itself has plenty of disk space for my Time Machine backups.  I'm looking to add network based storage for general use (archiving videos, rarely used disc images, etc.)  I don't really need the performance of a Drobo FS, so I was looking to see if I could save some money with a regular Drobo.\n\nA: I've plugged in a Drobo S into the USB port on an Airport Extreme when I needed fast and dirty file sharing. It worked fine. It was only for a week, but I didn't notice any sort of unusual behavior. \nOnce you've done the initial setup/config via the Drobo interface, the drive acts just as standard USB drive. It's not the fastest thing in the world, but you're limited by the USB 2 anyways, so your experience regarding speed will depend more on your actual usage.\n\nA: I had planned to use my Drobo for Time Machine, but to do that you will want to partition the drobo into multiple logical drives so that Time Machine does not fill the entire machine with backups.\nHere is the relevant info on the Drobo web site explaining how to set it up. Drobo Fact #12: Which Drobo Should I Use with Time Machine?\n[Link removed]\n\"Time Machine for a Single Mac\nUsing Time Machine with Drobo is simple. Just setup the Drobo and then select it for Time Machine back use in the System Preferences. You want to create a separate partition for exclusive use by Time Machine. This way you can have a separate location and not co-mingle the Time Machine backup folders with other data. This article in the Knowledge Base provides more information: http://support.datarobotics.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/119/related/1/kw/time%20machine/r_id/100004\"\nThe newer Drobo products (Drobo FS/DroboPro FS/B800fs) have the idea of a \"Share\" which allows you to limit the amount of space Time Machine can use.\n[Link Removed]\n\nA: Here's my setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (mid 2009)\n\n*Drobo 4bay - Misc. Files\n\n*External Drive (I forget the manufacturer) with 2 partitions:\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine\n\n*Carbon Copy Cloner partition\n\n\n*Backblaze\nThis works great and provides lots of protection for my data.\n\n\n*\n\n*My laptop drive is backed up 3 times:\n\n\n*\n\n*A bootable clone (with a daily archive)\n\n*A time machine (which has hourly snapshots)\n\n*Backblaze remote backup.\n\n\n*My drobo is backed up only via Backblaze, but it has the redundancy of the RAID array.\nThis is a pretty sweet setup.  The only downside is how long it takes to backup the drobo over the net, since it tends to have large files (videos, games, etc.)\n\nA: Beware that when Mac OS X's Time Machine feature backs up to a local drive, it writes the files directly to the drive, but when it backs up to a remote AFP server over the network (such as a Time Capsule), it puts the backup inside a kind of disk image called a sparse bundle (or \".sparsebundle\"). So I don't think you can move a Time Machine target disk from a Time Capsule to a Mac (or vice-versa) and have it seamlessly continue to act as a Time Machine target disk.\nSo, if you primarily used it on the Time Capsule as a remote sparse bundle style Time Machine target disk, and then you moved it to your Mac, you could use it as a normal hard drive on your Mac, and you could manually mount the .sparsebundle file on your Mac, but I don't think you'd be able to get Time Machine to use the .sparsebundle when the Drobo is directly connected to your Mac.\n", "Q: How to check if internal HDD spindle is off after unmount I use SSD instead of optical drive in my Macbook MC516LL, so I have bunch of reasons why I wants to keep HDD's spindle off:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preserve HDD from shock\n\n*Reduce energy consuming\n\n*Reduce overall system temperature\n\n\nI use diskutil umount HD250 and it disappears from OSx.\nSo how can I  check if spindle turned off?\nThanks!\n\nA: diskutil umount HD250 - doesn't turn off spindle\ndiskutil eject HD250 - turn off spindle\nconfirmd by sound and mA usage\n", "Q: Mac OSX Mail Closes main window after hitting send Recently every time I compose an email, when I hit send not only does the mail compose window disappear (as expected) so does the main mail window... and then I have to click the dock icon to bring it back!  Ideas on why this has just started happening?\n\nA: When you check the logs in Console, you may find it convenient and more informative if you first select All Messages in the left column, then use the Filter blank/box in the upper right of that window and enter \"Mail\".\nThis should produce a list of all log entries relating to Mail only.  It may not pick up everything that is involved in creating the actions you see in Mail, but it will find most of them, and could help in giving a clue to the problem.  It does get rid of all the entries that are unrelated to the problem.\nWhen looking at these filtered messages, try to remember the last changes you made to the system.  Don't limit your thinking to changes in Mail, but think about all apps and add ons you installed. It's the unintended (and unknown) consequences that often cause such problems.  They sometimes don't reveal themselves until days later. \nA couple of other things to do that can often correct weird behavior, especially in apps native to the OS:\nSafe Boot, then immediately reboot normally without logging in.\nReinstall the OS Combo update.\nNeither of these is a sure cure, but used in the above order, will often fix this kind of problem.  About the only thing you learn from the exercise is that it can often cure the problem, and you still don't know what was wrong.\nWhatever you do, be methodical in your approach.  Try only one \"fix\" at a time, and then test for problems.  This is the easiest way to learn and improved your problem-solving skills. \n", "Q: How can I change a filetype’s “Kind” value in the Finder?

I'm thinking about getting a mounting bracket so I can record more video with my iPod Touch (4gen), but I wonder if I'll have enough space on it to hold very much.\nHow much space does recorded video take up on an iPod Touch, in gigabytes per hour (or whatever the appropriate units would be)?\n\nA: The recording is HD (720p) up to 30 frames per second with audio - but since both the audio and video are compressed using lossy algorithms, you might sometimes get significantly storage depending on the source.\nIn practice the iPhone 4 uses 4.8 GB / hour with the same HD (720p) up to 30 frames per second - but the few recording I've seen from the iPod touch have data rates about half as high (which use about half the space). My iPhone usually records between 2 and 10 Mbit/s. The lower end is for static, mostly black images and if things are moving or detailed, you get to the higher end of the range pretty easily.\nYou can make some test recordings and open them in QuickTime Player where the inspector window will show you the details for the video you are shooting.

Is USB or WIFI faster when syncing an iPhone 4 with iOS 5 to iTunes?\nThis SuperUser answer suggests that Wireless N might be faster than USB 2:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/288705/speed-comparison-usb-vs-wireless-n-vs-cat-6\nNote: iPhone 4 is 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi (802.11n 2.4GHz only)\n\nA: USB 2.0 is faster, but Wi-Fi is better.\nIn practice, Wi-Fi will be superior to USB for syncing and backup since you don't have to worry about plugging it in. It can start as soon as you enter the network, throttle itself based on CPU/iOS activity. You can even start on WiFi and connect your iOS 5 device to USB and syncing will continue at faster speeds if WiFi proves to be slow for a particular sync session.\nMy experience is the devices can do their thing and sync in the background without me waiting for them and I'm almost always the slowest peg in the process. :-)\nHowever, USB 2.0 speed is faster than 802.11n both in theory and in practice. See this chart from a very nice Apple Insider article on relative speeds relating to Time Capsule performance. The one area where USB (or any other wired connection whether it's USB 2.0, 3.0, FireWire or Thunderbolt) is better than Wi-Fi is latency. If your sync session is largely lots of little checks and no appreciable time is spent waiting for large files to transfer, then the wired connection could be much faster if your sessions are shorter than 15 to 30 seconds in length. Here's another nice article explaining how even a slow USB 2.0 connection can be fast enough for some demanding data transfers: http://www.apogeedigital.com/knowledgebase/quartet/why-doesnt-quartet-use-usb-3-0/\n\nAppleInsider: Exploring Time Capsule: theoretical speed vs practical throughput\n\nA: In my experience, syncing at a variety of times, with an 802.11n network, USB is approximately 4x faster than WiFi.\nIf you're in the middle of a WiFi sync and it's taking too long, you can connect the USB cable and the sync will complete over the (much) faster USB connection.\n\nA: Lifehacker did a pretty thorough write up of wireless syncing. In short - WiFi takes longer, but it's not too bad.\nEDIT: Giant caveat - they only tested this over 802.11g. I imagine USB might still be faster, just because even though the iPhone storage is flash, we don't really know what its actual write speeds are.\n\nWhile music and movies take 13 times longer over Wi-Fi than over USB, it's still a relatively short amount of time—6 and a half minutes for 4 albums isn't bad. If you aren't rushing out the door, it's certainly worth the \"not getting out of your chair\" factor, and if you're only syncing one or two albums, it'll be even faster. This benefit grows with something like the iPad, which is more difficult to just keep docked at your computer all the time—instead of finding it and bringing it to your computer all the time, you can just hit the sync button on either device and let it go to town.\nOverall, Wi-Fi syncing is mostly what we expected—a slower version of USB syncing. However, if you're syncing a small amount of media, it doesn't make a huge difference, and if you're syncing apps, there's almost no reason to plug in at all. Also keep in mind that we were using a wireless G network, and if you're on the newer wireless N standard, you might notice even faster Wi-Fi times. And with the ability to keep using your device while you sync, it is very freeing to have Wi-Fi sync around, as long as you don't have anywhere to be. Have you tried Wi-Fi sync on iOS 5 yet? Share your thoughts with us in the comments.\n\n\nA: In my experience, USB sync is much faster than WiFi sync over my 802.11n AirPort, which can become an issue when I've recorded video. I was hoping that WiFi syncing meant my phone would auto-sync whenever I arrive home, but in reality it does not start syncing until you plug it in to charge within WiFi range. The upside is: I now sync whenever I plug my phone into any power brick in the house.\n\nA: NEW: BETTER SOLUTION: \nIf set up optimally, is USB or WIFI faster when syncing an iPhone 4 with iOS 5 to iTunes?  \nWi-Fi is MUCH FASTER.\nLifehacker and company are wrong IF things are set up well/optimally!!\nOptimal: Use 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi ONLY between the iDevice and the router.  Use a wired (Fast or Gigabit) Ethernet connection or 5 GHz between the router and PC/Mac.\nUSB 2 is 12 Mbit/s (max), but one can sync over Wi-Fi 802.11n, at much higher speeds, if you avoid heavy contention for the Wi-Fi bandwidth.  I just ran some tests (6 test runs, plus warm-ups) and was seeing iTunes sync speeds close to USB 2's max over a cable, and 2-4 times that speed (26Mbps to 50 Mbps) when connecting via a wired (gigabit ethernet) to a router and then over Wi-Fi  to an iPhone 4S (that is, one wired hop and one wireless hop).  (When sending large files to the iPhone. Short distance, 2.4 GHz 802.11n.)  I also found that the basic no-op sync when nothing had changed was slightly faster over a well- configured Wi-Fi connection than over USB 2 (apple brand cable; no hub).\nWHY? Data sent purely over Wi-Fi via a Wi-Fi router between a PC/Mac and an iDevice will result in heavy contention, as the data has to make two wireless hops, and Wi-Fi routers generally don't buffer well in that situation  That's why a VoIP phone call using WiFi and bluetooth simultaneously is so often choppy: The WiFi and bluetooth are often competing for the same 2.4 GHz spectrum at the same time.  This is also why most folks are getting poor iTunes throughput with Wi-Fi.   \n\nA: If you're syncing over Wifi it will all depend on what else is going on in your network. If it's dead of night and all the other computers are asleep it'll probably be wifi. Some other times it'll be USB. Keep in mind that there's no more syncing screen on USB syncs so you can still do whatever you want while the device is syncing.\n", "Q: View All Assigned Keyboard Shortcuts Is there a way (probably an app) that lets you see all global (and possibly local) keyboard shortcuts that have been defined? Something similar to ActiveHotkeys on Windows.

When I first run it after every reboot or waking up, it painfully takes > 7 min to load. The same actually happens the second time or even third time I load it anew on the same session. Next times, however, loads rather fast. \nWhen already loaded, eclipse seems to go just fine, but when running (very simple) Java programs, the JVM virtual machine typically loads also slowly.\nSuspecting the problem was with Java, I tested running simply java without any parameter whatsoever (that is, it prints the help) after a reboot, and it takes also minutes. Following runs go well.\nAs for other Java programs, the game Minecraft loads relatively fast but then the game goes quite slow.\nSo I could think that the problem is with Java but, however, I'm experimenting a similar problem when uncompressing zipped files, using both the Archiver program that comes with Snow Leopard and with TheUnarchiver (they are not Java!).

Textastic works with SFTP.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut for inserting MathType equations in Pages? I have more and more thoughts about taking my class notes on my computer, and Pages '09 would seem like a good candidate for that task. However, being that I have a lot of technical classes, I find myself needing to insert MathType equations very often.\nIs there a keyboard shortcut to insert such an equation? If not, can I somehow make one?\n\nA: Update for 2019: The newer versions of Pages actually recently added equation support! Just go to Insert > Equation... or hit ⌥⌘E.\nIt uses LaTeX or MathML, but if you want to use MathType there's apparently a button for that in the resulting dialog, or you can set it to be your default. (I don't have MathType, so I can't test this.)\nThe Apple Support page has more information.\n\nA: FastScripts is my choice to easily make key shortcuts for accessing menu items - much nicer, more flexible and far more powerful than the keyboard preference pane. Also, LaunchBar works wonders for fast switching apps / activating services and learns your preferred key shortcuts on the go rather than having to program them in beforehand (but you can do that too if you like).\n", "Q: Are there any GPS recording applications for the iPhone? I was wondering if there was an iPhone application that would continuously read the GPS location and save it for later analysis. For example, I would like to be able to tell where I was at certain point of time, or how long did it take me to travel from one place to another.\nIs there such an app?\n\nA: There are a ton of 'em; Cyclemeter, Strava, MotionX, and many, many, others to name a few.\nMost have an export option that'll spew out a gpx file (or one of a different format) that you can then do whatever you want with.\n(I personally use Cyclemeter for recording and sharing bike rides -- there are many others that are more customized to other kinds of activity)\n\nA: My personal favourite is Kinect GPS (iTunes Link).\nIt's described as a swiss army knife for GPS tracking and I tend to agree. I had originally bought it to track backwoods bike rides but quickly found myself using it for all kinds of tracking: walks, runs, even car drives.\nThey have a modular approach to configuring the application. You can slice and view the data in all kinds of ways thanks to the pluggable interface. Analyze it over time for peaks, overlay it on a map. Very cool stuff.\nAnd important to me: you can export your data in one of three common formats.\n\nA: mshamma\nI know this is an old thread, but I wanted to respond...\nI too actually wanted an app to continuously track myself (on iPhone) in the background, each day, and without draining my battery too much... I used Google Latitude for a while which I found great, but they sadly discontinued it... the only downside of that was that I had to give my location data to a big tech company (not the end of the world, but I'd prefer not to)... in the end I took the long route and actually decided to build an app myself to do exactly what I (and I think you) wanted...\n\n*\n\n*It continuously tracks iPhone user's location all day each day\n\n*Lets you search by date (or area) to see your movements\n\n*Battery drain typically only 2%-4% for entire day\n\n*All location data stays local on the device (so only accessible by the user)\n\nIt's called 'Location Log', and I've made it it free to download (for now at least)\nhttps://apps.apple.com/gb/app/location-log/id1543208785\nIt's my first ever app, so now doing the rounds and trying to respond to any forum requests for such an app\n\nA: runkeeper has this functionality. i don't believe that you can access the raw gps data though.\n\nA: I would recommend Runmeter as the best tool for getting raw tracking data. (it's the same as walkmeter / cyclemeter - so pick the color and icon you prefer)\nIt comes pre-loaded with at least 16 activity types and you can control all sorts of activities (motorcycle / kayak / cross country ski / downhill ski). You can add or delete these as you wish, so it's very user friendly and customizable.\nThe developer responds quickly to support questions and it seems designed to give you your data and not force you into using one web service or locking you in to a corporate database. (ahem - yes I'm thinking of you, Nike+)\nHere is a chart I've found to be fair and accurate comparison of what the app can do compared to other running GPS apps that I have actually used. (but do note it's made by the company that made Runmeter - hone in on the things you need and ignore the rest - like if you don't really care about twitter integration)\nIt also is easy to use on it's own with mapping, graphs as well as integrating with a large handful of popular social sharing services if that is your preference. Lastly, it has no subscription and you don't need to make any in-app purchases if you don't want more than one voice (and even that isn't needed to get the data out of the app.)\nAfter each activity, you can configure it to email you a link to a kml file for additional processing as well as transfer the files through iTunes and USB.\nHere's one shot of the detail you can have over the GPS tracking if you wish.\n\n\nA: Xtrail will track your location in the background and plot your route on a map, although it is exercise-focused.\nCurrently on sale for $5, iPhone and iPad: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xtrail/id382807586?mt=8\n\nA: Both Google Maps and the stock Maps application for iOS do this. Google's is a little better but Apple's is built into the OS. The only problem with the Apple solution is that it will only show you places that you \"frequent\".\n\nA: ViewRanger will track you as you walk, it can use several types of map including OpenStreetMap and also several premium paid for maps, all of which are better than Apple or Google for walking in that they show more footpaths\nMany other do this you want apps that export gpx files\n", "Q: Get url of enbedded flash video on iPad Before you jump on me I know flash is not supported on the iPad. I just want to know how I can get the url (if possible) of these embedded videos.\n\nA: I haven't used the app, but WebInspector looks like it will show you the source. You might find that the servers are sniffing the user agents, and they don't even send you the link, but you can try the free version (ad supported) before spending any money on the app to be sure it does what you wish.\n", "Q: iPhone 3GS headphone sound is crackly I have a problem with the sound from the headphone jack on my iPhone 3GS. Sound from the speaker is fine, but the sound from the headphone jack (on any headphones) is distorted at normal volumes. If I turn the volume down to about halfway then the distortion vanishes but the volume becomes barely audible.\nI've just replaced the headphone jack with a brand new assembly, so it's not a problem with jack itself.\nAnyone have any ideas?\n\nA: Gonna say if you take it to Apple, they will confirm the audio processing chip on the mobo has maybe become faulty. Seen this before, took it to Apple, the chip responsible for audio processing had fried itself (not sure how). They replaced my iPhone.\n", "Q: Differences between Amazon Kindle3 and iPod Touch Kindle app? I don't know exactly how long I can read books on Amazon Kindle3.\nBut I can read books on it for very long time without charging.\n\nHow long can I read books on iPod Touch Kindle app without charging?\n\nDoes Kindle for iPod Touch have the english dictionary function like Amazon Kindle?\n\nDoes Kindle for iPod Touch also support audible?\n\nWhich device is easier to use and read?\n\nAre there other differences between Amazon Kindle3 and iPod Touch with Kindle?\n\nA: How long can I read books on iTouch Kindle without charging?\n\nThis will depend on the generation of the iPod touch you have. Newer generations have better battery life. This should be slightly more (+2 to +4 hours) than the video playback battery life of the device listed below:\n\n\n*\n\n*1st generation: 5 hrs\n\n*2nd generation: 6 hrs\n\n*3rd generation: 6 hrs\n\n*4th generation: 7 hrs\n\n\nIt is modest in comparison to the battery life the kindle has.\nDoes iTouch Kindle have the english dictionary function like Amazon Kindle?\n\nYes it does. When you need to look up a word, select it and long press. The first time, the dictionary will download over a wi-fi connection. The second time on, it will look up the word without the need of an internet connection. Personnally, I've found the dictionary to not be very extensive.\nDoes iTouch Kindle also support audible?\n\nNot sure what you're asking for here. I've never used a feature that has read out the content to me from the Kindle iPod touch and haven't seen an option for it either.\nWhich device is easier to use and read?\n\nDefinitely the Kindle device, since you're comparing which is better to read with.\nAre there other differences between Amazon Kindle3 and iTouch Kindle?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Supported formats: The iPod touch Kindle 2.7 doesn't support common formats like epub and pdf.\n\n*Readability: The Kindle is larger and more suitable for reading. It's E Ink Pearl technology which displays everything in gray-scale, reduces glare and doesn't strain the eyes during long uses.\n\n*Additional functions: The iPod touch can do much more that be a e-book reader. The number of apps available on the app store extends it capability. You also have the option to replace the Kindle on the iPod touch with other e-book reader apps like iBooks.\n\n", "Q: IMac freezing intermittently--every few minutes. How can I fix this? A couple of days ago, I was browsing, and downloading something from Usenet, when my iMac all of a sudden froze up, grinding to an unbearable slowness.  After trying to tolerate what was happening for 5 minutes, hoping it would pass, I finally gave up, and restarted the computer manually.  To my horror, for about a day, I was plagued with the interminable locked up gray Apple startup screen, but thankfully the next morning, left it on from a  restart to find later that the computer had managed to boot up to a login screen, everything seemingly fixed.\nThat was background.  Now I have a different problem: My iMac is subjecting me to intermittent freezing episodes; I will be writing, or browsing in peace for a few minutes, before everything locks up, save for perhaps only the cursor.   When the hanging is finished, the computer then resumes the missed operations (typing, etc.) in a hurry, as if one were watching a fast-forwarded video.   Each hanging episode lasts from anywhere from 5 seconds to upwards of a minute; moreover, the system pops a window telling me that I don't have enough disk space for memory, though Finder consistently tells me I have upwards of 30GB worth of space (on a 250 GB HD).   There's also another curiosity: When I tried using Software Update to update everything — trying to fix this problem — upon Restart it told it couldn't install a recent Security Update because \"the source media [you?] are installing from is damaged.\"\nWhat's my causing my problems? How can I fix them? Unlike a previous related question, I don't think this has anything to do with Youtube or my browser; closing near every window, including Chrome, has no solved the problem, or mitigated it in any way.   I was also wondering could it perhaps do with something I downloaded -- could Trojans somehow associated with the movie I was downloading have anything to do with this problem?  I'd really appreciate some help on this; this freezing has rendered a significant part of my workflow virtually unusable, and I don't consider myself very computer savvy.\n\nA: It's very unlikely you downloaded something or broke everything with one download. Also - with at least 4 things not working well - please protect your pictures, emails just in case it's a hardware failure.\nWhen only one thing is broken - it's often worthwhile to poke, learn, understand what broke and look for a fix of that one issue.\nFor any group of three or more problems, there's one solution that always works (and often saves a lot of time):\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up anything you can't afford to loose and get someone who is a bit tech savvy to verify you have a workable backup that you can restore if needed.\n\n*Erase the mac and install just a clean system from the media that came with the mac. \n\n\nThis will quickly let you know if the hardware has failed. It will also solve nearly all software issues. Once you have surfed the web, made sure it is reliable, then you can run updates, restore your personal files and get on knowing it was just some corruption of the software.\nDon't feel bad getting help from someone (even paid) if your savvy is for things other than a computer. A good tech can erase and install Mac OS X in 10 to 30 minutes. A good tech might take 4 hours to 4 days to pick apart all the things that could be wrong and tell you what happened. With multiple issues, it's hard to tell what was the root cause and what was just a subsequent failure.\nIt's often so much easier and efficient to just clean up the mess, start fresh, and keep an eye for any sign of the problems recurring. You will then have better data on the problem. You will also have a backup of your important files.\nSince your computer can't tell if it has enough memory to run, (or is truly out of space) you can't really trust itself to fix itself which is why I jumped right to backup / restore for anyone on a situation as you describe. Also, if you were to determine exactly what broke, and did the fixes right, if it freezes or doesn't complete your fix - you will still be in the same badly working situation.\nBest of luck - some good people have made answers with great advice here as to what could be wrong. I wanted to weigh in with a different sort of advice since no-one (you included) had mentioned protecting your data files.\n\nA: You should check the Console logs.\nMy computer displayed these exact symptoms. The console logs displayed this error:\nkernel[0]: disk0s2: I/O error\n\nAfter reformatting the hard drive and locking out bad sectors, they went away for a time. Alas, they came back, and it seems I'll have to replace the hard drive which is likely failing.\nIn your particular case, you may be able to correlate the times of \"stuttering\" with errors in the log and determine what is causing the freezing. Good luck.\n\nA: If this is something that's now happening regularly then it's likely a failed hardware component (which can get expensive if you don't have AppleCare (Pro Tip: go buy AppleCare and register your computer NOW (unless your Mac is more than 3 years old))). But it could easily simply be a corrupted filesystem. Boot from your Mac OS X install disk and run Disk Utility. Select your hard disk and run Repair on it.\nIf this is something that doesn't happen frequently (i.e., it happens several times in a row, but long intervals where it doesn't happen at all) then it could be a heat issue (you can enjoy the humor in heat causing your Mac to freeze). There are some temperature monitors that can run in the menu bar. Install one of them and keep an eye on it. If anything gets close to above about 175° F then it's too hot. Also, if the ambient temperature in the room your Mac is in is above 95° F it's likely that the internal temp of your Mac is too hot. Turn on the AC, buy some and point them at it, etc. Do anything you can to cool it down.\nAlso be aware that prolonged excessive heat can cause serious and permanent damage to your system.\nBut if it's not heat, then it's probably hardware. Backup your Home directory and take it to Apple.\n\nA: Boot from the Restore DVD and check the drive. When all is fine create a new user and see if the problem exsist while logged in with that new (clean) User.\nCase Problem gone? Softwareproblem.\nTime for Try and Error: Move all Prefs and Application Support items out of the Library of the Account and see if the problem is gone. Move the items back in groups till you know what item/pref cause the freezes. Basically you need to find the difference between the working user and the freezing user.\nCase Problem not gone? What Bahamat said. Take it to repair.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my IMAC. It turned out to be bad hard drive. I had bad experience with Genius bar at local apple store and local big stores to fix it. So I took it to a small local computer repair store. They replaced it with new hard drive and I am very happy ever since. HTH.\n", "Q: How to have multiple (wireless) network profiles? is the following scenario possible in Mac OSX?\nI want to assign specific TCP/IP configurations for different wireless networks that I connect to, and I want the system to remember the settings.\nFor example:\nWhen I'm at work, I have two networks that I frequently connect to and switch between. The first one is the internet-enabled network, the TCP/IP settings in this network is configured automatically using DHCP. The second one is the internal testing network, this network is not connected to the internet and the TCP/IP settings must be configured manually.\nEvery time I switch between them, I set the TCP/IP settings manually from Networks preference pane. Since I do this quite frequently, it gets quite annoying. Moreover, I can't use cables because I need to be mobile when I use the internal network. I want the configuration to be automatically configured for every known wireless network.\nIs there a way to do this, or are there any third-party tools for this?\n\nA: You can set up 'Locations' using System Preferences-> Network, which should do what you need.\nIn the Network System Preferences panel, you'll see (at the top) a pop-up menu labeled Location. It will be set to Automatic. Click that menu and choose Edit Locations...\nClick the [+] button in the panel that appears. Name your new Location. Click Done.\nMake sure the new Location is selected under the Location: menu, and set it up.\nThen, when you need to change back to the other setup, change the location back to Automatic (or rename Automatic something more descriptive). When you need to change again, switch back to your new one.\n\nA: \"Airport Location takes snapshots of the system settings you select and re-applies them the next time you use your machine at that location. The author's description: \n\nAirport Location is a small menubar app for Snow Leopard laptops and\n  desktops. When you ask it to it records dozens of settings by taking a\n  Snapshot of your computer just the way it is setup at that time. You\n  can have as many Snapshots as you want – one for Travel, one for\n  Office, one for Home, one for watching Movies etc..\"\n\n\nA: Try this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"System Preferences\" -> Network.\n\n*On the left pane, click on + to create a new service.\n\n*Call it let's say \"Wi-Fi Work\", and configure it once as per your needs.\n\n*Then right click on service button next to + and - in the left pane, and select Make Service Inactive menu item.\n\n*Redo steps 2 to 4 as much as you have different profiles.\n\n\nThen, whenever you want to activate a profile, instead of reconfiguring it, you just go and select it to make it active.\n", "Q: Which books should I read to use and understand Mac OS well? I had been using Windows for over 10 years.\nBut I'm a beginner of using Mac OS.\nWhich books should I read to use and understand OS X very well.\n\nA: I was in the same position ¾ years ago and went ahead and loaned Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Missing Manual (Pogue, David. O'Reilly).\nIt introduced all basic things what an imaginary OS X Snow Leopard manual could had included, albeit it isn't written in a conventional manual style. It is good for OS X newbies, as I was, because it explains even some rather elementary features/operations.\nThe Missing Manual doesn't cover Windows vs. OS X in a too great detail, which is, in my opinion, good thing as it makes you learn OS X from the ground up and makes you work with your operating system more intuitively (ie. you don't think Windows operations first and then translate them to Mac OS operations, but rather think of how things are done in the Mac OS straight away).\nThe downside was that the basic aspects of OS X were rather easy to learn with 10+ years of experience of other operating systems. It also introduced the majority of bundle apps, of which some were uninteresting to me (like iChat). The book was relatively fast to skim through.\nThe best part was the 6-page keyboard shortcut appendix to which I returned more times than any other chapter.\nI can recommend the book — perhaps not to be bought, but to be read. If your local library has it in its collection, it's worth a visit.\nNote that OS X Lion is due to be released later in this month. I strongly recommend to hold back buying the book now: either wait for a massive price drop or buy the book used; or wait for Lion books to land, if you're about to upgrade.\n\nA: Check out Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Snow Leopard Edition:\n\nIs Windows giving you pause?

All my notification settings are turned on but like I said they only work occasionally. Does anyone know how to fix this so they work everyday all the time?\n\nA: Is your iDevice jailbroken?\nIf it is you could potentially use Push Doctor to fix the push problems you're having.\n\nA: Which notifications are you not getting all the time. I know that there are some applications that aren't written properly or are written in a way that you wouldn't expect that cause you not to get a notification when you think you will. For instance, Facebook. If you're on facebook on your computer and you get a notification it doesn't get pushed to your phone right away, it'll wait a bit to see if you're actually going to check it another way first before sending it to the phone.\n\nA: You should change your DNS to 8.8.8.8.\n", "Q: Why does iPad show a weird effect on some PDF images? I noticed some PDF documents viewed on iPad (either version 1 or 2) show a weird effect as follows. There are thin lines distracting the image.\n\nYou can see the details on YouTube: Weird image shown on iPad 1 and iPad 2.\nWhy does iPad show a weird effect on some PDF images?\n\nA: Though I can't say for certain without examining the actual PDF (or at least that page), I suspect the apparent artifacts -- the lines -- are the result of the image containing an imperfect grid of pixels, probably due to a slight resizing. \nI created an example to demonstrate the idea. It doesn't reproduce exactly what you're seeing on the iPad, but the concept is the same.\nHere are two grids of black and white pixels, one perfect and one imperfect. Zoomed at 600% you can clearly see the difference between them:\nPerfect Pixel Grid (600% Zoom)\n\nImperfect Pixel Grid (600% Zoom)\n\nIf you look at those same images at their original size they look about the same:\nPerfect Pixel Grid (100% Zoom)\n\nImperfect Pixel Grid (100% Zoom)\n\nHowever, if you resize them the way the iPad does, effectively putting the pixels at the nearest spot it can find after you change the size, you can see the difference easily -- basically the math doesn't work out perfectly because you can perform zooming of any percentage with the gesture. The effect is called aliasing:\nPerfect Pixel Grid with Aliased Zoom\n\nImperfect Pixel Grid with Aliased Zoom\n\n", "Q: Save an app for later download? I am looking for a way to create a wish list in the App Store, like you can in iTunes on the desktop. \nIs it possible to do this on the App Store from an iPhone?\n\nA: That is actually a feature I've seen with \"third party\" app stores but never in the official App Store itself. I did however just check and I guess the closest in relevancy is the feature to \"Tell A Friend\". I presume you could simply tell yourself by emailing the direct link for that App Store application.\n\nA: Click the arrow next to the price and select \"Add to Wish List\".\n", "Q: How to add Spotlight comments to the bundled OS X apps?

I want to know how many times can i charge iPad2 Battery.\nI heard that iPad Battery can recharge 1000 times.\nif recharge 1000 times over,that battery will be damage.\nIs that right?\nPlease tell me about ipad battery.\n\nA: Apple has a great page on batteries and it does say that they are designed to still have 80% of their capacity remaining after 1000 charge cycles.\nNot all batteries are perfect, so you could have problems even on the second charge. Heat, always having it charged and deep discharge can also cause them to fail or wear out before you get to 1000 charges.\nDon't confuse an isolated failure or anecdotal evidence for the overall statistics for a million devices seen as a group. Also, damage like wetness or other failures of the electronics can bring down a perfect battery so it's hard to know what might cause a specific failure without taking it apart.\n\nA: I have been using a the battery in my ipad for ten years and I still get a good 8 hours out of it :-)\n", "Q: How to \"block\" calls? How do we \"block\" calls such that no one is able to call through?\nFor example, I would not like anyone to call me for the next 60 minutes, but I do not wish to turn off the phone.\nWhat's the best solution?\n\nA: You have four options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on Do Not Disturb and lock the screen (or configure it to block all calls whether the screen is locked or not on iOS 7)\n\n*Place the phone in AirPlane mode - this disables the cellular data, SMS and cellular calls as well as WiFi. You can turn on WiFi while in AirPlane mode to access data and still be undisturbed.\n\n*Use your carrier to start call forwarding. It will send your calls to another number (google voice is a nice place to send them if you don't have another appropriate line). On AT&T, you dial the following to start forwarding, call: **21*1234567890# - assuming your other number is (123)456-7890. To stop the forwarding, call #21#\n\n*Remove the sim. If you have another sim (same carrier or unlocked phone) that would in effect turn off your primary phone service without deactivating the phone. \n\n\nA: Ask you cellular carrier how to forward calls.

I am planning to buy an iPhone, but the one thing missing is FM radio. \nIs there a way to listen to FM radio on the iPhone?\n\nA: There's no good public answer for this question. There is an FM radio in the iPod Nano, but leaving it out of the iPhone is clearly a design decision. There may have been issues with chip suppliers, but I suspect that had Apple wanted to have an FM radio in the device, those issues would have been dealt with.\nIt's somewhat more likely that Apple sees FM radio versus material it sells or rents via the iTunes Store as a zero-sum game. Consuming more of the former makes it somewhat less likely that the latter will be purchased.\nGiven the famous Apple disdain for focus groups and market research, it's probably most likely that someone in an iPhone design meeting said \"Hey, who listens to FM radio?\" and got no reply, so that feature was cut\n\nA: I realize your question is for a broadcast FM radio app but why not get your radio content through streaming? I use three excellent apps for streaming radio content on both iPhone and iPad:\nPandora for music: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pandora-radio/id284035177?mt=8\nTuneIn radio for NPR and other talk: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tunein-radio-pro/id319295332?mt=8\nYou can also get NPR news broadcasts through their NPR news app: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/npr-news/id324906251?mt=8\n", "Q: Pages: Can I create text variables like in inDesign? I've found Pages simply great and very useful on making documents for idendity scopes, very lighter and faster than InDesign for medium-small documents.\nThe only thing I missing inside it are the text variables.\nWell, this is the name used in InDesign, I'm talking about the creation of text pieces, inserted inside the text areas, this is very useful, if you need redundant informations, like client name and project name.\nDoes it exist in Pages?\n\nA: Sure, at least with the new version of Pages this is possible by using tables. You enter the value that you want to repeat into one (single field) table and you add a formula into the other (single field) table by entering = and then clicking into the source table (the first one). The result is a formula similar to this:\n= Table 1::A1\nThis way the content of field A1 in table 1 is shown / repeated in table 2.\nHowever, this does not work inline - only for full lines / paragraphs.\nBut if you want the same information (e.g. the document title) to be shown on each page or on several places in the document, this will do the trick.\n\nA: I'm afraid not, which is a shame.\nI think your best bet would be to use a program like TextExpander ($35, trial available).\nYou can use that to define 'variables' (called 'snippets' by TE, which means something entirely different in InDesign...) like this:\nYou type c1 and it automatically changes to Name Of Client 1 (you'd fill in the actual name).\nYou can also automatically fetch things like date last modified by setting up a 'snippet' that runs a shell script or AppleScript.\nSuch a snippet could work like this: You type doc1mod and it would run a script you write (I can help you with that part if you want) that will find the date last modified for a document and replace doc1mod with that date.\nThis isn't as powerful or convenient as InDesign text variables, but the end result should come close. TextExpander isn't cheap, but I've found it worth the investment.\n\nA: No - mail merge is the closest thing to a variable, and it wants to pull from Address Book or a numbers spreadsheet and generate multiple versions of one master document. Much different than reusing text from elsewhere within the same document.\nMost heavy Pages users I know get Text Expander or plan old find/replace to speed up repetitive common text in a document.\n", "Q: Why can't I hear my alert sounds or ringer? For some reason, the sounds for ringers, and alerts/notifications on my mother's iPhone appear to not be playing anymore.  Even though the ringer volume in settings is turned up almost to the max, the phone still only vibrates when receiving a call.  And when the phone is placed onto it's charging dock, instead of BEEP ing like it normally does, it simply vibrates.\nInterestingly, when I fiddle with the ringer volume slider in settings, the test ringtone plays just fine, and music audio can also be played through the built in speaker.\nWhat's going on?\n\nA: I would first check to see if the silent switch on the phone, above the volume buttons, is active. That would cause the issue. If that's not the case (the switch is off), I would try powering the phone down (hold down power button at top, then slide to power off), then restarting it.\n", "Q: iSight vs Facetime HD (Macbook vs Macbook Pro) While checking the tech specs I see iSight on Mac book and FaceTime HD on Mac book pro.\nI tried finding solution myself through google and sources but found no justifiable response.\nCan some one tell me the difference ?\n\nA: The only official specifications I can find on the FaceTime HD camera is that they send 720p HD signal whereas the iSight cameras recorded 640x480.\n", "Q: Connecting to IP takes longer than name I'm seeing behavior from my mac mini that is confusing me, I'm hoping someone else has seen this before;\nWhen connecting to my mac mini from my macbook pro, connecting to the computer name is instant but connecting to the IP takes several seconds (10-15). This seems counter-intuitive to me, because connecting to a name involves the extra step of looking up the name I would think that connecting to the IP would be instant.\nDoes anyone know why this is, or how to eliminate the delay?\n\nA: This is just a guess, but when you use the IP address it may try to do a reverse DNS lookup to get the associated name, and take a while to time out.\n\nA: When you connect by name you're probably connecting to the IPv6 link local address instead of the v4 address.\n", "Q: what is the difference between a Movie and a TV Show in iTunes Library? what is the difference between a Movie and a TV Show in iTunes Library?\n\nA: The only difference between those two categories is how iTunes groups things by default. In the Movies view, there's not grouping. All movies are displayed alphabetically by default. In the TV Show view things are grouped by show -- so you get a single icon for each show and you drill down to access the episodes within the show.\n", "Q: TextMate: How can I switch 2 lines? I recently migrated over from Notepad++ (and from Windows) and I am finding myself at an inconvenience without CTRL + T in Notepad++ which switches the current line with the previous line. I tried using Move selection (CMD + CTRL + ARROW), but it does not behave the same way.\n\nA: It's the same as in Notepad++, control ⌃+T. Place your cursor at the beginning of the second line, press ⌃ T, and the two lines will be transposed. Your cursor will also move down a line as well, enabling you to repeatedly transpose to move a line down several spots.\n\nA: You can also use control ⌃+↑ and control ⌃+↓.\nWorks from any point of the line, but will yield strange results if the line you're on has no line ending character.\n", "Q: Macs on wireless network can't see eachother I've got an iMac and Macbook Pro, both running Snow Leopard and both on my home wireless network (running off a Linksys E2000). They both can get online fine, both have file sharing enabled, neither have a firewall enabled, and they both have IPs on the same subnet (192.168.1.144 & 146). Yet neither one can seem to see the other. If I open the network browser in Finder it's empty, attempts to go to the other machines IP directly fail after a long timeout, and even trying to ping the other machine fails. Yet, strangely, I've been able to get services like Synergy working just fine between them. Any ideas as to why these two machines are so inconsistent about talking to eachother?\n\nA: I have almost the same setup except that I have an E3000 but I'm not running Synergy.  My Macs can ping each other and share files.  I have IPV6 turned off.  You may have tried some of my suggestions but let see if any of them will help the cause.\nI have file sharing enabled on both Macs and I can see my other on-net mac in the Finder Sidebar under Shared.  My Sidebar Preference under Shared allows connected servers and Bonjour computers.  With these settings, can either Finder see the other Mac?  It's good to verify this on both machines as a control.  If you can see either machine, you should be able to double-click to log in.\nIf not, please turn off Synergy then reboot each mac and see what comes up in Finder.\nMake sure your E2000 basic wireless is set to mixed.\nI did not use Cisco Connect opting to configure my E3000 manually and I'm not running WPS (WiFi Protected Setup).  If you are running WPS, temporarily disable it to rule it out as a potential cause.  On my E3000, I have configured any MAC access lists and access point isolation is disabled.\nTemporarily disable any security option under Wireless Security for both the 2.4G and the 5G settings.  \nSave router settings.\nReboot each mac and see what comes up in Finder.  This will help us see if this is a Mac, Synergy or Cisco issue.\n\nA: Okay, this is really random and bizarre but after a second power-cycle of my router suddenly everything started talking again, good as new! I'm honestly pretty stumped by what happened here, and annoyed that this didn't resolve itself on the first power-cycle I tried, but all's well that ends well I guess.\nIf anything I'm sorry that I didn't come out of this with better advice for people with the same problem down the road. Good luck, future network debuggers, 'cause I don't have any advice for you! :P\n\nA: I had similar issues with a Linksys E2000 router... the Macs on WiFi could ping the router, an iPad, Linux machines and various infrastructure but could not ping each other and could not be pinged from anything else. This was despite OSX Firewall being turned OFF.\nAccording to Wireless>>Advanced Wireless Settings the AP Isolation option was Disabled. Just for a laugh I Enabled it, Saved Settings, Disabled it again and Saved Settings. Lo and behold the Macs could ping each other and could be pinged by everything else.\nHope this helps someone else.\n", "Q: I can't save my system preferences I can't save my dock and spaces setting. Every time I set them (eg. disable spaces), after I reboot/re-login to the system, the dock and spaces settings will revert back to the previous status. How can I fix this problem?\n\nA: I've solved it. Change the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist to be unlocked (get info, uncheck the locked label) and it will work fine. I don't remember when I locked it, but whatever.\n\nA: Try using a terminal command, like defaults to change your preferences.

Is it possible to split windows horizontally and or vertically on Textmate nowadays? Probably someone out there made a kind of Plugin for this :-/ Like C-x 2 when I'm on GNU Emacs to split horizontally or C-x 3 to split vertically and have flexible control on each windows' width or :split on ViM.\n\nA: As far as I know this feature is still not possible. Mind you many people have discussed this and it is a very south-out feature http://wiki.macromates.com/Suggestions/GUI.\n\nA: The only thing I could find is seandunn/window-buddy.tmbundle - GitHub:\n\nWindow Buddy is a bundle to add basic window management to TextMate\nSorry but... WORK IN PROGRESS!\nCurrently it's a bit rough and incomplete but the aim is to provide pseudo split window editing by using auxiliary windows in TextMate.\n\n\nA: You can open a file in two windows at once. Whatever edits you do in one window are performed in the other as well. It's not quite the same as a single split-view window, but it's not all that different either.\n", "Q: Is there a way I can import ReadItLater's exported html file into my Instapaper? Is there a way I can import my ReadItLater's exported html file into my Instapaper?\n\nA: Though I don't have a tool now, I guess it can be done in couple of ways. Yes, no one click solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Email each url to your personal instapaper id (Refer this Lifehacker article)\n\n*Can parse your export list and use simple API from Instapaper to add the links to your account.

Here is the link http://minus.com/mc3va2C\nUpdate 2:\nThe source of the extension is available @ https://github.com/palaniraja/RIL2Insta \n\nA: No, there is no way of doing this. With those applications.\n", "Q: How can I disable Photos on my iPad 2? I want to disable photos icon in my iPad 2, but I don't know how to do that. I want to disable like Movies. I can disable Movies in General's Restriction, but I can't find how to disable Photos.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: There is no built-in support for disabling specific apps on iOS. However, there is a specific software for this (and costs $$$), but requires jailbreaking.\nCurrently the best way to jailbreak an iPad 2 is through JailbreakMe. It is really simple, just launch it in Safari and follow the steps.\nAfter installing, launch Cydia. Navigate to the Cydia Store and purchase iProtect. After purchasing and activating it you should be able to \"lock\" your individual apps, such as the Photos application.\n", "Q: How to move rent movies from iPod Touch to iMac? I moved rented movies from my iMac to my iPod Touch with iTunes to watch them outside, but now I want to watch some of them at home.\nI tried to drag the rented movie in iPod Touch to iMac with iTunes, but nothing happened.\nHow do I move rented movies from an iPod Touch to an iMac?\n\nA: According to the FAQ - you should be able to move a rental that was first purchased and downloaded to a Mac as many times as you wish - but it can only be on one device at any point in time. You need to be connected to the internet when you move the rental file.\nIn your case, just find the rental on the device in iTunes and transfer it back to the iTunes library.\nExpand the section named - Can I play my rental on more than one device? for the exact wording by Apple on this.\nIf you rented it on iOS - It's not possible without cracking the DRM as rentals from iOS or AppleTV stay on that one device and cannot be transferred.\n\nA: If I'm not mistaken, I think you can use AirPlay from iPod Touch to your iMac. If it's not officially supported by Apple, then check out this Jailbreak app.\n", "Q: Equivalent to Windows' Baretail Is there any alternative to Windows' Baretail?\nWhat I am looking for is a graphical Baretail?\nActually, I don't really care that it is graphical but I want to be able to have colors (lines with ERROR in red, lines with WARNING in yellow and so on...)\nAnd I want it to behave like a \"perfect\" tail -f command meaning that I want it to be non-invasive (does not prevent the file deletion).\nBut always on the watch (if a file is deleted, and recreated and re-written in it then the tool would just start showing it again).\nIn any case, any tool that does a better graphical interpretation of tail -f is welcome.\n\nA: Multitail \nInstall with \nbrew install multitail\n\n\n\nA: I've been using \"Console\" as a general log viewer.  (Comes with the Mac as a system utility)\nYou can open up files and it'll act like tail but then also has filter abilities.  No color coding (that i'm aware of)... \n\nA: This is an alternative, Glogg, and it is expected to  be released for Mac soon. \nI couldn't find much more than this.\n\nA: While it does not do colorization, if you use tail -F (big F as opposed to little f), the tail activity will continue following a file if it's deleted and/or truncated and replaced with a new file of the same name.\nVerbatim from the tail(1) man page:\n-F\nThe -F option implies the -f option, but tail will also check to see if the file being followed has been renamed or rotated.  The file is closed and reopened when tail detects that the filename being read from has a new inode number.  The -F option is ignored if reading from standard input rather than a file.\n\nA: I know this is an old question but finally a more modern one is under development.  See Tail Blazer\nDisclaimer: this is an open source project and I am the developer\n", "Q: Identify connected external disks programmatically I want to write a shell script that ejects all currently-connected external drives (either USB or Firewire drives). I can use the disktuil eject <disk-path> to eject a specified drive. But I still can't figure how to find out what are the external drives. For instance, /Volumes shows internal drives, external drives, and mounted images. Is there a way to identify only external drives programmatically? \n\nA: Have you considered using diskutil info /dev/disk[n|s{n}] | grep Ejectable which allows you to identify whether the device (or device slice) is ejectable. \nThis would need to be expanded upon in a script using awk to work through each disk device that is currently attached to determine whether it can be ejected and then eject it.\n\nA: In a terminal window (bash shell)\ndiskutil info /Volumes/name-of-volume\nwill return a list of properties of the volume, including \nProtocol:                 FireWire\n...\n   Ejectable:                Yes\n   Whole:                    No\n   Internal:                 No\nso, I suppose you could start with that.   I'm not clear on what \nthe \"Internal\" property implies, it might be better to look at\n\"Protocol\" if your concern is with Firewire or USB external devices.\n", "Q: Change Firefox tab-switching  keyboard  shortcut To move to the next tab in most browsers, you use ctrl+⇥.\nThen, to close it, you have to reach over to ⌘+W.\nI don't like switching modifier keys like that; I'd prefer to just use ctrl for both.\nIs there a way to change the shortcuts so that both shortcuts use the control key? It would be great to switch this globally, but otherwise a solution for Firefox would be fine too.\n\nA: This is the definitive answer. Here are two official FireFox add-ons (plugins) that let you modify or define your own keyboard commands and shortcuts.\nKey config\nMy Keyboard Navigator \n\nA: This is not an exact answer to your question, but you can also use ⌘+1, ⌘+2 etc for visiting each tab, as well as ⇧+⌘+] or ⇧+⌘+[ to go to the previous/next tab.\n\nA: If you go in to System Preferences, you can then choose \"Keyboard & Mouse\" where you will be able to re-wire shortcuts. I'm writing this from my iPhone, so I can't give you detailed instructions, but googling \"mac change keyboard shortcuts\" gave me lots of guides describing how to do it, among which this one from Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2490#l4\n\nA: I belive in Firefox you can use ⌥+⌘+←/→ to view the open tabs.\n\nA: To change a keyboard shortcut that appears in an OS X application's menu:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts\nClick the plus, and type the name of the command exactly as it appears in the menu, and choose a shortcut. (e.g. \"Close Tab\" and ⌘+W)\nI would recommend, however, using the OS X standard for changing tabs, ⌘+⇧+[/], since you don't have to take your hands off home-row typing position. I believe it works for Firefox and most other tabbed applications.\n", "Q: What happens with my external drive upon using Time Machine? So I got a USB drive I want to use with Time Machine. This USB drive has some files of mine.\nIf Time Machine creates the backup in it, what happens to such files? Are they deleted?\n\nA: Two things happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine sees if the format is acceptable and makes a change to enforce enhanced security on that drive if needed.\n\n*Time Machine makes a folder named Backups.backupdb if needed and makes a folder for each machine that uses that drive.\n\n\nAssuming you don't have a Backups.backupdb folder - then everything on the drive won't be touched by Time Machine. If the drive isn't in a mac format, you may be asked to erase the drive and reformat it. Do use care and read any messages carefully before you start that first backup.\nFull details on this is at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427 - look for the section titled Changing your backup disk about a quarter of the way down for the restrictions on which format drives are supported and which need to be erased.\n\nA: While using the drive for additional purposes isn't recommended for various reasons (mostly simplicity; Time Machine's estimates of available space and corresponding expiration of backups will be off if something else is writing unrelated data to it at the same time), it can be done.  The backups are written to a particular directory (Backups.backupdb/machine, for whatever the name of the machine is), and nothing outside of that directory, including Time Machine backups from other machines and non-Time Machine files, will be touched.  (Also, if Time Machine sees something out there that is named the same as the current machine but doesn't actually appear to be related, such as a backup from a past install with the same machine name, it will retain it instead of overwriting it; or if it believes that the backup is related but isn't in its local database, it will ask you whether to preserve the existing backup or append to it.)\n", "Q: Can I use a Mid 2011 27 inch iMac (Thunderbolt) as a display for a PC? There are other questions on here that are similar, but I believe they relate to older models. If this is a dupe please close it though - I just want to find out if this can be done.\n\nI bought a 27 inch iMac (iMac12,2). The back port cluster looks like this (on the right):\n\n*from apple.com\nI wonder if I can use those Thunderbolt ports as inputs from a PC? The PC will be running a Radeon HD 4850 (i.e. it has enough juice to power the display).\nCan it be done?\n\nA: No - currently, only computers with a ThunderBolt port (combined DisplayPort + PCIe data) will work for video in mirroring on an iMac. This means a small selection of other Macs that ship with thunderbolt currently work.\nThere could be adapters later that help, and perhaps a firmware update, but even a MacBook Air that you buy today with DisplayPort out won't work with the iMacs expecting thunderbolt in.\n\nA: ATLONA is making a compatible cable.\n", "Q: How do i see the size of my trash in iPhoto '11? I'm just curious how much space I'll retrieve by deleting them.\n\nA: It's not that easy since iPhoto uses a database to track the files. When you trash the file, it simply removes the reference to that photo in whatever events and albums it used to be included.\nIt makes a reference to the original and modified files, so they don't actually get moved into a folder that you can get a quick estimate on the total trash size.\nThese pointers to a photo are so small that they are a rounding error compared even to the size of a small thumbnail of your photo.\nThe best way is to just get an estimate how large the typical picture you take is and see how much space a thousand of them take. You'll then be able to know if emptying the trash has any chance on making a difference size wise. \n", "Q: Install Ubuntu without a CD drive So here is the situation. I own a older Mac Mini (Intel core duo, 1.66 GHz) and thus will not be able to update to Lion. Also the internal CD drive failed about 3 months ago.\nNow I love my Mac. & love \"Snow Leopard \" but I have been playing around a lot with Ubuntu, running it in a virtual machine. I think that I can replace all or almost all programs that I now use on the Mac. with programs running on Ubuntu.\nSince I will not be able to buy new hardware any time soon, and this Mac Mini is now \"officially\" a low end un-supported machine.

On my Mac Os 10.5.8 Server, Java is reserving 16,777,216TB (about a third more then the sum of all human knowledge -eek!) of virtual memory. I know it's not really reserving this (it would be pretty amazing if it was!); is it something to worry about (i.e. a bug / glitch), and if not, what does it mean?\n\n\nA: 16 Mebi TebiBytes (16 ExbiBytes) is 2^64 Bytes.  Your machine must be using 64-bit addressing, and your JVM (Java Virtual Machine) probably wrote something to address 0xffffffffffffffff within its own virtual address space (possibly by accidentally writing to the address that's one less than 0x0000000000000000), causing the Mac OS X kernel's virtual memory subsystem to consider that process to be using that process's entire virtual address space.\nDon't worry, virtual memory is sparse. That is, it doesn't allocate memory pages (or swap space on disk) for every mapped address, just for the memory pages your process has actually written to. But I guess that's obvious already unless you happen to have a 16+ ExbiByte RAID mounted at / or at /var/vm/ where your virtual memory swapfiles are located. :-)\nSeeing a process cause its entire virtual 64-bit address space to become mapped is an oddity, but shouldn't cause any problems.\n", "Q: Switching between windows doesn't work in some apps (using OSX 10.6.4 if that matters)\nI know about the Cmd-`, but it doesn't work everywhere, namely Chrome and Firefox don't seem to react to it.

Select the volume on the left\n# and then File->Get Info. See \"Universal Unique Identifier\".\n#\n# Options used below:\n#  ro for readonly (can be omitted)\n#  noauto to prevent auto-mount\n#  noatime to skip writing last access times (performance thing, optional)\n#\n# Remember to set the filesystem type (hfs, ntfs, etc) too\n##########\n# BOOTCAMP\nUUID=BCC6AB78-5605-4102-B4CE-D2CF9C3D2BDB     none     ntfs     ro,noauto,noatime\nLABEL=\"SYSTEM RESERVED\" none    ntfs    ro,noauto,noatime\n\nBut, as you see, I tried to prevent 'System Reserved' from mounting as well.\nUnfortunately it doesn't work with a UUID, because it doesn't have one.\nThe LABEL option doesn't seem to work on OSX either.\n\nA: Your original solution using /etc/fstab will work, but you must use the volume's UUID (which DOES exist, Disk Utility just doesn't display it for NTFS formatted partitions- thanks Apple...)\nTo learn the UUID use the following command in terminal:\ndiskutil info /dev/diskXsY  ##substituting the X & Y for the disk and partition designation of the volume you want NOT to be mounted- which you can learn with: diskutil list\nFor this command to succeed and show you the UUID you can not have Tuxera NTFS enabled for that partition.  If you are using that or probably any other non-native file system drivers for NTFS, you must disable them (at least for that partition) and reboot.\nThe partition must also either be mounted or dismounted when you run the command- I can't remember which (and I remember that for me it actually turned out to be the opposite of what I found posted on a forum somewhere... so experiment).\nIf for some reason you just can't get OS X to show you the UUID you can resort to booting up with an Ubuntu installation disk and using a tool like gparted (there are quite a few ways using either the command line or a GUI app- you won't have trouble finding more information on that).  You don't have to worry, the UUID will be the same between operating systems.\nThen add the following line to /etc/fstab\nUUID=(you know what to put here- no enclosing brackets or anything) none ro,noauto 0 0\nreboot and voila- no unwanted partitions mounted!  This is a system wide setting for all users, but you can still mount the partition using the Disk Utility.\nThis is the most pervasive and effective solution to this problem- plus it's not broken if you happen to move the disk to another controller or port, or even if you change the volume's label.  However, formatting the partition will assign it a new UUID.\n\nA: In Mac OS Catalina 10.15.7 and above, you SHOULD NOT Edit the fstab entry directly. Instead you should use vifs with sudo. To accomplish what the original post is requesting in MacOS Catalina and above, you should take the following steps.\n\n*\n\n*Open your terminal app\n\n*Type diskutil list\n\n*Note the disk volume of your bootcamp partition, i.e. /dev/disk0s3\n\n*Next find the Volume UUID of your bootcamp partition by typing diskutil info /dev/diskXsY where X is your disk and Y is your bootcamp partition. i.e. diskutil info /dev/disk0s3\n\n*The result will return information of\nType (Bundle): ntfs and\nVolume UUID: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n*Note both of those paramaters, and copy the Volume UUID into your clipboard.\n\n*Type sudo vifs and enter your password\n\n*Once in vifs, type 'a' and hit enter.\n\n*Create a new line on the bottom of the page.\n\n*Copy and paste this EXACTLY as it is printed here replacing the UUID with your UUID that you copied in step 6:\n\n# Forbid Mounting of Bootcamp volume at boot by uncommenting the line below\nUUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX none ntfs ro,noauto\n\n\n\n*Press escape, then hold shift and type zz to save the file.\n\n\n*Bootcamp will now be properly forbidden from automounting at MacOS Boot.\n\nA: I found this forum post which has a couple options:\nThe straightforward way is to create a login applescript, replacing /Volumes/Windows with your path:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if (exists the disk \"Windows XP\") then\n        do shell script (\"hdiutil unmount /Volumes/Windows\\\\ XP -force\")\n    end if\nend tell\n\nAnother way is to modify /private/etc/rc.local to add:\ndisktool -u disk0s3\n\nIf you have more than one disk, or have formatted it into more than just a MacOS and Windows volume, you will have to use Disk Utility or something to determine the Disk Number (in this case 0) and Partition Number (in this case 3) of your Windows volume.\n", "Q: Mobile safari won't login to websites on iPad My wife's iPad 1 will no longer log into website accounts e.g. Amazon when using mobile safari, it just refreshes back to the log in page.

Simply, want have another colors when i'm working on the remote machine.\nAny idea?\nps: don't want use iTerm2, but standard Terminal.app\n\nA: I know there's already a couple of answers, but here's an alternative:\nThere's no general way to change the background color, but we can use a standard way to change the window title. If you're logging in to a lot of non-\"Unix server\" devices (such as network devices; routers, switches, firewalls etc) then you have to use their shells and cannot install your own shell variables. So, here's another way:\nfunction ssh() {\n  echo -ne '\\033[22;0t' # save title\n  H=$(echo $@ | sed -e 's/.*@//g;s/ .*//g')\n  echo $@ | grep '@' && U=$(echo $@ | sed -e 's/@.*//g;s/.* //g')\n  echo -ne \"\\033]0;${U:=$(whoami)}@${H%%.*}\\007\"\n  unset H\n  unset U\n  /usr/bin/ssh $@\n  echo -ne '\\033[23;0t' # restore title\n}\n\nAdd this to your .bashrc.\nBasically, as functions and aliases are preferred to looking in the path, this takes the ssh command and uses the text before and after the \"@\" to set HOST and USER variables which it then uses to echo an ASCII code which is recognised by the terminal and used to set the title.\nYou must use \"ssh user@host.blah\" for this and not \"ssh -l user host.blah\"\nIf you don't provide a username it will set it as your current username (obviously if you're using a custom .ssh/config (which I use a lot) then this won't be accurate, but I think it's good enough to be useful.\n\nA: I'm using the following.\nHave a shell command, called myssh, with content:\nPROFILE=\"$1\";shift;\nDEF=\"Basic\" #the default profile name\necho \"tell app \\\"Terminal\\\" to set current settings of first window to settings set \\\"${PROFILE}\\\"\"|osascript\nssh $@\necho \"tell app \\\"Terminal\\\" to set current settings of first window to settings set \\\"${DEF}\\\"\"|osascript\n\nand use bash aliases for the connect, like:\nalias ssweb='myssh Homebrew user@web.example.com'\nalias ssmail='myssh Ocean me@mail.example.com'\n\nWhen I want to ssh into the web server, I simply write ssweb in the Terminal and I got the \"Homebrew\" profile. When the ssh session ends, the AppleScript sets back to the \"Basic\".\nThe aliases should go into your $HOME/.profile or similar bash-startup file.\nThe \"Homebrew\", \"Ocean\" etc. are the setting profiles from the Terminal.app preferences. You can also set up different fonts, encodings, etc.\nOf course, you can use it directly (without aliases) like:\nmyssh Pro user@another.machine.example.com\n       ^        ^\n       |        ssh command arguments\n       terminal profile name\n\n", "Q: Intel Mac mini - maximum RAM Upgrade I have a Mac mini with a Core 2 Duo processor (2.4 Ghz). I plan to upgrade the RAM in my Mac mini. Currently, it has 2GB right now, 1GB per slot (2 slots total). I would like to buy a new 4GB for a single slot.\nThis means I would have 4GB in one slot and 1GB in the other slot. I have heard that 32-bit OSes don't support more than 4GB of RAM. Is it the same case here?\nTo find out the architecture of my Mac OS, I used this command:\nuname -p\n\nIt shows i386, it means Mac OS X is running 32-bit operating system. Will there be any problem while upgrading RAM?\nSummarizing My Question\nWhat is the maximum RAM supported in this Mac mini? (Mac mini 4,1 - new version of Mac mini) Will OS architecture be a constraint while upgrading RAM? Is this constraint applicable to my current case? How?\n\nA: For starters, OS X doesn't have the silly 64/32-bit dichotomy that Windows and Linux do. For most purposes, you can consider recent versions of OS X to be both 32- and 64-bit at the same time. The limiting factor in almost all cases of upgrading Mac RAM is the hardware chipset. \nFor your Mac mini 4,1: my copy of Mactracker says that the maximum RAM is 8GB.

I want to monitor one app on my phone to see what webservice it is accessing when it first launches.  I remember seeing an article on TUAW a while ago that detailed using Charles snooper, or something like that to set up a network to detect that.  However, I can't find it.  Anyone know where it went?  \n\nA: For a fully featured application to monitor other applications' network usage (all traffic, not just http), try Little Snitch.\nEDIT\nApologies, missed the whole key \"app on my phone\" bit. There is no way for one process to inspect or intercept data from any other app, since all apps are sandboxed. The only way to get close to accomplishing this is through a jailbreak.\nOtherwise, you would have to enable logging on your router, and the specifics on how to do this or how easy it is depends on your firewall/modem/router. Little Snitch may still be able to help you here if you have your Mac act as the wireless access point.\n\nA: Is this what you're looking for? \nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2011/02/21/how-to-inspect-ioss-http-traffic-without-spending-a-dime/\n", "Q: Using the ALT key in Windows with Parallels I need Windows for my development environment on my Mac. I use Alt-U and Alt-S a lot in this software. I can't do this on my Mac. Is there a way to send the Alt key presses to the virtual machine? \nAlt-U shows the Accessibility Utility Manager. Pressing Alt-S just types an \"s\". At work on Windows XP, neither of these behaviors happen.\n\nA: I was able to get the desired effect by holding down the ctrl+alt keys, then releasing just the ctrl key to use the alt function.\nHurrah! No editing keyboard preferences required. Hope this helps someone else too.\n\nA: For me the solution is to use the right Alt not the left Alt on the keyboard. For unknown reasons that does the trick.\n\nA: Disable the option for switching alt and cmd. The mapping should be: alt=option, cmd=windows.\n\nA: Go in to preferences on Parallels and add mappings individually for each letter combo of alt and a letter. alta maps to alta, altb maps to altb etc for all key combos that involve alt.  Time consuming but it appears to work so far.\n\nA: You should be able to use the option key - I just used it on the Windows 8 Dev Preview as well as Windows 7 using VMWare Fusion 4.

Sometimes it copies just a few of the selected files and then hangs the computer. It doesn't even eject and eventually I have to just disconnect it! \nI am very puzzled to see these problems with my iPod classic (120 GB). \n\nA: Which kind of iPod is this? iPod Touch? iPod Classic...\nApple recommends the following steps to troubleshoot iPod issues. Exactly how these steps are performed will depend upon which iPod and OS you're using:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the iPod\n\n*Retry connecting. Use a different USB port and cable.\n\n*Restart your computer. Make sure you have the latest software\nupdates installed\n\n*Reinstall the latest version of iTunes and the iPod software. Connect the iPod and select\n\"Check for Updates\" in the iPod's source page.\n\n*Restore the iPod. This erases everything and takes it back to its factory state.\n\n\nThese are the same troubleshooting steps taken at Apple retail stores. They will fix the vast majority of iPod issues. If they don't, the device has likely experienced hardware failure of some kind. If it's still under warranty you can ask Apple to replace it.\nFor advice on the above steps specific to your device you can visit Apple's iPod troubleshooting site.\n\nA: The repeated failure of large video files is also a symptom of a failing hard drive or directory corruption. You might try to erase the iPod using Disk Utility on mac or Windows Disk Manager.\nIf the drive is having issues, you might be doing nothing wrong on the iTunes end of things.\n", "Q: How do you access a subdomain on localhost with VMWare Fusion on a Mac?

This is after a regular restart and not after a crash.\nAny ideas why this keeps happening?\nI'm not sure if this happens on every restart or just regularly. I'll have to investigate more to determine that.\n\n\nA: Any file that isn't closed when the program terminates (or the mac crashes or is rebooted) gets flagged as a recovered file.\nUsually these are temporary files and never intended by the program to be seen by you.

This would be astronomically easier if she did. I also think that you're looking in the wrong place - here's what I would suggest (assuming that she's got an iPhone, and thank you to some Googling for help with the following instructions):\n\n\n*\n\n*Close iTunes.\n\n*Go to C:\\Documents and Settings\\[your name]\\Application Data\\Apple\nComputer\\SyncServices\\Local\\clientdata.\n\n*In that directory, you will find a set of directories with ridiculously long gibberishy names.\n\n*List those directories using 'Details', so you can see the modification dates on them, and make note of which of those is the most recent.\n\n*Copy the data.syncdb file that contains the contact info you want from whatever directory it's in to the most recent of the gibberish-named directories.\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*Click on Restore.\n\n*iTunes will restore your phone's data from that most-recent directory, and will pull the contacts data from whatever data.syncdb file is in that directory.\n\n\nThat said, if she doesn't have an iPhone, it'll be a lot harder to do this unless they migrated over to the Address Book or Mail or something. Do you have any iDevice lying around that you could plug in, and restore using the iPhone's original backup? That would fix that problem.\n", "Q: Application to Brainstorm in Corkboard mode I'm looking for an application similar to a mind mapping piece of software but that lets me view the notes as cards on a corkboard, being able to connect between them. The feature is shown here on Scrivener but I don't want to be using Scrivener for everything since not all of these things are writing projects. Any suggestions?\n\nA: I've not used it properly, but there's a free piece of software called MindNode on the Mac App store. It doesn't have the corkboard & card graphics that Scrivener does, but, if I understand you correctly, I think it has the required functionality.\n\nA: I like curio for brainstorming. They recently put a version on the app store for a very reasonable price. It does, however, lack a few features from the full version. \n\nA: I cannot recommend any of the desktop apps that take this skeuomorphic cork board idiom and bring it to the desktop. You've already dismissed scrivener - the obvious choice. Google has a bunch of web app suggestions you might try.\nThe free sticky notes app allows you to write and keep snippets and simply use space to organize connections. You could furthermore use spaces and one of several tools to set up a distinct corkboard background for the one space where sticky notes app lives and have a DIY app for free.\nWhether I'm working with others or alone, I end up grabbing a stack of physical cards and a pen/pencil when I'm brain storming. The mouse / trackpad / keyboard get in the way and slow me down. When I'm really brainstorming, the cognitive load of any interface other than direct touch on an iPad (or physical cards on a table) is too much delay.\nI do recommend Mental Case for Mac and OmniPlan as outstanding apps for capturing card sized chunks of data and working with interconnections once I'm over the tabletop/corkboarding phase.\n\nA: OmniGraffle can totally do that for you.

Sorry about the title. I followed these answers as suggested by some users on Ask Different. They've solved my problem.\nHowever, when I opened up Mail.app to inform it I want to use Google Notifier as default, like so,\n\nin the time it took to do this many emails downloaded to my Mac's Mail.app client.\nHow do I safely remove these emails and 'close' my Mail.app 'account' so to speak. I have no need for a local email client.\n\nA: Before following these instructions, I suggest disconnecting from the internet so that you don't download any more messages.\nOpen Mail and go to the Accounts tab in the preferences, then select your account if necessary.\n\nThe first thing you should do is ensure the account is set up as IMAP and not POP. If you used the Gmail type to set it up, you should be safe, but I believe Gmail also supports POP access. If it is set up as a POP account, you don't want to simply remove the account from Mail, or you will lose the messages you accidentally downloaded. See below for a way to get those messages back to the server.\nOnce you have made sure you won't lose your messages, you can simply press the minus button in the bottom-left corner, below the accounts list. As Calum said, this will delete messages in the Inbox, Sent, Trash and Junk folders, as well as folders which are stored on the server instead of your computer. You will have to delete the others manually.\nIf you want to make sure you don't leave anything on disk, open the HOME/Library folder in Finder. Delete the Mail and Mail Downloads folders from there. This will remove any messages and account data which Mail left behind.\n\nIf you have Gmail set up as a POP account, you can get your messages back onto the server by forwarding them to yourself. Before reconnecting to the internet, remove the password from the account information. That way, if Mail tries to check for new messages, it will have to ask for your password and you will be able to cancel it. You will still be able to send messages.\nReconnect to the internet. Find the messages you want to save and click the Forward button in the toolbar. Finally, send them to your Gmail account. They should now be on the server again, although you will need to be careful if you reply to them as it will replay to yourself instead of the person who originall\n\nA: Delete the account from the Accounts pane of the Mail.app preferences window. This will delete all settings for that account, as well as the local copies of everything in its Inbox, Sent, Trash and Junk folders (so be very sure that this is what you want to do!)\nAny emails you'd moved or copied into other local folders (i.e. into the \"On my Mac\" section of the side pane) will remain, however, so you will have to delete those separately.\n", "Q: How to keep my iTunes (app) library after reinstalling Windows?

I'm assuming the App Store keeps track of what I've purchased, but how to avoid re-downloading everything again?\n\nA: Just backup your whole iTunes Library folder. On the new OS, install iTunes, copy your Library to the old place and open iTunes holding down Shift (Windows) or ⌥ (Mac OS).\nA dialog should appear:\n\nSelect Choose Library... and select your old Library (I think you have to select the xml-file inside the Library folder) and everything should be as it has been before.\nSource: How to open an alternate iTunes Library file or create a new one\n\nA: How to avoid re-downloading everything again?\n\nYour apps by default are downloaded to the location 'C:\\Users\\username\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Mobile Applications'.

I wipe my iPad quite often since I'm an iOS developer, but what I'm wondering is that why does my CPU goes 100%?

So I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nA: \"128 kbps AAC\" - tells the system to convert audio to AAC encoded files at a quality of 128kbps so this conversion is what is taking the CPU.\nAAC is only for audio/video and nothing to do with still images\n", "Q: I keep being asked by iTunes for password and credit card verification, and getting warning emails I use iTunes (latest available build) on Windows 7 x64.\nWhenever I buy apps for my iPhone, or download free updates to apps I already purchased, iTunes asks me to enter my Apple ID password, and my credit card confirmation number; everytime this happens, I also get an email from Apple saying \"you purchased something from a device that has never been associated with your account, watch out because someone could be messing around with it\".\nI always used iTunes only on this computer, and I've tried logging out/in, and also unauthorizing the system and then authorizing it back again; but this keeps happening.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: After going through various rounds of support calls and emails with Apple, there was no way to solve the problem. However, after some months, it just disappeared.

I have installed some packages from macports, and nearly all of them required to install Xorg. How can I remove the Xorg packages? Is there a way to reinstall all my Xorg dependant package without Xorg support?\n\nA: Many ports have a +nox11 variant, which you can add as a default variant in the variants.conf file that's pointed to in your macports.conf file.  However, in my experience, there are some X11-dependent ports that don't have the +nox11 variant. I believe I've also seen situations in which non-X11-dependet port A depends on port B, and port B is so deeply X11-dependent that it wouldn't even make sense for it to have a +nox11 variant. Overall, in my experience, it's practically impossible to keep Xorg from getting installed. :-(\n\nA: There is no need to worry about xorg-* related ports. They provide the client libs for applications using X11 only. You can continue to use the X server shipped with OS X (or XQuartz).\nSee also the corresponding entry in the MacPorts FAQ.\n\nA: To disable X11 variants by default, edit /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf and add this line: -x11 +no_x11 +quartz.\nIf you install a port that requires X11 and doesn't offer a variant without, you'll have to live with it. But this will at least make it harder to accidentally install the X11 libraries when you don't want to.\n", "Q: Extend wireless network with Airport Express or Extreme? I know (or think I know) that both devices can do this. \nBasically I have the ISP provided router, which has wifi, but it doesn't work well.

I would purchase either an extreme or express, and plug it into the router, and disable wifi on the router. \nIs there a benefit to using one or the other? Can an Express have a Hard Drive attached to it for TimeMachine? Can an Extreme extend a dual band network from another extreme?\nUpdate: I already have one extreme, and very use to the software. Just wondering if it would be better to get another extreme to extend the network, or just an express. The extreme runs dual band, has a HDD connected. Its mostly in a bridge mode, the ISP router still handles DHCP, etc. Just want to disable wifi on the router, and add a second base station.\n\nA: *\n\n*TimeMachine isn't supported and doesn't like to work with drives connected to non-TimeCapsule or non-Servers. \n\n*The express USB only works for printers, not drives. (no file server included)\n\n*Turning off WiFi on the ISP router and letting Airport run either in bridge mode (letting the ISP router handle everything) is the easiest option. I prefer to have my ISP router be a bridge and let the AirPort run the network to take advantage of it's software and logging / graphing tools. Some ISP don't like that and you need them to modify their upstream device - but most just work fine.\n\n\nThe benefits I see on AirPort are having one strong signal (turning off the ISP WiFi) and less interference as well as simplicity of managing the AirPort software.\n", "Q: Can Snow Leopard Servers`s File Sharing (AFP), iCal, and iChat be updated without user logins/accounts and by individual iMacs? My supervisor wants this setup.  We have the internet service provider connected to a switch, and the switch has Snow Leopard Server and 5 iMacs connected to it.\nIs it possible to use File Sharing, iCal, and iChat without user logins/accounts from the 5 iMacs?\nI know in Workgroup Manager you can:\n1.  Create Computer Accounts\n2.  Create Computer Groups\n3.  Add Computers to Computer Groups\nIf you can do this in Workgroup Manager, can you use File Sharing (AFP), iCal, and iChat without user logins/accounts?\n\nA: Macs always have a user account - even if it's the root user or a temporary guest account that gets deleted each log out.\nYou could issue iPads and sidestep user accounts and just serve up files, calendars and chats. \n\nA: No. Computer accounts and groups are only used for preference management (e.g. if you log into this computer, you should get certain apps added to your Dock). They cannot be used to log in or access services.\n", "Q: Issues with Bootcamp trying to boot to a bootable device other than my HD A week ago, I attempting to load Windows (with Boot Camp) on my Mac Pro. The Windows 7 install CD I used had missing files, and thus I deleted the partition I created to house windows, not wanting to waste space on my hard drive. Eventually, I decided to to use bootcamp, and now, whenever I start my computer, there is a message that states: \"No bootable device, insert boot disk and press any key\", or something similar. Of course, I can hold alt/option or X at startup, but I don't want to have to do that every time I start up my computer, because normally I forget. Do you have any suggestions on how to stop this phenomena from occurring every time that I start my computer? (Note that I am looking for solutions - I understand why this is occurring)\n\nA: It seems you are booting directly to your Boot Camp partition, showing you the No bootable device, insert boot disk and press any key message (probably due to the BIOS emulation)\nTo fix this, go to System Preferences and select Startup Disk. Select the appropriate disk and restart.\n\n", "Q: How do I transfer videos I recorded on my iPhone 4 to my hard drive? My iPhone 4 is constantly low on memory when downloading large Apps from the App Store.\nI always get a message saying remove photos and videos to get space for new App.\nI have been to Apple to sort out problem but did not work. The video are very important with sensitive info. How do I move these videos to my hard drive?\n\nA: This Apple Support article details how to transfer content to your computer.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4083\n\nConnect the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer. iPhoto\n  should automatically launch into its import window with your device's\n  images and videos listed.\nSelect the images and videos you would like to import into iPhoto,\n  then select the \"Import Selected\" option.\n\n\nA: I like Image Capture and PhoneView for getting files off (and back on in PhoneView's case) the iPhone. A lot of what I snap are screen capture and I'd rather just have a folder to dump the media so I can sort and archive it as needed.\n\nA: This works just like importing photos off of your phone. When you connect via USB, iPhoto will launch and you'll be able to view and transfer your videos to iPhoto.\n\nA: iPhoto doesn't necessarily open when you connect your iPhone unless you have specifically set it to do this. \nYou didn't mention if you were using a Windows or a Mac. \nIf you do use a Mac, then image capture will do the trick. Head on into ur Applications folder and fire up image capture, and with the phone connected via usb you can see and import everything including pics and videos. \n\nA: You can either\n1. Start Preview.app and import though it\nor\n2. Start Image Capture (in Applications/Utilities) and import through that application.\n\nA: hook it up to your computer via USB.  the ipod's internal drive will show up on your desktop just like any other drive.

I'm seeking software for Mac OSX that can hide any icon on menu bar.\nSome apps leave an icon on menu bar, but don't have a option to hide its icon from menu bar, are there any applications that hide all of the icons on the menu bar? Thanks.\n\nA: There is an app called Bartender, it's paid through.\nAs far as I remember it has a full functional trial and a lot of useful functions, so you should try it.\n\nA: For every third-party status menu item (those implemented using the public NSStatusItem class) that is present in the menu bar, there is an application (possibly a background application) that must be running which is responsible for putting it there.\nAs such, there's no way to have Application B directly hide the status menu item of Application A, except to simply terminate Application A.\nI'd suggest using Activity Monitor to try to determine what application or background process is responsible for the status menu item, and then quitting that process. (Note: SystemUIServer is the name of the background process that is responsible for presenting the status menu items. It's part of the OS, so don't quit it).\nYou could also use ps auxww in a Terminal window to get a list of all processes (including the path to the executable), which might help you figure out the desired background process name depending on where it's located on disk.\nIf you're not sure, just list the names of the apps that put status menu items up there and I or someone else can figure out what process it is for you.\n\nA: There's another freemium app called Vanilla that adds a simple toggle for it.\n\n\nA: I believe that to remove unwanted menu bar items you can use the following steps: \nhttp://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/Remove_Unwanted_Menu_Bar_Icons/\n", "Q: Mail.app out of office rule I am a new mail.app user. I am going to be out of the office for a few days. I have 3 accounts in mail.app.  Can I set one out of office rule for all 3 accounts?\n\nA: Mail doesn't really do out-of-office emails, because the application would have to be running to send a response. From Mail help:\n\nMail must be running to automatically reply to messages, because rules aren’t processed while your computer is shut down or you’re logged out. To set up automatic replies while you’re on vacation, ask your email service provider how to set up an out-of-office reply.\n\nSo, as the above says, you'll have to work with your email service provider to set up an out-of-office response.\nIf you post and tell us who your email provider is, we can help you set that up.\n\nA: This is apparently do-able, as described in this article;  Mail's processing rules do permit it (at least in v4.5).  \nBut it may be awkward for the reasons Nathan pointed out, as well as the fact that most vacation responders won't auto-reply to the same sender more often than a user-selectable number of days, typically 3 (to avoid two auto-repsonders getting into a shouting match). I didn't see such an option in Mail.  Mail also \"Reply\"s to the incoming message, quoting the original plus attachments; a proper vacation responder should return only a brief notification.\nThe article references an Applescript procedure that avoid returning attachments; perhaps it's adaptable to address the other shortcomings of the rule as well.  But using your mail provider's facility (assuming they have one) sounds like a much simpler approach.\n\nA: Mail.app (as a mail client) must run to handle emails. When you leave you office and/or\n\n\n*\n\n*your notebook will turned off, or\n\n*you will be logged off (and probably, you will)\n\n\nyour Mail.app simply will not run and therefore can't handle email -> so can't auto-respond.\nAt the other side, probably, your company has his OWN imap-server or so. In this case, you should ask your local network/system admin, how to setup autoresponder (what will be independent from your Mail.app).\nIf your company uses third-party mail-server, as Nathan above pasted, you should ask your third party provider, how to setup (an Mail.app independent) auto-responder.\n", "Q: live screencasting solution that supports Power PC Macs I have a Power PC and I have been wanting to do a live screencast of a this thing I do, but there doesn't seem to be a single widget out there that would help me out.\nIt is not just a matter of grabbing the screen, I have Snapz Pro X and it will work, but I want to share it with a bunch of people in real-time.

So I'm debating between powering down and sleep mode when toting my macbook around in my backpack.  Apple says the HD 'spins down' when in sleep, which obviously means is not spinning.  But are the read/write heads completely removed from the platters as in power down or still poised at the last read/write position?\nIf they aren't cleared of the disc, I'm not dragging it around in sleep mode.\n\nA: The heads are parked out of the way. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive#Landing_zones_and_load.2Funload_technology, specifically:\n\nModern HDDs prevent power interruptions or other malfunctions from landing its heads in the data zone by either physically moving (parking) the heads to a special landing zone on the platters that is not used for data storage, or by physically locking the heads in a suspended (unloaded) position raised off the platters.\n\n\nA: In a modern hard drive, the heads are suspended above the platters by airflow. If the heads were over the data areas while the platters are not spinning, then they would touch and possibly cause damage. Therefore, hard drives must move the heads away from the data when not spinning.\n", "Q: iPhone Accessory warning - without any accessory I am getting following error:\n\nPreviously I connected iPhone headphone/handsfree.

I have restarted iPhone many many times, but anything didn't work. I am not able to talk with iPhone without handsfree. iPhone forcing me to use handsfree. \n\nA: I think the problem is caused by circuit shortening on the iPhone dock connector.

How can I uninstall it cleanly?\nI would also like to get rid of those 'duplicate' JVMs, but I need to have sources around, since I do lot of Java developement, so that may not be possible. Why are there so many of them anyway?\n\nA: After some reading:\nJVM in /System is system-wide installation of Java, which is always installed on Snow Leopard, and is updated through standard Software Update mechanism.  I don't think it would be good idea to remove this JVM, but haven't tried it ... maybe nothing bad will happen (if you don't use Java).\nMy JVMs in /Library are from Java Developer Package, which also contain sources and documentation. It seems that it is OK to simply remove them. After I have removed them, java_tool is no longer showing them.\n(After this, I've updated my Java to latest one available from Apple, and also installed latest Java Developer Package, which added new JVM into /Library again. Since I use Java sources and documentation in my IDE, I will let it live).\n\nA: Right now the System and the available Developer Java version is a the same version level, so the Developer version doesn't give you any benefits - for the moment.\nThe Developer version is used when distribution Applications with an embedded JDK, and when doing experimental development with new Java releases - and hereby the System wide version won't be touched.\n", "Q: Connecting Macbook Air 2011 to HP LP2475w monitor.. use DVI, HDMI or Display Port?

My experience with a MacBook Pro 13\" (early 2011) is:\nHDMI\nAny cable will do it, but you'll have to override the Mac OS X settings to force RGB mode. To do that follow the instructions in\nhttp://ireckon.net/2013/03/force-rgb-mode-in-mac-os-x-to-fix-the-picture-quality-of-an-external-monitor\nDVI\nNo problem, but only with Apple's official adaptor + DVI to DVI cable. In this case, image quality is perfect and I haven't got issues waking from sleep. I also tried with a 43€ mini DisplayPort to DVI 1m cable from Clicktronic and I saw random red and green pixels on dark areas of the screen. I also observed this issue with another mini DisplayPort to DVI cable from a different (cheaper) manufacturer.\nDisplayPort\nUsing CA's mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable I have extremely annoying jitters and shakes on the screen. In between those, the image quality is perfect but overall renders the usage annoying. It looks like it gets better as the monitor stays turned on for some time (about an hour). I've also observed issues when waking from sleep. Apparently the problem is not the cable, and reports of good compatibility do exist.\nhttp://estore.circuitassembly.com/products/mini-displayport-to-displayport-adapter-cable-1m.html\n\nA: The MacBook Air (2010) had problems with this monitor connecting to the displayport on the monitor. (No problems with HDMI or DVI adaptors though.) Fonts are not rendered correctly - it's as though the MBA thinks it's a VGA or something and the fonts come out sort of chunky. The Mac Mini (2010) has the same problem. The problems on the mac side - other machines I've tried with displayport worked fine. I would have reservations as to whether Apple has fixed the problem in the 2011 macs.\n\nA: Great question and great monitor.\nHere is my order of preference:\n\n\n*\n\n*DisplayPort - native to the notebook and monitor. Just get a DisplayPort to MiniDisplayPort cable and you're set.\n\n*HDMI - Preferred over DVI, because it has HDCP.\n\n*DVI - Last choice.\n\n\nThe rest options are not recommended.\n\nA: DisplayPort is the preferred way.\n", "Q: Does the iPhone multi-task while sending email? When I send a message and the progress bar is still \"moving\", can I simply move along and send another message?  \nAnd even before that is completed, if I move along and send another message can I be guaranteed that all messages will be sent?\n\nA: Yes you can. You can even close the Messaging app.\n\nA: Apple's own applications have the capability to do \"real\" background processing and multitasking. User created applications have \"some\" capability (and limited time) to perform \"certain\" background processing and multitasking. \nWith that said, most apps that need to finish a task, can do so because Apple has provided a way to do such things. \n", "Q: Split bootable ISO I am a user of Windows and I want to use MAC OS X.

Thus when I connect, it takes me to the \"Set Up Your iPhone\" screen and insists that I either \"Set up as a new iPhone\" or \"Restore from a backup\", despite the fact that neither is it a new device nor do I wish to restore from any backup and the thing I want to do is just \"do nothing\" and carry on as before...\nAm I the only person in the universe to have this problem, and if not, is there a way to fix it?\n\nA: Completely restore the iPhone using DFU mode.\nSee the instructions posted on this website and then do a complete restore of your iPhone and set it up as new.\nIf the problem persists, it might be that your iTunes would need to be reinstalled. Don't forget to unlink your library to your computer before uninstalling iTunes and keep a copy of your data.\nConsolidate your library PRIOR to backing it up, removing iTunes, etc., etc.\n", "Q: What can I do to speed up a Mac that is running slow? My mac seems like it is running slower and slower. While I am thinking abut installing Lion from scratch, I figure there has to be stuff I can do now to help. I have reset PR RAM recently, I have run the verify disk utility, and fixed permissions. I have seen mixed references to running a disk defragmenter. Could that help? I am on an iMac that is about 2 years old now.\nI regularly run Windows XP in Parallels, Chrome, Mail.app, and iTunes.\nUpdate: I have about 90 GB of free space. I run Onyx every month. \n\nA: First, check that your processor is running full speed. Go to Preferences, Energy Saver, Options and look at the drop box down near the bottom called Processor Performance. If it is not set to \"Highest\", set it to that right away. This maximizes performance, but for notebooks, it may run down the battery faster. Note that not all Macs have this setting - laptops do, and my certainly my PowerMac G5 tower does, but not all Macs do.\nNext, download OnyX and run the complete set of clean up and maintenance scripts and then evaluate again. Get OnyX at:\nhttp://www.titanium.free.fr/pgs/english.html\nNext, you may wish to check that you have enough free space on your hard drive. Highlight the Macintosh HD icon on your desktop, CTL-click it and select Get Info from the resulting menu. Make sure you have a reasonable amount of space left. If not, a little spring cleaning may be in order. \nThere are two excellent apps for showing where all of your hard disk space has gone, Disk Inventory X and WhatSize. Get them at:\nDisk Inventory X: http://www.derlien.com\nWhatSize: http://www.id-design.com/software/whatsize\nBoth do a great job at letting you zero in on your largest disk space consumers, so that you can hunt down any rogue files (and both are freeware, which is good).\nFinally, it is possible you may have some processes running that are consuming a lot of idle CPU, thus slowing down your machine overall. I had a bad widget that did this once. Open Activity Monitor and look at your \"resting\" CPU occupancy when you are not doing anything in particular with the machine. It should be pretty much zero (maybe 1% to 2% at most). If it not, identify the process or processes that are taking the time. What are they? Do you recognize them? Are they needed?\nIf you find one that is not needed, kill it and see how your machine starts to behave. If this is the cure, you will need to identify the startup item that launches it and delete it.\nSo, in summary then, take the following steps in order:\n1/ Start with ensuring that your processor speed setting is full (applies to many Macs but not all)\n2/ Then do Onyx based full maintenance\n3/ Then check that you have sufficient available disk space \n4/ Finally, search for processes that are consuming an unexpected amount of CPU\nSource: http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-operating-system/80467-how-do-i-get-my-mac-run-faster.html\nAnother place you may find helpful: \nhttp://lowendmac.com/eubanks/07/0312.html\n\nA: Regarding installing Lion from scratch, that is not actually possible, you have to have Snow Leopard installed to be able to install Lion.\nEDIT: You can install Lion from scratch.  When you download Lion, do not install it, instead, open the package contents, select Install ESD and from there you can burn the file as an ISO disk image.  Putting this disc into the mac, rebooting while holding down the 'c' key, will boot the disc and you can format the hdd and reinstall as a clean OS.\nHave you already got the maximum amount of ram your computer can handle installed? -If not I would suggest that as the first step to improving performance, especially if you're running two operating systems at once.\n\nA: To rule in or out the need for more ram, open Activity Monitor at the end of the day and check system memory > page outs.  This will show you how much data was paged out to your hard drive when ram was not available to handle it.\nOn my MBP with 8 Gb, I show 5.29 Gb Page ins (handled by ram) and 0 Bytes of page outs.  I used to have 1 - 2 Gb of page outs before I upgraded to 8 Gb of ram.\nI'm also running XP via Parallels.\n\nA: I tried for months to analyze what was wrong with my MacBook and eventually found it went away after uninstalling Hardware Growler.

However, after copying it to the Applications folder, it says it can't run on this version of OS X (I have checked in About this Mac, and the version matches what's on the CD cover).\nI right clicked the app, Show Package Contents and opened its info.plist; there it said the minimum version supported is 10.5, so I changed this to 10.4.11, saved the file and tried opening the app, but it still wouldn't open. The message box looks like it's from the OS rather than the application, so the app hasn't even started before I get told I can't open it. \nIs there a way to trick it into allowing it to open, and hopefully nothing will go wrong, seeing as according to the box it can run on my Mac.\n\nA: NSBundle and CFBundle aggressively cache the contents of application bundles to improve performance. Although you edited the Info.plist, the Finder and Launch Services don't yet know that the application is any different.\nRunning the following command in Terminal to touch the application bundle will force the Finder (and Launch Services) to re-register the application, thereby noticing the changes you made to the Info.plist:\ntouch \"/Applications/My Cool App.app\"\n\nAfter running that, deselect the application, then reselect it in the Finder, and then try launching it.\nNote that this won't necessarily guarantee that you'll be able to launch the app. The developer would need to make sure they set a deployment target of 10.4 and/or use weak framework linking to assure that the app will be fully backward-compatible.\n\nA: For me it was enough to edit the .plist file of a game, and the app would at least open. Then unfortunately it said that I could not run Metal with my actual graphic card....\nBut still, it's so satisfying when you kinda trick the system :)\n", "Q: accidentally set my main folder as shared in public place I just figured my main folder under my user and everything in it was shared. Is there a log on my computer that checks whether someone downloaded from my computer? I remember there was somebody else with a mac on the same network and had the opportunity to download all my private information.\nThanks \n\nA: I don't think that there is a method to do that. Anyhow, I bet that the chances of that happening are very small. First, the person would have to have no morals, and second, the person would have had to specifically look for a shared folder, and that is also relatively unlikely. Also, just to be safe, monitor what can be monitored to discover whether your information was taken for a few days/weeks.\n", "Q: How can I release and renew my DHCP lease from Terminal? From the Terminal, how can I release and renew my DHCP lease?\nCurrently, I'm doing the following for the wireless interface, but I'm wondering if there's a better way:\nsudo ifconfig en1 down\nsudo ifconfig en1 up\n\nFor the wired interface, replace en1 with en0.\n\nA: This can also be achieved with the following two commands :\nsudo ipconfig set en0 BOOTP\nsudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP\n\nYou can alias the two together in your bash profile:\nalias renew=\"sudo ipconfig set en0 BOOTP && sudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP\"\n\nSo then you just have one command called renew that will release and renew your DHCP.\n\nA: The way the renew button works in System Preferences is to create a key in the system configuration.

Now a new second generation is due for release.\nAdd a keyboard and mouse to restore ergonomic sanity to your work-life.\nNotice how the hot bottom of your MacBook becomes exposed at an angle.\n\nStep # 2 – Fan\nBuy this seemingly high-quality little 4-inch fan from BestBuy.com. Only USD $ 6 on sale, ten bucks regular price. Your choice of white, blue, or “sorbet” pink.\nPosition the fan to the rear, behind your Roost. Angle upwards, aiming at the bottom of your MacBook. Turn on the quiet steady stream of cooling air.\n\n\n\nSee my blog post for details.\n\nA: Cooling plate\nEnergy efficient but noisy cooling plates use a compressor, like your fridge/freezer at home, a.k.a. compressor deck or mechanical cooling unit. Bonus is their energy efficiency, f.e. eta=70~286% for a Danfoss BD35K direct current compressor (COP=0.70~2.86). These units are for example sold as to-be build-in units in the maritime and ready-to-use in the food&beverage and funeral industry. Downside, beside the noise, is the highest setting for the thermostat is often +2ºC. Such low temperatures are below dew point, resulting in condensation. An example of a compressor based cooling plate is produced by Indel Webasto. Be inspired by the pen-sized Embraco Micro Compressor press release, retired in 2014 according to archive.org.\nAlternatively a Peltier element a.k.a. thermo electric cooling a.k.a. TEC, allows you to build your silent, about 20~450% efficient (COP=0.2~4.5), cooling plate. Feeding electrical current results in one side of the plate gets up to 70ºC below its hot side. To not damage the element by overheating the heat does need to be transferred away using a medium, like air or water. Using air requires a heat sink and a fan, which are produced for example by Fischer Elektronik as LAM (miniature 30mm wide) and LA hollow fin fan units (62mm wide). To optimize energy efficiency, run TEC's at lower current then their maximum rated value: f.e. running at 2.5 instead of 6 amps results in an efficiency increase from COP 0.4 to 2.6. The temperature difference between hot and cold side, thus cooling capacity will be lower, needing more TEC elements.\nTo verify that a cooled down bottom side of the MacBook body would lower the internal battery temperature, I did 2 experimental test runs with a 200 ml ice pack (my guess: equivalent to ±5 watt hours of cooling capacity) on a MacBook Air 11 inch running with the lid closed. One time I could cool the internal battery down 7ºC (from 34.5ºC to 27.6ºC) and 6ºC (from 32.4ºC to 26.5ºC) at 26~28ºC ambient.\n\n\nA: I tend to remain sceptical of anyone making claims without valid and reliable data. With that said, some practices you list are of critical importance; others, I'm not sold on one bit. Please don't take this a slight against you, but rather as a criticism of your general claims (and lack of scientific data therein). Moreover, if you enacted all those changes at once, you'll never know which one made a real difference, and which one did absolutely nothing. Proper scientific methodology calls for the manipulation of one variable against a control (unless you want to run the more complex ANOVA).\n\nClean your MacBook Pro fans from within... it's simple, open the\n  bottom closure and blow the hell out of these fans\n\nAbsolutely. This is by far the most effective way to ensure your system continues to operate nominally over the years. It is sadly also the most neglected. Dust sticks to the blades (and most of the internals) creating a \"sticky\" residue and not only prevents the fan's blades from spinning at their optimum, but seriously restricts air flow. Computers generally accumulate far more dust than people expect. Regular cleanings are essential!\n\nDownload and install Fan Control and run your fans @ 2800-3000 RPM\n\nThis of courses comes at a sacrifice to noise (increasing it) and I'd like to see data on how much cooler the chips operate with such a small increase to RPM.\n\nDitch all browsers to Safari, I tried them all Firefox up to version 5\n  and 7 (Aurora), Chrome and Opera... nothing beats the CPU usage (less\n  of it) than Safari. Also flash youtube videos run with less resources\n  on Safari for some reason\n\nAgain, I'd like to see some data being this claim. These guys have conducted some very loose tests that support your assertion, and I'm inclined to agree that Safari, being so tightly integrated into OS X should net improvements over its competitors across the board, but a few CPU cycles here and there aren't going to amount to a drop (drastic or modest) in temperatures (these saw extremely small differences in performance).\n\nUse your faster GPU on AC Power, and lower on Battery power (use\n  http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus for source-based GPU switching)\n\nGPUs put off heat, wether they're integrated or discrete. I can see a reduction in power, but a reduction in heat, again, I'm not sold. In the case of MBP, models that possess discrete video cards have dual fans (one for the CPU and one for the GPU). So using the discrete card may kick off additional heat, but it's also got a dedicated fan to push that heat away from the machine. Stressing the integrated chip will see the CPU spike in temperatures, which means that fan will be doing more work to handle the additional load. It may be the case that the fan on the CPU (together with the integrated GPU) may be sufficient in pulling away the excess heat, but at no doubt the cost of excessive noise (generated by 6,000 RPMs). I don't know if anyone has done testing, but from my own anecdotal experience with my old MBP1,1, the GPU fans rarely switched gears (unless playing intensive games and then the issue would be moot as you'd want to use the discrete video). It was always the CPUs fans that took the brunt of the work.\n\nReplace your internal hard drive with an SSD\n\nNot only will this greatly improve performance, but it can't hurt in reducing temperatures. The idle/active power consumption of an SSD is about 0.5W to 2w, respectively. The average power consumption of a traditional HDD is about double that (1W to 2.5W, respectively). I won't know what that transfers to in the temperatures department, but it certainly can't hurt.\n\nKeep your monitor running @ 90% brightness and keep your keyboard lights off or low\n\nI'd love to see data on this. LED backlighting is already quite efficient and distributing heat, but I'm not sure a reduction (at least that small) in power would have any effect. As for the keyboard lights, those are LEDs and as is with such small LED bulbs, they are incredibly power efficient and produce little to no heat as a result.\nWith all that said, I'd saying re-application of Arctic Silver 5 (or thermal compound of equal quality) and the cleaning of dust from the internals is the most effective (and proven) way to keep your system cool. I've never seen data to convince me that turning off some service, or placing your system on a pad with a couple of fans does anything (other than perhaps keep the case cooler to the touch) worth merit.\n\nA: Uninstall flash - http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome\nChrome isn't bad for sites you need to view flash - and it's easier to quit that app to reclaim your CPU cycles from that plug in. I get hours of real life battery use with this one tip.\n\nA: If you have a login account to YouTube, you can configure your account to play back most videos with HTML5 rather than Flash. It's called the HTML5 Beta program. Do a search for it at youtube.com.\n\nA: I rather like ClickToFlash/ClickToPlugin for keeping Safari's CPU usage under control. Keeping flash from loading (except for the 1% of the time when I want it) really helps to keep the fans down.\n\nA: I agree that the monitor running @90% brightness doesn't help at all. \n\n\n*\n\n*The SSD did however impact my overall system temperature and how the touch feels.\n\n*My fans are set to 3500 RPM and i never hear them, so that never bothered me.\n\n*I also noticed that switching through Mission Control peaks the CPU (for obvious reasons).\n\n*Browsers change, i'm back on Firefox 7 now, it's highly well optimized, CPU cycles are minimal\n\n*Lion's 10.7.0 & 10.7.1 coreaudiod runs at 8~10% CPU when playing music/iTunes making the CPU in heat\n\n\nHere's an overall temp of my system: http://cl.ly/3R2S3x1a1f1A3h0q2009\n", "Q: Ping command on iPad Is there some way by which a ping command or somewhat similar can be run on iPad ?\nI am trying to do this as my wifi connection dies out if there is idle time even for a few mins though it works with continuous ping on desktop browsers.\nSo i want to simulate the same ping thing on iPad..\n\nA: Ouch - do realize that you will be working against two factors.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the ping app is in the foreground - it's a easy project.\n\n*For it to run in the background (where it will do you any good) it has to play by the background task API - all of which are designed to prevent the usage of the CPU and preventing the WiFi from dropping. Even if it worked a while, it would be a bug and likely to break every time Apple updates it's OS.\n\n\nYour battery life will be horrible - but that's your call since your network interruption might be more pain than a ten hour runtime. I have a solution that will work out of the box.\nGet yourself a mapping app like Runmeter. It can be configured to upload a map to the internet every 5 minutes. It can also monitor a twitter stream, so you could set up a bot account to push updates more rapidly if the mapping alone didn't keep your iPad from detecting the WiFi as idle.\n\nA: I just tried Network Ping Lite which worked well:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/network-ping-lite/id289967115?mt=8\n", "Q: TextMate not saving files in UTF-8 I set my prefs to save files in UTF-8 (the default). But I've noticed that my files are not UTF-8 but US-ASCII.\nWith my newly created file:\nfile -I myfile\n\n=> myfile: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nWhat gives?\n\nA: I'm not an expert in the field, but I believe the reason for this is you probably saved your test file only with ASCII characters. When using only ASCII characters UTF-8 is simply indistinguishable from it. It's when you start using characters that are outside ASCII scope (e.g. accents in other languages, like ąśćż in polish) the difference is noticable.\nTry copy&paste the characters I used as an example, save your file again and test it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use a serial terminal (e.g. VT420) with a modern Mac? I've found lots of tutorials for using a Mac to control a serial device, but not the other way around.  I've got a DEC VT520 terminal and a recent Mac Pro, is there a way (with a USB adapter) to get a shell on my Mac from a hardware serial console?  Basically I'm looking for an OS X version of the \"Ubuntu Serial Console HowTo\".  Or is this so ridiculous that no one has tried it?\n\nA: I have not tried this, personally, but there are good instructions for doing so with a Tripp Lite (née Keyspan) USB-to-Serial adapter and an Apple IIc. Obviously, you can ignore the Apple II-specific parts of the instructions (the majority of the article) and focus on the adapter, the cable, and getting ttys to run getty.\n\nA: I've had quite a fondness for the SitePlayer Telnet module for some time, as and it really complements the OS X environment as well. It costs a bit more than a simple DB-9 or DB-9 -> USB cable does, but it offers a great advantage.\nYou simply set up the module with network information you will use to access it, and the serial parameters for it's serial connection. Then, connect to it via it's defined network information, and you have yourself a serial connection to the server it's plugged into.\nEven cooler? The module announces itself via Bonjour so you know if it's \"alive\" and what it's connection information is.\nIt's really a great alternative to having to pull copper for Networking, and cabling additionally for serial management/connectivity.\n\nA: I use ZTerm along with a Keyspan adapter to provide serial console support on my MacBook Pro. \nhttp://homepage.mac.com/dalverson/zterm/\n", "Q: Jailbreak my work phone I just got an iPhone from my company.

I was recently using someone else's iMac and came across some rather strange behaviour.  Searches (from google and yahoo at least, I didn't test other search engines) were being redirected.  After searching, then clicking on a link in the search led to a new window being opened with some redirected link in it (the redirection went through a few variations before settling on the final link).  Going back to the original window and clicking on the link a second time led to the correct site.  This happened with both Safari and Firefox (I didn't test other browsers).\nSearching on the internet suggested that this was a piece of malicious code, but I couldn't find it in the process lists.  The key symptoms were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turning off javascript removed the problem.\n\n*Creating a whole new account removed the problem (for the new account).\n\n*Booting in safe mode did not remove the problem.\n\n*There was no obvious process that the original account (with the problem) was running that wasn't being run by the new account (without the problem).\n\n\nSo guessing that there was some malicious javascript somehow cached on the machine, I tried deleting everything that looked cache-like (in particular, in ~/Library/Cache - if I remember right).  That seemed to fix it, but the owner told me that the next day it was back again.  I couldn't find a \"get rid of all temporary files, no I really mean all temporary files\" command.\nMy real question is: can someone identify the problem and tell me what steps to tell the machine's owner to do to get rid of it?\n(Note that I'm no longer in front of that machine, unfortunately, so further diagnostic tests will be tricky; add in to the mix the fact that the owner is not a computer ... nerd.)\nPerhaps a more answerable question (if the above isn't answerable) is: what steps are needed to clean out temporary files from a user's area on an apple?  I'd prefer concrete steps rather than \"download (and pay for) iKillTempFiles\".\nLastly, I don't know the versions of the software involved, but I suspect they were all fairly old.\n\nA: Sounds like a DNS changer of sorts.\ncould maybe try running a scan with clamXav if your not too familiar with what files are legit and what ones are malicious.\nwhere I found the dodgy DNSchanger file and instal.pkg\n~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins\n/Library/Receipts\nOnly clearing the cached files wont get rid of malware.

Use the empty cache menu item, then quit and restart the browser.\n\nA: Some free web sites use Javascript redirecting to get you to read their ads.  Without that, people just skipped the ads, meaning these sites produced no income!\n\nA: Did you ceck to see if the user is revisiting a site that is reinfecting the computer after you clear the cache? I suggest that as you said clearing the cache fixed it temporarily. \n\nA: Some things I would try to solve the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean temporary files with an app like CCleaner (free) or CleanMyMac.\n\n*Run a Mac antivirus program.  Lifehacker has a nice roundup of them here.\n\n*If the previous steps fail, take the safe route, backup your data, format your drive, and reinstall OS X from scratch (Lion guide from Apple, Snow Leopard guide from Apple).\n\n\nSome other notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I agree with the other answers, sounds like a DNS change.  Try the DNS settings suggested by Miro.\n\n*Safari and Firefox use different cache files, so it is unlikely that it is the issue.\n\n", "Q: Has anyone had success uploading a video or photo to Google Plus from iOS?

Running Windows 7 and after a resume the fan comes on about 2 minutes and doesn't turn off and it's the loudest thing in the room. I'm not doing anything but browsing . . and I don't think it's because of flash. Any ideas?\n\nA: Windows (in Boot Camp) doesn't do most of the power management tricks OS X does, so the CPU generally runs at full tilt all the time. That creates lots of heat, so your fans stay on. It may be because of flash, but, like you, I doubt it. To test that, leave Windows running for awhile with no web browsing.\n", "Q: Can TextEdit save as plain text? When I try to save a new file in TextEdit, I always get a popup saying I can't save with \".txt\" at the end of the file name.\nI want to save a plaintext file, but TextEdit insists on saving as .rtf instead. It also lists .doc, .odt, .html, and some others.\nHow can I save a TextEdit document as plain text?\n\nA: The format menu has a toggle to switch things for you.\nPressing shift + command + T will toggle the document to plain text mode.\n\nYou can also set the default format in the preference pane for the app.\n\n", "Q: Can I disable the Lion animation when switching to/from fullscreen apps? In Lion there is an animation when switching to and from full screen applications. Full screen apps are great, especially on a 11\" screen, but this animation is getting very annoying.

I don't want to look at the spam crap twice :-)\nUPDATE: I want to do this because I have some very old mails in my trash I don't want to delete at the moment (or decide what to do with). So I cannot delete my whole trash. But to avoid the trash becoming bigger and bigger I want to delete spam etc. without moving to trash...\n\nA: Why look in the trash at all? Just set your Trash to automatically delete messages after a day. You can do that in the Accounts pane of preferences:\n\n\nA: You can delete emails and bypass the trash using\n⌥ Option + ⌫ Backspace\n(Successfully tested with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). Could work with older versions, too.)\n\nIf you want to delete emails that are already in trash it is enough to hit ⌫ Backspace to delete them permanently. If you are accustomed to also press the ⌘ Command, like deleting a file in Finder, you can do so. But basically, backspace is enough.\n\nA: All you have to do is any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*hold down the Option key, while clicking on the trash can on the top toolbar\n\n*hold down the Option key, while clicking on 'delete' on the top menubar\n\n*hold down the Option key, while right-clicking on the desired emails and scroll down to select 'delete'\n\n*hold down the Option key, while pressing the Delete key on your keyboard.\n\n\nA: Delete the message: ⌘⌫\nThen empty the trash: ⇧⌘⌫\n\nA: A very old tip (2006) from MacWorld suggests using ⌘ Command+X to cut the messages and then just copying some text to wipe the clipboard. This seems to work, but Mail.app tries to copy the contents of those emails to memory - so probably not very useful for lots of mails with attachments.\n", "Q: iTunes sync podcasts Is there a way to sync iTunes podcast subscriptions across two iTunes installations; one on a Mac and the other on a W7 ?\n\nA: You can copy the list of subscriptions between them, but I don’t know how to keep them in sync.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the sidebar of the first iTunes installation, select Podcasts, right click, then click Export. I use the OPML file type, but others might work. (Let’s call it Podcasts.opml).\n\n*Using a USB stick, Dropbox, or some other method, transfer Podcasts.opml to the computer with the second iTunes installation.\n\n*Select File > Add to Library, and find Podcasts.opml. Once you open it, your second iTunes installation will have the same podcast subscriptions as the first.\nTwo comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*This won’t keep them in sync; if your podcast subscriptions change, you’ll need to repeat the above to carry the changes across.\n\n*There may well be a much easier method, using something like Home Sharing or Dropbox, to keep the single library file synced between the two machines.\n\n", "Q: Remote Desktop Connection for Mac not being able to connect?

Try using a clipboard saver to paste faster than you could type and still seem professional.\n", "Q: Sparrow over a SSH-tunnel Is it possible to use Sparrow over a SSH-tunnel since the imap and ssl ports are blocked at my work?\n\nA: I think your basic strategy is correct, e.g.:\nssh -L 587:smtp.gmail.com:587 -L 993:imap.gmail.com:993 user@yourremotehost\nshould get you talking to Gmail via yourremote host.  Potential problems are if you do not run this as root (with sudo), you are not allowed to specify local ports below 1024 - so you can't use 587 or 993 as your local ports.  So, do something like this:\nssh -L 9587:smtp.gmail.com:587 -L 9993:imap.gmail.com:993 user@yourremotehost\n...and configure Sparrow to talk to localhost on those high local port numbers instead of the defaults.\nAgain, you can debug by trying 'telnet localhost 9587' which should get you an SMTP prompt from Gmail.  If that works, you should feel confident that the SSH part is working, and concentrate on Sparrow configuration.\nIf you get it all working, an alternative to the commandline switches is to make a file called 'config' in your local .ssh directory that looks like this:\nHost yourremotehost    \n        LocalForward    9587    smtp.gmail.com:587\n        LocalForward    9993    imap.gmail.com:993\n\n", "Q: iPhone \"software\" vs. \"hardware\" keyboard layout?

That's the hardware keyboard for which you'd be specifying the layout.\n", "Q: How will the OSX Lion upgrade affect my Win 7 bootcamp setup? And what are things to watch out for based on previous upgrades?\n\nA: No, the Lion upgrade will only affect the partitioned part of your hard drive housing Mac OS. \nEdit:\nIt will also install a small partition housing, basically, the installer of Mac OS. This is so that if your installation ever fails or something like that you can always reinstall. \n", "Q: iPad doesn't ask for home sharing password I have set up homes sharing on both my iPad and macbook's iTunes. Originally I did not set a password and it worked. Now I have set a password in iTunes preferences and when accessing my shared library on the iPad the content from library is displayed without me having to enter the password. \nI have tried removing my apple ID from the settings app and restarting iTunes as well as the iPod and video apps on my iPad. Still I can access my content without entering a password. \nSo why am I able to access my content without the password and how do I fix it, so that the password is required?\n\nA: If you don't want to just turn off Home Sharing on your computer, then two things come to mind. \nIf you changed the Apple ID somewhere else than the iPod settings - then that would explain things. (I've accidentally cleared the store account when I meant to change this upon going to a friend's house)\n\nI just tested on my iPad and deleting the home share as depicted above immediately disconnected from my Home Share - I didn't need to kill iTunes on the iPad or do any re-starting - the effect was immediate as soon as I exited the settings tab. \nAssuming you got the place correct, then your iPad iTunes database is a little corrupt. Sometimes syncing the iPad with a different iTunes library (music only) will delete your music and settings and allow things to work again. It's not easy to poke in the files directly on the iPad - and you may have to restore the device and set it up as new if getting a new set of iTunes data doesn't resolve it.\nLastly - you could check troubleshooting steps with Apple - the express lane at the bottom is good if the steps listed don't resolve it for you. It's highly unlikely to be something on your account with them or the computer, but they will know the oddball causes if the obvious next steps don't work.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 13\" Audio In/Out Port Adaptor I have the most recent Macbook Pro 13\" and on the apple website it says that the audio port is in and out. I just ordered a headset that has two separate 3.5mm plugs and was wondering if there is any sort of adapter that would let me use both the headphone and the mic, or if it has to be one or the other, since there is only one port.\n\nA: Any headphone / microphone combination that works with an iPhone will work with the MacBook line as the pin connectors are the same.\nAs a bonus, the play and volume switches get passed to the OS as well.\nThere are tons of adapters around if you preferred headset doesn't have the correct mic pins to combine the signals in one plug.\nAlso - look here for the ground that's already been covered.\n", "Q: How to undo SetFile -a V?

Just type the attribute V lowercase and restart the Finder!:) \n", "Q: How can I force command-line arguments to a program shortcut in the dock? I have Chrome installed in Applications, and a shortcut to it in the Dock.\nHow can I achieve to force some command-line arguments to each start-up of this app?\nLet me be clearer, in the Terminal, I can do this:\nopen /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app --args --explicitly-allowed-ports=6666\nAnd that way I modify Chrome's behavior as I like it.\nHow can I have this option by default when launching the app from the Finder of the Dock?\n\nA: If you go inside the app bundle (right-click on the app in Finder and select \"View Package Contents\") and go to the Contents/MacOS folder, there should be a file called Google Chrome whose icon is a black square. Make a note of its name and rename it (something easy like Google Chrome orig). Make a blank text file in the folder with the same name (Google Chrome) as the original file and paste in the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/Applications/\"Google Chrome.app\"/Contents/MacOS/\"Google Chrome orig\" --args --explicitly-allowed-ports=6666\n\nMake your script file executable (chmod +x \"Google Chrome orig\") and see if that starts Chrome properly!\n\nA: According to Mac OS X Hints article (found by Googling mac gui application command options), this can be accomplished by editing the application's bundle. I would do this on a backup copy of Chrome to test it out first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Google Chrome application bundle by right/ctrl-clicking on it and selecting Show Package Contents.\n\n*Within the package, navigate to Contents/Mac OS/Google Chrome and rename it something like Google Chrome-bin.\n\n*Create a text file at that same location with the name Google Chrome with the following contents:\n!/bin/sh\n\nexec '/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome-bin' --args --explicitly-allowed-ports=6666\"\n\n\n*Use terminal to change the new file to be executable (chmod 755).\nNote, I've not actually tried this, only outlining what's mentioned in the linked article.\n\nA: One way to do this is with AppleScript.\nOpen AppleScript Editor (/Applications/Utilities) and type this in:\ndo shell script \"open '/Applications/Google Chrome.app'  --args --explicitly-allowed-ports=6666\"\n\nSave it as an Application, and add that application to the Dock.\nClick on the app's icon and you Chrome will open with your custom parameters.\nThis way works, but it isn't exactly ideal for a couple reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running the AppleScript will take a little longer than just opening the app\n\n*You'll have two icons in your dock (the script and Chrome)\n\n\nThis will work, but I'm interested to see if someone comes up with a better answer.\n", "Q: OSX: Affix window to not move on spaces switch Is there an option, or external program that anyone knows of that would allow me to set window to always stay in the same position on every one of my 4 spaces / not move when I switch. \nLike I want VLC player to not move so I watch a movie, but switch spaces between other applications.\n\nA: Open System Preferences > Exposé & Spaces, click the \"+\" under the listbox of Application Space assignments, select your application (which must be running), then click in the Space column for the newly-added application entry where it says \"Space 1\"; \"Every Space\" appears at the top of the dropdown list.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro unable to use the internet while connected to IPSec VPN Short Question\nIs there something I am missing when setting up a Cisco IPSec VPN connection that redirects all traffic over the VPN?  \nBackground\nWhen I am connected to the VPN, I can browse our company's intranet with no problems, but when I try to go out to say www.google.com it times out.

I don't know what kind of router you are connecting to,b ut an example is shown here.  Basically whomever is running the router would need to configure it to allow this behavior.\n\nA: I'm running an ipsec endpoint with pfsense 2.0-rc2. Using the native vpn client with Mac OS 10.6 and now 10.7, internet and local lan access works fine. However all traffic travels over the tunnel so I had to add an any-any rule for ipsec traffic in the pfsense firewall settings. Hope that helps.\n\nA: We were able to resolve this issue by running Shrewsoft's 2.2 Beta release that supports Mac OS X.  The install directions are here.  So far this seems to be working like a champ.  It also allows a single configuration for both Windows and Mac users regarding the VPN configuration.\nThanks for all of the great trouble shooting tips!\n", "Q: Spotify output to AirPlay speakers on iPad I don't see the AirPlay speaker selection gadget on the Spotify IOS client.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is AirPlay support something the App developer must provide explicitly?\n\n*Is there a way to force the default audio output from an IOS device to an AirPlay speaker at the system level?\n\n\nA: D'oh! The AirPlay icon is available in the Spotify client. It is on the Info page rather than the top page.  That's where volume control is, too.\n", "Q: How to downgrade an iOS app for iPod touch? Is it possible to downgrade an app from a newer version to an older version without having a copy of the older verion.\nI guess this could also be rephrased to, 'is it possible to download an older version of an app from the AppStore after the new version has been released'\n\nA: If you have Time machine enabled or you don't empty your trash very often you're in luck. You can go into Time machine and simply roll back to an older version of the app in Finder. Then if you uninstall and reinstall the app from iTunes you'll get the older version. Apps are stored by default in /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications if I'm not mistaken. Just find the older version in your trash or hit Time machine once you get to that directory and roll right on back.\n\nA: In a word? Nope.\nThe app store provides a couple of facilities for getting applications, but all of them are for the most recent versions. There's a chance that you may be able to use un-delete software on your iTunes App directory and recover it, if the data space has not already been overwritten. Otherwise, you must preserve IPA's that iTunes throws into the Trash, else they're pretty much gone forever.\nAdditionally, to the best of my knowledge, IPA binaries are unique on a downloaded system, for DRM purposes, so I believe you cannot simply obtain an archived version from a friend, and send it back into iTunes.\n", "Q: Can I prevent SMS from showing on the Lock Screen in iOS 4? I have some private SMS messages I want to hide. The problem is that they are displaying on main screen even when it's locked. So it was useless using password because it's displayed even with the lock.\nHow can I make SMS messages hidden on locked screen?\n\nA: As of the latest OS (5.0 and 5.1), you use the following method:\nTo turn off Message preview:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Settings app.\n\n*Navigate to Notifications > Messages.\n\n*Scroll down to Show Preview and set it to Off.\n\n\nNow, instead of showing the actual message on the lock screen and in notifications, it will only tell you that you received a message and by whom you received it.\n\nA: Go to Settings > Messages. There's an option \"Show Preview\" there. If you toggle this to off, it will stop showing SMS previews on the lock screen. This will also disable the alert popup when a new SMS arrives and the phone is not locked.\n\nA: Go into settings->notifications->messages and turn off the badges option.\n\nA: If you're jailbroken, iBlacklist is an excellent app. You can block SMS and calls from your phone completely. The app intercepts them, and can save the logs. It is password-protected, so there's an extra layer of security as well. \nEven if you don't want to blacklist anyone, you can still set it so that you don't get a popup at all when new SMS messages arrive. Your messages will go to your regular inbox, and you'll still hear the alert, but no popup. \nFree trial, costs $12 to buy. \nI have also heard about MCleaner. Never used that one though. \n", "Q: Boot Camp Additional Software Offline? I'm trying to install Windows on my Mac, and I don't have my OSX installation CD with me. I see an option of Boot Camp Assistant to download the drivers online, so I select it - and it says the download is unavailable. Does anyone have a work-around? Or experience the same issue when they try it? I have a 13\" Mid-2010 MBP.\nThanks!\nZach\n\nA: There is no work around. I spent hours attempting to find one. If I were you, I would just wait until Lion, which will certainly have a work around, because there is no install disk. \n\nA: First, find on the Apple Support site the right version of the Windows drivers for Boot Camp. For instance, this link takes you to the Windows XP 32-bit drivers update and this link takes you to the Vista/XP 64-bit drivers update. Keep in mind that you may need a different download for your particular Mac, just search in the Apple Support site. Store the drivers update in a drive you can get to in Windows (like an external USB drive or \"thumb-drive\").\nThen, remember to back up your Mac. :)\nNow, run the Boot Camp Assistant on your Mac. I don't believe you need access to the OS X installation disc to use the Boot Camp Assistant. You just run the assistant, set up your partitions, and then the assistant will prompt you to insert the Windows installation disc. After Windows set up is complete, you will have a very basic version of Windows without the latest drivers installed. \nNow plug in the drive where you stored the drivers upload you previously obtained and run it. After setup is complete and the required reboot, you should see your Mac use the latest drivers. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: After reading this article for Air owners - it looks like the download is only for models that didn't include the drivers in the box with the new mac.\nYou can always contact Apple Care and order a replacement DVD - it might cost you but it will save having to find an equivalent DVD and borrowing it. It also might take a week or more to arrive so it's of less use in an urgent situation.\nI've been saved by a retail store that had the correct disk I could borrow in store to get me going while I waited for the replacement to ship.\n", "Q: Snow Leopard: Current: python 2.6 - Desired: python 2.7 Is it possible to upgrade the native python version (2.6 on my Snow Leopard) to a more recent one? Or do I have to just install python 2.7 besides the current one?\n\nA: You can install 2.7.\nIt is generally considered a bad, bad idea to change the native version, because built-in apps and frameworks are written for specifically the version that is bundled.\nThe way to go is to install 2.7 along side 2.6. This is generally considered the best practice.\nThat way, you can use 2.7 when you want, and apps will still use the version they were made for.\nGo to this page to get the Python for Mac installer. Follow the directions to install it. Then, to access the new version, type python2.7 in Terminal. You'll have a Python shell of the version specified.\n", "Q: Backup and restore application preferences I already have a backup of my system on Time Machine, but will it restore my application preferences too when I migrate to a new system? Even if it is Lion? (I come from Snow Leopard) \nAnd what about those apps that have their data in Library>Application Support?\nDo I have to manually copy and restore .plist files or is there a Backup app smart enough to copy them together with the .app file?\n\nA: Your preferences will be copied if you allow Migration Assistant to copy your data from a Time Machine backup (one of the options at the beginning of the installation).\nTime Machine backs up just about everything except Mac OS X and other system resource files. So, your preferences will be saved.\nI've tested this migrating from 10.6 to 10.6, and I've migrated from another Mac directly from 10.6 to 10.7. That process is, in practice, the same.\nSo, your preferences will be copied from your Time Machine backup to your new system.\n", "Q: To to disable a service form OS X by using recovery console? I cannot boot my system anymore and I want to disable a service from loading and the only way to do this by using the terminal window from the recovery mode.\nlaunchctl is not available in the recovery mode.\n\nA: Try doing a Safe Boot by holding down the shift key on boot. This will boot, but disable all login items/services. From there, you should be able to disable the problem and boot normally.\nMore about a Safe Boot\nHow to perform a Safe Boot\n\nA: Launchd controls all the services, so you can boot in single user mode and simply delete / move the files to a folder where launchd will leave them alone. (Often in single user mode you can look over /private/var/log/system.log and tell which task is hanging and be somewhat surgical about pruning launchd agents/daemons)\nHere are the relevant folders from the link above:\nFILES\n     ~/Library/LaunchAgents         Per-user agents provided by the user.\n     /Library/LaunchAgents          Per-user agents provided by the administrator.\n     /Library/LaunchDaemons         System-wide daemons provided by the administrator.\n     /System/Library/LaunchAgents   Per-user agents provided by Mac OS X.\n     /System/Library/LaunchDaemons  System-wide daemons provided by Mac OS X.\n\nYou can also start launchd by hand (as well as load the tasks one by one manually) once you've learned how it works - I wouldn't recommend trying it for the first time on a broken mac - test and learn first on a mac that works and is fully backed up.\n\nA: If you've disabled certain bits in launchd ... booting OS x in safe mode wont even work.\n", "Q: Early 2011 MBP Hard Drive Noise - What IS normal? I bought an early 2011 (the current model at the time of writing) 15 inch, 2.2GHz MacBook Pro.\nI had a previous generation model, pre unibody model which I loved and performed like a star.\nPerformance wise I am loving the machine but the hard drive makes such a noise under normal operation it's untrue. It sounds like a fan, but I assume there is no cooling where the HD is, but it bellows. It's not the fans - they are happy sitting there at 2,000 RPM. It can be reduced to what I would consider normal levels but putting my right hand directly above it. Very gentle pressure is enough to stop this happening. I am not sure if it is pressure or touch (e.g. grounded) related.\nThere are a bunch of people on the Apple discussion forums with the same issue, but nothing from Apple, not help from the geniuses/applecare and no obvious \"fix\". I just dropped a big chunk of change on the machine - I don't want to have to open it up or replace the drive just to make it bearable.\nAny suggestions?\nExamples: http://www.google.com/search?q=early+2011+macbook+pro+hard+drive+noise&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a\n\nA: I can tell you, this isn't normal.\nYou shouldn't hear the hard drive very much at all, and only a little chatter when you're using it extensively.\nSince you've clearly established that it's a hardware problem (because pressure fixes it), you should probably try to get it fixed. Rather than open the machine and do it yourself (violating your warranty), you should get Apple to fix it.\nSince your computer is pretty new, it should definitely be a free repair.\nYou can take it to the Apple Store and tell Apple what happens. They'll take it and do some tests, then replace the drive (or whatever part they think needs it).\nMake sure you back up all your data first; you won't get your old drive back.\n\nA: I forgot to recommend this earlier - but there is a free application on iOS devices that over simplifies storage for the technical crowd, but it's great for anyone to listen to some amazing sounds of what each failure sounds like.\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drivesaver/id317700244?mt=8\nYes it's an advert for the company's service which is data recovery - but it's clear and free and actually correct. The same information is on the internet, but this app just packages it all in an easy format.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 15\" replacement Keyboard / Keys i am using a macbook pro 15\" early 2011 unibody with an german (DE) keyboard. and that sucks really hard. So ive decided to change it, and it should be working because the english international and the german keyboard-layout are the same. \nBut here's my problem i dont really know where to buy it. Nor Apple Store neither ebay haven't something like that. Any suggestions??\nBIG thanks in advance. I'm going crazy with this german keyboard. :( \n\nA: Here is an English-language keyboard cover for the European keyboard that you already have. It costs US $30. This would provide a good solution to your problem with no need to install any parts. It is designed to remain in place all the time, while you type, and you can leave it on when you close the MacBook. In addition, the cover provides protection from spills and wear-and-tear.\nMake sure you are ordering the exact correct part for your exact model of MacBook.\nhttp://www.kbcovers.com/servlet/Detail?no=487\n\n\nA: It isn't cheap, but...\nhttp://www.welovemacs.com/6615854.html\nWhen you say apple store, do you mean the physical store, or the online store? I bet that you could go into a store and get a new keyboard. \n\nA: The keyboard keys are manufactured into the unibody top case and Apple doesn't really sell a set of key caps, but the entire topcase. So the correct way to change things would be to take apart your entire mac and re-assemble it on the new frame. I don't know of anyone making replacement keys - just silicone overlays.\nPut another way, when taking your mac apart, when everything is out and sitting on the workbench, you have the frame with all the keys sitting in your hands as a whole part.\n\nThanks to iFixit for the great photo and repair guides.\nIf you are near an Apple Retail store - I would certainly go in and have a chat with the technicians. Let them explain how many screws are there to do the work to replace all the key caps. See if they have any ideas how to help you out. Just know you will be asking them to rebuild your mac around some new plastic keys.\nI don't know if the current DE keyboard aluminum is 100% identical to the US aluminum - but in the past the return keys and key spacings were enough different that you couldn't just pop the caps and have things work. The white plastic scissors underneath the keys were different due to internal cable routing and things not obvious on the outside of the mac.\n\nA: I do not know if the official Apple Stores sell individual laptop keyboard layouts. However, if your local Apple Store does not sell them; my recommendation is to search within your city or closest major city for the mom-and-pop, brick-and-mortar, non-official Mac stores. \nFor example, I live two towns away from Austin and there is nothing good around here for my Mac accessory needs. I use a search engine to get local results for Austin and it's usually pretty easy to find a store that has just what I need. Sometimes they'll even ship  to my address. \nGood luck. \n\nA: Why not just buy one of those silicone MacBook keyboard covers and lay it over your keyboard. They're like 99 cents on Ebay as long as you don't buy the Apple branded one.\n", "Q: What should you do if your OS X system fails to boot, being stuck at gray screen with the moving wheel? What to do if your OS X system fails to boot, being stuck at gray screen with the moving-wheel?\nThe system boots from recovery partition, it does check the partition but it will not boot.\n\nA: The OS X boot process is chock full of little tasks in parallel and sequence, but it boils down to three major parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gray Screen - Hardware governed / POST / EFI / locating a boot image.\n\n*Apple Logo on Gray Screen - System level OS X processes start.\n\n*Blue Screen - User level processes starting.\n\n\nSince you haven't gotten to the blue screen - it's not anything in your user account as the system itself hasn't booted. Rather than guess what exactly has caused it, I'll link to the two articles that Apple has on getting to the nub of startup issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you see a gray screen at startup \n\n*If you see a blue screen at startup\nI am including both since you may have to solve user issues if the cause of your boot is hard drive corruption or major hardware issues. Hopefully it's just one thing in the system startup.\nIf you don't have time - start with a Safe Boot (hold shift key down) to see if you need to get your recovery disk or another bootable system. If you have a backup - you can jump to re-installing the system since that should re-write everything needed to get to a blue screen. Do run a safe boot before or after to rule out incompatible non-essential system level startup tasks - it could be as simple as one launchd problem during the system start process. The system logs will likely point you to what is going on when it pauses.\nGood Luck and let us know what you find out!\n\nA: The first thing I would do would be to use target mode to see if the internal drive mounts and if so, back up the data. Then I would run Disk Utility on it, either while it's connected via target mode or by booting from the OS DVD. Any further steps would depend on the results of these.\n", "Q: iTunes updates and Ping I'm not very savvy.  I usually accept all iTunes updates to get any important fixes.  But I don't think I need Ping - never signed up and don't use social networking.\nShould I reject iTunes update # 10 and its follow-ups, i.e., 10.3?\n\nA: You don't need to use the Ping feature if you don't want to. You can still update iTunes. After updating, just click the icon at the bottom-right of the iTunes window to hide the Ping sidebar and de-select the Ping checkbox in the General tab of iTunes' preferences window.\n\nA: I usually wait a week to a month before updating anything just to avoid getting caught surprised by any changes.\nIf it's not broken... the saying goes.\nAt some point you will have to update to take advantage of some store or new device or feature - but if you are happy with what you have, why not ignore this round of updates and enjoy what you have.\n", "Q: Final Cut Express 3.5 HD quits unexpectedly I am running FCE 3.5 HD on a Macbook Pro and whenever I start rendering, it (FCE) unexpectedly quits.

As I migrate users from Outlook to Mail, this is one of the biggest things I miss...\nWhen you forward a message in Mail.app, it gives full attribution, listing complete To, From, Subject, and Date information. However, when you reply, all you get is \"On so-and-so wrote:\" and nothing else. The big missing piece is the To information. In a corporate environment, it is really important to see who had been written to in a historical message in a thread, since the distribution group often changes from reply to reply.\nIs there any way to get the full attribution in replies as well as forwards? It must be possible. I know that you can edit the Delayed.strings file which can help space things out more desirably, but I'd like to also have all the lines (From, Date, To, Subject) there in exactly the same way.\nAny ideas or advice would be most appreciated :)\n\nA: I'd be very interested in this if you can pull it off, as that reply header format is super annoying to me.\nFor the previous version of Mail, a guy at Purdue wrote a plug-in to do exactly what we're looking for here.  He's since moved off OS X so he isn't maintaining the code for Lion, but it might serve as a good starting point for you.  The source is at:\nhttps://github.com/saptarshiguha/ReplyWithHeaders\nThe author gave me the following tip (all Greek to me, but might be helpful to you):\n\nFixing this to work in Lion might be as simple as including new UUIDs\n  (plugins require something called UUID compatibility IDs), or a\n  rewrite (the Mail internals might have changed).\n\nHope this helps!  I know a lot of people that would be very excited to fix this little shortcoming in Lion Mail.\n-Rob\n\nA: Happy to report there is a solution to this now, as Purdue's Saptarshi Guha has updated his plug-in for Lion Mail.  You can now see the standard reply header instead of that ugly Mac standard.\nhttps://github.com/saptarshiguha/ReplyWithHeaders\n\nA: One used to be able to (sort of) change \"REPLY_ATTRIBUTION” in /System/Library/Frameworks/Message.framework/Versions/B/Resources/English.lproj/Delayed.strings.\nWill try and see if that still works... (once the new Lion Xcode is downloaded....)\n\nA: The plugin mentioned above (https://github.com/saptarshiguha/ReplyWithHeaders) still works for Mountain Lion (Mail 6.5).  However, you will need to update the UUIDs as explained here: http://code2k.net/blog/2010-05-16/.  It is not as difficult as it sounds.  I'm no programmer, and it took me about 30 minutes total time.\nHope this helps.  I almost quit using Mail over this issue as I absolutely need to be able to keep track of who received what.\nRobert\nEdit:  Just had to update the UUIDs again with the version change to Mail 6.6.

I am quite a non-technical guy when it comes to such stuff and hence looking for \"easy\" solutions. \nOn Windows, I had used Red Kawa Videora to convert the various audio and video formats to iPod-playable formats. I think it also has a version which works on Mac. \nI would like to know if there is other (possibly better and as much or more user-friendly) software which does the above job of converting various audio and video formats into what Apple products can play. (I guess what works on iPod also works on iPad.)\n\nA: HandBrake used to be my go-to app for this task but lets face it: nightmare UI. Especially if you're a professed \"non-technical guy\".\nThe new wonder-in-a-box video convert is Smart Converter. Like HandBrake, it's free. Unlike HandBrake the UI is very non-threatening.

Although it says you need to pay for it, there is a free version. It may seem somewhat confusing, but it's free. As Ian C. said, Handbrake is the best video conversion software. (because it's free!!!)\n", "Q: iTunes sync process I find the whole iTunes sync process very confusing..\nI have an iPod touch and an iPad, which I generally want to sync using my MAC Mini and my PC (Windows XP). I have only 1 iTunes account though for all devices..\nNow my question is;\n1. How do I ensure that downloaded things like apps do not get erased from my iDevices whenever I sync (sometimes I notice unwanted apps coming after syncing)\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I manage the 2 computers and once I format any of the machine, it recoginzes the same PC as a new device. How do I fix this ?\n\n*With the launch of IOS5, is there some change in the syncing process ?\n\nA: *\n\n*When the device is connected to your computer, select it under Devices in the iTunes sidebar, choose \"Apps\" and enable/disable any apps that you (don't) want to sync. There's also an option \"Automatically sync new apps\" that you may want to disable if you don't want to sync new apps automatically.\n\n*You need to deauthorize the machine before doing that (in iTunes: Store > Deauthorize this Computer...). If you've already used up your five computer limit, you can also deauthorize all computers at once: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1420\n\n*iOS 5 is still in beta and under NDA, so I can't answer that question in detail. But from what Apple said in the (public) keynote: devices will be able to sync wirelessly and sync to iCloud without any computer attached to them.\n", "Q: Samba is removed from Lion. How is the role of auto_master changed I used to use the /etc/auto_master file to load SMB shares in Snow leopard Mac OS X\nNow that Samba is removed, I wonder what should be the correct way to auto mount windows shares.\n\nA: Mac OS X never used Samba's SMB client. Mac OS X has always used an SMB client implementation based on Boris Popov's smbfs for FreeBSD. I don't think that's changing in Lion, so its relation to /etc/auto_master probably isn't changing.\nAs for the SMB server side, Samba is surely being replaced with a different SMB server software package.\n", "Q: Can I give away my iPhone apps with my phone? I had an iPhone 3G that I've given to my friend. I had a number of paid apps that I left on there in the hope my friend would be able to use them, however when he tries to sync iTunes tries to delete them all.\nI no longer have an iPhone and so have no need for these apps - is there any way that I can give these apps to my friend?\n\nA: These apps go with your iTunes account.  So unless you are giving your iTunes account to that guy, he cannot keep those apps.\n\nA: TL;DR\ntechnically: yes\npractically: no\nlegal: untested, your mileage may vary\n\nOf course you can give away whatever is in your possession. Your friend can keep the apps as long as he clicks carefully and doesn't allow iTunes to delete them.\nI am not a lawyer, but I don't think you own the software - just a license to use it. If you look at the current store terms, it asks us not to transfer a license among other restrictions.\n\nYou may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer redistribute, or\n  sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Mac Computer\n  or iOS Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed\n  Application from the Mac Computer or iOS Device before doing so.\n\nTo complicate things, there may be local laws that prevent this sort of language or restriction, or other problems with an \"agreement\" where one party might not be able to change or negotiate any of the terms. Get legal advice if you are worried about this end of things.\nTechnically, the apps will run until the phone needs to be restored or the user removes one or all of the apps. The next software update will have that person either losing the apps, needing your password to download them again, or needing use of a computer that is authorized to transfer your apps to that device.\nIf you give them the password to your account, they could be nice and only access the apps or run up charges against your name or account (or even change your password).\nThe best technical workaround if you want more than one account's apps on one device is to let him sync his apps from his computer and you place your credentials on that device and download whatever purchases of yours that you want on that device. Every time the device syncs - the apps from the computer should update and it will offer to transfer your purchases - but the warning that the other password is needed to transfer will pop up each time a sync happens. Your apps won't update or delete during a sync. You could log in to update them. In practice - it's a nice way to try some things, but your friend will likely tire of the warnings and delete the apps and buy the ones he wishes to keep so his syncs are fast and warning free.\nIn the old days when it was just music and less powerful iPods, I seem to remember 5 being the big number to remember. 5 accounts worth of protected music could run on any one iPod. Your account would work on 5 computers and there was no restriction how many iPods connected to a mac so the whole neighborhood could have connected and gotten music from your one computer.\nNow it's a little harder to remember - 5 computers get purchases, up to 10 can auto download purchases and no word on how many can manually load or how many accounts are \"allowed\" technically on one device. The hassle factor keeps me from getting any more than two or three accounts purchases on any one device at the same time.\nI hope I didn't go on too long here - there's always that edit button :-)\n\nA: I'm not sure of the legalities of it, but techically it IS possible. \n\n\n*\n\n*If the device is jailbroken, your friend can ssh into the device and manually copy the apps from /var/mobile/Applications. \n\n*One by one, copy the AppName.app files into their own folder named \"Payload\"\n\n*Zip the Payload folder\n\n*Change the extension from .zip to .ipa\n\n*Drop into iTunes \n\n\nNow, in order to sync, you may have to have AppSync installed from Cydia. This guide (method 7) explains one way of doing that. \n", "Q: Questions about how Internet Sharing works A simple checkbox and a menu allow you to share your internet connection (no matter which interface you get it on) with any other interface (theoretically).\nBut, the guts of this is a little confusing. This page\nhttp://www.manpagez.com/man/8/InternetSharing/\ndescribes InternetSharing, a process which reads the property list com.apple.nat.plist stored in the /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration.\nFirst question:\nWhy is the AirPort singled out with its own special entry in the plist? I understand the entries for primary interface (the source) and the sharing devices (the targets) But who cares if AirPort is enabled in this plist if you are setting up a NAT between Ethernet and Bluetooth, for example?\nSecond question:\nWhy does it allow sharing of Ethernet connection with Ethernet connection and then give you a warning that your ISP will hate you? (It also allows Firewire with Firewire) It doesn't allow Bluetooth to Bluetooth or AirPort to AirPort; the menu entries for self-reference disappear.\nThird question:\nHow do you change the default network when you share the Ethernet through your AirPort? InternetSharing configures the IP addresses for non-AirPort interfaces starting at 192.168.2.1 and the SharingNetworkNumberStart property allows you to change that. The AirPort interface by default is assigned 10.0.2.1. How to change?\nFourth question:\nIf you only have one Ethernet jack on a MacBook how could you possibly have more than one interface? InternetSharing configures the IP addresses for non-AirPort interfaces starting at 192.168.2.1, walking up by one class C network (subnet mask 255.255.255.0) for each subsequent interface, i.e. 192.168.3.1, 192.168.4.1, 192.168.5.1, and so on. Is this to address the possibility of a Mac Pro or an Xserve with multiple NICs?\n[SOLVED]\n1) the airport is not like the other interfaces\n2) the hard connections are less likely to connect to themselves-you actually have to WIRE them and nobody would do that\n3)edit the bootpd.plist\n4) usb adapters\ntnx. i solved the problem. even tho i turned off the firewall in the gui, ipfw was still running. sudo ipfw list gave the same list of rules regardless whether i had firewall on or off. dont know how i managed to achieve that!\nI looked to noobproof and turned off the rule for blocking port 80. Now it works, at least for web surfing.\n\nA: As @bmike said, Internet Sharing hides a lot of complexity behind a very simple interface, and some of your questions can't be answered authoritatively without interviewing some of the Apple engineers behind it.  But that won't stop me from taking a stab at it...\n1) AirPort is different from the other interface types because in order to share over AirPort, your Mac has to actually create the wireless network (as opposed to just providing service over an existing ethernet, FireWire, etc connection).  This means that InternetSharing needs to have a bunch of info about how to create the wireless network: network name (SSID), channel, security, etc.\n2) Resharing over the same ethernet interface is useful under some circumstances.  For example, on my home network my ISP provides limited number of static IP addresses for my use.  I run a Mac doing the equivalent of Internet Sharing (actually, I set up the daemons manually as @Spiff recommended) to reshare over the same ethernet.  Result: if I put a computer on my home ethernet and config it via DHCP, I get a private (behind-the-firewall) IP address from my virtually unlimited internal pool.  If I manually config the computer with one of the public IPs, I get full unfitered internet access, but use up one of my limited public IP pool.  Because they're both on the same network, \"moving\" a computer behind or in front of the firewall is just a simple configuration switch.\nOn the other hand, if you did this same trick on an ethernet network that already had a DHCP server, computers attaching to the network would randomly get configuration from one server or the other, leading to unpredictability, confusion, and hair-pulling.  It's definitely a use-only-if-you-know-what-you're-doing feature.  Fortunately, Internet Sharing is smart: if it detects another DHCP server on \"its\" private network, it shuts itself off to avoid trouble.\n3) I don't know of a way to change the private IP range on an IS-created wireless network.  On the other hand, it shouldn't really matter, since the network is being created by Internet Sharing, and therefore it doesn't have to worry about conflicts with any existing network numbering.\n4) You can add interfaces with Apple's USB Ethernet Adapter. Get some USB hubs, and pile them on!\n\nA: I think you oversimplify the sharing process. It's much more complicated than your initial paragraph. Firewall, nat/dhcp and networking concepts will kill you if you don't have some good foundation on basic conventions and rules as well as how networks were designed to work.\n1) Why? I don't know - the snarky answer is to ask the engineers at Apple to share their thinking. Rather than speculate - feel free to ask a more concrete question that can be answered.\n2) I don't know about hate - but I get a \"you may disrupt the network\" since many networks assume each client is an end point - not a gateway to more traffic that it has to handle differently. You can break your mac's connection as well as break the other people on the network. Your ISP won't care unless you call them to fix a problem you created :-)\n3) Decide if you want to map out your network using DHCP or manually. Decide if you want one network or two. Once you read up on what a subnetwork is -  you'll see you likely need a software router to bridge addresses not on the current router's subnet. The implementation depends on which way you decide to go.\n4) It's called interface aliasing. Study up on the layers that make up the IP model and you will have a better feel for how you can add multiple second layer data on top of one physical link level network connection.\nDon't give up, I can see how much work you put into your question - keep asking and you'll find a lot of really knowledgeable people here will chip in as their time allows to help you out. Entice them by asking really well researched and specific questions.\n\nA: The Internet Sharing feature has always seemed to be a simple-to-set-up service via the Sharing panel in System Preferences. I'm surprised they even documented the InternetSharing daemon with a man page.\nIf the settings you can easily access from the GUI are insufficient for your needs, I recommend you jump right into configuring and invoking the other underlying daemons yourself, rather than messing with InternetSharing and nat.plist.\nipfw, natd, bootpd, and named are powerful and worth learning to use directly.\n", "Q: Mac Mini has loud fan, won't power up My intel-based mac mini (Model A1283, EMC 2336) refuses to boot. When I plug it in, the fan spins up very loudly, but then nothing happens when I hit the power button. I don't get a boot chime, and the power light on the front doesn't turn on.\nI've followed the directions here for resetting the SMC, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.\nWhat are my options? Do I need to schlep it in for some applecare attention?\n\nA: The best option would be to systematically go through the manufacturer steps for troubleshooting a mac mini that won't boot. Even if you don't see the power light - do run through the no video steps as well - it might save you a trip or a call with a tech.\nBest of luck!\n", "Q: Getting field data from a Bento database using Applescript I'm having problems getting the field values out of a Bento database using Applescript:\nI'mn using the following code to get at the entries but I'm not able to get at the cells or fields associated with the entries.

The dictionary seems to indicate that the data lies there and not as easily accessed from a collection.

I'm looking for a free GUI app to help run programs on a schedule.  It seems that launchd is the underlying tool to use, and in the past Lingon has been recommended as a good GUI interface to launchd.\nBut now it seems that the open source (Apache License V2.0) version of Lingon 1.2.1 doesn't work on Leopard (10.5), and the newest version of Lingon (2.2.1) requires Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6 or later and is no longer open source.\nHas anyone gotten a version of Lingon to run on Leopard (10.5)?\nOr is there another free alternative?\nUpdate - thanks to Mark I found and tried 2.1.1 which seems to work.  But it requires a restart or logout when making a change - is that always needed for launchd?  Or just for Lingon?

Sometimes the Dock will keep an icon app in the Dock, even though I haven't set it as such, even though I've previously de-kept it in Dock after the first time it kept it 'for me'. \nIs there a way to turn this off it's a bit annoying? \n\nA: go to \"system preferences\", then choose \"Dock\" and uncheck the \"show recent applications in dock\" radio button. \n\nA: Usually apps don't place themselves in the dock without your consent or knowledge. There are a couple ways to put them there though. Perhaps you may not realize it, but it may be one of these reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The App Store will place an app in the Dock upon installation. Note: Lion will not do this though; it simply places it in Launchpad.\n\n*The App Store will place an app in the Dock upon updating an app. Note: Updating an non-docked app individually via the updates tab is when it gets re-placed in the dock. However using the 'Update All' button at the top of the page will not do any such thing. Again, this is changed in Lion.\n\n*If you run an app that is not kept in the dock and drag it to another position anywhere on the dock, it will stay in the dock\n\n*Drag an app into the dock from Finder\n\n*Right click an app in the dock an under options select 'Keep in Dock'\n\n", "Q: AFP File Sharing not Working I am having trouble with AFP Sharing a backup drive from one computer to another.

Check the server name or IP address, check your network connection, and then try again.\n\nI have used ping on both computers to make sure the LAN is working, and it is. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Disable IPv6 and WiFi.  Plug both in via Ethernet.  Verify your targets IP.  Turn AFP and all other sharing settings off on the target, and wait for it to disappear from the sidebar on the machine you're connecting from.  Then re-enable AFP sharing on the target, and see it come back on the source.\nPing the IP, or even the name (foo.local if the computer's name is foo).  Try connecting by clicking on it from the sidebar - failing that try using the Go menu (connect to server) and putting in a URL in the format afp://<name or IP here>.\nLet us know how it goes.\nEDIT: then, once that works properly, change one thing at a time.  Enable WiFi on one machine and remove the ethernet cable.  Then test.  Then do the same on the other machin, and test.  Then enable IPv6 on one.. test.  Then the other.  Etc, until you've worked your way back to how you want your machines to be set up.

Launchd is an interesting piece of software. It seems like it is working ok, but one would think the brand new way of replacing init would have a few more iterations.\nIs launchd still under active development? The last svn checkin was 2009, the mailing list is not that vibrant, unless i'm looking at the wrong one... and all the tutorials online are from 2006 or so.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: If the last time Apple publicly posted sources to launchd was when Snow Leopard shipped, it may be that there were no critical bugs in launchd that were worth fixing in Snow Leopard software updates, so none of the post-Snow-Leopard updates to the Darwin sources would contain any launchd changes.\nWhen Lion ships, you can expect to see a huge new drop of Darwin sources based on Lion.  You may find that a lot has been going on behind the scenes over the last 2 years. Or not. But given that Apple has said Lion will ship sometime this month, your question might be 2 weeks premature.\n\nA: Not publicly. \nFor some reason, no one is working on the only current proposal to have launchd parse local times like sunset and phases of the moon. \n\nA: launchd continues to be actively developed by Apple.\nFor OS X 10.10, Yosemite, launchd was completely rewritten.

In the past - from time to time - you could feel a bit of electricity close to the aluminium case when working in AC mode, but now things are getting worse. I can feel the electricity all the time, especially close to the opening button and to the corners. Talking with other MBP users, I have been told that the whole MBP 1.4 series has got this problem and that it is due to the presence of the aluminium case. Is it a known issue? Is there any workaround to properly ground the laptop?\n\nA: I ended up with the solution in this link. You just need to connect 3 ping adapter's earth and the earth pin of the charger.\n\n\nA: Here's a simple fix to this design flaw. Whoever thought of ending the ground circuit at the pin on the transformer, where it connects to the plastic channel on the UK plug adapter needs to be sent on a long holiday. I finally got my Trackpad working (while the charger's plugged into the computer), by ensuring continuity between the transformer's earth pin and the one on the UK wall plug.\n\n\nA: Actually, this problem gets really bad, when you connect a 3.5mm plug from your headphones to your MBP, you can hear the buzz from the electricity, I must unplug the MBP from the electrical outlet to avoid that buzzing sound (which is realy high and loud), I must find a way to ground the laptop, I have found that if I touch it it reduces the amount of buzzing sound, so I will connect a cable from the body to some sort of metal to see if that helps, until i found a longer solution. \n\nA: tl;dr\nUse the extension cord! It is grounded.\nApple's grounding madness\nYou need your device to be grounded. The charger can be grounded because the metal pin that holds the adapter is (subtly) also the ground:\n\nYou need the plug to be grounded too. Obviously a 2 pin/prong plug is not grounded, you'll need one with 3 of them, but even in this case you have to check if the adapter's socket/shoe has metal in it (AKA is connected to the ground), because you can't take that granted at Apple! Just check out this picture from this article:\n\nThis is a 3 prong UK plug that has a grounding prong, but they haven't connected it! Fortunately at the extension cord there is a connection. You have to carry that extra 1.8 meter of cable tho...\nSo at Apple, the rule of thumb is that if it is an extension cord, then the socket is connected to the ground pin so it is probably grounded, if it is the small adapter, then there is no connection in the socket so no grounding for you:\n\nThe left picture from this answer shows the difference. The metal is more visible in the magnified picture on the right.\nHacky solution\nTechnically you could hack the not grounded 3 prong UK (Type G) adapter (that I mentioned before) to connect the ground prong to the grounding pin as shown in this tutorial. Of course, unless you want to use it with a Type G socket instead of the many other types, you will need to use another (grounded!) adapter to convert it to your desired (grounded!) wall socket.\n\nA: Your specific mac only grounds itself through the magsafe connector if you are using a grounded plug. In the US, standard power means the \"duck head\" two prong connector is ungrounded. (Or unearthed to some) Use a three conductor plug to ground the device and check your MagSafe pins to be sure they extend fully and mate correctly with the Mac.\nThe adapter article from Apple has some good tips and a nice picture.\n\nYou shouldn't be able to feel any tingle due to you being better grounded than the mac if your outlet is properly grounded.\nYou'll have to check with an electrician or take your mac to another outlet that is known to be properly grounded if you are already grounding it through the wall if you still feel the tingle with a grounded cord.\nThis sort of ground current drives me nuts (even though it's normally totally safe). I have on occasion intentionally grounded one of the plastic feet with foil when I am waiting for the electrician to fix an outlet or I am working in a location where I can't get a proper ground.\n\nA: Well I have just experienced this tingle on my Macbook Pro with the magsafe 85w power supply and the 3 pin plug lead with a UK 3 pin plug.  \nI could not believe that Apple would not earth the machine via the magsafe adapter, so I detached the power lead from the 85w power supply block and took a look how they earth it.  The power supply block has a 2 pin connection for live and neutral and the earth connects via the 10mm dia stainless steel stud that the plug lead [or the plug with no lead] slips over to lock it onto the block.  Then I saw the problem! On the end of the 10mm stud, the manufacturer had put a 12mm disk of protective plastic [the peal-off film type that you often find on say a new phone screen]. So in their efforts to keep the stud looking shiny and polished, they insulated it from electrical connection, that is they insulated the EARTH STUD !!  Just peal it off, plug it back together and [unsurprisingly] there is no more tingle from the alloy case.  \n\nA: I accidentally solved this problem by connecting my macbook pro to an external monitor(using USB type to VGA adapter and connected monitor via VGA cable). Since the monitor is using 3 pin power connector for power supply, so indirectly my macbook also got earthed. I tested this using electrical tester pen screwdriver and it shows zero current on macbook body if the setup is connected. Also, i don't feel the current anymore even if I touch the macbook bare foot.\n\nA: Use the extension cable that comes with the magsafe as that has an earth connection to the 10mm stud which is not present on the non extended plug block\n\nA: To add to this: if you buy 3rd party power supplies to replace genuine they often do not have an earth* (the stub which the cable slides onto is plastic, but the Americans barely use earth on the American model of this laptop, and seem to survive.\n*AKA 'ground' \n\nA: The same problem is now evident with the new MacBook Air.  I called Apple and they admit there is a lack of earthing/grounding when the UK 3 pin plug connector is in use. Apple quote a UL and IEC approval which says that no earthing is required where the amperage induced is negligible.  While I'm not suggesting that the levels of current are harmful they are intensely irritating requiring me to stop working, lick my finger and touch the metal case.  This WAS NOT the case on my old Air book. \n\nA: There is no protective plastic On the end of the 10mm stud with any of the 2013 models. So what you are saying, Paul Churchill, is incorrect. The problem with electrical current flowing through all the MacBooks can not be fixed. Only Apple can fix it, but they don't want to fix it.\nOf course it is unhealthy & unnatural when an external electrical current flows through your body, no matter how small. It messes up your whole electrical system in your body. All nerve signals, all organ and all functions in general in your body function through the bodies own electrical current system.\nI have noticed it too, and will return all my Apple products that conduct electrical current. So please watch out if you care about your health and don't want to get seriously sick in the long run.\n", "Q: Using a virtual machine as a network tap on a mac server hoping for the virtual machine to be a 'network tap'.\nconfiguration is an intel mac with an airport card and several usb nics. The airport card is for connectivity to the internet. the usb nics provide connectivity to the local lan. internet sharing is used on the mac to distribute internet access and the mac is also a file repository. \nInternet sharing on the mac results in a dhcp serving addresses in a different class c for each nic-so one nic for example will get 192.168.2.x, the next nic gets 192.168.3.x, etc. This allows each nic to service a whole lan segment. Wireshark installed on the mac sees all interfaces and allows monitoring of traffic. I do not want to run wireshark natively on the mac. It's a production machine and messing around with the bare metal is discouraged. A virtual appliance is perceived as safer (even though it may not be, i cannot convince the responsible higher ups) \nSo, vmware fusion is set up on the mac to run an instance of windows xp sp3. wireshark is installed on windows.in this configuration, wireshark only sees the airport but not the usb nics. The network adapters are set up in bridged mode on vmware. Is there a tutorial that clarifies setup for the nics in fusion and the proper ip addresses they should have in windows? Should they be bridged there as well? If i use the same ip as that used on the mac, obviously i get an ip address conflict.\nI was hoping for the virtual machine to be a 'network tap' but it's having trouble seeing the nics, let alone the traffic that is not even destined for it. i guess another way to solve this problem is to get the traffic to go through the xp instance. XP would need a dhcp server running. This dhcp server would service the nics. i tried tftpd but that is a little too rudimentary- it does not see the virtual interfaces. i'll keep looking but need some enlightenment.\nplease be gentle. \n\nA: In bridged mode, the VM's port gets its own Ethernet MAC address. If VMNet acts like a switch, you might not see packets destined for the Mac's network node, which I assume is the point of this exercise.\nYes, the virtual port needs it's own IP address as well.\nInternet sharing just passes along traffic not destined for the machine that is sharing. It is not a network bridge (it runs as a NAT IIRC), so it won't pass along broadcasts either.\n", "Q: Can an Apple TV 2 be operated without HDMI plugged in? (This question is related in goal, but not method.)\nShortly after launch, I bought the new Apple TV. A few months later, my girlfriend and I broke up and the HDTV went with her. Apple TV returned to his box, never to be seen or heard from again. I know, terrible!\nI've been pondering how I could send tunes to the stereo in my office without running a 20ft cable to my headphones jack, since all the error noises would be pretty disruptive and whatnot. Then I remembered, Apple TV has a Toslink port.\nI think that using this, this and this, I should be able to just AirPlay from iTunes. I'm worried, though, that the set-top box might be a bit offended that I don't plan on giving it an HDMI buddy.\nHas anyone done this before?\n\nA: I know for sure Apple TV works fine with AirPlay to send audio out the Toslink (digital optical) with or without a HDMI cable connected.\nThe converter you linked to seems to take RCA (electric) digital signal and turns it into Toslink (optical) digital signal so I doubt that's exactly what you want to get to a headphone jack with analog stereo (electric) signal.\nSince it's not clear what input your stereo wants, it's unclear if everything will work, but the Apple TV will work as you ask.\nI have this setup (but Toslink to my speaker) as well as a second stereo connected via bluetooth and a Belkin receiver that connects to the normal 1/8\" headphone jack. That might be cheaper than cables and an adapter if the distance is 30 feet or less.\n\nA: Even if the AppleTV functions without the HDMI connected, you will have no way to figure out what's going on when you have problems or when the AppleTV pops up a dialog such as the \"Update available, update now or later?\" dialog.\nI suggest you sell the AppleTV and buy an Airport Express, which is designed to do what you're trying to accomplish. The Airport Express can be managed by any computer on the same network. Yes, you will lose a little money this way but you may find that it's no more than you plan to spend on the converters and cables for the AppleTV.\n", "Q: Installed additional python2.7 to Snow Leopard. What happens to modules I want to install? I recently asked if I should upgrade python 2.6 to python 2.71 on my Mac (Snow Leopard). I was told to install 2.7 without removing 2.6. Done!\nNow I was wondering how the installation of new modules is handled:\nDoes both 2.6 and 2.7 access the same place where all new python modules are installed by pip, easy_install and setup.py? Is there something I have to take care of?\nAnother question occured to me: How do I tell a script that I have written to be run by python 2.7.2?\n\nA: Install of python modules goes in x/Library/FrameworksPython.framework/Versions/2.6 etc where x depends on the install.\nnothing for the one from Apple as port of OSX. python executable in /usr/bin\nnothing for pythons from python.org. python executable in /usr/local/bin\n/opt/local if installed via macports (as I do)\nYou have to look at easy_install etc to see the path to the python they use. e.g. /usr/bin/easy_install has /usr/bin/python so using this will install in /Library/FrameworksPython.framework/Versions/2.6.\nYou cannot choose to run under a minor version of  python e.g. 2.7.2 as only one major version at a time is set up normally e.g. 2.7.2 replaced 2.7.1\nEach major version of python will have its own executable e.g. python2.7 s to have a script use that verstio make it begin with #!/usr/bin/env python2.7 pr the full path.\n", "Q: Mac Book Pro - 5 400 tr/min or 7 200 tr/min? I'm buying a mac book pro (this one: http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MC723LL/A?mco=MjEyOTY4OTQ).\nMy doubt is: \n\n\n*\n\n*5400 tr/min 750Gb or\n\n*7200 tr/min 500Gb ?\n\n\nI would appreciate the extra space but I'm afraid of the 5400 be really really slower than 7200.\nWhat do you think?\n\nA: If you're not hammering the hard drive all the time, say by doing HD video work, then you're not going to notice. In that case, the 5400 might be better because it is larger, takes less power and is less likely to fail.\n", "Q: Does LED Cinema Display work with non Mac systems? Not sure if this question if more appropriate in this Mac site or a non Mac site, but:\nCan the current (as possibly soon to be updated) Apple 27 inch LED Cinema Display be used with non Mac systems such as those running Windows or Linux? What would it take to make it happen?\nThanks.\n\nA: You can use the current version with other hardware, but it isn't trivial.\nThe LED Cinema Display connects to Macs using a Mini DisplayPort, which isn't popular on non-Apple hardware. However, you can get a converter like this one that lets you use the monitor with an HDMI connection. So, if the other machine has an HDMI out you could use that. I'm sure you can also find converters to use with VGA or DVI outputs.\nThe next version of the display will (almost certainly) use ThunderBolt instead of Mini DisplayPort. The physical connector is the same, but the data that travels over the cable is very different. These converters may or may not work with ThunderBolt; we'll have to wait for the product to come out and for someone to test.\n\nA: There are easily 40 PCI graphics cards listed on Amazon alone that work with non Mac computers and have Mini DisplayPort outputs.\nYou've got lots of options if you have a true DisplayPort signal. There's nothing proprietary about the connector or the monitor as it's basically HDMI/DVI over a different pin configuration. Be careful if you get a converter - the cheap ones take MiniDP and send it to HDMI - you'll need one that goes the other way if your video source is HDMI or DVI since the Apple monitor expects a miniDP signal.\nDo pay attention to HDCP capabilities of the graphics card or connector if you will want to play media that has DRM or other copy protection.\n", "Q: Replacing AirPort card on my Macbook I have a White MacBook model 3,1 (bought in 2007).\nMy AirPort card seems to be busted. It has trouble picking up WiFi from a transmitter that is more than one meter away.\nI know it's not an OS issue because I also have Ubuntu and Windows installed on this machine, and I'm having connectivity issues there too.  \nI want to replace it, but before I buy a new one I wanted to know if there are different models available, maybe something newer and better. Or is a new card of the model I currently have (AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0x88) according to my System Profiler) my only option?\nAnd While on the topic, where is best to buy such card? is eBay ok?\n\nA: I would not recommend using any other model or spec with your macbook, you could try ebay, but for service parts that you can trust you could also buy from www.welovemacs.com, who I can recommend.\nHope this is helpful.\n\nA: It's possible that you've got a damaged radio front-end module on your wireless card, but it's just as possible that you have disconnected or damaged antenna cables. On almost all models of Mac laptops, the Wi-Fi antenna cables go into or through the \"clutch barrel\" (hinge) of the display, and if you or someone else opened up the guts of your machine and didn't get the antenna cables positioned correctly when putting it back together, your cables could have become worn and frayed by rubbing against sharp edges while opening and closing your display.\nMy point is that you shouldn't just assume you need a new card. It may turn out to be much less severe, like you just need to plug a connector back in that worked its way loose over time. Or it may turn out to be a bit more of a pain, like if you need to replace the antenna cable assembly, which is difficult.\n\nA: I'm not able to post comments yet but first I think we need more information about your problem.\nYou mention having Ubuntu and Windows on this macbook.\n\"know it's not an OS issue because I also have Ubuntu and Windows installed on this machine.\" \nAre you experiencing WiFi issues on the Macbook when you're in Windows or Ubuntu?  I think if the card was the issue, it would recur regardless of the OS?  Not sure what I'm missing.\nMy suggestion/answer for this situation is to borrow someone's USB wifi card and see if the problem persists when you've connected via the usb dongle.\n", "Q: how to page down when running top? When running top in terminal, I can't find a way to scroll down to view all running processes (save for resizing the window, but even then I can't display all). I tried setting and using the page down key command in the preferences, but that didn't work.\nAnyone know how to scroll down in the list of processes in top?\n\nA: Unfortunately, top is not scrollable; you're meant to sort the process list to shorten it to what you want.\nhtop is a more-powerful alternative that is scrollable. Here's how to install it on Mac OS X.\nOr, you could use Activity Monitor from /Applications/Utilities.\n", "Q: Mac software for developing a product video I'm looking to develop a video for a software application that I make. I'm willing to spend a lot of time learning the software, so features are more important than simplicity.\nI've got access to the full Adobe CS5 Suite, however I don't think anything in there suites my needs: Premiere Pro and After Effects seem more orientated to video shot with a camera than screenshots, adding text, etc. But I may be wrong.\nWhat I want is a professional video with good voiceovers, slick movement, screenshots and some demonstrations of the product. Some effects will be required - It should look professional, not like something done in Movie Maker.\nAny ideas? Multiple pieces of software used together is fine (I'm sure CS5 will come in useful in some regards).\n\nA: You want ScreenFlow. The website isn't all that well designed, but ScreenFlow itself is a very nice and nice-looking Mac app. \nDepending on how fancy you want to get with transitions and effects, you might find it useful to export clips from ScreenFlow and composite them in something else. But there are plenty of product demo videos for popular Mac apps that  were done completely in ScreenFlow (examples elude me; help, commenters?).\n\nA: There are two basic scenarios when creating product videos.  There is continuous video and discrete video.  \nDiscrete video is like a Powerpoint display with audio.  This type of video is best created with Adobe Captivate.  Captivate is very easy to use and one can produce high quality videos without making the video files too large.  \nCamtasia is great for producing continuous video.  I've found it easy to use.  File sizes are larger than for Captivate but continuous video requires more frames.  \n\nA: For the product demo I'm a fan of Shiny White Box's IShowU HD Pro. It's a good price, super easy to use and has presets for the major video sites such as youtube and vimeo. All the stuff you expect. \nThat + iMovie would make it easy to develop a professional looking video relatively easily and cheaply.\n\nA: Placeit.net now has a video feature. You basically record your screen (iOS simulator or appetize.io) and the app adds hand gestures and everything. You'd only need to add voiceover and maybe titles if you need.\n", "Q: How can I automatically log out the guest account after a period of inactivity? As part of a kiosk system, I have set up a Guest account on a Mac OS X Snow Leopard computer. This account is cleared every time someone logs off the computer. However, plenty of people don't. Is there any way that I can automatically log out this guest account after a period of inactivity?\nI tried using the security preferences pane, but that just causes the confirm logout dialog to show up.\nI have hacked around the /System/Library/User Templates/ folder, so I can set the screensaver, desktop background, &c. If something like ScriptSaver can solve my problem, I will gladly use it.\n\nA: Maybe you could consider using SleepWatcher instead of the Security.prefPane; it´s a unix utility you could use to force a logout (or anything else via AppleScript) after a certain period of inactivity.\n\nA: You can use a commercial product called Power Manager to log out a user after a period of inactivity.\nPower Manager will warn the user before starting the log out. During log out any open applications will be quit; applications attempting to block log out will be force quit after a short delay.\n\nDisclosure: I work for the company who make Power Manager.\n\nA: Haven't tried this with a aGuest account, but no reason it shouldn't work there.\nIn \n\nSystem Preferences > Security > General\n\nis a checkbox labeled \"Log out after XX minutes of inactivity\"\nHere set your desired minute amount and let it do the magic!\n", "Q: Getting multiple Apple IDs Is it possible to have multiple Apple IDs? \nCan I have different Apple Ids using my different email ids? \n\nA: Yes, an Apple ID is per email address, so you can have multiple Apple IDs in the same store, or different store.\n\nA: Having 2 Apple ID's is possible. Go to the AppleID website and create an new apple ID by filling in the requested information. You will most likely need to use an email not registered to an Apple ID yet, and possibly a phone number as well. \nYou may use one apple ID to sync to your icloud, and your second Apple ID to log into all of your Apple Purchases and Store accounts i.e. iTunes, iBooks, etc. The above users are right, in that you can not merge these two accounts. However, you can turn on \"family sharing\" to link these accounts, in order to share purchased apps accross each account.\n\nA: I agree with Anthony Green's reply as you can have multiple Apple Accounts. But as of this time I would recommend against it as you can't merge account purchases to one account. So if you're going to use the upcoming iCloud service you can only sync one account with it, so anything on the second account that you have purchased will not sync. \nHopefully Apple will allow you to sync account purchases from multiple accounts to one master account in the future but who knows, sigh...\n", "Q: Installing LaTeX on iMac For years I have been a LaTeX user on Ubuntu. I want to know how to install/use LaTeX on Mac.\nI generally use it to write mathematically intensive documents and make slides (on beamer). In future I am likely to use a lot of photographs on my slides. \nI would be glad if someone can tell me what is the good way to install LaTeX on Mac. (..and also how to run it..) I am comfortable compiling it from some terminal. \nI was looking at MacTeX, is that good (or the only one!?)\nI was wondering if that comes bundled with a text editor too optimized for LaTeX. If not then kindly suggest me a good editor too. I am used to GEdit on Ubuntu. \nFor editor I was looking at TeXShop.\nSo will I have to install both TeXShop and MacTeX ? \n\nA: TeXShop is already included in MacTex (also LaTeXiT, which is probably more interesting for you). Basically, MacTex is a carefree package, which should include everything you would ever need in a  LaTex distribution. This really is the best way to install LaTex on a Mac, it's easy and requires little to no configuration (basically what you get used to on a Mac).\nIf you just want a text editor and run all the LaTeX command in Terminal, you can use TextWrangler, which is free and very good. It's not LaTex specific though and doesn't do any LaTex highlighting. If you want that, you may want to look at Aquamacs Emacs, which does very good highlighting.\n\nA: It sounds like your needs from the distribution are pretty standard, so MacTeX is definitely your best bet, as René and olivier mention. The MacTeX package does include TeXShop, and it also includes TeXWorks, which is a similar editor (but also runs on Ubuntu). It also includes several other lovely perks, like the LaTeX-aware spell-checker Excalibur and a distribution-managing System Prefs pane (TeX Live Utility).\nI would like to mention that you can install gedit on OS X, and it offers LaTeX syntax highlighting by default. Though I would prefer to use TeXShop, if you're looking for a truly seamless transition, you could edit your document using gedit and compile in the command line.\n\nA: MacTeX is the right one. It has an installer and doesn't require any technical skill. It includes some softwares and TeXShop is among them (as well as LaTeX It).\nYou can probably compile and install LaTeX \"by hand\" in the terminal, but that would be a lot more difficult to get it to work, I think.\nI use MacTeX essentially with LaTeX It to include complex equations in iWork documents and it works flawlessy !\nI don't edit large documents in LaTeX, but Scribo is a native app (in beta) to do just that and it looks promising. You may want to take a look at it.\n", "Q: Wifi on Macbook vs Macbook Pro How will you rate your wifi experience and over all experience between Macbook and Macbook pro?\nHow much of that good or bad is to do with Aluminium body?\n\nA: The new 450 megabit per second (a.k.a. 3 spacial stream, 3x3) flavor of 802.11n on the Thunderbolt MacBook Pros is very nice, especially when combined with the latest AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule revisions from June that have modern 450 megabit per second 802.11n radios.\nThe plastic MacBooks and the MacBook Airs are still running the older 300 megabit per second flavor of 802.11n from 2007.\n\nA: I has an old Macbook (white one) and now i have an alu-Pro and haven't see any differences in the Wifi performance. But maybe someone others has more exact comparison.\n", "Q: how to start/stop/restart processes As a new comer from Windows OS, I wonder how to start/stop/restart a service on Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8 ?(it's straight forward on Windows using its Task Manager).\nI tried Activity Monitor, but it only kills processes, it does not start them.\nI tried the command: launchctl stop *servicename*  and then the command launchctl start *servicename* after I hit return on keyboard after each command the terminal does not show any message so it must be successfull, but when I check out the result in Activity Monitor, it sounds that this command is useless because it has no effect on that process in Activity Monitor.\np.s.

If mean never, mean in normal usage, of course sometimes needed use it when installing somethings from the macports - for onetime load of startup files or so.\nI'm wondering, why you need start/stop/restart services with launchctl? Asking because if you not an experienced OS X users you probably will screw the system \"harmony\" :). So, in this case - IMHO - better to ask the specific problem, so ask how to start/stop the specific service.\n\nI don't see a problem with asking the wider question as to how services are started and stopped if it enables the OP to better understand the underlying mechanics of the system.\nAs to why you would want to do this, one good reason would be to remotely kill errant processes on remote machines via Apple Remote Desktop. I do this frequently for our network users at school and it can save a lot of leg work (as well as avoiding entering repetitive terminal commands).\nARD users will want to kill processes by name rather than by PID as the process ID isn't necessarily the same each time the process is initiated...\nsudo killall coreaudiod\n\n...would be a useful command for ARD users as it's repeatable regardless of PID, whereas...\nsudo kill -1 211\n\n...would very likely only work to kill coreaudiod on the occasion that its PID was actually 211, and definitely wouldn't be an ARD command worth saving for future use. This may seem obvious to \"advanced\" users but unfamiliar users may not realise the difference.\n\nA: It is strange to see the questions between \"windows migrated\" and \"default mac\" users. :) Windows migrated users usually want \"somewhat tweak\" the system. Default Mac users - simply \"using it\".\nI'm using MAC much years, and never needed to use the launchctl command. If mean never, mean in normal usage, of course sometimes needed use it when installing somethings from the macports - for onetime load of startup files or so.\nI'm wondering, why you need start/stop/restart services with launchctl? Asking because if you not an experienced OS X users you probably will screw the system \"harmony\" :). So, in this case - IMHO - better to ask the specific problem, so ask how to start/stop the specific service.\n\nAs the answer - check first System preferences. Most common services are in the \"Sharing\" pane\" - like web-server, sshd, CD sharing and so on...\nSome third party dmg files with GNU stuff comes with own preference pane too. For example, you can install precompiled MYSQL server with a preference pane, what allow you start-restart the server.\nIf you don't find the wanted service in prefs, be more precise. What service you need start/stop? The \"launchctl\" command works as needed to work, ActivityMonitor too. You ofc can use \"ps axuwww\" or \"top\" commands from the Terminal too.\nRemember, your now in the UNIX world, so nearly anything can be done from the command-line, but usually thats mean really much learning.. ;)\n\nEDIT:\ntry:\nsudo kill -1 204\n              ^-process number\n\nfrom the terminal, or simply kill the daemon from the ActivityMonitor.

I use the terminal on a daily basis, I will often use rm DirectoryName. Sometimes I get a little impatient and do rm * without deliberating if it’s safe. As you can imagine, these shenanigans have sometimes come back and hit me in the face. Does anyone know how I create a mapping so rm whatever moves everything to the trashcan which I then delete manually.\n\nA: Use a command line tool like rmtrash (which usually just moves the file(s) to ~/.Trash making sure that the file has a unique name) or a script that uses appscript to call the Finder to do the delete. The latter is slower but adds the ability to use the Put Back option fromn Finder to restore the file easily.\nI used trash as it is in in MacPorts and Homebrew and rmtrash is now very old and unmaintained. However on reading the code changes when editing this note I noticed that it changed in 2017 from using the Finder by default to move by default (which is not what I wanted and is a major change). So I will look for another tool.\nAs noted in the comments it is not a good idea to make rm an alias best to remember to use the trash program you installed directly\nBut if you wanted to you could do\nAfter installing rmtrash to say /usr/local/bin/rmtrash then you can  create an alias for bash\nalias rm='rmtrash'\n\nYou can use \\rm to call rm directly and ignore the alias\n\nA: Just want to add a helpful habit to get into for those that don't do this already.  Before using rm for anything, do 'ls' on it first.  That way you can see all the files that you intend to delete.  Then instead of retyping, just pull previous 'ls' command up and swap out ls for rm. This habit has reduced a lot of anxiety when invoking rm. \n\nA: There are ways to protect yourself from horrible outcomes from rm. However, I agree with the other commenters here: very few are any good.\nDo not for a minute believe that changing the command environment will help you. For example, you will find people online everywhere recommend doing this sort of thing:\nalias rm=\"rm -i\"\n\nor\nfunction rm()\n{\n    echo >&2 'rm forbidden; use \"/bin/rm\"'\n}\nexport -f rm\n\nThis will not work. Period. There are loads of use cases where these little parlor tricks will fail you miserably.\nThe only robust way I have used to spare myself from the danger of rm is by setting up a regular backup process through cron over the directories where I work.  Raw UNIX does it for you nicely, with great simplicity, using find in conjunction with -mtime to check for files that have been updated within or since a certain time.\n\nA: I can think of a dozen ways to code this, but categorically refuse to type any of them up in an answer. I strongly recommend you curb your habit of getting a little crazy. You shouldn't be in the habit of using rm at all if you can't use it properly.\nThe fundamental problem here is that even if you install a safety net on your own system, that will only help you keep your bad habits and when you happen to be on another machine some day that doesn't have the same custom protections, you will do something epicly bad.\nThe proper solution is to use rm as it was meant to be used including manually adding the -i argument whenever you are in doubt about how a glob will expand, and have good system backups that you can restore in the event of serious user error. Trying to add \"trash\" to commands that in the rest of the universe don't use it is a half-way step that is the worst of both worlds.\nEither use the trash or don't. Using rm doesn't go to trash, it removes.\nIf you want to use the trash, there is nothing wrong with that. Just get in the habit of using the rmtrash command instead of rm. This will help your brain understand what's happening and not get you into a bad habit that will cause grief later.\n\nA: Bad Idea\nUsing rm to move files to the trash is a dopamine hit. It is common and pleasuring but can be bad for you taken out of context.\nYou really need control yourself when using rm. Especially if your backups are not current or you don’t have the time to do an erase / install / restore.\n\nDon't use rm\nImagine, you get used to rm moving to trash and make a habit of it. Sure, your system is safe but when you log into a friend's (or your wife's or your boss') notebook and have to delete something? You'll be actually using the real rm - deleting those files forever. Without lots of prep and qualifiers, it's a bad habit, and you need to know that.\nSo instead, install rmtrash and make a habit of using it:\n# install rmtrash, (either from the macports or by the brew.)\n$ alias trash=\"rmtrash\"\n$ alias   del=\"rmtrash\"       # del / trash are shorter than rmtrash\n\n\nCorrecting bad habits\nHere’s where the personal advice starts - changing one’s behavior is hard.\nAnother thing you can do to force yourself to use rmtrash instead of rm is alias it to a custom message in your .profile.\nalias rm=\"echo Use 'del', or the full path i.e. '/bin/rm'\"\n\nSo, whenever you use rm, you'll be prompted to either use rmtrash or /bin/rm. Remember, this is only temporary, after a while you should remove the alias.\n\nNever ever, do something like this:\n$ pwd\n/\n$ cd /tnp; rm -rf *\nsh: cd: /tnp: No such file or directory\n\nPop Quiz: In what directory will the rmcommand run? :)\n\nA: Introduction (you can skip it)\nFor me rm -i would be enough, because it prompts you before deleting any file. However, some extra security provided by safe-rm isn't a bad idea at all.\nA simple alias like rm=safe-rm -i could be enough, however rm -rf would not work, because -i is overriden by -f.\nSo, we have to make sure that -i always come after -f!\n\nMy solution (3 steps):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install safe-rm: brew install safe-rm\nYou can still work with rm, but you have modify the RM_BIN in the next step\n\n*Edit your ~/.profile (or bash_profile or whatever), and put the following code snippet, (which contain an alias and a function):\nalias rm=\"rm_i\"\n\nfunction rm_i(){\nRM_BIN=safe-rm # you can replace it with regular rm if you like\n\nargs=\"\"\nfiles=\"\"\nargsDone=0 # to make sure arguments are before the files\n\nfor var in \"$@\"\ndo\n    if [[ $var == \\-* ]] ; then\n        if [ $argsDone -eq 1 ] ; then\n            $RM_BIN # just to show the usage of rm\n            return\n        fi\n        args+=\" $var\"\n    else\n        argsDone=1\n        files+=\" $var\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nargs+=\" -i\" # Put -i at the end (so rm -rf will not ignore it)\n\n$RM_BIN $args $files\n}\n\n\n*Finally, logout and login, so the updates in the .profile are applied. DON'T use it before a logout/login!\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*It can be applied to any Linux distro, with slight modifications.\n\n*It does NOT move your staff to thrash. It just asks you before deleting each file!\n\n*It works with -rf and with regexes.\n\n*If you really want to use rm -rf WITHOUT being asked for every single file/folder you can still use /bin/rm -rf (or safe-rm -rf if you had installed it).\n\n*No more unintentional rm -rf or rm * ;)\n\n\nA: Mac bigSur\nbrew install trash\n\nalias rm='trash'\nwhich rm\n\ntouch a.md\nrm a.md\nls ~/.Trash\n\n", "Q: iMac external display blurry/fuzzy I've just got my new 2011 iMac (OS X 10.6.8), but connecting my HP LP2475w via a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable leads to a very fuzzy screen. It's the correct resolution and refresh rate (1920x1200, 60Hz), and size-wise, everything looks fine on the monitor. However, everything, especially the text, looks horribly blurry. It's almost as if the iMac is outputting a 1920x1199 image or something, and the display is stretching it slightly. Like what used to happen with old CRT monitors when you set the image 1px too tall/wide.\nHere's an image of what I see \n\nAnd here's how it should look\n\nDoes anyone know what the issue could be?\nThanks!\n\nA: [Edited - it looks like the original pictures are gone - some of this may not make the most sense without the original pictures - my apologies]\nAwesome screen shot - that shows the software settings are perfect. You can be sure of that by opening the System Profiler app and looking at the Graphics / Displays data when the external is connected.\nYour screen shot is nearly identical to mine - I am not using LCD font smoothing and the slight difference in color values could easily be color calibration differences. The pixels two above and two below the one selected are one or two darker on my display as compared to your screenshot.\nHere is a magnification of both - mine on the bottom and your picture on the top.\n\n\nEven though it's unlikely - I would make sure it's not a timing issue by the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*disconnect the cable, adapter and power off the monitor\n\n*power on the external monitor\n\n*connect the cables and adapter to the monitor\n\n*plug in the whole works to the mac\n\n\nSometimes when a mac wakes from sleep, you get snow or other artifacts on rare occasion if the mac detects the monitor capabilities from the adapter and sends signal before the monitor can react (or is still scanning other ports if it's got multiple inputs).\nNow - the real cause is likely cabling / adapter / monitor. You'll have to test that by eliminating / borrowing / replacing them one by one. :-( Either that or some bizarre software driver issue. That also will be a tough one to pin down unless it's a popular monitor and you just updated software.\nDid this display ever work well for you with your mac?\nDoes the pixelated font rendering move or os it perfectly static and repeatable each time the menu is drawn?\nI have seen electrical noise cause that - bad shielding or cables/connectors or more likely noise on the ac power from a large motor or wiring issues.\nThis is a real stumper since it happening on multiple macs and multiple monitors. \n\nA: You're not connecting with a VGA cable, are you? Mini Display Port to VGA adapter to VGA-in on the monitor? Because if so, it might very well BE approximating the resolution to an actual X-by-Y that isn't a native multiple of the screen pixels.\nThe giveaway about that is regular vertical stripes of fuzziness. Not the only giveaway, but if you have blurry streaks, you need a DVI cable.\nEDIT: Reading your comments on the question, I'm now certain. Using DVI will solve this. \n", "Q: how to stop spotlight indexing an attached camera When I attach my video camera (for the purpose of importing some clips into FCP-X) I noticed that spotlight is indexing the camera (which does show up as an external disk when I connect it, via the USB cable)  I'm pretty sure that there is some contention between spotlight trying to index these files and FCPX trying to import them.

How can I fix this?\n\nA: The problem is because analogue (VGA) connection is used and the \"auto\" positioning does not detect the image bounds correctly. Check your monitor controls (menu) and move the image left/right and up/down (usually labeled HPOS/VPOS). Here are my recommendations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the native resolution (1440 x 900) and 60 Hz refresh rate.\n\n*If still not centered, use the monitor's controls to position the image.\n\n*If this does not work - try lowering the resolution or changing the refresh rate and again centering the image.\n\n\nA: If by \"delay\" you mean offset (delay relates specifically to time in English) then that is easily changed. You change the relationships between monitors by going to System Preferences and choosing Displays. Click on the Arrangement tab. That tab will allow you to change how  monitors are relatively positioned \"virtually\" by dragging them.\n", "Q: full wireless keyboard for iMac \nPossible Duplicate:\nfull wireless keyboard for iMac \n\nAre you aware of any full (with numpad, apple keys, preferably german layout) wireless keyboard that works well with the (latest gen) iMac and resembles the iMac design.\nI am not asking for shopping suggestions.

I have recently purchased a Macbook Pro and I am very impressed with the machine and OS X. Coming from Windows the one thing I have struggled with is the file system and the Finder application. I suppose I am very used to drag and drop of files in Windows Explorer. As a aspiring Mac developer, should I ditch Finder altogether and use the Terminal only?\nAlso, whenever I am trying to decide where to put a document or file I wonder what all the directories in the UNIX file system are for and where files should go, and I end up just putting it somewhere and it seems to be a real mess now :). \nDo you know of any resources/ tutorials that would be of any help?\n\nA: In windows you got:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop, and\n\n*My Documents\n\n\nOn OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*You got $HOME folder ( represented as ~ which also comes from OSX's unix heritage) . Here is the usual and expected place for user files. Your Documents, Music, Downloads as well as the Desktop folders all live in your home folder. \n\n\nSo, everything, what is YOURS put into $HOME folder somewhere. Make your own hierarchy if the default one is unpleasant or unuseful. \n\n\n*\n\n*Music, Movies, Pictures are - as in windows\n\n*Public - your own Shared folder\n\n*Documents - for your documents\n\n*of course, you can make any number of sub-folders in your HOME.\n\n\nApplications belong in /Applications or ~/Applications folder. You can put them in the another place too and OSX will find and run applications no matter where they are stored. You can make hierarchy here too, as I told once in my older post.\nOne more thing - Fonts, you can put fonts into $HOME/Library/Fonts, or into /Library/Fonts (for all users)\nFor the start, this is enough. Don't touch other folders yet (you don't need). If something needs to be used by multiple users on the same Mac, generally store it in /Users/Shared or change the permissions in the alternate place you store them. \nfor the common unix standard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard\n\nA: Welcome, Martijn.\nI always recommend Apple's videos: http://support.apple.com/videos/#macos\nFor now I would also recommend you not worry about terminal/UNIX.  Learn to use the Mac OS using the GUI at first, getting used to how it behaves and in which ways it might be different from the Windows operating systems you are used to.\nGood luck!\nEDIT: Also, it doesn't really matter where things \"should\" go on a Mac.  You can put applications on the desktop, documents in Applications, etc, etc.  Although I don't recommend that.  There is a Documents folder for documents and an Applications folder for apps.  Treat the Library and System folders with care (IE -- do not go into them or manipulate them until/unless you know what they are, what's inside and what the effect of your actions will be) and you will be fine.  Backups are also your best friend.\n\nA: I've been through the same situation you are dealing with. The OS X finder is incomplete in some odd and irritating ways.\nFortunately, there are some add-ons to make the two platforms more similar, and add additional functionality to Finder.\n\n\n*\n\n*TotalFinder is excellent. It adds the ability to Cut and Paste files, sort folders separately from files (essential, at least for me), redirects the annoying .ds_store files so if you have \"show hidden files\" on, they don't show up everywhere.\nIt also supports a dual-pane \"Total-Commander\" style view, for moving files from one directory to another.\nIt has an unlimited free trial. Apparently registering is a feel-good thing, mostly. The only penalty for not registering is a \"Unregistered Copy\" note in the title-bar of the window.\n\n*Witch Makes alt-tab actually useful. It basically lets you alt-tab (or \"Command\"-Tab, if you will) between windows, not applications. Not free, unfortunately.\n\n*If you don't want to use TotalFinder, there is FinderPath, which adds a real, editable path bar to finder windows. The lack of a real path bar is one of the longest-standing, stupidest oversights in OS X's Finder.\n\n*HyperDock is also nice, if you are not on a recent MacBook with multiple graphics cards. It adds Windows Aero-style window previews to the Dock. If you run apps with lots of open windows, it is pretty much indispensable.\nUnfortunately, it causes the Multiple-GPU MacBooks to switch from the Integrated IGP to the Discrete IGP whenever the previews are enabled (note: not only when used), even if you never trigger them to be shown.\n\nRegarding directories,\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows: C:/Users/*username*/AppData/\n\n*OS X: /Users/*username*/Library/\n\n*Windows: C:/Program Files/\n\n*OS X: /Applications/\n\n*OS X: When you install developer tools, they get placed in: /Developer\nSpecifically, the XCode Binaries gets placed in /Developer/Applications\n\nA: Drag and drop works in Finder, although it is only possible to copy files using drag and drop.\nTo Copy and Paste files, use Cmd-C, open the destination, Cmd-V. **\nTo \"Cut and Paste\"  (or move) files, use Cmd-C (NB: not Cmd-X), open the destination, Cmd-Alt-V.\nTo type in a path, press Cmd-Shift-G, or in the Menu bar Go -> Go To Folder... (2nd last item)\nTo \"Alt-Tab\" between windows doesn't really exist on Mac, but there are alternatives: \n\n\n*\n\n*Exposé: If you want to switch windows within an Application, you can use Exposé, \n\n\n*\n\n*To activate it on the active application swipe down on the Touch Pad (if you're on a Macbook) with four fingers.\n\n*To activate it for any open app, move the cursor to the icon on the dock, and then double tap (NB: not click) with two fingers on the touch pad.\n\n\n*Your can open Mission Control, four finger swipe up on touch pad, this gives you an overview of all open windows grouped in apps.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can zoom in on an apps windows in Mission Control by hovering over the stack of it's windows and swiping/scrolling up with two fingers.\n\n*You can zoom in on a specific window by hovering over the window (whether you've done the bullet point directly above, or not) and pressing the space bar.\n** (many shortcuts on Mac are the same as Windows, except often Ctrl is replaced with Cmd)\n\nA: Drag and drop works in Finder - what problem are you having with it?  You can drag a (or several) file(s) to a new location to move them there (if source and destination are on the same volume) or copy them (if source and destination are different).  Even without TotalFinder (excellent enhancement: provides dual-pane and tabbed interface to Finder - reccommended), you can open two finder windows (Cmd-N opens the new one) to the source and destination, respectively); or use the \"spring-loaded folders\" feature that opens each folder you drag/hover over, revealing the folders inside.  To use it, open Finder's preferences (Cmd-,) and make sure \"Spring-loaded folders\" is checked.\n\nA: Personally, I would ditch finder altogether.\nIt is not an accurate representation of the file system, and gets VERY confusing.\nThe command line can be daunting at first, but if you keep working with it, you will have much better control over your machine.\n", "Q: Is there a real alternative on the Mac to Ctrl+Alt+Delete (not the \"force quit\" dialog)?

I have installed a new XCode 4 on a machine and I'd like to copy/paste the syntax coloring settings from the first one to the new one.

Now themes are bundled inside of the Xcode application's bundle at following path:\nXcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/FontAndColorThemes\n\nAlso Xcode8 theme has extension xccolortheme while Xcode7.3 has dvtcolortheme. From my experience - it's safe change the extension without modifying the file itself.\n\nA: As of Xcode Version 11.6 (11E708), the file extension for color themes is xccolortheme.\nThe path to the included themes is:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTUserInterfaceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/FontAndColorThemes\n\n\nThe path to a user's custom themes is the same as in the accepted answer:\n~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/\n\n\nTo install a custom theme, you can simply drag the xccolortheme file into the folder for custom themes; quit Xcode, then restart Xcode. The theme will now appear in Xcode's Preferences for Fonts & Colors.\n\nA: With Themeinstaller, you can just open .dvtcolortheme files and they will be installed in your Xcode folder.\nIn case you wanted some new themes there are many to be found on codethemes.net, having Themeinstaller, you can install them, just by clicking \"install\" under any of your choice.\n", "Q: Can I have two mac users share one iTunes library on the same mac? I have my iTunes library that lives under my account.  There's about 20 Gigs of music and I sync the music to my own iPod.\nMy wife now has her own iPod.  She wants to log in under her own account, see the iTunes library and customize it for herself; for example, make her own playlists, set her own star ratings to her favorite songs, and so on.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: It is a tiny bit ugly - but there are formal steps to accomplish exactly what you wish. Home Sharing doesn't work so well when both accounts have completely separate libraries - each in the usual home folder - so that's not a good thing to try.\nThe best workaround is to agree to store the media in a shared folder. It's more work to add the same music to both libraries - but you both have totally independent backups, playlists, play counts, ratings and apps.\nThis works really well and you can easily recombine later or split her or your account to another mac or PC any time you choose by taking a copy of the reference files as well as the library organization files.\n", "Q: Preventing iTunes from keeping old versions on \"Mobile Applications\" folder I just manually deleted about 1gb of useless old version files from that folder.

Why are they kept there in the first place?\n\nA: I don't know an easy solution to change iTunes, but I do have a cleaner library by letting go. It's not exactly what you ask, but here goes anyhow.\nI did one good backup of my user folder and then deleted all apps from within iTunes. Then I cleared out the folders to remove any left over / orphan app files.\nThen I connected my devices one by one and just transferred the purchases. Less updates of un-needed apps and less space used.\nI suppose they could pull an app from sale and I might miss out on some updates, but I'm willing to take that risk. I've still got the last version I wasn't using stored on my backup.\n\nA: Here's how I did it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your iTunes library in case this goes wrong. ;)\n\n*Move all app files from \"Mobile Applications\" to the Desktop.\n\n*Remove all apps from the iTunes library, but pick \"Keep Files\".\n\n*(Temporarily) enable \"Copy files to iTunes Media Folder when adding to library.\" in the iTunes preferences.\n\n*Drag the app files from your Desktop into iTunes.\n\n*Unfortunately, iTunes will prompt you when it finds duplicates. But  \"Don't Replace\" or \"Replace\" is preselected correctly based on which version is newer. So you can just hold the Return key down through the process.\n\n\nThe downside is: all apps are considered new now. So maybe disable \"Automatically sync new apps\" in the device sync screen before syncing.\n", "Q: Auto batch-insert track numbers in iTunes? I recently imported a whole bunch of MP3s that I've already grouped into a single album, but the ID3 tags for track numbers are all blank. How can I tell iTunes to auto-add track numbers in the order they just happen to be in in iTunes? The actual order of the MP3s isn't essential, but I like to keep every MP3 in my library properly labelled.\n\nA: iTunes doesn't offer this functionality natively: Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes always comes in handy in these situations. In this case, however, there's no easy solution, because there is no script that does that. You would need a combination of three scripts, which should work and should be fairly easy as soon as you have installed all three of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Number Song Names by Play Order and run it on the tracks you would like to number. This will add track numbers to the beginning of the track name.\n\n*Run Put Track Prefix to Track Numbers on the tracks, which will set the track tags based on the number you've added in step 1.\n\n*Use Remove n Characters From Front or Back to remove the track numbers added to the name.\n\n\nAs far as I can tell this is the easiest way to accomplish that. Of course you could also write your own AppleScript which does it in one step. And don't forget to create a backup, just in case.\n\nA: A script to increment the track numbers in the order in which they appear is now available at Doug's Apple Scripts.

My video editing needs are very, very pedestrian and seldom. I have no real need for Final Cut Pro.\nWhen I do make videos, however, I like to customize titles a bit more than what iMovie allows. So Motion 5's relatively low price caught my eye immediately.\nI know that Motion's main strength is putting together parameterized effect packages that can be exported to and used wholly within FCPX. But if its standalone functionality is full-featured and relatively hassle-free, it might be worth it.\nSo; advice?\n\nA: It really all depends on how much patience you have.  Using Motion as a stand alone editor is possible, but it is an incredible hassle.  For example, cutting film into different pieces puts those different pieces into different layers.  Sometimes it detaches the audio, which then means you have to do audio syncing.  Plus, if the project is a long one, your machine might start to choke on it.  I wouldn't recommend Motion as a stand alone editor.\nBut, that being said, I'd still recommend Motion for what you're talking about.  I think it is stand alone enough to do what you want, all you really need to do is get used to round tripping between iMovie and Motion.  To do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cut your movie in iMovie\n\n*Export it and import it into Motion\n\n*Find the part that you wanted to put titling on and use \"split\" to separate it from the rest of your movie.\n\n*Delete the part you don't need.\n\n*After you done using Motion, export the movie and import it back into iMovie.\n\n*Just put it into the place it had been before...\n\n\nI really like Motion myself (use it all the time), and it certainly can add that extra zing to your movies.\nOne more piece of advice, go find the Apple Training for Motion 4 by Mark Spencer.  Great book, easy to use and gets you up to speed really fast.  Yeah, I know, it's for the old version, but Motion 5 is literally the same thing as Motion 4 with the addition of rigging.  And if you're not using FCPX you don't need rigging.  So, go get the book :-).\n", "Q: Numbers: hotkeys to choose cells in formula edit mode When I edit formulae in Numbers, is it possible to select nearby cells using the cursor keys?\nFor example, I might be editing cell C3, and set its formula to \"=B2+C2\".

You could probably hack together some good org-mode stuff in that. It is written by the same person that wrote Pythonista mentioned in the blog post above. \nPersonally I find myself using Drafts, Byword and Editorial for different purposes and all three have no problem with Dropbox.\n\nA: Here's a nice iPhone Text Editors comparison by the great Michael Tsai (author of SpamSieve among others).\nComparing iPhone Text Editors, v4.

Now I would like to reinstall, but I cannot find a way. The 10.6.6 combo updater of course will not do the job because it needs an older OS X incarnation and I'm running 10.6.8.\n\nA: Download and re-install the Mac OS X 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1.\nat the link above.\n\nA: This guy extracted the App http://www.qubesys.com/reinstall-mac-app-store/\n\nA: If you don't want to trust an Internet version of the app, you can always reinstall from your Snow Leopard disc / restore media and run the combo updater of your choice. Any combo updater 10.6.6, 10.6.7 or 10.6.8 will have the App Store on it.\nAlso, your backup should have a copy of the app.\n\nA: The issue with downloading the app that someone has extracted is that it is coded with his Apple ID.  At this time I am unable to change the ID in the program to allow me to use it.  Better choice is to go with re-installing the update.\n", "Q: Why doesn't anything happen when I connect my Nexus S to a MacBook Pro 2010 using a USB cable? I've tried to connect a Nexus S to a MBP 2010 via USB. After connection, the Mac does not respond.\nAnybody know why? I have tried it with a powered USB hub and get the same result: No responses for the USB storage.\n\nA: Fire up system profiler on your mac. This can be refreshed to show all USB devices connected - even if there is a driver issue, at least you'll know if the cable and physical connection are good.\n\nA: And finally I have found this issue is caused by a bad USB cable.\nIt is working when I use a HTC USB cable to connect to my MBP.  \n\nA: You may need to download software provided by Samsung to connect your device by USB.\n", "Q: Migrating iTunes library when replacing the hard disk I am replacing my Macbook's hard disk and I have already a copy of all files I want to transfer over except for my iTunes library.\nSince I sync my iPad with it, and have some apps, what is the best approach to backup and migrate my iTunes library to the new disk? \nI don't have a 2nd computer, so I can't use the migration assistant.\n\nA: The simple answer is iTunes has really only stores two types of data:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS backups\n\n*playlists, ratings, music, books, apps, movies, etc...\nIf you don't just want to plug in your iPad and other iOS devices and transfer purchases, then you'll want a $8 drive connector to connect your old drive as an external to bring over the media, the backups or both. Yu can also get these files from time machine or other backup (offsite or local)\nEven after swapping the old drive, you can still start iTunes pointing to the old backup library and run / restore or export parts of the library playlists and move over just part of your library. \nIt really depends on what exactly your setup involves (sync data over USB like calendars or photos) may require you to migrate some other data or watch/control the first sync to ensure your iPad doesn't lose unintended data.\n\nA: A regular iTunes sync will not copy your music from your device to your Mac's new HD.  So you want to make a separate backup of your iTunes library to an external HD or flash drive.\n\nA: If you have an external storage device with enough free space, all you need to do is copy your iTunes folders from home/music/iTunes and home/library/iTunes and replace those folders on the new drive. \nAfter that, when you open iTunes, everything will be as it was on your original hard drive.\nIf you haven't got an external HD with enough free space, you can connect your original HD through a caddy, and transfer the files like that! You can buy caddy's from various retailers, I'm not sure where you are based but you can get an idea here \nhttp://www.google.co.uk/products/catalog?client=safari&rls=en&q=disk+caddy&oe=UTF-8&redir_esc=&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=9272701352248655613&sa=X&ei=2qElTqChNs-XhQed2KyBCg&ved=0CGMQ8gIwAw\nMake sure you get a 2.5\" SATA Caddy/Enclosure for a laptop HD or a 3.5\" for a desktop!\n(I'm assuming you're using a mac here, in regards to the file paths, not too sure what they would be on a windows machine, but shouldn't be too different!)\n", "Q: Windows 7 on 2011 MBP's internal HDD, OS X on FW800 one I'm about to get my new 2011 MBP next week and it's coming with a 256gb internal SSD, but I was wondering if it's possible to use the disk entirely for Windows 7 (bootcamp'ed) & install Mac OS X on an external FW800 drive 'only'? Is this doable or are there any restrictions or limitations that require Mac OS X to be installed on the internal hdd? Basically my main work environment is Windows 7 but I need Mac OS X for other, fewer contracts aswell.\n\nA: There is no reason why you can't do this up to and including Mac OS X 10.6.8 version of Boot Camp.\nDo test command line booting control if you care about those things - but currently there is no restriction other than the Boot Camp volume must be on the internal drive.

I know it’s important to leave it alone.  I have, in fact, done exactly that. ☺ \n\nBackground\nThe Python official releases for Mac have a very handy Installer.  (It’s the Installer’s brilliance that allowed me to put newer versions of Python on my system without screwing up the system-bundled version.  Thanks, Pythonistas!)  \nNow, my primary Python installation is 2.7.  Since it is the last 2.x release, that’s fine.\nHowever, I was curious to learn about Python 3 as well, so I installed it.  And it plays perfectly nicely with Python 2.  In fact, Python 3 is opt-in, which is just what I wanted.  “Works as advertised.”\nNow, the weird part…\nI have 2 installed versions of Python 3!  The installers for Python 3.1 and Python 3.2 both installed to separate locations.  So, now I have Python 3.1 hanging around and I’m never planning to use it.  And since the installer is awesome (I’m not being sarcastic; I’m really impressed, especially since most programming languages require compilation from source), it also creates entries in /Applications with some handy utilities.  \nBut since I have installed a newer Python 2 and two versions of Python 3, this means I now have:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications/Python 2.7,\n\n*/Applications/Python 3.1, and \n\n*/Applications/Python 3.2\nHelp Wanted!\nI just want to ditch Python 3.1.  \nAnd I want to be very thorough about it.  No forgotten directories buried under /Library/* (or whatever).  \nAnybody know how to do this?\n\nA: From python docs noting that they seem to have hard coded 2.5 instead of the current version and is not that well written\n\nWhat you get after installing is a number of things:\n\n\nA MacPython 2.5 folder in your Applications folder. In here you find\nIDLE, the development environment that is a standard part of official\nPython distributions; PythonLauncher, which handles double-clicking\nPython scripts from the Finder; and the “Build Applet” tool, which\nallows you to package Python scripts as standalone applications on\nyour system.\n\n\nA framework /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework, which\nincludes the Python executable and libraries. The installer adds this\nlocation to your shell path. To uninstall MacPython, you can simply\nremove these three things. A symlink to the Python executable is\nplaced in /usr/local/bin/.\n\nso remove\n/Applications/Python 3.1\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1\n/usr/local/bin/python31 \n\n(I use a different install so this might be python3.1 or similar)\n", "Q: What are the consequences of jailbreaking an iOS device as a Developer? What would be the consequences of Jailbreaking my iOS device as a developer? \nWhat are some of the benefits, and what are some of the issues with Jailbreaking as a developer? \nHow would this effect Xcode when \"paired\" with my iPod?\n\nA: Consequences: \n\n\n*\n\n*increased personal responsibility to not install software or firmware that might prevent restoration to a supported configuration.\n\n*increased personal responsibility for device instability or security vulnerabilities\n\n*less software support from the vendor (may be moot if you run beta software as there is less support for that as well)\n\n*potential delay if you ask for a hardware repair (either within or without the warranty period) if you do something that prevents a factory restore I suppose you might be out of luck, but I consider that further action (or error) past a jailbreak. \n\n*reduced confidence that the app will be of use in debugging issues \n\n*having to determine if an issue is in all devices or just in jailbroken devices (such as frequent and intermittent issues with push notification service).\n\n\nI have had hardware exchanged by Apple when running beta software - the technician was able to tell it was clearly a hardware error and I was open with her when I presented the device for service. I wasn't made to feel like I had done anything wrong. You could be denied service if you're running software not designed by the manufacturer, I think a little common sense will let you know if it's worth the risk.\nI see jailbreaking as taking down a guardrail. If you crash and the \"authorities\" rule you would have been safe had you left up the protection, you've got less grounds to stand on. From the comments on another answer - a several people disagree with this (and that's better than fine, many viewpoints is a strength here)\nOn the plus side, if you know what you are doing, you might be able to patch known vulnerabilities better than or faster than Apple does. You might also gain knowledge you would not in the process of jailbreaking and dealing with the device while the guardrail is down.\nBut to gloss over the difference between hardware support and software support or just stating \"jailbreak=bad\" over simplifies a complex issue in my eyes.\n\nA: If you are developing App store apps, you will now be testing on a device configuration different from the vast majority (90%+) of your customer base.  You may also not always be able to update your device OS as quickly as your customer base responds to Apple OS updates.  So you might want to make sure you always have at least one device available to run the stock OS for app testing purposes.\nModified OSes may have a different set of security vulnerabilities from the stock OS.  So you may want to learn about and take additional precautions to make sure your developer or iTunes account credentials don't get stolen off of the device.\n\nA: Benefits:\nYou can develop on your iDevice. You can install emacs and vi and python and PHP and lisp and perl and whatever else you want.\n\nA: Consequences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Apple warranty becomes voided.\n\n*Possible inconstancies in terms of RAM usage - may make memory management difficult when using Instruments\n\n*Unexpected iOS behavior\n\n\nXcode would behave as normal.\n", "Q: What are the best programs for editing midi files? I'm looking for a Mac OS X program for editing midi files. \nSpecifically, I'm using the program Synthesia to learn how to play songs on the piano, but a lot of the midi files I have don't have the notes split into a right hand and left hand track. I'm looking for a program where I can load one of these midi files, add a new track, and then manually move notes from the existing track onto the new track.\nAre there any good programs I can do this with?\n\nA: I'll admit I'm biased because I've been working with it for years now, but Apple's Logic has one of the best MIDI editing interfaces going. If the Pro version is a little too much for you to stomach there's an \"Express\" version that's pared down when it comes to plugins and samples, but has the same excellent MIDI editor.\nOn the cheap-but-effective side you've got Reaper which will run on OS X and includes MIDI editing facilities. You can try it out for free and it's $40 (at the time of writing) to buy it if you like it. Hard to beat that deal.\nAnd then in between these two running the gamut of price and features you've got a whole slew of other options: Cubase, Sonar, Abelton, etc. Each of them offering slightly (or not so slightly) different interfaces and feature sets.\n\nA: I had this same problem, and I've just discovered that you can actually do it in Synthesia. Just do this....\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the song\n\n*Click on 'Hands Colours and Instruments' button\n\n*Click where it currently says Left Hand, Right Hand or Background and choose  the 'custom' option\n\n*Click on 'Split from here' at the top\n\n*Click where you want to split left/right and then click on continue. It will split all of the future notes left/right from where you click. So you can then progress through the song and click higher or lower on the keyboard as needed.\n\n*To fine tune any notes that you want to change click on each notes with the left or right mouse button to assign it to the left or right hand\n\n\nA: Coming from someone who has been involved with MIDI from the day it all started back around the mid 80's the two oldest programs that still have the best feature set and simplistic approach to MIDI and MIDI editing are Cubase and Cakewalk (which is now called Sonar). Cubase was developed by Steinberg in Germany, and Cakewalk was developed by 12 Tone Systems in the US.\nThese programs were all developed using actual musicians for musicians to produce songs using MIDI equipment. Over the years many other companies have entered the market and developed some tools that allow a non musician to have a hand in creating music that the computer could generate using processes that automatically create a musical phrase. These phrases can then be compiled into a song that a person can utilise as a complete composition. Most of these products create a song that is highly recognised as Elevator or Weather Channel music. It is very repetitive and always uses sounds that are very sterile and lifeless.\nThis method has allowed the developers to get a larger market share in the way of sales but has not contributed much to the musician because the tools needed to create a song are mostly in the hands of a skilled musician and not a novice hobbyist.\nThere have been a few new developers that have entered the marketplace but on a more serious level such as Pro-Tools and Nuendo but at a much higher cost due to them using proprietary hardware. This software has married MIDI & AUDIO in one common objective and that is to utilise all the methods of creating & recording sound into one solution.\nMost of the computer related music has been generated using an IBM PC when MIDI was first released and Apple started a bit later but with only one program which started on the PC platform but later moved to Apple which is called Logic. Around 1993 Pro-Tools was a company that was originally designed to record audio on an Apple platform added MIDI to it's software for expanded capabilities of the new samplers that were also entering the production marketplace. MIDI was staring to find it's way into big film production by artists such as Hans Zimmer whereby the entire film was synchronised using MIDI to trigger all the sound effects and music simultaneously.\nA more recent player has come on to the Apple side called Garage Band which has also employed MIDI to access the various Virtual Instruments that come standard with Garage Band. \nAs you can see there are a lot of programs that utilise MIDI to create music but each person must sort through where their priorities are and buy accordingly. It is also important to stay with your purchase so you can become proficient with your software. If you keep trying different software expecting it to be easier to use then you will never learn to be proficient with any of the packages out there.\nLastly, it matters not what platform you are on as the end results are all the same be it a PC or an Apple computer.\nHave Fun!\n\nA: Note (hah) that Garageband comes with a pianoroll midi editor, for free, already installed. You could duplicate your track and delete the unwanted hand from each.\n", "Q: How can I downgrade apps from the Cydia Store? Is it possible to downgrade apps you have upgraded in the Cydia Store? (Jailbroken) If so how would you do it?\n\nA: The only way (as far as I know having experience with Cydia repos) is to find a respiratory with the older version as when you push an update to Cydia you take out the original.\nI'm sure if you run a quick google search for the version of whichever Cydia app (.deb) you are looking for you'll be able to find it.\n", "Q: What are the consequences of upgrading to OS X 10.7 Lion if I have a separate Boot Drive and Home folder drive in my MacBook Pro? I have an early-2011 MacBook Pro 15\" with a 128GB SSD. I replaced the built-in SuperDrive with a 750GB MCE OptiBay HD, so my boot drive is the 128GB SSD (speed!) and I have moved over most of my Home folder except for Applications and Library to the 750GB HD (storage!). To make it all work smoothly, I followed TUAW's advice found here.\nMy directory structure looks like:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSD (Boot)\n\n*\n\n*Applications\n\n*Developer\n\n*Library\n\n*opt\n\n*System\n\n*Users\n\n\n*HD (Storage)\n\n*\n\n*Desktop\n\n*Documents\n\n*Downloads\n\n*Dropbox\n\n*Library (the other one)\n\n*Movies\n\n*Music\n\n*Pictures\n\n*Public\n\n*Sites\n\n\n\nSo, my concern is that upgrading to Lion will eradicate this structure in some way and that I will have to do a special install. Has anyone tried this yet and can you tell me if there are any pitfalls I need to be aware of?\n\nA: You probably should do what BMike has said as a precaution, but what you could also do is create alias folders in the Empty Users Home folder on the SSD. The alias folders would be empty, but would link to the actual folder on the larger hard drive. To create the alias, drag the actual folder to the users folder on the SSD whilst pressing command and alt together, you will see the green plus sign on the folder turn to a little curved arrow, whilst you're dragging.\nAnything you put into the alias folders will go in the corresponding folder on the larger HD! This should also prevent any issues with the Lion upgrade, however in saying that, you shouldn't have a problem anyway as all the OS files are on the SSD!\nHope this helps!\n\nA: So, here is what I have done, and so far there have been no ill effects:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase Lion from the Mac App Store so that the installer is in the Applications folder before step 2...\n\n*Download and register SuperDuper! and create clones of the boot and storage drives (since the Lion installer is on the boot drive, any restores will restore the Lion installer, preventing you from having to redownload it)\n\n*Confirm that the boot drive clone boots properly, and that it still sees the original home folder (set up using the TUAW instructions mentioned in my original question).\n\n*Run the Lion installer.\n\n\nIt was that simple. Lion installed over the Snow Leopard installation with no apparent issues. \nThe only \"sort of\" issue I have encountered (and it is not directly related to the OP) is that after installing Lion, I enabled FileVault. Since the boot drive is separate from the storage drive, and FV only works on the boot drive, I think this creates some sort of permissions issue when trying to access the storage drive, such that I was prompted for my password when performing many file actions (moves and deletes primarily). The biggest issue here is that anything that used Dropbox (on the storage drive) to sync, such as 1Password and TextExpander, was giving me permission errors and was not working properly. TextExpander lost the ability to use the Dropbox sync feature, and 1Password was throwing a strange sync error. \nThis did not happen prior to activating FV. Since the sensitive information is on the storage drive anyway, and nothing of any real value is on the boot drive, FV doesn't have a huge benefit to me, so I simply disabled it and everything seems to be working fine. I am currently investigating 3rd party encryption tools to replace FileVault.\nI also had issues with Login items not staying put in the Pref Pane dialog (under Users & Groups), but disabling FV corrected that as well. \n", "Q: Can you change an MOV to an MP4 without transcoding? How can change video container from .mov to .mp4 without touching the video itself? Preferably a GUI app.\nI have a bunch of videos in .mov and since .mp4 is more widespread I want to use that, but I don't want to lose any quality.\n\nA: You could do that with ffmpeg:\nffmpeg -i video.mov -vcodec copy -acodec copy video.mp4\n\nThis will just change containers, but obviously will only work with a codec that ffmpeg supports.\nEdit: if you absolutely need a GUI, you could use Automator to create a Drag & Drop target, like this:\n\n\nA: QuickTime 7 Pro.\nAgain, only if it is in a codec allowed for MP4s.\n\nA: It is also known as rewrapping. \nOpen the file with MPEG Streamclip (freeware, adware-free) and choose File > Save As…, then choose the format: MP4. \n", "Q: How can I create iPhone screenshots without the lock button? Is there any way to create a screenshot of an iPhone without using the combination home+lock button? Is there an app for jailbroken phones? Something else?\nI do not have a Mac; only Windows.\n\nA: Yes, there is. After you have jailbroken, install Activator. In there you can assign another activation method for taking a screen shot. Good luck!\n\nA: I just found out the solution: go to the Activator app, click on a gesture you want to use, keep scrolling down until you find \"Take A Screenshot\". Mine is now set up to where I can push both volume buttons simultaneously and bam, screen shot captured!\n\nA: Go to settings>General>Accessibility>Scroll down>AssistiveTouch\nTurn it on.\nThen you just click the home button and it gives you the option of screenshot if you do this:\nClick device>More>Screenshot and you are done! \n\nA: An alternative would be to simply take a picture of the screen with a camera.\n\nA: I'm sure there is not another way to do screenshots.\n", "Q: How can I open port 443 in Mac OS X 10.6?

If I use the my laptop while my hands are (very) wet, will the water get into the insides of the computer through the gaps at the side of the trackpad?\n\nA: Yes - capillary action is strongest in small gaps like the one surrounding the glass trackpad and the unibody frame. That liquid would likely seep and pool on top of the battery.\n", "Q: What are some steps to troubleshoot problems sharing printers, files, and screen? I am having many problems sharing (printer, file, screen) from a Macbook Pro (10.6.8) to a PowerMac G5 tower (10.5.8). It was working just fine until we switched internet providers and got a new router. I have checked IP addresses, etc. \nWhat are some general troubleshooting steps I can take to determine where the problem might lie?\n\nA: Please be more specific.  If nothing changed except for the router, though, let me ask: is the one machine plugged in directly to the network via Ethernet, and is the other accessing the network through WiFi?\nIf so, it may be that the router has a feature enabled called \"WAP Isolation\" -- basically it creates a separate network segment (or collision domain, if you like) for the wireless clients.  Try disabling wireless with the laptop and plug it in directly.  If it works, that's probably where the problem is.\n\nA: Absolutely. The best step would be to connect the two macs with an Ethernet cable.\nYou don't need a crossover cable - just any patch cable. \nIf the problem is software, it won't work when connected directly. \nYou will want to rule out the router as potential for causing the issue. \n\nA: I did figure out the problem; my router had MAC address filtering on. So, I turned off the MAC address filtering and it works now.\n", "Q: How can I capture video of my iPad, while making touches visible?

Are there any Mac tools for checking pdf and image files for encapsulated malware, exploits, or other potentially suspicious stuff?\nIf I email these files to myself on some online account, which online email services (gmail? yahoo? mobileme? et.al.) might do a decent job of scanning these items for me?\n\nA: If you’re looking to check on a system-wide level, then the Server tools that bmike mentioned above might be of more use to you. I don’t have experience with them; I’m recommending two tools that are useful for an individual user.\n\n\n*\n\n*ClamXav (free, http://www.clamxav.com/) is based on the ClamAV engine that bmike mentioned. It can be told to scan everything on your hard drive, or just files you tell it to (e.g. only files downloaded from the web). Specific to your needs, from their home page: “Clearly lists infected files”. I presume, but am not certain, that such files include PDF and image files.\n\n*Virusbarrier ($49.95, www.intego.com/virusbarrier/) and VirusBarrier Plus (99¢, Mac App Store) are both made by Intego. The MAS page claims that this “Finds and repairs Microsoft Word, Excel or PowerPoint documents” and “Finds and eradicates PDF malware”, which seems what you’re looking for. I tried VirusBarrier a couple of years ago, and it seemed pretty decent, but I stopped using it because it was overkill for my purposes.\nOne of those two might be able to sort you out. Note that they both go after Windows and Mac malware, so you needn’t worry about sending on malware to a Windows PC if you use one of the above (in theory, at least).\nIf you’re interested, you might also like to look up XProtect. It’s an anti-malware system built into OS X, that looks out for nasty things. It’s not as mature as the two products above (it debuted in mid-2009, IIRC), but it’s a nice tool to have, nonetheless.\n\nAs for some of the online services you mentioned, I’ve found various pages from the companies about their policy on scanning email. I’ve never run into any of these antivirus scanners, so I can’t comment on their quality.\nGoogle has an antivirus scanner in Gmail, as explained on this Gmail support page:\n\nGmail automatically scans every attachment when it's delivered to you, and again each time you open a message. Attachments you send are also scanned. Checking attachments for viruses protects our users and their information, and prevents the spread of viruses.\n\nSimilarly, Yahoo! scan and clean all of your attachments:\n\nYahoo!

(i.e., does sleep unmount drives?) Is it safe to unplug a drive while MacBook is asleep? (i.e., does sleep unmount drives?)\nI think probably not, at least if a file operation was running when you put the computer to sleep, I guess it expects the drive to be mounted when it wakes up. Does it?\n\nA: No. Logging out dismounts the drives. \nUSB changes will wake most macs from sleep assuring an uncontrolled unmount should users be logged in. The file systems should be clean and synced when entering sleep, but there is no guarantee of it. \nFirewire drives also could be corrupted in a similar fashion. \nWith journaled filesystems you'll likely only lose a few files, but it's not the best practice. Plugging things in as fast as possible is the best option in case you can get things back before the system wakes.\n", "Q: How do I control text alignment in a document with a  3 column layout in Pages 09? How do I create a menu/brochure for a salon with 3 columns, where the price will be next to the description but right-aligned?\nI think there has to be be a better way than hitting the Space bar to get it to the right!\n\nA: If you've got tabular data (which it sounds like you do), using a table is perfectly appropriate.\nThe other way is with tabs. Show the ruler by hitting command-R (if it's not already visible). You should see triangles denoting the margins of the page. Click anywhere in the ruler to create a tab stop. Create some more. By default, tab stops are left-aligning, but if you double-click on an existing tab stop you cycle through center-aligning, right-aligning, and decimal-aligning (useful for lining up numbers like $100.10 and $100.).\nOnce you've got your tabs, start entering some text, with tabs where appropriate. If you want to adjust the tab stops, make sure to select the text it applies to first.\nIf you want to get really smart, once you've got everything set up exactly the way you like, you'll create a style. Hit command-shift-T to show the styles drawer (if it's not already visible), and click the + at the bottom of the drawer. Create a new paragraph style and call it whatever you want. Then you can apply it consistently to new text in the document.\nUsing columns to do this is possible but awkward. Using spaces is a bad idea because the text will never line up right—plus it's a PITA.\n\nA: The way I usually handle this sort of problem is to put all of the information in a 3 column table but hide all of the cell borders. This gives plenty of control over the formatting of each of the columns. \n\nA: Well to use a table is one option but there are some more elegant solutions which are built right into the Pages. \nIn the \"Template Chooser\" you can find many 3 column layouts which you could in principle take and modify and finish with that. \nOr you could do it all by yourself here is how: You open a blank page (preferably in landscape mode) and open the inspector. In the Layout tab you can create as many columns as you wish. This can also be done with a toolbar icon which is usually not present by default and create equally spaced 2, 3 and 4 columns.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro unresponsive for a few minutes after opening the lid, AirPort trying to reconnect to wifi I have a problem every time my 2010 MacBook Pro wakes up after I opened the lid.\nThe symptoms are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*The display is completely normal, I can see the latest program I used, the top bar menu, the dock, everything\n\n*Moving the mouse is ok, and so is typing\n\n*Clicks have no effect\n\n*AirPort is trying to connect to a network\n\n*Sometimes the network I usually use can't be found and I have to turn AirPort on & off to make it reconnect\n\n\nThis is really annoying!\nI use a 2010 MBP which runs Snow Leopard 10.6.8.

When it was locked, the \"Team Provisioning Profile is expiring in N days\" popup popped up and I wasn't able to dismiss it by hitting the two buttons of the popup itself. The only way I could regain access to the device was to restore it. Now I upgraded to 4.3.4 and hopefully the bug should be gone, but I didn't find anything like that in the changelog of the upgrade.\nThe device's log didn't show anything unusual, and I couldn't even turn the iPad off and on again because said popup is modal and you need to slide to confirm poweroff.\nDid anybody hit the same misbehaviour?

I recently moved countries and had to update my billing address in iTunes (change of full address and credit card info). This went fine, no problems whatsoever. It also meant that I had to change App Stores.\nUnfortunately in this process all items from my Purchased list disappeared. If only they're not listed, I don't much care for it, but I'd like to know whether I won't be charged again when I want to update them which would essentially mean re-buying the apps.\n\nA: So... unfortunately the answer is...\nYes, but there are ways around it...\nAll the apps you bought in country A are permanently assigned to your AppleID. Once you move to country B and you updated your details (billing address) you:\n\n\n*\n\n*still can use them\n\n*you cannot re-download them\n\n*you cannot update them\n\n*you cannot convert your music to iTunes Plus (but still can listen, obviously)\n\n\nThere are two solutions to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch Store's country and update your billing details each time you want to get your apps up to date (or re-download them). But this is a rather painful process, so a better solution is to...\n\n*Create a new AppleID with the billing details for the country B. Switching between AppleIDs is much easier and quicker than switching Store's country and updating your billing address.\n\n\nLet me quote why it has to be this way:\n\n[...] this how iTunes has been designed.\n\nSo. It's gonna be problematic, but nothing can be done really. :(\n\nA: There is no problem with switching the billing country as of November 2016 in terms of purchases.\nExcept, the only problem I had (after completely switching countries, in fact with different currencies) was that my purchase list in the App Store app was empty. It was an all new computer with no previous installations.\nHere is how it worked: once I find an app via Search, click BUY, the App Store app says something along the lines of \"there is no need to purchase this app because you already own it\" and then it downloads it without any problems.\nSo I suppose Apple fixed it with the only issue being the purchases list.\n\nA: In the past you couldn't do this without contacting support. I don't know when Apple changed iTunes on the computers, but you can simply sign in to your account and switch countries as long as you are not enrolled in iTunes Match or carrying a balance on your current store. Cancel or spend down as needed and then you can start the process of switching.\nI do not recommend anyone switch countries lightly - there are serious downsides like no longer getting re-downloads, app updates, and general confusion from support since an account that started in one country and migrated to another is an edge case that breaks many assumptions about how the app store works (and doesn't work).\n\nAlso, I feel the need to reiterate, I do not recommend most people to ever switch an account with any apps you are not ready to simply repurchase to another country.\nLosing app updates in the future is hard to guess and this switch is quite disruptive - moreso than juggling two accounts on one device in my experience.\n", "Q: Is it possible to burn a DVD out of the Lion app store install? Is it possible to burn a DVD out of the Lion app store install?\n\nA: Yes http://lifehacker.com/5812997/burn-the-mac-app-store-version-of-os-x-lion-to-a-dvd\n\nA: Yes!\nAfter you purchase and download Lion from the App Store, the \"Install\" screen will appear:\n\nBefore you click Continue, open your Applications folder and look for the icon labelled Install Mac OS X Lion:\n\nIf you missed this chance (and the App is deleted from your system), you can always re-download the package using the App Store app. Even if it shows Lion Installed, you can hold the option key pressed, then press the button to re-download the Lion installer app.\nRight-click (or Ctrl+Click) on this and choose Show Package Contents. Navigate to Contents > SharedSupport and look for InstallESD.dmg.\n\nUse Disk Utility (in the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder) to burn InstallESD.dmg to a DVD. Drag the InstallESD.dmg file to the Disk Utility window, select it, then choose Burn... from the Images menu.\nA dialog appears allowing you to burn it to a DVD. The name of the DVD doesn't really matter, but I named mine Mac OS X Lion.\n\n\nA: You can copy Install Mac OS X Lion.app — in its entirety — to a DVD that is not bootable. \nA widely promoted hack involves using only a part of the .app for 10.7 (Build 11A511) to create a DVD (or USB flash drive, or external hard disk partition) that is bootable. Bootable media produced in this way from this source may be good for some uses but please, proceed with caution: other uses may leave a system unusable. \nBe aware of the known risks, and unknowns, associated with straying from what is recommended by Apple. \n", "Q: How do I find out the status of a large download from the Mac App Store? I just started downloading OS X Lion, and it's 3.49 GB.\nThis is the extent of the user interface for the download process:\n\nIs there a place to see the download progress? Can I pause and/or resume the download?\n\nA: Aha... found it. In the App Store application menu, you can choose Store > Check for Unfinished Downloads which pops up a window like this:\n\n\nA: It's a bit of a hack, but you can check the size of ~/Library/Application Support/AppStore with Get Info in Finder -- assuming it's Lion that you're downloading, it should be about 3.5GB in total (I'm currently on 444MB, so it will take me a while).\n\nA: You can also just check the Purchased tab.\n", "Q: How long can I expect my system to be unusable during an upgrade to OS X Lion? I just downloaded Lion and am pretty eager to install it, but I can use every minute I have, so I'd rather not install it now if it means my system is unusable for 30+ minutes.\nHow long should I expect a Mac to be unusable during the upgrade process?\n\nA: After downloading it, the upgrade from Snow Leopard to Lion has taken 15-20 minutes on average and I literally have to do nothing to facilitate it. I grab a coffee and the upgrade's done before my cup's empty.\n\nA: The installation on my MacBook Pro (early 2009) took exactly 21 minutes on a Crucial C300 SSD. It initially estimated 35 minutes. Add two 30 seconds reboots.\n\nA: I'm running it on a sacrificial 2008 model iMac, 4Gb ram, 320Gb hard drive (with about 60Gb spare), 2.4 Ghz C2D processor. It reckons it's going to take about 35 minutes (and after 5 minutes is currently estimating about 30 minutes still).\nI think you really are going to have to accept that your system will be unusable for a half hour or so while you upgrade.... and if you don't backup first, and there's a problem, it could be unusable for a lot longer than that!\nI won't update my main work machine for a week or two yet, for this very reason.\n\nA: On my 2010 iMac 21\" it took about 90 minutes. In part this is because I have a lot of development tools on the system and it appears after having completed the upgrade that Lion rearranged and updated some of these tools (which is above and beyond the \"typical\" update).\n\nA: It's a safe bet that most people are out of business for less than an hour. Of course, you'll probably be spending hours exploring all the new features, so you might want to count that against your system being unusable for \"real work\" due to \"exploration and play\".\nSince you can't easily interrupt things and won't have use of the mac once the installer logs you out to start the upgrade, do give yourself a little window in case things run long.\nHere are some ballpark numbers people are reporting for upgrades with real life amounts of data on their macs:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac / Mac Pro + SSD: 8 to 15 minutes\n\n*iMac / Mac Pro + HD:  12 to 20 minutes\n\n*Portables: 15 to 30 minutes\n\n*full drives / Air with HD: 30 to 45 minutes\n\n\nFurthermore, you won't really know how long it will take if problems crop up moving thousands of tiny files or the process hangs. Then you will need to research what to do if trying again doesn't sort things out for you.\nEven if your install should take 15 minutes, why risk it until the pressure is off?\nThe problem with any prediction is that there are four parts to the install:\n\n\n*\n\n*common prep tasks (pre-download any updates - lion won't have many to pre download now since it's new)\n\n*a file system check of all your data (to avoid problems with bad files or bad file system structure)\n\n*the standard install (move the old, write the new - most macs capable of Lion will be within 50% of each other for this part)\n\n*upgrade script to crawl through all the your files and programs, upgrade things, and then delete the now un-needed files.\n\n\nParts 2 and 4 are where \"slow installs\" take the majority of your time.\nMost people will be done in less than an hour - but you can't really know if your install will go long until you let it start. It matters little that other people had a good experience if your is going to be especially slow.\nYou can run a full file system check before starting to be sure your directories won't trap the installer in an infinite loop, but other than deleting things like un-needed apps and files that might need \"migration\", you can't speed up the parts of the process that depend on your pre-existing data.\n\nA: This will depend on your Mac's disk subsystem more than anything, then CPU speed, as well as whether or not you elected to create a DVD from which to install Lion.\nMy 2011 iMac (3.4GHz i7, 16GB RAM, SSD+HDD) took 11.5 minutes from hitting the \"Install\" button, to being booted into Lion.\n\nA: It really depends on your system setup. I have installed it on 2 machines so far. \n\n\n*\n\n*On a Macbook Pro i5 w/8gb of ram it took approx. 35 minutes \n\n*On a Macbook Pro C2D w/4gb of ram it took almost an hour.\n\n\nA: It says 33 minutes at first reboot, but is taking more than 45. Mac book pro 4GB  core 2 duo 2.4GHz\n\nA: Appears to have stalled at the \"Install Mac OS X\" screen\nShows \"About 33 minutes\" for the last 15 minutes, with no movement of the progress bar.\nHoping it'll kick in soon.\nMid 2010 MBP 17\" w/ i7 4GB RAM approx 60GB free space on drive, 250GB drive.\nAnd as I typed this... It actually changed to \"About 32 minutes\" so I'm breathing again.\nAs identified above, number of files appears to be key, I have millions of files on this machine.\nCheers\n20 minutes into process.\n\nA: I just installed the upgrade and it took 45 minutes on a MacBook Pro mid 2010 spec. I have the 500 Gb drive partitioned equally mac and bootcamp. \nThe only problem I've found so far is that VMWare Fusion seems to have lost how it connects to my Bootcamp partition.  I've verified that the Bootcamp partition is still there by booting into it.\n\nA: Just upgraded my MacBook Pro 13in with an i5 and a 320 GB HD.\nThe download took about 25 minutes, and then about the same for the install process.\nWhile it was downloading I was able to work normally, so it was only unavailable during the 25 minutes of the install process.\nFree disk space actually increased (?! maybe it removed some old installer backup files); before I had 234 GB available, now df -h reports 239 GB available.\nAnother thing is that I had XCode 4 installed in Snow Leopard, and now it complained that it won't run on Lion. However, the new XCode is now free again in the App Store, so I downloaded it again and it runs fine now.\n\nA: New OS installs can have problems. OSX is not imune (though I'm going the guess most people will have a lot less trouble than XP -> Vista).\nThere's no advantage in running Lion. Well, Mission Control looks nifty, and the security will be great, and support for file versions will be a life saver for the muggles who don't use Git (or even dropbox), and autosave will even save hardcore Git user's bacon. \nThere's a new Python installation. Will that replace my interpreter? I doubt it, but a new install can take hours to recover from.\nJust play it safe. Or not. Find the bugs, and then alert me.\n", "Q: Does the 2011 13\" MacBook Air have a longer battery life than the old one? My understanding is that the new MacBook Air 2011 is using a new Intel CPU that uses less power. I expected that should mean either longer battery life or a lighter computer, but I can't remember how much battery life they claimed the old one had...\nShould I expect longer battery life from the new MacBook Air 2011?\n\nA: Apple hasn't changed the claims about battery life. 7 hours for the 13,3\", 5 for the 11,6\". It's a bit strange that according to Apple the batter life didn't change. Maybe we'll get a nice surprise.\nFound it here: http://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/20/apple-announces-new-13-3-inch-and-11-6-inch-macbook-air-models-with-flash-storage/\n\nA: Actually, the previous MacBook Air 13\" (2010) used a Core 2 Duo SL9400 or SL9600 which both have a TDP of 17W.\nThe new MacBook Air 13\" (2011) uses an i5-2557M or i7-2677M which both have a TDP of 17W too.\nI don't think we can say that these new CPU consume less power. \n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air specifications on Wikipedia\n\n*MacBook Air 2010 CPUs on Wikipedia\n\n*MacBook Air 2011 i5 CPU on Wikipedia\n\n*MacBook Air 2011 i7 CPU on Wikipedia\nMy personnal opinion is that Apple tried to stick to the power consumption while boosting the performance by switching to a more modern architecture. I do not expect Apple engineers to work on switching architecture AND improving power consumption at the same time.\nSo to answer your question: \nNo, I would not expect a longer battery life with these new CPUs. Even a little reduction for those with an 11\" MacBook Air because their CPU switched from 10W to 17W.\n\nA: The old spec information for Macbook Air can be found here, as of July 20th: http://www.macmall.com/p/Apple-MacBook-Air/product~dpno~8233199~pdp.gcgabeg\nNew spec info: http://www.apple.com/macbookair/specs.html\n", "Q: Is there a way to purchase the official Lion release when the Gold Master was previously installed?

When I bought my Macbook Pro I was told that when Lion came out I could get the upgrade for free.  How do I go about doing this?  I've searched the Apple.com website extensively and can't find information on this.\n\nA: The Lion up to date program is public. It currently says the deadline to ask for a free copy is August 19, 2011 and macs purchased on or after June 6, 2011 are eligible.\nOtherwise, Mac OS X 10.7 Lion will cost you $29.99, and is available on the Mac App Store (link). You can also go to an Apple store to download it (if you have a slow connection), and Apple will be making a version on a USB thumb drive available for $70. (More info here.)\n\nA: To answer the more general question as to what Apples policy is for software updates for Macs purchased in the run up to a major release: Historically, Apples 'Up-to-Date' programs for free or heavily discounted upgrades have been offered to those who have purchased a new Mac within 2 weeks (i.e. the duration of the standard return policy) of a major OS update. This is primarily done to prevent those users from simply returning and rebuying the machine on launch day. Additionally, at times, Apple has announced up to date availiability for everyone who has purchased a machine between the announcement of a specific release date and that release date. This is fairly uncommon however, and if they do so for Lion, you'll hear about it.\n\nA: The program initially allowed for people that bought macs on or after June 6, 2011 had a filing deadline of August 19, 2011. A follow-on program for macs purchased after July 21, 2011 has a 30 day after purchase claim window.\nBoth programs were documented at http://www.apple.com/macosx/uptodate/ . It looks like there was an August 2011 deadline to ask for a refund / free copy of Lion.\n\nHistorically, Apple honors upgrade / price matching requests for the time of the new purchase return period (2 weeks in the US) and has occasionally offered fulfillment plans to lengthen that window to encourage sales once a firm release date is announced. If you buy a new mac the day of a new software release (and until the new software gets included in the build at the factory) the box has a \"drop in kit\" installed with the new software free of charge.\nOf course you could always ask for a free upgrade, but since the window is 2 weeks, you might not convince someone to give you a free upgrade if the purchase was several months before the eventual release. If you have a good relationship with your seller - shoot them a mail or stop by the store to let them know to contact you if they can help with pricing when it releases.\nAlso, the price for 10.6 was $29 for 10.5 owners so depending on the release price details, that may affect how far back Apple chooses to offer gratis copies of the new Lion software.\n\nA: Yes. See this for more information.\n", "Q: Where can I get a Thunderbolt hub or splitter? Apple has just announced the new MacBook Airs, Mac mini, and Thunderbolt display. One of the features of the Thunderbolt display that caught my eye was its ability to daisy-chain two displays together from one Thunderbolt port (on a MacBook Pro).\nI already have two 24\" monitors and I don't feel like paying for two £900 displays. I worked out that all I need is a Thunderbolt hub/splitter so that I can plug the two cables that emerge into mini DisplayPort-to-DVI adapters.\nDoes anyone know of any Thunderbolt hubs or splitters? Or does anyone know of an alternative method?\n\nA: I think that this question has already been asked: \nDoes Thunderbolt support chaining multiple monitors to a MacBook Pro?\nTo sum it up, it is too early for a splitter or hub for a Thunderbolt port. But you can daisy chain.\nAnd this sums it up as well: http://www.the-cable-store.com/contents/en-us/d44_lightpeak_hubs.html\n\nA: This is a bit of a loaded question. Though your title refers to Thunderbolt the question solely references display daisychaining, so that's the aspect I'll try to address.\nHardware wise:\nThunderbolt 1 Apple devices have the ability to daisy chain Thunderbolt Displays but it seems that this is an Apple derived solution as TB 1 uses the DisplayPort 1.1 spec which DOES NOT have daisy chain capabilities. So if you have a TB 1 device it seems you are limited to daisychaining via TB ONLY through Apple Thunderbolt displays.\nThunderbolt 2, however, uses the DP 1.2 spec which DOES provide for MST (Multi Stream Transport). Using MST you should in theory be able to daisy chain upto 3 monitors off a single DP 1.2 connection*.\n*I haven't found a clear limit on the display max, however given the max data throughput of 17.28 Gbit/s of DP 1.2 we can figure that it would be able to just barely handle 3x 2560x1600 displays at 24 bpp and 60 Hz.\nThis item here seems to be able to do just exactly that (and similar adapters seem to be found with a quick search):\nhttp://www.startech.com/AV/Displayport-Converters/Mini-DisplayPort-Triple-Head-DisplayPort-Multi-Monitor-MST-Hub~MSTMDP123DP\nSoftware wise:\nPrior to the launch of the new Mac Pro there was no MST support in OS X. It was introduced with the launch of the Mac Pro to enable 4k (via MST) by identifying a 4k panel to the computer as 2 2160x1920 panels, whose streams were sent over the wire, identified and pieced together by the monitor.\nAs of 10.9.4 it seems that MST still does not work in a daisychain scenario in OS X. As far back as November 2013 it was reported working in Windows but I have not seen any information indicating a change in OS X.\n\nIts unfortunate but seems that at this point software is still preventing the proper operation of MST, possibly due to Apple's vested interest in their own daisychaining solution vs DP 1.2.\n\nA: At the very least, you can get one Thunderbolt display and daisy-chain one of your 24\" monitors off of that. I don't know about splitters; I haven't seen any.\n\nA: There is no hub or splitter available at present.\nAt the risk of leading to further open-ended discussion (something they don't like here on Ask Different), let me mention that Intel held a technology demonstration in September, last month, at their Intel Developers Forum, where they showed prototypes of many Thunderbolt peripherals and devices from several different manufacturers. For each one of them, they indicated that the product would be available for sale sometime in the summer of 2012.\nIn other words, there will be many types of Thunderbolt devices and peripherals at some point in the future, but there is very little on the market right now.\n\nA: This device allows you to connect two DVI monitors attached to one Thunderbolt/DisplayPort.\n\nA: I use this, Kensington Universal USB 3.0 Multi-Display Adapter (K33974AM), and it works great. I am splitting an HP and Apple Cinema Display.\n\nA: You want to connect two DVI monitors to one Thunderbolt port? Here you go: Mini Displayport to 2x DVI adapter offered by Matrox. Was searching for an adapter like this some months ago and this seems to be the best solution.\nI didn't tested it but it got 4 / 5 stars at Amazon. Maybe worth a try?\n\nA: I think the Caldigit Thunderbolt station is your best option. It has one Thunderbolt out and one HDMI out, that can be driven from 1 Thunderbolt connection on your MacBook.\nhttp://www.caldigit.com/thunderboltstation/\n", "Q: Can I reverse the two-finger scrolling direction in OS X Lion (10.7)? I just got 10.7. The two-finger scrolling direction seems wrong to me, although it says \"direction - natural.\" I couldn't see a way to reverse it.

I think they're going for consistency between iPads and mice.\n\nA: Oh, found it: It's just the check-box, I thought that turned off two-finger scrolling, not the direction.\n\nA: I have an older Mac, and the option to change this was unchecking the first option under trackpad: \"When using gestures to scroll or navigate, move content in the direction of finger movement.\"\nMaybe this new scrolling direction is better, but for now I have two Macs, and only one on Lion, so they need to be the same.\n\nA: the option only available when i used magic mouse, my macbook was early 2008 model\n", "Q: Where did the ~/Library folder go in Lion? I just installed Lion, and I can't find the Library folder in my user folder.\nDoes the folder no longer exist? If it doesn't, where are my preferences? If it does, how do I get to it?\n\nA: The ~/Library folder still exists, but it is hidden. You can easily unhide it by running the following command in Terminal (/Applicatiions/Utilities):\nchflags nohidden ~/Library\n\nNote that you'll have to do this again after each 10.7.X update (credit to Vincent).\nIf you want to reveal it on a per-use basis, you can get in by holding down option and clicking on the Finder's Go menu.\nOr, you can use Go-> Go to Folder and type in the path.\nOr, you can open Terminal and type open ~/Library\nThe app Lion Tweaks gives you an easy GUI way to change this setting, as well as other hidden Lion preferences.\n\nA: Simpler way.\nSet the Finder view to Columns (just for this exercise.  You can change it afterwards).\nClose Finder windows.\nHold Option key while going to Go in menu bar and selecting Library.  This opens a Finder window with the word \"Library\" in the title/name location at top center of window.  Release option key.\nClick and hold the folder next to \"Library\" and drag it into your sidebar where you want it.  Release.  \nDone\nIt will stay there until you Command-Drag it out, no matter how many SU for the 10.7.x OS you get.\n\nA: The ~/Library folder is still present but is \"hidden\" in OS X 10.7 by default, however there are a variety of ways to access ~/Library, depending on how frequently you need to access and on whether you want it to remain hidden.\nThe best summary of these methods is found at 18 ways to view the ~/Library folder in Lion. \n", "Q: Can I restore a Snow Leopard backup onto a Lion machine? So I am a little confused and slightly worried, and I was wondering if someone could answer this.\nI have a Time Machine backup saved on an external HD for my Mac mini that is running the latest version of Snow Leopard.\nIf I buy a new computer running Lion, will there be issues with using my Snow Leopard back-up to put my files on the new machine running Lion? Is that even possible? Or do I have to update my old computer to Lion first, and make a back-up before moving to the new computer?\n\nA: It's not complicated at all. I can't point to a current Lion Apple support doc but I just moved my old snow leopard time machine backup to my new Lion install.\nSimply launch Migration Assistant, select your Time Machine backup and select which settings and users to copy. It doesn't care that your backup is a Snow Leopard backup.\nFor more information here is an article about how to use Migration Assistant in Snow Leopard. It is virtually the same in Lion.\nhttp://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/27921.html\n\nA: I can't say if you can run migration directly but hope you can. If not, it's still not that bad so don't be overly worried :-)\nWorst case, you will have to use something like Disk Utility to restore one of the Time Machine snapshot folders to a volume (like an external drive) where it will look close enough like a bootable external drive. \nFrom there you should have no issues using the Migration Assistant to migrate that old data (either directly from the Time Machine folder - or copied onto a hard drive) just like the migration assistant supports to migrate from an external drive.\nIn the past, I have been able to use Disk Utility to make a DMG file from a Time Machine folder and use Migration Assistant on 10.6 to migrate that data - but I haven't really tested it with Lion yet.\nYou will be able to do it with some time and spare cheap USB hard drive (or perhaps enough drive space for a whole image copy of one snapshot in time) - it's just a matter of how many steps and disk space are needed.\n\nA: You can restore files on Lion from Time Machine. See @Steve Moser's answer for the OS.\n", "Q: Is there a way to swipe down instead of up to launch Mission Control? To me it feels more natural to \"pull\" down the Desktop down to access Mission Control however System Preferences for the Magic Trackpad only allow for swiping up to access Mission Control.\nIs there a hidden terminal preference or app that would enable swipe down to activate Mission Control?\n\nA: BetterTouchTool lets you assign arbitrary tap/swipe/click gestures to arbitrary commands.\nIt supports Lion.\n\nA: No.\nNo way I can find without a third party-app, anyway.  I tried changing the function that is mapped by default to three-fingers-down (App Expose) to see if it would 'free it up' for mission control, but no dice.\nI'm finding a lot of things like that (reversed scrolling!!!) less comfortable/intuitive, but trying where I can to just get used to them, as I expect they'll feel just as good eventually, and if so, will become standard practice all over the place.   (Yes, I know that \"get used it\" isn't what you asked for, but on this one, I don't think you can default to the old method you used for expose.)\n\nA: You can change the scrolling by going to preferences and track pad then unselect natural scroll\n", "Q: Can Time Machine volumes be easily encrypted with FileVault 2? Now that File Vault 2 can encrypt the entire disk and encrypt external drives, can I have a fully encrypted Time Machine volume?\n\nA: According to the Lion features page, encrypted backups are supported.\n\nA: Daniel Jalkut's blog today has a post that may be what you're looking for.\nhttp://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1935/lions-whole-disk-encryption\nApparently, this:\n% diskutil cs convert /Volumes/Data -passphrase [yourPasswordHere]\n\nI haven't tried this yet, I just got Lion installed about an hour ago.

I've just installed OS X Lion on my iMac, and I want to make an installation DVD, so that I can reinstall without having to first install Snow Leopard.\nThe way to create the DVD is answered elsewhere, but it seems that the installer gets auto deleted after the installation of Lion completes.\nIt looks like I'll have to re-download the 4Gb Lion installer again, but when I try to download it again via the App store, I'm told a newer version already exists, and I'll have to move it to the trash first.\nI've double checked, and there isn't another version of the installer present.\nHow can I now create the install disk?\n\nA: You can re-download Lion even though it has already been installed by holding down the option key before clicking Purchased. \nDo not release the key until after the option to Install appears alongside OS X Lion.\nThe workaround may be more reliable if something other than Purchased is in foreground before alt/option-clicking Purchased. \nBurn the installer to disc, then delete it when you're done with it.\n", "Q: What should I do when \"An error has occurred\" when downloading Lion? I'm trying to download the new Mac OS. When click install, the icon pops onto the dock and says Waiting...\nAfter about 5 minutes, it disappears and in the purchased category of the Mac App Store, next to install it says:\n\nAn error has occurred\n\nWhy is this happening?\nEdit: \nOriginally I could not even get the download bar in the purchased section until I reconfigured my router slightly(I'm using a BT Business Hub). I am now able to get the download bar. However, I still get \"Waiting...\" on the icon and after about 3 minutes, I receive the same error message:\n\nAn error has occurred\n\nI still believe that it is a router problem and not the app stores' servers. Has another been able to fix this yet?\nHere is a screenshot when I click the install button:\n\nAnd here is a screenshot after about 2 minutes:\n\n\nA: I have sorted the issue. I just had to use a different router. The BT Business hub that I previously been using had a problem on it which prevented anything above 2GB do loose connection. This would explain other problems as well.\n\nA: I had a similar event.  I was able to solve the problem by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Signing out the app store\n\n*Closing app store\n\n*Clearing cookies in safari (evidently app store uses safari's cookies)\n\n*Reopen app store\n\n*Sign-in to the App Store\n\n*Press Option and click Purchases\n\n*Click Resume on OS X Mountain Lion under Other Purchases\n\n\nMaybe this will help?\n\nA: Because a lot of Mac users are probably doing the same download now. It's probably overloaded. After all 4 GB is a good bit bigger than an iTunes song or an iOS app.\n\nA: Make sure you have downloaded all the latest system updates - there is one which will prepare the mac app store for lion. I had the same problem and it seems to be working now!\n\nA: Run Console to check the recent logs for more details (look for com.apple.installd).\nIn example, I had something like:\ncom.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.installd[69518]) Job appears to have crashed: Abort trap: 6\nReportCrash[69520]: Saved crash report for installd[69518] version 332 to /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/installd_2014*.crash\n\nIf you see the crash in your logs, then check the backtrace under System Diagnostic Reports, so there is something like:\nTerminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[NSKeyedUnarchiver initForReadingWithData:]: incomprehensible archive\n\nThe reason for that could be that some of the downloaded files are corrupted.\nSo to solve that, you have to remove these files and try again.\n\nSimple solution\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit your App Store\n\n*Run Finder.\n\n*Go to (CMD+Shift+G): /private/var/folders.\n\n*Trash all the folders from that folder (e.g. vp, zz).\n\n*Run App Store and re-try.\n\n\nIn case something bad happens, restore these removed files from your Trash.\n\nAdvanced solution\nFrom Terminal check if you've temporary files here:\nls -la /private/var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.appstore\n\nAnd then try to remove them (you may backup them first just in case):\nrm -frv /private/var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.appstore\n\nAnd re-try again.\n\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4483444\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4234582\n\nA: I had the same problem.

I like using the debug menu on the Snow Leopard App Store app by enabling it with \n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true\n\nDoes the same toggle work on the Lion version of the app?\n\nA: The debug menu is available in the Lion app store, with the same command as you posted.\n\nI don't see any other hidden prefs of interest:\nNSWindow Frame Preferences\" = \"-1 53 1289 1005 0 0 1920 1058 \";\nShowDebugMenu = 1;\nWebKitUserStyleSheetEnabledPreferenceKey = 1;\navailableUpdates =     (\n    );\n\n", "Q: How can I make the Cisco VPN Client work with Lion? Worked in Snow Leopard and now gives error 51 and the sudo restart system command in Terminal i used to use doesn't work.  Any idea?\n\nA: This is due to Lion booting into a 64 bit kernel verses older releases starting in 32 bit mode. There is no patch but a simple workaround involves booting into 32 mode and running the VPN client normally. This method will work on 10.7 until Cisco actually creates a 64 bit extension for mac os x. Details for booting into 32 bit mode are here: http://9to5mac.com/2011/03/20/new-macbook-pros-default-boot-in-64-bit-mode/\nCheers, -mjh\n\nA: Fix Issue with Cisco VPN on Lion 64bit\nOn Mac OSX Lion system kernel runs in 64bit mode by default.\nCisco VPN in the clinic will not start and comes up with the error:\nError 51: Unable to communicate with the VPN subsystem.\nPlease make sure that you have at least one network interface that is currently active and has an IP address and start this application again.\nTo be able to successfully run VPN you need to boot your mac with 32 bit kernel.\nOption 1 (Boot 32 bit kernel for this session only)\nTo boot into 32bit one time hold 3 and 2 keys when rebooting until you see the desktop.

I had serious issues with Cisco's client (it kept kernel panik-ing my Mac) and had the IT department help me set up the built in client.\nIt basically works the same way as it does on an iPhone or iPad, so if you can connect with that device, you should be able to do so as well with your Mac.\nWhat I needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*the ip address of the VPN Server\n\n*the Group Name\n\n*the shared Secret\n\n\nLogin was done by using Active Directory authentication.\nThis is how I set it up:\nIn System Preferences -> Network hit the + button on the bottom of the list.

You can leave the login stuff empty as you'll be prompted when connecting.\nHit the Authentication Settings... button.\n\nEnter the group name (IT) and the shared secret. If your IT guys don't want to hand the data out to you, then ask them to kindly enter it for you. \nHit OK and then Apply your settings and you should be pretty much able to connect now. I like to have the Show VPN status in menu bar option enabled in order to have quick access to turn on and off the connection. \nI also had to add one additional thing in order to be able to access remote computers just by their name instead of having to type name.domain. To do so I hit the Advanced... button and added our domain name to the Search Domains.\n\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: How can I stop unwanted notifications from Google Calendar on an iPhone? My wife finds that her iPhone constantly reminds her of google calendar events (accessed via the exchange trick). None of the google events have reminders enabled. The phone preferences don't ask for reminders. Yet reminders she gets.\n\nA: This is actually a default setting by Google that can be changed.  To change this setting \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Google Calendar settings found in the top right under the gear icon.\n\n*Select the Calendar tabs\n\n*Click the Shared: Edit settings link for the calendar you want to edit.\n\n*Select the Notifications tab\n\n*Click the remove link next to the reminders you don't want.\n\n\nPlease note that this will only fix events created from this point forward, you will still have to change all the notifications in events that were previously setup.\n\nA: There is a setting on your iPhone for calendar notifications you can turn off:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.\n\n*Go to Notifications.\n\n*Go to Calendar.\n\n*Go to Shared Calendar Changes.\n\n*Turn off all the notifications here.\n\n\nA: It seems there are a number of different sources of event alerts and notifications when both Google and Apple are involved, so I'll post a solution to one that hasn't been mentioned yet here. If the event itself shows an alert when you inspect it in Calendar, with the word \"(default)\" after it, then go into Calendar Settings | Alerts, select the relevant account, and choose \"None\" in the dropdown for either Events or All Day Events as appropriate. Unfortunately there's no way to edit this preference per-calendar from the Mac side, and for shared calendars like Holidays from Google there's no editing to be done there either.\n\n\nA: My solution is detailed here. I wrote a script to remove unwanted extra alerts\nhttps://darrengosnell.blogspot.com/p/ical-gmail-osx-repeated-email.html\nI hope it helps you :-)\n\nA: Go to Google on your iPhone (Google App), and the first story that has the hamburger menu (3 stacked dots), click it and choose Customize Google Now.  You can then turn off various things.  For example, I have no interest in Sports so I turn off these notifications. \n", "Q: Why won't my iPad sync photos (\"not enough memory\") when it's half empty? When I try to sync my iPad, it aborts on the last step, indicating that it can't be synced, becuase \"not enough memory is available\":\n\nBut I have LOTS of room:\n\nAnd it all fit before - I actually have about 8GB of photos that all fit with  ~20GB to spare until today.   The above image is after I set it to only sync the last 20 photo projects (I'm using aperture) to see if space was really an issue, and it's clearly not.\nHowever, photos do seem to be a part of the problem:   if i turn off photo sync, it works, but if I reduce the photos being synced (sunk? syunk?) to a de minimis number, it doesn't.\nThe catalyst for the problem is pretty likely either the new version of itunes or of OSX, as both were upgraded just before the problem manifested.  Any help?  I miss my pictures. \n\nA: I have had iTunes go off the deep end thinking there were far too many photos.\nI have had luck with several tacks so I presume there are a few bugs - one of which you may have run into:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take the device to another computer (or another iTunes library on a shell account) and let it sync and erase all photos on iOS. Taking it back to the main iTunes library which has the correct photos sometimes works. I presume the error was an accounting one on the iPad when this works.\n\n*Change photo sync to a simple folder with a jpeg or two, sync it, and then change back to the settings I prefer. (rarely works)\n\n*Rebuild the affected library in Aperture or iPhoto - this seems to force new data into the media browser so iTunes is forced to take a better look at the sizes for your albums and photos as organized.\n\n\nSorry I don't have a sure fire answer - but maybe you haven't tried all of these or it sparks an idea of something else you can try.\n\nA: Okay I Had the same problem when I tried syncing my music on my Iphone I did some messing around with my itunes and I finally found the way to fix it and what I did was unselected evrything that I wanted to sync to my phone basically did a blank sync between my phone and computer which I guess let itunes know what was on my phone and what was on the computer because after I had done that I resulected what I wanted to sync and it worked perfect. Hopes this helps because I spent hours trying to find a solution on the internet and nothing worked.\n", "Q: What tools are people using to check for Lion compatible software? I don't have a lot of extra software on my Mac, but wondered what tools people are finding useful for aggregating or checking that existing software is ready for Lion.\nI'm also wondering if I need to buy new versions of iLife - will iLife 08 work OK with Lion?\nI almost hesitate to ask, since the best solution is to dutifully check with each vendor - they are the best resource, but has anyone found a good resource that lists or aggregates software that is either known to have issues or is reported to be good to go Lion?\n\nA: I've used RoaringApps' Compatibility Table, which seems fairly comprehensive.\nHowever, their servers seem a bit bogged-down at the moment.\n(edit - as of July 26 - it's still very slow to use)\n\nA: lipo\nIf you have lipo, probably installed with Xcode, a four-line command will list some files that are PowerPC-only: \nsh\n2>/dev/null find ~/Applications /Applications -type f -perm +111 -exec lipo \\\n-info '{}' ';' | grep -w Non-fat | grep -w ppc &&\\\nexit\n\nI experimented with the script in an application,  http://www.wuala.com/grahamperrin/public/2011/07/12/ppc-lister/ for anyone who's interested. I stopped experimenting when I realised that lipo is probably not present on the average Mac. \nEither way, what's above is a rough approach. Finding some thing PowerPC-only within an .app may not mean that the .app as a whole is incompatible with Lion. \nSystem Information\n(Successor to System Profiler)\nThe list of applications produced by System Information is better for identifying .app bundles that are PowerPC-only. \nYou can copy from the bottom half of the window, but there are sometimes ten or more lines per application. In System Information 10.7 (733) you can not copy simpler lines from the top half of the window. \n\nA: While this is not directly germane to your question, I hope you will find it useful.\nI use CNET's TechTracker to scan my Applications folder each day and inform me if there are any newer versions or updates of any of the software programs I have installed on my system. I can then download all available updates directly from a single page on download.cnet.com in most cases. It's a useful service and the basic version is free. It is particularly helpful in times such as this when Apple has recently released a new operating system, because many software publishers are putting out new updates all the time.\n\n", "Q: Why does iTunes think my SIM card is unsupported? I recently bought an unlocked iPhone 4 from the US. I live in the UAE. I had a normal SIM card and I cut it and installed it into iphone and it started working.\nBut when I tried to upgrade to the most recent iOS version using iTunes, at the end of the installation it says Your SIM card does not appear to be supported.\nWhen I went to my carrier office they gave me SIM card which works in their iPhone (UAE) but it does not work in my iPhone (US).\nI am worried about what happened to it. I bought it just one week back. Now I am not able to even start it; it's not detecting my SIM (which is working in other iPhone).\nAny idea what the problem is? What should I do? Shoud I format it? \n\nA: If the handset was unlocked using UltraSn0w, then you have completely removed it by updating the firmware to the latest version (Ultrasn0w only supports iOS 4.3.3). Worse yet, this has updated your baseband and that cannot be reverted even if you manage to downgrade the OS (unless you used Pwnage Tools or Sn0wbreeze as they can preserve the baseband during update). If this is indeed the case, you have now a locked phone to whatever carrier it was purchased under (AT&T) and you will have to talk to that carrier for a \"hard\" unlock.\nTo my knowledge, a \"true\" unlocked iPhone has no geographic limitations. As long as the network supports GSM phones (read: SIM cards), then there should be no problem.\n\nA: This means that your carrier is not supported with your version iPhone. I don't know anything about the United Arab Emirates, but I am guessing that your UAE SIM does not work with your US phone. \nThus, I think that you should get:\na: A UAE iPhone\nor \nb: A US SIM\nYou may want to consider checking your phone out at an Apple store or something similar before doing either of these, checking to make sure that your phone isn't to blame. (It shouldn't be, but you never know)\n\nA: Are u sure your phone was originally unlocked by Apple when u bought it? Did you buy it from an Apple store or online unlocked? These are questions you need to answer to get to the root of the issue. \nIf theres a chance that it was bought attached to a network e.g AT&T but later unlocked then after restoring or updating the phone, it won't work with another sim. \n\n", "Q: What's the deal with Xcode's price? So... prior to Xcode 4, Xcode was always free. Then 4.0 cost $5 for non-developers. Now 4.1 is free. I'm just a little confused with this situation.\n4.1 is Lion only (no SL support). Is 4.1 free and 4.0 is still $5? Are the price tags removed for both versions? I just need someone to clear up the situation a little for me.\n\nA: Here's what we know:\n\n\n*\n\n*When Xcode 4.0 hit the store - it was $4.99 and ran on Snow Leopard\n\n*Xcode 4.1 hit the store July 20 (Lion launch day) for free but requires Lion. It replaces the prior version so that's effectively not for sale any longer.\n\n\nUnless you feel someone that has a hand in pricing decisions from Apple will answer here, the rest is speculation.\n\nA: Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nThe act which was passed after the Enron scandel prohibits companies from adding new unadvertised features to a product after the sale.  Apple has done this with iPod Touch software upgrades, FaceTime, and now Xcode. So in a sense Xcode 4.1 is included in price of Lion.\n\nA: It appears that 4.1 is has been made free; and 4.0 is no longer available in the App Store as it has been replaced with 4.1.\n\nA: You paid for the optional 4.1 dev tools as part of paying for Lion.  Snow Leopard buyers didn't pay for Xcode 4.0, so it wasn't downloadable for free for them (except to enrolled developers who did pay $99.)\nBefore Snow Leopard, Xcode or Project Builder came on an optional CD/DVD disk that was part of what the customer paid for.  So now it's back to the same (in digital download form) with Lion.\n", "Q: What would make an app incompatibile with OS X Lion? Good ways to test or check the compatibility with Lion is being asked in a different question: What tools are people using to check for Lion compatible software?\nWhat, generally, would make an app—that works with Snow Leopard—incompatibile with Lion? Could I have an educated guess whether app works / doesn't work / works partially with Lion based on some features?\nWhat does, for example, all the apps reported \"Not working\" or \"Has some problems\" on RoaringApps Compatibility table have in common?\n\nA: My educated guess would be:\n1) Any apps that deal with operating system files\n2) Any Power PC apps\nThese guesses are just based upon the information given in the app profile on roaring apps and about what apple has told me.\n\nA: In general all programs call on the operating system to do things. These are the API - application programming interface.\nLion changes some API, adds new ones, and deletes old ones. The biggest problem is when a program needs an API that is now gone. The second issue is when things change. Lastly, when a new feature like Mission Control is introduced, perhaps the older program isn't expecting it's windows to be moved around in that manner.\nThe assumptions made by a developer can turn out to no longer be true which will cause little or big glitches.\nAlso - programs that don't use API but just react to things as they are can break when those things move. For example - if a program assumed ~/Library is visible - then it would clearly break when running on a clean version of Lion.\nDevice drivers change - that can cause errors.\nLastly, entire compatibility layers like Rosetta are dropped.\n", "Q: How do I go back and forward in Chrome using a Magic Mouse in Lion? Before installing Lion, I could use the \"double finger left/right swipe\" gesture to go back and forward in the history in Google Chrome.\nAfter installing Lion, I can't find any mouse gesture that implements this.\nThe new version of Safari uses a single finger swipe to go back and forward in history. Is there any way to emulate this in Chrome? Or, failing that, is there any other gesture for back/forward in Chrome?\n\nA: IDK about the Magic Mouse but three finger swiping works on the Magic Trackpad\nBy default swiping between pages is set to two fingers in Lion. However chrome doesn't currently recognize two finger swiping but it does recognize three finger swiping.\nTo enable three finger back and forward swiping simply go to the Magic Trackpad preferences and set \"Swipe between Pages\" to \"Swipe left or right with three fingers\".\nUpdate\nGoogle has updated Chrome to work with a one finger swipe for the Magic Mouse and a two finger swipe for the Magic Trackpad in Lion.\n\nA: There is a setting for this and it can be turned off / on:\n\nTo get there, go to Settings -> Mouse -> More Gestures\n\nA: As of a late v16 version of the browser, Chrome now honors the preference of single-finger swipe to navigate back and forth. I am unsure of exact version numbers, however, in the v16 series after this feature was implemented, it was shortly followed up by an arrow that will float over the page and drift left or right, pointing either back or forward, and when that arrow is dragged over at least half the page, it is fully opaque and will actually cause the desired navigation to appear.\nIn either v17 or v18, that changed so that a small quarter circle with an arrow on the edge pops out from the relevant side of the page (left = back, right = forward), and when it stops animating any further out from the page edge you can lift your finger in order to cause the desired navigation to occur. If you don't wish to navigate back/forward, simply scroll horizontally in the opposite direction and collapse the arrow/pop-over.\n\nA: I could not find a way to make it work with core utilities but I found a way to make it work with BetterTouchTool.

(and etc with forward)\n\nA: Three finger swipe works, and this what happened to Chrome: \nhttp://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-bugs/browse_thread/thread/be8a86eb6bf98f1c?fwc=1&pli=1\n\nA: I found this whole thing quite frustrating too.

My hard disk is starting to get a bit cramped, with only 30GB available. I'm about download Lion and I'd like to know if I'll need to free up some space before I install it.\nAlso, I've read that Lion creates a hidden partition with a bare-bones copy of OS X for emergency system recovery. How large is it? How much space will I lose after installing Lion?\n\nA: According to http://www.apple.com/support/lion/installrecovery/ you only need 7G of free space.\nAmazingly small amount of space considering the download is 3.6G itself. \nMany are reporting gaining back between 5 and 10 GB of space as Lion is more compact than Snow Leopard.\n\nA: You should be fine with 30GB of space.

I have 2 macbooks (the unibody and the one before that). Do I need to buy two licenses or can I just use one license for both machines?\n\nA: Like everything else you purchase in the Mac App Store, you can install Lion on all of your Macs after buying it once. There is no activation process or DRM.\nHere's the relevant excerpt from Lion's license agreement (emphasis mine):\n\nIf you obtained a license for the Apple Software from the Mac App\n  Store, then subject to the terms and conditions of this License and as\n  permitted by the Mac App Store Usage Rules set forth in the App Store\n  Terms and Conditions (http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/ww/) (\"Usage\n  Rules\"), you are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive\n  license:\n(i) to download, install, use and run for personal, non-commercial\n  use, one (1) copy of the Apple Software directly on each Apple-branded\n  computer running Mac OS X Snow Leopard or Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server\n  (\"Mac Computer\") that you own or control;\n\n\nA: Technically you can use the Lion installer app from the app store to all your mac. Don't forget to move the installer from Applications folder before install Lion. it will deleted if you won't move the installer after the installation process.\nAnother good alternative is to create bootable DVD installer for Lion. You can use it to install Lion for all your mac. Follow this step to create it\n\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/161069/2011/07/make_a_bootable_lion_installer.html\n\nAnyway i have tried both from installer app and bootable DVD installer to install Lion for several mac. It works well.\n\nA: You have to have your employer buy a license.\nYour personal license can be used to install Lion on every Mac you own or control for personal, non-comercial, use. So it can't be used to install Lion on your computer at work. Your employer can buy a license and use it to install Lion on each of the Macs it owns or controls, as the following statement says:\n\nIf you obtained a license for the Apple Software from the Mac App Store [...] you are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license [...] (if you are a commercial enterprise or educational institution) to download, install, use and run one copy of the Apple Software for use [...] by a single individual on each of the Mac Computers that you own or control\n\nTaken from: http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macosx107.pdf\n", "Q: Apart from being able to encypt an entire volume, what are the other differences of FileVault 2 over FileVault? Does FileVault 2 in Lion have any other differences compared to the old version, FileVault in previous releases of the system?  Are there any additional benefits to using the new version?\n\nA: Password less 'Guest' accounts can no longer be created since the whole disk is encrypted than just the User's home directory. It's sad that I could not find any information on the kb article in Apple about this.\n\nA: The new Filevault seems to put far fewer constraints on you than the old version.  You don't have to log out for time machine to work, for example, and all the sharing daemons appear to work fine (some of them were disabled when filefault was enabled if I recall correctly. I think web sharing was among them, which made my laptop a bit useless as a development platform for web applications :) ).  \nOne problem with Filevault 2 is you can't ssh into a machine until you've entered a password locally, as the startup process can't commence until the encrypted drive has been unlocked. \n\nA: Borrowing heavily from John Siracusa's Lion review...\nFileVault 2 is a Whole Disk Encryption system, as opposed to just a 'store your home folder in an encrypted disk image' solution. It's implemented as a filesystem layer below the actual volume that you unlock at system boot time. If you're familiar with LVM, it's much the same way. Whenever you get past the password lock, everything looks the same to the rest of the system.\nAs Steve mentioned, the encryption work can be aided by specialized processor instructions, and runs entirely in the background. What's nice is that you can turn disk encryption on a full drive, and everything will be done at leisure (you can shut it down, bring it back up, etc. and everything will continue).\n\nA: *\n\n*It supports AES-NI which offloads encrypting and decrypting on supported CPUs (some core i5's and i7's).\n\n*You can store your encryption key with Apple.\n\n\nI'm sure there are a few other. This Apple support article should answer the rest of your questions.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4790\n\nA: FileVault 2 LVG failures may be irreparable\nFrom the manual page for fsck_cs: \n\nThe fsck_cs utility verifies and repairs CoreStorage logical volume group metadata.\n\n...\n\nBUGS\nfsck_cs does not perform an exhaustive validation, nor is it able to fix many of the inconsistencies that it does detect.\n\nIssues with FileVault 1\nfsck_hfs (used by Disk Utility) has been developed for more than ten years and is capable of repairing most issues with JHFS+ as used by FileVault 1. \nShould you encounter an issue that fsck_hfs can not repair, there are multiple alternative third party utilities. \nCore Storage issues with FileVault 2\nfsck_cs (also used by Disk Utility) first appeared along with CoreStorage in Mac OS X 10.7.0. Inconsistencies may be irreparable. \nIn the absence of alternatives to fsck_cs\nIf LVG failure occurs and fsck_cs can not make necessary repairs, then your startup volume will not mount. In this situation you may destructively reformat the disk and reinstall Mac OS X. (Using Recovery OS Time Machine alone will not provide the Apple_Boot Recovery HD that's required for FileVault 2.) \n\nA: One drawback I can see is that before you could encrypt individual user accounts, whereas now you can only encrypt the whole disk. If you encrypt the whole disk, you also have to decrypt the whole disk every time you use the computer. This means that once the computer is booted, the whole disk is accessible to malware, whereas before you could log in (and soon again out of) to security-critical accounts separately.\nI suppose you can still use encrypted disk images on top of FileVault for really important data.\nAnother problem could be Time Machine. Whereas before the FileVault users' directories were also stored encrypted on the backup volume, that does not seem to be the case anymore.\nDoes anyone know if Time Machine now support whole-disk encryption as well (from the reports so far it seems to be not enabled for external drives, at least not via the GUI)?\nUpdate: Apparently, Time Machine does not support whole-disk encryption: Can Time Machine volumes be easily encrypted with FileVault 2?\n\nA: For multiple administrators: FileVault 2 alone is less secure than FileVault 1 \nSimilar to the answer offered by Thilo. This logic applies to any computer with two or more administrators.\nFileVault 1 in Snow Leopard and in Lion\nThere is a good level of security to prevent a person without the master password from accessing any other person's data.\nFileVault 2 alone\nAny administrator can view, copy, edit all other users' data.\nExample\nTwo business partners share a computer, both administrators. One of the two partners might like to keep something private. The partner who holds the master password, who wishes to keep something private, does not give that password to the other partner.\nWith FileVault 2 alone in such scenarios, security and privacy are easily ignored — sudo comes immediately to mind.\nComparison\nZFS encryption in Oracle Solaris, which can apply to users' home directories.\n\nWorkaround\nIf a user of FileVault 2 in the situation above requires the extra security, that person can:\n\n*\n\n*add a separate disk, internal or external\n\n*on that disk, have a Core Storage encrypted logical volume (LV) with a Disk Password that differs from both (a) the Disk Password for the OS startup volume and (b) all user passwords for the startup volume\n\n*store their home directory on the LV on the separate disk\n\n*match the password for their user account to the Disk Password for the LV.\n\nAlternatively, that person might use just a part of an existing disk … but partition management in and around coreStorage world is difficult, so for long-term simplicity: I would recommend investment in an additional/separate disk.\n\n/var/folders\nExpect some user data to be written to a subdirectory of  /private/var/folders – all administrators will have access to this data. A solution for this is beyond the scope of this question.\n\nA: Partition management in and around coreStorage world is difficult\nFor a disk that uses FileVault 2 — or any other application of Core Storage — it may be impossible to add or resize partitions using Disk Utility. \nIn Super User: \n\n\n*\n\n*an answer under How do I resize a FileVault 2 encrypted partition?\n\n*an answer under Create new partition on encrypted volume in OS X Lion.\n\n\nExpect Apple's diskutil(8) Mac OS X Manual Page to be updated for 10.7 in due course. In the meantime, if you already installed Lion, read the man page in Terminal.\n\nA: FileVault 1 can be disabled for individuals\nFor any user who uses FileVault 1: \n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences allow you to disable FileVault for that user alone, provided there is sufficient free space. \n\n\nEnabled users of FileVault 2 can not be disabled\nIn Mac OS X 10.7 (Build 11A511) you can allow a user to unlock the startup volume, but once enabled: \n\n\n*\n\n*that user alone can not be disabled\n\n*only FileVault 2 in its entirety can be disabled. \n\n\nDisable a user's ability to unlock a FileVault 2 volume at startup/login time\n\nA: Lion Recovery Disk Assistant lacks support for FileVault 2\nVersion 1.0 of the assistant used with FileVault 2 in Mac OS X 10.7 (Build 11A511) does produce a Recovery OS on a USB flash drive. However: \n\n\n*\n\n*the computer can not boot from that Recovery OS. \n\n\nI found this problem with two different computers. \n\nA: Some installations can not use FileVault 2\nNot all installations of Lion gain the hidden Apple_Boot Recovery HD that is required for FileVault 2 — OS X Lion: \"Some features of Mac OS X Lion are not supported for the disk (volume name)\" appears during installation (2011-07-21).\n\n… You won't be able to use FileVault …\n\nIf this happens — and if you abandoned FileVault 1 before the upgrade to Lion — your Mac with Lion will be less secure.\nThe advice published by Macworld before the release of Lion continues to advise users to disable FileVault 1 before installing Lion. It's most unusual for Macworld to give advice that is contentious but in this case, I disagree strongly. \n\nA: Lion makes FileVault 1 homes less easy to create\nEasiest to create the FileVault 1 home in Snow Leopard before upgrading to Lion. \nIf without Snow Leopard: you can use Lion to create the home, but there are a few steps to the routine.\nAfter disabling Filevault 1, is it possible to enable it again in Lion?\n\nA: FileVault 2 prevents remote restart\nDo not expect remote access to the EFI loginwindow.\n\nA: Disabling FileVault 1 may worsen performance\nTwo reasonably-sized volumes (one a home directory), with a good set of B-trees, are probably easier for the system to manage — and almost certainly perform better — than a single colossal volume with attributes and catalog B-trees that are oversized and fragmented. \nExplanation\nFileVault 1 uses bands of a size that is optimised.\nDepending on the content of a home directory, abandoning those bands in favour of a greater number of smaller files may significantly increase the sizes and fragmentation of the following critical areas of the startup volume:\n\n\n*\n\n*attributes B-tree\n\n*catalog B-tree\n\n*extents B-tree.\n\n\nEnlarged B-trees can be unexpectedly problematic\nWhat follows is debatably beyond the scope of the opening question, and relatively technical, but for any user of a computer with (a) limited memory and (b) a considerable number of files within and outside their home directory, it's worth thinking about before abandoning FileVault 1. \nIf the sum of the sizes of the B-trees is too great, and if repair is required, third party utilities on your computer may be unable to repair the damage.\nIf a volume is irreparable by fsck_hfs — most obviously using Disk Utility, less obviously whenever the system encounters a file system that is dirty — a user may turn to a respected third party utility.\nExample\nI encountered a situation where the sum of the sizes of the B-trees — in relation to the physical memory — was too great for a third party utility to work as required for a Core Storage encrypted backup volume that was irreparable by fsck_hfs. As my MacBookPro5,2 can take no more than 8 GB, so for some time this volume was read only.\nI might have taken the volume, with or without the computer, to a service provider for attention in an environment with more memory. However for security, I should not provide to any third party — however well trusted — the passphrase or key for some types of volume.\nEventually and unexpectedly the fsck_hfs in Lion did repair the volume without me using Disk Utility, possibly thanks to me experimentally (riskily?) removing the volume from coreStorage world (reverting, completely converting backwards) whilst in the irreparable and read-ony state. That was a pleasing outcome for me, and a thumbs-up to Apple for the qualities and capabilities of 10.7 (Build 11A511), but this should serve as a caution to other readers.\n\nA: FileVault 1 impact on performance\nIn my experience, the impact is usually acceptable. I'd like to see relevant benchmarks.\nPerformance comparisons\nIn Ask Different: Speed of old Filevault vs. new Lion full disk encryption\n\n\n*\n\n*my answer there (work in progress) includes some technical data. \n\n\nFileVault 2 impact on performance\nApple suggests: \n\nFileVault 2 encrypts and decrypts your data on the fly with an imperceptible performance impact.\n\n— page cached 2011-07-28.\nAnandTech — Back to the Mac: OS X 10.7 Lion review: FileVault performance observes: \n\n… Overall the hit on pure I/O performance is in the 20 - 30% range. It's noticeable but not big enough to outweigh the benefits of full disk encryption. …\n\nI'd like the AnandTech reviewers to weigh things again more broadly, to include at least:\n\n\n*\n\n*FileVault 1 in lieu of FileVault 2.\n\n\nMore observations on CPU, kernel_task et cetera in Re: [Fed-Talk] Lion FileVault (2011-07-22) (highlights). \n\nA: By combining FileVault 2 with FileVault 1, you can have double layer security. Note that this is will cause troubles with TimeMachine and sharing. Therefore, this double layer security is only advisable for an account where TimeMachine is turned off!\nOn my computer, I have an everyday work account, a FileVault 1 account (excluded from TimeMachine) and an administrator account. When I activated FileVault 2 from my everyday work account (using the administrator account's password), I expected FileVault 1 to disappear because Apple says at OS X Lion: About FileVault 2: «If you turn off Legacy FileVault, the Legacy FileVault tab will disappear and you can then choose to enable OS X Lion's FileVault 2».\nWhen FileVault 2 was all set up, I was very surprised that my FileVault 1 continued having FileVault 1 encryption. So I had a double layer security: A legacy FileVault 1 account within a FileVault 2 computer. All I needed was a non-FileVault 1 account from where to turn on FileVault 2.\nEventually, I turned off FileVault 2 again. I like being able to access the OS X filesystem from the Bootcamp Windows system. With FileVault 2, that was no longer possible. I still keep the FileVault 1 account and it continues working fine, even in 10.8.1.\n", "Q: Where did my file /etc/ppp/ip-up go after upgrading to Lion?

I tried the following with no success:\n\n\n*\n\n*changed the extension on the url from .ars to .html but that didn't work\n\n*Installed Readability's Safari extension but I couldn't get it to work to with any page so it might be broken in Safari 5.1\n\n*Saved it to Instapaper but it only saved the first page.\n\n\nApparently Ars Technica thinks Safari reader is a \"evil genius\" plan from Apple but I think this theAppleBlog post sums up the issue fairly well.\nI understand that well written long form articles take more time to write but I don't think breaking an article up into multiple pages is the answer. I know I can pay Ars Technica $5 a month to remove ads but I only ever read their Apple software and hardware reviews and Apple doesn't release new hardware or software every month. I just want a free 'lean back' reading experience. How about add more ads for longer articles?\nAnyways I know this isn't a discussion forum so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to use Safari Reader on blocked sites for free?\n\n*If not is there any other service that provides a free 'lean back' experience for these blocked sites?\n\nA: I have heard that readitlater works to assemble the full article whether you have paid for it or not.\nI just went to the Introduction page in Safari 5.1 and reader is already to page 15. I'm not going to let it finish, but it doesn't look like it's blocked to me. I haven't paid yet - so something might be up in terms of server overload if reader isn't working for you.\nThe author of Instapaper did mention this specifically in his last podcast that it was quite possible technically for instapaper to scrape the whole article. The gist I recall is he didn't want to cross the line of bypassing ARS' intent since ARS has clearly decided to offer single page view as a benefit to their subscribers. \nHe urged people to spend the $5 for a month's access if they wanted the whole article to load in instapaper for later reading.\nMy take is that many of the services actually made sure their tools would not parse the whole article out of respect for a journal as well as an author that penned 27,000 words. \n", "Q: How can I resize a partition with Disk Utility? I have 2 partitions, I reduced the size of one and want to expand the other to fill the now available space. \nHow do I expand the Lion Partition into the empty grey space beneath Macintosh HD partition?\n\n\nA: I had the same problem too.  I had upgraded Snow Leopard to Lion, but then found out some of my apps would not run in Lion.  So i created another partition and installed Snow Leopard on it so I could dual boot between Lion and Snow Leopard.  The problem was that I didn't leave enough room on my Lion partition to work with some video editing I was doing.  So I tried to enlarge my Lion partition and reduce my Snow Leopar partition but had no success.\nI thought that if I deleted my Snow Leopard partition that I would be able to resize my Lion partition to use the entire drive.  That didn't work.\nSo I tried to boot from the Lion Recovery Partition, but when I tried to apply the changes of resizing my Lion partition it would fail withe a message that it couldn't unmount the drive.\nBut here is what I did that FINALLY worked (and this was while booted into my normal Lion partition):\n- Enter the following command into Terminal\ndefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1\n\n- Open Disk Utility\n\n- Now there is a DEBUG menu at the top.  Go DEBUG and select SHOW EVERY PARTITION\n\n- Now you will see the RECOVERY HD partition under your LION partition.\n\n- Select the RECOVERY HD partition and click MOUNT at the top\n\n- Now you can expand your LION partition\n\nMy guess is that since Disk Utility couldn't see the hidden recovery partition and since that partition is physically AFTER the Lion partition it could not resize.  But by mounting the hidden Recover Partition, then Disk Utility was able to move the Recovery Partition and expand the Lion partition.\nNow I just need to create a partian to reinstall snow leopard into ( I will make it smaller this time so I have more room on my Lion partition).\nHope this helps.\nAnd here's a link to the article I used to find out how to show the hidden partion:\nHere\n\nA: You can't change where each partition starts (i.e. where the top of it is in the partition diagram), only where it ends.  But in your case, since you have a free block as large as the partition you want to change, you can work around it (warning, this is untested under Lion, so make sure you have a good backup first):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new volume in the blank space between your two existing partitions. Give it a distinctive name (you won't want to mix it up with either of your current partitions).\n\n*Boot from the Lion restore partition (boot with the option key held down, and select Recovery HD from the icon list and then click on the arrow under it).\n\n*Run Disk Utility.\n\n*Select one of the volumes in the sidebar, then the Restore tab on the right.\n\n*Drag Lion Partition into the Source field, and the new blank partition into the Destination field. Do not get them backwards!\n\n*Click Restore, and wait for it to clone the partition's contents.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility, then choose Startup Disk from the Apple menu.\n\n*Select the new partition (it may be difficult to tell it from the original, as they're now both named \"Lion Partition\").\n\n*Reboot, and verify that everything is working right before proceeding.\n\n*Run Disk Utility, delete the original Lion Partition and expand the new one into the newly freed space.\n\n\nA: Tried this out and it worked... almost.  Only glitch is that the Lion Recovery Partition (Hidden) which gets copied to the new Lion partition is still on the original Lion Partition.  As a result, Disk Utility will not delete the old Lion partition and you can't merge it with the new one.  I found a solution on OSXdaily.\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/06/30/deleting-the-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-recovery-hd-partition/\nYou have to use diskutil from the terminal window to remove the old Recovery partition.  Then you can go back into the GUI for disk utility and merge the old with the new to recapture the space.\n\nA: If any of you happen to have had a Bootcamp partition and some unpartitioned space, you can use the Bootcamp assistant to delete the Windows partition and it will automatically expand your OSX partition to fill up all of the space on your drive, effectively getting rid of the unpartitioned space. I tried simply expanding my OSX partition as described above but with no luck. \n", "Q: How can I get ALT+C to work via SSH on a remote UNIX machine? I've installed Snow Leopard 10.6 a while a go and I'm pretty new to MacOS. \nI was working on Windows, then started using Slackware and I'm used to working with those OS. \nSo now after I migrated to MacOS I have a few issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm usually administrating a lot of unix servers. My problem is I can't get some of the key features like Alt+C shortcut key to work in mc. What are the alternative keys or workarounds ?\n\n*When I'm in mc or in the terminal, if I press Page up/Page down the terminal scrolls up/down. In normal unix terminals this would actually go to the first command of your command history list. And the page down will go to the last command.\n\n*Globally in Mac you have to use MacKey + Left/Right to go to the beginning of the line or the end of the line. In Windows/Unix OS that's done when you hit Home/End keys. How could that be done in MacOS ? \n\n\nI'm kind of new to MacOS so please be more specific so I could at least google it properly :)\n\nA: When running the Terminal app, choose Terminal > Preferences... \nThis will bring up an options menu. Under Settings there's a tab for the keyboard.\nThe checkbox \"Use option as a meta key\" makes the Alt/Option key work like you expected (I tried it in Emacs and it worked).\nFor Page Up and Page Down, hold down shift to send Page Up and Page Down instead of scrolling. You can also adjust this in the keyboard preferences if you prefer.\nI'm not sure about Home and End, but I'm in the habit of using Ctrl+A for home and Ctrl+E for end.\n\nA: I would recommend iTerm2 - It's a great terminal app and has this option to bind Left/Right option to meta (or esc+ sequence). Home and End work also as expected.\n", "Q: How to make special French keyboard characters work in MS RDC? I'm on a Macbook Pro with a French Keyboard. Keyboard layout works fine when connecting to Windows XP Professional but I cannot get certain keys to work:\nFor example $, &, é, § and @ etc. work fine.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Forward slash / using ⇧ + : works.\n\n*Backslash \\ using ⌥ + ⇧ + : does not work.\n\n*Pipe | using ⌥ + ⇧ + L does not work. \nIs there any configuration that I can do to make my keyboard work?\nI've had this issue on my Windows VM in Virtual Box but fixed it with a custom keyboard layout. However when connecting to servers and workstations over the network this is not a solution since I can not configure each machine I need to connect to.\nUnder preferences, if I disable the Alt key it still does not work and on-top of that working without an Alt Key in Windows is no fun.\n\nA: In windows symbols can be inserted by pressing Shift + relevant number key to insert symbol.\nWhen using a macbook on Microsoft Remote Desktop connection, you are required to Hold down Cmd + Shift + Number Key.  \nThis is the hidden option for inserting symbols into Windows machines over Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection.  \n\nA: In the case of backslash \\, the problem is a difference between where Macintosh French keyboards put the backslash (which is ⌥+⇧+:), and where Windows French keyboards put the backslash (which is ctrl+⌥+8).\nSince the way Remote Desktop works is that scancodes, not characters, are sent to the remote system, you have to honor the Windows keyboard and press ctrl+⌥+8 to get a backslash.\nPipe | is ctrl+⌥+6\nI was able to debug this using the on-screen keyboards, which both Macintosh and Windows support.\n\nA: I press left ctrl + right ⌘ + right ⌥ key on my mac to imitate AltGr when using remote desktop to a windows computer\nI can type special characters and shortcuts that need the AltGr key on the remote PC.\n", "Q: How can I remove a folder that no longer exists from my Finder sidebar in Lion? There is a folder in my favorites in the sidebar of the finder on my Mac. That folder no longer exists, but for some reason it started showing up again as soon as I upgraded to Lion\nWhen I right-click to delete the folder, nothing happens. Normally, for most folders, I see a \"Remove from Sidebar\" option, but alas, I do not for this folder.\nDoes anyone know a way to edit this list from the terminal? Has anyone else experienced this problem and found a solution?\n\nA: This is how you do as described here:\n\nTo remove something from the Finder sidebar, hold Command as you drag\n  it out.\n\n\nA: I was having the same issue and here's what just worked for me:\nHold command, then drag it off the Favorites bar.  The item will turn into a little \"poof\" white cloud and when you release, it'll go away! Finally!\n\nA: All you have to do is click with 2 fingers on your trackpad or ctrl+click on the item and 'remove from sidebar'. \n\nA: If the CMD+Option drag doesn't work (Pre 10.6.7 and all 10.5 for example), I suggest re-creating the same filename in it's same location (if you remember) then deleting the sidebar item, then re-deleting the folder... this was much easier to explain to a non-technical user than modifying the .plists\nLater versions of 10.6 and all 10.7 allow the cmd-option drag, so that's the easiest if it works.\n", "Q: Which text editors take advantage of Lion's Versions feature? I've been a fervent user of Textmate for many a year, and I hope to continue to be one. However, the versions feature of OSX seems like a great and easy to use idea.\nI'm mostly doing HTML, CSS and PHP, and I am a solo developer. Admittedly, I probably haven't spent enough time trying to work it in, but I've never managed to fit SVN or git into my workflow. However, I recognise their potential usefulness.\nSo, are there any lightweight text editors suitable for web designers/developers that work with Versions?\nUseful features would include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Syntax highlighting\n\n*A project view/sidebar\n\n*Auto-indent\n\n\nA: TexShop, the Latex editor, now supports Lion versions. It is not a general Text Editor but can be used as such and supports many of the features you requested.\nhttp://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/lion.html\n\nA: Aptana is geared towards web development (html, javascript, css, php, ...) . It's based on Eclipse, which has build-in automatic version history, so I guess Aptana has it too. \nUsing the version feature (to either replace or compare the current version) is as easy as right-clicking a file (see image)\n\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's free\n\n*has syntax highlighting, sidebar, auto-indent and many more.\n\n*cross-platform (should you ever switch)\n\n\nPossible cons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Probably not using Lion's versioning\n\n*Not exactly lightweight\n\n*Really targeted for  web development, so less of a general text editor.\n\n\nA: Chocolat\nReally promising upcoming editor with super slick look, impressive features and a TextMate-like bundle system.\nLion features (enabled in preferences):\n\n\n*\n\n*Full screen\n\n*Versions\n\n*Autosave\n\n\nCurrently in public alpha.\n\nA: TextEdit comes with Lion so it should incorporate Versions, if you use TextEdit make sure you save with the correct file format (Especially if you want to open the files on windows)\n\nA: The only one I'm aware of right now is Smultron on the Mac App Store. Here's the developers page about the app http://www.peterborgapps.com/smultron/\n\nA: NeoOffice\n\nNeoOffice 3.2.1 Beta adds Apple's new Versions, Full-Screen mode, and Resume features for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion users\n\nWhilst text editing is within the feature set of NeoOffice, I don't know whether it's ideal for web development. \nI do regularly use NeoOffice for editing HTML, but do not imagine that it's compliant with any particular set of standards relating to HTML or HTML5.\n\nA: Taco HTML Edit is designed to simplify the process of creating attractive web sites that render correctly in various browsers. \nTaco HTML Edit includes tag wizards, which generate HTML markup for you. \nTaco HTML Edit also helps find errors in your HTML markup, and it can even check spelling in your documents. \nFor those people who use PHP scripts in their development, Taco HTML Edit includes tools for PHP management.\nOS X Lion Features\nFor OS X Lion users, Taco HTML Edit has support for Autosave, Resume, Versions, and Full Screen.\n\nA: I strongly recommend avoiding opening any kind of markup in TextEdit (programming languages might be okay, though it's still a lousy tool for the job). It tries to display .html files as rich text, which implicitly turns the document into an RTF (silent conversion). If you then try to convert it to plain text, hoping it'll let you see the markup, you'll be disappointed to discover it just converts the RTF into plain text. At that point, if you decide to 'undo' that, the .rtf file will now silently replace your original .html file, which is now permanently destroyed. Hope you have a backup in Time Machine or elsewhere, because you're not getting it back through the built-in versioning system. (At least, this is how it works in Mountain Lion (10.8.1). I'm decribing the exact scenario I just went through when trying to use TextEdit to see older versions of a document, since BBEdit doesn't support Lion / Mountain Lion's versioning system.)\nThere is actually a setting that makes TextEdit usable for viewing HTML documents. In the preferences, under \"Open and Save\", make sure \"Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text\" is checked. Once you've done that, the issue I just described won't occur. The problem is that it's off by default, which is why I feel it's safer to just avoid TextEdit altogether.\n", "Q: How can I make Vuze work with Lion?

Today, Apple updated Safari to 5.1 (6534.50).\nIn Safari 5.0 or below it's very easy to disable opening pdfs inline, you simply say\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitOmitPDFSupport -bool YES\nand it never bothers you again.\nIn Safari 5.1 this no longer works. Does anyone know an alternative to prevent Safari 5.1 opening PDFs in the browser rather than as a download and then in Preview?\n\nA: I don't know of any way to disable inline PDF viewing, but option-clicking on a link will force a download instead. Not exactly what you asked for, though...\nWhat's interesting is that some PDFs actually get downloaded instead of previewed, so that could be a starting point for a hack: http://www.jbc.org/content/279/1/686.long (click on the link 'Full Text PDF').\n\nA: As cparnot mentions, this doesn't seem to be possible anymore, but you can work around it by option-clicking on PDF links. However, this doesn't always work; sometimes, links are opened with JavaScript code that ignores the option key.\nIn those cases, wait until the PDF's URL appears in the address bar, click into the address bar, hit option-return, and then hit back.

How can I boot safari only in Mac OSX Lion Chrome OS style? I heard that there was a key that one had to hold at startup, which one is it?\n\nA: I finally found the answer to this. There are two types of Guest User mode in Lion:\na) Safari-only mode: This is the default setting if no Guest account is enabled. Therefore to turn this on, go to System Preferences / Users and Groups / Guest User, then uncheck \"Allow guests to log in to this account\". \n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Under \"Login Options\", \"Display login window as:\" must be set to \"List of Users\" or this will not work. \n\n\nb) Snow Leopard-like Guest Account - a full guest account as in previous versions of OS X. This mode is enabled when \"Allow guests to log in to this account\" is checked.\n\nA: It appears the Safari-only mode was not included in the retail build of OS X Lion. \n\nA: Command-R will boot into the recovery partition. Once booted you can launch Safari as described on the feature page.\nThe Recovery HD includes the Safari web browser so you can check your email or \nbrowse the Apple Support site.\n\nSource: http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#lionrecovery\n\nA: Not yet. It is a part of Find My Mac, which is a part of iCloud. \nOnce Find My Mac is enabled & a user account is logged in, but at the login screen, you have the option to boot to Safari-Only mode. Once iCloud is released, it should be available (unless, of course, Apple decides to remove it), but not something you'd really want to do. \n\nA: Noah has it right, it is currently part of iCloud, and unless you have downloaded and installed the iCloud beta software, and signed in with an iCloud ID, AND turned on back to my mac in the preferences area for iCloud, it will not appear as an option.\n", "Q: How can I disable animation when switching desktops in Lion? I would very much like to disable the sliding animation that occurs when switching desktops via ctrl+→/← or ctrl+[number] in Lion.   This was previously accomplished in previous versions with this command:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-swoosh-animation-off -bool YES && killall Dock\n\nThis new animation is even more slow than in Snow Leopard - nearly 1 second to switch - a real productivity killer.\nAny help greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I've just noticed that doing ctrl+[number] is noticeably faster than ctrl+→/← . \nIt's still animated but it does complete the animation in about half the time.  I'm not sure if that helps but I'll throw that out there.\n\nA: TotalSpaces has an option to disable the animation for changing spaces:\n\nTotalSpaces is still in beta and a bit glitchy though. There's a small delay before changing spaces, and the whole screen seems to move a few pixels horizontally during the transition. Edit: both of those have now been fixed.\n\nA: I posted a bug on Radar#28495374 and here is the response from Apple:\n\nFixed in 10.12.  Go to Accessibility and Turn on Reduce Motion…\nPlease let us know whether the issue is resolved for you by updating your bug report.\n\n\n\nA: I noticed that it is possible to control the speed of the space-change animation when you use the Swipe gesture in OS X Lion.  You can make the spaces change as fast, if not faster, than they did in Snow Leopard by doing a quick three-finger or four-finger swipe to the left or the right.  Of course, it's definitely something to get accostomed to if you've always used ⌘+→/←.\nThis did get me thinking.  Since it seems that changing spaces via arrow keys, number keys, and gestures all perform the same type of animation, there is likely a single system command that all three of these actions map to.  Additionally, since they all perform the animation at a different speed, there must be a parameter that controls the animation speed.  I'm not an OS X developer, so hopefully someone else with a better knowledge of the underlying functionality of OS X would be able to determine what system commands are actually running when the user performs a certain action.\n\nA: I dug deep into the app using GDB but the results were disappointing. I don't think there is a way to do this currently. Here's what I learned:\nFirst you can change the speed of switching into Mission Control (still called Expose in the prefs). To do that just enter this command:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -int 0; killall Dock\n\nAnd to go back to defaults run this command:\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration; killall Dock\n\nSecondly there's a reference in the binary to fps-spaceswitch (frames per second spaceswitch). I messed with this for a while and also tried variations on this such as spaceswitch-animation-duration without luck.\nUnfortunately (at least as of 10.7.1) there does not appear to be a way to change any settings related to this animation.\nI filled a bug for this with Apple. The Radar number is 10073864. I would encourage you to also file the report at https://bugreport.apple.com/. Note in your description that it is a duplicate of the above bug report number to help the support staff categorize and prioritize this bug.\n\nA: Rather than using Spaces, I have found that switching among non-fullscreen apps using the Alfred app is 'instant'. I create a key binding using shift+ctrl plus a letter for each app (e.g. e for Excel, w for Word, etc.). I have been doing this for years and the experience is truly instant.\nIf you put the apps in fullscreen mode, you still get the animation, so you still need to do Accessibility->Reduce Motion. In that case the app switching with Alfred is faster than using ctrl->arrow, but not as instant as it is if you avoid fullscreen.\n", "Q: How can I fix an Install Failed error while installing Lion? I downloaded the new OS X Lion from the App store. I am running the latest Snow Leopard on my 2010 15\" Macbook Pro. During the download, it somehow stopped while I was away from the keyboard. When I returned, I resumed it again, and after download completion, began to install it.\nWhen it rebooted, it began to install Lion, and when it was at the 33 minute mark, it failed.\nSee pictures below:\n\nI got the error message:\n\nInstall Failed\nMac OS X could not be installed on your computer\nMac OS X couldn't be installed, because the disk Macintosh HD is damaged and can't be repaired.\n\n\nI read somewhere that I should put in the original install DVD, and run the Disk Utility to try to verify and repair.\nI put the disc in, booted it, and clicked through past the language selection, but made sure to wait for the top menu bar to appear to get to Disk Utility.

Every restart leads back into the Lion install, which results in these errors. I think many others are having this issue as well.\nI do have my files backed up (not in Time Machine, but manually on an external USB drive).  I don't mind wiping everything (including Bootcamp), but I rather that be a last resort.\nReference:\n\n*\n\n*Install Failed - Disk is damaged on Apple Discussions site.\n\n\nA: I ended up bringing my Macbook Pro into the Apple store. The genius there attached the store's OS X Snow Leopard via USB, and booted from it, and ran the Repair Disk, which gave the same error of an invalid node structure. Since it was still under Apple Care, I got my hard drive replaced and was able to keep the old one.\nWith the new hard drive, it had Snow Leopard on it, and I simply upgraded it to Lion without a problem. I was able to attach the old hard drive via USB, and restore all my files.\nThanks everyone for their help. +1 to everyone.\n\nA: An erase may fix the node structure. Also tools like Drive Genius or Disk warrior - but if you have a backup, it will likely be much faster to just erase the drive.\nThat way you'll know it's OK or if it can't erase itself properly from the boot drive - you can swap out the HD (or whatever repair is appropriate) and then proceed.\nUntil you're ready to bring a tool other than Disk Utility to bear or try an erase - you won't be able to proceed. :-(\nIf it erases fine (without error) - you should be good to go. Just bad luck with the directory structure. If the drive is failing, you'll keep getting those sort of errors that are not recoverable - even during or after an erase attempt.\n\nA: I had exactly the same situation - allegedly damaged hard disk with invalid node structure, on a bootcamp partitioned disk withh endless looping of installs and no route back to Snow Leopard.  Here's what worked for me, courtesy of a very helpful forum user by the name of bart:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from Snow Leopard DVD by holding down Alt after the chimes and selecting the DVD option.\n\n*Run Utilities -> Disk Utility.\n\n*Click on \"Macintosh HD\" and then \"Unmount\".\n\n*Close Disk Utility.\n\n*Run Utilities -> Terminal\n\n*Run the command: fsck_hfs -rf /dev/disk0s2  (Your partition name might be different.)\n\n*Run it again (my disk it turns out had a lot of errors) until it says \"Volume Repair Completed\".\n\n*Close Terminal.\n\n*Run Utilities -> Disk Utility.\n\n*Click on \"Macintosh HD\" and then \"Verify Disk\".\n\n*Verify should come back ok this time.\n\n*Click on \"Macintosh HD\" and then \"Mount\".\n\n*Choose \"OSX 10.6.8\" as your startup disk.\n\n*Reboot, cross fingers.\n\n\nThis got me back into Snow Leopard with the Lion Installation Application still in the Dock ready to run.  I'll do that when I'm a little more confident!\nHope this helps.\n\nA: To just get back to Snow Leopard you shouldn't need to do any of this hocus pocus - \nWhile in the Lion Installer (\"Install Mac OS X\" window) do q of select \"Mac OS X Installer\">quit from the hidden menubar at the top of the screen - You will be presented with a dialogue \"Are you sure you want to quite?\" select \"Choose Startup Disk...\" - select your Snow Leopard disk and click \"Restart...\"\n", "Q: performance of windows in mac os with parallels.? I'm currently using Core i3 + 8gb + intel 510 ssd as my main desktop.\nIf I install a copy of parallels on the following macbook, would it be same as my current setup?\nMacbook: 2011 Macbook pro 13''\nRam: upgraded to 8gb\n\nA: In a nutshell, they could indeed be similar.\nParallels, in and of itself, should run just fine on your Macbook Pro. And, assuming the specs of your Macbook Pro are similar to your desktop (processor and SSD), the performance of your Parallels virtual machine should be similar. That, of course, also assumes that you have the virtual machine specifications the same between both machines (i.e., how much memory you allocate for the virtual machine, etc.).\n\nA: It's unclear (to me) what your new Macbook Pro's configuration is / will be? Does it have the same Intel processor as your current setup? Does it have a solid state drive? \nJust for comparison I have a Macbook Pro 2011 i7, 8 gigabytes RAM, with 128 gig SSD and I run Parallels 6 to allow me to run Windows 7 Enterprise. It work perfectly and I have zero issues moving back and forth between Lion and Windows 7 in Parallels 6.\nMy Windows 7 Enterprise VM has 2 gigabytes or RAM allocated with full Aero Interface options enabled. I run the VM locally (on SSD). \n\nA: In my experience, 8Gb RAM makes the difference.  I'm running Snow Leopard on several 2009 macs and I was often seeing page outs when I had only 4Gb of RAM.  Upgrading to 8Gb drove the page outs to zero.  Switching back and forth between OS's was stutter-free and yielded a much better user experience.\nMy Windows OS is XP but I expect having adequate RAM would improve all virtual machine implementations.  I allocated 3 Gb to the Windows OS.\n", "Q: Will iWork '08 support autosave and versions? Will iWork '08 work support autosave and versions? I really only use iWork like twice a year, and don't feel like buying a new one. \nEDIT: Wait! It supports app resume though! Yay! Does all app support app resume by default?\n\nA: I don't believe iWork '08 will support those features. \n", "Q: Can I change how often Lion's \"Versions\" feature saves files? Is it possible to change Versions' save frequency?\nFor some kind of work, one hour's worth of work is too much to lose!\n\nA: I haven't been experimenting with this for long enough to be an expert yet, but I think you're confusing two semi-separate features: autosave and versions.\nAutosave saves frequently -- in TextEdit, it seems to save after about 30 seconds of inactivity.  But it doesn't save a new version, it just saves the current document state.\nEvery hour and/or every time you explicitly save a version (Command-S), it saves a restorable version -- one that you can revert to if you decide you've made a mistake in editing.  Once saved, the \"version\" does not get updated; you can revert to it, or go into the Browse all Versions interface and copy content from it, but it's essentially frozen.\nAutosave protects you against forgetting to save changes.  Versions protects you against mistaken edits you wish you hadn't made.  They operate on different time scales (and as far as I know, neither has customizable timing).\n\nA: While there is no interface for changing Versions' autosave frequency, you can still press command-S, which now invokes the \"Save A Version\" command. So, you can still save as often as you'd like manually if you're doing lots of work.\n\nA: So, actually, the Versions part is Time Machine renamed, with a little addition: making it possible to force a separate Time Machine backup for a specific file.\nAutosave saves every 5 minutes, or during idle times while working on a document. See HT4753, as linked to by Graham.\nConsidering the misleading \"Each time you open...\" I think Apple refers to the first autosave action after opening a file. I tried this using Textedit and found that if you open a file, make some changes and then close (do not use the explicit \"save a version\" or cmd+s command) the file (or wait a bit) a separate version is being stored, instead of the default overwrite action autosave uses.\nSo it is a little more intelligent about saving a version \"every time you open\" a file. Making changes is necessary. Could have been pointed out in the KB article though.\n", "Q: How can I stop OS X from automatically connecting to an NFS server on startup? I upgraded to Lion today, but was having the same problem on Snow Leopard. When I start up my Mac and login, it automatically connects to an NFS server. I know this because I see the server in Finder in the Shared section. I'm assuming I connected to the server at some point in the past, but I'm not sure how to make it stop connecting now. Where can I look? Even after ejecting the server, it reconnects on the next startup. What can I do to make it stop?\nFurther information - here's what my /etc/auto_home looks like:\n#\n# Automounter map for /home\n#\n+auto_home  # Use directory service\n#\n# Get /home records synthesized from user records\n#\n+/usr/libexec/od_user_homes\n\nAnd running /usr/libexec/od_user_homes produced no output.\nThe mount doesn't show up in Disk Utility or the Directory Utility, and running lsof doesn't show the mount (/CIFS). df does show /CIFS and indicates that the Filesystem is x-browser:\nHere's /etc/auto_master:\n#\n# Automounter master map\n#\n+auto_master        # Use directory service\n/net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid\n/home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder\n/Network/Servers    -fstab\n/-          -static\n\nAnd the output from mount:\n/dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\nmap -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\nx-browser: on /CIFS (nfs)\nlocalhost:/gWMIVnK_1WG9ZzUq0q3qb7 on /Volumes/MobileBackups (mtmfs, nosuid, read-only, nobrowse)\n\n\nA: You may want to consider using the NFS Manager application to help you locate and disable the NFS automount. You should refer to this section of the manual for assistance.\nThe mount name /CIFS and the lack of NFS information indicates you may be running Sharity. Check if it's installed, using Spotlight. If it is, you can find the documentation here.\n\nA: NFS mounts should show up in Disk Utility.  Open Disk Utility.app (In /Applications/Utilities/) and under the File menu select NFS Mounts. Select the URL of the drive that keeps showing up and click the minus button on the lower left corner of the screen to remove it.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with CIFS-mount, x-browser… That happened because I tried Sharity 3 and 'deleted' it by putting the icon in the trash, like Mac users usually do. :) But the program was still installed and put the CIFS icon on the Desktop every day.\nI solved it using the following Terminal command:\nsudo /Library/StartupItems/Sharity3/uninstall\n\n\nA: Check your start up items in system preferences. It might be in there which would be why it keeps auto mounting.\n\nA: save this as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/cifs.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>localhost.CIFS</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/sbin/umount</string>\n        <string>/CIFS</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n(Translation: \"whenever I login, unmount /CIFS\")\nI know it's not an answer, but since several reasonable attempts have been made to figure it out, I thought it might be time to suggest a \"Well at least this way it won't keep annoying you\" alternative.\n\nA: Firstly, does lsof show which files are actually open on the share? Does df actually show a mounted filesystem or is Finder being helpful and pinging an available share and just connecting to see what the share points might be, not actually mounting a true filesystem.\nPerhaps some program you are unaware is causing the mount.\nThere are lots of places you can cause a remote file system to mount - and we're all guessing them one by one (my guess comes in a moment). If you can pinpoint the exact files that are open - you might realize that's where the mount is happening and not have to disable automatic mounts (by disabling the launchd job com.apple.autofsd). One last tack to track down the cause of the mount might be to change the password (or require one) on the share temporarily and see what process throws an error on the mac.\nNow to the guessing part ...\nAutomatic mounts can also be configured in the Users & Groups pane.\nDo check that you haven't set up AutoMounts and several other settings that can cause file systems to be mounted automatically by looking over the Viewing pop up menu as well as perhaps just detaching from any directory servers that could push those mounts onto your mac as a matter of policy.\n\n\n\n\nA: Unless I'm completely misunderstanding your question... can't you just drag the server to the Eject button (trash can)?\n\nA: Your mac is doing this because of cached MCX. It was at some point or it thinks it has or still is bound to a directory server, most probably Open Directory on OS X Server. I will bind it to whatever server you had bound to and do a clean unbind. also check on the server to see if you can see this computer account (you might have to enable the advanced view target icon tab, to be able to search via mac address etc and see hidden accounts)\n\nA: I was having a similar problem, I was seeing three Sharepoint servers show up in the Shared section of my Finder window.  I went to Users & Groups and disabled a Guest User account that was set up on my laptop.  Once I deselected \"Allow guests to log in to this computer\" and \"Allow guests to connect to shared folders\" the problem went away.\n\nA: Long ago, I had used NFS Manager to set up an automount, but after upgrading to Yosemite, the application no longer works properly. However, it displayed my mount and through this article, I was able to locate where the mount was configured. (Like the OP, my automount info was not in /etc/auto_master or any of its supporting files).\nThe supposedly correct way to remove the undesired link:\nsudo dscl\n> cd /Local/Default/mounts\n> ls\nfreenas:/mnt/vol_home/nfs_home.plist\n> read freenas:\\/mnt\\/vol_home\\/nfs_home.plist\n  --various output here showing my configuration --\n> delete freenas:\\/mnt\\/vol_home\\/nfs_home.plist\n  -- failed due to Invalid Path DS Error: -14009 (eDSUnknownNodeName)\n  -- no combination of \\, %2F, or quotes was successful\n\nAnd the apparently less correct, brute-force method (use sudo cp -p to make a backup of the file first if you wish):\nsudo rm /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/mounts/freenas:%2Fmnt%2Fvol_home%2Fnfs_home.plist\n\nYou may be able to avoid reboot via:\nsudo automount -cv\nsudo umount /nas     (whatever your mount point is)\nsudo rmdir /nas\n\nBut it may disallow the umount due to files still being in use.\n", "Q: How do I run an app in Full Screen mode on OS X Lion on my second monitor? How do I get an app to run in Full Screen mode on OS X Lion on my second monitor? It seems to be stuck on my first monitor, and I'd like to move it.\n\nA: At present there is no way you can. I filed a bug on this during the developer previews and it was marked as a duplicate and the duplicate is still open. (rdar://9741058 and rdar://8056880 for the Apple folk)\nMy assumption is that Full Screen mode is designed for single monitor setups and it does work especially well on single small monitor setups (read any MacBook or MacBook Pro).\n\nA: An upgrade to Mountain Lion will resolve the issue as it finally enables using full screen mode on multiple displays.\nYou can \"take an app full screen on either display. Drag the window to the desired display and click the full-screen button.\"\n\nA: This is an excerpt of Apple's AppKit Release Note for Lion regarding full screen apps & multiple desktops.\n\nMultiple Monitors and Full Screen (New since early 2011 seed)\nWe have made some simplifying assumptions for Lion Full Screen\n  behavior on multiple monitors. Multiple monitors are treated as a\n  single unit by Spaces, and therefore are also treated as a single unit\n  in Full Screen. This means that all monitors will be dedicated to\n  windows belonging to the full screen application, and there can be\n  only one primary full screen window visible at a time. A secondary\n  monitor is useful for inspector windows.\nSecondly, because the menu bar is located on the main monitor, the\n  primary full screen window will be located on the main monitor as\n  well. This allows the menu bar, floating toolbar, and full screen\n  window to maintain their interrelationship on the same monitor.\n\nThe full document can be found here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/AppKit/RN-AppKitOlderNotes/index.html#10_7FullScreen\nAccording to this document, your full screen apps will always be shown on your primary monitor, and there is nothing that can be done about it.\n\nA: You can switch which monitor is the \"Primary\" monitor by opening the Displays in Preferences and dragging and dropping the menu bar to your secondary monitor.  That should make fullscreen apps use your other monitor.\n\nA: I find the easiest way to fix this problem when trying to watch Youtube videos fullscreen on my 47\" 1080p TV, was to use Fullscreen Mode in Firefox, as this stays on the 2nd screen.\nie Only the Apple supplied software has the annoying fullscreen bug/feature.\nHope they fix this\n", "Q: Home and End commands in Lion After installing Lion, ⌘ + ← doesn't go to the line start and ⌘ + → doesn't go to the line end.\nAnyone know how to reconfigure this?\n\nA: Coming from Windows I've had a tough time adjusting to the way home and end behaves.

I purchased bought a license of Lion and heard that it supports virtual machine install. \nI want to install Lion into my VirtualBoxVM on Lion on an iMac. How can I do this?\n\nA: 10.7 (Build 11A511) guest in VirtualBox 4.1 greater\nWhilst end user forums are currently limited to Mac OS X Server, not updated for Lion, there is discussion of Lion (not always Lion Server) in that context.\nWith the most recent VirtualBox it is unnecessary to convert disk images; .dmg files are recognised.\nDepending on your approach, you might see:\n\nThis version of Mac OS X is not supported on this platform!\n\n— (example) — I saw that at least once.\nSuggestion A: await media from Apple\nI recommend this most strongly.\nAwait Apple's provision of Lion on a USB thumb drive. It may be something greater than 11A511 and if so, that greatness may be more suitable for use in virtual machines without the need to hack (see caution below).\nSuggestion B: attempt upgrade from Snow Leopard within the virtual machine\nIn the virtual machine: install Snow Leopard then (honouring Apple's license for Snow Leopard as far as possible in this situation) use that installation for nothing other than an immediate upgrade to Lion.

You'll see a data entry box selected, and you can then enter whatever shortcut you'd like. \n\nA: I had the same problem.  No matter where I clicked or how many times, the text box to enter the shortcut never opened.  What did finally work was to click on \"Restore Defaults.\"  This must have cleared away some old setting that was preventing the change, because I was able to add the shortcut for Launchpad without any problem after that.\n\nA: Try apptivate and it's free to add shortcut for any app. \nIf you have a trackpad then you get another chance to do this with gesture, although i'm hurting my fingers to do so.\n\nA: F4 is the standard shortcut for Launchpad for me - was like that automatically...\n", "Q: What is the upper limit of Spaces in Lion? 10.5 and 10.6 limited users to a maximum of 16 spaces. Since Lion's space interface is a single (presumably scrollable) row, is there an upper limit on the number of Spaces?\nYes, I find myself needing more than 16 Spaces, frequently. \n\nA: 16 spaces is still the maximum. (Tested on 10.7)\n", "Q: I just installed Lion, and now I'm hanging on startup. What went wrong? I purchased Lion from the Mac App Store and installed it on my mid-2009-era MacBook Pro. The installation went smoothly and the computer restarted itself on schedule. I heard the startup noise, saw the Apple logo and the spinny thing... and then it turned to this: \n\nI let it hang like that for fifteen minutes or so before I got bored/antsy. I then forced shutdown with the power button and started it back up - same song 'n' dance. It's been doing this for thirty minutes or so now. The machine is hot and whirring away about something, but no progress is being made. It all feels very foreboding. \nDo Not Enter can't be a good thing, but as far as I can Google, there are a bunch of different things it could mean. What do you think, Apple.SE?\n(FTR, I have some experience with software and troubleshooting, but very little with hardware maintenance/repair/fiddling about.)\nUpdate:\nAs far as I can tell from Googling around and from friends' tips, this denotes an issue reading or communicating with the hard drive. I've made a Genius bar appointment for this afternoon and will report any useful information that comes out of that meeting.\nPost-Genius-Visit Update:\nI visited the geniuses today and, long story short, I am getting a new hard drive. They were unable to mount my drive, and Disk Utility was able neither to repair it nor to reformat it. The Genius I spoke to believed that the fact that this happened to my computer immediately after installing Lion is a coincidence, or that the drive was on its last legs and that Lion was the proverbial backbreaking straw, not that the problem was caused specifically by the installation. One of the other Geniuses around also mentioned, though, that he'd seen a few cases like mine today, including the Lion part. Does this sound odd to anyone else? If not, I'll post & accept an answer saying a new HD is the solution - assuming I can install Lion on the new one without it becoming all borked up...\nTo be continued, I suppose.\n\nA: What went wrong was your hard drive is failing. The system cannot find a valid bootable system. You can test this by booting to an external drive (which looks like might have to wait for getting home or to the shop)\nIf the failure is happening fast - you just had bad luck and it would have failed within days no matter what. Get your stuff off and be glad you got things out before the \"house burns to the ground\".\nIf you had a slow failure, then the upgrade could have made things worse. This slow failure can often be made better by zeroing out the whole drive. Bad blocks get marked and for a while, it is reliable. You might buy some months or a year, but it's starting to fail.\n\nDid the technician let you know if she or he felt you had a crisis or a slow issue with the HD?\nAs an analogy, Imagine a large \"house\" made of four decks of cards and lots of levels. If the far left hand side is shakey but you only are adding cards to the right, it might stand for a long time. As soon as you touch the left, down it comes.\nA system upgrade touches everything - and re-writes the core software needed to boot. Your mac just wasn't up to having critical files written reliably and the upgrade brought those errors to stark light.\n\nPut another way, Lion is running on millions of macs. \nSadly for you, something about your mac was different than most and the results quite painful to your productivity. The good news is many are going through the same pain - discovering how fragile HDD/SSD storage can be when a critical file fails to get written correctly.\nI hope you get everything fixed, lose no data and can start enjoying Lion.\n", "Q: No way to disable Mission Control gesture? Not sure if this is a bug or not in OS X Lion. By changing default gesture of mission control to use four fingers, which seems to me doesn't work. It doesn't disable it when I uncheck the gesture option either.\nI miss the space id icon on taskbar and three fingers left swipe for backwards.\n\nA: It is possible to disable the gestures in the preferences. Sometimes a reboot is needed if other things are going wrong, but on most macs the change is immediate.\n", "Q: Are there adapters to use Thunderbolt Display with non-Thunderbolt computers? That Thunderbolt Display looks great. However, if I buy a monitor, it had better work with all my older computers, not just the latest and greatest Thunderbolt Macs. Is there any way I can get DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, or VGA into it?\n\nA: The Apple press release says \"supports DisplayPort for high resolution displays and works with existing adapters for HDMI, DVI and VGA displays\", but this is referring to the Thunderbolt output port (for daisy-chaining). The Thunderbolt Display will not work with a non-Thunderbolt machine without an adapter.\nBut unfortunately now that the they have started shipping them, it has become clear that this does not apply to the input side of the display. As covered in the AnandTech review you can only connect Thunderbolt equipped computers into the Thunderbolt display.\nThat text in Apple's press release is oddly misleading. Because you also cannot connect a second DisplayPort to the Thunderbolt output socket on the display. You can however connect the Thunderbolt output to something like the Promise Pegasus then you can connect a DisplayPort display to the Pegasus. This seems to be a bug in the Thunderbolt Display, which will hopefully be fixed.\nI expect someone could create an adapter that takes in HDMI/DVI, converts it to DisplayPort and outputs it as Thunderbolt. That should allow you to use the display with \"legacy\" formats, but such a thing does not yet exist and would no doubt be fairly expensive if it did.\n\nA: I'm seeing on Apples site that the system requirements are as follows:\nThunderbolt-enabled Mac computer, including MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac\nOS X v10.6.8 or later\nThat means it must be Thunderbolt enabled.\n", "Q: MIssing setting to go back to traditional mouse scroll With OSX Lion, scroll directions have been reversed and I'm looking to get back to the old behavior. On my laptop there is a setting in System Preferences under Mouse to get it back to the way it was.\nOn my desktop this setting is missing!\nIs there another way I can get it so that the scrolling is back to the way it was on all computers pre-Lion?\n\nA: Mouse:\nSystem Preferences +> Mouse =>\nUncheck “Move content in the direction of finger movement when scrolling or navigating”\nTrackpad:\nSystem Preferences => Trackpad => Scroll & Zoom.\nUncheck “Scroll direction: natural”\n It seems depending on your hardware, the Preferences Panel changes. The magic-mouse has different settings then a normal mouse. This is for the settings panel with the mighty-mouse. Your mileage may vary.  \n\nA: Here is how I fixed the issue.\nI have the IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0 and the option did not show up under the Mouse settings. So what I've done was connect my Logitech mouse and clicked the setting to revert the scroll directions.\nNow when I connect my IntelliMouse, I get the desired scroll directions. Kind of annoying that I had to use a different mouse to get the setting but at least its scrolling in the same direction.\n", "Q: Can I assign a gesture to Mission Control on an older MacBook? I have an older MacBook (2006) that I want to use the four finger swipe to enable mission control. It is not the glass trackpad, but it does have two finger scrolling. Is there any way to enable this?\n\nA: You can assign a hot-corner in Mission Control. This replaces the previous Exposé hot-corner.\n\nA: BetterTouchTool lets you assign arbitrary tap/swipe/click gestures to arbitrary commands.\nI don't know if it supports your hardware, though.\n\nA: I don't think multi touch gestures are supported in 2006 models. \nI thought models < 2007 are not Lion compatible? Needs Core 2 Duo, right?\n\nA: One solution is the one I have chosen: Buy a Magic Trackpad.\n\nA: You are limited in almost every way when it comes to using gestures in Snow Leopard on your 2006 MacBook.\nSoftware\nYou cannot launch Mission control without OSX Lion, if you do indeed have a 2006 MacBook (which I also have) you cannot install OSX Lion, as it requires a Dual core 2 Duo as a minimum processor, the 2006 have the Dual Core Duo processor. This cannot be changed easily and will be almost as expensive as buying an older 2nd hand MacBook with a glass trackpad (see my question here) and therfore you cannot use gestures in the same way a MacBook running Lion would do.\nHardware\nThe older MacBook cannot perform gestures due to the hardware. The non glass trackpad, cannot detect finger positions in relativity to each other, whereas the glass ones released in 2008 can.\nThis means that when you are two finger scrolling it detects two fingers moving down the pad, what it cant do is detect 3 fingers swiping accross a screen, or pinching.\nSorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that is one of the reasons (along with iCloud) I bought a new Mac.\n", "Q: Keyboard remapping in Lion? I've used keyremap4macbook for the last few years to turn the right Alt key into a forward delete. Unfortunately, the tool has stopped working in Lion.\nDoes anybody know of a keyboard remapper that already works in Lion?\n\nA: Turns out I had an old version.\nThe new, officially Lion compatible version from the keyremap4macbook homepage works fine.\n", "Q: How can I set a different scrolling direction for mouse and trackpad in Lion? I want to give the new scrolling behavior in Lion a try (both on the built-in as well as on the magic trackpad).\nBut on my Mouse (a Logitech Anywhere MX), I don't want reverse scrolling. In preferences, it seems as if there were two different settings (one in the mouse prefPane, the other in the trackpad prefPane), however changing one always changes the other.\nIs it possible to set this behavior independently?\n\nA: Posting this as a separate answer based on a recommendation.\nAs of version 1.9.3 BetterTouchTool now supports inversing the scroll direction only for normal mice. It works with Sierra. BetterTouchTool is not free but it is very reasonably priced.\nI have noticed the scroll sensitivity is not what I expect when I use BetterTouchTool to reverse mouse scroll direction, so I personally prefer SteerMouse (mentioned in my other answer to this question). To be more specific, for some reason with Better Touch Tool mouse scrolling I have to scroll more than a few \"clicks\" for it to recognize that I have started scrolling, which means I can't easily scroll a small amount.\n\nA: Another (paid) option is SteerMouse. Years ago I bought SteerMouse and haven't had any problems with it. It has worked perfectly for me on Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan, and now Sierra.\nSierra Update: Version 5 of SteerMouse is needed for Sierra support, but it is working fine. (From what I have read here, ScrollReverser is having some issues with Sierra.)\n\nA: Scrollreverser (free app) actually supports configuring the scrolling direction for each kind of device separately.\n\nA: Adding one more answer for a newer product I just came across, namely Mos (source code here). I have not used this one personally, but I have seen it mentioned. It is free.\n\nA: No\nCurrently in Lion the preference for reverse scrolling sets the direction for both mice and trackpads.\nIf you want to switch directions quickly you might look into Scrollreverser which puts the option in the menubar.\n\nA: I found this thread when looking for help on getting the wonderful Scroll Reverser running on Catalina.  The author has a note on the website saying that Catalina is causing issues and there is not yet a fix available.  For me, the app would launch and immediately segfault.  The icon for the app would appear for a split second on the menu bar and then disappear.\nI experimented a bit and found a workaround which works for me and might work well for others too.  \nIt involves using the automator tool on MacOS to create an \"application\" which launches Scroll Reverser.  Just one action required which is \"Run Applescript\".  Below is the body of the action.\ndo shell script ¬\n    \"'/Applications/Scroll Reverser.app/Contents/MacOS/Scroll Reverser' \\\\\n        >/dev/null 2>&1 &\"\n\nSo create this automator application, save it into your applications folder with a new name eg. Scroll Reverser Catalina and run it.  \nOn first launch, it will require the user to allow for security & private exceptions in the areas of \"accessibility\" and \"input monitoring\".  After ticking the boxes for Scroll Reverser Catalina in those security & privacy areas, it runs as expected.\n\nA: I recommend using USB Overdrive which is compatible with the latest MacOS Catalina. Reverse the scroll direction by selecting \"down\" on \"scroll up\" and vice versa for \"up\". If you want this setting only for specific mice this is also possible in USB Overdrive.\nFurther you can disable or customize the default MacOS mouse acceleration with USB Overdrive, which I strongly recommend. \n", "Q: Is it safe to upgrade all outdated port when upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion? My Mac running Snow Leopard has several MacPorts based open source software packages installed. Upon the upgrade to Lion, all my ports are listed as outdated. \nIt's safe to upgrade them en masse?\n\nA: macports.org currently says:\n\"Note for Lion users: There is no official release supporting Mac OS X 10.7 yet, but you can test the MacPorts 2.0.0 release candidate if you like.\"\nI usually don't upgrade to a new major version of OS X until MacPorts has released their first official support for it.\nI agree with Jerry Jacobs that you should probably back up your /opt hierarchy before attempting. Then you could try doing sudo port selfupdate to see if that upgrades you from 1.9.2 (or whatever) to the 2.0.0 release candidate.  If it does, then you can try sudo upgrade outdated.\nI wouldn't try doing a sudo upgrade outdated on Lion without at least being on the 2.0.0 release candidate of MacPorts.\n\nA: The best thing you can do is to copy the /opt/local directory to a other directory, and then upgrade everything you installed with macports. If it fails you still have your old ports in the backup directory.\n\nA: I just upgraded to Lion yesterday. Port 1.9 stopped working until I upgraded Xcode to the newest version (4.1). After I upgraded Xcode, port (1.9) started working again.\n", "Q: 3 Terabyte hard drives in Mac Pro Mid 2010? I got the Mid 2010 Single CPU Mac Pro and want to add a 3 TB hard drive, specifically the Western Digital Caviar Green WD30EZRX.\nDoes anyone know if that drive will work? Not looking to boot from it, just need a large data drive and got all 4 bays in use already.\nMac is running OS X Lion and windows 7 64-Bit, so GPT partition scheme is no problem.\n\nA: If it fits the in Sata slot, it works.\n\nA: No issue with 3GB, at 6GB you need a different bracket. The drives are the same size but mounting holes are different.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt -> Triple Monitor Mac Mini? It seems the new Mac Mini uses both HDMI and Thunderbolt, but bandwidth limitations of Thunderbolt may prevent using 3 daisy-chained Thunderbolt high resolution monitors such as the newly released Apple Thunderbolt 27\" Display, limiting you to two instead of three.\nIf this correct:\n1. What occurs to the 3rd monitor in a triple daisy-chain? Black screen? Reduced available resolution up to the bandwidth limit of Thunderbolt?\n2. Are there HDMI to mini-displayport adapters for connecting the HDMI output of the Mini to the Thunderbolt input of an Apple Thunderbolt 27\" Display? Would that even work?  \n\nA: If you get the Mac Mini with the AMD graphics it can support three monitors.\nFrom MacRumors\n\nMac mini (Mid 2011): Two Thunderbolt displays. Mac mini with AMD graphics can support a HDMI compatible device on its HDMI port when using two Thunderbolt displays. \n\n\nA: The limitation is not in the Thunderbolt, but in your graphic card.\nI believe the third display will have a black screen if you don't have enough power from your graphic card.\n\nA: Apple recently posted a knowledge base article on this subject.\nThe bottom line is there is no currently available Mac that can power more than two thunderbolt displays. You may be able to use third-party hardware extensions to increase this number.\n", "Q: Can I use PayPal for non-US iTunes Store payments? Can I use PayPal for non-US iTunes Store payments?\nI've heard US users can do so, but my PayPal and iTunes account are non-US\n\nA: Payment methods vary greatly among the many iTunes stores around the world and are often fit to the local market. In Germany, for example, it's possible to pay via direct-debit, because this is a very common way to pay there. There are iTunes stores (additionally to the US one) which accept PayPal - UK comes to mind. In your case I would check my iTunes account to see whether it is possible to pay via PayPal.\n\nA: One way to pay in foreign stores is to buy gift vouchers (i.e. on ebay) and open a second account with a fake address and use these vouchers.\n", "Q: Why doesn't AirDrop work on older network adapters? Apple has stated that AirDrop will support only the following models:\n\nAirDrop supports the following Mac models:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Late 2008 or newer)\n\n*MacBook Air (Late 2010 or newer)\n\n*MacBook (Late 2008 or newer)\n\n*iMac (Early 2009 or newer)\n\n*Mac mini (Mid 2010 or newer)\n\n*Mac Pro (Early 2009 with AirPort Extreme card, or Mid 2010)\n\n\nI saw mention of more detail on Twitter, but the forced brevity has provided me only limited information from @GlennF (Glenn Fleishman) (here):\n\nAirDrop will require newer Wi-Fi hardware (newer meaning maybe as old as 2008 or 2009) that allows simul. network/ad hoc.\n\nAnd from @NeoVanGoth (\"Sir Neo Codealot\") (here):\n\nWarum #Airdrop aug älteren Macs night geht: \"it appears that the WiFi radio module must support simultaneous dual-band for AD to work\" #Lion\n\nCan I get a more detailed, and hopefully highly technical explanation about the differences in these network adaptors, as well as what it is specifically that the new ones are doing in order to make AirDrop work properly?\n\nA: You can make airdrop run partially if you run this terminal command.\ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser BrowseAllInterfaces 1\nIt will only let you airdrop with other Macs connected to your WIFI network (not other Macs in your vicinity on a different network) but its better than nothing.\nRef: http://www.funkyspacemonkey.com/airdrop-work-older-macs\n\nA: AirDrop depends on specific wireless chipsets and antennas so that the airport card has spare processing capability to talk directly to other macs. AirDrop makes an ad-hoc secure mesh network and doesn't care whether you're joined to any WiFi network. Your existing network traffic is separated from the AirDrop traffic.\nOlder wireless hardware doesn't meet these needs. There are hidden preferences you can turn on in terminal. This doesn't (necessarily) send the files securely - it just lists shared file servers that Finder would normally show in the Network Browsing window / sidebar and draws them in the AirDrop window. You don't get the extra security and freedom of being off-network.\n\ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser BrowseAllInterfaces 1\n\n\nA: Basically what AirDrop does is it turns your Mac into a WiFi access point in the 5 GHz band. That's why it's zero configuration, works whether or not the Macs are in the same wireless network, or in ANY wireless network.\nHowever, to create this second network, the adapter needs to support multiple networks.\nThis also explains why it only works with WiFi and not with e.g. one Mac wired into a base station and the second Mac using WiFi to connect to it.\n\nA: Anyway, why bother with AirDrop?  Enable a Bonjour account in iChat and use that to transfer files.  Works on 10.4 - 10.7, no chipset limitations.\n\"Great new features\" of OS X (latest) are often just slightly dressed up implementations of older concepts.\n\nA: Airdrop is definitely a bit finicky, no ethernet by default and all these hardware requirements.\nI've been using Worml instead, which also lets me send files directly to people outside my network with just a keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: Are you running OSX Lion ? if not then that's your mini's limitation\n\nAirDrop is one of the great new features of Lion that provides a really easy way to share files between supported, Wi-Fi enabled Macs, without having to connect through the local Wi-Fi network.\n\nreference: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4783\nemphasis mine\n", "Q: Show Space/Desktop Number in Mac OS X Lion in Desktop Top Bar In Snow Leopard, it was possible to display the space number in the top right corner of the status bar.\nHow do you do that in Lion with Mission Control?\n\nA: This function was removed by design. Lots of people want this back, so perhaps an add on or secret setting can be discovered later, but for now, the answer is no.\n\nA: TotalSpaces is a good alternative: http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/\nTotalSpaces2 have an icon in menubar, like Spaces in Snow Leopard. More intelligent and more powerful application, as the factory default.

I decided to not upgrade my Mac Pro yet in case I ran into issues.  Turned out to be a wise move, because while things went smoothly for the most part, I did run into a problem that's kind of a show stopper for someone who works in web development.  \nI have CS4 Web Premium installed (Flash, Illustrator, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, etc), and while they all start (splash screen, then application GUI appears), they all become unresponsive immediately and display the beachball.  The only way out is force quitting.  \nI ran Adobe Updater to make sure I had the latest versions, and I seem to be all up to date, but I just can't get any of the CS4 apps to run.  I did read on one forum that a clean install of Lion (Reformat drive, install from burned DVD/Thumb drive) fixed the problem for some users, but not all, and I don't have the time to spare on such a big operation. \nHas anyone managed to get CS4 working on lion?  If so, how?\n\nA: I upgraded to Lion as well last night, and I also have CS4 design premium (Flash, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc) on a MacBook Pro, late 2008 model.\nYou must manually reinstall the Java runtime stuff in order for the programs to open (much software update automatically began installing them after I had restarted. Please see the link:\nADOBE CS4 SUPPORT FORUMS for LION\nHowever, Adobe stated in that article that they probably won't release updates for Lion products in terms of fullscreen functionality, etc, but that those things will be included in newer versions of Adobe. CS5.6 anyone?\n\nA: It seems you have to download the Java installer from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1421 to get CS4 to work, the package that gets installed the first time you try to use a Java app doesn't seem to work for whatever reason.  \nThe CS4 suite still doesn't seem entirely stable under Lion, but oh well, at least it runs at all now.  \n\nA: Restart the system by holding the Option (or \"alt\") key and select the \"Recovery HD\" volume to boot from. You can also do this by booting up while holding the \"Command\" and \"R\" keys.\nWhen you are booted up, choose disc utility and repair disc first and repair permissions second. This worked for me.\n", "Q: Is it possible to reorder spaces in Lion? I would expect 'Mission Control' to allow me to drag spaces in a certain order (with the exception of the 'Dashboard' space), but this does not seem like an option.\nThis would be especially useful when re-ordering full-screen apps: for example, opening iCal and then opening Mail fullscreen would result in Mail being 'spaced' after iCal. But what if I'd want Mail to have a higher 'priority', thus wanting it spaced before iCal?\nIs there an option to re-order spaces without recreating them entirely?\n\nA: I can confirm that this option is in the developer release of the 10.7.2\nI was actually surprised that this wasn't available in the public release of Lion. Oddly enough I just noticed it today when playing around with a friends MacBook Air... I was trying to show him how to use it and I couldn't for the life of me figure out why in the world I wasn't able to grab the spaces and reorder them. What an annoyance. \n\nA: OS X 10.7.2 Update\nSince OS X 10.7.2 Desktops (or Spaces) and full screen apps can be reordered, i.e. spaces can be mixed with full screen apps in any order a user may fancy, but with one exception - Dashboard and Desktop 1 (1st Space) cannot be moved.\n\nPre OS X 1.7.2 answer:\nBased on several reviews and reports you cannot.\nSeems like an oversight to me as I consider it as a must-have feature.\nBe aware there's also something called automatic-ordering (System Preferences > Mission Control > Automatically rearrange Spaces), which apparently orders them based on usage.\n\nA: it seems you've accepted an answer, but here's a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn ON automatic-ordering (System Preferences > Mission Control > Automatically rearrange Spaces)\n\n*Command-Tab through applications on each space until you get the order you want (they will automatically reorder themselves.)\n\n*Turn OFF automatic-ordering.\n\nA: The use of cmd-tab to order the spaces (as suggested above) seems for me at least to work for some apps but not others. Another approach is this.\nTurn the automatic reorder off in Prefs; then note (as above) that the desktops go to the left and the full-screen apps to the right. Then go through the apps one-by-one, for each one turning off full-screen and then back on again. When off'ed, the app will (temporarily) move to Desktop 1; but when re-on'ed, it will get its own space back again --- at the end of the line.\n\nA: System Preferences -> Mission Control --> Uncheck Automatically rearrange Spaces\n", "Q: Where is the F13 button on my MacBook Pro? I was looking through the System Preferences for Mission Control in OS X Lion (10.7). One of the options had F13 in it but I couldn't find it anywhere. \nWhere is it?\n\nA: MacBook's don't have the extended keyboard which contains the additional 7 function keys (F13-F19). They're only on Apple's full size ( with numeric keys) keyboard as presented on this photo:\n\n\nA: Apple laptops don't have function keys higher than F12. \nCertain Apple keyboards do, however.\nWhen using an external IBM/PC keyboard, PrtScn/SysRq, ScrLk and Pause Break should map to F13-F15.\n\nA: You can use Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook) to remap most keys on your keyboard. Particularly I used the option which maps the Eject button to F13 and Fn+Eject to Eject.\nImportant note:\nconsider using a different key than Eject; since it sends KeyDown and KeyUp events at the same time the system will not notice you trying to hold it. Also, it does not send any event until a small delay time has passed, during which you must keep it pressed. This can be very annoying if you are a fast-typing maniac and wish to be able to hit it very quickly. However, delay time is smaller than 0.1 seconds on my keyboard, so you will hardly find it an issue\nAnother useful tip\nIt is also useful if you liked old MacBook Pro keyboards which made a distinction between Return and Enter keys (very useful with Wolfram Mathematica for example) to remap the right option key to Enter. It has loads of other options, you will surely find it suitable for your needs.\n\nA: Use these 3 keys to send an F13:  shift fn F1 \nI used this to send an F13 key to my windows application using Remote Desktop.\n", "Q: What do I need to set up two DVI monitors on a 2011 Mac mini? As a software developer who recently bought an iPhone, I knew it was just a matter of time before I started dicking around in the iOS apps space. Today Apple released a new line of Mac minis and I am going to buy one. I'd like to just buy a KVM switch and flip between my current two monitor PC setup and the Mac. What kind of adapters do I need for the Mac mini to be able to take two DVI outs?\nI've been told that I can use a mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter with the Thunderbolt port then just a HDMI to DVI in the HDMI port, is that possible?\n\nA: \nI've been told that I can use a mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter with the Thunderbolt port then just a HDMI to DVI in the HDMI port, is that possible?\n\nThat's what I do with a 2010 mini (MDP instead of TB). \nYes, it works perfectly.\nThe tricky part comes if you want three monitors. For that, you need to be sure to buy the video-boosted Mini model that has discrete graphics, or use a (slow) USB video adapter for the third screen. But for two, any modern mini is fine out of the box.\n\nA: \nI've been told that I can use a Mini Display Port to DVI adaptor with the thunderbolt port then just a HDMI to DVI in the HDMI port, is that possible?\n\nThis should be theoretically possible. The only other option I can think of is to get a splitter for the thunderbolt port and get 2 dvi adapters. \n\nA: I was just looking into hooking up two displays to my yet to arrive Macbook Air and found a Mini DisplayPort | Thunderbolt to DVI (2 DVI Output) Converter.\nI don't see why this wouldn't work for the Mac mini as well.\n", "Q: Is Mission Control an addition to Exposé & Spaces UI or a replacement? Lion has Mission Control that combines features from both Exposé and Spaces. Do the old Exposé and Spaces UIs still exist in Lion or does Mission Control replace them?\nI've heard mixed rumors about whether Spaces/Exposé exists or not; and all the YouTube et al. videos/reports concentrate on featuring the Mission Control but won't tell straight if it is an addition or a replacement.\nI understand, though, there are spaces—called desktops—on the top of the Mission Control UI.\nThere definitely are spaces, but is there Spaces?\n\nA: Mission Control replaces them.\nAll the things that you used to be able to do in expose and spaces should be in Mission Control as well (Well... Not really, you can't have spaces arranged in two dimensional space anymore).\nBut no, there's no more Spaces or Expose anymore.

Should wait a bit for spotlight indexing, and don't plug in time machine drive while spotlight index!\n\nA: All of the press / industry coverage is focusing on the huge usability changes (and that mirrors the marketing that Apple is doing).\nSome notable exceptions are the new Safari which runs some benchmarks like web app and JavaScript significantly faster.\nThe major changes under the hood speak more to security, sandboxing and plumbing the new multi-touch interface, encryption, auto save, auto revisions rather than speed.\nIt is too soon to tell if speed is much better, but once people adapt to the changes, the idea is we will be much more efficient with the computer waiting for us less than the other way around. I would expect your experience with the hardware you mentioned to be a minor speedup in pure numbers but a major speedup as your brain becomes free from worrying about saving, window management and revisions (assuming you adapt to the changes and like them)\nI get the feeling that with mission control and full screen apps, that the UI is incredibly fluid and optimized but I'm running on some faster macs than yours.\nFun times, huh?\n\nA: I have definitely noticed an increase in the speed of safari and Xcode, and this article seems to confirm that others have had the same experience. Also, everyone else that I have spoken to has noticed a speed boost as well in many applications. This discussion also proves that isn't just me and select friends: \nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/archive/index.php/t-1168519.html\nThough I cannot cite any numerical proof, it is noticeably faster for me.\n\nA: I have a MacBook with exactly that configuration. Lion is de-facto faster in some areas (World of Warcraft, for instance, runs 10-15 frames faster), but may \"feel\" slower in others (e.g. opening a window sports a new animation and gives the impression that it's delayed a bit). This \"feeling\" is of course not specific to that machine. Anyway, Lion is certainly not slower than Snow Leopard on a Late 2008 MacBook.\n\nA: I have a 2011 quad-core i7 15\" MacBook Pro with 8G RAM, and Lion is noticeably faster than Snow Leopard in all areas.\n", "Q: Safari reopens last open tabs? On Lion, if I quit Safari using  ⌘ Command+Q and then restart it, it reopens all tabs from last time.\nIn Preferences, I have set that new Windows open with an Empty Page, a setting that worked fine in Snow Leopard.\nIs there a way to disable that nonsense? I can't seem to find a setting for this :(\n\nA: In case you didn't have the foresight to shut down with a special command, you can always hold down Shift when starting Safari (or any other Resume-able app) to prevent it from restoring the previous state.\n\nA: In addition to the great ⌥ Option+⌘ Command+Q tip, another way to think about it: If you always close all your tabs (⌘ Command+W) before you quit, there won't be any state to save. Then when you restart Safari, you'll get your preference of a blank page, home page, etc.\n\nA: This is a new feature in Mac OS X Lion. See here (Resume).\nYou can disable this in System Preferences > General and untick the \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps, but will be system wide.\nAnother solution is to hold ⌥ Option+⌘ Command+Q when quitting,  the app will then not save the state.\n\nA: Note that as per this other answer to a similar question, is is actually possible to disable resume on a per-app basis, forcing Safari to start with a new window and as such take your 'empty page' preference into account.\n", "Q: Constantly ejecting OS X install disc when trying to boot When trying to boot from the OS X install disc (Snow Leopard) my Macbook will just eject the disc and boot normally from the installed system on the hard drive.\nOnce booted, the disc can be read fine by the computer, but when trying to restart in order to make a fresh install of the operating system, the computer will just again eject the CD and boot from the hard drive.\nHolding the C key when during startup to force booting from the CD drive wont work, and the CD is ejected again. Even holding the ⌥ (alt or option) symbol during startup will cause the CD to be ejected, and the only boot option shown is the hard drive.\n(Note, as I've found threads with similar questions elsewhere on the internet, all with long discussions but none with an answer, I'm documenting here the solution that worked for me.)\n\nA: Restart the computer, then press and hold the ⌥ key just after you hear the startup chime. Even if the install disc is ejected, and you are only shown the hard drive as your unique boot option, at this moment you can again insert the disc, and wait for the computer to read it. If everything goes fine, you will now see the option to boot from the CD.\n\nA: I shut down the computer, unplugged anything that was attached to it (peripherals, power cord, etc.), held down the power button for more than 10 seconds, plugged power cord, keyboard and mouse, turned the computer back on, waited for main screen, and inserted DVD.

I purchased and downloaded Lion yesterday. As always when there's a major release, I like to keep things clean as I have a huge tendency to fiddle with the system once installed and that might render future updates instable, so I'm going the full reformat-then-install route.\nWell, so I \"burned\" InstallESD.dmg onto a reliable 8Gb USB thumb drive with Disc Utility. I just reformated and reinstalled my mid-2009 17\" MacBook Pro, from which I'm writing this right now. Flawless install, nothing to say.\nThen the problem arises : I've got two other machines, a 2008 white (plastic) 13\" MacBook, and a 2008 MacPro. When I boot them from the USB drive by holding Alt, the kernel starts then halts with a \"no go\" sign. Booting the USB installer drive into Verbose mode tells me that's it's \"still waiting for root device\", whichever USB port I use on the MacBook or the Mac Pro.\nI am just looking to get Lion installed several clean / erased macs while avoiding another download of the Lion package each time I start an install.\nWhat should I do? \n\n\n*\n\n*Try another USB drive. \n\n*Burn the .dmg to an optical disc? (haven't touched one in... well... ages). \n\n*Reinstall a fresh Snow Leopard on them, then perform the latest Software Updates, then install Lion the \"official\" way?\n\n\nThanks for any tips.\n\nA: It sounds like the USB drive doesn't have the drivers to boot the other macs. :-(\nThe fastest path forward is to simply erase install a basic Snow Leopard OS onto the failed macs. While this is happening, do download the 10.6.8 Combo update to your USB drive just in case it's needed. \nDon't bother running the updates unless the Lion installer forces you to get to a higher version than your 10.6 installer delivered.\nOnce you boot into Snow Leopard - you can try again to mount the USB and execute the Lion upgrade package. I don't know if it runs well from the USB or needs to be copied to the internal boot drive.\nThere's a little uncertainty in my brain - so I don't want to write too much without making sure this makes sense to you.\n\nAs an alternative - you could try instead to transfer the recovery partition, but this may not be universal (include the drivers the older macs) either.\nThere is a step-by-step recipe here for copying any bootable volume to one file on a USB drive.\nIf you are curious or feel it's worth a shot, image the recovery partition from your Lion mac.\nYou should be able to boot from DVD and use disk utility to make an equivalent partition on the \"non bootable\" mac and drop the recovery data to get a minimal bootable system and avoid a full Snow Leopard install.\nUnless you are familiar with Disk Utility and the steps to capture, the reinstall option might be more likely to succeed on first attempt. I certainly don't know if this partition is customized by Lion and not universal so I've made it an aside for the curious.\n\n\nA: Just to be safe, I would just reinstall Snow Leopard on your computers (Why would you even have to do that? Booting from USB wouldn't affect Snow Leopard, would it?) and then install Lion the traditional way. It doesn't cost any extra money, for any of your computers registered with your account on the Mac app store get Lion free. \n", "Q: Package command line tools into an automator script or app? I'd like to know if there's a way I could package compiled command line tools together as part of an automator script or an app. \nLet's say, for example, I want to use a command line tool called foo and this relies on jpeglib and a few other libs. Am I able to put them in the same folder and somehow pipe this new $PATH to the foo app?\nThe reason I want to do this is that a client requires something that I usually use a bash script for. In order for them to do the same thing they'd need to installed XCode (to get the gcc compiler) and install the command line tools (through macports, fink, etc...) and of course that's hassle.\n\nA: All macs have several shells available (GNU bash 3.2.48 ships with the latest Snow Leopard) including zsh, sh, bash, csh and ksh. You can safely embed one or more shell scripts without fear that other macs won't have the tools to run your program.\nThe simplest thing to do would be to just embed a functioning shell script in an AppleScript or Automator workflow. Both handle piping arguments or file paths to stdin/stdout so you can interact with the script if desired.\nThe site Mac OS X Automation has some great tutorials to get you started if this makes sense to solve your issue.\nAlso, if you are looking for a tool to package your bash script and an automator/applescript document in one nice unit - the package maker application is available for free as part of the iPhone Configuration utility. It's more work, but will make any mac user more comfortable installing your tool.\nFor an open source option that is amazing - try Platypus - http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus/\n\nA: If you are looking to install some common command line tools which are not included in Mac OS X, you might have some success in the Rudix program, which offers pre-compiled versions of many utilities in a ready-to-install DMG/pkg format.\nRudix: The hassle-free way to get Unix programs on Mac OS X\n", "Q: Is the OS X Lion clean installation less stable than the upgrade install? I upgraded to OS X Lion yesterday, everything went fine and I used it for the day without crashes or problems. In the evening, I decided to burn myself a DVD from the installer, and I did a clean install. Am I the only one to notice that the OS X Lion clean install is buggier than the upgrade? Why is that?\nExamples of \"buggier\":\n\n\n*\n\n*I wasn't able to finish the initial user account set up. At the moment of taking a picture of myself for my account, I got away from my computer 10 minutes, it seemed to go on sleep, and it never woke up. \n\n*After that, on the login screen, I entered my pwd, pressed ok, and the wait cursor showed up. I let it spin for 10 minutes, then got tired of it and restarted the computer.\n\n*Finally, this morning, after my computer woke from sleep mode, the mail full screen application froze on an administrator login screen.\n\n\n--EDIT--\nAfter a couple of weeks of using Lion, everything goes smoothly. The issues I had have gone away automatically.\n\nA: The DVD install is not an official, sanctioned by Apple, way to install the OS. So it's not that surprising that thing don't go as smoothly.  \nOr maybe it's just bad luck when burning or installing the OS. So you can try to install it once again, even burning another DVD to see if that was the problem.\nIf you want to do a clean install, there will be official USB key in August. But they'll cost more that two times the price of Lion on the Mac App Store\n\nA: I have it on good authority that all Lion installs are a standard install followed by a migration of data (local, remote or Time Machine based) so as long as you are following the official steps, having less to migrate will only be more buggy if you add that \"bad data\" once the install has finished.\nIf the software installed poorly, the same software should have the same bugs boot after boot after boot. Can you reproduce any of these issues? It sure sounds like a hardware (RAM or HDD) issue instead of some bug in the installer. The only way to know is to clean install Snow Leopard or dig into the specifics. I don't think enough people have run the installer in the DVD manner you mentioned for any \"word on the street reports\" to be useful.\nSorry I don't have a better idea other than going through the usual issue isolation steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Isolating issues in Mac OS X\n\n*Mac OS X: How to troubleshoot a software issue\n", "Q: Can I change the behavior of the Home and End keys on an Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad?

Say in \"Pages\", the home key doesn't bring the cursor to the beginning of the line, while the end key takes you to the bottom of the page.  \nDoes anyone know how to re-map the home/end key?\n\nA: One option is to create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n  \"\\UF729\"  = moveToBeginningOfLine:;\n  \"\\UF72B\"  = moveToEndOfLine:;\n  \"$\\UF729\" = moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:;\n  \"$\\UF72B\" = moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:;\n}\n\nQuit and reopen applications to apply the changes. Note that DefaultKeyBinding.dict is not supported by some applications like Xcode or Firefox.\nIn Terminal you can assign home (↖) to control-a and end (↘) to control-e from Preferences > Settings > Keyboard. That will leave you with no key combinations to scroll to the top or bottom of a window though.\nIt might be easier to just use the default keybindings.

Would it be possible to connect a thunderbolt display and a DVI display to the new thunderbolt MacBook Air? The Apple website has images of a Pro with multiple external monitors, but an Air with only one. Is it possible to do this? Or is the MacBook Air not powerful enough?\nI know this is technically possible, by connecting the Air to the thunderbolt display and then connecting the DVI display to the thunderbolt display (with an adaptor), but will the MacBook Air be powerful enough?\n[The DVI monitor is a standard 22\" Dell monitor]\n\nA: Not using the built-in hardware. Only MacBooks with a discrete graphics card can drive a second external display (and even then, only one of the new Thunderbolt displays).\nThe MacBook Air doesn't have a discrete graphics card, only the Intel HD 3000 one that comes with the CPU. The same applies to the MacBook Pro 13 inch and the 15 inch ones that don't have one of the AMD Radeon graphics cards.\nYou can drive an external display using a USB connected graphics card. For example I have one of the DisplayLink adapters, which works very well for everything except 3D graphics and full screen video).

I've also set up the Mac Pro as a Lion Server.  I've set up a few AFP shares on the Mac Pro & I notice there's no \"Time Machine Destination\" option on the shares.  I know this option was there on Snow Leopard.  When I connect to the shares on the MacBook Pro, they do not show up as backup disks in the Time Machine preference pane.  Is it possible to do this anymore?\n\nA: Have you set it up like the Lion Server Administration article quoted below?\nTime Machine service offers a backup destination on your server to Time Machine users. Use the Time Machine pane of the Server app to make server disk space available for backing up users’ computers, or to change the disk used for storing user backups.  \nTime Machine service is available to users with Mac OS X Lion, Snow Leopard, and Leopard. Mac OS X Lion and Snow Leopard users who haven’t selected a backup disk in the Time Machine pane of System Preferences are automatically asked whether they want to use the server as a storage location. Other users need to open the Time Machine pane of System Preferences and change the backup disk.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Server app sidebar, select Time Machine.\n\n*Click the On/Off switch to turn on Time Machine service.\n\n*Select a disk to use as the destination for users’ backups, and then click Use for Backup.\n\n*Time Machine service creates the Backups shared folder on the disk you select.\n\n\n\nTo choose a different disk as the backup destination, click Edit.\nIf you turn on Time Machine service when file sharing service is off, file sharing service turns on automatically.\nIf you change the backup disk, users’ Time Machine preferences that were set to use the server for backup storage will automatically begin using the Backups folder in its new location.\nAfter selecting a different backup disk, advise users that their first backup will take longer because it’s a full backup. Time Machine service doesn’t copy users’ backup data from the old Backups folder to the new Backups folder.\nYou can control each user’s access to the server’s Time Machine backup storage in the Users pane of the Server app.\n", "Q: I can't delete or reset password on accounts in Snow Leopard I have this strange situation in Mac OS X (10.6.8) wherein 2 accounts cannot be deleted nor can I reset their passwords.\nIf I try to reset their passwords I get \"Reset Password Failed\".

How do I fix this?\n\nA: This is generally really easy to clean up.\nThe Snow Leopard user database for all accounts on the mac is stored as flat files in the directory /private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users\nJust delete the offending userA.plist and userB.plist and the accounts will be \"gone\" after a reboot.\n\n\n*\n\n*boot the mac in target mode and use another mac to delete the files\n\n*boot to single user mode (or get a root shell with sudo -s) if you are comfortable in a unix shell\n\n\nThere will of course be remnants of the user folders and their group membership potentially left lying around.\nIf you are concerned about that level of cleanliness - just boot back into a normal admin user and recreate a shell account using the same short name.\nYou can then correctly reset the password (retaining the home folder) or delete them cleanly and totally at that point. \nLet me know if you still have a failure - it's super unlikely, but there could be a deeper problem if this doesn't work.\n", "Q: How can I rename desktops in Mission Control? The default new desktop space is named 'Desktop 1'. If you create a new one, it is named 'Desktop 2'. Is there a way to change those default names to something more meaningful?\nAdditionally, it looks like you can't rearrange spaces either and the 'automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use' checkbox seems to do nothing.\n\nA: [Update: creator here  - I have pulled this app from the App Store because it's a free app that I currently don't have a great way to test on Monterey, as I don't own hardware that can run it (I have a 2014 MBP). That said, users have emailed me still wanting it, and I have selectively put it in the store every week or two for a short amount of time so they can grab it. If you are interested in knowing when those windows are, shoot me an email via the support tab on the homepage https://currentkey.com through an email or twitter DM. But also, Apple should just go ahead and support named Desktops natively, they're inevitably going to do so eventually - as all other OS platforms do, and it should be sooner rather than later. Thanks!]\nThere's an app (in the Mac App Store) that lets you name Spaces via the menubar.\nIt's different than naming them in Mission Control (they don't show up there), but the names are persistent and the app lets you set a custom icon in the menubar per Space, for a quick visual reference of what Space you're in. Why not in Mission Control? Because macOS public APIs are limited, and this app is delivered via the App Store.\nIt may be what you're looking for. Full disclaimer: I'm the developer of the app, called CurrentKey Stats. It's completely free in the App Store.\nThe app also lets you jump directly to another (named) Space via its dropdown menu or via global hotkeys. B/c Apple lets you have up to 16 Spaces per screen, this is handy in navigating between them.\n\n\nA: It is possible to rename spaces using an app called Spaces Renamer. It is available on GitHub for free. I am unsure if it can change the \"default\" name of desktops as you requested, but it can customize the name of desktops you already have. Please check the below screenshots for an example.\n\nThe compressed view after pressing F3\n\nThe expanded view after hovering\n\nThe interface for renaming the spaces\nImage sources: the GitHub page\nPlease note that to use it you have to disable System Integrity Protection to use this tool. You'll need to download MacForge to use it. All of the installation instructions are on the GitHub page.\nIt does not work for the time being on macOS macOS Big Sur due to increased system protections there. Only time will tell if it will be supported there. However, it works perfectly fine on macOS Catalina.\nA different way to \"name\" or \"identify\" different desktops is by changing their wallpapers, as desktops can have individual wallpapers. However, this unfortunately will not be helpful if you have applications and windows that are covering the whole screen area.\n\nA: No, there is no way to do that in the current build. Well, sort of. An example is if you have iTunes open in fullscreen in a separate desktop, and go to mission control, the desktop will be called iTunes.\n", "Q: Why won't closing the lid sleep my MacBook Pro with external monitor attached after upgrading to Lion? Up until yesterday (with Snow Leopard), closing the lid would cause my MacBook to sleep whether or not the external monitor was connected.\nSince upgrading to Lion last night, closing the lid when the external monitor is attached just tosses all windows to that screen and keeps going.\nI realize I can sleep via the Apple menu or keyboard before closing the lid. I'd rather not have to, and I'm wondering if there's a setting to restore the sleep-on-close behavior.\n\nA: One alternative is use the \"hot corners\" feature instead of closing the lid to put the display to sleep.\nFor example, you can set it up so that moving the mouse to the bottom right corner of the screen initiates \"Sleep.\"\nThe setting is in System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver > Screen Saver and click the Hot Corners... button.\n\nA: I too have been puzzled by this since installing Lion, especially as I've been observing both behaviors (my MBP sometimes went to sleep when closing the lid while external monitor attached, sometimes it didn't).\nI think I have found what is different in both scenarios: the power (magsafe) cable.\nI believe that if you unplug the power cord before closing the lid, the mac will go to sleep when you close the lid. If the power cord is still plugged in, it won't sleep.\nThis might not answer the question \"how can I make it always sleep\", but it does answer the original question, which is \"why\"...\n\nA: edit: See this as the behaviour has changed: Why won't closing the lid sleep my MacBook Pro with external monitor attached after upgrading to Lion?\nThere are two groups of people. Those who wish to have dual displays and have closing the lid go into sleep and people who wish to disable the monitor display, close the lid and use the external monitor as if you had 'docked' with it.\nPreviously, if you wished to switch from the macbook to an external monitor entirely then you had to perform the following to put the laptop into clamshell mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the computer is plugged in to an outlet using the AC power\nadapter.\n\n*Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to your computer.\n\n*With the computer turned on connect the Apple portable (using the appropriate\nApple adapter if necessary) to the appropriate port on the external\ndisplay or projector and turn the display or projector on.\n\n*Once your computer's Desktop appears on the external display, close the\ncomputer's lid.\n\n*Once the lid is closed, wake the computer up by\neither clicking your mouse button or by pressing a key on your\nexternal keyboard.\nsource: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3131\nSo to put the machine in clamshell mode required you to put it to sleep and wake it back up again. As far as user experience goes, that is somewhat jarring.\nAs you have the other options to put the machine to sleep, it seems very likely that this change will remain.\nRight now, there is no way to alter this behaviour.\n\nA: Though not answering your question, why not use a keyboard shortcut or the menu to sleep the machine?  \nI see this option as preferable as you'd use the hinge less, and probably stop it from wearing out quicker too.  \n\nA: \nif there's a setting to restore the sleep-on-close behavior\n\nYes, there is. To restore Snow Leopard behavior just run the following command in the Terminal while the external monitor is disconnected and reboot:\nsudo nvram boot-args=iog=0x0\n\nI've just used it on my Lion – works like a charm.\n \nIf you ever want to reset it back, either run the following (and reboot of course):\nsudo nvram -d boot-args\n\nor just reset your PRAM with ⌘+⌥+P+R if for some reason you can't boot.\n\nA: Found the solution which suits me, as I'm already using ControlPlane, one of the best CPU/Power-efficient schedulers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Context\n\n*Add Laptop Lid Open/Closed State evidence source\n\n*Add a rule triggering that Context on laptop lid close\n\n*Add an action with pmset sleepnow script attached\n\n\nVoila\n\nA: This question is years old, but still relevant. I had this issue too and came up with a script that monitors the lid state and puts the machine to sleep when the lid is closed: https://github.com/pirj/noclamshell\n\nA: Well… I have \"a solution\" as long as you are willing to accept a few less-than-ideal aspects.\nHere's how it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the 'brightness' tool (included in the zip below), check the active display IDs\n\n*Add your laptop display ID number to a shell script (see zip)\n\n*Run the shell script via launchd to monitor /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/ for changes\n\n*If the script sees that your laptop display is not active, it tells the computer to sleep\n\n\nCaveat\nIdeally we would monitor the system for resolution changes, except that I can't find any way to do that automatically.\n(It seems like there would have to be a way to do that, but my GoogleFu has not turned up any.)\n\"Bug\"\nIt can take a minute or two for the script to notice that something has happened. (It seems much longer when you're waiting, but it will happen.)\nHOWTO\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need to download this http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18414/scripts/ase-18037.zip\n\n*unzip it and read the README.txt file\n\n*copy the 3 included files to their proper locations (as explained in the README)\n\n*edit one of the files to include your monitor's ID number (ditto)\n\n\nA: This similar to what I am experiencing:\nI just upgraded to Lion on my Macbook (White 1.83 2007), I have an external Samsung XL2370HD monitor. The Macbook was sometimes running hot with the lid down with Snow Leopard. \nThe solution was to lift the lid half way to let it cool, and also to gain access to the built-in keyboard when the external keyboard was not hooked back up. Now with Lion, it switches back to the Macbook LCD display automatically when the lid is opened, and sometimes the colorsync settings get mixed up in the process, causing the second display to be off color until I manually reset the screen resolution to 1920 x 1080. \nAlso noticed that the ctrl+zoom wheel only zoomed in an area of 1280 x 800 on the samsung set to 1920 x 1080. This seems to be a bug, because restarting with the lid down into 1920 mode, all is well. \nI can't find anyway to have the lid open except in mirror mode. Win 7 on Bootcamp works fine and I can lift the lid without it switching. It was very convenient to be able to close the Macbook to sleep it and then click the mouse to wake it on the ext monitor, then sleep and open the lid to wake the built-in display. That is the optimal way it should work, and has worked previously with dual displays.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try restarting the Mac in just the external mode (lid closed with pull down menu restart). the lid switch now seems to toggle when you lift and close the lid. So opening it once does nothing, but opening it a second time switches it to the built-in screen, and then a third lift and close puts it to sleep again. \n\n*Click on the mouse in the third sleep mode and it returns to the external display (albeit with resized windows). I believe that Lion may adapt itself (learn?) automatically, which would be very cool, but I suspect that restarting in the different screen modes eventually may help reset the PRAM settings back to normal. \n\n*Also try changing resolutions on both sides. It seems to cache whatever you are doing, and may just be hiccuping on earlier saved PRAM data. \n\n*A last resort is a PRAM reset: Hold alt(option) + apple + p + r on reboot, after the chime. Hold the keys down and let it chime three times before releasing and booting up. BTW, Do this on an externally attached keyboard, lid closed if possible. This will give priority to the external monitor booted, hopefully.\n\n", "Q: How can I reactivate the fn + arrow buttons that changed in Safari 5.1? Safari 5.1 (Snow Leopard) seems to have disabled the combination of fn + arrow buttons for navigation (page up, page down, top, bottom). I know the same can be achieved with option + top, down and command + top, down, respectively but I find it rather impractical to use.\nAre there any tips already how to reactivate this or do I even have to fear that fn + arrow behaviour has been completely dropped in Lion?\nEdit: Added Lion explicitly to the tags since they seemed to have dropped the Home and End behaviour of fn + arrow there as well in many applications.\n\nA: I've noticed that home/end/pgup/pgdown aren't working on my main user account but if I create a new user and log in as them, they all work as expected.  So I figure it's a snipe hunt for some preference/library/plugin manager that is doing horrible things to Safari.  I already purged SIMBL but it doesn't look like it helped.\n(edited to add) I poked around some more and I guess I made some changes to my default key bindings at some point - I removed ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict and now PgUp/PgDown/Home/End all work as I expect in a browser, although now I'm stuck with emacs navigation inside of editboxes.

How do I turn this off?\n\nA: I updated an app called Karabiner and it turned some Mission Control shortcuts off. I like moving desktops. Here's how you turn them back on:\n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control and change the settings for \"Move left a space\" and \"Move right a space\" or disable them completely.\n", "Q: Can I show the Mission Control desktop number in the menu bar? Spaces used to show the space number in the menu bar; I would glance at it regularly to see which space I was in (1, 2, 3, etc).\nHow do I get Mission Control to display the current desktop in the menu bar like that?\n\nA: Found SpaceId, a solution which I prefer over WhichSpace. It has options for viewing all created spaces (not just the current one) as well as multi-monitor and full-screen support. It also fixes some visual bugs WhichSpace suffers from. Works well on MacOS 12.0.1.\n\n\nA: Maybe the open source WhichSpace project can do this:\n\nWhichSpace\nHave you ever forgotten which space is currently active on OS X (10.11+) and wanted a quick way to tell? Didn't think so... but I did!\nScreenshot\n\n\n\nA: I found this question because I had the same issue. Turns out, all I really wanted was to instantly know what screen I am on.\nI just accidentally \"discovered\" the obvious: if you 4-finger swipe up, everything zooms out. Across the top, all your desktops are shown and your current desktop is highlighted! (4-finger swipe down to go back to normal).\nSo this quick & easy approach solves things for me! Besides requiring much less work, it's also better than making custom numbered background images because I often have windows that entirely block my background. Now, I just swipe up, then back down and, in a split second, I know exactly where I am.\nPosting here just in case it helps someone else...\n\nA: This problem now has a much more robust solution, thanks to Total Spaces.  This app brings back the old 2D grid of spaces and shows the space number in the menu bar.\n\nA: I could not find any built-in feature for this, so I decided to use the backgrounds.\n\n\n*\n\n*I found a background image that I wanted, and made 8 copies of it.\n\n*Then I wrote the numbers 1-8 on each of them, next to where the dock usually is.\n\n*Then you press ctrl+1 to make sure you're in desktop 1, right click the background, and choose the image with 1 written on it.\n\n*Then close down the system preference box (otherwise you end up changing only desktop one).\n\n*Then press ctrl+2 and do right click again.\nNot allowed to post screenshot :( to show how it looks.\n", "Q: Is there a shortcut to expand all folders in Finder's list view?

I often move windows around on the desktop by clicking and dragging them by the title bar.  As of Lion, you can resize the window from the top, so if you put the cursor in the top portion of the title bar, the icon turns into resize arrows, when I actually want to move the window, not resize it.\nIs there a way to turn this new feature off or customize it so resizing from the top is disabled?\n\nA: Lion has (at least for now) the following preference keys:\nAppleEdgeResizing (boolean)\nAppleEdgeResizeBorderSize\nAppleEdgeResizeCornerSize\nAppleEdgeResizeCornerSizeNW\nAppleEdgeResizeCornerSizeNE\nAppleEdgeResizeCornerSizeSW\nAppleEdgeResizeCornerSizeSE\nAppleEdgeResizeExteriorSize\n\n\nThese can be accessed either with either the following commands:\ndefaults read DOMAIN KEY\ndefaults write DOMAIN KEY VALUE\ndefaults delete DOMAIN KEY\n\nWhere DOMAIN can be either -globalDomain to affect all apps, or a specific app's identifier e.g.: com.apple.TextEdit\nOr edit ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist or other .plist file thereabouts, in Xcode or some other Property List editor.\nApps need to be restarted before they'll recognize any changes.\n\nA: Based on mjmt's excellent info, here's how to globally disable resizing (tested in 10.7.4):\ndefaults write -globalDomain AppleEdgeResizing NO\n\nLog out and log back into your account (or quit every single app) to see changes take effect.\n\nA: Not currently configurable or able to be turned off by any out of the box control or setting.\nIt's meant to be always on and you'll likely need a third party solution (or a hidden default setting like the other answers have provided) to change the logic behind the resizing.\n", "Q: How do you disable the zoom effect / window animations in the new OS X Lion?

And how do I put it back in the right place?\n\nA: Starting with Mac OS Lion 10.7.2, you can drag to re-order your desktops, even the ones that are in full-screen mode.\n\nA: You can't drag or relocate them even after you disable automatic ortanization in System Preferences -> Mission Control.\nThey seem to be fixed, which is weird. Let's hope that in a future update, Apple fixes this issue. \n\nA: What you can do is this: \nDelete the desktops and then recreate the by hovering over them and pressing the red thing in the corner, then looking at the right to make a new desktop.\n\nThis is no longer necessary as of Mac OS Lion 10.7.2, see this answer for an easier solution.\n\nA: By default, Spaces are reorganized by last used. You can change this in System Preferences -> Mission Control.\n\nA: You can change the windows displayed on the single desktops by pressing the alt key and then clicking on a desktop.

I logged in as an administrative user and deleted the original .db file then copied over my new one and gave it the ABC123 name I'd copied from the user's original. Convoluted, and maybe someone has a better way, but that's what worked for me. There was on icon out of place when I opened LaunchPad but it was easy enough to fix and all my folders were as I'd set them.\n\nA: I haven't tried it, but there's lporg, a command-line utility that purports to do just this.\n", "Q: How to buy multiple Lion licenses from the Mac App Store?

I assume its from the TM drive as the machine is nominally idle (as idle as these machines get, anyway).\nWhat prompted me was that I kept glancing up and see it backing up. It was stuck doing a backup for a long time, so I simply stopped the backup, and tried again. Later, it was still taking forever and nothing happening. So I shut down TM, unmounted the drive, unplugged it, replugged it in. Then I decide to run Repair.\nThe basic question is if this repair time is \"normal\", or is the drive bad.

Just the same way you can open the web inspector or activity window in Safari on your laptop and see all the HTTP requests any website has made, how do you do that on the iphone for an iPhone app, if the iPhone app is using HTML5 (or even if it's a native app)?\n\nA: To watch the http(s) traffic, you will need to intercept the network traffic travelling between your iPhone and your Internet Service Provider (ISP).\nTo do this you need to set your phone to use WiFi and to pass network traffic through a proxy. Proxies include squid and Charles.\nA good proxy will offer log files and allow you to see server addresses and, if not encrypted, requested URLs.\n\nA: Mitmproxy will also work for SSL connections, and even has a tutorial specific to iOS.\n\nA: indeed if you download charles and follow the instruction on this page (under iphone). You can monitor the http requests that your iPhone \nhttp://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/faqs/\n\nA: The easiest method is to install a debugging proxy and point your iPhone to it (specify the proxy address in the settings for the wifi network). Obviously, this'll only work over wifi and not via a cellular data connection. You'll then have access to all of the http(s) requests and responses sent and received by your iPhone.\nAs several commenters have mentioned (thanks!), a popular option is Charles, which supports Windows, macOS and Linux.

I found this script online somewhere and I'm trying to make it so that it constantly checks to see if Final Cut Express is rendering and when it finishes rendering, it displays a Growl notification.\nEDIT: My question is: How do I get the script to constantly check to see if FCE is rendering and once it's done rendering, display a notification? The script works to display the notification, now how do I get it to work right?\nEDIT: I tried using an idle handler. It didn't work, but maybe I'm not using the idle handler right.\nHere's the code for the script:  \ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Final Cut Express HD\"\n        set windowList to get name of every window\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nif windowList contains missing value then\nend if\n\ntell application \"GrowlHelperApp\" -- ** the daemon that is behind the scenes\n    -- Make a list of all the notification types that this script will ever send: \n    -- ** They really mean \"ever\" or you'll have to reregister.\n    set the allNotificationsList to {\"Render Complete\"}\n    -- , \"Another Test Notification\"} \n    --** Enable another notification\n\n    -- Make a list of the notifications that will be enabled by default. \n    -- ** We'll see shortly that a note must be enabled and the user can disable it.\n    -- Notifications not enabled by default can be enabled later in the 'Applications' tab of the growl prefpane.\n    set the enabledNotificationsList to {\"Render Complete\"} -- ** just one turned on, the other not.\n\n    -- Register our script with growl.\n    -- You can optionally (as here) set a default icon for this script's notifications.\n    -- ** Theoretically, you only have to register once, but there is absolutely no harm in doing\n    -- it every time the script runs, i.e., leaving this line in your script.\n    register as application \"Final Cut Render Complete Script\" all notifications allNotificationsList default notifications enabledNotificationsList icon of application \"Final Cut Express HD\"\n\n    --  Send a Notification...\n    -- This one will appear because it was enabled by default.\n    notify with name \"Render Complete\" title \"Render Complete\" description \"Your Render has Finished.\" application name \"Final Cut Render Complete Script\"\n\n    -- This one will not appear -- it wasn't enabled by default so the user has to turn it on in the 'Applications' tab of the Growl prefpane to see it.\n    -- Take out the comments to enable it.\n    --notify with name \"Another Test Notification\" title \"Another Test Notification  \" description \"Alas  you won't see me until you enable me yourself...\" application name \"Final Cut Render Complete Script\"\nend tell\n\n\nA: Did you save the script with the idle handler as a .app file with the \"Stay Open\" checkbox selected in the Save dialog?\nThis is required for the code within the idle handler to be run \"on idle\", else it won't run at all. Save it that way and try again.\nYou're checking windowList for missing value. This sounds like a condition where no FCE windows are open. If you want the block where you're scripting Growl to execute, it should be within the if statement, not after.\nAlso, depending on what version of Growl you're using, it might respond to one of \"Growl\" (v1.3+) or \"GrowlHelperApp\" (v<1.3), but not the other. To future-proof your script, replace\ntell application \"GrowlHelperApp\n\nwith the following:\ntell application id \"com.Growl.GrowlHelperApp\"\n\nAll versions of Growl respond to that.\nThe block of code you have that triggers Growl looks like you modified their example, and from your comments it sounds like that's working fine.\n", "Q: What does \"Remove Alerts / Attachments / Reminders\" mean in iCal? I'm subscribing to a Google calendar using the new, lovely, Corinthian leather iCal on Lion, and it's asking me if I want to remove alerts, attachments, and reminders:\nWhat do these options mean?\n\n\nA: Attachment removal should be obvious to most - but I have no good explanation for why Alerts and Reminders are called out distinctly when to iCal they are one and the same concept.\nRemoving attachments means you won't download any files attached to the event and have them stored locally within iCal (and on the file system). I suppose you could be safer, too if a calendar contained a malicious or malformed attachment.\nRemoving alerts / reminders means your mac won't interrupt you if warnings are set for a specific event (in relation to the start time). Leaving these enabled gives me great unease since reminders are very powerful on Mac OS X.\n\nYou can open arbitrary files (including presumably an attachment assuming you can guess my short name or if wildcards are not sanitized in the process of accepting an event), applications, schedule an email to be sent by your mac without user intervention. If the person who makes an event added an email reminder to a specific event, imagine a case where 30 people accept that meeting to their personal calendar. At the designated time, the email address that was supposed to get a mail from the initial event would instead get one email each from every machine that was running as the alarm moment passes.\nI imagine several Apple engineers have thought this through to ensure that I can't start a file sharing service on someone else's machine though a calendar reminder. On the surface, you are allowing someone else to operate any file, script that is already on your mac as well as let them send their canned email on your behalf should you leave your mac running.\n\nA: I believe these options are generally more relevant when you are subscribing to someone else's calendar. \n(Or one that you use more actively on another machine.)\nFor example, you might subscribe to your spouse or partner's calendar to know their schedule, but not necessarily want to auto-download the TPS reports they attach to them, or hear a duck quack 15 minutes before each of their meetings.\n", "Q: Getting to the Dashboard in Lion I'm trying to decide whether or not to upgrade to Lion.  I use the Dashboard a lot, and I value the ability to get to it quickly by hitting the button on my keyboard.  In Lion, it sounds like I would have to open Mission Control, then use my mouse to open the Dashboard.\nIs this the only way to get to the Dashboard in Lion?  Does the old keyboard button still work?  If not, can I set a keyboard shortcut to open it without going through Mission Control first?\n\nA: By default the Dashboard is on its own space, always the leftmost one. The Dashboard button still works and makes you jump right there.\nAlternatively, you can disable this behavior in the General preference pane and revert to the Dashboard as an overlay, just as it was before Lion.\n\nA: check this:\n\nso, hotkey for dashboard is working.\n\nA: My new MacBook Air's keyboard doesn't HAVE a Dashboard button, it was replaced by a Launchpad button, and I hate Launchpad.\nSo I installed KeyRemap4MacBook: http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/\nAnd that allowed me to swap the Launchpad key's functionality.  Now it launches Dashboard instead.  Happy!\n", "Q: How to disable the most recently used items in App Exposé on Lion? When using App Exposé on Lion ( Control-↓ by default), the lower part of the screen above the dock is reserved for minimized windows. A new feature of at least TextEdit in Lion is that it also shows the most recent documents as icons, which makes for an absolutely crowded area. I never use MRUs in my workflow so that's an absolute waste of space and of time.\nIs it possible to disable this behavior and only show minimized windows?\n\nA: OK, after twiddling different combinations, I found a solution that works (at least on Mac OS X 9.5 Mavericks). \n1) Open the app in question (e.g. TextEdit). \n2) Click Menubar / File / Open Recent / Clear Menu. Note that there is also a Menubar / Apple / Recent Items / Clear Menu. Clicking this general one doesn't help; click the app-specific one. \n3) Open System Preferences / General and set Recent Items to None. \nNote: While this keeps the minimized-items section of exposé clear of recent items, it also unfortunately disables access to recent items in most other places (e.g. the menubar or dock). \nBoo Apple: http://www.apple.com/feedback/\n\n\nA: Apparently setting the Number of recent items to None in general preferences does the trick.\n\nUnfortunately it also disables the Open Recent submenu, but I honestly care less: having an uncluttered minimized windows list in Exposé is much more important.\n\nA: I managed to figure out how to clear and permanently disable this in Expose so figured I'd post here.\nI'm using BBEdit but imagine the steps are the same for TextEdit(?)\nYou have to set the Recent Items to 0 (as above) AND delete the contents of:\n/Users/[your username here]/Library/Preferences/com.barebones.bbedit.PreferenceData/\n(As I say I imagine there's something similar for TextEdit)\nThis folder rather astonishingly contained the history of every file I have EVER edited in BBEdit(!!) some 4000 odd files - also a security risk in my book.\nIf you were very paranoid (as am I) you could also chmod this folder to be readable only so it is never written to:\nsudo chmod -R 444 /Users/[your username here]/Library/Preferences/com.barebones.bbedit.PreferenceData/\nHope that helps...  Apple/BBEdit should really include this functionality within Expose as an option so we can turn it off in my humble opinion.\n\nA: I have just cleared recent items by going to apple menu, selecting \"Recent Items\" then \"Clear Menu\".\n", "Q: Can I get Mission Control to show minimized windows? Exposé in Snow Leopard showed minimized windows — if any — in a dedicated area at the bottom. This was extremely helpful and efficient, especially combined with the \"Minimize windows in application icon\" setting of the Dock.\nMission Control is apparently done with this behavior, so monitoring and fetching minimized windows is now a pain.\nIs there a way to show minimized windows anywhere in Mission Control?\n\nA: If you exposé (three finger swipe down or whatever shortcut you've set up) you can then switch through all of the applications by pressing tab.  \nPressing tab on its own will go through each application showing all windows (minimised or not), pressing cmd and tab will show you the swap icon bar (in middle of screen) at the same time as going through the applications.  The arrow keys followed by enter will help you select what window you want.\nIt's certainly not as elegant as SL used to be, but it's the only thing I've found that kinda/sorta/maybe comes close.\n\nA: The most straightforward way is to use Exposé on the application with minimized windows to show them.\n\nA: I don't think it's turned on by default, but you can turn on App Exposé (which shows minimized windows) as a trackpad gesture using three or four finger swipes downward. It's in Trackpad>More Gestures. If that's not quite what you're looking for, you might also try Hyperdock, which replicates Windows 7's aero peek functionality on OS X; it includes minimized windows.\n\nA: Press Command-Tab which will show applications including minimized ones. Highlight the one you are looking for, release Tab and while still holding Command press on Opt/Alt before letting all keys go. This will bring up the minimized application.\n", "Q: Is it possible for an iPad - or any iOS product - to get a virus? And if so, have there been any recorded instances of this?\n(I'm excluding the so-called \"jail broken\" devices.)\n\nA: The fact that the devices can be jail broken at all means that there are exploitable weaknesses in the security of iOS, because jail breaks involve bypassing the usual security to be able to run software that you couldn't otherwise run.\nBut -- being jail broken doesn't necessarily mean you are more vulnerable.\nThat said, unless the jail breaker's are lucky and can find a serious flaw like the recent PDF exploit, jail breaking an iOS system can be a little involved. Someone might be able to get you to click on a link on a website, but not go through a multi-step procedure where you are rebooting the devices with buttons held down, etc.\nI've not heard of an in-the-wild trojan/virus for iOS.\n\nA: I think the answers here are a bit misleading.  iOS is widely held to be the most secure software platform, mobile or otherwise.  Any human made software system is vulnerable, but so far there has been no malware of any sort reported for iOS.  It's an attractive target, though, and the existence of jailbreak exploits means that it's not impossible.\n\nA: Yes, security vulnerabilities that would allow people to hack or infect Macs and iOS products do exist, though they're not exploited very often.\nPwn2Own is an annual contest where competitors try to hack into machines to win them as prizes. Both Macs and iOS products are hacked most years.\nHere is one more story about an exploit that was patched:\n\nFriday, Apple released an update to its mobile operating system (iOS 4.3.4) which patches a couple of vulnerabilities that left a door open for malware infections on the iPad, 3rd and 4th generation iPod touch, iPhone 4, and iPhone 3GS.\nApple's update describes the CoreGraphics vulnerability as \"A buffer overflow…in FreeType's handling of TrueType fonts. Viewing a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.\"\n[...]\nThis update comes on the heels of an alert from German IT group BSI, which warned of an unpatched vulnerability that would \"allow attackers to gain access to the entire system with administrative privileges.\"\n\nApple does \"verify\" any software for their App Stores, but developers have been known to sneak in features without Apple's testers seeing them, so don't expect this to entirely protect you.\n\nA: It is possible, but not likely to get a virus from an app. All iOS apps are vetted by Apple. A virus is generally malicious code installed and run unintentionally. Because all apps are checked, unless you jailbreak jailbreak device, you should be safe. \nOn the other hand, as has been pointed out in the comments, it is quite possible that an iOS device can get infected via vulnerability in Safari or, as was specifically mentioned, the PDF reader. This is possible largely because the content that comes in from the web is not checked by anyone. The situation is worse on iOS because you cannot install antivirus. (Apple wouldn't allow an app that integrates that deeply with the OS into the store.) Contrast that with \"traditional\" computing environments where such protections are available. \n", "Q: Mission Control to App Exposé In Snow Leopard you could switch to App Exposé from global Exposé by clicking an icon in the Dock. Doing the same in Lion merely exits you from Mission Control and focuses on that app.\nIs there a way to go to a given App Exposé from Mission Control?\n\nA: If you activate Mission Control whilst hovering the mouse over an app in the dock, it will do an Exposé for that app.\nActivating Mission Control any other time will do a global Exposé as you say.\nWhile in mission control, if you slide one finger up on the magic mouse (imagine it's a 2 two finger swipe with a trackpad) whilst hovering over the app windows, it'll Exposé the selected app's windows\nIn one of the earlier developer previews you could slide one finger up (on the magic mouse) over a dock icon while in Mission Control and it would trigger a per-app Exposé. Alas, it seems this feature has been removed.\nThere could be a hidden switch to turn it back on, but I've not had a play around with those 'secrets' apps to have a look yet.\n\nA: *\n\n*Swipe up with 3 fingers = show mission control.\n\n*When mission control is shown, move your mouse to the app window, and\n\n*Swipe up with 2 fingers\n\n\nThis will show the app's windows.\n", "Q: Keywurl for Safari 5.1 / Lion Has anyone made Keywurl work with Safari 5.1 after their Lion upgrade?\nI tried updating the MaxBundleVersion without luck:\nhttp://hacketal.com/making-keywurl-work-with-safari-5\n\nI'm not interested in using Glims, SafariStand, etc, I just want Keywurl to work.\n\nA: There is now a Safari extension for Safari 5.1 called Safari Keyword Search by Arne Martin Auerlie. It uses new API calls in 5.1 to reproduce all the functionality of Keywurl without the need for a SIMBL hack!\nIt is still an early version, so the interface is still a little rough, but it works wonderfully.\nGet it here:\nhttps://github.com/arnemart/SafariKeywordSearch\nRead Arne's blog here:\nhttp://am.aurlien.net/\nAlso if you don't mind hacks, Safari Omnibar does something similar, attempting to replicate the behaviour of Chrome's Omnibar.\nhttps://github.com/rs/SafariOmnibar\nIt is a bit hacky, so I would recommend Arne's extension in preference to it, but it is worth watching how both projects develop.\n", "Q: make, gcc and other developer tools unavailable after installing XCode on Lion I installed XCode after I upgraded to OS X Lion, I downloaded XCode from the App Store. gcc, make and such are still not found and I cannot compile anything from source because of this.

Is this normal?\n\nA: Is /Developer/usr/bin in your PATH variable?\nYou could try ln -s /Developer/usr/bin/make /usr/bin/make\n\nA: Make sure that your system's $PATH has been updated. If you had a terminal window open before you installed, and are using the same one now that you have Xcode installed, open a new one and let it run through .bashrc/.bash_profile/etc again to update the path. If you know the specific file that the $PATH variable lives in on your system, you can also just run source on that file.\nIf that doesn't work, you can manually add the path that the find command finds these tools at (should be /Developer/usr/bin) to your $PATH inside ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile (depending on how your bash files are configured — mine has everything in ~/.bashrc but I've customized them heavily).\n\nA: Yeah, looks like Apple has moved all the Developer Tools under /Developer. Why, beats me. Fixing the $PATH is easy, but the annoying part is that the includes have also moved under /Developer/usr/include etc.\nI spent a good half a day trying to compile some PHP extensions, to no avail, running into all sorts of \"blah.h not found\" errors.\n\nA: Finally figured this out. They're under /Developer because installing Xcode from App Store does not install Xcode, but an app named \"Install Xcode\". After running it, everything went back to normal. :)\n", "Q: How to rename a bluetooth device in OSX Lion? Before I upgraded to OSX Lion, I could open up the Bluetooth Preferences, select a device, click on the settings icon, choose 'Rename Device' and rename the Bluetooth device.\nNow that I've upgraded to OSX Lion, the option is there on the same location, but it is called 'Update Name', however, it doesn't do anything for me.

I thought it was a bit strange, since it never told me the password was wrong(keep in mind, the laptop still remembers the old wifi network password), it just grabbed a self assigned IP and complained that it couldn't connect to the internet.\nThis is what I did in effort to establish a connection, with no success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed the network in question from my saved wifi networks.  Upon attempting to reconnect nothing changed, still gets a self assigned IP, never asks for a new password, no internet connection.\n\n*Removed all entries for the network in question from the Keychain.  After removing the keychain entry, any time I reconnect to the network, the keychain entry is re-added with the old, incorrect, password.\n\n*Edited the password in the keychain entry to the new, correct, password.  This resulted in the same behavior as my first attempt, nothing new.\n\n*Removed entry from saved networks, deleted keychain entry, restarted mac.  Exactly the same as before.\n\n\nSo after a good 20 minutes of attempting to connect to the network, I could never even get it to prompt me for a new password(the password it has stored is definitely different than the current, correct, password for the network).  So I gave up and came home to attempt to figure it all out.\nAny suggestions on how to get connected to this network with a new password?  Have I done all the right things, and should now just go file a radar on this behavior?\n\nA: If you have checked both the user keychain and the system keychain for old passwords, we're left with obscure guesses.\nTwo things come immediately to mind (from the obscure side).\n\n*\n\n*Your mac will join any base station with that SSID. I have seen people literally setting up a second router in busy coffee shops - you have to hold the option key and make note of the mac address you have connected to and see it change to catch this.\n\n*If your wifi connects to the router wifi, it doesn't mean the DHCP server has any more addresses to lease. You will need the owner to reset or power cycle the router to see if the leases are all out and unexpired. You basically have a great pipe connecting you to the main, but no water is flowing to you until you get a lease.\n\n\nA: What a puzzle.  You have tried all of the likely issues regarding wifi so perhaps you might rule in or out a couple of other pieces.\nI have a few ideas for you to consider.  \nFirst find and delete all session cookies, cache and browsing history related to this coffee shop.  If it fails in the same way, try to get online with another browser from the same user account. If this approach does not work, here's plan B. \nCreate a second user account on your mac and try to login. This is a popular approach often recommended by Apple when I have had problems.  If that works, we can assume something in your primary user account is getting in the way.\nOne of the things that could be in play here is the \"man in the middle\" scheme or something akin to firesheep. I'm not the right person to help with issues like this but you are experiencing an unusual situation.  Googling these terms might help. \n\nA: I had the same problem.  The answer above did not resolve it, but choosing \"Join other Network\" and then entering the same network name did work.\nA little more detail:  I had this problem when Verizon Fios Premium tech support turned off my WEP security on their router in order to diagnose a wireless connection problem with a Win XP laptop.  When they turned the security back on with the same password the Air book no longer connected, but if WEP was left turned off it worked ok.\nSo when I chose \"Join Other Network\" the setting came up as no security.  Not sure if that was because I was last connected to the current network with no security.\nIn any case when I entered the same name of the current network and selected WEP Security it asked for the PW and I'm off and running.\nYour mileage may vary.\nHTH.\ned\n\nA: Situation: well-meaning staff will tell their customers to remove and re-join the wireless network in question after a password change, only to have their efforts thwarted by the OSX Network Settings that never bothers deleting the Keychain item associated with a formerly trusted network.\nI for one would love it if we could .. Opt-click-join to force the password dialogue, or something, anything would be easier than having to explain the following procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keychain\n\n*Make sure you have Login keychain and the All category selected in the left pane\n\n*Enter partial network name into the keychain Search field\n\n*Select the corresponding found item, delete it, confirm admin password\n\n*Disable+Enable wireless network interface\n\n*Re-select the network, enter the updated password\n\n", "Q: Can i change the default Mac App Store install folder? I prefer to have all applications installed per-user, to ~/Applications/ rather than globally. The default location for apps installed from the Mac App Store is the global applications folder located at /Applications/.\nIs there a defaults write com.apple.AppStore command I can run in the terminal, or perhaps a .plist file I can edit manually, to change this default preference?\n\nA: Regarding Mac OS X File System Overview, it seems Apple enforcing the standard compliance for developer to follow their rules on application folder which are within /Applications or ~/Applications. The concern is to comply the way Mac App Store deliver the updates.\nif you not comfort enough to use default folder, yes you are still able to move the application which you had download from Mac App Store to another folder with two caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will be required to enter an administrative password to move the\napp from the /Applications folder.\n\n*If an update appears in the MAS for an installed app that has been moved you will get an error message about having apps installed\n    from another account. To update the app you will have to Delete\nthe\n    app entirely and then install the updated app or Move the app back to the /Applications folder\n\n\nA: At this point there is no details on this (But I am sure there is a property or .plist) but in the meantime you can create a simple Automator \"Folder Actions\" workflow, that moves the apps to the folder of your choice. This is simple and mostly happens in the background.\nOne problem I see with this is how Updates work. \n\nA: Here is an option, while it is not exactly what you asked for, it will accomplish most of your goals:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new folder at the root of your boot drive and name it\nPubApplications, duplicate the permissions of the Applications\nFolder.\n\n*Copy (Option Drag) Don't Move all applications that you\nwant publicly accessible to that folder. \n\n*Copy Don't Move the apps you want in your ~/Applications folder to that folder. \n\n*Rename /Applications to /Applications.bak or /.Applications.bak if you want\nit hidden. \n\n*Create a symlink in your root folder named Applications, pointing to the Applications folder in your home directory.\nln -s /Users/your_name/Applications /Applications\nI am not sure who uses the computer besides you, and I am also not sure exactly what you are trying to accomplish, whether it is to streamline backups, or keep your apps private from others, or if this is simply where you like to install apps.\nNote - the above above method will break things for other users if they exist. You could use:\nln -s ~/Applications /Applications\n\ninstead of the previous symlink command, although I have had issues with that and you would need to ensure each user had a ~/Applications folder.\n\nA: I usually move all my applications acquired from the MAS in a subfolder, e.g. Applications/Games or Applications/Utilities or whatever suits better.\nAs wongacid said, you will be required an administrative password to perform the move.\nI have already had several updates to my apps, so it seems updating moved applications works flawlessly, at least for programs kept within the Applications folder. I can not be sure about other locations, though.\n", "Q: Changing the system language globally I just installed Mac OS X Lion on an iMac.\nI noticed that the system language during installation and log in screen is Spanish (my primary language). But, once inside (desktop, etc) is English.\nI want everything to be in English. Including the log in screen etc. How do I change that?\n\nA: You can use this link How to change the language of the login window, I hope it will help you.\n", "Q: How do I take a steathy picture with my iSight camera from the command line? Is there a command line utility that allows me to take a picture from the built in camera?  Something like screencapture allows for, well, screen captures.\nThe reasoning for a command line tool is I would like for it to be stealthy, without a countdown or flash or other indication to the user that a picture is being taken.\n\nA: OS X does not come with any utilities for this purpose.\nA third-party solution is imagesnap. It lets you capture an image from any connected video device, defaulting to the built-in iSight camera. It's available as a single binary file you could bundle with your software, and is released into the public domain.\nThere are many references around the internet to the iSightCapture utility, which used to be a popular choice for this, but it is no longer maintained.\n\nA: Unfortunately imagesnap no longer appears to work on OSX10.11/El Capitan so another alternative is to install ffmpeg (MacPorts: port install ffmpeg or brew install ffmpeg) and run:\nffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 1280x720 -framerate 30 -i \"0\" -vframes 1 out.jpg\n\n\nA: Natively, there is a way but it is extremely basic. You can use Automator to make an application that takes a picture. The action is called \"Take Video Snapshot\" and requires a \"built-in camera, iSight or other webcam, or digital camera connected to your computer.\" Just check the box to take picture automatically and you now have an app you can call from the command line. Save it as an app and then you can call it from the command line like open TakePicture.app.\n\n\nA: As another poster mentioned there is a utility called iSightCapture which can do this.\nI once wrote a script to periodically grab an iSight image and a grab of my two monitors and post it to a private website so I could see what's going on at my computer.  Here's how I scripted iSightCapture to do so.\n#!/bin/bash\n~/scripts/isightcapture -w 320 -h 240 -t jpg ~/capture.jpg \nRESULT=$?\nif [ $RESULT -ne 0 ]; then\n    growlnotify -s -a FaceTime -m \"isightcapture failed ($RESULT)\" $0\n    exit 1\nelse\n    sips -f horizontal ~/capture.jpg\nfi\n\nscreencapture -S -tjpg ~/scr1.jpg ~/scr2.jpg \nRESULT=$?\nif [ $RESULT -ne 0 ]; then\n    growlnotify -s -a FaceTime -m \"screencapture failed ($RESULT)\" $0\n    exit 2\nelse \n    sips -z 240 320 ~/scr1.jpg \n    sips -z 240 320 ~/scr2.jpg\nfi\nexit 0\n\nNote the use of 'sips' to flip the isight capture horizontally.  \nA working download link (2012-10-05): iSightCapture (via), tested on OSX 10.8.2\n\nA: Use imagesnap. It can be installed with brew install imagesnap or by downloading the binary from the website.\nOne use for it is to take series of snapshots:\nwhile :; do\n    imagesnap ~/Desktop/$(date +%y%m%d%H%M%S).png\n    sleep ${1-1}\ndone\n\nIt doesn't crop images horizontally either.

It no longer appears in the favorites section.\nI know I can open it from Terminal, but I want to do it in Finder easily like I could in 10.6.\n\nA: Disks have been removed from the Finder sidebar by default, however you can easily reenable these.  In Finder go to File > Preferences and then to the Sidebar tab.  There you can choose what gets displayed in your sidebar.\n\n\nA: Shift-Cmd-C is how I do it.  You can also use the \"Go\" menu in Finder and choose the \"Computer\" option.\n", "Q: Is there a clipboard manager/app with a searchable history/pasteboard?

Xcode 4.1 Installer downloaded from the App Store, I have no applications running except the installer and the Finder. The dialog that pops up says that iTunes needs to be quit in order for installation of Xcode to continue.\nHow do I make Xcode installer realize that iTunes isn't running?\n\nA: This is a widely-reported bug in some App Store installers. It sees the iTunesHelper process and displays this error, even though that process is not controlled by the user.\nYou can open Activity Monitor (in /Applications/Utilities), find the process and kill it with the Quit Process button in the top-left corner.\n\nYou can also instead open Terminal (also in /Applications/Utilities), enter the following line and press enter to kill it.\nkillall iTunesHelper\n\n", "Q: Unable to resize Lion partition I decided to do a clean install of Lion on a new partition, then after copying my stuff removed the old one. I'm now stuck with 100~ GB of free space and a 20 GB partition that Disk Utility won't let me resize... oops.\n\nI really don't want to have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a partition in the free space\n\n*install Lion onto it then copy my stuff (again)\n\n*delete the old partition and resize the new one\n\n\nIs there anything else I can do?\n\nA: Yes - boot to your Recovery HD and use Disk Utility there to perform the operation. If it's missing, you can download and re-install Lion which will recreate the Recovery HD.\nIt's likely the volume is in use or one file that is open needs to be closed so it can be moved.\n\nA: bmike's suggestion is correct; boot from the Recovery HD itself in order to change anything.\nI would also advise that before making any changes of this sort, you first make a complete bootable disk image backup of your hard disk to an external hard disk using a utility like SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner.\nYou cannot resize with Disk Utility from within Lion because of the existence of the hidden Recovery HD partition. Furthermore, if you try to reformat or re-partition anything on your disk, you risk deleting the hidden Recovery HD partition altogether. This will cause no immediate harm, but it will interfere with many operations should you need to change anything further, or recover from a disaster.\nBy way of providing further insight, there is a procedure for making the hidden Recovery HD partition visible from within Disk Utility while you are booted into the regular Lion or Snow Leopard. You perform a command-line operation to enable Debug Mode in Disk Utility, and this gives you an extra menu in Disk Utility from which you can make the hidden partitions visible.\n\nThe Recovery HD partition is something completely new from Apple. It is my understanding that the makers of utilities like SuperDuper and Carbon Copy Cloner are hoping for further API information from Apple, and have yet to figure out how best to deal with this new situation.\n\nA: I had this issue and was also unable to resize my partition. I called Apple Care and spoke with a senior rep. He said that because I had once installed Boot Camp, but had removed it improperly (with Disk Utility instead of Boot Camp Assistant) that one of those tiny Windows partition was still there, even though it doesn't show up in Disk Utility. He said he'd seen this before and every time it couldn't be fixed, the user had removed Boot Camp via Disk Utility.\nHe said (paraphrasing) to fix the partitions I'd have to back up and re-partition the whole disk. I will update this answer when I've done so.\n", "Q: Use widgets on Desktop Lion How can I use my widgets on the desktop in Lion?

After upgrading he has been met with a login screen showing a single account, \"Guest\". This \"Guest\" account is password-protected and none of the existing passwords he used on the computer seem to work.\nMy friend had previously installed rEFIt on his computer, which apparently hasn't been updated for Lion yet.\nI found this thread on MacRumors where a few other people are reporting the same problem.\nDoes anyone know of a solution?\n\nA: An easier way is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a terminal/console somehow (e.g. start up in recovery mode by holding down option).\n\n*Delete the file /Volumes/<your root volume>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nThat's it.\n\nA: He found a solution on the Apple discussion boards (slightly edited):\n\nI solved this exact problem by doing the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Restart in recovery mode by holding the option key while booting.\n  \n*Open the Terminal, then run resetpassword to set root password.\n  \n*Log out, then log in to the now-available root account.\n  \n*Go to \"Users & Groups\" in System Preferences, and create a new user with the exact same username as your old account.

(that is not difficult but make sure that you unscrew the tiny screws that hold the side metallic pegs too)\n3) buy an external hard disk case SATA to USB, 2 1/2 inches. very cheap, bought mine for 12 euro.\n4) connect your hard disk drive from your macbook or macbook pro to the external hd case you bought. by doing this, you transform the hd drive into a USb stick.\n5) connect the external hd case to another computer. that will be read as a USB drive to the other machine so you can browse through all your files and folders.\n6) go to: library/preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist \n7) delete the file\n8) remove the hd drive from the external hd case\n9) put back the hd drive to your macbook\n10) power it on and now you can see your user account plus another account named \"other\".\nthe trick was to remove the hd drive and use it as a usb drive. \nthis is the only way to remove the loginwindow.plist file from the machine.\nall other ways through the safari only mode will NOT work as the accessibility the terminal gives you is fictitious, is NOT real.\nhope you can all get your mac back.\nps this fix only applies to users who upgraded their lion to 10.7.2 from 10.7.0 and after reboot the only account showing in the login window was the Guest Account with the safari only mode available.\n", "Q: Can you disable rubber-band scrolling in OS X Lion? In OS X Lion, is there a way to disable rubber-band scrolling? This is the bounce that occurs when the window is scrolled beyond the top or bottom edge.\nI'm aware that non-apple input devices don't rubber-band and hope to find a setting or software to eliminate this on the Apple trackpad and mice.\nFollow-up: There's a very good discussion on Apple Support Communities regarding this topic. Apparently defaults write -g NSScrollViewRubberbanding -bool false disables rubber band scrolling for some applications.\n\nA: I found a hidden preference for disabling rubberband scrolling with strings /System/Library/Frameworks/*.framework/Versions/*/* 2> /dev/null | grep -iE '(rubb|elastic)' | grep -v ' ' | sort | uniq:\ndefaults write -g NSScrollViewRubberbanding -bool false\n\nIt should take effect after reopening applications. It doesn't seem to affect web views like Safari windows though.\n\nA: For anyone else trying to figure this out, this may be of help:\nApple uses the word \"elasticity\" in reference to this part of rubber-band scrolling.  Xcode's documentation includes more details.\nAlso, look into the content of \"/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/AppKit\".\n\nA: Disabling the rubber banding when scrolling past the end of a page can be done.  It simply requires you to ditch your Apple pointing device and use any third party mouse, like my 8 year old Logitech mouse.  No bouncing rubber band effect when scrolling past the end of any page.\nOf course, this means giving up all gestures.  If, like me, you hate the rubber band effect enough to trade away all gestures to be rid of it, run out to the dollar store and get that $4.99 USB mouse.\n\nA: I have found this CSS snippet that apparently disables it:\nhttp://www.smilingsouls.net/Blog/20110804114957.html\nNow to figure out how to implement the CSS rule in every web page we visit... probably via a Safari extension, like QuickStyle or NinjaKit.\nQuickStyle: http://canisbos.com/quickstyle\n\nA: I think the answer is no: you can't disable that feature.\nKeep an eye on third party software like MagicPrefs and Secrets. If anyone figures out how to do it, it'll probably be one of those.\n\nA: This is not an answer, but a hint in the right direction. \nI have a non-multi touch trackpad and I rubber band scrolling is disabled in Lion for me. So this setting is linked to the multi-touch support.\n\nA: Rubber band scrolling cannot be disabled in Lion.\nThe best solution to your issue is probably to use applications that do not include rubber-band scrolling.  Looking around, it appears Chrome and Path Finder do not include this. Many other apps also do not use rubber band scrolling, but this is just a temporary fix as some apps will be updated to include this Lion standard.  \nAnother fix is to stop using a Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, or MacBook Trackpad.  Any other mouse that is used will not have rubber band scrolling.\n\nA: It's somewhere in NSScrollView.NSScrollElasticity\nNSScrollElasticity\nThese constants determine the elasticity behavior for an axis of the scrollview.\nWe need to find a way to set NSScrollView.NSScrollElasticity of every application to 1, which = none.

The key is to use the terminal for it. Apple hides the recovery partition by default in Disk Utility which makes it hard to clone. Fire up your terminal and let's get started.\nType diskutil list and find the partition name for Recovery_HD, it should be something like disk0s3 \nWhat we're going to do with this is create a disk image with dd and then we can use disk utility to restore it to the usb drive.\nType dd if=/dev/disk0sX of=/Users/USERNAMEHERE/Desktop This creates a disk image copy of the recovery partition in a disk image on your desktop.

I had a little difficulty when I initially installed it because the monitor was not turning back on. After re-opening the MacBook Pro (with some difficulty) I closed it up again and it mysteriously worked. \nEverything was going swimmingly, but the only problem now is that the battery is not charging. The adapter shows no light on the bit that connects to the computer. It did like 5 minutes ago, then I picked up the computer and it wasn't charging anymore. I tried setting it back down, wiggling the charger, pressing the bottom case areas around the battery. I'm at a loss.\nI'm also wondering if I should just invest in a new (or in my case, newer used) MacBook Pro because this one seemed pretty rickety inside. There was no stabilizer bar holding the hard drive in place and some of the tabs holding the keyboard frame down have broken off. I don't really have the money, but this is the way I make money.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: If you changed your hard drive appropriately, you would have never touched your logic board, so I would be surprised if it is broke.

Be honest, tell them what happened and they'll open her up and make sure that everything is in its right place and properly seated. Hopefully, you'll  just get slapped with a labour fee. But if it goes further, and things need replacing, they'll be able to quote you. \nAct fast though, afaik those particular machines are soon (or already) going to be \"unsupported\" by Apple, meaning that getting most major parts directly from Apple will no longer be possible.\n\nA: I experienced exactly the same problem after installing a second hard drive (where the optical drive normally sits).\nMy solution was to reset the SMC (System Management Controller) which among other things controls the battery charging circuitry.\nThe procedure is really simple and is described here but depends on the model of MacBook Pro you have.\n", "Q: Unable to create Guest Account after enabling FileVault After upgrading to Lion, I tried creating a guest account and it worked.\nI enabled FileVault on Lion and went through the process of encryption. After that, when I am trying to create a Guest account, the option itself is disabled. \nI am unable to create a Guest account on Lion . I wanted to check if this is the usual behavior with FileVault enabled Macs since I could not find any related articles on this .\n\nA: If you hover over the disabled option, a tooltip appears explaining that the guest account can't be activated with FileVault turned on:\n\nThis is because the new FileVault uses full-disk encryption that's decrypted by the login password of one of the users. As the guest account, by its nature, does not have a password, that would leave your computer completely unprotected. You can still create an account for guest purposes as a regular account though.\nit has been noted that this hover tip may take some time to display and can be difficult to trigger for some people, but regardless of whether or not you can see the tooltip the answer to the question is the same\n", "Q: Where are receipts for App Store purchases on OS X I recently upgraded to Lion, which has been good so far. My employer likes receipts for the things I purchase though. Is there some place where you can see what you bought through the OS X App Store and how much you paid for it?\n\nA: You should get a receipt by Email a couple of hours up to days after you bought something on the App Store. There is no way to tell how long it will take though.\n", "Q: How to disable Developer and Web Searches in Spotlight? Yesterday I upgraded to Lion and it seems it got some additions on Spotlight - the Developer and Web Searches groups. \nSadly I couldn't find a way to disable them. There isn't an option in the Spotlight preferences and I couldn't find the right defaults option. \nAny ideas on how to hide them? They are cluttering Spotlight FAR too much :)\n\nA: As the top answer is a link to a forum post, below is the steps from post in case it disappears one day.\nThe fix below describes how to remove the spotlight developer category without installing XCode first.\nConvert the plist to XML:\nplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spotlight.plist\n\nOpen the file in the editor of your choice:\nvim ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spotlight.plist\n\nJust before </array> at the bottom, add the following:\n<dict>\n    <key>enabled</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>name</key>\n    <string>SOURCE</string>\n</dict>\n\nConvert the file back to binary:\nplutil -convert binary1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spotlight.plist\n\nLog out and back in again.\n\nA: Spotlight thinks you are a 'Developer', if you have Xcode installed, or happened to install it at any time in the past, and hence shows you search results that maybe relevant to a developer. \nWhen Xcode is actually installed and present on the computer, a check-box called 'Developer' appears in the System Preferences > Spotlight > Search Results panel giving us the option to disable 'Developer' results from appearing in our searches. When Xcode is not detected, the check-box disappears from the Preferences Panel, but Spotlight continues to show results from the 'Developer' category. \nI am currently on Yosemite, and had installed and un-installed Xcode way back on Mountain-Lion or Lion, opting to use the 'Command Line Tools' instead. I also had Spotlight disabled until recently, and started getting hundreds of Search Results under the Developer category, once I re-enabled it. The clutter was making spotlight unusable. \nUnable to find a solution anywhere on the Web, this is what I finally tried, and it worked:\nI created an empty file called Xcode.app in the Applications folder, and the missing 'Developer' check-box showed up in Spotlight Preferences, which I could then un-check to solve my problem.\nOpen Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app then type and press Enter after each of the following lines to create the dummy Xcode app\ncd /Applications\ntouch Xcode.app\n\nthen head to Spotlight Preferences and uncheck 'Developer' (you might need to restart the System Preferences app to see the missing check-box appear). \nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*You need to keep the dummy Xcode.app even after changing the\nsetting, deleting it will cause the setting to revert back.\n\n*Another solution would be to install Xcode itself\n\n\nA: I detailed a fix in this forum thread: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1193533\n\nA: Only one solution I could find, block all spotlight web access using little snitch. I guess this is up there with iCloud helping itself to your personal files.\n\nA: Although the Search Results do not have toggles to sort or suppress these results, it's trivial to add the folders to the Privacy Pane.\nPerhaps something like this might work to Suppress the Developer hits?\n\nI don't see an obvious way to suppress the Web Search yet, but thankfully it's placed last as a catch all - last resort. I'll probably feedback / bug Apple if 10.7.1 doesn't address that with a preference.\n", "Q: How to configure 802.1X without a configuration file? After upgrading to Lion, all my 802.1X configurations are gone. There also  does not seem to be a possibility to configure them via the system preferences:\n\nIt just tells me to get a configuration file from my system administrator.\nQuestion:\nHow can I create a profile manually like before, or, if this is not possible, can I create a configuration file myself with the data I have and how?\nUpdate:\nIt turned out that it was sufficient to just provide my credentials at the when I connected to the network. I was just confused as there was not profile anymore in the preferences as you can see in the screenshot above. I hope the accepted answer will still be useful.\n\nA: You need a  .mobileconfig file that includes your 802.1X profile. Acording to apple ( http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4772 ) you can use the Server extensions of Lion to create it. Alternatively (and easier ) the Iphone Configuration Utility ( http://support.apple.com/kb/dl851 ) can also create it. If you upgrade to Lion from Snow leopard any existing profile is migrated. \n", "Q: Disable page curl animation in Lion's iCal I can live with the skeuomorphic skin of the new iCal, but the useless page curl animation when switching months is both slow and jittery. Is there any way to disable it?\n\nA: For some reason, holding Option down with the keyboard shortcuts doesn't work (iCal just beeps at you), but you can change the keyboard shortcuts in System Preferences to include the Option key, then it'll work. \nFor example, I changed the shortcut for \"Next\" from Cmd-Right Arrow to Cmd-Option-Right Arrow and changed \"Previous\" to Cmd-Option-Left Arrow. Now the keyboard shortcuts will navigate without the annoying page flip animation.\nTo do this, go to System Preferences, Keyboard, Keyboard Shortcuts, Application Shortcuts, then hit the \"+\" icon, and enter the following details - Application: iCal, Menu Title: \"Next\", Keyboard Shortcut: Cmd-Option-Right Arrow. Then hit \"+\" again and enter Application: iCal, Menu Title: \"Previous\", Keyboard Shortcut: Cmd-Option-Left Arrow.\n\nA: Press \"alt\" key (⌥) while clicking on the arrows.\nAnd for the pattern there is LionBleacher 1.0 out now for free.\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/39514/lionbleacher\n\nA: Try iCal-Classic-Page-Flip (via MacUpdate):\n\niCal Classic Page Flip\nThe solution to Apples very slooow Page-Flip animation for monthly and yearly view in iCal 5.\niCal Classic Page Flip is a little SIMBL plugin for those of us who are frustrated by the very slow page animation in the latest version of iCal (the one that comes with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion). Both Monthly and Yearly views both have an animation of a turning page, which might be nice on the first look, but it's time consuming and slows down the work flow on the long run. \nThis software is the solution. It disables the painfully slow animation of the latest iCal version and gives you back fast navigation in iCal. Now again, you can use cmd + arrows to move to the next / previous month or year in iCal blazingly fast. \n\n", "Q: Xcode 4.1 installation not customizable? Missing Installation Type Step? Any ideas on how to get around installing that huge iOS SDK in Xcode 4.1?\nThis Q&A suggests to deselect iOS SDK during installation, but the Xcode 4.1 (App Store-Version) Installer seems to have no \"Installation Type\" Step anymore.\n\nA: You can control or right click to show package contents and run only select portions of Xcode 4.1.\nThe program Pacifist will let you look into the packages to see what each contains.\nThe installer has changed to remove the options - it's all or nothing. If space is tight on your boot drive, you will have to either install to another volume and move parts back or temporarily free up enough space to install and clean out what you don't want to keep.\n\nA: As it turms out Apple released a commandline tools package recently, which seems to be exactly what I need: Apple Developer Downloads\n\nA: You can try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on Install XCode.app and choose \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*Browse to Contents->Resources and run Xcode.mpkg\n\n*Customize your install, leave out the iOS SDK, save 5 GB of disk space\n\n*Profit?\n", "Q: Chax with Mac OS X Lion? Has anybody tried Chax with Mac OS X Lion?\nI got it to install perfectly, but I do not see a Chax tab in iChat preferences.\n\nA: I've been in communication with the creator of Chax, and no, it doesn't work on Lion (it definitely works in Snow Leopard). He says he's working on it. \nHis site is here. \nAddendum 9-11-11: The main awesomeness of Chax is the ability to auto-accept Screen Shares with certain people in your Buddy List... including yourself. For instance, if you travel with a laptop and suddenly need to get files from your Mac back home, you simply get a second iChat/AIM account for that laptop, set up Chax on the home Mac, set it up to autoaccept the laptop's account, and you can screen share automatically with your home Mac. I've come to completely rely on that weekly for the past couple years. \n\nA: If you don't see Chax, it might not be compatible. That said, it really depends on what you intend to use Chax for. I suggest looking up the enhancements in the new iChat and seeing if your needs are covered there.\n\nA: you might want to take a look at this. this actually works very well, just like Chax. I love it!\nhttp://scriptingosx.com/2010/11/ichat-notification-with-growl/\n\nA: There's a big ole notice up on the creator's site saying it's not compatible with Lion. Looks like he's working on it though.\n\n\nA: I Actually think that we lost Chax in Snow Leopard so it's possible that it just won't work in Lion either. Apple removed a few of the ways that Chax used to interact with iChat in Snow Leopard so unless the developer has found a way around them you're out of luck.\n", "Q: Force Lion to boot 32 bit mode How can I force OSX Lion to boot into 32bit mode without having to hold 3 + 2 down on boot?\nI have to use the Cisco VPN Client to connect back into work and since upgrading it no longer works on 64bit.

I love CMD-Ö and CMD-Ä (in German keyboards). Navigating through tabs is intuitive and comfortable.\nBut navigating through a command already typed into the terminals a pain in the ... - especially when the command is long. Trying to modify a command - may be correcting a spelling or adding an option flag or something - takes ages, because I have to navigate by cursor and it jumps only several positions per second.\nOn Linux machines you can hold some keys pressed to jump whole words and such. That is much faster. Is it possible to do that on a Terminal of Mac, too?\n\nA: ESC and then B moves back one word\nESC and then F moves forward one word\nYou can change the terminal settings to more sane shortcuts like ALT +  B and such: here's a link on how to do that http://blog.macromates.com/2006/word-movement-in-terminal/\n", "Q: Mac OS X Lion and sshpass I've upgraded from Mac OS X Snow Leopard to Lion. I used several scripts with sshpass but after I upgraded to Lion the following error appears:\n\nPermission denied, please try again.\ndebug1: read_passphrase: can't open /dev/tty: Device not configured\ndebug1: permanently_drop_suid: 502\nssh_askpass: exec(/usr/libexec/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory\n\nI can only connect with sshpass (or type the password manually). No public/private key way. I've reinstalled MacPorts and sshpass.\nHow can I get ssh-askpass? How can I configure /dev/tty ?\nGreets!\n\nA: You should first file a complaint with the server's administration, observing that public key authentication is vastly more secure than simply a password, but I'll assume you've already done so, and your admins are simply idiots.\nApple sadly removed ssh-askpass when they integrated its functionality into ssh, scp, and ssh-add.  There is however an SSHKeychain package that provides an ssh-askpass with an Apple-like Cocoa password prompt for macports' openssh package.  It should fix your problems the way you want, perhaps even setting the SSH_ASKPASS variable for you.\nJust fyi, I'd usually recommend against installing the openssh macports package itself because it break your Apple password prompt, but once you've installed SSHKeychain macports usually offers a more recent openssh than Apple.\nThere is nothing wrong imho with embedding passwords in scripts when the server disables public key authentication, i.e. if they cared about security, they should reenable public keys.  There are even servers that intentionally break sshpass.  You could access such machines using the following expect script :\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\nset timeout -1\nset send_human {.05 0.1 1 .07 1.5}\neval spawn $argv\nmatch_max 100000\nexpect {\n   -re \"USERNAME@(\\[0-9A-Za-z_\\\\-\\\\.\\]+)'s password: \"\n     { sleep 0.1 ; send -- \"PASSWORD\\r\" ; sleep 0.3 }\n}\ninteract\n\nYou may speed up this script by reducing the sleeps and send_human delays.\n\nA: I also ran into a similar problem after upgrading to Mac OS X  Lion. I use Unison to synch a directory on my MacBook Pro with my Linux server, but after the upgrade I could not connect anymore. The problem is that /usr/libexec/ssh-askpass is absent in Lion. To correct this you may go to http://westergaard.eu/2011/07/printing-on-wi-from-mac-os-x-lion/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=printing-on-wi-from-mac-os-x-lion. There you may download the file Printer-hack.zip. It contains the file ssh-askpass that you can then move to /usr/libexec/.\n\nA: The proper way to fix this is to remove all the sshpass stuff you installed and to just rely on what Apple already set up for you.\nBy default, ssh-agent is already running (actually poised to run once you use it, via launchd). You can verify this from the terminal with env|grep SSH which should come back with something like SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/launch-7D4wfP/Listeners. If it doesn't look like that, then you're still overriding the default in one of your shell startup scripts.\nThen, store your SSH key passphrase in your keychain with ssh-add -K. Once that's done, it will automatically load your key into your ssh-agent when needed.\nEDIT: Oops I missed the \"no pubkey auth\" bit and what ssh-pass does. Ok, try setting the environment variable SSH_ASKPASS to a script that prints your password. That will make ssh execute that script instead of ssh_askpass.\nWhat could be going on is that Lion may be stricter about the TTY and it won't accept the environment that ssh-pass provides as a real TTY. If that is the case then ssh-pass will need to be fixed. Perhaps compiling your own ssh may work too.\n\nA: OK, I faced this same issue with AIX as well. The scenario was erratic, sometimes the command would execute and sometimes it would throw the /dev/tty error.\nI worked around it by doing the below:\nI export SSH_ASKPASS to a shell script that would echo the password.\nand then run ./sshpass -p $password $user@$node hostname.\nOn doing this, the cases that ssh complains about /dev/tty it spawns $SSH_ASKPASS and gets the password.\nHope this is useful. I am tempted to think this being more a sshpass bug, but of course haven't debugged more.\nCheers\nSuriyan\n", "Q: How to let Terminal on Mac OS behave show folders and executables and such in different colors? On Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) the terminal shows you executables and folders and such in different colors so you can identify them easier. Is this possible on Mac OS Terminal, too?\n\nA: To add color output of the ls command, you need to edit your ~/.bash_profile and add:\nexport CLICOLOR=1\nexport LSCOLORS=ExFxCxDxBxegedabagacad\n\nThis is just an example, look at the ls manpage on how to change specific color values.\n", "Q: Is the any way to find my stolen Mac? Two weeks ago, my 13\" Macbook Pro was stolen. Is there any way to locate my laptop if and when the thief accesses the internet?\nIs there any application or a website similar to this that can give me an alert message if I register my Macbook pro ID number?\n\nA: It depends. If your machine was password protected, you might be out of luck. If not, there are a few possibilities.\nIf you have SSH enabled that might be an option. Also, if you had any remote access programs installed, like TeamViewer or LogMeIn, you have a chance to find it, assuming it's connected to the internet.\nRegardless, I suggest contacting Apple and telling them the serial number of the machine and that it was stolen. If it's brought in for service, you might be able to get it back. (Although Apple has no official policy on this, it doesn't hurt to tell them. I contacted them when my iMac was stolen. Like I said, not much help, but it's better than nothing.)\nPS: Check this out. You might find it inspiring at least.\n\nA: Good luck getting this taken care of.

When you log into those services from any computer, it logs the IP address used, and displays your last used IP in your account. In Gmail, it's in the bottom right-hand corner under \"Details,\" and in Dropbox, it's in Settings > Security under the details of each individual computer. If the thief used your computer, the last logged IP address may be theirs instead of yours. Again, though, if they're smart, they didn't use your computer and this trick won't work.\nOf course, knowing their IP only gets you so far. You'd still have to file a police report, send a subpoena to that IP addresse's internet provider, and find out where they're located, which could take a long time. Using this method is no guarantee unfortunately Whatever you do, don't try to track the thief down yourself and get your gear back.

The process starts fine, but every time I try it the target computer freezes mid-transfer (at the moment the source computer has shown '9 hours 34 minutes' remaining for the transfer for hours). The target computer's screen is black, and it does not respond to keyboard or mouse input, but I can tell it's on from the fan whir. It does not respond when I press the power button as it would were it asleep or off. I have to hold this down to force it to shut down. I've restarted the whole process several times - what should I do?\n\nA: Since this has failed more than once, it's likely you'll have to effect some repair or change tactics.\nHere are a few that seem likely - you'll have to choose based on your specific situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Migrate from a backup copy of the data instead of the old source mac.\n\n*Remove the hard drive from the old mac and try again. This isolates the drive and your files from the mac and the controller board / cable.\n\n*Look over the failed logs (should be in /Library/Logs/SystemMigration.log) - you might see it hanging on the same step. If so - you could try deleting that data (or you could just delete as much of the data as you can afford to not transfer - especially if some of that data is stored elsewhere on a backup drive)\n\n*Run a repair or check tool on the source mac while it's in target mode. Disk Utility is one tool that could be used to verify the status of the files and disk.\n\n\nDo note, that one possible cause of the freezing could be hard drive failure. If that's the cause, you want to get the important files off first and avoid 'fixing' anything. (Imagine a potential house on fire - you may not have time for everything, so prioritize and just get things out now - organize them later.)\nAll the other causes are not as dire and you may have time to try things again and again, just wanted to plant the idea that this might be a warning so you could get professional help if there are valuable or irreplaceable files on the freezing computer.\n\nA: Transfering over Ethernet and a local area network is always problematic.

It would be nice to have an AirDrop client for Microsoft Windows. Does anyone know if such a program exists as a shipping product or an open source work-in-progress?\nI'm aware that there are many other file sync options, but I'm looking for something that works with Apple's implementation from the Windows OS.\n\nA: As other answers have said there's currently nothing for non-Apple OSes which can talk to Apple's AirDrop.\nHowever there is Snapdrop which offers similar functionality to AirDrop via a cross-platform and open source web app.  It does require the sending and receiving devices to be connected to the same LAN (rather than creating an ad-hoc wireless network like AirDrop) and uses WebRTC (with a fall back to WebSockets) for peer-to-peer communication directly between them.\nMore technical details about it can be found on the GitHub page.\n\nA: I install Pidgin on my Windows machines and enable its Bonjour account, which enables file transfers - including with Macs running iChat.\nAirDrop is Lion-only, but iChat file transfer works 10.4+.\n\nA: No, AirDrop for Win does not exist. I think you could use Dropbox with \"Enable LAN Sync\" option enabled. It will sync your files over local network. If you want to use it at home and in the office, you also might turn on \"Selective Sync\" to avoid large files transfer over the internet.\n\nA: No, I don't believe you can.

It's highly unlikely Apple would open this feature up to Windows or Linux because it's a selling point for them in new Macs running Lion.\n\nA: You can try Transfer on LAN. You can transfer files with machines running on Windows, Mac and Linux because it uses Java. It needs no configuration and it's open source.\n\nA: Try Filedrop. It works for both win and mac computers. www.filedropme.com\n\nA: An alternative to SnapDrop is ShareDrop. Like SnapDrop, it runs on your browser. I believe these two websites only work if you're connected to the same WiFi network/router, which is a possibly disadvantage over AirDrop. However, it works cross-platform.\n\nA: I have a Mac and AirDrop is pretty good, but Windows laptops and PCs can just use peer-to-peer Bluetooth instead.\n\nA: There's Bump. its like airdrop, but you have to bump the phone to the keyboard.\nwww.bu.mp\n\nA: easy way it use iCloud - it's simple and fast.\nOnly need to set it up on a computer and share your screen to you account.\n\nA: If you're a Windows user looking for some of the same functionality as AirDrop, check out Flik. Through it, you can share all sorts of files plus message between friends, like iMessage. Everything happens over wi-fi/internal network.\nAlso, if you're on a mixed network with Windows and OS X users, those on Macs can run Flik from within Parallels or VMware Fusion.\n\nA: You might want to try Dropbox. It works with almost all internet-compatible operating systems, even iOS and android.

Storage is low so i'm hoping to set up for the very first time, a NAS to host large files such as photo's (raw format), video's and music (lossless and aac format).  I require your help in achieving the below functionality.  A list of of hardware/software that I need to achieve the below will be very beneficial as will be those products that would provide very good performance.  I would like most action to occur wirelessly.  \n\n\n*\n\n*I have 1 macbook air, 1 ipad, 2 iphones, 1 cable modem, 1 airport express 802.11n\n\n*Itunes library to be hosted on NAS with writing and reading files to occur wirelessly.  \n\n*When I plug in my iphone or ipad to sync, I would like it to sync and backup with the files on the NAS wirelessly. \n\n*Iphoto library to be hosted on NAS.  When I plug in my sd card, I would like files to be imported to the library wirelessly, which is on the NAS\n\n*I understand iphoto library needs to be sitting on a disk that is formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled).  Does this mean I just partition one of the disks in the NAS and format it to Mac OS Extended (Journaled)? Which products support the formatting of Mac OS Extended (Journaled)? I am only familiar with fat32 and ntfs.\n\n*For photos stored on the NAS, I would like to browse and view the photos on my ipad wirelessly. \n\n\nI am willing to go without iphoto if it turns out that iphoto becomes the biggest challenge.\nThanks in advance, \nRob\n\nA: To keep this general, here are some things to think about:\nDAS: Direct Attached Storage - Thunderbolt, eSata, USB 3.0, FW800, FW400, USB are the rough pecking order. FW400 is better than 100 MB ethernet, and FW800/USB 3.0 are equivalent to Gigabit Ethernet.\nNAS: The network matters - latency over WiFi can be a big bottleneck as can the controller chip / lack of cache in less expensive NAS.\nThink in terms of the bottlenecks - For streaming a song, AirPlay shows you what to expect - a slight delay, but the system can buffer the music to overcome little lags and delays due to network burps. DAS is much more responsive - especially for little file input/output as opposed to streaming a large file or song.\nNAS does offer some nice features like cross platform sharing and with a good network can be shared effortlessly with several clients that don't mind sharing the speed of the device. DAS is designed for one user and optimized for speed - especially for database workloads like iPhoto.\nNAS can be harder to back up, where DAS works easier with whatever backup program you use on your mac.\n\nYour iPhoto database will be the last thing you want to move. It has no provision for splitting the large files from the database files and the latency of reading / writing to the NAS might make you feel the program is too slow. Try it out, but don't be surprised if it's the least responsive by it's design.\nYou want programs that can use local database and thumbnails on the fast SSD and store large original files on NAS or slower storage. \nAperture works amazingly well if you find iPhoto too laggy when stored on the NAS. \nI would start with the iTunes media folder - move that to the NAS and see how you like the performance.\nThen get a tool like WhatSize or DaisyDisk so you can quickly measure what folders on the SSD are largest as you prune things down.\nYou might find you don't need all the audio loops from Garage Band or other surprising folders that make a difference in what you want to bring along on the SSD.\nHave fun with the tweaking - you'll learn how things work. Also, it won't be long until ThunderBolt storage is more available - your NAS might even have a DAS connection for when you really need some speed to access / move files to the NAS.\nDon't forget to back up your NAS. CrashPlan might be a great thing to try for that. \n\nA: The below is based on the assumption that you manage your music the way I do - on its own drive and organized in directories (or whatever) rather than having iTunes set to auto-import and organize things. You can change your iTunes library location but since I own far more than can be synced to my phone I prefer to only add things to the library that I want to sync.\nItunes library on a NAS is no problem. That's what I do at home, using a Netgear ReadyNAS Duo. It can be a wee annoying at times; I had to set my computer to automatically open the drive mountings that iTunes would be using or else iTunes would start, try to open the directory, then timeout while the mount was still happening.\nNot the end of the world; iTunes will figure it out again if you close and re-open it. Otherwise it won't rescan and you end up with this big list of items in your iTunes library with the little ! next to them indicating that they weren't found.\nSync behavior (and everything else) behaves exactly the same with the library external as it does locally.\n\nA: Just a reference for folks who might want to do this via Ubuntu NAS via exported NFS shares which are USB-connected external HDDs on the Ubuntu machine. On my Late 2013 MBP, I store the iPhoto library on the NAS, and the speed at which the photos load etc. are quite good. For reference a large portion of my photos are 35MB or higher, being medium quality scans from a medium format film camera output. I am connected Ethernet (100Mbps) to my local LAN though.\nOn the same LAN setup, samba shared NAS' performance (Ubuntu machine was the samba server) was FAR below my expectations--it was actually just plain unusably horrible. My iTunes library took 48 hours to sync (NFS library took 4 hours), and my photos did not load quickly (preview via finder each took 10 seconds or more to load). I did not try iPhoto on my samba shared local setup because iTunes sucked so badly.\n", "Q: How to upgrade Xcode 4 to 4.1? After upgrading to Lion, I am getting a launch error from Xcode 4 saying it requires Snow Leopard. I see 4.1 is now a free app for Lion in the App Store, but it doesn't show up in Software Update.\nIf I install it from the App Store will it upgrade 4.0 or live side-by-side?\nOr, do I have to uninstall Xcode first if I only want 4.1?\n\nA: You need to install XCode 4.1 from the app store, which will replace XCode 4.0 with 4.1.\nWhen updating XCode to 4.1 you will get a message to quit iTunes to continue the installation. The installation is actually waiting for iTunesHelper process to be terminated. You can terminate the iTunesHelper process using activity monitor.\nOn my Mac the upgrade to XCode 4.1 failed. So I needed to uninstall XCode 4.0 first.\n\nA: For me, it got stuck @ 99%.  For most folks, it still works since it just didn't get the completed notification (by running Developer/Applications/XCode.app).  But for me, it crashed everytime.  To fix it, I had to run Applications/Install XCode.app again (the appstore just installs the application to install it (similar to Lion).  Hope that helps someone else...\n\nA: I downloaded Xcode 4.1 from the app store and installed it with no issues.  Working fine now.\n\nA: *\n\n*Download Xcode from the AppStore (you will get an installer: \"Install Xcode.app\")\n\n*run the installer\n\n*your old /Developer will be renamed into /Developer-old\n\n*into the new /Developer you'll get installed the new Xcode\n\n*thats all\n\n", "Q: How can I install/run apps that use Rosetta on Lion? Is there a workaround to install/use apps that are using Rosetta on Lion?\nI'm still using Zend 5.5 and I don't want to switch to a new IDE right now.\n\nA: You don't need Rosetta to run Zend Studio 5.5.1 on Lion, however, the installer requires Rosetta (which is quite unfortunate).  So long as you have Zend Studio 5.5.1 installed, or migrate it from your Snow Leopard Machine, you can get it running under Java SE 6 by following the instructions here: http://www.s-seven.net/zend_5x_lion\n\nA: At the time of writing Rosetta is not included with Lion, not supported by Lion officially and not available from any other channel (official or unofficial) for use on Lion.\nSo: no, there is no workaround. Your Rosetta-based applications cease to function if you upgrade to Lion.\n\nA: Until someone creates another emulation layer, you could technically run Snow Leopard inside the virtualization software of your choice. Plenty of tech blogs have the steps for various VM choices.\nThe Snow Leopard license has words saying you shouldn't do it and you'll have to hack it lightly since the installer won't run unmodified.\nLion however will be \"running\" the code through rosetta - just not directly.\nDon't overlook avoiding the issue altogether for your development work:\n\n\n*\n\n*keeping an old mac running Snow Leopard and using Screen Sharing to connect  might be much faster than emulation and more \"legal\" if you don't really need to be self contained.\n\n*keeping Snow Leopard on an external or second partition to boot for your development work.\n\n\nA: If you still have a copy of your Snow Leopard install disks, install it on another bootable drive or partition.  Boot from that, and run your Rosetta/PPC apps, then reboot into Lion (which can't run PPC apps) when you're done.\n\nA: Spend 60 seconds and tell Apple that they should SELL Rosetta for Lion on the App store.\nHow would this not be a total win? Fewer people delaying upgrade, enough cash to cover the development and support, more happy customers.\nhttp://Apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n\nA: I am running lion on a 2008 8 core mac pro.\nI used the snow leopard disk to install rosetta as an \"optional Install\".\nIts my understanding that pure ppc code pas will not run in lion; but universal pas with intel code can be installed.\nI was able to install final cut studio 2 this way.\nThe reason I understand this working is because the apps them selves are not ppc but intel or what ever rosetta only had to unlock the ppc installer for me.\n", "Q: Convert bin/cue image to iso format on OS X?

I have a gift card whose balance should just about exactly cover the cost of some repairs Apple is doing on my computer. Is it possible to spend a gift card on repairs? I assume so, but I cannot find any confirmation on Apple's website. Just wondered if anyone on here had any experience to confirm or disconfirm. \n\nA: If the card can be used in an Apple retail store (i.e. not an iTunes gift card), then yes. Repairs are treated as an in-line item in their POS system. Any valid form of payment that could be used to pay for anything else in the store can be used to pay for repairs.\nI called an Apple retail store to confirm this.\n\nA: From the Apple Gift Card Page:\n\nThe pressure's off. Now your friends and family can choose almost\n  anything that Apple offers in its huge collection of Mac and iPod\n  products at any Apple Store in the United States - online, by phone,\n  and at an Apple Store near you.

I am somewhat picky about my filesystem structures. I really, really dislike directories with capital letters.\nI'm more used to Windows where there are a lot of \"special\" folders in the home directory where care must be taken when renaming folders.\nI'm currently using Lion and trying to force myself to use OS X more often.\nI would like to know if its safe to just rename the directories, e.g. Documents, Downloads, Public, Sites. Will the OS know where to look for the new directories? If not, is there a recommended way to do this?\n\nA: As far as OS X is concerned, this is acceptable IF you have selected a non-case sensitive filesystem. \n\nThe non-case sensitive filesystem is the default, so unless you selected case sensitivity during installation of your operating system (or in Lion's most likely case, your previous operating system), you should be fine.\nWhen selecting file system case sensitivity (or not), it should also be known that while the operating system itself will be okay with this, certain applications may not. There are problems using nearly all of Adobe's applications on a case sensitive file system. At the time of this answer, the Adobe Knowledge Base article regarding this issue was last updated roughly 9 months ago (2010-11-03) and this is still the case. Adobe's only answer to the problem was, and remains, to not use case sensitivity.\nIt is possible that other software also suffers from this issue, or may suffer from similar issues if a case sensitive filesystem is used.\n\nA: Before I answer this, a caveat: I have not tested this, just answering with logic.\nIf you have formatted the drive using the default Format Mac OS Extended (Journaled) (not case-sensitive) you should be able to rename the directories and it will not matter to the operating system. You can use Disk Utility in the /Applications/Utilities folder to check the format if you are unsure.\nA final note: I think you might want to check with your local medical practitioner to see if you have OCD. ;-)\n", "Q: How do I remote backup while waking up my computer from sleep? I am backing up remotely from a Macbook Pro to an external backup drive on a PowerMac G5 via Time Machine and AFP. When the G5 goes to sleep, the Macbook Pro can't back up because the drive is made unavailable. How do I get the G5 to wake up while the Macbook Pro is backing up, and to go to sleep after the Macbook Pro is done backing up?\nThe MacBookPro is on Snow Leopard and the G5 (Early 2005) is running Leopard so I can't just use the normal sleep proxy / Wake On Demand or have an airport do the waking up whenever Time Machine tries to connect to the AFP share.\n\nA: You could use cron, or use the energy saver > schedules to wake your power G5 up.\nThis post might help you as well superuser.com this other post might also help you, ont the apple website.\n\nA: The simplest solution to making sure that your G5 is backed up regularly is to disable its going to sleep. In System Preferences, under Energy Saver, you can set the G5 to never go to sleep, and you can un-check the option \"Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible\". This will increase the energy usage of your computer, for sure, but if regular backups are more important, I suggest you consider this solution.\n", "Q: RealVNC on Lion I've been using RealVNC Server on my Mac for years, since it gives me encryption and other features used by RealVNC's clients for iOS and Windows. Once I upgraded to Lion, though, it broke. Now, I see a completely black screen while connected. The cursor moves around fine (which I can see while seated at the monitor, and used as an ad-hoc mouse when Lion initially didn't pair with my Magic Trackpad), but no image comes through.\nI only discovered the problem with the built-in VNC server when I tried falling back on it to temporarily replace RealVNC.\n\nA: Unfortunately seems that Apple has permormed sufficient changes in Apple MAC OS X LION to give it incompatible with the actual Releases of REAL VNC.

And if yes, is it possible to view a list with all of them?\n\nA: It's not a built-in feature so you won't be able to view past logs.  However, you used to be able to enable/disable logging of notifications with scripts I've included below but I don't know if these still work.  If they do, then you could enable logging of future notifications.\n\nEnable Growl Notification Logging:  \n#!/bin/zsh -f\n\nfunction growl_setdefault { defaults write com.growl.growlhelperapp $* }\n\ngrowl_setdefault 'Custom log history 1' \"$HOME/Library/Logs/Growl.log\"\ngrowl_setdefault 'GrowlLogType' -int 1\ngrowl_setdefault 'GrowlLoggingEnabled' -bool YES  \n\n\nDisable Growl Notification Logging:  \n#!/bin/zsh -f\n\nfunction growl_setdefault { defaults write com.growl.growlhelperapp $* }\n\ngrowl_setdefault 'GrowlLoggingEnabled' -bool NO\n\n\nA: just go to growl preferences in system preferences and tick the option to log.

I faced this before, but then, I somehow got rid of it. Now I can't anymore.\nHere's the output of the codesign utility:\n$ codesign -vv /Applications/Indigo/Eclipse.app/\n/Applications/Indigo/Eclipse.app/: a sealed resource is missing or invalid\n/Applications/Indigo/Eclipse.app/Contents/Resources/Eclipse.icns.bak: resource missing\n\nDoes anyone know how can I totally uninstall Eclipse so that the OS forgets about that \"Eclipse.icns.bak\" file?\nThanks!\n\nA: Ok, I managed to do this. It's dirty but pretty safe so far.\nThe database holding that info is located under /var/db/DetachedSignatures. This is an SQLite database, so it can be easily modified using the built-in sqlite3 tool.

I am in the market for a new laptop and have my eye on the new MacBook Air (13\" model). It's perfect in every way, except one. Unlike the white MacBook (RIP) and MacBook Pros, the Air lacks a Kensington lock slot. I spend a great deal of time in cafes and don't like worrying about my laptop while I'm going to the restroom or standing in line to get a refill, etc.\nDo you have any ideas for securing the MacBook Air for use in a public area? I haven't found other options that I find satisfactory.\nI understand the Kensington cable lock isn't a perfectly secure system. (What is?) But it's been enough of a deterrent that I've never had even a concern using my current MacBook in cafes since I got it in 2006. Whereas other friends have had their unsecured, unattended laptops stolen while working in local cafes, I've never had even a hint of a problem while using the cable lock on my MacBook.\nNote: Services like Prey Project are great, and I'm signed up for the service, but I'm searching in particular for a deterrent that will make it so that I don't have to ever actually call upon the service.\n\nA: It is so light, I just rarely need to leave it unsupervised. I'll hand it to the staff to set behind the counter if I need to leave to feed a meter or use the facilities on the rare occasion when I don't have a shoulder bag. \nThey are so light and thin, it's not a hassle carrying it. \nIf you must, audible alarms that plug into USB ports are available, but who wants to be the guy with the alarm going off unintentionally? Not recommended. \nI would bet Kensington comes out with a leash that goes around the display hinge and tightens before college starts in the fall. \n\nA: PNY make a lock for MacBooks:\nhttp://www3.pny.com/category_buymulti.aspx?Category_ID=541\nIt's a small steel plate with a metal tongue that pokes through the screen hinge.  Then a cable lock attaches to the end of the tongue.  A pack contains one cable lock, several tongue pieces for various MacBooks, and a Kensington lock connector as well.\nI bought a set through work, and it fits my MacBook Pro Retina, but I can't get any of the lock parts to slide through the hinge part of my 11\" MacBook Air.  So, not recommended if you have a recent 11\" Air (I guess you should check in store for fit).\n\nA: There are some other options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lockable case - http://www.maclocks.com/macbook-air-lock.html\n\n*Bracket - http://www.snakechicago.com\nThese are compatible with other models such as the MacbookPro Retina.

(It will be used for booting on a stock PC, not on the Mac). How do I go about creating such a drive using a Mac?\n\nA: Open Disk Utility (you can find it in the Utilities folder). Insert your USB drive, and select it in the left pane. Choose the tab \"Restore\" on the right side of the window, drag the image file into the \"Source\" field and the USB drive into the \"Destination\" field. Click the \"Restore\" button.\n\nThat should do it.\n", "Q: Reinstalling software on a brand new (non-formatted) drive - MacBook My sister gave me her old Macbook that had a bad hard drive. I replaced it with a non-Apple drive and tried to install her software on it, but had no luck at all.\nI did successfully load/run Ubuntu, but I already have 3 computers running that. :)\nI read somewhere I needed a USB thumb drive to boot from. Booting from the original 10.4 CDs doesn't work.\n\nA: If you live near an Apple Store - they will often assist you in re-loading the OS that came with that machine since the license for that software transfers with the ownership of the mac. They won't care about a non-Apple drive so long as it works.\nIf not, you will need to locate the appropriate media. Some ideas are buying it from something like amazon or craigs list, ordering replacement media from AppleCare. Lastly, you might find a local tech that would help you, but you will probably end up paying for all of these in one way or another.\nYou might have to do some research to see what the correct OS for your mac is so you can determine which media will work.\n\nA: Your question states that the drive was non-formatted. Did you ever reformat it as HFS (Mac format?) If you simply booted and attempted to run the installer, if the drive is not in the right format it won't work.\nWhen booted to the installer disc, goto the Utilities menu item in the menu bar, and open the Disk Utility application. From there, select the drive from the source list on the left. Under the partition tab, select 'options' to use the GUID partition scheme, and repartition the drive, using HFS as the format. Once that's done, you can close disk utility and the installer should see the drive as a valid destination volume.\nAs bmike stated, you'll need to make sure that you're using valid install media - the discs that ship with each machine are specific to them, so if they are indeed the original discs you should be fine, but if they're from a 'similar' model they likely won't be.\n", "Q: Will FileVault 2 wear out my SSD faster? I'm considering using FileVault 2 when I upgrade to Lion. Though my understanding of it is weak, it seems as though it shouldn't really increase the number of reads or writes per disk operation compared to a non-encrypted drive.\nI don't even know if there's any kind of encryption that would increase reads/writes dramatically, since all decryption presumably happens in memory. But it seemed like something I ought to ask about.\nIs there anything I'm not aware of here that I should be?\n\nA: Depends on your SSD. Some controllers (e.g. SandForce) use compression to lower the number of writes on the SSD. Using encryption generally converts compressible data into a data stream that is farr less incompressible. \nThis ends up resulting in a larger number of writes to the SSD, and consequently will wear it out faster. The compression rates for average data might be 25% at best, so you would presumably see that reduction in life.\nOf course, the initial encryption will also generate writes (about one cycle for each block on the drive), but it's probably nothing to worry about considering that most SSDs are rated for 5000 write cycles.\nWith wear leveling, that 5000 entire drive writes will take a very long time to accomplish even if you choose encryption and have all the writes hit the storage cells without being compressed.\n\nA: Encryption happens on-the-fly.  If the data was written to the hard drive, then passed through an encryption algorithm that then deleted the written data and re-wrote it, encrypted, that would be hella inefficient, and would largely defeat the purpose.  I think the answer to your question is no, but of course remember that if you're going from a data set that's not yet encrypted, then all of that data needs to be processed, so that initial process of reading, encrypting and re-writing data will have an effect.\n", "Q: Can I gift a song from the iPhone iTunes app?

I know officially Logic 8 isn't compatible with Lion.\nHowever, I know you can edit the plist (inside the package), or open it with terminal, to make it open under Lion. And it launches. (See this thread on the apple discussion forums).\nThe question is, is it buggy, and do plug-ins work etc? - It would be great if someone who has tried this could post here!\n\nA: Logic Pro 8 uses some Carbon libraries. Carbon is no longer supported in Lion. That's why Logic Pro 8 is unstable running on OS X 10.7 Lion.\n\nA: As of the current version of Lion (10.7.2) the plist and Terminal tricks are unnecessary. It launches fine from the app icon and has been stable for me.\nWhatever piece of the puzzle was missing, they apparently added it back to Lion in 10.7.2.  Woohoo!\n\nA: I didn't need the terminal to start it, but I couldn't install it using the installer. The installer just told me that Logic Pro is not compatible with Lion. But I was able to simply copy Logic Pro 8 from an older Mac (go to filer -> applications and drag & drop to a USB stick and then again on Lion drag and drop it from the USB stick to applications.\nIt seemed to work fine, but I didn't test it a lot until now.\n", "Q: How Do I Restore the Default Settings in Lion? I love playing with new operating systems, and also love to experience the default behaviour that Those That Be have decreed are the New Best Thing. Up until now, I've always - be it Windows or Mac OS X - nuked my hard disk before installing, so it would be easy to see what the authors had in mind for my new desktop experience. Now I'm married, however, and my wife has an account, files and preferences set up it was too much of a hard sell.\nBut, from my point-of-view, I'd like to reset all the system preferences to what they would have been for a fresh install. Does anybody know an easy way to do this?\n\nA: I would start with a new user - if you felt it was easier to start there - you could always make one good back up, delete both users (keeping a third one for admin purposes) and migrate in your wife's account from the backup. You could make a new account for you and then copy in the files you want quite easily from the backup.\nMost things you need are Documents, Music, Pictures so it's trivial to copy them back from a backup.\nIt's nicer to do this rather than go mucking among all the preference files unless you want to learn that end of things.\n\nA: Starting with Lion, you can install Mac OS X in a virtual machine.\nGo download Virtual Box and boot a new VM off the dmg inside the lion install package.\nIt's a great way to play around with the new system, without actually having to go through all the trouble of installing/configuring all your apps.\n\nA: There are two ways you could achieve this but first open terminal.app and run this so that you can view your Library folder: \nchflags nohidden ~/Library\n\nRename Preference folder\nBackup your ~/Library/Preference folder and rename it then log out. Once you log back in Lion will recreate any preferences it can't find. And when you want to go back just delete the newly created Preference folder then rename your backed up Preference folder back to the original name and log and log back in again.\nDelete com.apple.* files\nIf you want to make the change more permanent but you don't want to mess with third party app preferences you could just go into the Preference folder and delete all the files that start with com.apple. like com.apple.TextEdit. This might be a little difficult since some might be locked.\n\nA: The Launch{Agents,Daemons} preference files are the default, they are not written to.  ( it's in /var/db/launchd.db, one per user. ) \nThus you can blow that directory away, and you will be back to default plist files, unless you modified them by hand, instead of with\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/com.apple.ftpd    #a personal example.\n\n", "Q: How can I stop F8 key from bringing up Mission Control? My problem is fairly simple: Currently both F8 and F9 bring up Mission Control. If I use the System Preferences, it shows that the \"Mission Control\" keyboard shortcut is F9. If I disable this, then indeed F9 no longer works, however, F8 does still work.\nWhere could it be configured that it should use F8, since the System Preferences does not show it anywhere.\nI know that this does not happen for everyone, but it is maddening for me, since I really want F9 to be used for Mission Control, and for F8 to be returned to eclipse…\nUpdate\nThis occurred after an update from Snow Leopard to Lion.\n\nA: I ended up with this problem, too, after upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion. I really needed my F8 key working as a standard function key for my job. I also really didn't want to delete my entire symbolichotkeys plist, though, so I did some digging.\nIf anyone else is having this issue still, you can edit your com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist (located in Library/Preferences) with a basic text editor. Once you're in there just do a search for the number 75. Keys 75 and 76 (76 is the slow animation for when you hold down shift) are the ones for F8 activating mission control. You can just delete those two entries and your F8 key will become just another normal F-Key again. F9 will still work for mission control and you won't lose any other hotkey settings either.\nAs usual, always make a backup of these files when you're messing with them.\nGood luck to anyone else with the issue, and thanks to those here who'd already provided some input and answers.\n\nA: There are two places where mission control's keyboard shortcuts are established: in the mission control prefpane and in the keyboard prefpane. make sure that both of these are set to the desired F9 key and you should be fine. Curious though, doesn't the F3 bring up mission control when not in function key mode?\n\nA: Deleting com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist from preferences solved the problem for me! Eclipse is back to normal.\n\nA: com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist file is located on user's Library/Preferences folder. To get there open Finder window, click on \"Go\" on menu and press \"option\" or \"alt\" key and you will see the Library folder there. Select that Library and navigate to Preferences folder.\n", "Q: New Lion MacBook Air Address Book deletes all entries from MobileMe Contacts on sync Start with a new MacBook Air running Lion. Configure it's address book to synchronize with MobileMe.  The MobileMe contacts list has 374 items, synched from another Mac running Snow Leopard.\nAfter invoking Sync on the MBA, all items are deleted from the MobileMe Contacts, and the MBA Address Book has just two entries: Apple, and the MBA user account.\nThis behavior is the same whether the user chooses Merge or Replace Data on This Machine.\nThe desired result is for the MBA to be updated with the 374 items in MobileMe.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I have a similar issue here, but not involving MobileMe.\nI\n've been struggling to see any of my iPhone 4 (running iOS 5 beta4) contacts appear in Lion's Address Book. It's all empty, whatever I do through iTunes (10.5 beta 4) (either manual syncing of Contacts, or by using iCloud). \nAt least all my contacts are still on the iPhone...  but i'm stuck with a beautiful new Address Book on Lion which has 0 contacts... (or just that \"Apple Inc\" and \"Me\" contact cards)..\n\nA: Although the cause remains a mystery, I have a cure.  At the advice of Apple Support, I used Address Book | File | Export | Address Book Archive on my iMac (Snow Leopard) to create a backup.  The extension for a backup is .abbu (Address Book Back Up I guess).  I put it on my iDisk.  Then I copied the backup from iDisk to the MacBook Air Desktop.  This created a clickable icon with an Address Book image, so I clicked it, and Address Book updated.\nThe next several Sync sessions requested my approval for changes and updates, but now all appears well.\n", "Q: How to get rid of different mouse tracking speeds on dual screen setups I am using a MacBook Air 11\" 2011 Model with Mac OS X Lion hooked up with a Cinema Display 27\" and I am getting two different mouse tracking speeds (I am using a Apple Magic Mouse) when I move between the two screens in a two screen setup.\nI have to move the mouse 20cm to move the cursor from one end of the 27\" screen to the other.\nHowever, I have to move the mouse 40cm to move the cursor from one end of the 11\" screen to the other!\nI can only adjust the mouse tracking speed in the system preferences, increasing it does make it faster on the 11\" screen, but makes it too fast on the 27\" screen...\nAnyway I can fix this? This issue did not occur when I was running a MacBook Pro 13\" when Snow Leopard and the same 27\" screen.\n\nA: I don't think you can. Read this article on TUAW:\n\n\nthat's because the mouse speed option cannot be set on a per-monitor basis. Mouse tracking is controlled as part of system defaults, in the Universal Access preferences pane.\nThe actual preference is called mouseDriverMaxSpeed and can range as an integer between 1 (lethargic) and 32 (zippy). Here's how you'd read the current setting from the command line:\ndefaults read com.apple.universalaccess mouseDriverMaxSpeed\nWhatever number you set to feel right on one monitor will either feel draggy or hyper on the other.\n\n\n", "Q: Will Lion updates be included in the App Store download? I would want to download Lion before I start clearing my system for a fresh install, but would the fixes released in the next few weeks be included in the download?\n\nA: The information page on the App Store shows:\n\nReleased: Jul 20, 2011\nVersion: 10.7\n\nTherefore, I think it's safe to assume that the 10.7.1 update will have to be applied via System Update after installation.\nEDIT\nAs of today, 23 August 2011, the App Store shows:\n\nUpdated: Aug 23, 2011\nCurrent Version: 10.7.1\n\nSo, I guess the fixes are included in the download after all!\n\nA: The traditional software update process is still present in Lion.\nUntil Apple starts actually releasing updates, it's a bit of speculation what will go through that familiar process, and what comes from the App Store.\nOf course, if the App Store lets you download a newer version, you could pull updates from there. The App Store also supports delta updates (just the changes download - not the whole package), supports push notifications (attention - security fix available!), and could also download an installer package that has a delta updater.\nIt's really up to Apple how to send the updates - but there look to be two viable paths available to them for use.\n\nA: *\n\n*History has shown that they make it available in the App Store\nInstaller App (Install Mac OS X Lion.app), by allowing you to upgrade\nthat, they ensure any new installations you might perform use the latest\nversion (assuming you pressed the 'update' button).\n\n*They make both Delta and Combo Updates available through the traditional \"Software Update.app\" program (that does not reside in your Applications or Utilities folder) for your current installation.\nNote: In 10.8 Mountain Lion, it appears that they are moving even more updates to the App Store. For example, 10.8.1 update was d/l'd through the app store only. Then a new updating screen when you clicked 'restart' that replaced the 'update' button in the 'Updates' pane of App Store.app. However, the traditional SW Update app still exists, and may be used for things like firmware updates and other component updates/security updates not part of other programs purchasable through the app store.\n", "Q: How can I get the hexadecimal functionality of Digital ColorMeter back? I often used Digital ColorMeter to capture colours as hex codes for web development. For some reason, Lion's version has removed a whole load of functionality, including this. Some people have managed to copy over the Lion version with their Snow Leopard version, but my Mac tells my that it's required by OSX and can't be deleted. Can anyone work out a way to do the method described by these people?\n\nA: Select View → Display Values → as Hexadecimal:\n\nNow the main window displays hex values:\n\nAlso, Color → Copy Color as Text ⇧⌘C will now format the color like #C8D8E8 (instead of 200 216 232).\n\nA: In lieu of DigitalColor Meter, I've been using an alternative.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up AppleScript Editor\n\n*Enter the words choose color and go to Save. Make it an application.\n\n*You now have a pop-up colour chooser. Unfortunately, there's no inbuilt hex display. Luckily, Waffle Software have made a plugin that gives you the hex of any colour.\n\n", "Q: Why do playlists I create in the iPod app disappear? Every playlist I have made in the iPod app has at some point vanished. What causes this and how do I make them persist?\n\nA: When you create playlists on an iOS device, those playlists get added to your iTunes Library whenever you sync. Once this happens, the fact that they were created on the iOS device doesn't matter anymore as far as iTunes is concerned--they're just more playlists that need to be synced back and forth according to your sync settings for said device. \nOn iTunes, plug in and then select your device in the Devices section. Then, in the Music tab make sure that you have enabled the option to select individual playlists. As long as this option is enabled, you will be able to select and deselect individual playlists. Make sure any new playlists are selected there as well. \nAnother (less common) scenario is when your iOS device is running a much older version of iOS. Previous versions (back when it was still called iPhone OS) had the concept of \"On The Go\" playlists as it existed on the original iPod. If your device still has \"On The Go\" playlists, then the behavior is much different: Those playlists get added to your iTunes library as \"On-the-go 1\", \"On-the-go 2\", etc; on which case they may not be synced up if they're not re-selected on sync screen (Music tab) for your device. The original iPhone and iPod Touch still had \"On The Go\" playlists. \nThose are the two scenarios I know of that would lead to playlists not being synced back. Could you elaborate on what your device type and iOS version is? That may help us troubleshoot your problem better. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Turns out the real problem is when I sync with Foobar. Looks like I'm stuck with iTunes.\n", "Q: Disable a user's ability to unlock a FileVault 2 volume at startup/login time I recently performed a clean install of Lion on one of my Macs. The installation process created one administrative user account. After installation, I enabled FileVault for the entire disk. Then, I created an additional administrative user. Both users are able to decrypt the drive during login.\nHow would I revoke decryption rights to one of the users without deleting the user or temporarily disabling FileVault? I have tried revoking one user's administrative privilege, making them a regular user, but they are still able to decrypt the drive during boot.\n\nA: It is not impossible. (Although if you have deleted user you may have made this more complicated!)\nI wrote the article 'jaydisc' linked to and just tested that it still works in 10.7.4:\nAssume that you have an admin user 'charlie' that you want to be able to use, but not unlock, the computer:\nsudo su - charlie  \n$ passwd \nChanging password for charlie.\nOld Password:**[enter old password here]**\nNew Password:**[press enter]**\nRetype New Password:**[press enter]**\n$ \n\nNote that you cannot do this:\nsudo passwd charlie\nChanging password for charlie.\nNew password:\n\nbecause if you press enter when you get the 'new password prompt' it will come back and say:\nPassword unchanged.\n\n\nA: Use fdesetup:\nsudo fdesetup remove -user username\n\nSee: http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/using-fdesetup-with-mountain-lions-filevault-2/\n\nA: It looks like temporarily removing the users' passwords removes them from the EFI boot menu:\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2011/12/12/prevent-certain-accounts-from-unlocking-filevault-2/\nUnfortunately, in my case, some of the users are Open Directory Mobile users, and I am unable to find out a way to set their password to empty.\n\nA: FileVault 2 and Recovery HD\nRecovery HD not to be confused with the Recovery OS (one is greater than the other). \nWhen you enable FileVault 2 for a user: the non-encrypted hidden Apple_Boot Recovery HD partition, separate from but critical to the encrypted startup volume, is temporarily mounted for writes to EFI-related and other files. If you wish to view this file system activity, whilst enabling a user for unlock purposes: \n\n\n*\n\n*before clicking Done, use a command such as fs_usage or an application such as fseventer.  \n\n\nA glance at the activity suggests that edits to the non-encrypted volume — in relation to the user account on the encrypted volume — are nontrivial. \nIf a user is given inappropriate authority to unlock\nMaybe an update to Lion (something greater than Build 11A511) will provide a way to remove, from the EFI loginwindow, a user who should no longer be able to unlock the startup volume. \nIn the meantime I can think of only two methods that may be used. \nMethod A: disable then enable FileVault\n\n\n*\n\n*disable FileVault 2\n\n*allow backward conversion to complete\n\n*restart the operating system\n\n*enable FileVault 2, but not for that user. \nMethod B: remove the user but not the home directory, et cetera\nI have not tested this method, I imagine that the following might work: \n\n\n*\n\n*backup\n\n*remove the user but not the user's home directory\n\n*restart the operating system\n\n*create a new user with the same RecordName as the original\n\n*set a UniqueID number that differs from the original\n\n*associate the previous home directory with the new user. \n\nA: Here is the very simple answer on how to disable a previously enabled user's access to a FileVault 2 encrypted drive:\nIn terminal, use:\nsudo fdesetup remove -user Username\n\nYou will see thereafter the disabled user in the list of users that are available for enabling in System Preferences->Security & Privacy -> FileVault as verification that the disabling was successful\n", "Q: How can https:// sites be accessed from an iPod Touch behind a proxy server that requires authentication? On my iPod Touch 4th generation (latest generation as of the original time of this posting), when I'm at work, I can successfully access the Internet by connecting to my office's wi-fi network.  The network requires a set of basic authentication credentials to access the Internet.  When I open the browser on the iPod Touch and attempt to access an http:// site, I am prompted for my credentials; after successfully entering my credentials, I am able to continue and access the site.\nHowever, I cannot access any https:// sites.  If I attempt to access https://owasp.org/, for example, I never get prompted for credentials; instead, the browser just does nothing -- the spinning \"loading...\" indicator up at the top of the screen appears, but otherwise nothing happens.  (I can get to this same site fine from my laptop PC connected to the same wi-fi network.)\nThe problem appears to be that the iPod Touch software only supports proxy servers that require basic authentication over http, but not https.\nIs there any solution or workaround allowing an iPod Touch to access https sites through a proxy server that requires authentication?\n\nA: Can you authenticate while accessing a http site and then enter a url for an https site?\nAs in, does the proxy remember your credentials for subsequent sites visited in a single session?\n", "Q: lion: assign buttons on a Microsoft mouse I have an old 5 button Microsoft mouse (Laser Mouse 6000) and forever I've assigned the thumb button to \"back\" in the browser and the middle mouse button to \"next app\" on the desktop. Since I've installed Lion, this doesn't seem to work. The settings in the \"Microsoft Mouse\" panel in System Preferences don't seem have any effect. \nIs there another way to map mouse buttons? I've noticed that Mission Control seems to detect my 5 buttons and let me assign them, but only to Mission Control functions. I don't see anywhere else where I can do this. Do I just need to wait for new MS drivers? Thanks.\n\nA: BetterTouchTool's \"Normal Mouse\" area allows you to assign functions to all kinds of mouse buttons and should work for you. It's free, too, so it won't hurt to try.\nThe author has issued a couple of recent updates to make it more compatible with Lion. There are still a couple of small things but I'm using it every day (previously with my mouse, now with my trackpad) and it's tremendously useful.\n\nA: It turned out I just needed to install the most recent version of the MS drivers. Everything now works like it did.\nThe latest MS Drivers can be found at: http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/downloads (the versions in the MS Downloads Center, and in Google results are older which don't work with Lion)\n", "Q: What is the format for logging into a domain account in OS X? At the login screen, how do I login to a domain account?\nFor example, on Windows the username might be something like louis@contoso.local, where the domain is contoso.local.\nEdit: The AD username happens to be the same as a local username.\n\nA: You need to set up Network Account Server settings in Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options.\nIn the company I work for I can either use DOMAIN\\username or username@DOMAIN when logging in to the AD on from a Windows Machine, but on the Mac this is not required. I just type in username and my AD password, and it logs me in.\n\nA: I've been having the same issue today and I believe I've resolved this (Yosemite).\nI've got my local user (user.name) and my domain user (domain.local\\user.name). I've added to OD auth correctly without issue.\nWhen I attempt to log in with my domain user (domain.local\\user.name) it rejects me for an invalid password. I tried out the password for my local user, and it worked, but threw an error when loading the desktop.\nI've right clicked on the user under \"Users & Groups\" and gone into \"Advanced Options\" (which I found completely by accident). I then modified my \"Full Name\" - which was user.name - to be user.name.local.\nAfter rebooting the machine, all worked and I could log into the domain user with the correct password without issue.\nOne thing to note here is that I didn't have to change the \"Username\" in advanced options here. There may be ramifications to this - see this Apple support KB for more information.\n\nA: You can control this by setting the search order for each domain in the forest. This can by found on the Mac by going to:\nSystem Prefs->Users & Groups->Login Options->Click Edit next to Network Account Server\nThen\nOpen Directory Utility and Click on Search Policy\n\nA: mwidman has given you the answer for this.\nIf you wish to log in to your Active Directory domain account rather than the local account then precede the account name with the AD domain name and a .\nSo in your case contoso.local\\louis\nThis assumes that you have already bound the Mac to Active Directory.

The new MacBook Air and Pro without optical drives lack an Eject key.\nI use Ctrl + Shift + Eject a lot to put my display to sleep at the simple press of three keys. Without the Eject key being there anymore I'm wondering if there's an alternative to those very handy shortcuts which required the Eject key.\nThe alternatives I've found so far are not too good:\n\n\n*\n\n*in Alfred type \"lock\" - too many strokes for fast computer locking\n\n*a hot corner in the bottom left to put the display to sleep - ok, but I get there by error too often and lock the computer for serious productivity bummers\n\n*close the lid of the MacBook Air - puts the Mac to sleep completely and therefore not very useful, when it should keep doing what it's doing.\nIs there a similarly fast alternative to Crtl + Shift + Eject for new Macbook?\n\nA: If you just need to lock the screen, you can use \nControl ⌃ + Command ⌘ + Q\navailable since High Sierra.\n\nA: The easiest way to lock your computer is to set require password immediately and turn off the display with the following key combination:\ncontrol + shift + power\nI find this super helpful and a great replacement for ctrl + shift + delete in Windows.\n\nA: There's a writeup here about using Automator to assign the keyboard shortcut of your choice to lock the screen.\n\nA: control ⌃+shift ⇧+eject ⏏ or control ⌃+shift ⇧+power ⌽ should instantly put your display to sleep. \nI also recomend you to setup hot corner in System preferences -> Mission control -> Hot Corners.\n\nIf you want to put machine to sleep use command ⌘+option ⌥+power ⌽\n\nA: I'm using a MacBook Air 2012 with Mountain Lion, and the new keyboard shortcut is:\nControl+Shift+Power\n\nA: Simple combination for Macs without eject button:\nCtrl+Shift+FN+Power\nDon't forget the FN button (& power replaces earlier Eject)\n\nA: On my 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, none of the key combinations mentioned that use the power button (now the Touch ID button) worked.\nI couldn’t find an existing keyboard shortcut to put the screen to sleep, so I used the software BetterTouchTool (costs money) to create a custom Touch Bar button for it. See the button “Put Display to Sleep” in this screenshot:\n\nI can press that button whenever the BetterTouchTool Touch Bar is expanded. It behaves equivalently to the old Ctrl+Shift+Eject shortcut – it puts the display to sleep immediately, without locking the screen or putting the computer to sleep.\nWhen configuring the button, I gave the button the name “Put Display to Sleep” and set the icon to this blank screen icon from Icons8. The action I assigned was BetterTouchTool’s predefined action “Sleep Display”.\n\n\n(See also my newer answer about creating a custom keyboard shortcut to put the display to sleep. I have stopped using the above custom Touch Bar button because I found it cumbersome to expand the BetterTouchTool Touch Bar when I needed it—I now use only my custom keyboard shortcut.)\n\nA: I just found that I could lock my screen using the following shortcut:\nControl ⌃+Shift ⇧+Power ⌽\nRequire password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins should be checked in the Security & Privacy in System Preferences panel if you want to ensure a slept screen is also securely locked.\n\nA: Another quick keyboard option is to use Alfred to perform basic system commands. However, I've chosen to customise my commands to put exclamation marks before shutdown, restart and logout to avoid the risk of accidentally activating them.\n\n\nA: My current solution is to use a third-party program to assign a custom keyboard shortcut to an action that puts the display to sleep. The program I use to define the global shortcut is Keyboard Maestro (costs money), but many other apps can do that, including the free program Quicksilver.\n\nThe configuration of my “Put Display to Sleep” keyboard macro in Keyboard Maestro\nConfigure your program to run the following shell script when the keyboard shortcut is pressed (source):\npmset displaysleepnow\n\nOr, if your keyboard macro program has a built-in “Sleep Display” or “Sleep Screen” action, you can use that as the action instead, as I did in the above screenshot.\nThe hot key to trigger that command can be whatever you want. I have configured my macro to accept any of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+S – the shortcut I recommend, because it only needs one hand\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+Delete – similar in shape to the old shortcut with Eject\n\n*fn+Ctrl+Shift+Delete\nI would have used the hotkey Ctrl+Shift+Touch ID / Power, but it seems like macOS doesn’t let programs listen to presses of the Touch ID / Power key.\n(If you would rather use a custom Touch Bar button, see my previous answer about BetterTouchTool. I gave up on that solution because I didn’t always have the BetterTouchTool Touch Bar open.)\n\nA: Are you just trying to put the display to sleep, or to lock it? If you're just putting the display to sleep, turning the brightness down all the way works as well. \nBTW Control+Shift+Power does NOT work on my MacBook Pro 10,1 (Retina).\n\nA: On Mavericks (OS X 10.9) I can just use the Power button to put the display to sleep.\nI've tested this on a Mid 2011 Macbook Air and a late 2013 Macbook Pro.\n\nA: On Mavericks, simply press the power button to put the display to sleep or Ctrl-Shift-Power works as well.\nTo put your machine to sleep, use Cmd-Option-Power.\n", "Q: Attempting to run samba with a LaunchAgent - process won't start with system I've installed Samba3 from MacPorts. (following this guide) To run it I execute sudo /opt/local/sbin/smbd -D && sudo /opt/local/sbin/nmbd -D in a Terminal window and everything works fine.\nI've attempted to create a LaunchAgent to run samba with the system, rather than having to invoke it manually. My plist file is called com.samba3.plist and consists of the following:\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n<key>Label</key>\n<string>com.samba3</string>\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n<string>/opt/local/sbin/smbd</string>\n<string>-D</string>\n<string>&amp;&amp;</string>\n<string>/opt/local/sbin/nmbd</string>\n<string>-D</string>\n</array>\n<key>RunAtLoad</key>\n<true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nHowever, on system startup samba is not being run.\n\nA: I see several things that need fixing:\n\n\n*\n\n*This should be installed as a LaunchDaemon, not a LaunchAgent.  The difference is that an agent runs inside a user login session, as the user; a daemon runs independent of who is or isn't logged in, and generally runs as root (which you need here).\n\n*The ProgramArgument list isn't parsed by a shell, so && doesn't do what you want -- it's just passed as an argument to smbd.  You really should make two launchd items, one for smbd and one for nmbd.\n\n*The -D flag to each program tells it to daemonize, i.e. detach and run in the background; launchd expects the things it launches to stay connected so it can monitor them (and in fact will think a program has quit if it daemonizes).  Remove the -D flags, and use -F instead.\n\n\nAlso, if you have Snow Leopard (installed or available) take a look at the launchd items that start the system's version of smbd and nmbd; they're /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/smbd.plist and .../nmbd.plist.  They contain some additional tricks which you may find useful.  Most notably, nmbd is set to auto-relaunch if the network is up, and smbd is only launched on demand when a connection is received.\n", "Q: Why isn't my auto proxy setting working for Safari 5.1 in Lion?

Then set the auto proxy setting to http://127.0.0.1/proxy.pac. If the changes don't take effect immediately or you change the contents of the PAC file at any point in time you need to restart Safari and clear its cache. If this doesn't help, reboot the system.\n\nA: Setting the file again under Automatic Proxy Configuration after entering any junk URL seems to re-read the file for me.\n", "Q: Time Machine Backup to Samba Share under Mac OS Lion In earlier versions of Mac OS you could enable TimeMachine to use Samba-Shares as a Backup-Target using this:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\nand create a backup image with this script.\nSadly Time Machine now says that my drive does not support the necessary AFP protocol. \nIs there a workaround for this? \n\nA: Suspiciously named Msftguy has written a program that fakes the required AFP features for unsupported volumes.  AFAIK this is currently the only way to use non-AFP volumes with 10.7 lion.  Use at your own risk!\nDetails\nExecutable\n\nA: I used this blogpost as a guide, and it works quite well: http://basilsalad.com/how-to/create-time-machine-backup-network-drive-lion/\nThe approach is to create an HFS+ drive image on the network drive, mount it using tmutil, then use it with Time Machine.  Since the drive appears to be HFS+, there should be no issue with using older AFP versions or even SMB/Samba on typical NAS drives and Linux servers.\n", "Q: Is it possible to access a FileVault 2 encrypted volume from Boot Camp? If I switch on FileVault 2 in Lion, can I still access my OS X volume from Boot Camp (Windows 7)? Are both volumes encrypted and decrypted together, or does it only affect the OS X volume?\n\nA: And the correct answer is: No.\nEncryption only affects the OS X volume. Booting into Boot Camp, the necessary password prompt to allow decryption is bypassed entirely. The volume becomes an opaque blob to anything but a running OS X system.\n\nA: In short, yes. John Siracusa from Ars Technica has a very long review of Lion with much more detail. Also, on a recent podcast he said to think of File Vault 2 this way - once you turn on your computer and enter the password (before anything boots) the disk is essentially unencrypted. Time Machine backups, Boot Camp, network access, etc all happens (essentially) unencrypted.\nWhile I haven't tried your particular method myself I have FileVault running and I can access my system just fine in other ways. I hope this helps!\n", "Q: After upgrading Snow Leopard to Lion, can I reinstall the original Snow Leopard to a virtual machine? If I upgrade my Snow Leopard to Lion, is it technically and legally possible to reinstall the original Snow Leopard into a virtual machine, which is inside the same, original, Apple-branded iMac?\nFrom the Snow Leopard software license agreement §2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions:\n\nA. Single Use License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, unless you have purchased a Family Pack or Upgrade license for the Apple Software, you are granted a limited non-exclusive license to install, use and run one (1) copy of the Apple Software on a single Apple-branded computer at a time. You agree not to install, use or run the Apple Software on any non-Apple-branded computer, or to enable others to do so. This License does not allow the Apple Software to exist on more than one computer at a time, and you may not make the Apple Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time.\n\nIt would seem to me* that there's nothing wrong: the working operating system is Lion (not Snow Leopard), so I would enable only one copy of Snow Leopard to run. The virtualization software is running under Apple-branded computer. Right?\nIs it technically possible?\n*) iANAL\n\nA: Yes - it is technically possible. \nThe Leopard and Snow Leopard installers look for a file (even if it's empty) named /System/Library/CoreServices/ServerVersion.plist\nArmed with this, you should be able to search for many \"how-to\" articles like this.\nBe aware, the comments on the page call out issues that this \"hack\" causes when running the OS (software updates is confused by this file's presence/absence) \nLegal and moral issues aside. (I'm not a lawyer but I too fail to see how the license prevents you from virtualizing your legally purchased Snow Leopard on a legally purchased Mid 2011 MacBook Air)\nThink of this as an iOS jailbreak - someone has to stay on top of the things that these changes break, but the payoff may be well worth the hassle.\n\nA: According to §3 Transfer, if you've upgraded you're not permitted to continue using the older release:\n\nIf an Apple Software update completely replaces (full install) a previously licensed version of the Apple Software, you may not use both versions of the \n  Apple Software at the same time nor may you transfer them separately.\n\n", "Q: Internet stops working frequently on OS X Lion After upgrading to Lion, I started experiencing this issue:  \nInternet stops working frequently.\n- I open Safari and browse for some time\n- Suddenly I can't open any sites; Internet will stop working.\n- So I check WiFi; it is online and showing correctly in my MacBook Pro.\n- I check with my roommate and his Internet is working properly.\n- I switch to Google Chrome and it still doesn't work.\nThe solution is to turn WiFi off and back on, then restart my browser.\nDoes anyone else have this problem? Is this a bug?\n\nA: This is currently a known issue that lots of Lion users are reporting. The average seems to be 2 wifi dropouts per hour.\nThe current work around is (as you discovered) to toggle AirPort on/off.\nThis particular issue seems to be getting alot of attention so I'd expect a fix soon.\nApple support forum topic about this issue\n\nA: This response describes a fix that worked for me:\n\nOpen up preferences and go to network. Make note of your settings as\n  you will have to rebuild them.\nRename the preferences.plist to .old\n  which can be found here: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/\nNow\n  go back to preferences and rebuild your settings as it will be blank.\n  You may have to manually recreate a new location and then hit apply.\n  This recreates a new preferences.plist\n\nAfter this, I also had to reboot, and the problem went away.\n", "Q: Where are the dictionaries of Mac OS X's built in password assistant? Mac OS has a built in password generator. It is a little bit hidden behind the key icon in System Preferences / Accounts / Change password. The memorable option is quite nice as it even conjugates words (my screenshot shows the German version):\n\nMy question is: Where does this helper get its words and even variants of words? Is there a complex dictionary where it can look them up for the specific language?\n\nA: I've only used OSX in it's English settings. OSX has an inbuilt dictionary for system-wide spellcheck, definitions etc. I imagine it uses this for memorable passwords, with the Size slider determining the limit on the size of the words that are plucked from said dictionary.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for Spotlight doesn't work in full screen Google Chrome on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) I've noticed that the Spotlight Search keyboard shortcut (cmd space) doesn't work if I'm running Google Chrome (12.0.742.122) as full screen application in Lion.\nIs this a Chrome-related bug or is this inherent of some type of applications? Is there a way to fix it?\n\nA: Chrome doesn't currently support Lion's full screen features. They are working on a version that does.\nUntil that is finished, you'll have to use Chrome's built-in full screen capabilities (not based on Lion's).\nYou can change the keyboard shortcut to enter that the same way you'd change any other (System Preferences-> Keyboard-> Keyboard Shortctus-> [+] button\n\nA: Problem seems to be resolved in newer Chrome versions.\n\nA: No such problem with Safari (just tried it). the way to fix it: just switch to safari :P it's the same webkit rendering engine as chrome (meaning it's the same speed) and now it's a whole lot nicer with some of the new lion features\n", "Q: Should I restore my data before or after upgrading the OS? (Part 3 in my ongoing Lion upgrade/hard drive replacement saga...)\nWhen I get my computer back in a few days, it will have a brand new hard drive with a clean Snow Leopard install. I will be upgrading the OS on the new drive to Lion. I have complete backups of my old drive on a Time Capsule, automatically backed up now and then by Time Machine. Should I restore this data before or after upgrading the OS? Would restoring Snow Leopard backups to a drive running Lion cause any problems?\n(I am leaning toward getting the Lion upgrade out of the way first, just in case anything goes wrong, and then restoring my data to its new home.)\n\nA: It won't matter as far as the software goes since Lion runs the migration script one time only on your Snow Leopard data whether you migrate it in from a backup or it's there when you do the upgrade to Lion.\nFrom a human standpoint, I would encourage you to make a \"test\" account (pick a different short name to prevent conflict or confusion when migrating your \"real\" account later) \nUpdating and testing Lion lets you build confidence the Lion is working on your repaired hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Snow Leopard updates to 10.6.6 at least to get the App Store if needed\n\n*Install Lion\n\n*Run all updates\n\n*Test Lion in the test user. Once you're happy it works, migrate in your user data.\n\n\nThere's no right or wrong here - so do whatever makes the most sense to you. You've had a rough spell with the first upgrade / hardware failure - no need to over complicate things unless you really feel more steps is better.\n", "Q: Does changing a daemon's plist file extension prevent it from being loaded? I particularly want to disable:\n/private/etc/mach_init.d/dashboardadvisoryd.plist.disabled, but in general for any daemon.\nDoes changing its plist extension prevent it from loading?\nIn the past I moved them to a different folder, but this is more convenient.\n\nA: launchctl list and sudo launchctl bstree will show you the jobs. You'll need to read up on the mach_init part as well as be aware that launchd gets more and more of the pie as you go from Tiger/Leopard/Snow Leopard/Lion - your in general question is basically \"walk me through launched\" - The command mdfind dashboardadvisory will search in the areas hidden by default in spotlight as system files.\n@bmike\nPS: post it as an answer if you want, so I mark it correct.\n\nA: You can also disable a given LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon with launchctl without renaming the file.\nsudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.whatever.you.want.to.disable.plist\n\nIf you omit the -w, it'll only disable the task for the current boot. This is handy for testing if disabling a launchd task will fubar your system - if you run into trouble all you'll need to do to fix things is reboot, and things will be back to normal. Otherwise you'll have to boot into single user mode and manually edit the plist to re-enable the launchd task.\n\nA: The answer is yes. OS X looks only for plist files when loading LaunchAgents or LaunchDaemons, regardless of whether you use the old style \"Mach\" way (which as bmike has pointed out has long been deprecated) or the current, modern method.\nThe contents of the plist file are as follows (this shows the AELWriter service):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.apple.aelwriter</string>\n        <key>MachServices</key>\n        <dict>\n                <key>com.apple.aelwriter</key>\n                <true/>\n        </dict>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n                <string>/usr/sbin/AELWriter</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <false/>\n        <key>UserName</key>\n        <string>root</string>\n        <key>ThrottleInterval</key>\n        <integer>2</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nYou can see that what actually launches the service is a string under the key ProgramArguments. Changing that value would also \"disable\" the service from running, as would removing the plist, renaming the file extension, or deleting the file outright.\n", "Q: After Lion can't access NTFS shared folders any more After upgrading to Lion, my NTFS shared folders are no longer accessible. I can see the shared folder, but when I try to enter from Windows 7 box it says Windows cannot access \\path\\to\\usbsharedresource.\nEven BOOTCAMP partition which was shared and working now inaccessible... \nSMB is ON.\n\nA: Upgrading to Lion breaks SMB.  Something to do with UUIDs or GUIDs I think.\nCreate a new user on the system, give that new user access privileges through the SMB share, and connect to the share using the new user name/password.  Accounts that existed pre-Lion upgrade won't work due to this UUID problem.\n\nA: MacFuse is broken in Lion.

Before, on Snow Leopard, when unplugged I had minimum 5hrs of life. Now, it's not much above 4hrs at best. Is this a common problem?\nI notice the estimate battery life now fluctuates a lot more than before, too.\n\nUPDATE\nBattery life is definitely lower than before upgrading. I'm getting up to about 5hrs of work now while I was able to pull out 6-7 before.\nRe RAM usage. I'm not a heavy RAM user tbh. I always have at least 0.5GB RAM completely free and most of the time it's around 1GB free at least so this can't be it.\n\nA: Rather than looking at the estimated time remaining, use your machine to determine if there is an actual difference or if it's just a change in the battery-life-remaining algorithm\n\nA: Yes!\nBoth me and my girlfriend have had the feeling that the battery life has decreased significantly with Lion on our 2010 MacBook Pro's, compared to Snow Leopard. Especially when the machine is \"sleeping\" (when you just close the lid). Unfortunately, we don't have any numbers to back this up (yet).\nI've been trying to determine what the problem could be, but it's a bit tricky due to the sheer amount of variable factors. We're pretty much running the same applications as before, and nothing seems to be out of the ordinary when examining the running processes and hardware utilization. We've both got 8GB or RAM, which should be more than enough for Lion (it doesn't write to scratch).\n\nA: Lion is said to run best with 4GB of ram. Snow Leopard didn't demand that much. I haven't tested Lion on older systems, but it is logical to conclude that because it demands more of your machine it will decrease battery life.\n", "Q: Startup disk has no more space available for application memory? I purchased a new Macbook Pro (8,3) last April, and have been using it heavily for xcode development, and little else.\nThis morning a message popped up:\n\"Your Mac OS X startup disk has no more space available for application memory\"\nIt then suggests closing applications and removing files from my startup disk.\nI presume this means virtual memory, however my disk has 600.26 GB available, according to Finder. I do have a time machine backup disk attached to the computer as well, but it has 664 GB available.\nWhat does this message mean when there is certainly plenty of disk space remaining on the primary hard drive?\nI have 8GB of RAM, a 750GB hard drive, and am running OS X 10.6.8. If any of the other system info is pertinent, let me know.\n\nA: I've seen that message in programs like Photoshop that have their own virtual memory systems rather than just assuming the OS can handle RAM and memory allocation.\nA reboot should clear things up. (safe mode boot might be nice if you want to run a full disk repair pass and then reboot normally)\n\nA: I've had the exact same problem. Running \"Repair permissions\" in Disk Utility cured it.\nMy problem was probably caused by using CleanMyMac which messes around with booth system and app folders.\n\nA: If you have a relatively new HP printer, the software that came with it can cause a massive memory leak. I have a 2 year old 27\" core i7 iMac that suddenly started giving me the same error message. I tracked it down to the HP software.

Is it possible to use Time Machine via AirPort Disk without storing the backup in a sparse bundle? I've had bad experience with sparse bundles and would like to avoid them. \n\nA: It's not been shown (yet) how to hack apart the Time Machine process on Lion sufficient to do what you ask (skip the sparse storage format).\nI too was bitten by early network based sparse bundles. Since mid 10.6 (maybe 10.6.5) - I've been unable to break Time Capsule based despite repeated tests to be really mean. This includes pulling the power of the capsule in the middle of backups repeatedly to regain confidence. This isn't something I'd do on my main backup, but the Snow Leopard implementation is now rock solid in my eyes.\nRealize that by having a less reliable network, this sparse format is actually more reliable overall and has checks and balances to make sure you get a good backup even when bad things happen.\n", "Q: Will my Canon CanoScan 500F scanner work with Lion?

One of the little things in Lion I was most excited about was the Finder's new \"Date Added\" field. I wanted it for two folders in particular, for obvious reasons: the Downloads folder and the Trash. \nWell, it works in Downloads, but as far as I can tell, not so much in the Trash. Now, when I first booted into Lion, Date Added didn't work anywhere. I suspected that it was because Spotlight wasn't done reindexing yet. Now that it's finished, Date Added is populated on new downloads, but still not in new Trash items.\nLooks like it simply doesn't work. But maybe Spotlight is not the only thing involved. Am I missing something? Or am I doomed to futilely hoping they incorporate this in a point update?\n\nA: The answer was basically in my original question. Spotlight is indeed the sole arbiter of the Date Added column. And the Trash, not being a real folder, is not Spotlight indexed.\nIf you move a file with a Date Added into the Trash, it keeps the Date Added from its original folder. If you then put it back, its Date Added (to the original folder) is updated to the present.\nIt would probably take a significant engineering effort to make this work for the Trash, so I'm not expecting to see this fixed before Mountain Lion, if ever.\n", "Q: Why is Preview excessively slow after upgrading to Lion? After upgrading to OS X Lion, I noticed that my preview app is now excessively slow, taking minutes to open a file instead of seconds, even when opening a local file. In addition, it is often unresponsive.\nWhat is the cause of tis, and do I have to reinstall Lion to fix this issue? I'd rather not go through the whole process again if possible.\n\nA: OptCmdQ worked for me on a new Macbook Pro i5 2.4Ghz\nI can only presume that discarding the previous windows cleaned out something that was causing the app to run slowly.\n\nA: Using the fs_usage command to view file system activity\nIf you're happy working in Terminal, a result from the following routine might help to estimate the causes of slowness. \n\n\n*\n\n*open Preview then alt/optioncommandq to Quit and Discard Windows\n\n*in Terminal, open a new window\n\n*paste the following line to Terminal then key return or enter \nsudo fs_usage cmd Preview\n\n*if prompted, enter your admin password\n\n*observe the hints for usage — you probably won't need them now, but it's good to be aware of them\n\n*key up to represent the same line but do not return or enter \n\n*be prepared to bring Terminal quickly to foreground\n\n*in rapid succession: click the Dock icon for Preview — bring Terminal quickly to foreground — key return or enter\n\n*at your leisure, when Preview is ready: open a file that you associate with delays\n\n*after that file is open, key commandw to close the window\n\n*after the window closes, key commandq to quit Preview\n\n*bring Terminal to foreground, maximise the window then key controlc\n\n*if you see nothing confidential or sensitive in the Terminal window: select all text, copy the text\nthen: \n\n\n*\n\n*edit your question to include the pasted text. \n\n\n\nScreenshots\nExamples of Terminal as it might appear after steps (6), (8) and (12): \n\n\n\nOther readers\nIs there a smarter or more user-friendly way of getting similar information? \nIn this case I aim for fs_usage because its output includes time stamps, which could help to understand the points at which delays are most noticeable. \nReference\nfs_usage(1) Mac OS X Manual Page\n\nA: Before you reinstall, why not do a couple of easy isolation exercises - the network, other processes or your user account could be the issues and none get resolved with a reinstall.\nLion has obviously made Preview app do more things. It tracks open files so they get opened again at the next launch, it has smarter detection of data, a new loupe - your mac might just have more to do and this could be the proverbial \"straw that has broken the camel's back\"\nRather than just reinstall - you might poke a bit to see what it really going on. Are there other background processes? Is it still indexing the hard drive?\nThe order here might help, but feel free to do whatever makes sense: (you'll run your preview test after each of these steps)\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the network (all of them if needed)\n\n*Log out and back in\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Make a new user\n\n*Safe boot\n\n\nThere are some great but exhaustive procedures on isolating a software issue on apples support sites, but these are a few that might fast track you in ruling out this one issue. \nIf preview is slow with nothing else going on - you have a good chance at figuring out why. Best luck in chasing down the culprit.\n\nA: I had the same problem and managed to resolve it disabling the \"resume\" feature. This can be done system wide, but to solve just the Preview problem, type this in the Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false\n\nYou might need to go to the ~/Library/Preferences folder for this to have effect (for me it didn't work at first).\ncd ~/Library/Preferences\n\n\nA: I was having this issue with OS X Lion 10.7.3 2GB RAM in a MBP. I tried the above terminal steps but couldn't find anything there.  I was reading through my code and noticed that it named \"font\" early on in the terminal output.  I recall having duplicate fonts in the past causing issues in Snow Leopard.  \nWhat to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up Font Book (spotlight search) and selected All Fonts in the Collection column.\n\n*Scroll through the Font list and look for a font with a yellow triangle indicating that it is a duplicate.\n\n*Click on the triangle and choose remove automatically.\n\n\nPreview and TextEdit now open much much faster.\n\nA: Try this: it made a big difference on my Mac.\nUnder Preview, Preferences, General, select Open each file in its own window.\n\nA: Just stumbled on an answer that worked from me on the apple.com forums:\nIn Preview, select File -> Open recent -> Clear menu.\nWhen I restart after doing this, it's lightning fast again.\nUnfortunately, this is a manual fix; the menu will clearly fill up again and slow Preview down, so Apple has some work to do to get this fixed. But at least there's a way to clean it up from time to time.\n\nA: If you have Axiotron Quickscript installed you will need to disable/remove it until they supply a fix.\n\nA: I would consider this a bug in Lion, probably related to the auto-quitting of apps introduced with Lion. \nI have a similar thing happening, does it sound familiar? \nI open a file, which activates Preview. I see my last opened documents, and a grey overlay over them, with a spinner. \nWhat helps me is force quitting Preview, and reopening the file.\nPreview is definitely eager to close itself in Lion, see this tidbits article for more info: http://tidbits.com/article/12398\n\nA: As described by others, one possible reason for slow performance of Preview under Lion is related to the new resume feature. This can be disabled in multiple ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*temporarily by closing Preview using OptCmdQ which causes a clean Preview on next startup. \n\n*Permanently for Preview only using the Terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false [but see note below] or\n\n*Globally for all Applications from the General System Preferences [but see note below]\n\n\nBut, in my experience with a similar slowdown in Preview (5.5.1) after a recent upgrade from Snow Leopard to Lion (10.7.3) you may need to use Multiple Techniques. Specifically, Even after I disabled resume for Preview from the command line and globally in systems preferences, I still experienced very slow Preview performance until I also closed preview using OptCmdQ. Now finally, Preview is back to running fast.\n", "Q: How can I delete \"Passenger\" from my \"System Preference\"?

Why no vmnet8? Why is vmnet8 getting a routable address? shouldn't it be one of those non-routeable 192.xxx.xxx.xxx or 10.xxx.xxx.xxx numbers? And even if windows is bridged and using 192.168.1.42, little snitch on the mac keeps asking if vmnet-natd can talk to the net so i know it's active.\nI can see packets going to the windows ip but it's mixed in with traffic going to the mac (as I'd expect since they are both using the same airport) but it's all going over en1.\n( btw, i dont understand why the gateway in windows is not 172.16.143.1 but rather .2 - after all doesnt the windows box have to talk to vmnet8?)\nThe same situation exists when one uses parallels instead of fusion. Except in this case 2 vNICs show up in wireshark. However, they are silent and never used either.\n\nA: Well, the VMWare people said that those interfaces are invisible to wireshark and a special tool, VMWare-sniffer, can be used.\nAnd btw, 172.xxx.xxx.xxx are non-routable addresses so clearly I had a buffer overflow in my brain.\nAs for the .2, that's just the way VMWare set it up.\n", "Q: Is it possible to download Snow Leopard? I see that Snow Leopard is available in a box sent through the mail.\nIs it also possible to download Snow Leopard from somewhere? So I don't have to wait for it to be mailed to me.\n\nA: Unless you're part of the Apple Developer Program, or you have access to a server running in an enterprise environment that is licensed to distribute copies of OS X, no.\nSince OS X Lion is newly released, you will likely find less and less support for Snow Leopard from this point forward.  Lion is, as of now, distributed ONLY via download, so you may want to consider just getting Lion unless you need Snow Leopard for a spec\n", "Q: Password dialog appears when SSH private key permissions are set to 0600 I installed my SSH private key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa and set its permissions to 0600.  When I connect to an SSH server which uses my private key in Terminal.app via ssh, a dialog pops up and asks me to enter my password to access the id_rsa file:\n\nI see the same dialog when I connect to an FTP server with the Interarchy GUI client.\nUpdate: I see this dialog every time I connect regardless of whether I check \"Remember password in my keychain\".  It appears two more times if the OK button is clicked regardless of what is entered in the password field.\nWhen I relax these permissions to, say, 0640, I no longer see a dialog asking me for my password but ssh aborts with the following error:\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nPermissions 0640 for '/Users/myusername/.ssh/id_rsa' are too open.\nIt is recommended that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.\nThis private key will be ignored.\nbad permissions: ignore key: /Users/myusername/.ssh/id_rsa\nI find the password dialog extremely annoying and I am sure there must be some way to avoid having to dismiss this dialog SSH needs to access the id_rsa file.\nNote: I am running Mac OS X 10.6.8.\n\nA: First, run ssh-add -K and check whether this fixes your problem.\nIf not:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed the rsa_id.pub file and regenerated a new one (must be in ~/.ssh/):\nssh-keygen -y -f id_rsa > id_rsa.pub\n\n\n*Ensured permissions were set to 600 for both id_rsa and id_rsa.pub (must be in ~/.ssh/):\nchmod 600 id_rsa*\n\n\n*Ran the following command:\nssh-add -K\n\nAfter doing this, I was no longer prompted to give my private key password. This appears to actually put the private key password in the correct keychain location for OS X to use.\n\nA: When you relax the permissions, the key is ignored. You won't gain anything by doing this.\nIf you want to use a key without having to enter a password every time, you have two options.\nIf you check the “Remember password in my keychain”, you won't have to type the password every time: it'll be stored in the keychain with all your other passwords. This is the recommended option.\nYou can create a private key file without a password. You can change your existing private key file so that it isn't password-protected (changing the password only affects the key file, not the key itself). From the command line, run ssh -p, enter the existing passphrase, and then leave the new passphrase blank. There is a security risk in having an empty passphrase: anyone who can access your private key file (for example by accessing your backups) can use it instantly.\n\nA: Make sure you have a corresponding id_rsa.pub or id_dsa.pub in your ~/.ssh directory.\nWhen I had an id_rsa but not a corresponding id_rsa.pub, Mac OS X kept popping up the dialog and remember passowrd in my keychain did nothing.\ncd ~/.ssh\nssh-keygen -y -f id_rsa > id_rsa.pub\n\ngenerated the appropriate public key file for me.\nIf you already had your public file there (rename it to another name) and generate the public key again using the above command, you'll notice that the generated and the old one are not equal. Somehow the older versions of Mac OS X generated a public key that Lion does not like anymore, generating it again fixes that.    \nFor the curious, the key is exactly the same, the part that changes is that there is no \"comments\" section after the key on the file any longer.\n\nA: if you have added your private key to the source ~/.ssh directory, and you have entered ssh-add -K to add it to the keychain, and you have your public key contents copied to the .ssh/authorized_keys (for the correct account) file on the target server the dialog box goes away.\nit's a tricky combination of files, permissions, locations, and commands so it can take time.  i would not rush to a conclusion about bugs.\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem on Lion (Mac OS X 10.7). I think is a bug...\nIf the ssh authentication is password the client goes through public key first which is normal. However, even though you choose to save the passphrase on keychain (which is not required for the password authentication) next time when a new ssh connection is established you are asked again for the passphrase...\n\nA: There should be no need to regenerate your public keys. You can simply do these two commands:\nchmod 0600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nBasically, you need to tighten the permissions on the public key file, and you need to add your key to OSX authentication agent.\n\nA: In the latest version of macOS (10.12.2 - Sierra) this is an easy fix. Just edit your ~/.ssh/config and enable the UseKeychain option:\nHost *\nUseKeychain yes\n\nSave and solved.\n\nA: In my case ssh-add -K didn't do the trick, I had to specify the key:\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Be sure that ~/.ssh/ is chmod 700.\n\n*Be sure ~/.ssh/id* files are both chmod 600.\n\n*Run /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app and repair keychain.\n\n*Logout. (Rebooting wouldn't be a terrible idea)\n\n*Login\n\n*If the problem persists, move your existing ~/.ssh/id* files to your Desktop and try generating new keys using ssh-keygen -t dsa -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa -C you@youremail.tld and see if the new keys work better.\nI'm on Lion, but IIRC Snow Leopard worked the same way.\nps - anyone who suggests using a blank ssh passphrase should be forced to wear a sign so  other people know not to take advice from them.\n\nA: This problem occurred on my OS X 10.7.4 system when ssh-agent died.  A reboot fixed the problem.  (You could try restarting ssh-agent, but I don't know if the Keychain is clever enough to pick up the new ssh-agent socket.)\n\nA: For macOS 10.12 Sierra ssh-add -K needs to be run after every reboot. To avoid this create ~/.ssh/config with this content.\nHost *\n   AddKeysToAgent yes\n   UseKeychain yes\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nApple has added Technote 2449 which explains what happened.\n\nPrior to macOS Sierra, ssh would present a dialog asking for your passphrase and would offer the option to store it into the keychain. This UI was deprecated some time ago and has been removed.\n\nEdit: Apparently specifying a host and key isn't necessary. Just adding this is enough.\nAddKeysToAgent yes\nUseKeychain yes\n\n\nA: You have to enter the passphrase for the private key somewhere, and OS X uses ssh-agent by default.\nIf you want to use ssh-agent but want to avoid the gui dialog box, you can use ssh-add to add the passphrase to the agent and then ssh as usual.\nIf do not want to use ssh-agent and instead have ssh prompt for the passphrase, then unset the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable.\n\nA: Regenerating the public key does not seem to work for me (10.8), nor does generating a new SSH key.  If I, for instance, run git pull after locking the login keychain a dialog box pops up to demand the password to the key instead of first attempting to retrieve the password from the login keychain.\nHowever, if I kill ssh-agent first, I'm prompted for the login keychain password which then retrieves the SSH key password.\n\nA: Another interesting finding is if you copy & paste the content of the PEM file, you might have the ending missing the dash.  So just remember to add the final line as,\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n\n\nA: I had to do the following steps in order to make it work.\n# Change working directory\ncd ~/.ssh\n# Remove the old public key\nrm id_rsa.pub\n# Create a new public key\nssh-keygen -y -f id_rsa > id_rsa.pub\n# Change permission\nchmod 600 id_rsa*\n# Add the key to ssh\nssh-add id_rsa\n# Then finally test it (I used github)\nssh -i id_rsa.pub git@github.com\n\nThe final command should then output something like:\nHi <user>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  I seem to have fixed it by doing this.\n1) Backed up by renaming to old the id_dsa and id_dsa.pub files.\n2) Ran a new keygen with a blank passphrase.\nWorks with the launchctl period job monitoring a remote server as well as logging in from ssh in a terminal.\nI have a quick function authme function in my terminal since I have the following in my .bash_profile\n#~/.bash_profile    \nfunction authme {\nssh $1 'cat >>.ssh/authorized_keys' <~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub\n}\n\nSo a quick authme remoteserver.com will copy the new remote key over.\nI think the bug is something to do with the passphrase not being converted over (my old Snow Leopard didn't have one at all).\nTry that and see if it helps.\nIt didn't take more than 10 mins to do.  I spent googling forever to see if there were any other mentions of this.  This site was the only one!\nOwain.\n\nA: I had a similiar problem. It turned out that the private key I was using was in a wrong format. I used PuTTY Key Generator on my Win machine and ssh on OS X expects a different format - Open SSH format.\nIt turned out that the tool I used to generate this key (PuTTY Key Generator) had an option to convert my priv key to the format required by Open SSH.\nSimple as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open PuTTY Key Gen\n\n*Load your private key\n\n*Select Convertsions > Export OpenSSH key.\n\n\nThe file you will save contains your original private key in proper (OpenSSH) format.\n\nA: Please make sure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are using pem format for your private key. This is because Mac uses openssh client which works with pem. ppk is putty's proprietary format and is not compatible with openssh. You can easily convert ppk to pem using putty keygen, in case you have only ppk.  \n\n*The permissions on your pem file is 600. Private keys are only meant to be accessible only by their owner. So, if the permissions give read access to any one else, it will be deemed a security threat.\n\n\nThis should hopefully resolve the issue.\n\nA: Use the .pem key rather than the .ppk key.\n", "Q: How can I use LaCie USB Key \"Private Volumes\" with 10.6.8/10.7?

Any suggestions?\n\nEDIT: I grepped for \"backup\" in the log messages (/private/var/log/system.log) and got the following from the last backup (which I cancelled):\n24/07/11 14.42.22,185 com.apple.backupd: Starting standard backup\n24/07/11 14.42.24,013 com.apple.backupd: Attempting to mount network destination URL: afp://Thorbj%C3%B8rn%20Ravn%20Andersen@Thorbj%C3%B8rn%20TC._afpovertcp._tcp.local/Data\n24/07/11 14.42.31,097 com.apple.backupd: Mounted network destination at mountpoint: /Volumes/Data using URL: afp://Thorbj%C3%B8rn%20Ravn%20Andersen@Thorbj%C3%B8rn%20TC._afpovertcp._tcp.local/Data\n24/07/11 14.42.35,981 com.apple.backupd: QUICKCHECK ONLY; FILESYSTEM CLEAN\n24/07/11 14.42.39,214 com.apple.backupd: Disk image /Volumes/Data/Thorbjørns MBP.sparsebundle mounted at: /Volumes/Time Machine-sikkerhedskopier\n24/07/11 14.42.39,287 com.apple.backupd: Backing up to: /Volumes/Time Machine-sikkerhedskopier/Backups.backupdb\n24/07/11 14.45.02,101 com.apple.backupd: Waiting for index to be ready (100)\n24/07/11 14.45.21,588 mds: (Error) Backup: doBackupIndexFile could not stat backup location /.MobileBackups/Computer/2011-07-24-144225/Volume/Users/ravn/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History Index 2011-07-journal /.MobileBackups/Computer/2011-07-24-144225/Volume/Users/ravn/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History Index 2011-07-journal.

I erased my Time Machine and it seems to work fine now.\n\nA: From your situation, it's hard to tell if this is normal or if the process is somehow stuck.\nYou can monitor what is happening from the Time Machine system preference while the backups are taking longer than expected.\nFor more detail - fire up the Console.app and type backupd in the String Matching / filter control. You might be able to determine if the process is taking a lot of time deleting old backups or something else. You'll also see the timing and the volume of data that might help if you are having slower transfer over the network than before.\n\n\nGood luck hunting down a cause...\n[Edit - responding to additional details on the mount aborting - index failing to get ready.]\nOK - this likely won't fix itself. It's always nice to follow the recommended systematic steps to troubleshoot time machine, but I might start first with a verify pass of your existing backup files.\nTo verify, hold the option key and click your Time Machine icon in the menu bar - the verify process should get you a more concrete error you can understand or it might just fix the issue altogether. Your mac is timing out waiting for a preliminary steo to finish and it's not clear why.\n\nA: I had a similar problem: after my upgrade to Lion I get the \"Waiting for index to be ready (100)\" messages, and the complete Time Machine backup takes a LONG time (like, 45 minutes+) even for very small changes.\nBut my console/backupd logs had no error messages; the backups simply took a long time.\nBut I think I've fixed it, here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the backup disk (in Finder do Command-K to mount it if it's not already mounted).\n\n*Find the Time Machine image on the backup disk. My Mac is called \"SvecBook,\" so the Time Machine image is SvecBook.sparsebundle. Right click on the \"SvecBook.sparsebundle\" file and \"Open With\" -> DiskImageMounter.app.\n\n*Then I opened Disk Utility, clicked on the SvecBook.sparsebundle \"Time Machine Backups\" partition, the \"First Aid\" tab, then \"Repair Disk.\"\n\n*This takes a while, at least 30 minutes on my machine.\n\n*No errors were found.\n\n*If you're using a backup server, unmount the backup disk.\n\n\nThe first time I tried this the TimeMachine backups still took forever, spinning on \"Waiting for index\" for a LONG time.\nThe second time I did this TimeMachine backups worked! Now TimeMachine backups complete quickly, everything looks good!\nI have no idea what was changed or fixed by the \"Repair Disk\" process since it didn't report anything was broken. And I have no idea why this seemingly fixed the problem the second time but not the first.\nBut it works for me, for now!\nMaybe this is doing the same thing as what @bmike's \"Verify Backups\" answer did, but that didn't work for me. (Of course, my \"method\" didn't work for me the first time.)\nEdit: My Lion Time Machine backups have been working perfectly since my original answer almost 2 months ago. So I'm going to call this a good fix.\n\nA: Here's what I had to do to fix \"Waiting for index to be ready (100)\" error:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the {MyTimeMachine}.sparsebundle disk image\n\n*Delete the .Spotlight-V100 folder w/ this command:\nsudo rm -rf /Volumes/{MyTimeMachine}/.Spotlight-V100\n\n*Open Spotlight preferences, go to Privacy tab, and add the {MyTimeMachine} volume to list of excluded directories\n\n*Unmount/eject {MyTimeMachine}\n\n*Run \"Backup Now\"\n\n\nWhere {MyTimeMachine} is a variable = the name of your sparsebundle disk\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for show window.(opposite function of Command-H) If I press Command-H, an activated window disappear. How can I make it appear with shortcuts?\n\nA: There is no shortcut to bring the window back, because the app loses focus when hidden. To bring its windows back, you have to give it focus again.\nThe easiest way to do this is with the cmd+tab shortcut. Press that, then leave cmd held down. You'll see the App Switcher:\n\nFrom here, you can give focus to an app, as well as hide and show it without focusing.\nTo focus an app and show it's windows:\nOpen the app switcher, then (while still holding down cmd press tab until the darkened box is over the app you want to focus. Then, release the keys.\nTo show an app's windows without focusing:\nOpen the app switcher, then (while still holding down cmd press tab until the darkened box is over the app you want to focus. While still holding down cmd, press h Then, release the keys.\nIf you want to 'hide' one window and don't want the app to lose focus, you can minimize the window. Do that by clicking the green button at its top right, or using Window-> Mimize (cmd+m).\nTo restore a minimized window, click its name in the app's Window menu. Or, you can either click the window's icon in the right of your dock, or the app's Dock icon (depending on your settings).\n\nA: You can simply use the task switcher ( ⌘ cmd + ⇥ tab ) to bring the application back into focus and display it normally.\n", "Q: How can I reset Location Warnings in the iOS simulator on Lion? Referring to the following question here, how can I reset warnings for locations in Mac OS X Lion?\n\nA: Lion didn't change your Xcode or iPhone simulator.\nXcode 4.1 / iOS Simulator 4.3 has rolled that into the resetting the simulated device.\n", "Q: How to create a pseudo-guest account in Lion with FileVault 2? The guest account always had very limited permissions, unfortunately since activating FileVault on Lion it's deactivated by default. (More about it here: Unable to create Guest Account after enabling FileVault.)\nIs it possible to give the guest account a password? Or can I create a regular account with the normal guest account's privileges (hence making a pseudo-guest account)?\nI simply need FileVault and a limited account for my guest! :)\n\nA: Guest Account\nThis account is visible in Directory Utility, but please do not attempt to make it compatible with FileVault 2. Not only for security; there may be other good reasons for Apple making this account not available whilst FileVault 2 is enabled. \nOther accounts\nFor your guest you might like to create a standard account, or add parental controls. You can probably have an account that is password-free. This is in line with Kyle Cronin's answer to a linked question. \nRecommended reading\nApart from being able to encypt an entire volume, what are the other differences of FileVault 2 over FileVault?\n\nA: If you download the OS X server tools package, you can use the Users and Groups application to modify user's rights, even on OS X Client.\nThere are quite a few options to lock it down in various ways, depends on your exact requirements for locking it down.\nSo, I would just create a regular account and configure it to run the way you'd like.\n", "Q: Why is Git not found after installing OS X Lion? I just upgraded to OS X Lion and now cannot initialize Git where it used to work fine:\n$ git add .\n\n-bash: git: command not found\n\nI'm new to Git and to programming, so I'm sure it's a quick fix, any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks guys!\n\nA: If /usr/local/git already exists, you'll need to either add it to your $PATH or make a symlink placing the symlink inside a directory that is in your existing PATH.\nA common practice is to make /usr/local/bin if it doesn't exist and add a link:\nsudo -s\nmkdir -p /usr/local/bin\nln -s /usr/local/git/bin/git /usr/local/bin/git\nexit\n\n\nA: Lion (and Snow Leopard) didn't ship with git - so perhaps the way you installed git didn't survive the upgrade. You'll need to find your copy of git or just get a new copy. Using spotlight to search your Time Machine backups might be fruitful to find the files and know if it's a path issue or the binaries are truly gone after Lion migrated your data. \nAll of your repos stored in user space are fine. Do try to get the same or newer version of git. \nThe command line mdfind -name git will list all files that spotlight has seen with git in the name. Most installations of git should survive an upgrade to Lion and you only have to clean up your environment or link to the binary from somewhere in your $PATH.\nXcode 4(4.0-4.2) drops git into /Developer/usr/bin along with most of the other tools you need like make and gcc. It might be simplest to maintain git after getting the (currently) free Xcode from the App Store. Xcode 4.3 puts giy and other tools in Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin.\nTo avoid issues with different versions, you might want to make sure any old versions are gone from your hard drive. (and certainly from your $PATH)\n\nA: Step 1: Reinstall git (I just installed the Snow Leopard version from here) if it's not in:\n\n/usr/local\n\nStep 2: Open Terminal and do the following:\n\ncd /etc\nsudo nano bashrc\n\nThen in nano at the top of the file write (as aaron suggested)\n\nPATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH\n\nPress Ctrl+X to quit nano and press Y to save. Then exit terminal and reopen and git should be working for you.\n\nA: Possibly, you had installed git through MacPorts or Fink.\nI think it will take some time to have a release of either for Lion... or possibly you should try and reinstall it...\nIndeed, it seems that you need to install MacPorts from trunk to get Lion compatibility...\nFink has also got some hints about upgrading to Lion.\n\nA: If you have XCode installed, the best solution is Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads -> Install Command Line Tools.\nThis put git (among other things) at /usr/bin/git.\nIf you don't have Xcode installed, then installing it just for git would definitely be overkill.\n\nA: I think you will find that Git is still installed on your system.  It looks like the PATH is just messed up.  Check to see if /usr/local/git still exists on your system.\nI just added the following to my ~/.bashrc file and everything is back to normal.\nPATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH\n\nTo be more specific, this site - http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html - details the difference between .bashrc and .bash_profile. If you use Mac's terminal with Git, then adding the above PATH specification to your .bash_profile will do the job. Of course, you'll have to close the Terminal window and open a new one because the .bash_profile file is loaded on a Terminal window's opening.\nIn summary, adding this to .bash_profile would work too.\n\nA: From StackOverflow: \nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/git/bin/\n\nthen run source ~/.bash_profile in Terminal\nLink to the post there: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6810059/git-on-mac-os-x-lion/6810082#6810082\n\nA: If you are using brew, just run this command from the terminal.\nbrew install git\n\nA: This happened because git stop being part of the $PATH (for some migration reason).\nThere is a very simple way of fixing this in OS X:\nIn OS X, you can add variables to $PATH by changing the file\n/etc/paths\n\nso, you can put back git doing the following:\nsudo vim /etc/paths\n\nadd /usr/local/git/bin to the end of the file, save, and exit. Restart shell. Git should work.\n\nA: Just download the newest version from here: http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/\nInstall it, open up a new terminal, and it works like before :D\n\nA: Same issue here, downloaded and installed the snow leopard version from google code and off I went. Needed to quit and re-open terminal though...\nAll is well again..\n\nA: When there is git path already,\njust add directory to your PATH variable. \necho 'export PATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile\n\nA: I fixed it by downloading and reinstalling git from here.\n\nA: I used the App Store to install Xcode and it just gives you an all in one app blob.  However it DOES have other apps and installers in it.  I just needed git so the path from that is \nexport PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin\nIts a bit of a hack, but I don't use Xcode for a lot of stuff.  Add to your bash config as other posters described and your good to go\n\nA: You don't need to modify the path or install the Xcode command-line tools. Just use the \"xcrun\" utility from the Terminal:\nhttp://www.cocoanetics.com/2012/07/you-dont-need-the-xcode-command-line-tools/\n\nA: I solved it by following advice on this site:\nhttp://blogger.forgottenskies.com/?p=740\nIt was just a pathing issue. To be honest, I expected a whole lot more issues. The upgrades are getting smoother. I remember when I upgraded from Tiger to Leopard, just about everything \"open source\" broke..\n", "Q: Temporary files listed by lsof don't exist I like copying flash videos for offline viewing later.

More precisely, these files have a “link count” of 0, meaning that there is no directory entry (no link, i.e. no name) that leads to them, but the file data still exists. The file data will be deleted when the file is closed.\nThe ability of lsof to display files with a link count of 0 depends on the platform, and I can't find anything in the documentation regarding the situation on OS X. Try running lsof +L to see the files' link count, or lsof +L1 to list only files with a link count of 0.\nI wouldn't be surprised if the flash plugin created the file and immediately deleted in, it's a simple technique for making the data harder to obtain from outside the application. In other words, it's what the plugin author would do precisely to make it hard to do what you're trying to do. If that's what going on, you could counter it with something like libtrash for OSX.\n\nA: Have you tried putting the path in quotes? \nLike this: \n$ ls \"/private/var/folders/zz/zzTLi2haPMrCYxEbpkwFmS+++TI/-Tmp-/.com.google.chrome.p22bCa\" \n\n\nA: Try this:\ncp /proc/$pid$/fd/$fdid$\n\nWhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*$pid$ - Process id\n\n*$fdid$ - File descriptor id\n\n\nProcess ids usually are 4 digit numbers.\nFile descriptors usually have a letter next to them (r, u, w, etc.).\nTake this one for example:\nGoogle    311 mike   22u     REG       14,1      9974 17819369 /private/var/folders/z...\n\nReplace $pid$ with 311 and $fdid$ with 22 so that you get:\ncp /proc/311/fd/22\n\n", "Q: Does Lion allow locking screen on computer sleep and screen saver but not display sleep? In Leopard, you can configure it so that a password is required when waking the system from computer sleep (i.e. close the lid) or returning from the screen saver, but not display sleep. This allowed me to easily lock my screen by activating the screen saver with a hot corner or have it lock automatically after an extended period of time when the screen saver kicked in or the machine went to sleep.\nIn Snow Leopard, however, this changed to require a password even for display sleep. This is frustrating because I'd have constantly type my password. A detailed discussion of the issue is available on Apple's forum.\nI'd like to know if Lion 'fixed' this problem? Or does it behave the same as in Snow Leopard?\n\nA: Lion has \"fixed\" the problem by changing the wording of the preference, not by changing the behaviour.

I now see the volume appearing in the Disk Utility and when I click on \"Verify\" I get the following output:\nVerifying volume “Time Machine Backups”\nChecking file systemJournal need to be replayed but volume is read-only\nChecking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\nDetected a case-sensitive volume.\nChecking extents overflow file.\nUnused node is not erased (node = 3568)\nChecking catalog file.\nKeys out of order\nThe volume Time Machine Backups was found corrupt and needs to be repaired.\nError: This disk needs to be repaired. Click Repair Disk.\n\nCan I simply chmod the sparsebundle file to set the right permissions?\n\nA: Extended attributes on the sparsebundle may be preventing writes on the file:\nRun\nchflags -R nouchg flattop.sparsebundle\n\nBut be careful, the sparsebundle may have been protected because it genuinely is broken.\n\nA: It's not that simple as chmod. First, it appears that 10.5 / 10.6 / 10.7 all have minor differences in how a sparse bundle is handled. Second, the flags and dirty/bad status of a sparse bundle are stored elsewhere. Third, you may need to attack the sparse bundle itself - not the filesystem that is contained within.\nYour best bet is to let Disk Utility take a crack at repairing the image before you look at the filesystem embedded within. It works on both the bundle and the filesystems - as well as knows how Apple has stored things. \nThe details of the bundle are either proprietary or hard to discern from the developer docs - and it's certainly not something other third party utilities are keen to fix at this point. As long as you are using an equal or newer version of Disk Utility than the mac that made the backups, you should be fine. Once you've given up on Disk Utility - you might try something like Drive Genius or Disk Warrior - but I'd stick with Apple's tool if you hope to reuse this bundle.\nThe nature of sparse bundles - specifically the hard links as well as the concept that it's not compacted when files are deleted, there is a lot of work to be done. I have had DiskUtility run for two weeks and still not complete a repair pass on a 800MB sized archive.\nIn practice, you might be better off just reverting to a prior version of your NAS if it has snapshots or is backed up itself. In the end - if there are errors that fsck/Disk Utility can't fix, your sparse bundle will be marked as bad and it will be locked. You can then read things, but never write to it again. Do see if you can connect a machine to the storage and fix things (DAS or high speed connections are better - as is a machine that can have the time to fix things and not get rebooted is ideal) \nBest of luck - this may not be recoverable from the details you provided.\n\nA: I have a Synology NAS and was getting the NO-WRITE error when trying to run the fix but I came across this tweaked version that saved my bacon:\n\n*\n\n*Disable Time Machine backups so it will not interfere with the repair process: tmutil disable\n\n*Mount the SMB/AFP share containing the sparsebundle: mkdir /Volumes/TimeMachine ; mount_afp afp://ReadyNAS:<pass>@<ip-address>/ReadyNAS /Volumes/TimeMachine (alternatively, mount the share in Finder)\n\n*Reset the flags on the sparsebundle set by Time Machine that prevents it from being written: chflags -R nouchg /Volumes/TimeMachine/<my-backup>.sparsebundle\n\n*Attach the sparsebundle read-write: hdiutil attach -nomount -readwrite -noverify -noautofsck /Volumes/TimeMachine/<my-backup>.sparsebundle. You should get an output similar to:\n\n/dev/disk2              GUID_partition_scheme\n/dev/disk2s1            EFI\n/dev/disk2s2            Apple_HFS\n\n\n\n*Using the last entry of the output, run fsck: fsck_hfs -dy /dev/rdisk2s2. To speed up the repair, you can tell fsck to use more memory: -c 8g if you have 8G of free memory, etc. Optionally, run fsck_hfs -dy -Race /dv/rdisk2s2 to rebuild catalog after you run the initial repair (in my case, running the rebuild before the initial repair corrupted the filesystem beyond repair).\n\n*Then, we need to tell Time Machine that the sparsebundle is good to use.

I had to add the -readwrite option to hdiutil in order to make it work for my encrypted image. Without that option, hdiutil doesn't ask for the password.\nAt the fsck step, I encountered a Disk full error. To fix that, I used the resize option to enlarge the image size prior to running fsck. \nHere are the commands I used to fix it:\n# chflags -R nouchg MyImage.sparsebundle\n\n# hdiutil attach -nomount -noverify -readwrite -noautofsck MyImage.sparsebundle\nEnter the password to access „MyImage.sparsebundle“: \n/dev/disk2              GUID_partition_scheme           \n/dev/disk2s1            EFI                             \n/dev/disk2s2            Apple_HFS                       \n\n# hdiutil resize -size 1.5t MyImage.sparsebundle\nEnter the password to access „MyImage.sparsebundle“: \n\n# fsck_hfs -drf /dev/disk2s2\n** Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\n** Detected a case-sensitive volume.\n   The volume name is Time Machine-Backups\n** Checking extents overflow file.\n** Checking catalog file.\n** Rebuilding catalog B-tree.\n…\n\n# hdiutil detach /dev/disk2s2\n\nAs explained in the other answers, the device path may vary, so instead of disk2s2 you have to use the disk that is printed by the hdiutil attach command. Also, you only need the resize step if you did get the Disk full error when executing the fsck_hfs command. Also, instead of my 1.5t you should enter a reasonable new size that is just slightly larger than your current image size (check with du -hs MyImage.sparsebundle).\n\nA: I have a write up on how to try and repair NAS-based sparsebundle errors on my blog.  In summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*hdiutil attach -nomount -noverify -noautofsck /Volumes/{name of your disk}/{name of}.sparsebundle\nYou will then see something like\n/dev/diskx Apple_partition_scheme\n/dev/diskxs1 Apple_partition_map\n/dev/diskxs2 Apple_HFSX\n\nWhere x is the disk id for the external disk. x might be 2, 3, 4 or\nhigher. You are interested in the one labeled Apple_HFSX or Apple_HFS. \n\n*fsck_hfs -drfy /dev/diskxs2 using whatever relevant device was located in Step 1.\nHopefully, you will eventually see\n\nThe Volume was repaired successfully\n\n\n*hdiutil detach /dev/diskxs2\n\nHowever, since OS X 10.6.3, Time Machine will refuse to write to a destination volume that fails its verification.  Even if the process above succeeds in recovering the backup, you may still need to remove the black marks that Time Machine wrote when it failed verification.\n\n\n*Unlock the sparsebundle\nchflags -R nouchg /Volumes/{name of your disk}/{name of}.sparsebundle\n\n\n*Move it back to its original location\nmv /Volumes/{name of your disk}/{name of}_YYYY-MM-DD.sparsebundle /Volumes/{name of your disk}/{name of}.sparsebundle\n\n\n*At the top level directory of the sparsebundle, edit the file com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove\n<key>RecoveryBackupDeclinedDate</key>\n<date>{whatever-the-date}</date>\n\n\n*Change\n<key>VerificationState</key>\n<integer>2</integer>\n\nto\n<key>VerificationState</key>\n<integer>0</integer>\n\n\nA: I did all the steps above but after a while the image could not be repaired using fsck_hfs or hdutil, lots of errors related to threads or nodes corrupted.\nWhat worked for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*(Optional) Connect a HFS Jornaled formated external USB 1TB drive.\n\n*(Optional) In Airport Utility, go to Time Capsule Disks -> Archive Disk into the Drive connected to Time Capsule by USB. This took me 12 hours for 600 GB.\n\n*hdiutil attach -nomount -noverify -noautofsck\n    /Volumes/DISK/MyFile.sparsebundle\n\n*Then the disk was visible using\nDiskWarrior. On Directory tab, click Rebuild. It took about 1 hour.\nOnce fixed I could finally mount and backup my files.\n\n\nA: If you back up a sparse bundle disk image on one machine and try to open it on another you may get the \"no mountable filesystems\" error message, especially if the owners' usernames differ between the two machines.\nMy solution was copying the bundle to my local disk and running\nsudo chown -R MyUserName nonmounting.sparsebundle\non it.\nAfter that it opened fine and all was right with the world.\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the disk image, change \"Everyone\" to read and write.\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*chmod -R 777 {disk image path}\nIt was apparently a permissions issue.\nNOTE: THIS WILL MAKE YOUR BACKUP ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE WHO HAS PHYSICAL ACCESS TO IT\n\nA: I hope this may help someone. \nI got locked out of my legacy file vault account after an El Capitan security update with a 'no mountable filesystem' error. \nWhat worked out in my case was opening the sparsebundle file using 'show package contents' from the drop down menu and manually changing access for 'everyone' from 'no access' to 'read&write' for each of the enclosed items. For the 'bands' directory I used the 'apply to enclosed items' command from the drop down menu.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a sparsebundle hosted on a Windows machine. I tried everything in this and other threads, resulting always on a no mountable file systems error (showing a 112 error too). \nThe problem was Windows Defender, that detected one of the files in the sparsebundle as a trojan (Trojan:Script/Foretype.A!ml). Other people reported somethin similar false positives, like Spotify cache or Rust compiled files. \nTo solve the problem, just exclude the file from the Windows Defender quarantine and mount the sparsebundle again. It took too long, so you can get an output using this command:\nhdiutil attach -verbose -debug -mountpoint /mount/path /path/to.sparsebundle\n\n\nA: In my case, I replaced my hard drives in my iMac and ran an upgrade to Big Sur. After the upgrade, I couldn't access my Time Capsule Time Machine backup. I tried mounting it, but got the error:\ndiskimagemounter doesn't recognize sparsebundle\nI went through some of the steps in this post and nothing worked the same as explained.  In the comments, someone mentioned chmod to 777 or something. I figured why not try fixing the file permissions. So, I did the following:\n\n*\n\n*Navigate the drive with the TimeMachine backup on it labeled \"[whatevertheusernamewas].sparsebundle\". Right-click and select Get Info.\n\n\n*At the bottom of the resulting window, click the little lock and enter your password as prompted.\n\n\n*Click the [+] and select your user from the list (there might only be two users in the list: your user and the admin user). Click Select.\n\n\n*In the little column that says Privilege next to your username, select Read & Write.\n\n\n*Next to the [+] is a little circle with three dots in it with a dropdown arrow next to it. If the option to Apply to Enclosed Items is there, then select it. Otherwise, just close the Get Info window, and now try double-clicking the Time Machine \".sparsebundle\" file.\nIt will hopefully now mount on your Desktop. When you see all of the little drives, pick the one labeled the date you want to access.  Navigate to the files you want to recover.\n\nA: I just had the same problem\n** /dev/rdisk2s2 (NO WRITE)\n\nwhen trying to fix a currupted TM-sparsebundle on a QNAP 419II.\nI \"ejected\" the TM-mount using Finder and run\nhdiutil attach -nomount -noverify -noautofsck ...\n\ncommand (found here Fix Time Machine Sparsebundle NAS Based Backup Errors) again, which (in contrary to the first run with which it printed \"/dev/disk2s2   Apple_HFSX\") this time it gave\n/dev/disk1s2            Apple_HFSX  \n\nChecking the sys-log with\ntail -f /var/log/fsck_hfs.log\n\nNo showed\n/dev/rdisk1s2: fsck_hfs run at Sun Feb 17 17:53:20 2013\n/dev/rdisk1s2: ** /dev/rdisk1s2\n/dev/rdisk1s2:    Executing fsck_hfs (version diskdev_cmds-540.1~34).\n** Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\n** Detected a case-sensitive volume.\n...

Add this function to your ~/.bash_profile (or any other shell config file you might use):\nspot() {\n  mdfind \"kMDItemFSName=='*$@*'cd\";\n}\n\nYou can then use the spot function on the command-line:\nspot foo bar\n\nThis will search for all files and directories containing the arguments you passed to spot in their name.\nNote that cd in the above function is a modifier, making the search case-insensitive (c) and ignoring diacrtical marks (d).

Once you perform the search without having clicked on that drop-down, the drop-down will not appear even if you click again in the search bar.  You have to type another character in the search bar, then delete it, and THEN the drop down appears.\nThis is pretty stupid on Apple's part. They took something that was simple, very clear and self-explanatory, and made it hard to find, a bit difficult, less useful and inconsistent. If you want to search contents first and then switch to filenames, it's not as easy as the simple click of a visible button.  No logical reason for this. I hope they return the original, better-designed feature.\n\nA: Search using the name: selector\n\nThe Found app was awesome.

Automator can take screenshots and you need to use a shell script to upload the screenshot unless you have an FTP client which is compatible with Automator.

A 5-minute interval might be more appropriate.\nHere is an Automator workflow which I just tested successfully to take a screenshot and upload it to an ftp server.\nNB: you need to set the shell script step to ignore input from the previous step or it will fail when trying to convert the image to text.\n\nYou can save this workflow as a .workflow file and then you need to schedule it to run on whatever interval you think is appropriate.

I don't think you will gain much at all by doing a multiple threads. In fact there's potential for it to be slower, especially if you are on a hard drive, with the increased seeking. \n\nA: Limited by Storage\nCopying files is Input/Output (I/O) bound. This means the copy can only go as fast as the reading or writing of the data. Another limit will be the bandwidth within the computer's bus or the interface the data is being sent over, such as  USB, ethernet, or wireless.\nMulti-threading or using a faster processor will not significantly reduce copying times. Once the maximum I/O limits of the storage device are reached, increasing the threads or processing power will do nothing; it may even slow the copy due to the administrative overhead.\nrsync - reliably copying thousands of files\nOn macOS, a reliable tool for copying thousands of small files and folders is rsync (Remote Synchronisation). rsync is included with macOS, so there is no third party software to download and install.\nrsync has the ability to compress and decompress data on the fly and can deal with partial copies.\nSee Fastest and safest way to copy massive data from one external drive to another for a related question about how to copy massive amounts of data.\n", "Q: Where does Mac OS X store contacts in my Address Book?

After upgrading to Lion on my recently purchased Macbook Pro 13\" base model I'm having trouble connecting to an HDLCD TV.  My TV is connected to a receiver.  Sometimes when I connect I get 5.1 sound to play through my speakers.  Sometimes it's 2.1 sound. And other times no sound can be played.  Even just getting the laptop to display to the TV is hit or miss.  \nIs this a known issue?  Any suggestions on how to get things to work consistently?\nUPDATE:  It appears that connecting the laptop to the TV is not problematic if there is nothing playing at the time the connection is made.  I get anomalous results if I make a connection while playing something.\n\nA: The best chance of success (and Lion doesn't seem to affect this either way) is to have the cord connected when the TV is turned on. This lets the mac and the TV negotiate the formats that the TV supports. Sometimes hot plugging it, even though it's supposed to work causes interference (snow) or worse on the TV until you make the connection again.\n", "Q: VLC Player Problem? recently i downloaded VLCP layer for my iPad2.\ni know that VLC player can play MKV format.\nso i add MKV format movie into my ipad2 and test it.\none warning occur \"Your iPad2 is too slow to play that movie\".\ni think that iPad2's processor are dual.\nso why its happening?\nCan't i watch MKV format in my iPad2.\nif it can be please tell me how to do that.\nThanks you for your time.\n\nA: (HD-)MKVs require a lot more processing power than the iPad can offer. Bear in mind that all the decoding in VLC for iOS is done in software...iOS devices only have H.264/MP4 hardware decoding support - and VLC is not using it, even for files in said format. If you want to watch HD files on your iPad, you need to reencode them to H.264 in a MP4 container and watch them using the iOS video player.\n", "Q: Cleanup apache config for Lion Server I have installed Lion Server on my box.  (broke my existing VPN setup, and I wanted to play around with it).\nI had a bunch of stuff already setup in apache (some webdav for omnifocus, ical, etc).  Due to my customizations (I'm assuming) the server manager can't really do anything with apache (no ical, webdav, wiki, etc).  What do I need to do to reset to a place where the Lion server software is happy with the way I've got my box setup?  \n\nA: You can restore the web server to factory settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the Web Server service\n\n*Open Terminal and run sudo serveradmin command web:command=restoreFactorySettings\n\n*Enter your administrator password\n\n*Restart Web Server service.\n\n\nA: If that didn't do the trick, \n\n\n*\n\n*turn off everything which uses Apache (Wiki, iCal-Server ...)\n\n*run the following command\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ServerFoundation.framework/Resources/xswebconfig restorefactorysettings\n\nThe answer using serveradmin to reset factory defaults calls the xswebconfig and sometimes you need to force the lower level reset and consider other web based services that may lock and prevent a shutdown of the service.\n", "Q: Double entries in Launchpad (Mac OSX 10.7, Lion) I have many double entries in Launchpad. (Address Book, DVD Player, Image Capture). Any idea why and how to fix it?\n\nA: Launchpad looks for applications in at least two different locations: the Applications folder in your Home directory, and the \"root\" Applications folder sitting in \"Macintosh HD.\" If it sees an application in more than one place, it puts an icon on the Launchpad for each place it's in. (Try using Spotlight to see if you have more than one Address Book!)\nMoving the extraneous apps out of ~/Applications should put them out of Launchpad's sight (at least, as of the next reboot).\n\nA: Actually I know now what happend: There was a time when I rearranged applications to sub-folders like \"media\" ...\nEverything that has been moved so such a folder has now been newly installed in the default location...\n", "Q: Can any settings reduce or eliminate the Mac OS X Lion Jumping Cursor Bug? How do you stop the jumping cursor bug in Mac OS X Lion?\nI am using the Magic Mouse and the cursor keeps jumping to the edge of the screen very often, every minute or two I say.

I used Users & Groups' \"Login Items\" panel to do this. When I login, all of the shares pop up in their own Finder windows.\nHow can I keep the Finder windows from popping up at login? I've already tried checking the Hide checkbox.\n\nA: Here are two very simple solutions made possible by automation tools baked right in Mac OS X, AppleScript and Automator.\nAppleScript\nYou can use AppleScript to make a a very simple app that will mount your shares without opening any new Finder windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open AppleScript Editor and put in this script:  \ntell application \"Finder\"\n    mount volume \"afp://Share.local/folder\" as user name \"username\"\nend tell\n\n\n*Adapt it to your need (configure your shares).\n\n*Save it as an application.\n\n*Add it to your login items in the \"Accounts\" preference pane.\n\n\nIt may ask your password the first time, but you can save it in Keychain and won't bother you anymore.\nOf course, you can mount multiple disk by adding some additional mount volume lines.\nAutomator\nIf you prefer a visual interface, you can use Automator as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and choose \"Application\".\n\n*Add action \"Get Specified Servers\" (in the \"Files & folders\" section).\n\n*Add your shares in the list.\n\n*Add action \"Connect to Servers\" (in the same section).\n\n*Save the application.\n\n*Add it to your login items in the \"Accounts\" preference pane.\n\n\nHere's a screenshot of the process:\n\n\nA: Have you tried instead configuring your mounts using Directory Utility. I just posted a quick how to get there here.\nHow can I stop OS X from automatically connecting to an NFS server on startup?\nI authenticated as root, created a new empty record, dragged the share I wanted to mount silently to replace the dummy text of the new record and quit.\nIt figured out it was an afp share using mobile me to locate a remote mac. I certainly haven't tested this at all well in Lion - but this is the place I like to set up mounts rather than just popping them in the login items.\n\nYou might have to dig into the server documentation as setting up a directory (local or LDAP) can be a little tweaky and exact sequence and details count heavily whether it will work reliably.\n\nA: I'm about 60% sure this is the case: Finder remembers if a volume's window was open when it was ejected. Close the window then eject it, it shouldn't open automatically the next time it's mounted. I know this works for a handful of disk images I mount at login. \nUnfortunately that hide checkbox doesn't work for anything but apps. I believe that's why the instructional text specifically says \"to hide an application\". \n\nA: In Lion, any open windows will be reopened when you next login. When you restart or shutdown, you have the option to deselect the \"reopen windows when logging back in\" check box. This makes Lion restart with a \"relatively\" clean slate.\nTry deselecting that check box, and see if your problem is resolved?\n\n", "Q: OSX Lion showing a white screen plus pointer prior to the desktop appearing During boot-up, immediately after the Apple logo with the spinning progress wheel ends, rather than the desktop appear, I get a white screen with pointer in the top left for about 5 seconds.

Unfortunately, after upgrading to Lion, it's broken.\nThe point is, Lion changed behavior of pressed keys -- they don't repeat, apart from punctuation that does.\nBut I can't fix it, since Ukelele apparently uses some PPC program.\nIs there any other keyboard layout editor for Mac?\n\nA: I use KeyRemap4MacBook, it works on Lion.

Apple's advertising for Lion highlights a new \"local snapshots\" feature of Time Machine:\n\nOS X Lion lets you take the Time Machine experience with you when you’re away from your Time Capsule or backup drive. Time Machine keeps a spare copy of the files you create, modify, or delete right on your Mac. Now if you accidentally delete a file while on the road, you can recover it from a local copy.\n\nI'm wondering how this integrates with the regular Time Machine backups. Are the \"local snapshots\" copied to the external Time Machine drive the next time you connect it? And are they then deleted from the internal drive? What if you're doing dual backups with two separate external drives? ...\n\nA: I haven't found any documentation for this feature yet, so I don't have any specific answers for your questions about interactions with external Time Machine drives.\nHowever, I did do some playing around with the feature while using my laptop on battery.  The first thing I noticed is that local snapshots were not enabled by default – for me, at least. I know that because \"entering\" Time Machine while my backup drive was detached resulted in the usual error message — until I executed the following from a command line:\nsudo tmutil enablelocal\n\nAfter I did this, a hidden volume called MobileBackups was created (in /Volumes) and I was able to \"enter\" Time Machine. (Perhaps local snapshots weren't enabled on my machine because I have less than 10% free disk space?)\nUnfortunately, the feature seems a little half-baked. I tried the following, with pretty unsatisfactory results:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a new folder, ~/Documents/Test.\n\n*Forced a new snapshot by running tmutil snapshot.\n\n*Verified that a new snapshot was created by looking in /Volumes/MobileBackups/Backups.backupdb/hostname/Latests/drivename/Users/myname/Documents.\n\n*Deleted the Test folder.\n\n*Entered Time Machine and browsed the backups/snapshots. The Test folder was not there in any of the backups.\n\n\nUpdate: I installed Lion on a second Mac, and without any explicit action on my part, this Mac has a MobileBackups volume. And restoring deleted files from a local snapshot works on this Mac.\n", "Q: Install Mac OS X Lion from newly installed SDD in Mac Book Pro A1260 (2008 model) I have an old Mac Book Pro A1260 (2008 early model), and I need to replace the old HDD with SDD.

When exploring the new Launchpad feature, at first, it would seem as is it draws it's content primarily from the Programs folder.\nIt seems to be the case, however, that the Launchpad database is drawn from somewhere else. \nFor example, when installing a game through Steam, the game itself will not show up in the Programs folder, but will show up in Launchpad. In this particular case, I want it to be in Launchpad. The drawbacks, however, are that I am unable to remove the game from Launchpad and am unable to change the icon.\nWhere can I directly view and modify every Launchpad occurrence?\n\nA: Apologies for tacking this on to a 2-year old thread, but FWIW the value for some-hex-name is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.dock.*another-hex-name*.plist as LaunchPadDBName.\nIt seems like the number itself is not important, and may in fact be random; but, it may probably needs to conform to the UUID format.  Changing this value for a user, then logging in, will result in a new .db being created if it does not already exist.\nYou can use this to set multiple accounts to use a pre-defined LaunchPad configuration, etc.\n\"another-hex-name\" is the UUID of the computer\n\nA simpler way to access this value is to use:\ndefaults -currentHost read com.apple.dock LaunchPadDBName\n\nThis makes use of the -currentHost argument of the defaults command:\nHost  Optionally you can restrict changes to a specific host\n      by default changes will apply to any host.\n      [-host hostname]  Restrict to a remote machine.\n      [-currentHost]    Restrict to the host the user is currently logged into.\n\n\nA: The Launchpad database is located at ~/Library/Application Support/Dock/*some-hex-name*.db\nTo edit it, you'll have to use SQLite. You can do this on the command line, or with a graphic interface.\nSee this Ask Different question for recommendations for a GUI app.\n\nMacOS Sierra and newer\nOn macOS Sierra and newer the old launchpad database does not exists anymore. Instead every user has his personal launchpad database somewhere inside /private/var/folders.\nHow to find the database\nThe /private/var/folders directory contains lots of cryptic folder names, but you can identify the path to your user's personal folder using getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR. You may note this command returns a path inside /var/folders instead of /private/var/folders, but /var is a symlink to /private/var.\nThe following one-line command will return the path to the database:\n echo /private$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db\n\nAfter you have the path to the new database, you can continue to edit it like before (e.g. using sqlite3 command).\nThanks to Chris Perry from Jamf Nation for sharing what he found!

I can see that I will quickly come to love the Lion way of scrolling.\nMy brain will soon become rewired to think of moving the content with my gestures instead of moving the controller down to slide content up in my fixed viewport.\nI have several macs that need to remain on Snow Leopard for some time, and would love any suggestions on how I might change them to better fit Lion's new model for scrolling.\n\nA: This post by John Gruber outlines several possibilities:\nFor OSX:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scrollvetica\n\n*Scroll Reverser\nFor Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*An AutoHotkey hack\nOn the Mac side, Scroll Reverser looks nice in the menu bar, is free, and works from Tiger to Snow Leopard (10.4 - 10.6).\n\n", "Q: Help me un-clutter the first page of apps on Launchpad I have grown very fond of a sparse first page of apps on iOS and want to hack, reverse-engineer, and/or fake out Launchpad to get a clean first page of apps.\nHere is a picture from iOS that is analagous to what I want to accomplish:\n\nI don't need a text overlay at the top (bars, ATT, time, etc...) or the row of icons at the bottom - I just want space on the first screen, followed by subsequent pages that can be totally full (or ideally also have flexible space). I don't need precise control such as a gap between say pages and numbers, but that would be really neat to emulate a layout exactly as pictured (three apps at the top, four at the bottom).\nIf it's not possible to hack in a true  into the Launchpad database, can anyone show how to make \"dummy invisible apps\" that I could one by one drag to displace the apps I don't want on page one?\n\nA: To summarize...\nAs in iOS, you can organize your Launchpad icons as you please using drag-and-drop. You can reorder apps, move them from one page to another, and even put them in iOS-like folders. Note that Launchpad folders are entirely independent from the /Applications hierarchy: creating a folder in Launchpad won't create a folder in /Applications, for example.\nYour problem seems to be related to the fact that you've got so many apps. Again like iOS, there seems to be a maximum on the number of pages of apps Launchpad can handle. If you really need all 400+ apps on your Launchpad, there's not much you can do other than reorganize everything into folders to free up some slots. But I doubt you need instant access to everything Adobe has ever installed on your computer, so you have a few more options to clean out your Launchpad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete apps entirely. There's probably a few apps on your computer that are just sitting there, never to be used; you can free up space on your Launchpad and on your hard drive by getting rid of them. \n\n\n*\n\n*Apps from the App Store can be uninstalled directly from Launchpad by holding option/alt and clicking on the black X over the app's icon.\n\n*Any app can be deleted by dragging it from the Finder to the Trash.\n\n*Alternately, you can use something like AppZapper to delete an app along with any hidden auxiliary files.\n\n\n*Move apps out of Launchpad's sight. Launchpad looks for apps in /Applications, /Developer, and ~/Applications. If you like those folders to be as pristine as your Launchpad, you can move your extraneous applications to a different folder. Launchpad will lose track of them as of the next reboot.\n\n*Just remove the Launchpad icons. Finally, Andreas Ganske has developed a preference pane which modifies the Launchpad database to show or hide whatever applications you want. \n\n\nIf you just want a clean Launchpad, option three is probably your best and easiest answer. Options one and two are there if you like to keep your /Applications folder clean, too: useless apps might as well be deleted, and your CS4 uninstallers could probably be moved somewhere a little more out of the way until you need them.\nFinally, you hint at having problems with having Launchpad duplicates. As I mentioned in an answer to this question, this may be a problem of actually having more than one copy of the same app installed.\nHope this helps clear up some of your upgrade troubles!\n\nA: Folders are a first step - if you find you can't rename a folder, see this tip.\nHere's my first pass at taming the launchpad - I still don't know what I want in the dock versus the Launchpad yet - but two pages with room for apps to download to the second page from the store is much nicer.\n\nI wasn't at all aware folders were possible and will go back and clean up the first 10 pages of apps to see if I can maintain some space as desired. \nIf you want to start over, you can move your ~/Library/Applicaion\\ Support/Dock/*.db files to the trash and restart the Dock - it will make a clean list of the current Apps in Launchpad the next time it starts.\nIt's more labor intensive that I had hoped since Launchpad doesn't respect shift+click or option+click to select multiple apps for moving to another screen or \"folder\"-ing. Working one by one with over 400 items was daunting and I perhaps gave up too soon in trying to tame Launchpad.\nI was quite overwhelmed the first few times attempting to use it.\n", "Q: Will i benefit from important features of Lion with a trackpad/MacBook? I am an avid iMac user and have no intention of buying a MacBook/MacBook Air or a trackpad.\nI have just installed Lion and have seen Launchpad and Mission Control in my Dock. I could see myself using these lots, but I am concerned that it's not going to be quite as natural as finger-gestures. Will I have to learn keyboard shortcuts or is there something I'm missing?\nWill I gain the full Lion experience without a MacBook or a trackpad?\n\nA: These answers are going to vary from person to person. Additionally, I have a Magic Mouse, which only supports a subset of the total gestures.\nI think the the \"Natural\" scrolling really make sense on a touch-sensitive controller like the Magic Mouse or the Trackpad.\nThe two gestures that I've found most useful are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move backwards and forwards in Safari. I know this technically existed before Lion, but as I've previously said, the feedback of the animation makes it far more useful.\n\n*Two-finger swiping between spaces is wonderfully fluid.\n\n\nOn the contrary the two-finger double tap for Mission Control has been used a handful of times. I'm finding the ctrl + up far more useful, plus ctrl + down gets you to Exposé.\nI think there are plenty of things to like about Lion without any gesture support. I can certainly recommend the Magic Mouse, something I would've hesitated to do before Lion.\n\nA: Another way to address your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*If this is the Mac you're using to make your living, then DEFINITELY run don't walk and get a touch input now.  Recommend Magic Trackpad if it's a desktop, but not a strong opinion there.\n\n*If you're in college, just in your first job, or in a financial situation where someone bought your Mac for you and the $60-70 for a touch input is pricey - I definitely think you can get by without one without feeling like a 2nd class citizen.\n\n*Same answer if you're planning to upgrade soon to another Mac that'll come with one and don't want to pay for one twice.\n\n*Otherwise, if you're using this Mac several times (or several hours) a day, I'd say get a touch-based input sooner than later.\n\n*If you're only using it occasionally and you're asking because spending another $70 (on a computer you thought important enough to invest $1000+ in, mind you), then I'd wait until you can try it out on someone else's computer.\nFinally, if you are considering getting one and $20-30 will make a substantial difference in your decision calculus... keep an eye on discount sites, including Apple clearance online.\nEvery few months they typically offer discounted refurb devices that are easily as good as buying new.\n\nA: No, you won't gain the full experience of using Lion because you simply won't be able to do all of the gesture controls. \nOf course, gestures are just one part of over 250+ features of Lion, so although you'll be missing something, there is still plenty to enjoy. \nI do recommend trying a Magic Trackpad though. After using it for a week or so, if you switch back to a Magic Mouse you'll feel like a person with no hands.\n\nA: Yes - I definitely think you can and will benefit from Lion without a touch input device.\nMission Control is entirely controlled by the keyboard and (non-touch) mouse - there's just a gesture to trigger it.\nLaunchpad - I really would't recommend anyone consider Launchpad at all when considering an upgrade to Lion.  Compared to what's available today, it demos well, but doesn't really improve day-to-day experience enough to focus on this.\nIn my opinion, the most valuable features of Lion are not the gesture control, but what I dub ARV, i.e. the trinity of the Auto Save, Resume, Versions features.  My guess is they haven't gotten much traction in the press because they don't demo as sexily as the counterparts you're mentioning (which are great, sure).\nBut the ability to just quit an application with a document you haven't even saved yet is ridiculously useful in everyday life when your desktop, task switching bar or memory are getting overburdened.\nWhen you reboot your first time – without saving a thing – and all the applications, documents and windows you had open all return exactly where you left them... it's nearly a religious experience!  :)\nAnd Versions brings to regular users the best parts of a powerful (but heretofore complicated) tool called \"version control\" that software engineers have kept to themselves for over a decade.  If you've ever sent (or received) an attachment via e-mail with multiple recipients asking \"Please review and make changes and send back to me\", then you're going wonder where this was all your life.  Combined with Auto-Save creating micro-versions of your file (every time you launch, quit - or even pause typing!) - you can easily go back through the entire history of your document to find old parts you deleted by accident.\nIn my opinion, this is a far more important OS release than since I first got on the Mac in 2005.\nContext: been using Lion since launch day, and I'm an advanced user, but my day job is designing web sites and apps for common, timid users with basic needs.\n\nA: You won't be truly \"missing\" anything as Lion was designed in way so that all actions triggered by gestures can be invoked via other means. Some of them will be exclusive to keyboard shortcuts and/or will be located in the menu bar if you lack a trackpad. However the real popular, useful ones like Mission Control, Launchpad etc. will be accessible from your dock.\nLion has many more benefits to it in addition to the improved gestures. I'll leave it to others to go into those details.\nOn the trackpad:\nIf you have ever found yourself wishing your mouse had more buttons, then you may like the trackpad. There are even some apps like JiTouch that can extend and customize the capabilities and functionalities of the gestures while adding many more new gestures as well. It is likely it will feel uncomfortable at first, but that's normal. If you give it a shot, give it some time before you decide against it (a few days to a week is probably sufficient). I'd also recommend a wrist-pad of some sort.\n\nA: Get a Magic Trackpad or Magic Mouse (I have the latter) you're missing out , especially if you use spaces a lot. For launchpad & mission control I haven't gotten used to the gestures yet so I use hotcorners.\nPS If you want even more functionality with Macic Mouse/TrackPad look into MagicPrefs, it works with Lion (If it doesn't work right away reboot)\n", "Q: Is there an AppleScript or Automator action to quickly edit Info for Video in iTunes? I ripped the DVD set of a television series to my iMac. But now, the filenames are weird and there is no meta info. \nIn Automator, I see there is an action to edit Info for a song. That's great, but it doesn't really work for TV Shows - it won't handle the stuff that you'd see in the \"Video\" tab when viewing Info in iTunes.\nIs there an Automator action for this that I can use? If not, AppleScript?\n\nA: It's possible on iTunes, here's a example\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    repeat with i in (get selection)\n        tell i\n            set episode number to 1\n            set episode ID to \"blah\"\n            set season number to 1\n            set show to \"blah\"\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: If your files are MP4s, you can use MetaX for this.\n", "Q: Why isn't iPhoto '11 showing an event present in the library? I'm having a problem where the last imported photos to my iPhoto '11 (version 9.1.5 (615)) library don't show up under the \"Events\" entry. The event shows up under \"Last import\" and under \"Photos\", but not under \"Events\". I have tried to re-create the event several times, without luck. There are several events created from the last two photo imports that aren't showing under \"Events\".\nWhat can I do to fix this problem? Is there a way to reset iPhoto's \"Event\" index somehow so it can be rebuilt?\n\nA: Seems like the problem only was that I had managed to sort the events \"manually\" (View > Sort Events > Manually) which hid the newly created events in-between my rather large amount of existing events. Sorting by date (View > Sort Events > By Date + Descending) shows my new events first in the list as they should.\n", "Q: What are the advantages of the mac mini's hdmi output? I have a late 2008 MacBook so I know that if I want to connect my laptop to a tv I need two cables: one for video and one for audio (while in newer models this issue is bypassable via appropriate adapters). So using the hdmi port of the mini would make my life easier. \nAre there any other advantages?\nFor example when I first connected my laptop I needed to do some fiddling around with the displays settings to achieve a decent output: would that be necessary with the mini as well?\nI've been using laptops for so long I forgot what it's like not having a display already embedded in your computer!\n\nA: If you keep your machine plugged into one display, there won't be much of any 'fiddling'. And even if you switch, 10.7 actually is supposed to help with switching displays (as in, if you go from a LCD monitor to a TV). \nAnother advantage is that the machine was just updated, so depending on how much you are willing to pay, you are going to get a more powerful machine than what you have now. \nAs you said, you will also have HDMI out, which will contain audio as well. \nFinally, you will need to purchase a display, mouse, and keyboard if you don't already have one. \n\nA: In quality terms, HDMI is identical to DVI, but some TVs see DVI as a \"computer input\" and HDMI as a \"media input\", and may give you slightly different options. I'd have a quick search online to see if anyone's used your model TV with a Mac Mini, just to make sure.\nBy the way, unless you're running it a great distance, there's no advantage whatsoever to an expensive HDMI cable. The cheapest one you can buy is as good as any other!\n\nA: The unified audio and video through the cable is a nice feature, but it should be noted that because the video is DVI which is digital (unlike VGA which is analogue) all size/shape/orientation settings are automatic and there will be no \"fiddling\"\n", "Q: Can I use a Mac os x 10.6.6 that came with a newer iMac to install it on another one? I recently purchased a brand new 27\" iMac that came with snow leopard as the default os. I was wondering if I could use the back up disc that it came with to install it on my old 21\" iMac that is 5 years old. I have seen on various forums that the discs that come with computers are machine specific, and thus the result is a message stating that \"Mac OS X Snow Leopard cannot be installed on this computer.\" But I've heard there are workarounds to this. Does any one know what they are? Thanks.\n\nA: If you have the gray installation CD you probably won't be able to do it because they are machine specific, but its worth a try. If you boot from the CD & it is not compatible with the machine it will just tell you to press the power button to turn off your machine. Then just boot normally & eject the CD, no harm done.\n", "Q: Unidentifiable error while installing xcode on Lion 10.7 So two weeks ago I had purchased the 10.6 xcode from the app store.

I know that you can enable or disable the visibility of file extensions in Finder but I'm interested in avoiding .app file extensions from showing up. I hate the redundancy of seeing that the files in my Applications folder are Applications.\n\n\nA: The \"Show all filename extensions\" option overrides the \"Hide extension\" option in Get Info. This means that there are a few possible solutions one could try to find in order to hide \".app\" extensions while showing the rest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a way to exclude certain extensions from \"Show all filename extensions\".\n\n*Find a way to hide extensions, other than the \"Hide extension\" option, that it is not affected by the \"Show all filename extensions\" option.\n\n*Find a way to override the \"Hide extension\" option, other than the \"Show all filename extensions\" option, that can be configured to include or exclude items based on their extensions, or perhaps even by their location (e.g. exclude the Applications folder).\n\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, none of these are possible, but I would be happy to be proven wrong about that.\nPossible Workaround\nThe easiest workaround I can think of is to leave \"Show all filename extensions\" unchecked and to manually set other files to explicitly show their extensions, which can be done very easily with Automator and the SetFile command. \nYou can set this up as either a service or an application. In both cases, it can be used on both files and folders, and will also process the contents of subfolders.\nTo set this up in Automator, add a \"Run Shell Script\" action, set \"Pass input\" to \"as arguments\" and set the script to this:\n(Note: You have to install Xcode to get the SetFile command.)\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    find \"$f\" -name \"*.*\" -exec SetFile -a e {} \\;\ndone\n\nIf you set this up as a service, be sure to change \"Service receives selected\" to \"files or folders\".\nYou could also look into using this as a folder action. As files are added to a folder, the script will automatically set their extensions to be shown. For example, it could be useful to attach such a folder action to Downloads, Documents and the Desktop, or any other folder which frequently receives files with \"Hide extension\" checked.\nHopefully, setting this up as a service would make it so trivial to use that you wouldn't even need to worry about batch-processing an entire volume (which could take awhile). Rather, you could simply use it as needed whenever you come across files or folders of files with hidden extensions.\n\nA: This AppleScript will hide the extension of apps (everything with a \".app\" extension) directly in the Applications folder (however, it doesn't work on apps in subfolders).\nI made this a Community Wiki answer so if anyone can edit this script to improve it, please do so!\n tell application \"Finder\" to set files_ to every item in (path to applications folder) whose name ends with \"app\"\n repeat with file_ in files_\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        try\n            set extension hidden of file_ to true\n        on error e\n            display dialog e buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n        end try\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\n\nA: Of course there is a way and quite an easy one. Once you docked Applications folder drag it away (remove it) from the dock completely. Then re-ad it and it's done, all .app extensions will be gone.\n\nA: Go into finder.\nclick on preferences.\ngo to the advanced tab.\nuncheck show all filename extension.\nrestart--\n\nA: Right Click (ctrl-click) on the application & click get info, then tick the Hide Extension check box.\nPS You can open multiple get info panes by selecting multiple applications & right clicking on get info\n", "Q: Are all Snow Leopard apps resume-enabled when run in Lion? I see this in iWork 08, is it the case for everything else?\n\nA: Yes, safari restores tabs/windows, Preview.app does the same with last viewed documents, Xcode 4.1 does that too.\nI think all Apple apps support resume. Not sure what should be done for 3rd party applications to support this.\n\nA: It all depends on how each app is developed. It's a safe bet that Apple would implement this feature on most of the apps included in OS X as well as the iWork and iLife apps. \nI would argue that another question just as important is which third-party apps have this feature. Not every third-party app that runs on Snow Leopard has Resume automatically when executed in Lion. This is a case-by-case situation, on which third-party app developers have to modify how their apps handle individual documents. Sometimes they have to make minor modifications, sometimes it may involve more complicated changes. \nThe same goes for all the other major document management features in Lion (such as Versions).\nHope this helps. \n\nA: All Cocoa apps (native Objective C apps for the Intel Architecture) support Resume\n", "Q: Support for Windows Live Messenger protocol in iChat I Love iChat and its sleek UI and prefer it to Adium or Windows Live Messenger for Mac. iChat now has \".impreferencepane\" which allows the addition of support for new networks.

I have a Mac Pro, and I've added an Intel 80GB SSD to improve performance in LightRoom and Photoshop. So far so good.\nBut after moving all of my current work, catalogs, etc. to the SSD, I still have a good 65GB free currently.\nHow can I creatively use this new SSD drive for performance? I don't want to boot from this drive, but I do want to make good use of the investment.\nIdeas I've already looked into and abandoned:\n\n\n*\n\n*Moving the swap file. Looks like a pain in the butt, and opinions vary on how much this would shorten the lifespan of this older-generation SSD.\n\n*Moving Spotlight indexes. Apparently OS X forces you to index to the same volume that stores the data.\n\n*Moving Google Chrome's cache. Can't seem to find good instructions for this.\nAny ideas? I have a hammer, need more nails...\n\nA: If your main goal is to improve the performance of Photoshop and Lightroom I would focus on these specific applications. Put Photoshop files and the Lightroom lib, Photoshop and Lightroom swap/temp/history files and the Photoshop & Lightroom apps themselves on the SSD.\nMoving the system swap file to the SSD will only help if memory used by Photoshop or Lightroom is overflowed to the swap file. But if this is the case extra RAM would improve their performance a lot more.\nMoving anything else then the files directly used by Photoshop & Lightroom might result in a faster overall system, but will likely only marginally help improve the Photoshop & Lightroom experience.\n\nA: Why not run fs_usage for a while on your mac - you can filter out all the fast IO operations and start to get a feel for which files are coming back slow.\nYou might find some things you can move - so rather than guessing what might be fast, take some measurements and then only move things that in reality are slow for your specific system?\n\nA: HFS+ journal on a different volume\nA feature originally intended for Server, but possible with non-Server versions of the operating system. Mac OS X Server v10.6: Moving an HFS+ Journal to a different volume discusses using a partition of (for example) an SSD for the journal for some other volume. \n\n… Journaled HFS+ file systems can benefit from placing the journal on either a separate disk, or on a smaller, faster device. …\n\nApple's published diskutil(8) Mac OS X Manual Page is not yet updated for 10.7 so if you use Lion, pay attention to the local man page — the section for the moveJournal verb is different. \nWhichever manual you follow: if you move a journal, proceed with caution! If the command is not well constructed, the effect can be unexpectedly destructive (I have made such mistakes). \nI have not experimented enough to estimate whether moving the journal for a JHFS+ volume could be beneficial to opening poster richardtallent. \nExternal journal on the same physical disk\nFor some time I had the Apple_Journal type partition for a Core Storage-encrypted Time Machine backup volume on the same disk as that backup volume. After accidentally disconnecting the FireWire cable I had a devil of a job repairing volume structures (details of which are off-topic). I don't know whether having the external journal on the same physical disk was contributory to that devilishness. \nIf considering an external journal, it may be saner to have the journal on a separate physical disk/device. \nJournal for the startup volume\nWhilst the manual pages do not explicitly warn against using an external journal for a startup volume, results from my early experiments suggest that doing so may be not a sane move. \n\nA: Maybe this post http://blog.alutam.com/2012/04/01/optimizing-macos-x-lion-for-ssd/ will help you, Use RAM disk or HDD for temporary files\n", "Q: Does Apple have an email address, or must one call or mail them?

Lion's improved Quick Look can now preview web pages. The full screen view and quick launching make it superb for peeking at a web page without having to launch a browser; which, in my case, always has many tabs to open from a previous session that I plan to revisit later.\nI use an app called Choosy that will let me choose which browser to use when I click on a link [outside the browser]. This alleviates the concern that Quick Look isn't suitable as a permanent replacement. I would like to use Quick Look as a choice of browsers, but I've since discovered that Quick Look isn't an application.\nCan an app be made that will workaround this road bump? An app that just opens items in Quick Look that simply functions as a way to choose it as an opener or as a choice in Choosy. My main concern is that I want to be able to open a URL in the Twitter app and have it open in Quick Look. I have been spoiled by Twitter for iOS in this regard. Also, it would also be nice to use it as the default opener for images as well.\n\nA: I've written an AppleScript wrapper for qlmanage called \"Have A Quick Look\":\nhttp://dougscripts.com/471\nHowever, in Lion, the qlmanage app opens and causes some conflicts with iTunes. Oh well.\n\nA: I was able to create an application using Automator to open files in Quick Look. I used the \"View With Quick Look\" action found at this website and it works without issue for local files - right click, tell it to open using the app, and presto! Opens in Quick Look.\nHowever - I am not sure of a way to pass this action a URL. The description states that it only takes files/folders as inputs, and to be sure, I'm not familiar with how to get Quick Look to work on something that isn't part of the filesystem.\nI was thinking that perhaps you could download a copy of the page and Quick Look that, but at that point you could just open it up in the browser.\n\nA: This URL-previewing functionality does not appear to be based on Quick Look, rather it's a Data Detector. As such, there's unfortunately no programmatic way to activate it.\nHowever, you could make a simple app which previews a page in a web view, rather than trying to use the existing system.\n\nA: It does not seem to be an app. Rather, it is a framework: /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickLook.framework/. Check out the qlmanage command, and notice that /usr/bin/qlmanage is a symbolic link pointing inside the framework.\nIt might be possible to create some applescript that runs qlmanage. Then you could save the script as an application (from Applescript Editor) and use that as your file opener.\n\nA: Do you want it to work similar to Quick Look in Mail for URL's included in emails? If you investigate how OSX mail works you should find an answer. I have looked for a framework that will allow me to do this for some time now, I there will probably be something that can help you in the OSX developers site, there is a lot of sample code that apple provides, this code might include an example of how to use the Quick Look framework, but there are 372 examples to sort though. Here is the developers page for the Quick look framwork \n\nA: YES! And I just installed it; it's a chrome extension called\nURL RENDER\n(available in the google repository of extensions)\nI don't know if it'll be short-lived and find a way to annoy me, but for now..?

The help file continues to insist that there is a \"Save As\" feature in the File menu.\n\nA: In the File menu below Save... or Save a Version you have an option called Duplicate.\nThis opens a new window with the current state of the file you're editing and you can now use File > Save... to save it with different file name.\n\nA: The \"Save As\" feature has been replaced by Lion's new Versions feature. \nYou have to perform more steps now though, because first you need to Duplicate the document \n\na new version will \"jump\" out of the current document.\nYou'll notice that Save in the File menu is now changed to Save...\n\nI'm pretty sure that \"Save as\" will return shortly as this doesn't exactly make the process any easier...\n", "Q: Is there a way to suppress badge counts and the dock icon bounce for Terminal.app in Lion? With the new state saving features (which I want to keep), the dock notifications are more aggrivating to me in Lion. Can I suppress the bounce and/or the notification badge functions?\nWhile I like the new restore feature in Terminal.app that re-opens the tabs and shows the last 500 or so lines in the history, I absolutely hate that the Terminal.app now is so much more communicative and intrusive as before. \nIf I have a command like tailing a log file in the terminal, it constantly keeps telling me when there are new entries, which turns out to be pretty annoying.\nNot only does the Terminal.app's icon jump in the Dock, it also has this nice little red badge telling me how many tabs have updates for me. Fortunately this only happens when the Terminal.app's window is hidden behind others, but nevertheless it's pretty annoying. \n\nI looked through the Settings and can't find an option to disable this. Are there any hidden settings I could switch on/off there?\n\nA: Google finds an example of what is, I think, disabling bounces for all Dock icons (not Terminal alone): \n\n\n*\n\n*Annoying infinite bounces of an icon on alert!!!\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool TRUE\nHowever, that may be not the solution in this case.

Other than that it works absolutely fine. I am however a part time developer and so I really need to make sure I have a machine that runs Lion for testing as a minimum. \nLooking at new Mac minis they seem ideal to solve this problem being relatively low priced and able to do a few other things I'd find useful. My question is if I just get a new mac mini, could I somehow use the existing iMac as a monitor for it by using for instance screen sharing software. If I do then what will the performance of the screen be, I'd only really like to look  at this if the screen sharing looks the same as if I had connected a monitor directly to the mac mini. \n\nA: You could use the iMac to remotely connect to the mac mini over the network with apples remote desktop software. If you have a gigabit wired network between them then performance would probably be good enough to be usable for most tasks except 3d gaming or hd video I'd say. You cannot directly attach the iMac as an external display using a video cable however. Also, remote desktop access over wifi would probably not be ideal for everyday use\nTo actually perform this, just do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, click the 'Go' menu option and then 'Connect to Server'\n\n*type in vnc://mac-name.local:5900/ or vnc://mac-ip-address:5900/\nThis will connect the two computers and you sign in with the credentials of the account on the remote Mac\n\nA: Screen Recycler is a utility that handles this transparently. Under the hood it uses a VNC connection.\n", "Q: Can I edit the “Release Date” field of podcasts in iTunes? My workaround for iTunes automatically assigning hollow star ratings to new podcast episodes has an unfortunate side-effect: after dragging the podcast files back into iTunes, they not longer have their “Release Date” field populated, meaning they can’t be sorted in release date order. (Which gives my tiny little mind the heebie-jeebies.)\nI can figure out what the release date was for these podcasts, but iTunes won’t let me amend this field via the UI.\nIs there any way I can edit the value of this field?\n\nA: Best I can tell, the answer is a resounding “no” — at least without deleting your iTunes Library .itl file.\n\nA: There's an application called ID3 Editor that will allow you to restore the release data info for podcast files.\n", "Q: Error when downloading Window support software under Boot Camp Currently, I have already upgraded to Mac OS X Lion.\nBut an error occurred(Progress to the last 99%) that when I trying to downloading Windows support software via Boot Camp 4.0.\nIt says \"Can't install Windows Support Software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server\".\nHow can I do ? thanks\n\nA: I had that exact same problem.

Ran file on it and it reported it as an xar archive, so I ran xar -t on it to discover it is the Lion installer I downloaded from the App Store.\nJust wondering if anyone else sees this and if it's safe to delete the file?\n\nA: I had the same situation. I figure since the OS is installed and working fine, and /lost+found isn’t where it would look for anything anyway, it’s safe to delete that file. Fair warning, that’s an answer based on reasoning, not any official information.\nFor background on lost+found, I’d suggest reading \"What is the purpose of the lost+found folder?\" on Unix & Linux SE, rather than the TechRadar article linked in another answer on this question. The TechRadar article wanders, slowly, through several tangentially related topics, whereas the SE answer cuts straight to the point, has technical detail, and has a high vote count from the community.\n\nA: Just realized you said /lost+found, not trash. I found this article regarding lost and found folder. Maybe you had a system issue in the past, and some files were saved there to help recover. Check out the article. Very interesting. \n", "Q: How can I get mail.app to go to the item below a deleted item in my inbox? When I'm reviewing mail, I like to have my most recent on top, and I work backwards in time (i.e., down the list). \nBut when I delete an item, rather than going to the next lower item in the list (like Outlook does), it goes to the closest item that's newer.    Because it's based on always going to the closest item that's newer, I can't even get the desired behavior in going from new to old by reversing my sort order.\nAm I missing a preference somewhere, or do I really have to either hit the down arrow after each delete, or work from oldest to newest if I want to save those precious keystrokes?\n\nA: This behavior can be changed via a hidden preference. Open up the Terminal app and type this:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail IgnoreSortOrderWhenSelectingAfterDelete 1\nThen, restart Mail.app.\n", "Q: Setup proxy in Mac OS X Lion Installer I have \"restored\" one usb stick with the BaseSystem.dmg of the InstallESD.dmg of my Lion installation and it boots. However it wants to connect to the internet to check the system requirements blablabla.

This fixes Launchpad for editing without having to reboot or log out and back in.\nThe big red quit button works the same as killall Dock if you find Dock in the Activity Monitor.\n\nI'm assuming this is a bug, but wanted to document it in case others have the same issue or if it will just happen from time to time. It's more broken than fixed on my mac and I find myself needing to kill the Dock routinely before I can edit things after switching users.\n", "Q: Non-modal dialog in full-screen Mail.app When used in full-screen mode, Lion’s new Mail.app has a modal (= always in foreground, disables rest of application) dialog for composing and viewing messages.\nCan I disable this? It’s quite annoying since I often need to make reference to previous messages in a conversation so I need to go to and fro different messages while composing a new message.\nThe full-screen mode itself is quite handy so I’d be sorry to ditch it just to have non-modal dialogs. Other applications (I’ve tried Pages.app) don’t behave that way …\n\nA: You can use AppleScript to create a new message in a new, non-modal window, however, the window will be placed in one of your Desktop spaces, not in Mail's fullscreen space. You can save each of these as an application and access them through the Dock or the Script menu in the menu bar (enabled in AppleScript Editor's prefs).\nNew Message\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true}\n    activate\nend tell\n\nReply to Sender\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set theMessage to item 1 of (selection as list)\nreply theMessage with opening window\n    activate\nend tell\n\nReply to All\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set theMessage to item 1 of (selection as list)\n    reply theMessage with opening window and reply to all\n    activate\nend tell\n\nIf you need to have the message viewer showing behind your message (e.g. to be able to copy something from an open email), then you can add the following lines to these scripts, immediately after the tell application \"Mail\" line:\nset theMessage to selected messages of message viewer 1\nset theMailBox to selected mailboxes of message viewer 1\nset newViewer to make new message viewer\nset selected mailboxes of newViewer to theMailBox\nset selected messages of newViewer to theMessage\ndelay 1\n\nThis will create a new non-fullscreen mail viewer window, leaving the fullscreen window where it is. Then, after you send your message, you can simply close this new viewer. \nNote: Depending on how quickly the new viewer opens, you may need to adjust the delay number. This delay (in seconds) allows the new viewer window enough time to finish opening before the script continues. If your machine is fast enough, you may be able to delete that line altogether.\n\nA: I'm afraid Apple made a design choice to not allow non-modal dialogs in full-screen Mail.  I believe their reasoning for this is that you would not be able to access these dialogs if you switched back to full-screen Mail, as the Mail UI would be on top of them.\n\nA: One slightly hacky way I have found is to create a small HTML file on your desktop which contains something like\n<a href=\"mailto:test@test.com\">Send email</a>\n\nAnd it will create a non-modal email dialog with full screen Mail running in the background.  I'm sure that can be wrapped in something much more user friendly. \n\nA: I sometimes need to open some messages (more than one) in a non-modal window, and loking for the applescripts in joelseph answer, I manage to get this:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n repeat with currentMessage in (selection as list)\n      open currentMessage\n end repeat\nend tell\n\n", "Q: No more Xcode 4 for Snow Leopard? I'm trying to download Xcode 4.0 for my Mac and they want me to upgrade to Lion and download 4.1. Is there a way to download 4.0 without having to change my entire operating system?\n\nA: The App Store only distributes one version of each app. Xcode 4.0 is no longer available as Xcode 4.1 replaced it.\nIf the author of the software wishes to keep an older version on the store, the new version has to be uploaded as a different sellable item.\nIn this case, Apple didn't choose to leave both.\nYou can get multiple versions of Xcode by joining the paid developer programs. Last time I checked, Xcode 3 was available with the free account. It runs on Snow Leopard - but it doesn't look like you can buy Xcode 4.0 anymore without a paid developer account - it might not even be available to the developers - you might ask before paying money if you really need 4.0 and only 4.0.\n\nA: Here’s a link to Xcode 3.2.6 for Snow Leopard that I found on developer.apple.com. I couldn’t find versions 4.0 or 4.1.\n\nA: The site https://developer.apple.com/downloads has a search field. Enter \"Xcode\" and you will see \"Xcode 3.2.6 and iOS SDK 4.3 for snow leopard\". You can download a non App Store version of Xcode from there after signing up as a developer. \n\nA: You can get assorted versions of Xcode all the way back to Xcode 2.3 it seems.  You can do this without a paid account, but, you do have to register as an Apple Developer.\n", "Q: How to keep iPod in shuffle mode after selecting a specific song?

The iPhone 3GS is listed under “products affected” on the iOS 4.3.4 release notes.\n\nA: Apple have now released iOS 4.3.5, so they may have disabled the authentication for 4.3.4, as they do with all legacy versions of iOS.. Try downloading and installing iOS 4.3.5.\n\nA: Did you try to install the new firmware by clicking on \"Check for Update\" in iTunes? If so, you might want to try installing it manually. Download the correct firmware from http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=750 and option-click on \"Check for Update\" and select the file you previously downloaded.\nAs noted above, Apple tends to stop signing older versions when updating, so I'd directly try 4.3.5.\n\nA: After a crazy amount of googling… I FOUND THE ANSWER! It all lies in which authentication server your iTunes connects to when restoring or updating your iOS device. If your having the same problem as me, all you have to do is edit the HOSTS file under \n/private/etc\n\n(you can access this by rightcliking on finder in the dock and clicking \"go to folder…\" and entering in that folder location)\nFrom there, copy the HOSTS file to a place where you have access, and open it with text edit. Append this:\n#74.208.10.249 gs.apple.com\n#127.0.0.1 gs.apple.com\n\nand delete all other mentions of \"gs.apple.com\" and save the file. Copy this file back into the /private/etc folder, and replace the older one. Authenticate as needed. Now if you run the following terminal command:\nping gs.apple.com\n\nThe resulting IP address should be 17.112.176.11. IF something went wrong, it would be 74.208.10.249 or 127.0.0.1. If the ping is going to the right address, restart iTunes and try restoring or updating your iOS device, to discover that the problem is solved!\n", "Q: Installing Lion with duplicated installer I see many people asking how to save the Lion installer, and ofter the way to go is unpacking the installer and saving the disk image.\nIn my case, I saved the whole installer app (the same as downloaded) in an external disk before installing it in my iMac. Now, can I just copy the installer to my MacBook Pro and run it with no trouble? Or should I burn the disk? I don't really intend to burn it now, using the installer would be more practical.\n\nA: There is no reason that running it from the installer won't work.  That's the way Apple intended the installation to run, so that is probably the safest way to perform the upgrade.\n", "Q: How to install iOS 4.3.3 (not 4.3.4) on an iPhone 4 with 4.2.1? I just recently bought an iPhone 4.\nIt came with 4.2.1 firmware, and since 4.3.4 is released now it is not as simple as to just update the firmware with itunes. I have tried some good thing which tells you to use TinyUmbrella, but I didn't got it to work as I got error message 1604 when trying to restore. Anyone know how to upgrade to 4.3.3 firmware?\n\nA: TinyUmbrella is probably stopping you from updating your iPhone, because that creates a service that redirects port requests to itself rather than the Apple servers. I do not recommend using TinyUmbrella for anything unless you know exactly what it does and how to use it.\nThe reason you are having troubles is because you are probably trying to install the wrong IPSW file onto the iPhone.\nDownload the latest iTunes and install it (this will automatically update it) and then connect your iPhone, and in iTunes, request it to check for any iOS updates.\niTunes will download the required IPSW, get a certificate request from Apple servers and then install it. Problem solved.\n", "Q: Mac Mini not booting issue I'm looking for some troubleshooting ideas on my mac mini failing to boot. The machine had been working fine until 3 days ago. I purchased the mini second hand from a friend ~ 4 months ago.\nThe machine: Mac mini 1.83/2x512/80/SD/AP/BT   OSX - Snow Leopard   The attached peripherals to the mini are: USB mouse, USB non-Apple keyboard, ethernet, and display. \nHere are the symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on\n\n*Boot Chime continuously repeats ~ every second or so\n\n*The indicator LED is continuously lit\n\n*The keyboard indicator LED is NOT lit\n\n*Monitor is a blank gray screen\n\n\nI am not finding info on this set of symptoms in searches. What should I be considering with this set of symptoms?\nThank you. \n\nA: Sounds like a hardware issue. Insert your OS X CD and follow the instructions below from the Apple support pages to test your hardware\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate your 'Applications Install Disk 2' disk which came with your computer\n\n*Insert the disk into the computer\n\n*Boot/reboot the computer, holding the D down on your keyboard.  You should get an image like this once the test software has started to inspect your computer\n  \n\n*When the process is complete, select your language and click the right arrow. If you aren't using a mouse, you can use the up and down arrows to select a language and then press the Return key.\n\n\nThe Apple Hardware Test console appears. You can choose which sort of test or tests to perform:\n\n\n*\n\n*To perform all of the basic tests, click the Test button or press the \"T\" key or the Return key.\n\n*To perform a more thorough diagnostic test, select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox under the Test button before you click the Test button.\nYour test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nThe Hardware Profile tab of AHT provides specific information about your computer. To see this information, click the tab, then select a subject area on the left.\nTo exit AHT, click Restart or Shut Down at the bottom of the window. Remember that clicking Shut Down will not automatically eject the disc.\n\nNormally these are caused by hard disk failure, or at least a failure to boot from the hard disk.  If it turns out that it is the hard disk, you will need a new one.  But you may still be able to salvage data from the old one after you've replaced it.  If you get a USB hard drive caddy you can plug the old disk into your Mac after you've reinstalled the OS and if it is readable, you might be able to recover your data.  You may even be able to use migration assistant to recover everything if it turns out that it's just your boot sector that's corrupted.  \n\nA: This sounds to me like your HD is dead (it cannot find any drive to boot from). As @Griffo says, try inserting the OS X CD. First of all, if you are able to boot from that, this means it's probably only a HD-failure, now open disk-utility and check whether it can find your HD. If it can't, you should consider bringing your Mac to a APR or Apple Store.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade to Lion straight from 10.5.8? Can I upgrade to Lion from 10.5.8 without upgrading to 10.6.6 first?, or with a package deal?\nAnd can I upgrade just downloading? -- Without having to have the discs mailed to me?\n\nA: At the moment it is not possible to upgrade to Lion without first installing the App Store, and Apple hasn't announced any plan to make that available on versions older than Snow Leopard.\nFrom Apple's press release announcing Lion's availability:\n\nUsers who do not have broadband access at home, work or school can download Lion at Apple retail stores and later this August, Lion will be made available on a USB thumb drive through the Apple Store® (www.apple.com) for $69 (US).\n\nThey haven't confirmed that this will work for upgrading for older versions, but given the price many people are assuming that this is the case.\n\nA: You most certainly can upgrade, but it is a three (maybe two) step upgrade.\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade to 10.6 (this is a paid upgrade and you need Snow Leopard media - it is not sold or delivered as a download)\n\n*Run free patches to a minimum of 10.6.6 (unless your installer is very new)\n\n*Use the App Store to purchase and download Lion upgrade.\n\n\nYou won't be able to download everything, and it is not one step. As always, look well at all the add on software - much from Leopard era is PPC /rosetta or just tool old to run on two major upgrades. Also look well into hardware requirements. Not fun to spend the money to have Lion tell you your hardware is not compatible. So do:\n\n\n*\n\n*check your hardware for Lion compatibility\n\n*check your software for Lion compatibility\n\n*check your backup - perhaps checking it twice ;-)\n\n\nGood luck if you jump to Lion\n\nA: As others have noted, it's necessary to have Snow Leopard first to perform the upgrade. Technically it's possible to do the upgrade without snow Leopard installed on computer which you want to upgrade. If you have access to another Mac which is running Snow Leopard, you can burn an install DVD, once you've purchased Lion, and then do a fresh install on the Leopard machine. (I can confirm that this works - you may need to reformat the drive. This should be fine if you use time machine to do a backup first.) CNet has  a list of things to do before you upgrade. \n\nA: You can either wait until Apple releases Lion on a USB Drive (announced for August) or find someone who has 10.6.6 and the App Store, download Lion and burn a DVD.\nI do not know if the DVD or USB Drive can be used to upgrade 10.5 since I used it for a fresh install.\n\nA: You can't upgrade from 10.5 I suggest you take a backup on an external drive, partition your HD, download lion, install lion on the partition you created & when you boot from lion for the first time (mac restart automatically after installation) & the option to migrate your data comes up choose the option that migrates your files from a time machine backup.\nPS If it fails for some reason you still have all your files in your backup & in the 10.5 partition on your HD so there is no real risk here. FYI you can dual boot by holding down the option (alt) key during startup & then choose from which partition to boot from. Also if you enable file sharing on 10.5 you can access all your files while booted in Lion\n\nA: Yes you can! It is just 1 more step (see #4) from 10.5 to lion OS X\n\n\n*\n\n*Download from Appstore the lion os x \n\n*make a bootable dvd or usb or partition your internal drive \n\n*reboot with alt key and chose your source with burned .dmg on it\n\n*choose: disk utility and erase your internal drive completely\n\n*then start installation again and choose this new erased drive as a destination to recovery lion to it.\nit works!\n", "Q: Xcode 4 post installation problem I have successfully installed Xcode 4.1 from Mac AppStore on Lion, and restarted the machine to be sure that everything will run correctly, everything is ok up to this point. however, when I open Applications (and also when I open LaunchPad too), there is no XCode there, there is an icon named: \"install XCode\" (its size = XCode size = 3.5 GB, and contains a lot of packages inside it). I can run XCode without problems using either its icon on the dock or from spotlight.\nmy questions are: \n1) where is the real XCode Icon located ?\n2) what is the correct way to remove \"install XCode\" package icon that exists in Applications?\n3) can I put the \"install XCode\" package on a USB stick and install it on another machine (running Lion of course) without problems?\nthank you so much in advance.\n\nA: I know it's a bit confusing, but you didn't actually install Xcode 4. What you did was installing the Xcode 4 installer. So what you got to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Install Xcode-app located in your launchpad.\n\n*Make sure iTunes is closed, this is necessary, and the installer won't check for this.\n\n*Finalize the setup (well, Lion will do this for you, just press the buttons).\n\n*Optionally, restart your Mac.\n\n*Optionally, remove the Install Xcode-app.\n\n\nIt'll probably prompt you that it's moving your existing Developer-folder to Developer Old so it can install Xcode 4.1 to /Developer/.\n\nA: Both the above are correct:\nApple's App Store uses pretty confusing terminology. After you purchase/download an app, App Store marks it as \"installed\" when, in fact it's only been downloaded. The installer will be in your \"Applications\" folder and will then need to be run to actualy install the software.\nJust to add to the confusion, Xcode installs into a \"Developer\" folder at the root of your hard drive, not into the \"Applications\" folder. So, in summary; \"installed\" means \"downloaded\", downloads go into \"Applications\" not \"Downloads\" and [in the case of Xcode] the installed application doesn't end up in the \"Applications\" folder.\nSometimes Apple has very strange notions as to what constitutes user-friendliness!\nBTW - Installers downloaded from the App Store are automatically deleted, after they've been run. To avoid this [for example, if you want to install a downloaded app on more than one computer] it's a good idea to copy the installer to another location first, to prevent this \"auto-delete\" behaviour.\n\nA: *\n\n*It's in /Developer/Applications/\n\n*Not sure what you mean.\n\n*Likely.\n", "Q: Show Hidden Files OS X 10.7 Lion \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to show hidden files and folders in finder? \n\nHow do I show the hidden files in OS X 10.7 Lion?\n\nA: Open Terminal.app (Applications > Utilities) and type the following commands:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\nkillall Finder\n\nTo undo re-open Terminal.app and run\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE\nkillall Finder\n\n", "Q: Safari 5.1 (OS X Lion) Inspect Element / Web Inspector always pops up and is not docked to main window Been using OS X 10.7 Lion since early developer previews and there is this bug (or feature that's not implemented).

(hopefully possibly 0%)\n\nA: If the song is already in iTunes, it's easy to do it right within it. Go to the iTunes Preferences and choose \"Import Settings\" on the \"General\" page. You can set the desired output format here. Afterwards, select the songs you would like to convert and choose Advanced > Create XY Version, where XY is the file format you specified in the Import Settings. When iTunes has finished converting the files, you will have each track twice - you could use a smart playlist to filter the ones in the new format.\nBear in mind that converting from one lossy format to another lossy format will always result in a lower quality.\n\nA: You can download Max (then File > Convert file). \n\nMax can generate audio in over 20 compressed and uncompressed formats\n  including MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Apple Lossless, Monkey's Audio,\n  WavPack, Speex, AIFF, and WAVE.\nMax is integrated with MusicBrainz to permit automatic retrieval of\n  compact disc information. For MP3, FLAC, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Vorbis,\n  Monkey's Audio, WavPack, AAC and Apple Lossless files Max will write\n  this metadata to the output.\n\n\nA: QuickTime will export most sound files in the m4a container to many common formats, including mp3.

Whenever i visit a page using the web browser, then i simply jump to other applications, when i come back to the page again, the web browser will reload the url.\nIs there anyway to make it such that if i come back to the page again, simply show me whatever was shown previously, without any reloads whatsoever.\nI've noticed this problem to occur when i was switching tabs in the web browser as well. let's say I have 3 tabs, then i was at tab 1. then later i jump to tab 3, I do not wish to issue a page refresh.\nHow do we stop iphone from automatically performing all these annoying page reloads?\n\nA: What you're experiencing is the iPhone flushing pages from RAM to free up memory. There's no way to prevent this from happening, but some things that can alleviate it are keeping less pages open, and being mindful of the current number of apps that you're using that are taking up memory. As iOS needs memory for the current app, it'll kill off less recently used apps/pages.\n\nA: It is theoretically possible to change the virtual memory if you jailbreak the iOS, but even if you could, it might not be a good idea.\nWhat you can control is everything else. If you prevent the system from needing RAM by closing all of the other apps in the muti-tasking bar before starting safari, the chance that those web renders will get paged out of RAM is less.\nDo be aware, that the newer hardware has larger RAM - so the iPad 2 in practice keeps all 9 web pages in RAM much more regularly than the iPad will.

Holding ⇧ at the same time you can reposition the rectangle at along an axis. And if you hold only ⇧ you can resize the rectangle along an axis (in both cases depending on the direction you initially move the mouse).\nThis is quite handy if you need to make precise screenshots and you don't want to spend a lot of time post processing your screenshots.

Yet Apple seems to think this is possible judging by the second image in the scroller on this page (http://www.apple.com/displays/) (This image also shows a menu bar on the laptop and 2nd display, how is that done?)\nSo how can I individually set spaces per monitor?\n(also in the old spaces you could drag windows between monitors as well as spaces, is this not possible in Mission Control?)\n\nA: This is an excerpt of Appple's Application Kit Release Note for Lion regarding fills screen apps & multiple desktops.\nMultiple Monitors and Full Screen (New since early 2011 seed)\nWe have made some simplifying assumptions for Lion Full Screen\nbehavior on multiple monitors. Multiple monitors are treated as a single unit by Spaces, and therefore are also treated as a single unit in Full Screen. This means that all monitors will be dedicated to windows belonging to the full screen application, and there can be only one primary full screen window visible at a time. A secondary monitor is useful for inspector windows.\nSecondly, because the menu bar is located on the main monitor, the\nprimary full screen window will be located on the main monitor as well. This allows the menu bar, floating toolbar, and full screen window to maintain their interrelationship on the same monitor.\nfull document can be found here: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/Cocoa/AppKit.html\nAccording to this document it isn't possible.\n\nA: Put simply:\nIt isn't possible in Lion at the moment. Apple probably decided to follow the KISS principle (keep it simple, silly) and decided that the swipe should work on all monitors -- in effect having one large space rather than two smaller spaces. I see the logic, but personally would have preferred the choice.\nWhat really gets me (switching trains here, sorry) is that full screen apps essentially mute the second monitor (I get a nice canvas background). I get Apple's logic, but I hate it. If I wanted two full screen apps next to each other, I should be able to do it, but Apple won't let me. Oh well...\nThat said, full screen apps can utilize the second monitor -- such as using inspector panes and such (Photoshop should be nice like this...). So that's possibly what you're seeing in the marketing materials.\nAs to having the second menu bar -- it's probably a goof, but you can approximate the effect by using MenuEverywhere. It's not perfect, and I eventually gave up on it (it didn't always work reliably), but it's worth a try.\n\nA: I don't think this is currently possible.  Apple have been known to post marketing pictures which aren't entirely accurate as they are usually mockups and I think this is one of those cases.  It may be made possible by future updates, or it may be possible on development versions of OS X which Apple are running on test equipment but I'm quite sure this can't be done with the currently released version of Lion unless it's a feature of Final Cut Pro to be able to have multiple windows on multiple monitors.  Note that all the windows shown are for Final Cut Pro.  However, I suspect that the two menu bars is an oversight on somebody's part in the web development team\n\nA: Since taking pictures of computers screens causes glare and over all lack of clarity, pictures are taken of shutdown macs or macs displaying a bright green or blue colour and a screenshot is later edited in.

I've been meaning to migrate to IMAP access for a while now, and initial attempts to switch yesterday caused quite a bit of pain. I had problems ranging from 55000 messages trying to download, to being locked out of my account with the error message 'Account exceeded command or bandwidth limits.'\nI've found a useful looking reference, http://tidbits.com/article/10253, but it was written back in 2009, so I'm not sure how much of the information has been superseded in subsequent Mail upgrades. Does anyone else have experience and/or links to resources about using Gmail IMAP and Mail in Lion effectively?\n\nA: Firstly, if you're using Gmails two-factor authentication, you'll need to setup a one-time password for Mail.app to use.  From the look of it, you are not using this feature but you probably should and so should everybody else so I'll include the steps for completeness.  You can create a new one-time password by going to your Google Account settings (not Gmail settings).  You'll see a section like the one in the image below.\n\nClick on the 'Edit' beside 'Authorising applications & sites' and enter your google account password when prompted.  You'll be brought to a page where near the bottom you can name the app you're creating a one-time password for and then click create password.  See image below.\n\nYour password will be generated, spaces in it don't matter so you can just select it and copy to the clipboard.  Then open the Mail.app and if you don't get the dialog for adding an account, you can bring it up by clicking Mail > Preferences and you can click the '+' symbol at the bottom-left to add a new account.  Put your gmail address, including 'gmail.com' in the 'Email Address' field and you newly generated one-time password in the 'Password' field and hit Enter.\nMail will connect to the server and validate then setup your account.\nClick 'Create' when prompted and you're ready to go.  \nNow, to manage the mail that your Mac will download and store locally you go to the Advanced tab for the account.  There is a dropdown (pictured below) which allows you to select what Mail will download.\n\nIf you don't want to download all mail and attachments, change the default to one of the other options shown below.\n \n\n\n*\n\n*If you select 'All messages and their attachments' this will download every email you've ever sent/received which still exists in your online gmail account.  This is the default and probably the reason you exceeded your limit.  This should be a one-off problem though if you downloaded them all and this is what you want.  \n\n*If you select 'All messages but omit attachments', it will still download every mail you've ever sent as above, just without the additional bulk of attachments.  \n\n*If you select 'Only messages I've read' then Mail won't download unread messages, leaving you to read your unread mail on gmail in your web browser.  \n\n*If you select 'Don't keep copies of any messages' then you will only ever see mail in your Mail app when you are online.  Essentially this will function as if you're using your web-based email account on gmail.com but through the Mail app.  This means you don't use lots of storage on your Mac, but it also means you need to have an internet connection to use your account.  \n\n\nI hope that clarifies your choices and helps you choose the best option which suits your needs.  Also, if you're going to use IMAP, which you probably should, you should stop using POP.  \nIn GMail settings, you can also limit the number of mails which can be held in an IMAP folder to various limits between 1000 and 10000  \n\nA: Furthermore, after Griffo's excellent advice above, you should consult this Google Help document on how to configure Apple Mail to work optimally with GMail over IMAP.\nhttp://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=78892#\n\nApple Mail\nFrom the Mail menu, click Preferences > Accounts > Mailbox Behaviors\nDrafts: Store draft messages on the server > do NOT check\nSent: Store sent messages on the server > do NOT check\nJunk: Store junk messages on the server > checked Delete junk messages\n  when > Never\nTrash: Move deleted messages to the Trash mailbox > do NOT check Store\n  deleted messages on the server > do NOT check\n\n", "Q: Why does my MacBook Pro suddenly die instead of remaining in sleep mode? I have a MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo (Pre-unibody) running Snow Leopard that fails to stay in sleep mode when the battery is run down to 0%.\nThis problem just started a month ago. The battery is new. It runs down fine and I get a warning when the reserve battery kicks in at 10%, but when it reaches 0, it goes into sleep mode for about 1 second and then dies.\nWhen I boot back up, it tries to recover but fails and then just reboots as normal. I tried recalibrating the battery and I also tried resetting the PMU but to no avail.\nIf anyone has any ideas, I'm open to suggestions.\n\nA: You may need to recalibrate for the new battery. Use the computer until you get the warning message. Then, shut down and plug it in. Let it charge fully before you turn it back on. Doing this will allow the system to calibrate for the new battery so that it can more accurately tell how much charge is remaining, which could help if it thinks the battery will last longer than it does.\n\nA: The notebook is supposed to enter into safesleep mode once it goes to sleep with less than 10% battery remaining.  It records everything to hard drive and fully powers down so it doesn't use more battery power keeping the memory alive.\nHowever in your case it doesn't have enough energy left to spin the hard drive up and record everything.  In fact, if you've only been browsing, or reading, the hard drive might not have even been on while you've been using it - and suddenly it spins up, spikes the power consumption while writing the memory to the drive, and then shuts down due to low voltage.\nYou can try the calibration routine with one modification: when you get the 10% warning, put it to sleep and let it sleep for 5 or more hours.  Then plug it in before you wake it up.  \nIf the calibration routine still isn't working properly, I suggest you take the laptop and new battery to the genius bar, discharged to 10% so they can run it down there, and let them handle it.  They'll either get it to calibrate, or they'll replace the battery if it's a new Apple battery.\nThis shouldn't be happening, so don't hesitate to have them support you.\nIf you're out of warranty, or you're using a third-party battery, then you might try applications such as http://www.axoniclabs.com/DeepSleep/ which force the laptop to go into safesleep mode (hibernate) rather than sleep mode.\nIf you are using a third party replacement battery, talk to their technical support.  It's obviously not fully compatible with your laptop if it's not calibrating correctly.  It could be that it will never calibrate if they've skimped on the smarts inside the battery.\nIf nothing else works and you can't afford to repair the laptop or battery once the genius bar tells you what's wrong, don't keep using it once it gives you the 10% warning.  Put it to sleep until you can charge it, and repair the laptop or replace the battery when you can get to it.\n", "Q: How can I enable pinch to zoom in Finder on OS X Lion?

Is resetting the iPad 2 to factory settings the only way?\nI obviously do not physically have it in front of me anymore. I don't mind passing my password to my sister, and having her sign into her local iTunes with my account to deauthorize it, but she says that to do that she would lose all her current iTunes data.\nAlso, if there is a way to deauthorize it without a reset, will the apps I purchased still be accessible to her on the device?\n\nA: Have her go to Settings.app > Store - if your account is signed in, sign out. She can then sign in to her own account. Any apps you've downloaded using that account will still prompt for that account's password when they need updating, though.\n", "Q: Problem setting terminal window bounds with AppleScript Problem trying to solve\nI use multiple terminal windows to develop web applications.  I'll have a terminal open for vim, a terminal open for git and a terminal open for basic file/directory commands.  The terminal application doesn't remember window settings so whenever I quit the terminal or have to restart I must manually resize and position my terminal windows.  I would like to automate this process using AppleScript.\n\n\n*\n\n*1 window, big, fills up left half of screen (vim)\n\n*2 windows, smaller, stacked on top of one another, filling up other half of screen\n\n\nMy attempted solution\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n\n    activate\n    set the bounds of the front window to {5, 0, 1000, 950}\n    do script \"clear\" -- opens up the second window\n    set the bounds of the front window to {1105, 0, 400, 500}\n    -- haven't gotten to third window yet   \n\nend tell\n\nThe problem\nThe second window, the one being created by do script \"clear\", is being positioned oddly.  The left, top and height are all behaving as expected.  However, the window is set to it's minimum width, regardless of the value passed in the width parameter.  It could be 1000 and it's still set to minimum.  I've search high and low on Google, SO, Super User and Ask Different with no luck.\nAny advice on what I'm doing wrong or what could be causing this issue with the weird width on the window created by do script \"clear\"?\nDisclaimer\nI'm an AppleScript beginner.  The syntax is unlike anything I've ever worked with (PHP, VBA, JavaScript) and I'm almost positive this is not the best, or even correct, way to be doing what I want to do.  However, I don't know AppleScript enough to really tell, other than gut feeling.\n\nA: The window bounds are a list of coordinates {left, top, right, bottom}. You probably intended \"400\" to be the width, but it's the position of the right edge of the window and 400 is to the left of 1105, so you get a minimum width window. Change 400 to 1105 plus the desired width, e.g., 1505.\nBut before you pursue this further, Terminal has a better solution for this: Window Groups. If you set up a group of windows and save them as a Window Group, each time you open that group it will create windows with the same layout and appearance.\n\nWindow > Save Windows as Group…\n\nYou can even tell Terminal to open a selected window group at startup:\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Startup > On startup, open: > Window group:\n\n(As a shortcut, when creating a window group there's a checkbox for making it the startup group.)\nTo automatically run particular commands in those windows, you can create custom settings profiles and specify the command with\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Settings > [profile] > Shell > Startup > Run command:\n\nthen create each window with the appropriate profile.\nGoing further, in Mac OS X Lion 10.7 you can have window groups automatically restore commands without creating custom profiles, by creating the terminals using\n\nShell > New Command\n\ninstead of running the command inside the terminal shell. When creating the window group, you can check \"Restore all commands\". (By default, it will restore a small set of \"safe\" commands, but you must explicitly tell it if you want it to re-run all commands when opening the group.)\nMoreover, Lion Terminal supports Resume and will automatically restore all your windows each time you open Terminal. It will even restore \"safe\" commands for terminals created with New Command.\n", "Q: How can I show the \"Dimension\" column in Finder?

I've only noticed it in folders containing videos, but I haven't tracked which types. Other folders containing the same video types don't necessarily offer those columns. When the columns are available, they appear in the list's column header contextual menu, but not in the window's View Options.\nHow do I go about posting my screenshot of this? I don't have 10 reputation pokes or likes or smiles or whatevers.\n\nA: When in icon view, you can use \"Show item info\" under view options just as user6124 described.\n\nYes, but this is not the 'column' view. Thanks, but I knew this already. – Nimbuz (comment)\n\nColumn view, however, prefers to show as much of the current file tree path as possible at the price of extra info. You can enable the preview column from view options to show a preview of the selected image along with some basic information (including pixel dimensions) in the rightmost column.\nThe preview column only shows the info for the selected file (just one).\nIn list and cover flow views you can add more info columns to the list by right–clicking the list's titlebar and choose the extra data you want to see:\n\nNOTE: The list of extra columns is relative to the folder's location. In order to get the dimensions available, the folder in question has to reside somewhere under ~/Pictures/. (Under ~/Music/ you could choose e.g. artist or album and under ~/Movies/ you could choose length or codecs and so on…)\n\nA: User10355, I know this post is old, but if someone comes across it, they may read your comment and give up without trying. Nobody's memory was playing tricks. For the \"Pictures\" folder only, the 9 columns listed in the \"View Options\" panel are not the only columns available in List View! Right-click any column header and a dropdown menu appears showing the full range of options. For the Pictures folder, this includes the 9 columns offered in View Options, plus two more: dimensions and resolution. My screenshot is from El Capitan, but it sounds as if this feature was available as far back as Mountain Lion.\n\n\nA: Your memory is playing tricks on you. This is the Finder from Snow Leopard (which I don't think changed from Leopard).\n\nAnd here is Tiger's list view column options:\n\n", "Q: How can I reinstall Mac OS X (Lion) without erasing data? My Lion installation ruined. Everything doesn't work. Even my Mac doesn't sleep. I want to reinstall whole OS, but I have no spare backup drive. So I want to reinstall OS without erasing or repartitioning to keep my data on disk.\nI know it's not clear enough, but it should be a lot better than my current installation. So I want to try anything if it keep my data without backup.\nIs this possible? How can I do this?\nOr is there any way to repair current installation?\n\nA: Reboot your Mac. When you hear the boot chime, hold the COMMAND + R keys. You will enter the Lion Recovery environment. From there, simply choose to reinstall Lion. It will simply remove the current system and replace it with a fresh copy. None of your data will be deleted or moved. The only thing that will be replaced will be the core system files. There is no longer any need to make backups, migrate your data, or mess with partitioning.\nIf you'd like to read more about the Lion Recovery function, go here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718\n\nA: I'm in the same boat. Kernel panics malloc errors everywhere PAH!\nAnyway: \nDownload Lion. The install eats the file you need so don't install it right away. Only took me 2x +XCODE to figure that out. \nNow, if you installed it you can do the brutal cmd-R on boot to get to the recovery partition.  That's nice, you can now install Lion via your hopefully working network, as well as wiping the badness from your drive.  \nThis sucks, since you probably did not save the download. \nReally, you want to get a copy of Lion on a USB key.\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications > Install Lion > show package contents > find and mount the InstallESD file.\n\n*Break out one of your many 16 gig USB keys and erase it.  You're going to restore the InstallESD image onto the USB Key.\n\n*Check with diskutil, the gui in Lion is sexy, but underneath is a sea of malloc(3)-y kernel panics. It needs to be bootable.\n\n*It' won't boot.  Thats OK, use the Recovery Partition ( cmd R on boot ) and set the USB key as your startup disk.\n\n*Reboot.  Try not to think about how you swore this time you'd wait until .1.\nYou should be back in what looks like the same place, except it should be from your USB key, which can install lion onto the wiped hard drive. \nI shall attempt this last part right now, all I want is the oblivion of the zeroes ... perhaps my tinkering with snow leopard was the problem.

Is there software and/or drivers that support using the Kinect to replicate the same behavior triggered by the Multitouch gestures? Would it be possible for me to swipe my hand leftward in the air and switch to a different desktop or space, for example?\nIt would seem there's two steps to make this work. The first would be to establish Kinect-to-Mac communication. We know this is already possible by the various hacks already available.\nThe second component we'd need is to translate one form of USB input (the Kinect's) to be assignable to the multitouch gestures. We know this may be possible because software like BetterTouchTool allows nearly infinite customization of multitouch gestures.\nSo... is this possible?\n\nA: Possible? Yes. Available? Not yet. There have been plenty of reports of people using the Kinect with OSX but no one as of yet has release any definitive software package that allows for gestures to be used. Most people don't seem to be releasing their software.\nCheck out this video:\nhttp://www.kinecteducation.com/blog/2011/04/20/kinect-controls-mac-os-x/\nIt's the closest thing I've seen to what you are asking.\nEDIT:\nThere is a step by step guide to getting the Kinect to connect with the Mac here:\nhttp://kinecthacks.net/connecting-kinect-to-mac-os-x/\nSo if you wanted to mess with it yourself, that would be the place to start.\n\nA: The official answer is \"no\". Microsoft offers an SDK for the windows OS only, but nothing is available through Apple or Microsoft to develop directly on OS X. Your best bet (today) is to get Windows running in a VM and start hacking to see if you can make use of the easy solution that is supported by Microsoft.\nThe unofficial answer, is of course. It's just a hardware input device and given enough knowledge, anyone can program something that will read the data coming from the kinect and use it to do cool things. The most robust place for finding libraries that work on Linux, Mac and Windows along with a lot of helpful documentation is at the open kinect site.\n", "Q: Can Aperture auto-delete photos after import from an iPhone I'm trying out Aperture to see whether I should upgrade from iPhoto.

After importing photos from my photo with Aperture I didn't get an option to delete the originals from the phone. Am I missing a config option somewhere, or does Aperture not offer this functionality? \n\nA: Aperture does not seem to offer this functionality for the iPhone.

I live in a country where Internet isn't that broadbandish, I installed Lion on my home laptop and want to copy the updates to my Mac Mini.\nIs there a way to copy Apple updates from a machine to another?\n\nA: You could, but not by using Software Update.\nWhat you should do, is wait for Apple to release the update on its website, here is the 10.7.1 update, store it on a USB drive and install it wherever you want.\n\nA: You can copy Lion to another machine, but only if you do so before you run the installer on the original machine -- the last thing the installer does is to wipe itself. So I'm afraid it's too late now.\n\nA: You can set up an OS X server, which can act as a local Software Update server. I.e. it downloads the updates from Apple, then distributes them to your machines. Unless you already have a server or have a spare machine and are interested in setting this up, this is a rather impractical solution, but I wanted to mention it for completeness.\n\nA: What you should do is download the .pkg installer. When you update your software, you should be able to save the .pkg. Under Updates there is an option to \"Install and Keep Package\" Use this option.\n", "Q: Unsaved Files in OS X Lion Where do unsaved files go in Lion?\nI quit TextEdit without saving since I had no intention of saving, but with autosave the file still got save somewhere since when I reopen TextEdit the file I was working on is there (even tough I disabled resume >.<). So I was wondering were did that file get saved?\n\nA: The primary place to look for unsaved changes for TextEdit is ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information/\nIt depends on the state of the document, and it is complicated (since unsaved changes could also exist once the file has been saved and named the first time). \n\nUnsaved documents\nThe first type — \nthe \"behind the scenes\" starter files — start as temporary files in /private/var/folders/… and are eventually stored in ~/Library/Containers/. They are named untitled and untitled 2 and so on. Each app gets it's own directory, and for TextEdit - you'll look for a file like ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information/Unsaved TextEdit Document.rtf\nThese untitled documents do not get a proxy icon in the title bar — just the name chosen by TextEdit:\n\nYou don't get any versions, locking or notification of changes other than the normal undo/redo buffer with these unsaved files. \n⌘+S\nThe first Save enables the versioned storage and all that goes along with it. This is when the file gets a more familiar location in the file system, a chance for a name other than untitled X. The proxy icon is the clue this is no longer an AutoSave document.\n\nThe file is no longer stored solely in ~/Library/Containers/ — the first edition is saved wherever the user chooses in the file open/save dialog. \nEdition(s) to a saved document\nAny modification to a saved document will cause the word Edited to appear in its title bar:\n \nThe file above has: \n\n\n*\n\n*the version that was explicitly saved by you \n\n*plus edition that is automatically saved by the System.\n\n\nAt this point, you have the full range of tools to roll back changes with that file:\n\n\n*\n\n*the undo buffer\n\n*the auto save or versions data in ~/Library/Containers/\n\n*the last saved state in the filesystem\n\n*the versions store from /.DocumentRevisions-V100\nSaving a version will cause the word Edited to disappear from the title bar. This is where a versions menu will be shown if you hover around the file name and an entire versions infrastructure takes over. I'll leave the mechanics of that for another answer - this is long enough. \n\n\nLots of other files get updated when TextEdit creates and modifies files:\n\n\n*\n\n*the list of recent files\n\n*the list of currently open files for when the app itself quits\n\n*the state of the app to replay in case the Mac reboots (even unexpectedly).\n\n\nThe System approaches to auto save and versions should ensure that: \n\n\n*\n\n*data is never lost when TextEdit quits normally\n\n*no more than a few seconds of edition are lost if the application quits unexpectedly.\n\n\nA: According to John Siracusa's review of Lion it is saved in /.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\nA: According to Apple's developer documentation, any new documents that you haven't yet saved explicitly are autosaved in ~/Library/Autosave Information:\n\nAutomatic document saving is supported by the implementation of autosaving in place. Autosaving in place and autosaving elsewhere both protect against the user losing work due to application crashes, kernel panics, and power failures. However, autosaving in place differs from autosaving elsewhere in that it overwrites the actual document file rather than writing a new file next to it containing the autosaved document contents. (Autosaving in place performs a safe save by writing to a new file first, then moving it into the place of the document file when done.)\nThe document architecture still uses autosaving elsewhere to save untitled documents that have content but have not been explicitly saved and named by the user. In this case, untitled documents are autosaved in ~/Library/Autosave Information. In addition, NSDocument saves earlier revisions of documents elsewhere, giving the user access to previous versions.\n\nThe part that says “In addition, NSDocument saves earlier revisions of documents elsewhere” refers to the hidden .DocumentRevisions-V100 folder I assume.\nSo if you've had the new document open sufficiently long for it to have been autosaved more than once, this all should imply that the latest version is stored in a file in ~/Library/Autosave Information while earlier versions have been stored in the .DocumentRevisions-V100 folder (at the root of the drive on which your home folder resides).\nSide note: this does leave me wondering whether the files in ~/Library/Autosave Information also get automatically deleted at some point, to avoid piling up these types of quick TextEdit documents you had no intention of saving. The Library is not a folder that inexperienced users should have to muck about in; and as far as I understood, Lion now even hides it by default. I presume its contents also don't show up in Spotlight. If the files don't get automatically deleted, the Desktop or the Documents folder would have seemed to be better destinations for autosaving.\n\nA: It seems the location for untitled, unsaved files varies from application to application. Use spotlight to find your unsaved temporary file, regardless of which autosave-enabled application you used to create it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the autosave-enabled application\n\n*Navigate to the window of the untitled document you want to locate in the file system\n\n*Add a distinct string (e.g., zyzyx)\n\n*Quit the application\n\n*In spotlight (command+space) type zyzyx\n\n*your modified file should come up. Hover over it with the mouse to see a preview. Command click on the file to go to the enclosing folder in Finder.\n\n\nA: ~/Library/Containers\nThis directory serves multiple purposes, some of which may be not yet documented by Apple. \nUntitled, Unsaved documents for supporting applications\nApplications such as Preview and TextEdit.\nExample\nCopy an image to your clipboard. Open Preview, close all windows, use the New from Clipboard command, quit. \nOpen TextEdit, close all windows, type something in a new window, quit. \nIn Terminal, run two commands: \nls -@l ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information\nls -@l ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information\nUnsaved… files will be listed.\nSystem-saved versions of user-saved files, where the file system or volume does not support permanent version storage\nFile systems such as MS-DOS (FAT); volumes mounted using AFP 3.3 or SMB; and so on. \nExample\nMake an AFP or SMB connection to a file server. Use Preview to open an image on that server, edit that image, quit without saving a version, disconnect from the server. \nIn Terminal, run a command: \nls -lrt ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Autosave\\ Information\nAt the foot of the list will be a directory that contains the version automatically saved by the System. \nIn the same network environment: if you re-open Preview, the system may reconnect to the file server. Then in a version browser view of the remote file, the timeline will include a local file. \n(I could go into greater detail, but it would be off-topic from the opening question.)\nOther purposes\nBeyond the two purposes noted above, ~/Library/Containers may have other purposes. \nHint\nAllow the System to manage files in these areas. \nAvoid dataloss; do not attempt unnecessary changes to ~/Library or its subdirectories. \n\nA: I found my files in by doing a TM backup and was able to recover some of these unsaved edits (but not the one I was looking for). I found the files in the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information/ folder.. So thanks and a TM back up might be of help for some..\n", "Q: Is X11 installed by default on Mac OS X?

One of the neat new (though understated) features of Lion is Whole Disk Encryption. Before  I flick the switch, I'd love to know what the performance impacts (speed and battery impacts) of switching it on. \nThere are some great articles with qualitative data (see below - not to mention a good Ask Different Question), however it would be great to have some quantitative (or even anecdotal) stories of people who Filevault 2 has, or hasn't worked for. \nWhat implications have you experienced in speed and battery life using Filevault 2?\n\n\nUsing FileVault 2: Performance impacts\n  Once you have Filevault 2 enabled, you will not notice any performance changes. Whether it is real or a matter of perception, your files feel like they open just as fast. Your apps launch without any additional delay. Your backups via Time Machine work the same, etc.\n  (themaclawyer.com)\n\nand\n\nAll forms of whole disk encryption benefit from the current imbalance between CPU power and disk speed. In almost all circumstances, the CPU in your Mac spends most of its time twiddling its thumbs with nothing to do. This is especially true for operations that involve a lot of disk access.\nWhole disk encryption takes advantage of this nearly omnipresent CPU cycle glut to sneak in the tiny chunks of work it requires to encrypt and decrypt data from the disk. Apple also leverages the special-purpose AES instructions and hardware on Intel's newest CPUs, further reducing the CPU overhead. The end result is that regular users will be hard-pressed to notice any reduction in performance with encryption enabled. Based on my experience with the feature in prerelease versions of Lion, I would strongly consider enabling it on any Mac laptop I plan to travel with. (Ars Technica)\n\n\nA: Other than making sure you have power available when you turn on or off the entire disk's worth of IO to encrypt/decrypt, performance and power deltas are barely measurable.\nLess than 1-2% is what I'm seeing. Other than hammering large IO benchmarks, in practice it doesn't matter one bit whether FileVault 2 is on or off for the initial build of Lion.\nAs long as you understand the limitations of not being able to use file recovery tools, how people can circumvent your encryption by losing control of pass phrases or keys, it seems this lunch is free (or at least on Apple's tab).\n\nA: I have a 2011 uMBP 15\" i7 QC, 8GB RAM, with a OCZ Vertex 3 256GB SSD & Corsair F120.  AFTER enabling FileVault 2, I did notice a throughput penalty (VERTEX 3) specifically, large file size write. Sequential reads showed 2-5% impact. Where write-throughput dropped >100MB/s.  I owe the forum a more detailed comparison. \nRegardless, having a secure volume with still-impressive throughput speeds is great. \nI foresee the next few \"iterations\" of industry SSD products/benchmarks to include whole-disk encryption performance...an evolutionary competitive differentiator. \n", "Q: Snow Leopard vs. Lion performance: what are the differences?

I have a iPod Classic 160 Gb. I have forgotten the generation. Is there any way by which I can find out the generation of the iPod?\n\nA: See Apple's note on identifying which iPod model you have.\n\nA: Check out MacTracker.  It's a free app with information on pretty much everything that Apple has ever made.\n", "Q: Is it possible to move all windows from one space to the other? Is there a way to move all the windows found in one space into another without having to move them one by one?\n(This feature was available in Snow Leopard)\n\nA: You can still do this in OS X Lion.\nMove to the space you want to move the application's windows to. Right-click on the application icon in your Dock, select Options and enable \"This Desktop\" in the sub-menu. All of the windows should now move over to the current space.\nOut of interest, how do you do this in Snow Leopard?\nEdit: At last, I found a way to do this. Open Mission Control, and left-click and drag the application icon under the application windows to a new space at the top of the screen. You can create a new space entirely, or move all of the windows to an existing space. Hope this helps.\n\nA: You can't at least for now, hope Apple adds more functionality to Mission Control. Although you can move all windows of a particular app between spaces....\n", "Q: Is OpenOffice for Mac OS X ready for use? I am helping a friend set up a brand-new MacBook. She is migrating from a Windows environment and is used to OpenOffice. I have very little OS X experience.\nOpenOffice 3.3 has a native Aqua port for OS X > 10.3.\nIs this port regarded stable and ready for end users? Is it fully integrated into the OS X environment like Apple's own iWork, or are there shortcomings or compromises one needs to be aware of?\n\nA: I used Open Office, it does the job ok. No crashes, quite feature complete. However if you really don't want to pay anything for an office suite, I'd go for Google Docs. \nIf you do want to pay, then definitely go for iWork. It's the only one that's fully integrated with OS X (especially if you have Lion).\n\nA: I have used OpenOffice. It does work, but personally I find it to be a bit slow, because it runs on Java. It certainly does work, though. Also, unlike Google Docs, it's usable offline.\nWhen I had OpenOffice installed and I would accidentally click on a spreadsheet, I cringed at the impending system slowdown. It's not terrible, but I didn't find it to be as snappy as I would have liked to expect from software in 2011. (This was likely because I had several other apps open at the same time, but still - I wouldn't have the same issues with certain other native apps.)\nIn my opinion, iWork is certainly the way to go, since you can purchase it for relatively cheap from the App Store and re-download it whenever necessary. (On multiple machines too!) \n\nA: I have been using Open Office for years.  Not extensively, but when someone sends me a Word or Excel document (and I have no Microsoft at all on my machine) I can use Open Office to read them, modify them, save them, send them back.\n", "Q: Screen Sharing stopped working after Lion upgrade Screen Sharing stopped working after I upgraded to Lion. Trying to connect back home to my still yet not upgraded Snow Leopard machine.\nLogs says\n\nPM Screen Sharing: MVS Codec - bad rectangle size - clossing connection 0\n\nHas anyone else notice this?\n\nA: Not at all - I have three classes of macs that all worked flawlessly with the upgrade to Lion. They all share their screens with the basic VNC technology:\n\n\n*\n\n*basic OS X - turn on VNC or remote management - bonjour location is local\n\n*basic plus MobileMe back to my mac for locating the mac over the internet\n\n*basic plus Screens app from edovia to locate the mac over the internet\n\n\nI haven't seen a good Apple writeup of the Lion changes - but when you log in with your OS account rather than with the VNC password - you get a distinct loginwindow process for that account whether or not that user is shown as logged in locally. This change could be causing you grief.\nPut another way - screen sharing and log in is now a virtual concept - you are no longer limited to one mac log in session or tied tightly to the physical screen. User A can be using the mac and User B logs in remotely and gets their own workspace rather than seeing what A is doing or forcing A to log off.\nThe writeup inside the screens app is nice if you have purchased it.\n\nA: I found that Screen Sharing was working, but I couldn't see the window showing the remote machine. I could only figure that out by being in the same room with the remote machine. :)\nWhen I changed the display quality setting, choosing \"Full Quality\", then choosing \"Adaptive Quality\" again, Screen Sharing resized the window showing the remote machine, then I could see it. I don't know whether the old window was 0x0 size or off-screen.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: I had a problem with connecting from my Lion MacBook to my SL iMac. It turned out that I needed to go into Sharing under System Preferences on the iMac, toggle off \"Screen Sharing\" and toggle on \"Remote Management.\" Then they started connecting again.\n", "Q: How do I quickly change the current calendar being used for new events in Lion? I have different calendars for various types of things that I use to schedule my days.  This involves switching between the different calendars for different kinds of events when doing the scheduling.  In Snow Leopard, I could just select the calendar I wanted by clicking on it on the left.  With Lion, it looked like I might be able to get the same functionality with the little \"Calendar\" button in the upper left, but that just seems to allow me to rename the Calendars, without actually setting one as being currently active for creating new events.  \nI can edit each event individually, but that is rather tedious.  (Though Going into advanced preferences, and clicking the \"Open events in a separate window\" reduces the pain somewhat)\nI can also set the default calendar in preferences, but that is even more tedious than editing the events.\nSo, how do I quickly change the current calendar being used for new events in Lion?\n\nA: Change the default calendar to \"last selected calendar\" then clicking a calendar via the \"Calendar\" button pop-over will actually set the currently active calendar for new events.\n", "Q: How do I get archive to work in Mail.app in Lion? I can't get archive to work on Lion. When I choose archive in Mail.app it creates a folder called Archived. That's not what I want. When I choose delete it doesn't remove the message from my inbox. It is just greyed out. Right now I leave the messages in the inbox and archive them from my iPhone, which works great. Please help me get this working.\n\nA: If you're okay using Mail's delete function as archive, then simply go into Mail > Preferences > Accounts > Gmail > Mailbox Behaviors and deselect both of these options:\n[ ] Move deleted messages to the Trash mailbox\n[ ] Store deleted messages on the server\nScreenshot:\n\nThen when you delete a message in Mail, you'll be archiving it.\nReference here:\nhttps://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=78892\n\nA: I had the same problem, and it turned out that I had to enable Auto-expunge in gmail settings; otherwise actions performed in Mail don't sync up to the gmail server in a timely fashion. Just enable auto-expunge.\n", "Q: Advanced find in files tools for OS X? I am looking for a tool that would allow me to do fast searches inside files, something considerably more complex than what finder provides.\nFeatures looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*file extension filtering (include/exclude)\n\n*directory selection, eventual defining search groups\n\n*unicode support\n\n*replace functionality (optional)\n\n*save/load presets (optional)\n\n\nAlso, it has to be fast and be able to search in >100.000 files without putting the computer down.\n\nA: Once you get beyond simply searching in files and enter the realm of doing things like find/replace and file extension filtering, you can't get faster or more extensible than Unix tools like sed, awk, and grep (or ack), particularly when working on hundreds of thousands of files, as you specify.\nBash supports file globbing, so you can easily do extension filtering. Pipe the filtered files into sed for search and replace. I'm not sure exactly what kind of presets you're looking for, but if you find yourself doing the same type of thing often you can put together a script with common \"presets\".\nI've tried TextMate and TextWrangler, and both slow down considerably when running on lots of files. I'd highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the above tools, if you haven't already.\n\nA: mdfind is the way to go for anything looking inside a file. You can filter the hits later with perl or grep or whatever alse you wish. \nIf using spotlight isn't something you can do and really want a tool that reads thousands of files bbfind which is part of BBEdit is the way to go.\n\nA: The Mac OS X Spotlight gives you most of these features:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder, navigate to a specific directory\n\n*Start typing the search term to the search text box at the top right of the Finder\n\n*Now you will see a \"Search:\" bar right below your search term, press the (+) button at the far right to add your search criteria. If the criteria is not in the list, select 'other' and you will find it there (File extension is in this category).\n\n\nGranted, Spotlight does not satisfy some of your requirements such as excluding the file extension, but it is a good start. If you want more power, google for \"enhanced spotlight\" and you will find applications which might fit your needs. Finally, if you are command-line savvy, check out the 'find' command.\n", "Q: How can I rip a DVD so that it has multiple audio tracks and subtitles available when synced with my iPad? I'm in the process of ripping my DVD collection to disk for backup, syncing with my iPad, and protecting from my toddlers.\nI'd like to have the commentary (if available) and subtitles with the video file, but I do not want the subtitles burned in.\nI can't figure out how to make any of the programs I usually do this with work with the iPad. RipIt provides that beautiful .dvdmedia file from which I can simply watch the DVD in DVD Player.app but it's compress feature doesn't bring over anything but the default audio track and it doesn't deal with subtitles. HandBrake provides the option of Burning in the subtitles, which is not what I want, but when I don't burn in the subtitles, the iPad seems to be unable to deal with them, even though I believe QuickTime X does know what to do. Of course, VLC or any other reasonably powerful video player can display them just fine.\nShort of encoding them twice, is there a way to get what I want?\n\nA: You could check out subler, it's a great .mp4 swiss army knife, and supports soft subtitles. I've used it with success with my Apple TV 2, and it work without issue, although I haven't tried on my iPad yet.\n\nA: I'm sorry to say that the native video player in iOS is quite lacking in features.\nSwitch to VLC for iOS. You'll be able to play your Handbrake-produced files without problems, switching between multiple subtitles, audio tracks, etc.\n\nA: Have you looked at RipIt? It rips DVD's with all of its features. You're essentially creating a disc image with the same data as the DVD. You can play this file in DVD Player. RipIt has a compress feature that compresses the DVD video into an iTunes/iOS friendly format. I am not 100% sure, but I believe subtitles are included in the file. You can check out their website and try the app for free. \n", "Q: How can I track detailed analytics for my iTunes Library? Is there a way to view an \"iTunes Analytics Dashboard\" or some type of plugin that would have similar capabilities?\nThere's all this really good data locked up in iTunes, from Play Counts to Ratings to Last Played Date, etc... but I'd like a beautiful interface to view detailed charts and graphs that break things down simply yet informatively.\nThis could hypothetically be marketed as \"Personal Media Collection Analytics Software\" going above and beyond what conventional media player software currently offers.\nSample capabilities:\n - proportion of 5-star tracks vs. 3-star tracks\n - which month do I listen to genre X or artist Y the most \n - at what hour of the day do I prefer songs with BPM > X\n - etc...\n\nA: Last.fm and its API opened to developers gave birth to some nice web applications. Of course, you must have an account (free) and scrobble your songs to benefit from them.  \nTwo of them related to analytics (I'm not a specialist, I guess there must be other ones) :\nhttp://www.mymusichabits.com/visualize/cosmokraymer\nhttp://lastgraph.aeracode.org/user/cosmokraymer/\nThe latter enables you to generate visually impressive timelines of your listening habits ...\n\n... and play history for each of your artists\n\n\nA: I don't know of anything that will do all of what you want, but there is this app that will give you some stats on your library.\n\nA: I use Super Analyzer, a handy Java app that scans your \"iTunes Library.xml\" file. Get it here \n", "Q: Is there any way to apply open-ended keyword tags to songs in iTunes? Other iLife apps like iPhoto already support this functionality, like assigning \"vacation\" or \"mountains\" keywords to certain photos.\nIs it possible to add tags to songs in iTunes without resorting to the rigid options currently provided (i.e. the 'Comments' or 'Grouping' fields)? See this mock-up for an idea of what this type of tagging would be like:\n\nIn the above mock-up, we could assign sub-genres to a song. This would allow us to create smart playlists based on these sub-genres or do whatever else we'd like with them.\nCurrently, someone would have to use comma-separated values in the 'Comments' or 'Groupings' field to apply this type of sub-genre tagging. It's very inflexible and annoying.\nWhy doesn't this type of tagging exist? Can it be implemented with plugins?\n\nA: It currently is not possible to add tags in iTunes like you can in other iLife applications. The only reason I can think of why its not available is that most people would just group their music by genre, and that be enough. \nOther than using the comments field or the like, there are really not many other options. In some searches I did come across an app called Qloud, but it seems to no longer exist. \n", "Q: Which were the first 500 apps on the App Store when it launched in 2008? The subject says it all. Is there somewhere a list of the first set of apps on the iPhone App Store when it went live in July 2008?\n\nA: This PinchMedia RSS feed in Wayback Machine is the best I could get so far:\nTop 100 Paid Apps as of July 21, 2008\nStill hoping I can get a full list. According to TechCrunch, there were 552 apps at the beginning, 417 paid, 135 free. If there would be a way to get top lists for all the categories, it should be possible to assemble the full list.\n\nA: The closest reference I found is this article from TechCrunch (not my favorite site, BTW!) on the top downloads after launch. Not as a comprehensive list as what you're looking for (first 500). Have you tried searching the Way Back Machine on review sites such as Macworld? You may find more articles from that original launch week and sort of compile a list of your own. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: i read from a article very recently, and thef first app presented is super monkey ball from sega.\n", "Q: How do your library folder back? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhere did the ~/Library folder go in Lion? \n\nI upgraded to Lion but now under ~/User there is no library folder.

Prior to Lion the user was running Photoshop CS4 (a Universal Binary) under Rosetta which required hitting a checkbox in the application's \"Get Info\" dialog. With the advent of Lion and the removal of Rosetta, the checkbox is gone but the OS still tries to run Photoshop as a PPC binary and fails.\nIs there a way I can reset the \"Launch this UB as a PPC binary\" flag?\n\nA: Application launch preferences are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist, including whether or not to open using Rosetta.\nOpening up this file (easier to parse if you have Property List Editor installed from the developer tools) will allow you to find the entry for the specific app that's set to open in Rosetta, and you can strip out the PPC-relevant bits. Make a back up first, just in case.\nMore info is available here.\n\nA: Try downloading http://www.xslimmer.com/ and stripping out the PowerPC code from Photoshop.  It should then default to running as Intel.\n", "Q: How to turn off automatic typing correction in Lion? Since upgrading to Lion I notice that typing is automatically getting \"corrected\".\nFor example, I type \"I posted to elance that\" and the word elance automatically changes to \"glance\".

It appears that ssh-agent is no longer functioning as expected.\nHere's a bowdlerized version of my called-from-cron script that worked great under Snow Leopard:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhoami # just to verify I'm running as myself, not root\nssh-agent # just to see what it outputs    \neval `ssh-agent`\nssh -vvv REMOTESERVER ls\n\nWhen run from the command prompt, this script works as expected.\nWhen run from cron, it doesn't work.

Running it from a standard bash prompt doesn't help the cron job out (although, oddly, it does prompt me for my passphrase ... which I would think isn't necessary b/c of the Keychain Access configuration).\nNOTE 1 - before redirecting me - I'm aware there's a similar question here (\nMac OS X Lion and sshpass) but it's specifically about a program sshpass that I don't use (although I believe that question would be answered by this one as well).\nNOTE 2 - I realize that passphrase-less SSH keys would solve my problem; however I'd prefer not to go this route.\n\nA: Adding the following code to your bash shell  script will fix the problem:\ndeclare -x SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$( find /tmp/launch-*/Listeners -user your_user -type s | head -1 )\n\nReplace your_user with your own user name.\nThis code sets the correct value for SSH_AUTH_SOCK that informs ssh or scp about how to communicate with ssh-agent when the shell script is started out of cron.\n\nA: For anyone who ends up on this page, I realized I should post the answer:\nUsing launchd instead of cron does indeed fix the authorization problem.  Your user launchd jobs (which run only when you are logged in) correctly use the SSH agent information that was unlocked via your keychain as part of login (as part of standard OS X key management, no other software required).\nTo minimize my interactions with launchd, I created a single launchd job that calls a bash script.  In this way I can simply edit the script without dealing with launchd.\nHere's the launchd file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>com.mycron.hourly</string>\n\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/Users/john/bin/cron.hourly</string>\n  </array>\n\n  <key>Nice</key>\n  <integer>1</integer>\n\n  <key>StartInterval</key>\n  <integer>3600</integer> <!-- start every X seconds -->\n\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nI saved the file to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mycron.hourly.plist, and then loaded it with:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mycron.hourly.plist\n\nOnce loaded, it will run right away and then again every 60 minutes.\nIf you follow the same procedure, you'll want to change the `ProgramArguments' string with the right path to your script.\n\nA: I would expect enhanced security like sandbox and changes to further move things to 64 bit is causing unexpected grief. \nIt's not an answer, per se, but launchd is getting all the love from apple these days. \nIt's not fixing the cron issue, but is more stable as well as more people can help with it. \n\nA: For anyone finding this now, trying to make this work in El Capitan, and still reluctant to turn your one-line cron job into a launchd script, Werner Antweiler's answer still works  but the path changed.

Initiating an ssh connection or manually running ssh-agent is enough to do it. A startup script can also be used if you want it to run automatically.

You could always check your purchase history in iTunes and your emailed receipts for purchases and compare this against the actual items in your library, but that's a lot of work.

You can set it up to make backups only at certain hours.\n\nA: You can change the sync interval - you can in this link read how to do this: http://maketecheasier.com/change-your-time-machine-backup-interval/2009/06/05\nThe link also show a 3-part Time Machine Editor.\n", "Q: MTMFS consuming an entire CPU core and fans running full bore with Lion You may be aware that Lion introduced MTMFS, the Mobile Time Machine File System.\nI've had a couple of instances now where MTMFS has been chewing up an entire core of my dual-core (mid 2009) MacBook Pro for hours on end with no evidence that it's actually doing anything constructive.\nAs a consequence, CPU temperature rises and the cooling fans run fast and noisy.\nRestarting the machine quietened things down again, but I'm expecting it to start again.\nDoes anyone understand MTMFS well enough to suggest why it's keeping itself busy (or is it most likely, simply a bug), or if there's currently any solution? I fear I may have gone deaf or been scalded to death before Apple release an update...\n\nA: Running sudo find / -type f -mmin -5 while mtmfs was using 85% of my Mac, revealed that the process was writing to /Volumes/MobileBackups/Backups.backupdb.\nI guess that TM was doing its daily local backup.\n\nA: To track down the issue you may have to dive into fs_usage or other tools that capture filesystem activity as it happens.\nNormally, I have seen minor corruption issues on a filesystem (or bugs in the code - it's hard to tell / hard to reproduce this issue) as the cause of this. In practice I can't get it to fail again after cleaning the existing local backup.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo tmutil disablelocal\n\n*reboot the Mac in safe mode (which runs fsck and many other helpful and potentially irrelevant tests and checks for corruption)\n\n*reboot the mac normally\n\n*sudo tmutil enablelocal\n\nA: I suffered this today when doing a find / -whatever -exec this-or-that {} \\;\nSuddenly mtmfs got 100% CPU. It turns out that mtmfs is a special filesystem mounted on /Volumes/MobileBackups. If you run something that will access files indiscrimately, such as a find (something many \"cleaner\" programs do) mtmfs will use a lot of CPU when its files are being accessed.\nYou have two options:\n1) As suggested, disable local Time Machine backups (sudo tmutil disablelocal)\n2) Make sure to exclude /Volumes/MobileBackups (or even /Volumes, as it can be a p.i.t.a. to run a find over network file systems) from the search command.\nThat should solve the issue.\n\nA: I've noticed this as well on my new MacBook Air. I've found turning Time Machine off and on again will stop it chewing up CPU, but don't know how to stop it happening again.\n", "Q: Is screen zoom broken in Lion? For years I've zoomed the whole Mac OS X screen with Control ⌃ + two finger scroll on the trackpad.\nIt was very useful when giving demos and when wanting to zoom in on a YouTube video.\nSince I installed Lion it was working, then it stopped working, then worked again, now it's not working.\nWhat am I doing wrong, or is it just broken?\n\nA: I experienced a similar problem in the Developer Previews of Lion.  A restart always fixed it.  \nI've not had any problems since I installed the GM public release build.\nIf you are experiencing such problems I suggest sharing feedback, and filing a bug report.\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/\nhttps://bugreport.apple.com/\n\nA: I had this problem with Leopard and it continues in Lion. The only solution that works for me is to reboot. Changing the settings in system preferences does not work on my machine.\n\nA: Several answers contradict each other, so I wanted to make another answer to pull together some of the ideas that seem (to me) to be the root behavior of zoom failures:\n\n\n*\n\n*The zoom feature that many used reliably in Snow Leopard breaks often in Lion. It generally works perfectly immediately after a reboot. A quick sleep / wake cycle after a reboot isn't the only thing needed to break this, but it appears to fail after longer periods of sleep. \n\n*When migrating from Snow Leopard to Lion - the migration is breaking the settings for people that had the zoom enabled. By \"break\" - the panel shows zoom off (or greyed out) even if it was previously on for Snow Leopard. Strangely, the system will zoom when the panel shows zoom off in this case of a migration.\n\nOnce zoom is \"broken\" a reboot will make it work again temporarily - it recovers from the failure, but doesn't prevent it from recurring again. The new zoom in window feature seems to work reliably - the window zooming will work when normal zooming is broken - you can turn that on to nudge the zooming without a reboot.\nAll of the above are \"facts\" that I've seen and reproduced on more than one Mac as well as seen more than one time on each mac that has had the problem.\n\nMy speculation is the new window zoom features (which are amazingly cool) is causing the tried and true older zoom function to have problems as the machine runs and some process crashes or some memory gets corrupted. Switching to Zoom in window or rebooting clears up this corruption or restarts whatever process needs serves the zooming temporarily.\nMy primary mac seems to fail to zoom somewhere between 8 hours into a boot and almost certainly after a day or two of use. I haven't tested a log out / log in to clear things up (yet) - but it's a near certainty it will be back within 48 hours for me to poke at it some more and see if I can see what is crashing...\nThere may be a link between using the default Control ^ key as the zoom modifier - the preference pane for choosing that modifier seems \"screwy\" to me in that it will substitute values for control when I go to look at the pane. I haven't determined if my preference file is corrupt or the system code is just mis-behaving whether or not the preference file is correct or not.\n\nA: From support.apple.com:\n\nThe OS X Lion v10.7.2 Update includes […] fixes that: […]\n\n*\n\n*Resolve an issue that causes screen zoom to stop working.\n\n\nSo the answer and the solution is, in short: update to 10.7.2, if possible.\n\nA: You now have to manually enable it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Universal Access in System Preferences\n\n*Turn on Zoom with the radio button.\n\n*Click on Options and tick Use scroll wheel with modifier keys to zoom.\n\n\nA: I adjusted the size of the \"zoom in window\" to cover the entire screen real estate; works as an adequate substitute for the big fail on screen zoom.\n\nA: My zoom, for some reason, breaks when Lion goes to sleep. To fix it I just go to universal access turn zoom off, and then back on. When its is broken the radio is on but the stuff beside it is greyed out.\n\nA: It is still broken for me in the 10.7.2, it does work very erratically…\nMy workarounds are to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use ⌥⌘+ or ⌥⌘- (instead or ctrl scroll)\n(Press ⌥⌘8 two times to reenable the zoom if the key above are not working)\n\n*Trash ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess , open Universal Access and switch the zoom option to \"ON\". This seems to be the best workaround to make everything work again (including the ctrl+scroll).\n\n\nA: I have found a solution. In Universal Access > Seeing Tab -- select Zoom in window as usual. Then, select Options > Use scroll wheel with modifier keys to zoom. If you have Enable temporary zoom... and the scroll wheel options selected... if you 'scroll out' on your mouse the zoom window will disappear once zoomed all the way out. Then, when you need it, hold command in scroll in with the wheel.\n\nA: This resolved the problem in my case\nGo to System Preferences -> Energy Saver\nand check off \n\"Automatically reduce brightness before display goes to sleep\"\nIf that doesn't work, this other solution temporary fixes the problem (so you don't have to reboot):\nSystem Preferences -> Universal Access and re-check \"Zoom in Window\"\n", "Q: Change OSX Folder Icons (Working on OSX Lion) I have a certain PNG I'd like to replace a folder icon with. \nI noticed that when i Command-I this .png file, it will preview on the bottom, but not on the top left part (generic \".png\" text appears instead).\nI also noticed that only images that DO appear on the top left side of the \"Get Info\" window can be successfully Command-C'ed + Command-V'ed into my target folders' \"Get Info\" top left area - so that the image is replaced.\nMy question: is there some kind of standard for images that makes or breaks their compatibility with changing a folder's icon? \n\nA: Any image can be used to create an icon for a folder. The problem is that you're trying to copy the image from the Finder's preview. Not all images are saved with a preview like that, so you can't always use that as a source.\nFortunately, there's a good way around that. When you copy that icon, all you're copying is the image data. You can also do that by opening any image in Preview, selecting all (cmd+a), and copying. Go to your folder's Get Info window, select that icon at the top right, and paste.\nI tested, and this works on Lion.\n", "Q: Window saver for Mac OS X Does anybody know of any software for Mac OS X which will save your program windows, so when you boot up again you can return to the same windows?  This would be a huge help since as a developer I often have 10 windows open and often have to re-open and re-size them all when I reboot.  \n\nA: The latest version of Mac OS X, Lion (10.7) has this feature bult-in. It's called Resume.\nFrom Apple: \n\nNow apps you close will reopen right where you left off, so you never have to start from scratch again. And when you install software updates, you no longer need to save your work, close your apps, and spend valuable time setting everything up again. With Resume, you can restart your Mac and return to what you were doing — with all your apps in the places where you left them.\n\nThis happens automatically. Not all apps support it yet, but those that don't should be updated soon for full support.\nMac OS X Lion costs $29, and is available on the Mac App Store.\n", "Q: Creating a quick event in iCal using LaunchBar & AppleScript what i want to figure out is how to send a String to iCal 5 on 10.7 which is interpreted the same way as creating a quick event, as if you press CMD+N with iCal in focus and then just type \"tea at 5\" into the popover.\na simplistic sketch (which doesn't work):\non handle_string(theString)\n    tell application \"iCal\"\n        make new event with theString\n    end tell\nend handle_string\n\ni'm comfortable with programming but never done anything with AppleScript.

Why is that important? Sorry about the n00b question but why is this an option? Is there any caveats to not ending a file with a line break?\n\nA: This is probably because some other users of files require  complete lines\ne.g. C code will complain if there is no newline at the end of file - see this SO question\nand one main use of Bbedit etc is programming\nSo the reason is not really specific to the Apple editors mentioned but more for what use the files is made of.\nAlso see the comment to that question \n\nNot really the reason, but it's very annoying if you cat a file and it does not have a trailing newline as the new shell prompt will appear after the last line of the file (i.e. not in column 0)\n\n", "Q: Xcode 4.1 stuck trying to load debug symbols from iPhone 3G I submitted the following as a Xcode bug report, but I'm post it here in case somebody is experiencing the same problem and can shed more light into the matter.\nI use two devices for development: my iPhone 3GS, and a friend's iPhone 3G running 4.2.1/8C148. I could debug with both of these devices using Snow Leopard and Xcode 4.0.2.\nI recently upgraded to Mac OS X Lion 10.7/11A511. I uninstalled the whole developer tools by using 'sudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools –mode=all' and I installed Xcode 4.1/4B110 using the Mac App Store. I've been happily coding with my iPhone 3GS, but I won't longer work with the iPhone 3G.\nWhen I connect the 3G, Xcode 4.1 asks for collection of the debug symbols. If I accept, it starts copying the files, but it gets stuck at roughly 80% of the process (see the attached screenshot #1 for the Organizer screen). If I look in the Activity Monitor I can see the DTDKSymbolHelper process eating up all the resources (see attached screenshot #2).\nIf I force kill DTDKSymbolHelper, Xcode will finish collecting the debug symbols and will believe that my 3G is ready for use. However, when I try to run my app on the 3G, the app copies successfully and it is run, but then the console shows several errors (see attached txt file), and the app gets stuck at the Default screen. The DTDKSymbolHelper process is spawned again, and it perpetually eats all the resources again.\nIf I exit the App via the home button and disconnect my iPhone 3G from the Mac, I can launch the app again and it runs perfectly, updated to the latest version.\nIf I connect my 3G to the Mac again, Xcode will ask again for collecting the debug symbols, and if I accept, it gets stuck at the same place.\nI acknowledge that the most sensible thing would be to restore the phone in order to see if that fixes the problem, but I wanted to try and get to the bottom of the problem first.\nIn my Macbook Pro + iPhone 3GS this problem is 100 % reproducible, so please ask for any piece of information that you need.\nExpected Results\nXcode 4.1 ether successfully finishes collecting device debug symbols, or it shows an appropriate error message.\nActual Results\nXcode 4.1 gets stuck indefinitely, with process DTDKSymbolHelper eating up all the system resources.\n\nA: In case anybody is still interested, this issue changed slightly with Xcode 4.2, and I posted an updated question here: \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7922308/xcode-4-2-error-0xc002-when-trying-to-use-a-jailbroken-iphone-3g-for-developmen\n", "Q: Is there a sexier alternative to the status bar in Safari?

Extremely configurable with a similar extension ecosystem as Firefox.\n\n*Microsoft Outlook - A very fully featured email and calendar package. It replaces Microsoft's previous Mac email client, Entourage.\n\n*Sparrow - A unique email application. The layout encourages casual, Twitter-like conversation by evoking the timeline view of popular Twitter apps. It's pretty trendy at time of writing.\n\n*Mailplane - Basically an optimised, dedicated Gmail browser window. Worth looking into if you're a heavy Gmail webmail user.\n\n*MailMate - I hadn't heard of this one before, but it has a good review at Lifehacker.\n\n\nA: Try Sparrow, you can try the free version and if you like it, buy it.\n", "Q: Xcode 4.1 not downloading - Lion I am trying to download Xcode 4.1 from the Mac App Store (I am on Lion, and I have Xcode 3 installed).

I would like to purchase Lion, but the Mac App Store requires a credit card, and I don't have one. Are there any other options which don't require a credit card?\n\nA: Just to note, you can (at least in the UK) use the App Store with a debit card.\nHowever, if you don't have one of those either, and you're not having any issues with OSX 10.6, why not continue using it for now? In August, Apple will start selling 10.7 on a USB drive, which you can purchase with cash in an Apple Store.\n\nA: As someone already answered, you could wait till August and buy Lion in a USB Flash Drive, but that will cost you $30 more, besides the wait.\nYou could buy iTunes Gift Cards to put some credit in your iTunes Store account (and even open an account using using an iTunes Gift Card as the payment method). If you don't have a place nearby where to buy them, you can buy through eBay and pay with PayPal using your debit card.\nSome vendor will send the iTunes Gift Card in a matter of minutes, through e-mail, and don't charge much more than in a store.\n\nA: At least here in Finland they accept ClickAndBuy, which in turn accepts some debit cards (like Visa Electron). You can also add funds to the account with a bank transfer.\n\nA: I used a prepaid MasterCard; you go to your local bank & you buy one, they come in denominations of €50,75,100 (or your countries equivalent). They work similarly to cellphone top-up card (for prepaid contract obviously)\n\nA: lpacheco has the simplest solution, buy a gift card, you can get these everywhere from bookstores to supermarkets etc.  Create an iTunes account if you don't already have one, and load the credit up.\n", "Q: Should I be concerned about graphics switching for battery life? I have a 15-inch MBP, Mid-2010, 2.66GHz i7, with Intel integrated graphics and a discrete NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M. Since I installed Lion, it seems my battery life has gone down to just 2 or 3 hours. After reading various things on the internet, I found out about the gfxCardStatus app which I used and noticed my machine is using the discrete graphics card. It appears the following apps are requiring discrete graphics:\n\n\n*\n\n*the Google Talk plugin (because I keep gmail.com open, even though I'm not signed in to chat)\n\n*Twitter for Mac\n\n*both Droplr and CloudApp\n\n\nShould I be concerned about these? Will it affect my battery life if my machine switches to discrete graphics even though these apps may not actively be using it?\n\nAnd, as a follow-up: is resetting the SMC (another thing I read people have been trying) a good thing to try to improve my battery life?\n\nA: Absolutely ! http://codekrieger.com/gfxCardStatus allows you to lock your graphics card to use only the Intel integrated graphics. It makes a big difference when you need to squeeze every last hour out your battery.\nThe other thing that helps if you have a ton of startup items for everyday use is to hold down shift when you log in, so there are not extraneous processed running in the background.\nAnd also keep the screen brightness at the minimum acceptable level.\nThis way I can get 9 hours out of my 17 macbook.\n", "Q: Possible to install VM in another VM?

They only pointed to the CUPS configuration file (/etc/cups/cupsd.conf), but I do not know the right setting there for printing to remote queues. Also, the web interface running on localhost:631 couldn’t help me… Any ideas?\n\nA: The release notes for CUPS 1.5 mention that\n\nCUPS no longer supports the old ~/.cupsrc or ~/.lpoptions files from\n  CUPS 1.1.x. The ~/.cups/client.conf and ~/.cups/lpoptions files that\n  were introduced in CUPS 1.2 must now be used.\n\nHave you tried putting the line\nServerName print-server\n\ninto ~/.cups/client.conf?\n\nA: Set up /etc/cups/client.conf correctly for your environment so that the cups printers display in the print config dialog.\nTo get the queues to display in the applications as a choice, make each printer the default printer once.  Distribute the resulting com.apple.print.favorites.plist to users with mcx or copy to ~/Library/Preferences \nIt uses the PPDs on the server.  No client config necessary!\n\nA: This is an old question, but I just face the same problem without finding any quick solution.\nCUPS documentation indicates that the use of ServerName \"does not work on OS X 10.7 or later because sandboxed applications do not always have direct network access.\" :'(\nOne possible workaround is to use the terminal and send the jobs to the server using the lp/lpstat command. You must specify the server with the option -h.

I didn't see what it did, I was out.   \nNow if I check in Software Purchases, it doesn't show anything. How do I check if I am running Lion for real? About page says I am running 10.7!!\n\nA: What you can do is to check if you are running the right build. It's just to check that you are not still running the developer preview.

After upgrading to Lion my Magic Mouse's level indicator seems to be broken.\nFor the whole week it was reporting solid 100% on a pair of used batteries that were about 65% before upgrading.

When I'm on the move I want to tether to my phone to access a few essentials (telnet, ssh, IM, a few low bandwidth websites).  What I don't want is for a load of background processes like Software Update or Google Software Updater to start downloading gigs of patches over the phone's 3G connection.  \nIs there a way to set up a temporary white list of hosts to which my machine can connect and deny access to anything else?  NOTE: This must be temporary only, I obviously want full internet access when connected via a wifi/wired connection.  \n\nA: Little Snitch could help you out here. It's very configurable outbound firewall for Macs. The rule set it supports is comprehensive and you can block based on interface as well as IP ranges. You could set it up with everything blocked, tether, let through just the apps you want, and then enable/disable Little Snitch with this ruleset based on how you're using your Mac at any particular point in time.\n\nA: I'm not sure how you could whitelist certain hosts, but you could quickly blacklists host by adding the Software Update domainnames to point back to your localhost. You can do this by editing /etc/hosts or by using a tool like ghost.\nghost add gs.apple.com\n\n", "Q: Should I buy a trackpad? I've never really been a huge fan of trackpads but after playing with the official Apple Magic Trackpad using Lion, I have to admit, I loved the full screen swiping and using two fingers to swipe Chrome web pages.\nI'm a programmer by trade and do VERY minimal art work using Pixelmator.\nWhat are your impressions of using Apple's multitouch trackpads?\n\nA: I have both the Magic Trackpad and the Magic Mouse, and IMO the trackpad works really well for browsing, navigating in the general system, and is a very natural way to interact with the computer.\nThat being said, it is not precise enough to be used when you need to do \nphoto/video editing, and in those rare occasions I use the mouse.\nI also do programming, but barely use the mouse/trackpad when I'm coding.\nPros: \n\n\n*\n\n*Very easy to navigate in pages (Web browsing, preview, etc.)\n\n*Enable one to use the built-in gestures, and that make a huge difference in day-to-day computer usage\n\n*Ideal for an \"HTPC\" usage of your Mac : I frequently casually use my Mac from the couch, and not having to move a mouse is a definitive plus.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Precision\n\n*Doesn't fully replace a mouse\n\n*You'll miss the gestures as soon as you'll use a different computer.\n\n\nA: As a web developer as well I use the Magic Mouse and get almost all the functionality (gestures) in Lion with the benefits of precision when I need it. I used the Magic Trackpad for a while (borrowed from a friend) and it didn't work as well for me compared to the Magic Mouse.\n\nA: I've got one recently. So far the only thing I am happy about is that my employer paid for it. If I put it right next to my wireless keyboard, it is constantly picking up accidental brushes of my fingers when I am fumbling for the arrow, return, or delete keys. \nProbably this will change as I learn not to be careless around it. It is nice to have access to all the gestures supported in Lion, but I don't think I will be giving up my mouse even if I get used to the Magic Trackpad. One big reason is that the force required to register a click is far more than on most mice and specifically on my Logitech MX1000.\n\nA: As a counterpoint to many of the answers already posted, I find Apple's multitouch trackpads essential to my use of a computer. I've never particularly liked using mice, but I could never tell why until I used a trackpad for the first time on my iBook G4. Since then (and especially with the increase in gesture support over the years), I've gone all-trackpad all the time. \nI find trackpads to be, in general and in my usage, to be much more precise than mice: I find delicate operations in Photoshop much easier to perform and I find hitting small buttons in interfaces to be much easier. (This is probably because I have better fine motor control in my fingers than in my wrist and arm. I generally operate a mouse using the muscles in my upper arm such that my elbow moves along with the mouse.)\nI use the multitouch gestures all the time, particularly two-finger scroll and right click, three-finger-drag, the various four-finger swipes, and the five-finger pinches. I don't use tap-to-click or back/forward gestures because I frequently accidentally trigger them.\n", "Q: Can I use the same Lion OS X license on a home and a work machine, or do I have to buy one for each? I bought a Lion OS X license for my home Mac. Can I use this same license to install Lion on my work computer?\nThe Can I use the new Lion OS X license on two machines, or do I have to buy one for each? question is similar, but that question is about installing on two home machines. My doubt is caused by this excerpt from the App Store license (emphasis mine):\n\n(i) to download, install, use and run for personal, non-commercial use [...]\n\nIf the moderators feel it's more appropriate to complement that question instead of opening a new one, please say so.\n\nA: Since you purchase it from the Mac app store the licensing is the same as other Mac App store purchases. I can't find the exact resource but I believe you can install it on up to 5 Macs.\nHere is an article with some information about licensing in Lion. http://osxdaily.com/2011/06/07/single-purchase-of-lion-installs-on-all-macs/\nUpdate: I found some clear language from Apple's Lion press release\n\nThe Lion upgrade can be installed on all your authorized personal Macs\n\n\nA: I believe if you want to follow the letter of the EULA you will need to buy it twice.\nWith respect to installing a single purchase of Lion on multiple machines, your options are: all the machines you personally own or all the machines that your employer owns and you exclusively use.[1] \nFrom the Lion EULA:\n\n\n*\n\n*install for personal, non-commercial use... on each Apple-branded computer...that you own or control; \n\n*If you are a commercial enterprise or educational institution, to download, install, use, and run one (1) copy of the Apple Software for use either: (a) by a single individual on each of the Mac Computer(s) that you own or control\n\n\nBasically all machines that are your property you can install it on.  If you'd take your work computer home if you got fired then you only need one license, otherwise two.\n[1] - there is also some provision for machines used by multiple people.\n\nA: Please refer my answer here for your question: \n\nCan I use the new Lion OS X license on two machines, or do I have to buy one for each?\n\n", "Q: How can I listen to a voice memo in background like iPod and open some other note taking app on iPhone 4? I tried, but my voice memo gets paused. If this isn't possible, is there any way to import voice memos to ipod (kind of workaround)?\n\nA: Since Voice Memos both plays and records audio, and recording can't be done in the background as far as I know, then the whole app does not work in the background. That sounds more like a design decision to me, rather than a technical limitation. In theory, Apple could have made the playing audio part of Voice Memos to work in the background. \nA very long-winded way to get to do what you need is to import the voice memos to your iTunes library. In iTunes, select your iPhone from the Devices list. One of the tabs (probably Music or Info) has a checkbox that will enable transferring voice memos into iTunes. When this is enabled and you sync your device, the voice memos get imported and a playlist titled \"Voice Memos\" is created. \nAt this point, those audio files and the \"Voice Memos\" playlist should act like any other. You could, for instance, get to the audio files from the \"Voice Memos\" playlist and then set the metadata for each file by right-clicking it and selecting the Get Info dialog. Useful voice memos can be set to a Media Type of Audiobook--which makes them available to you as audiobooks in the iPod app.\nIf you make them Audiobooks or basically do anything that sends them to the iPod app; then you could play them in the background while you open your note-taking app of choice. \nYou do not need to set them as audiobooks, though. Once they're in the voice memos playlist; then  you can sync the playlist as you would any other. The caveat is that without metadata, it becomes hard to find the files in the iPod app. In iTunes, for instance, they show either with a blank artist name or with an artist name of \"Untitled\". That is why I strongly suggest adding metadata ASAP.\nI am just reminded of Dragon Naturally Speaking and Dragon Dictate. I do not have them, but I have heard nothing but great things about them. You may try their apps (one of them is free, I believe). They may offer you better features over the included Voice Memos app. I've seen screenshots where it looks like in addition to having a record option, the UI also has a text field for you to type on. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: There is one way, and it only works on IOS 5 (or higher - you need to see the camera button when you press twice the home button when the iphone is locked).\nTo be able to listen to your voice memos while doing something else, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the recording.  \n\n*Lock the screen (without pressing anything else) - this way your recording continues to play.  \n\n*Double press the home button. (the camera icon will appear on bottom right)  \n\n*Open the camera.  \n\n*Press the home button - and now you can do anything while the memo continues playing. \n\n\nHope this helps. All the best!\n\nA: So hours and hour later i have worked out how to listen to my voice memos in iTunes app on my iPhone 5 - i managed to sync them from the voice memos app to my itunes library on my mac but then could not get them back onto my phone to be able to listen to them.\nOnce you have them in your iTunes library they will appear in a 'Voice Memos' folder\n\n\n*\n\n*copy the songs into a new playlist\n\n*select all the files that you want to sync\n\n*right click on them and go to 'go info'\n\n*on the options tab change the media kind from voice memo to music\n\n*plug phone back in and resync.\n\n\nThis got all my voice memos to appear like songs in a separate playlist under the itunes app.\nFinally :)\n\nA: Christian,\nyour suggestion doesn't work anymore since iPhone update to v4.2.1. The \"voice memo\" playlist appears in iTunes on the computer but doesn't appear in the phone (unless you search for it) and voice memos are not synchronised anyway.\nThe only solution is to sync the memo from the iPhone to the computer, select the voice memo you want on your phone, go to “Advanced” and select “Create MP3 Version”. Then put that mp3 version in the playlist of your choice and voilà!\nPS: you can use the same trick with podcasts episodes if you want to keep some of them when the original podcast episodes get deleted.\nPPS: be aware that copying the physical file and adding the copy to iTunes doesn't work neither for podcasts nor memos, you have to alter the file if you want the get the copy added in your iPhone music app and prevent it from being deleted if you get rid of the original.\nRS\n\nA: *\n\n*Share the voice mail to your email which is linked to your iPhone. It will change it to an m4a. \n\n*Open the file from your email.\n\n*Press play.\n\n*Press the home button. The memo will continue playing.\n\n\nA: Basically it's already been said, though it's a bit different in iOS 6 & iOS 7:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Voice Memos.\n\n*Start listening to one of your recordings.\n\n*Lock your iPhone.\n\n*Wake your iPhone, and stay on the lock screen.\n\n*Slide up on the camera, but don't take a picture.\n\n*Press the home button.\n\n\nSource: Snapguide: How to Listen to a Voice Memo in the Background (iPhone)\n\nA: Copy the record and paste it to your note. Then you can play  it from notes.\n\nA: If you are texting someone, on text free for your iPod, go to your voice memos, select the memo you want and then not completely turn it off but just push the button and when that person texts you back it will show up on your screen then, when you unlock your iPod, it will go straight to text free, then from there you can push the home button and the voice memo will still be playing. I know it's complicated but it works for me. If you need more explanation, just ask. \n\nA: *\n\n*Open voice memos\n\n*Play the memo you want\n\n*Double click home button (while playing)\n\n*Click on any other open app and instantaneously hit the         lock button. \n\n*Open phone and you can navigate your phone while it continues playing \n\n\nA: Hit the sharing icon and tap copy. \nThen open up your notes and paste it on a note.  Now you can use other apps and run in background.  Or even write lyrics to you track.  ;) \n\nA: Start the recording and then lock the screen. Swipe up on the home screen and hold on the notepad. An option will show up say create new note or something to that effect. Before it opens, lock the screen again.

This isn't a developed solution (yet), but I'd suggest some well-placed edits to this nib might be able to disable the dialog, perhaps by making buttons disappear. At any rate, this sounds more promising than randomly zeroing out portions of the binary using a hex-editor, which is the other channel I've been exploring.\n\nA: Copy and paste this line into Terminal\n\nsudo chmod 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/SecurityAgentPlugins/FamilyControls.bundle/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/localizable.strings\n\nNote that should be allllll one line!\nThen try again and see what happens.\nSorry!

For some reason, I cannot convince the app store that an application (Xcode, in this case) is not installed.\nI have deleted /Developer (which only contained an old, busted Xcode 3.2.3) and tried to rebuild the LaunchServices DB (using lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user) but to no avail; The app store stubbornly claims that Xcode is already installed.\nI'm at my wit's end, here.\n\nA: For Xcode, try to go to /Applications and move \"Install Xcode\" to trash.\nI think Xcode is a special case, it doesn't get deleted when you delete it form launchpad.\n\nA: First, you can try to remove all remaining traces of the old program. Search your whole hard drive (including all partitions and accounts), and attached external drives for related files and remove them.\nIf you can't get the App Store to believe that you don't have the app anymore, hold down option and click on the Install button. That will let you download it, and the installer will probably work.\n\nA: This probably indicates that you have a cracked application on your computer.  Within the package of each application there is a folder called /Contents/_MASReceipt.  This is the Mac App Store Receipt file.  A common way for people to crack Mac App store applications is to replace the receipt folder with the receipt of another program that you have legitimately purchased or installed with your Apple ID.  Since the receipt for XCode exists within some other application that is not Xcode, you will always see the update until you either install the latest version of Xcode or remove the application (that is not Xcode) that includes the Xcode receipt. \n", "Q: What does \"mds: (Error) Volume: Could not find requested backup type:2 for volume \" signify?

After that, it works again but the problem reappears after a reboot.\nI've had this machine for about 2 years now, haven't had this issue until I installed Lion (first the GM release and now the version from the App store) so this feels like a software issue. I didn't upgrade to Lion but did a clean install and I've tried it with another user account as well, same issue.\nAny suggestions?\n\n\n\nA: If you are seeing the greyed out output volume when no headphones or plug is physically present than the physical switch to detect a plug missed the unplug event.\nThe system things you still have speakers connected and is routing the information to the jack.\nCheck for lint with a magnifying glass or very gently blow some clean compressed air. Service might be an option if this is something that happens very often.\nResponding to the comments about this happening each time at reboot, that would indicate that the hardware is somehow saving headphones on as a default setting or the hardware is mis reading things at boot. Resetting NVRAM might help if it's a saved setting issue.\nThere are only 3 things in play here:\n\n\n*\n\n*The physical package in the jack that is responsible for sensing if anything is inserted and telling if it's a metal jack or an optical jack.\n\n*The brains of the hardware - storing settings in NVRAM and turning the physical sensor into something the software can show you on the screen.\n\n*The OS - Lion or Snow Leopard\n\n\nI would be very surprised it's Lion related - but I've seen strange things before where software doesn't make the correct read on a sensor. It's good you can restore things temporarily by plugging / unplugging a jack. If you took it to a repair shop, they would hopefully test your mac with Snow Leopard again to rule out lion before doing an actual repair on the jack or the hardware. If this is something you can depend on - it happens each and every time, you might test by booting from a backup or installing Snow Leopard onto a USB drive and testing. It sure sounds like an odd but reproducible thing you have happening to your mac.\n\nA: This problem is related to shutdown. If you shutdown with headphones connected and restart without them you'll have this issue on some hardware. \nEntering a headphone will enable audio (through headphone off course) removing it again will disable the output again. Only a reboot without a jack connected will reenable normal audio output\n", "Q: Is there a way to get the date of the first boot of an old mac?

I'd suggest picking up a DVD of Snow Leopard and then update normally to Lion through the App Store.\n\nA: I have Mac and iOS developer accounts. Here is my best shot…\n\n\n*\n\n*There are different development programs. Mac OS X (Macs), iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod), and Safari. Each one requires registration and Mac and iOS require $99 each if you want to sell apps in the App Store. The link you provided has a link that will get you started but this link (http://developer.apple.com/programs/start/standard/) is the actual registration link.\n\n*If you register and pay the $99 annual fee for the Mac developer program then you can download Snow Leopard (10.6) or Lion (10.7). Snow Leopard will be a big download you'll need to burn to a DVD or create a bootable drive to install. Lion gives you a promo code for the Mac App store which requires Snow Leopard (10.6.7?).\n\n*You'll need to upgrade to Snow Leopard before upgrading to Lion. If you are still on Leopard you'll need to make sure your machine is capable of running Lion.\n\n*Yes. See above.\n\n\nA: There are two different paid developer programs: one for OS X and one for iOS. Each cost $99 and give you access to the latest and beta OSes for the platform for the program you've purchased (i.e., as of July 2011, the Mac Developer Program gives you access to Lion; iOS Developer Program gives you access to iOS 4.3 and iOS 5 beta).\nYou can register for the developer programs using Leopard, but Xcode 3.2 and 4.0 require Snow Leopard, and app submission requires either of those versions of Xcode.\nRather than registering for the Mac Developer Program, you should just buy a copy of Snow Leopard (and optionally Lion) and develop and submit your iOS app using Xcode 3.2/4.0.\n", "Q: how do I access iTunes Visualizer options?

I'm trying to decide whether to get Lion or Lion Server. I'm not too worried about the $20 premium or the extra disk space used, but I'd rather not make things more complex to work with and manage, nor do I want my laptop to run slower as a result of having the Server version.\nI'm not sure if I will use any of the Server specific apps in the long run, but I'm certainly curious to try them out. I just want to make sure that I can disable those services/features I don't use and that in other respects Lion Server really is just Lion + extra features.\n\nA: Actually you have to have Lion to get Lion server which means that the cost is really $30 + $50. Server configures your computer to host wikis and mail server. It really isn't meant for day to day consumer uses. I wouldn't recommend it. \nIf you want to try Lion server I recommend installing it in a Virtual Machine (VMWare, Parallels, VirtualBox) and playing with it that way.\n", "Q: Will Lion download from Mac App Store resume if network connection interrupted? I'm contemplating downloading it but I'm in an area prone to connectivity outages. Or does it install a pre-loader which then downloads the actual disk image (which I can curl)?\n\nA: App applications downloaded from the App Store will automatically resume if your network service is interrupted. The Lion download is a DVD sized .dmg file that contains the OS, not a pre-loader.\nIf your download does get interrupted you can control + click on the Lion icon in your dock then click resume. \n", "Q: How should I set up the firewall and DHCP with an AirPort Extreme and Lion Server? I'm trying to set up a network using an AirPort Extreme as a router (connected to the WAN on one end and the LAN on the other). I understand that out of the box I will have a hardware firewall, and the ability to set up DHCP, but am unclear on what the best way to add the capabilities of Lion Server, or if there's even any advantage to doing so.\nSpecifically,\n(1) I'd like to use Lion Server, rather than the AirPort Extreme for DHCP, mostly because the UI is much easier to use and provides finer control.\n(2) I wonder if there's any reason to use Lion Server as the firewall, instead of or in addition to AirPort Extreme (or if that even makes sense).\nIs there a best practice on how to set this up? Any suggestions on how to proceed would be appreciated.\n\nA: To use the Lion server for DHCP, you need to simply turn off DHCP service on the AirPort Extreme and turn it on in Lion.\nTo use the Lion box as a firewall it will need to have two network ports - one for LAN and one for WAN. (Unless you want your LAN side to be provided wirelessly (which I don't recommend)).\nI'm a big fan of OSX server and use it at home myself... so here are some other neat things you could do with a Lion server...\nSet up your Lion server to provide DNS names and a domain. When using the Lion server to provide IP addresses (DHCP), you can also allow it to provide other info to the clients, like who's providing DNS. So rather than having to use IPs to refer to your machines, you can give them DNS names. This means you don't have to set up static IPs for each device and you don't have to remember IPs! DNS and domain name examples: macbook.mynetwork.net, airport.mynetwork.net, etc. (mynetwork.net being your domain)\nSet up RADIUS authentication with WPA2 Enterprise for your wireless connection. You \"pair\" the AirPort Extreme with the Lion server. This means that people who want to use your WiFi have to log in with a user and password. The user authentication is handled by the Lion server - set up your users in the server's directory.\nSet up your Lion server to provide software updates to your Macs This means that your server downloads all the updates from Apple and can then serve them to Macs on your network. Saving bandwidth and time (it's alot faster!) You'll need to either manually point the client Macs to the server for their updates or \"bind\" the Macs to the server in order to change the appropriate settings for this (which is a big topic best discussed elsewhere).\nHave fun.\n\nA: I'll bet you figure it out already now, but here's a solution I made here :\n\n\n*\n\n*ADSL modem in BRIDGE mode\n\n*AEBS in 'share public IP'-mode so is acts as hardware firewall, router,\nNAT ... blabla (10.0.0.1)\nfor NAT leave standard host open and NAT-PMP on\n\n*TCP/IP (internet side) DHCP and fill in as first DNS server to 10.0.0.2\n(your own server)\n\n*Set DHCP as follow : DHCP start 10.0.0.2 DHCP end 10.0.0.3\n\n*Lease 1 day\n\n*DHCP reserve : 10.0.0.2 --> server (with real MAC address and server\nconfigured as static 10.0.0.2)\n\n*DHCP reserve : 10.0.0.3 --> BOGUS (with FAKE MAC address 00:00:00:00:00:01)\n\n*DHCP at the server with\nRange  10.0.0.2 to 10.0.0.254\nRouter 10.0.0.1\nDNS-server 10.0.0.2\n\n\nAnd your combination AEBS / OSX Server works fine together and dealing\nDHCP / DNS / Firewall (just in case) / etc etc ...\n\nA: There is no way to \"simply\" turn off DHCP on an Airport Extreme. The only way is to use Bridge mode, but then you lose the NAT. As a workaround, you can add a fake MAC to a reserved IP address. If you plan on using Guest networking, you'll need to do one for each simultaneous guest, because the DHCP ranges are tied together.\nIt's probably the worst part of the AEBS feature set.\n", "Q: What product is used in OSX to edit word or openoffice documents and also works with PDF? I want to be able to copy portions of PDF file and paste into another document like MS Word format document. The important thing is that any portion that is copied must preserver original formatting fonts etc. when it is pasted into my document. So what product is out there on the writing side and what product is out there on the PDF side?\n\nA: Preserving the layout and appearance from text in a PDF when copying it to anther text processing tool is almost an impossible task, both on OSX and Windows.\nI'd suggest two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Export to .rtf. In Windows using Acrobat Professional you can export as .rtf, which can be opened by Microsoft Word (among others) and is (sometimes) a close approximation of the layout and still allows for editing the text.\nOn OSX there appears to be tools that allows exporting to .rtf as well, like this one: File Juicer (never actually tried or used it). You can then open the .rtf file using Word, OpenOffice, etc.\n\n*screenshot - However, if post-editing text is not of your concerns, I'd go for a screenshot from the PDF that you paste into whatever editor you are using.\n\nA: To edit Word Documents you usually use Microsoft Word.\nPages, LibreOffice and OpenOffice can open them too with some minor compatibility issues.\nTo edit OpenOffice Documents you can use OpenOffice or LibreOffice.\nANd forr editing PDF files couldnt you even use Preview for that.\nAt least that is what this article says: link\ni hope this helps, if you have any other concerns tell me\n\nA: Copying and pasting text from a PDF in Apple Preview, and then pasting it into another document, works well under some circumstances. It generally works better than trying the same thing in Adobe Reader X.\n\nA: For editing and modifying PDFs, Apple Preview has some functions for that, but if you want to do much more, try Smile Software's PDFPen and PDFPenPro.\n\nA: NeoOffice is a shareware \"fork\" of OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice that is custom-tailored to the Mac user interface and better integrated with Mac OS X than either OpenOffice or LibreOffice. Of course it also makes PDFs and works with OpenDocument format (.odt). I highly recommend NeoOffice. I have been using it and making donations to support its development for the last seven years.\n", "Q: How do I change the default Space for an app in Mission Control? Under Snow Leopard and Spaces you could define which Space an app should automatically launch in, including the ability to indicate that it should be visible in every space.\nMy apps are respecting the settings I applied before upgrading to Lion -- for example, iChat, QuickTime Player, and my Billings time tracker show up in all Spaces, Chrome always launches in space 2, etc. -- but there no longer seems to be any way to modify them or add these kinds of defaults for new apps.\nIs there any way to make these assignments with Mission Control?\n\nA: You can do this from the dock.\nSwitch to the space you want to pin your app to, then access the options menu from its dock icon:\n\n\nA: Right-click (control+click) on the dock icon, Options > Assign To\n\nA: No longer possible with System Preferences\nIt seems impossible to use Mission Control or any other Apple-provided preference pane to change application—space bindings, or present an overview of bindings. \nUsing Terminal to view or change bindings\nAn overview of application—space bindings\nCommand: \ndefaults read com.apple.spaces\nWhere an application is listed without the UUID of a desktop space, this seems to mean desktop 1. \n(I guess that the permanent desktop requires no UUID.)\nExample\n[macbookpro08-centrim:~] gjp22% defaults read com.apple.spaces\n{\n    \"app-bindings\" =     {\n        \"com.apple.preview\" = \"7EA54FE0-EB71-444A-8075-C6A2D7000305\";\n        \"com.apple.safari\" = AllSpaces;\n        \"com.barebones.textwrangler\" = \"\";\n    };\n    spaces =     (\n                {\n            type = 0;\n            uuid = \"7EA54FE0-EB71-444A-8075-C6A2D7000305\";\n        },\n                {\n            type = 0;\n            uuid = \"CD0AFD50-7902-41EC-A4C4-C313B04CD2BB\";\n        }\n    );\n}\n\nConsidering the arrays in that example, I would not attempt to change or delete individual items within an array using Terminal alone.

I don't know where. \nDock menus accessibility\nMy experience of VoiceOver with Dock is that whilst Dock menus are accessible, the routine for changing a binding would be not particularly user-friendly. \nAlternatives\nThere's scope for a third party developer to write an application, maybe a preference pane, for easier overview/management of bindings. \n", "Q: Does \"Secure Empty Trash\" securely delete the hidden version files for documents in the Trash in OS X Lion? The new Versions feature in Lion creates hidden files that store old versions of the document you're working on in case you want to revert back to some older version of the document. If I drag a document to the Trash, then select Secure Empty Trash from the Finder menu, do the hidden version files get securely deleted along with the document?\n\nA: I just tested this out, and it appears that the older files do indeed get deleted. It did not matter if I chose Secure Empty Trash or simply emptied the trash normally, they were also deleted.\nA little more detail:\nTo test this, I enabled the root user to allow me to peer into /.DocumentRevisions-V100 and the files within. The exact structure of this folder and its contents are better explained over in John Siracusa's Lion review (Internals, Document Revisions).\nI created a couple files, then made some changes, saving new versions. The folder that contained the revisions populated with new files as I saved new versions. Within this top level folder, there's a folder called PerUID, which houses subfolders for each user account. Each user account folder contains a series of numbered folders, one folder for each file that has revisions saved. Thus, the actual revisions are saved as files a few levels down in this hierarchy, with hashed filenames. Emptying the trash (either way) would delete these files, but the preceding folder structure would remain in place.\nBefore deleting:\n/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/0/5/com.apple.revisions\nThis folder still has the previous versions contained within.\nAfter deleting:\n/.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/0/5/com.apple.revisions\nThis folder still exists, but it is empty.\nI did not inspect the other folders within /.DocumentRevisions-V100/, so I did not check the databases that are contained within them. Siracusa goes into more detail, but they seem to exist to contain databases to track changes and map the user's files to the revisions saved by the system. I'm fairly certain that no document contents are saved there, though I'm not sure about filenames, and if filenames are present, if they're hashed or not.\n\nA: My guess is no, but this is not a definitive answer.\nI first created a very large (~160 MB) .txt file, and made changes to the file in TextEdit. As expected, that file and its versions showed up in /.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID. The files appeared to be ~160 MB to ls, but according to du -h they used 0B on disk. The hard link count for each file was 1. A folder called .cs (chunk storage) under /.DocumentRevisions-V100 had grown by about 110 MB.\nEvery time I changed the file, the following happened in /.DocumentRevisions-V100:\n\n\n*\n\n*A ~160 MB file was created in /.DocumentRevisions-V100/staging/. The hard link count for this file is 1.\n\n*That file appeared to move to /.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/<UID>/<#>/com.apple.documentVersions. The hard link count remained 1.\n\n*That ~160 MB file became 0B, and the size of /.DocumentRevisions-V100/.cs grew by about 2 MB.\n\n\nThe free space of the drive (df) was consistent with what du told me. Free space would go down significantly, and then return to nearly what it was before saving a new version.\nNext, I tried to shred the file with Secure Empty Trash. OS X seems to use a program called Locum to securely delete the file. Attaching fs_usage to Locum shows an awful lot of reads and writes to the original .txt file. While Locum is doing its thing, all the versions under /.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID can still be accessed with data intact. After Locum is done writing over the data, it unlinks the original .txt file, and the versions in /.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID suddenly disappear. Locum then moves on to anything else in the Trash, while never touching /.DocumentRevisions-V100.\nWhatever is in /.DocumentRevisions-V100 is not being securely erased.\nEDIT: I should add that whatever is in /.DocumentRevisions-V100 is somehow obfuscated or compressed (the folder was only ~120 MB). I haven’t yet read the versions or filesystem sections of Siracusa’s review… maybe there are clues in there.\n", "Q: Does iChat screen sharing over the internet work in OS X Lion? If I upgrade to Lion, will I still be able to use iChat to take over my elderly father's Mac (we have MobileMe accounts) to help him with problems and software updates?

This use case is a bit niche, so I'm not sure if this is something on my end, or an undocumented change. I'm throwing this out there to see if anybody else can help test and report back.\nI have a dual monitor setup. Both monitors are set to the same resolution, 1920 × 1200 I have them arranged so that my primary display is on the right, and the desktop extends to the left, like this:\n\nIn previous versions of OS X (at least Snow Leopard, possibly earlier), moving the cursor to the Apple menu with enough force would 'stick' it in that corner for a brief moment instead of immediately moving to the next display over. This was done, I believe, to preserve the ability to throw the cursor in the corner without needing to aim to hit a specific target. If you slowed down, you could easily move back and forth without hitting this little snag, and the cursor would keep moving if you kept moving the mouse, so it was an extra little exception case that had to be programmed in.\nAfter upgrading to Lion, this no longer seems to work. I've not changed any settings, and disabled any third party tweaks that might interfere. Still, it seems weird that such a strange edge case would be specifically removed, so I'm wondering if anybody else can confirm/reproduce this behavior? If you've got dual displays and wouldn't mind testing it out real quick and reporting back whether it works or not and what OS you're on, that will help narrow down what's going on.\nAs a side note, I know that I can rearrange the displays in the Arrangement tab to have the left one 'sit' a bit lower, which will give me a corner to aim for, but this is non-ideal since then windows will look pretty funky when they span it, as I don't want to have to physically re-arrange the screens.\nIn addition to testing this out, if anybody has a link/source that documents this behavior for either OS, I'd appreciate it.\n\nA: Here's another bit of wonky screen edge behavior in Lion.\nWhen you activate Mission Control, your screen edges are suddenly no longer \"hard\" edges. Hit an edge with enough cursor velocity, and your cursor will pop through the previously cursor-bounding edge and end up on your other monitor.\nThis occurs on a shared screen edge between multiple monitors. My main screen (on the left) is approximately 100 pixels taller than my laptop screen (on the right). However, when I activate Misson Control and then ram my cursor exactly into the main screen's top-right corner, it then pops out into my laptop display 100 pixels below. Very annoying.\nIf anyone has any docs or blog posts that explain this change, please post!\nI noticed this Lion behavior when developing EdgeCase.\nEdgeCase might actually solve your problem. It creates hard edges that your mouse cannot cross on all shared screen edges. \nThis will allow you to throw your mouse up towards the menu bar and never miss. See screenshot.\n\n\nA: I just tested this on my new model Macbook Air with Lion. I see the same as you report: there is no \"stickiness\", the mouse cursor slides right past the Apple menu to the second screen. \n", "Q: TWAIN Drivers on Mac I'm primarily a Windows admin, but I just got a new MacBook Air with Lion on it. I'm trying to use it with my Brother MFC-7820N printer/scanner/fax device.\nI've installed drivers, and am able to both print and scan, BUT not via TWAIN (applications such as Image Capture and Preview do not show the scanner as a valid source for importing documents).\nI've downloaded the TWAIN driver. It says it installs, but doesn't prompt me to do anything (like enter the IP address of my scanner) after installing. Arrgh.\nBeing so new to Lion, and somewhat new to Mac OS (relative to my 15 years as a Windows admin), I'd love some advice on how TWAIN works on Mac OS. I'd also love to know some of the popular newsgroups or places to submit this question.\n\nA: Hamrick VueScan\nThis is a \"Swiss-Army-knife\" scanning application that supports hundreds and hundreds of makes and models of scanners, even many obsolete ones which don't have direct Mac OS X support. \nDownload and evaluate the trial version. \nI use it with my Brother MFC-6490CW, which does have Mac OS X drivers, but I'd rather use VueScan than use the Brother or Apple scanning software. Although VueScan has TWAIN support, I use it as a stand-alone scanning solution to output PDF, TIFF and JPEG.\n\nA: There's also the \"TWAIN SANE Interface - SCSI, USB scanner drivers, pref panes, libraries\".\nhttp://www.ellert.se/twain-sane/\nhttp://osx.hyperjeff.net/Apps/apps?f=twain\n\nA: Two good sources are always the community discussions at Apple Support and the Apple Support site itself. You said you downloaded the latest drivers from your scanner provider's website. However, since Lion has been out only for a few days; you may want to verify that the drivers are for Lion (10.7) and not a prior version. If they are not Lion-specific drivers, you may want to post a question into your scanner provider's support website to find out if Lion-specific drivers are coming. \nI am also a \"switcher\" from many years in the Windows world. I've been a Mac user for seven  years now and drivers haven't been an issue as much as it was with Windows for me. Hardware makers are much better about keeping up with Mac OS X than before as far as drivers. However, there are still some vendors out there that just don't. \nAs a reference, this article shows how TWAIN support required upgrades from your vendor when Mac OS X went into version 10.2. So, it wouldn't be unheard of if some TWAIN scanners stopped working now that we're on 10.7. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: I have the same Brother printer and could print to it but couldn't scan at first. On OS X 10.11, I went to the Brother support website for the MFC-7820N and downloaded the \"Scanner Driver\" for 10.10 (the latest os supported version listed). After installing that driver, Image Capture found the scanner. \nI also had to delete and re-add the printer entry in the System Preferences. The old entry was setup as a printer only, and when re-added showed print|scan as options.\n", "Q: How much disk space is already used by the OS and included apps on a new MacBook Air I'm considering getting a new MacBook Air, and wondering whether to get the extra diskspace that the 256GB model offers. \n128GB seems like it might be plenty but then I remembered that the OS takes up some space the pre installed apps also take up some space.

I have other apps, so this is only a guess, but...\n\n\n*\n\n*Lion: 4-5 GB \n\n*iLife '11: 5 GB \n\n*Recovery Partition: 650 MB\n\n\nSo, on a 128GB Air, you should see about 115-118GB free space. On a 256GB Air, you would see about 243-246GB free space.\n", "Q: How do I speed up a USB external hard drive? I am using an external USB drive for video. Is it possible to increase the speed of the drive to make rendering/copying/, etc., faster? When I have a couple of applications writing to the drive, and I open up the hard drive in the Finder, it takes awhile to load the files/folders.\n\nA: There's not much you can do to \"optimize\" your transfer rate. OS X should be maxing out your USB connection as it is.\nIf that's not fast enough you might want to look at a USB 3 drive (if you're not already using one) or a Firewire drive which will give you better throughput. FireWire enclosures are a bit more expensive but they're worth it if you need higher throughput (for say, video rendering, etc).\n", "Q: Image dimensions not showing in item info on second drive On my second drive image dimensions do not show. On my main drive they do.\nIs there some way to enable that? \nThanks a lot.\nEDIT: The second drive is 'Mac OS Extended (Journaled)'. If i make a new folder on the drive and paste a pic in it works, but others it not. Yes, i have checked \"Show Item Info\" in View Options. \nit shows item count and some file size info but not image dimensions\nEDIT2: its just a folder tree on a drive that not show it... if i rename the tree they show, rename back and they stop showing. if i copy a file to a new dir or root it shows\nhow to change or reset what shows where? i tried adding and remiving from spotlight privacy window but\n\nA: As with thumbnails for movies, dimensions of images lots of times don't load until they are either opened, or left highlighted for a bit. I went through my images and found many didn't have dimensions either. After highlighting them for a minute or opening them with preview however, the dimensions showed. So chances are Finder doesn't open the file to find the dimensions until it needs to.\n", "Q: How do you turn Three Finger Drag on? I'm trying to use the new \"three finger drag\" gesture in Lion and it's not working. There isn't a preference setting for it in TrackPad -> Point and Click either. Does anyone know how to turn it on?\n\nA: Some older Macs only support two finger scrolling on the trackpad, not three. Since you're not seeing a setting for three finger drag, I'd guess your hardware just doesn't support it.\nAre you able to do other gestures that require more than two fingers? If not, it's probably a hardware limitation, and you could just get a Magic Trackpad.\n\nA: I've been trying to figure this out as well and found it on another site , so here you go:\nSystem Preferences->Universal Access->Mouse and Trackpad->Trackpad Options-> then you have your choice of dragging with or without draglock :)\nHope this helps!\nSource: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110630003322997\n\nA: If you look under all your settings, you have the option to change to 2 or 3 finger swipe.\n", "Q: Connecting Time Capsule (or AEBS) to a AT&T U-verse Router/Modem - Proper Settings and Setup? Today I am giving AT&T U-verse a go to see if it will be better than my current service provider. The general install went fine, but there are new intricacies that wreaked a bit of havoc on my network setup. \nBefore, I had a basic cable modem and connected my Time Capsule to the cable modem and everything was run from the Time Capsule. Pretty basic. \nBut with U-verse, they provide you what they call a residential gateway which basically is the hub for your internet and tv data (I think). It is a 2Wire 3801HGV. On the internet side, this hub serves as a both a wireless router and modem. It has NAT, dishes out IP addresses, allows wireless clients, etc. But, I wanted my Time Capsule to be the wireless hub since I use it for backup, etc. \nSo when the install was done, and I tried to connect the Time Capsule to the 2Wire, the Time Capsule blinked yellow. After some research, I realized this was probably due to the 2wire and Time Capsule fighting over dishing out IP addresses, but I am not 100% sure that is the case.\nAnyway, to get around this issue, I turned off the wireless connectivity on the 2Wire, changed the Time Capsule to Bridge Mode instead of the current setting of \"Share a Public IP address\". I then connected an ethernet cable from a port in the 2Wire to the WAN connection on the Time Capsule, and everything seems to work ok connection wise. The Time Capsule light is green, and I can connect wirelessly from my computers at home.\nHowever, I lose functionality. My Guest Network capability from the Time Capsule is gone. I don't think Back To My Mac is operational.\nIs this the way you would have set things up? Is this loss of functionality expected? Anyway around this loss of functionality. I read, but did not quite understand, some people talking about DMZs and bypassing the routing on the 2Wire. Would that be better? Also, as a bonus, would you connect other direct-connect devices (Ooma, for example) to the 2Wire or to the Time Capsule?\n\nA: First, connect one of the Ethernet ports of the 2Wire Gateway to the WAN port of the Time Capsule and turn both devices on, and disable wireless on the 2Wire. Your Time Capsule settings should not be changed from what they were when you had things working with your cable modem. If you've changed them, change them back now.\nThen, on the 2Wire Gateway, in the \"LAN\" section:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable DMZ for the Time Capsule connection\n\n*Turn off the firewall for the Time Capsule connection\n\n*Set the Address Assignment for the Time Capsule connection to \"public\"\n\n*Set the WAN IP Mapping for the Time Capsule connection to \"Router WAN IP address\"\n\n\nThen cycle power on the Time Capsule. The Time Capsule will now control everything just like it did when it was connected directly to your cable modem. Any wired Ethernet connections you add should be connected to the Time Capsule, not the 2Wire Gateway.\nFYI, this works for any router or access point, not just the Time Capsule.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of the sub headings in finder with \"arrange be date created\" in Lion So I installed Lion and I can't stand the way finder arranges icons arrange by date. Finder makes a bunch of sub headings like: today, yesterday, past 30 days or earlier. These settings have a show all button/coverflow thing. Is there a way to get rid of the headings? Thanks.\n\nA: There's a new toolbar button in Finder, called Arrange. If you choose to arrange by anything in that menu, you'll get the new headings that you've described. To disable this sorting and get the standard click-to-sort column headers back, click the Arrange button, and set it to \"None.\"\n\n", "Q: How do I determine when my Macbook pro was manufactured? I have an early 2011 17\" Macbook Pro which is giving me issues related to SATA 6.0gbps; these issues were apparently consistent with the first machines off the line but some of the later machines have been better. I bought my first in March but fed up with the issue I went this week and bought another - alas - same issue. \nHow can I determine the manufacturing date of the machine?\n\nA: This web service can give you information about the date your Mac was manufactured. You just input your serial number. You can find the serial number by going to the Apple menu > About this Mac. The Serial Number is the bottom of the list.\n\nhttp://www.chipmunk.nl/klantenservice/applemodel.html\nMacrumors.com also has an interesting article about the information encoded in Mac serial numbers.\n\nA: https://serial-number-decoder.com/ worked for me.\n\nIt is now one of the most comprehensive sets of serial number decoders on the internet. Aimed at collectors, sellers, dealers and eBayers, it now covers vintage or antique Rolex, Tissot, Timex, Elgin, Casio, Citizen and Omega watches as well as Gibson, Fender and CF Martin guitars, Roland and Boss (which includes all the old analogue gear and Boss pedals), Kawai and Yamaha pianos, DOD and Ibanez guitar pedals, Hot Wheels diecast models and some electronic component dating tools useful for dating vintage guitars, pedals and synthesizers. Recent additions have been tools to date and identify Apple devices as well as Samsung Galaxy and Sony Xperia mobile phones.\n\n\nA: I'm always hesitant to recommend an app to do what a terminal command could do... but I cannot for the life of me find the terminal command to output the date of manufacture of any given Mac.\nSo...\nI recommend the free app coconutBattery for this task.  It's a battery health monitor, and it happens to also show the date of manufacture of the Mac that it's running on.\nInstallation\nbrew cask install coconutbattery (if you use Homebrew) or download from the developer's site.\n\n\nA: The serial number of an Apple product has (almost always) the manufacture\ndate encoded.   For a CPU, first two characters of the serial number is the factory code, next three are the year (one digit only), and week.\nSo, for my MacBook Pro, the serial number \"WQ929xxxxxx\"\nindicates the twenty-ninth week of 2009 as the date of manufacture.\nThe format could change, of course, but this has been the pattern for years.\nUnder the Apple menu, \"About This Mac\" can be selected, to show the \nserial number, or you can hunt the case of an iPad or iMac for a label.\nIn case of a repair and motherboard replacement, the software \nmight no longer know that serial number.\n\nA: Try the official support page at Apple for determining your MacBook model. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Get the serial number from About This Mac menu item and check it here . It will give complete information about warranty and manufacturing date.\n\nA: I've had good luck asking at the genius bar or Apple Care online. They've been able to help me determine manufacture date.\n", "Q: Why does iPhone Voice Control turn on when I wear headphones while working out? I listen to music on my iPhone 4 while working out on stair master. After about an hour, voice control turns on by itself. I turn it off but it comes back on. Then the iPod is paused then skips couple songs. It doesn't stop.  I think it has to do with headphones or something. Maybe sweat getting into headphones?  This happens almost every time I work out. \nApparently this is common issue. \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2512674?start=0&tstart=0\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/9714491#9714491\n\nA: It certainly sounds like the headphones are causing this. It's likely that moisture is eventually getting into the in-line switch/microphone module which is bridging the switch terminals and sending spurious signals to the phone.\nHowever, I'd try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check for liquid damage inside the headphone socket: Hold your phone up to the light so that you can see down inside of the headphone port. There's a small indicator at the bottom of the port which will have turned a red/pink colour if liquid has come into contact with it. If positive, this could indicate that the phone's headphone socket may (also) be at fault.\n\n*Obtain another pair of the same Apple headphones and see if the issue occurs again.\n\nA: This happened to me as well, much to my frustration. I have since found that it doesn't happen as long as I keep the headphone cable on the outside of my clothing instead of underneath it. When I'm in the gym I used to run the cable down underneath my shirt to stop it catching on things. I think the noise from my shirt rubbing on the microphone my have been activating voice control. Since I started running it down the outside of my clothes into my pocket I have had no issues. \n\nA: I wrapped the headphone wire where the mic and controls are with a few layers of Saran Wrap. This keeps the sweat out but still allows use of the controls. Used to have the random Siri problem described all the time on long runs, did a hot sweaty 18 mile run today with Saran Wrap and had no problems.\n\nA: Based on my past experience, my recommendation is to power off the phone, recharge it, and see if that fixes the problem.\nI had a huge problem with my iPhone 4 where it just kept going to Voice Control. It went on and on all night and called random people in the middle of the night! Not good!\nFinally cos it had been so active all day it died on me so I let it. Peace for one night! Anyway the next day when I charged it, it was all working good again and no problems so far.\n\nA: Tis was a major problem for me and I just blew hard straight into the hole where the headphones go and the problem was fixed for me! \n\nA: this has happened to me, its is the headphone jack, and it will need to be replacd, its not too expensive. about £30 uk money.\n", "Q: How long does a clean install of Lion take? How long should I expect it to take to do a clean install of Lion on an already-formatted disk? I'm using a mid-2010 15\" MacBook Pro with an i7 and a 5,400RPM 500GB hard drive.\n(I ask because I think my hard drive is in bad condition, and the installation seems like it's taking too long.)\n\nA: About 40 minutes or so.

We will  dive\n  straight into the core Objective-C syntax and constructs, use of Xcode\n  as a development tool, the Foundation  framework, how to build your\n  own Objective-C classes, properties and methods, a thorough\n  explanation of memory  management issues on the iPhone and will use\n  Xcode and GDB to debug an iPhone app. \nDAY TWO: Building a basic iPhone\n  application, using Interface Builder, Views, View Controllers & Table\n  Views Day two starts with the build of a complete iPhone app. We then\n  look in depth into views, the iPhone view hierarchy,  the concept of\n  delegates, Interface Builder and view controllers. We look in more\n  detail into table views, navigation  and navigation controllers and\n  learn techniques to ensure that our app can scale in the real world.\n  DAY THREE: Application Navigation, Animation and Multi Touch,\n  Deployment, Provisioning Profiles and the App  Store. On day three we\n  look at image handling, resources and how to create those beautiful\n  custom table cells. We  then go on to interacting with web services\n  and building our very own Twitter client before we take a deeper look\n  at  the development and deployment process, iTunes connect, the App\n  Store and marketing\n\n", "Q: How long should it take to enable FileVault 2 on a fresh Lion installation? How long should I expect it to take to enable FileVault 2 on a fresh installation of Lion? I'm using a mid-2010 15\" MacBook Pro with an i7 and a 5,400RPM 500GB hard drive with only 10GB used.\nJohn Siracusa's 19-page review for Ars Technica had this to say:\n\nEncryption happens transparently in the background, which is a good thing because it takes a long time.\n\nHopefully someone can be a bit more precise than this.\n\nA: You might find that the time taken relates to the size of the volume to be converted (not limited to the amount used). \nPersonal estimates of duration may be difficult. \nExpect the most reliable estimates to be offered by System Preferences. If the system was only recently started, don't expect an accurate estimate of time; and don't be surprised if the estimate rises occasionally. \nFor more detail than is given by the progress bar in System Preferences: in Terminal you can run the following command, which will display a tree view of the CoreStorage world:\ndiskutil coreStorage list\nWithin the tree you'll see sizes; amounts converted. \nIf a volume is heavily used during conversion, it might slightly extend the time taken to complete but for your 10 GB used I would not expect there to be any difference. Use the volume as you normally would until conversion completes. \n\nA: 2 consecutive vault activations on a 2 new MBP w 750gb drives. Each was a clean Lion install with nothing else on it. \nTime to encrypt: 12 hours minimum each time. By far the longest running disk encryption on any platform I have ever used. Also, this is the only disk encryption I have used that allowed me to use the machine whilst it was grinding bits. I accept the trade-off.\n\nA: Your mileage may vary, but it took about an hour to do on my clean Lion install (less than 10GB IIRC), Vertex 2 SSD. It'll obviously take longer the more data you have and the slower your drive.\n\nA: Mine may be the \"untypical\" case. Upgraded my mid 2010 2.66 GHz i7 MBP 17\" from Snow Leopard 10.6.8 (including the supplementary update) to Lion, then enabled File Vault on the 500GB internal HDD (14+GB free) and continued working. Took more than 16 hours -- continuous -- as I didn't turn off the MBP until it was done.\n\nA: My personal experience is that it's faster than Bitlocker on Windows i.e. no more than 1 hour usually. Bitlocker on Windows usually takes several hours depending on drive size of course but even on small, fast raptor drive it takes forever. Encryption on Lion is painless in comparison, especially since it will run in background and even resume if you turn of computer.\nI don't have any benchmarks to back this up by I'm sure Ars Technica or Anandtech will come out with some soon.\n\nA: On an early 2016 MacBook I got out of the box this week and on which I already have 30GB in use it said 30 minutes right at the start. It seems to be faster than that actually because I started answering this and now it's already down to 15 minutes.\nPlus I can use it to do other things while it's encrypting.\n\n", "Q: Reinstall Purchased Mac App from AppStore After fresh install the Mac OS X Lion, when I tried to download again my purchased mac apps with App Store, I found that they are checked as installed. \nHow can I reinstall my paid apps?\n\n\nA: In essence, unmount the volumes with those apps and the App Store will let you download things.\n\nI noticed after the upgrade to lion when my TM volume was connected some apps in the app store appeared to be already installed. So try to disconnect or shut off your external HDD and restart the app store so you can reinstall your apps. After that you can re-activate your TM volume. This isn't normal, since spotlight shouldn't look inside the backup volume and see an app installed, but it happened once so it could happen to you as well.\n\nA: The problem is there because Spotlights finds Apps on other Partitions and flag them as installed. There are two ways to get that solved. First you delete the lsregister by launching Terminal and pasting this command:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\nIf that won't help, then unmount the Volume where the Apps are installed, Time Machine Volumes also count from previous/other OS installations. \nFirst you need to find out the GUID of the partition:\nLaunch Disk Utility, click the Partition and then the Info button in left upper corner. Your GUID should look be something like AC55A321-C9A5-3EF1-AE76-079470489A4B. Copy it into clipboard, lunch Terminal and type:\nsudo vifs \nThats vi editor specially for your /etc/fstab file where filesystems mount points are defined in Bsd/Linux os's. VI is a bit different in editing so don't get scared. You navigate through text with H J K L keys. Get down a few lines, hit the i key (stands for Insert) press Enter to get a new line \nand type GUID= then paste your GUID in there. After the GUID type:  \nnone hfs rw, noauto\nThe line should look like this:\nUUID=AC55A321-C9A5-3EF1-AE76-079470489A4B none hfs rw,noauto\nnone stands for no Volume Mountpoint. hfs stands for Hierarchical Files System in short and it's Apples own filesystem. rw stands for read/write access. noauto stands for no auto\n   mount. When your line looks like the one above hit the esc then type : and wq! this will write the changes and and quit the editor. Should you make any mistakes, just press esc to get out of editing mode and hut u to undo things.\nReboot the OS, check App Store and voilà, you can reinstall your Apps.\nAfter that reedit the /etc/fstab with vifs and delete the line you added by navigating the cursor to that line and punching the d key twice.\n", "Q: How to make the scrollbars appearing on demand on Lion This is very neat to not always have the scroll bars displayed over every windows. I might be facing an edge case though: when opening a vnc session I sometimes need to scroll the window displaying the remote display but as expected it does not scroll when the cursor is inside the window as the mouse events are handled by the remote system. This means that to scroll I either toggle the show scroll bars to always or resize the window to make the scroll bars appearing a few moments.\nMy question: is there a way to make the scroll bars appearing without having always as  show scroll bars setting or resizing the window?\n\nA: You should be able to grab the invisible scrollbars. Just click and drag near the edge of the window where the scrollbars should be and they should appear. I can't say if this works correctly for all types of windows though.\n\nA: Further to @deceze answer, I had to resize the window (in my case, it was Chicken of the VNC), the scroll bar appears, move the mouse slightly over the scroll bar & adjust.\nIf I moved off the scroll bar, it disappears and I have to resize the window again.\nSame for Safari.\n", "Q: Is there a way to turn off autosave feature in Lion OS X?

In Windows I can create self-extracting archives, which end in exe instead of rar, and then you don't need to have an unarchiver available to extract them. How can I create a self-extracting archive for Mac?\nI need to distribute for download a large (100 mb when compressed) archive from a server to many mac users. I'd rather use a better compression like RAR or LZMA, but I need to be sure that it can be opened by everyone without needing to install anything.\n\nA: OSX contains an unarchiver so you don't need the equivalent of a .exe so you can extract on any machine and not be stuck as you are on a Mac when you receive a Windows self-extracting archive\nTo archive select the files in Finder. Command-click or right-click and choose compress from the menu - you will get Archive.zip. To unzip just double click on the .zip file\nThe tool that does the unarchiving is Archive Utility.app and understands various compression schemes from Wikipaedia including bzip2 which can be better than zip - but you need to compress using a command line tool bzip2\n\nA: According to the StuffIt for Mac comparison page and an ehow howto, the Deluxe version can create self-extracting archives.\n\n\nA: Also 7zX (Freeware) has the ability to create self-extracting archives.

I've tried to rename to .iso and to use NRG2ISO with no luck.\nAny tips ?\n\nA: Had the same experience as the OP. Tried using nrg2iso, tried renaming the file to .iso and also tried the dd command from that MacRumors thread. Nothing worked.\nHowever, I then found nrg4iso which worked perfectly!

How do you pronounce the clover-like key ⌘ ?\n\nA: As above, \"Command\" is the usual name. For some context, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key\n\nA: I usually say \"command\", but I've also heard it pronounced doily\n\nA: It was originally known as the \"Places of Interest\" symbol used in Northern Europe on maps and such.\nHere's some history on it:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John%27s_Arms\nBut when I tell people to press it I say \"command\".\n\nA: This is usually called the \"command\" key. Others just call it the \"apple\" key...\n\nA: It's called the Command key, abbreviated as Cmd.\nCommon nicknames are \"clover\" or \"butterfly\".\nThe symbol is based on one used on signs in Swedish campgrounds to note a place of interest; Susan Kare of the original Mac team located it in a international symbol dictionary while looking for something to replace the Apple logo, which Steve Jobs felt was being overused. (The whole story is on Folklore.org.)\nOn the Apple II, the keyboard featured open-Apple (an outline) and closed-Apple (filled in) keys beside the space bar. On early Macs, the same key had both the Command symbol and an Apple logo printed on it, and so some people carried over the terminology and continued to call it the Apple key.\nOn newer Macs, the Apple logo has been removed, and the key features only the command symbol and the text \"command\".\n\nA: In Sweden you often hear runa (rune, which is somewhat related to the historic origin for the use on Swedish road signs) or kringla (pretzel, based on the shape) for this symbol when used in Mac context.\n\nA: When I worked at Apple (1992-1997), quite a large proportion of the engineers called it \"the propeller key\". The suits almost always called it \"the command key\", and viewed the engineer's nomenclature as being disrespectful or merely irreverent.\n\nA: It used to be called \"Splat\", but sadly that has fallen out of use.\n\nA: I've been a Mac user since 1988, and I've always called it (and heard it referred to as) \"butterfly.\"\n\nA: I call it the \"church\" key\n\nA: I call it \"mela\", which just means \"apple\" in italian.\n\nA: Actually the use of the Butterfly Key was in retaliation of IBM, and of the slavery early programers associated with Big Blue(IBM) as an oligarchic company bent on suppressing of new ideas and of the casual freedoms that the Bay Area was known for so they did away with the oppressive \"Command Key\" and thus gave it a splat, butterfly or whatever you want to call it. \nThe idea was to be liberated and not controlled. Which is funny since Apple literally controlled every aspect of their early computer architecture and squashed any freedom to developers to give the Mac OS the power or the programs it needed. \nBut the Butterfly is a statement, not a reality. \n", "Q: Why aren't mp3 files I deleted by accident showing up in the Trash? I accidentally deleted all the mp3 files on my computer (as opposed to just the ones in my downloads folder). There were a lot of files (around 2,000) so it took a while to delete but now, although at the bottom trash says it holds 2,500 files, they don't show up.\nI need to drag these back onto my computer into their respective folders but I can't find them.\nI am running Mac OS X 10.8 (Leopard) on an iMac.\nAny assistance would be much appreciated!\n\nA: \nYes I do, is there a command to move them to another folder? In the short term I don't mind where they are, as long as they're not sitting in the trash waiting to get deleted! \n\nAnswering down here to have enough room.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new folder to move all these files from the Trash into. It can be anything, for this example I'll create a folder called \"undeleted\" on the Desktop.\n\n*Open up a Terminal window, and navigate to the Trash: cd ~/.Trash.\n\n*Confirm that the stuff you want is there: ls -a.\n\n*Move the mp3s: mv *.mp3 ~/Desktop/undeleted. If you create a different folder somewhere else, the easiest way to get its path is to drag it into the Terminal window. Type in mv *.mp3  including the trailing space, then drag the folder you want the files to go into into the window - it'll automatically fill in the correct path. The * wildcard will match any .mp3 it finds.\n\n*If you have any AAC encoded songs, repeat the above, but change the extension to .m4a: mv *.m4a ~/Desktop/undeleted\n", "Q: How do I get the iTunes play control widget back in Dashboard? In OS X 10.7 Lion, the iTunes dashboard widget from 10.6 Snow Leopard is no longer on the dashboard, I can't find a method of adding it again, it doesn't appear to be listed.\nI frequently used this to control play/pause and track forward back.\n\nA: You can download it here.\n", "Q: OS X Lion - Finder: Difference of \"Sort by\", \"Clean Up By\" and \"Arrange by\" There is an option in the Finder.\nRight click in the background of a finder window, the new toolbar icon or\ncmd+j. To change the view of the sorting/arranging I can choose between \n\"Sort by\"\n\"Clean Up By\"\n\"Arrange by\"\nIt seems they do the same.\nAnyone knows the difference of them?\n\nA: If you select \"clean by\" the icons will be sorted into the order you choose, but you can still slide them around.\nIf you select \"arrange by\" the icons will always snap back to a sorted grid and you will no longer be able to slide them around.\n\nA: Clean Up By is only available in icon view. If Arrange By is not set to None, it doesn't seem to do anything until you change Arrange By to None. If Arrange By is set to None and Sort By is set to Snap to Grid, it arranges icons so that they are aligned on a grid. If Arrange By is set to None and Sort By is set to anything else, it sorts icons and changes Sort By to None.\nThe Arrange By modes were added in Lion. They group items under sections like this in different view modes:\n\nList views cannot be sorted by clicking the headings when items are arranged by some attribute.\nWhen items are arranged by some attribute, Sort By affects the way items are sorted inside the categories in some cases, but in other cases it's disabled.\nSort By doesn't group items under sections. The Sort by mode is changed when for example clicking the list headings in list view. The Arrange By menus change to Sort By when holding option:\n\n", "Q: What does Mail do when it sends Windows friendly attachments? What does Mail do to the file or files differently when it sends attachments that are Windows friendly? \n\n\nA: According to http://www.ncmug.org/tips/mail_attachments.html:\n\nBy default, Mail assumes your recipient is also a Mac user and therefore includes the resource forks (if any) of attached files. Normally a Mac user sees such attachments as a single file, whereas a Windows user sees two individual files - one containing the data fork of the file and the other containing the resource fork.\nWhen you choose \"Windows Friendly\" attachments, Mail strips the resource fork so that Windows users receive just one file, not two (one of which would be unusable anyway). In most cases - at least for files created with modern applications - all the crucial parts of files are in the data fork; as long as the filename has the correct extension and they have an appropriate application, Windows users can open the file.\n\n", "Q: What can cause the volume keys to not work but show the prohibitory sign instead of changing volume? When i try to reduce my mac book volume it suddenly shows that this isn't possible, even the icon in the menu bar is (grey inactive)\nThis happens sometimes since i installed lion os\n\n\nA: The first thing to check is the selected output device in System Preferences. To do that, open System Preferences and click on \"Sound\". \n\nNext, go through each of the tabs to verify that you don't see any obvious settings. I've seen this before on Snow Leopard, and although I'm now on Lion, I don't think this changed much.\n\nI don't remember what the setting were, but it was fairly obvious to me what to change.\n\nA: Check inside the headphone jack. Is a red light showing? If so, the MacBook might be trying to output optical audio. Make sure nothing is stuck in there - lint, dust, etc. Plugging in and then removing headphones may also help. If the red light stays, best to bring it in for service.\n\nA: I have experienced this issue starting with my new install of Lion. I haven't been able to find the cause of the issue but I do have a quick way to reset the audio system and get back volume control. \nOpen Activity Monitor (Its in Applications/Utilities)\nMake sure it is set to All Processes, look for coreaudiod, click \"Quit Process\" then \"Quit\". Wait a few seconds and you should have volume control back.\nIf your a terminal buff a quick sudo killall coreaudiod should whip it into shape. \n\nA: As you suggested, I cHecked inside the headphone jack and found a red light showing.   Plugging in and then removing headphones solved the problem.  Thank you for the advice.\n\nA: When I had to use Force Quit to close a stuck Premier Elements 9, it somehow reset the audio. Go to System Preferences → Sound → Output and re-choose Internal Speakers to get the sound going again, as well as the buttons on the keyboard to control the speakers.\n\nA: I personally tried most of the listed above. What I ended up doing before I did anything too crazy (i'm not super techy) is I just put in my earbuds again and took them out. I didn't have a read light going near the headphone jack, but it did the job. Now I have control again!

Is there a way to install Xcode Toolset? \n\n\nA: The installer for Xcode 3.x fails when you try to run the installer against Lion.\nXcode 4.0 also does not work under Lion, and purposely refuses to start. \nSome Developer applications (like Dashcode) do start but more often than not just crash.\nIf you really depend on Xcode 3 your best bet is to keep Snow Leopard on a second partition alongside Lion and dual boot when needed. AFAIK you can nonetheless target previous Mac OS X and iOS versions to some extend in Xcode 4.1.\nYou can try installing it on Snow Leopard and then upgrading to Lion - that's the best chance, but it might be easier to keep an external disk bootable with Snow Leopard and Xcode 3.x just in case you run into any glitches down the road.\n\nA: This site has a trick to install Xcode 3.2.6 on Lion at your own risk.\n", "Q: Create a HTML bundle?

Ideally I would like to be able to use an icon on the file as well.\nIs there a plugin for Chrome or Firefox that I could use to save page as a bundle?\n\nA: Safari and TextEdit allow you to create a .webarchive package.\nWhat I'd recommend is creating your site and open it in Safari to save it as .webarchive.\nI'm not sure about customizing the icon… not sure if that is supported for webarchive bundles.\n", "Q: How do I move application data from one Mac account to another? I'd like to move my kids applications to a separate account but am trying to figure out the best way to move the application data.  For example, are documents and settings stored somewhere consistently on a Mac or do I need to use some sort of migration assistant?\n\nA: The migration assistant makes it very easy to move a whole account. You could then make an applications folder in their account (before or after the migration) to contain the apps you only want to be seen by them.\n", "Q: Did the recent Safari 5.1 upgrade break my Vienna display styles?

I've obviously tried restarting the apps, both Safari and Vienna, and nothing seems to make any difference.  I'm sure it's possible some /Library file is responsible, but I don't know which one or how to determine which one.  Anyone?\n\nA: Short answer:  Yes.  \nDue to complications with Sparkle updates, according to this thread, the 'check for updates' process did not find the latest version.  Webkit2 has some additional security considerations, apparently.  Upgrading to 2.5.1.2502 is the solution.\n", "Q: Where can I find a list of changes to Terminal.app in Lion? I'm thinking of upgrading to Lion after hearing that they've upgraded Terminal.app somewhat. The main thing I've heard is that Terminal.app now supports 256 colors, but I don't care about colors. I want mouse events in screen without using MouseTerm.\nWhere can I find all the changes to Terminal.app provided by Lion? Are mouse events included in this update?\n\nA: I don't use mouse events, but they appear to at least partially work in iTerm 2, which does not require Lion or MouseTerm.  I tested with \"set mouse=a\" in vim and was able to select using the mouse, etc.\n\nA: The Terminal changes in Lion aren't very major, from what I've seen, but they're listed here. Still no mouse events, unfortunately. If you have access, I suggest filing a feature request.\n", "Q: Will Terminal show a progress bar when I copy with \"cp\"?

I have an external HD that's about 60% full. The remaining space is more than enough for a Time Machine backup of my hard drive. If I enable Time Machine using that disc, will it erase my existing files, or just use the free space?\n\nA: If you want an encrypted backup, Time Machine will erase the contents on the drive as part of the encryption process. (It is a full disk encryption.) In that case, yes, you'll need a dedicated blank drive.\n\nA: No, it does not. It creates a Backups.backupdb/ directory for itself and leaves your other files untouched.\nHowever, if (on Lion) you want to encrypt your backup it uses the same full-disc encryption as FileVault, and I think your other files on the disc will also be subject to that. (I haven't tried this myself.)\n\nA: It will require you to erase the disk if it doesn't like the format of the disk. In this case, I have an ExFAT disk that has 7.5TB and even unencrypted, it requires me to erase it. It requires HFS+ or AFS.\n\n\nIf I click \"Don't Erase\" then it takes me back to the home screen and nothing happens.\n\nA: It will just use the free space but it won't backup the files on that disk as stated on the relevant Apple support document \n\nTime Machine works best if you use your backup disk only for Time Machine backups. If you keep separate files on your backup disk, Time Machine won’t back up those files, and the space available for Time Machine backups will be reduced. \n\n\nA: No it will not erase your existing files. Time machine will create a folder on your external hard drive called Backups.backupdb. This will contain your time machine backups. Once your disc space is full, time machine will start erasing old backups however so it can always store your most-recent backup.\n\nA: If the disc was formatted for Windows/PC use, it would need to be reformatted and formatting it for Time Machine will erase all data.\n\"Time Machine can’t back up to an iPod, iPad, or iPhone, or a disk formatted for Windows. If you connect a disk formatted for Windows, it can be reformatted (permanently removing all data) to a Mac filesystem format and used as a backup disk.\"\nBackup disks you can use with Time Machine\n\nA: The drive needs to be in HFS+ format first. However if you select the drive in Time Machine, it will still want to erase it first — therefore — create a folder on the drive called: Backups.backupdb\nThen when you go to select the drive for backup, it will see the existing Backups.backupdb folder on it, and validate it as a Time Machine backup drive, and continue with using the drive as a backup destination.\n\nA: I created 3 1G partition on my 3G external drive. One is for Time Machine, one for general use and otherfor Carbon Copy Cloner. All 3 partitions work fine. No data has been deleted.\n\nA: It doesn’t have to be, but for the cost of a second drive, I’ve never ever regretted keeping the backup simple and using a second external for scratch.\nYou want to backup your files in most cases so storing them on the main backup volume is backwards. Even if you don’t care about the files, putting them on a dedicated scratch disk reduces the risk of a mistake to the backup volume.\n", "Q: Both Quicktime Player and VLC keep stopping the video (but not the audio) since 10.6.8. Any ideas? Since I updated to 10.6.8 yesterday (and this might be coincidence), both Quicktime Player (I still use 7) and VLC (current version) keep stopping the video (but not the audio) of movies I am watching. This happens whether they are in the background or fullscreen and fixes itself when the program gains focus.\nIs this a faulty video driver that came with 10.6.8 or what could be the reason?\nMac Pro 2009 2x2.26 GHz, 24 GB, ATI Radeon HD 4870.\n\nA: This kind of behavior, whether it is video only stopping (but audio continuing) or audio only stopping (but video continuing), has happened to me when the machine was over-loaded with other processes running. Quitting chrome, with my many open tabs, has solved the problem for me before.\n", "Q: Is it legal to burn an iTunes playlist to an audio CD and give it a friend as a gift? All the music on my iPod is legal, either ripped from my own CDs or purchased from the iTunes Store.\nOn a road trip recently a friend said she liked the music, so I was thinking of making her a mixed CD of some of the songs.\nI know I can make a mixed CD of the songs for my own use in my own car, but is it legal for me to give the mixed CD to her as a gift?\nThanks.\nNote: Author of question is from Canada.\n\nA: In Canada this is not legal. Private copying is covered by a levy you pay on the blank CD-R media you are burning the tracks to but private copies are for your own use, they cannot be given away. There's some contrast here with CDs that's interesting. With physical media like tapes or CDs the \"owner\" is the person in possession of the original copy. This definition made it legit, at least in Canada, to borrow original materiel, copy it, and then return it. The levy on the CD-R covered the royalty payment for the copy (in theory) and you weren't obligated to destroy copies if the original left your possession. With downloaded content you can't give away the original in the same sense as physical media. Lending downloaded media and non-private copying of downloaded media are essentially indistinguishable actions.\nSome legal alternatives in Canada:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy all the songs in physical format and make your mix tape from those\n\n*Buy her the tracks as gifts via iTunes\n\n*Buy you and her a month subscription to Rdio and make her a shared playlist there\n\n\nDownloaded content has taken all the romance out of making mix tapes, that's for certain.\n\nA: Under US copyright law, that is illegal, as the license you receive for the music you get through iTunes does not grant you distribution permissions.\nOn the other hand, you are highly unlikely to get caught, and if she likes the music she may just buy it herself. I am not recommending that you violate copyright, just stating the obvious. You should not violate copyright laws, as that would be illegal.\nTo be completely above-board, you could make your mix playlist, share it on the iTunes store, and gift it to her. Then she would have licenses for the music.\n\nA: It is a question where you live. If you live in Germany you can do that.\n", "Q: Is it possible to force the next boot to be a recovery mode boot with a bluetooth keyboard? I wanted to test the new recovery mode in Lion and can't find a way to enter that mode using a bluetooth keyboard.\nThere are steps how to get a single user mode or safe boot using sudo nvram boot-args\nI was wondering if anyone has uncovered how to get into recovery mode without having a hard wired USB keyboard. As described in the comments - this iMac is older than the ones that make bluetooth available at boot time which is why I'm looking to write something before the reboot progresses to a point where bluetooth is not available to override the default boot selection list.\n\nA: This model seems to respect the option key only - so that will get me to the startup manager and I can select the Recovery HD. \nI have not had luck getting command R to work but it's clearly meant to work as well - perhaps that's for newer macs with better bluetooth hardware (or my mac is just cranky and not working as designed)\n\nA: At least, on macbook pros (10.9 -> 10.14.6) you can run the command\nsudo nvram recovery-boot-mode=unused\n\nAnd the macbook pro will boot into recovery when you restart, the flag will be removed from nvram so you boot normal the next time after it.\n", "Q: How can I disable Mac OS Lion asking if I really want to open a downloaded file?

For whatever reason, one of our macs didn't make a recovery partition when it upgraded to Lion.\nIs it possible to add a recovery partition after the fact? \n\nTo be clear - on a normal mac, the recovery partition is hidden in both the Startup Disk system preference and the Disk Utility. You can only see it from the command line with a direct command, diskutil list or enabling the debug menu in Disk Utility. It also shows up if you boot with the option key held or if you successfully boot to recovery with Command-R a.k.a. ⌘+R during boot.\nWarning - this question and answer ONLY APPLY to 10.7.x Lion - using the Lion installer to recreate recovery on newer OS can and will cause problems due to drivers not being present for newer OS and hardware.\n\nA: First, open a Terminal.\nStatus before:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n  #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n  0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0\n  1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n  2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            127.8 GB   disk0s2\n\nGet Lion Recovery Update v1.0 (431.91 MB)\nMount RecoveryHDUpdate.dmg\n$ hdiutil attach ~/Downloads/RecoveryHDUpdate.dmg\n\nExtract data from RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg\n$ pkgutil --expand /Volumes/Mac\\ OS\\ X\\ Lion\\ Recovery\\ HD\\ Update/RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg ~/Desktop/RHD\n\nMount RecoveryHDMeta.dmg (in the RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg package)\n$ hdiutil attach ~/Desktop/RHD/RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg/RecoveryHDMeta.dmg\n\nRun tool that will finally resize current partition and create recovery\n$ ~/Desktop/RHD/RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg/Scripts/Tools/dmtest ensureRecoveryPartition / /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD\\ Update/BaseSystem.dmg 0 0 /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD\\ Update/BaseSystem.chunklist\nCreating recovery partition: finished\n\nStatus after:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n  #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n  0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0\n  1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n  2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            127.2 GB   disk0s2\n  3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\n\nA: If you reinstall OS X from App Store, it also recreates a recovery partition. I just tried it on a VM. First I removed the Recovery HD partition. Then I reinstalled OS X from App Store:\n\nIt took about two hours, and after that I had a working recovery partition again.\nReinstalling OS X over an existing installation is similar to upgrading to a new major version of OS X, or it keeps user files and settings in place but replaces system files with new versions. Apple should call it something less scary like \"repairing OS X\", because it is the solution to a lot of issues like this, and it is not such a drastic operation especially if you have backups.\nUpgrading to a new major version of OS X will also add a missing recovery partition.\nReinstalling OS X is also recommended by SuperDuper's developer:\n\nActually, you can easily recreate the recovery partition by simply reinstalling Lion from the App Store. (This has the additional benefit of updating the recovery partition with the most recent data, too.)\n\nCarbon Copy Cloner has an option to add a recovery partition, but it needs to copy the recovery partition from another disk or a backup archive. If your Mac doesn't have a recovery partition, Carbon Copy Cloner recommends reinstalling OS X:\n\n\nA: While all of the solutions outlined in this discussion will probably work, if you're using the latest version of OS X someone was kind enough to create an AppleScript that does the entire process automatically without having to run any commands from your terminal or trying to carefully manage system partitions.\nI've tested it out on Mavericks (10.9.4) and it worked great. After running the tool, I was able to enable FileVault 2 which previously refused to activate because my machine was missing a recovery partition.\n\nA: Rerunning the Installer works for OS X 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 - running the recovery disk assistant isn't a good idea if you are running 10.8 or newer OS as well as hardware that ships with newer builds of OS.\nThe Lion Recovery Disk Assistant can make a backup copy of the recovery partition.\nThe Lion Recovery Disk Assistant lets you create Lion Recovery on an external drive that has the same capabilities and limitations as the built-in Lion Recovery. Just as a backup copy of a good file needs to be made before the file comes upon it's demise, this tool will not help if you start with a partition that is missing or broken.\nRe-running the Lion installer will create a workable recovery partition.\nTo get the Installer (since we didn't save it and it deletes itself on running the first time).\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the App store and pick any view except Purchased.\n\n*Hold the option key while selecting Purchased.\n\n*Download the Lion Installer\n\n\nIt took a good 35 minutes to run the installer again. Disk Utility hides the Recovery HD (and other partitions by default) unless you enable a debug menu. You can use the diskutil list to see the Recovery HD if you don't mind terminal.app commands.\nmac:~ mike$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\nThe debug menu looks as follows - selecting show every partition will let you see whether your Recovery HD is on your drive.\n\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/users/8527/z4mba pointed out these hidden commands from this MacWorld article. I only needed to turn on/off the one command:\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled -bool true\nI don't know if you can move a Recovery HD around like a normal partition or need the other defaults write command to roll your own recovery HD, running the Lion installer a second time was fine for my needs. As many have pointed out, it appears that the recovery contents are not universal and instead customized for the specific hardware, so recreating it from the official tools is much preferred unless you wish to test well and are saving time by automating tens or hundreds of macs and can control for hardware differences in your process.\n\nA: Alternatively, you can use Carbon Copy Cloner (it has free 30 day trial).  From CCC, follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Window -> Disk Center.\n\n*In Disk Center, click the Recovery HD tab.\n\n*Click \"Create a Recovery partition for this volume\".\n\n*Done!\n\n\nA: Nice article above and reminds me to create an image of recovery partition as well as a backup.\nif you don't have recovery HD or if that has been deleted for any reason:\nRef: to my discussion: https://discussions.apple.com/message/22563466#22563466\nI have just tested it by re-installing Mac OSx, which worked like a charm. Here are the steps\nif you have existing Mac partition with data, please create a backup or image of that partition (because that will be erased)\n\n\n*\n\n*I used a Mt Lion dvd and booted the mac from it and started the disk utility\n\n*I created 2 partitions -> one with 1 GB  space and named \"Recovery HD\" and second with all the remaining space and   named \" Macintosh HD\", applied the changes, run disk repair on both partition (to be safe)\n\n*then back to disk utility and re-installed OSx from DVD to Macintosh HD partition.\n\n*after finish and reboot with Option key, you will get your recovery partition working\n\n*now if you wana restore your old HD image just go to disk util and restore image\nRef: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4718\nsanjay\n\nA: You should be able to access and inspect an existing recovery partition from the disc utility's debug menu. This is a hidden menu which can be revealed using these commands:\nEnable hidden disk image formats and debug menu in Disk Utility\nHope this helps...\n\nA: I apologize if I've misunderstood or perhaps not followed your guidelines with respect to providing an answer so if I get booted out I understand, however I believe information I obtained from your forum brought my iMac back from the brink and wanted to express my appreciation about what I've learned here.\nIn short, my 2011 27\" iMac running 10.7 lost its recovery partition and whether its necessary for one to be in place to perform a clean install of Lion over the Internet I will leave for the gurus and experts to decide... all I know is that while I was smart enough to back-up my data ( and on two different drives ) for such a possibility as a total and complete crash of my newest Mac, repeated restores from my Time Machine back up drives brought it back... but only momentarily.\nI've been a Mac user since the 1980s. My first Apple was a brand new Black & White Mac Classic. Always able to install an OS using discs which were bundled with my Macs ( that rarely misbehaved ) I was a little more than freaked out to learn that's all changed with newer Macs which is to say all I had to go on were my Time Machine drives, trusting that the OS would be put to rights via a complete restore, however not until I recreated a Lion recovery partition on the drive was I able to perform a clean OS install, again, over the Internet.\nMy iMac returned to life just yesterday morning after numerous failed attempts to bring it back and only after a clean install of 10.7 Lion. I don't know what the underlying cause of the crash was, I probably never will, but I do know I am grateful for forums like this ( where I've spent seemingly countless hours over the past week or so ) because without the information I've gleaned here my 3 year old iMac would most likely have become a lawn ornament. Chances are I would also be replacing some window glass after throwing my iMac through it out onto the lawn and while I may have felt better for a fleeting moment or two... my Mac wouldn't be fixed so tossing it wasn't an option.\nAfter reviving my iMac with a fresh copy of OS 10.7 I then proceeded to restore its pre-crash data with Migration Assistant rather than Time Machine for I reckoned that data corruption on a system level would only be duplicated back onto the drive with a complete restore which would have been a borderline stupid move given that the machine was running smoothly. Now to figure out the best means of duplicating my restored drive so that if history should repeat itself I'll have a complete local copy and not have to spend hours ( if not days ) finding answers all over again. And again... many thanks\n\nA: Are you sure it's not there? The recovery partition doesn't show up in disk utility, to view it you have to reboot and press option (alt) to get a list or drives you can boot from and you should have one called Recovery HD or if you want to access it directly just press Command-R at startup.\n", "Q: Is fine volume adjustment possible in macOS? Question broadened, as this still works in 2021\nOn previous versions of Mac OS X pressing ⌥+⇧+volume+ would adjust the volume by quarter increments. This seems to have been removed in Lion.\nIs there any way to do fine volume adjustment now?\n\nA: I don't have a keyboard shortcut or AppleScript for you, but I did notice - and others seem to confirm - that the slider you can use when you click the volume icon in the menu bar moves much more smoothly in Lion than it did in previous versions of OS X. As I recall it used to sort of jump from level to level, sort of like how it did when you pushed the volume buttons on the keyboard. Now it slides easily between increments. \n\nA: I don't have enough reputation or else I would have entered this as a comment to Nathan Greenstein's answer.\nI turned his information into a simple command line script to adjust the volume:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nusage()\n{\n    echo 1>&2 \"Usage:\" \"$0\" \"[relative volume change in the range -100..100 (default -2)]\"\n    exit -1\n}\n\ncase $# in\n    0)\n        VOLCHANGE=-2\n        ;;\n    1)\n        VOLCHANGE=$1\n        ;;\n    *)\n        usage\n        ;;\nesac\n\n## Check the VOLCHANGE parameter.\nif ! ( echo \"${VOLCHANGE}\" | egrep '^-?[0-9]+$' > /dev/null )\nthen\n    echo 1>&2 \"ERROR: Bad volume adjustment parameter:\" \"${VOLCHANGE}\"\n    usage\nfi\n\nosascript -e \"set volume output volume ((output volume of (get volume settings)) + ${VOLCHANGE})\"\n\necho \"New volume:\" $(osascript -e 'output volume of (get volume settings)') \"(adjusted by ${VOLCHANGE})\"\n\n\nA: You can do precise volume adjustment with AppleScript, controlled on a scale of 0 thru 100.\nset volume output volume 0 --mute\nset volume output volume 100 --100%\nset volume output volume 27 --27%\n\nYou can get the current volume (also 0 thru 100):\nset currentVolume to output volume of (get volume settings)\n\nSo, you can write a little script to increment the volume by 2% (approximately what one quarter square used to be):\nset currentVolume to output volume of (get volume settings)\nset volume output volume (currentVolume + 2)\n\nYou can make one for decrementing by changing that plus sign to a minus sign:\nset currentVolume to output volume of (get volume settings)\nset volume output volume (currentVolume - 2)\n\nIf you want to get the volume sound like usual, add the following line:\ndo shell script \"afplay /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/volume.aiff\"\n\nYou can save this as a script or app, and bind it to a mouse or keyboard button (if your driver lets you), give it a keyboard shortcut (as a Service or with another app), or put it in your menu bar (with an app like FastScripts).\n\nA: ⌥+⇧+F11 and ⌥+⇧+F12 were restored in 10.7.4.\n\nA: To get much finer sound volume control I use soundflower from http://code.google.com/p/soundflower/. You have to restart after installing it. Then go to preferences/sound/output and choose soundflower(2ch). Start soundflower from the applications folder, click on the flower symbol in the top pannel and soundflower(2ch) built in output. Then go to Audio setup and change the master for soundflower(2ch). This way you can get the global sound less loud or you can amplify it. \n\nA: There's also a way to make the volume decrease in 1/4 steps by default. There's a tool you can install called Karabiner, and it already has this logic built in. \nSo just install it, open the preferences, search for fine grained volume controls, click it, and bam! It just works. What's great is that it switches it so the typical fine-grained keyboard command is now used for large volume steps, and just pressing the volume key will increase/decrease it by a 1/4 step. \nhttps://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en\n\nA: You can also change the output volume exactly as a percentage (for example 20%) with the terminal via Apple Script.\nosascript -e 'set volume output volume 20'\n\n", "Q: Have to reconnect to WiFi every time computer goes to sleep I recently purchased a new MacBook Air (2011) with Lion preinstalled. There is this persistent and incredibly annoying problem that is occurring with the WiFi. Every time I close the lid or let the computer go to sleep, and then begin reusing it, the popup comes up asking me to select a network to join. IT remembers the password, it just wont connect me until I chose a network. This happens every time. Things I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting computer\n\n*Turning WiFi on and then off\n\n*Changing encryption of the wireless (even though it happens to all wireless networks)\n\n\nHas anyone else discovered this problem? Has anyone found a fix for it? Or is it just a bug with Lion that hasn't been fixed yet?\n\nA: I had the same issue with my 2011 MacBook Air with Lion, and I think it had to do with having changed security preferences on my preferred wireless network. I went to System Preferences > Network > Advanced > WiFi and deleted all existing Preferred Networks, then re-added them. So far, so good. It joins my preferred network automatically after awakening from sleep mode.\n\nA: Bluetooth interference can cause this. Try turning off the Bluetooth via System Preferences and see if the problem goes away.\nIf that is the problem, the only solution I know is a) stop using bluetooth or b) change your wifi frequency to 5GHz.\nThis is a rare example of a design-fault in the MacBook line, all metal models seem to suffer from it.\n\nA: Check your network settings. If you're using DHCP with manual address, change it to just plain DHCP and see if that fixes it. I've read reports of people with similar problems resolving it this way\n\nA: I was having the same issue on my mid-2009 MacBook Pro. None of the answers or tips mentioned here seemed to do anything for me... but I did find a thread here that suggested resetting the SMC. I did so, following these instructions, and the problem seems to be fixed.\n\nA: Following is a solution that costs money, but will actually work.  The above solutions from other posts appear to work, but ultimately every one of them I tested, some of which initially appeared to work, but ultimately the issue returned within a day or hours.\nI can confirm that if you have an AT&T 2WIRE wireless router (which is required with Uverse, and various models of Apple laptops (MB, MB Air, MB Pro) with 10.6 or 10.7, that this issue occurs (unable to reconnect).\nOne week later, I can confirm a sustained solution, which is to purchase an Apple wireless router (ex: Airport Extreme), wire it into one of the LAN ports on the existing router, turn off wireless on the existing (2WIRE in my case) router, configure the Apple router in bridge mode.\nThis was a complete fix for all of the laptops we have.  I cancelled my order to Charter to replace uVerse.\n\nA: When this happens to me, it just means I need to add the network to my list of Preferred networks. Here's how:\nOpen System Preferences-> Network-> Wifi-> Advanced-> Wi-Fi. Click the [+] button under the Preferred Networks list. Click Choose a network... and select the one you want to connect to automatically.\nWhile you're there, it's a good idea to remove networks that you no longer need from that list.\n", "Q: How can I rip DVD subtitles to SRT format (or something else that iPads can understand)? Title says it all. I've used HandBrake, Subler, VideoMonkey, and RipIt. I'm familiar with mencoder. None of them seem to be able to rip the subtitles from a DVD and then get the soft subtitles to the iPad.\n\nA: Subler on Mac also can use OCR to convert bitmap subtitle tracks to SRT/closed-caption style softtracks.\nMake sure to rip the movie in Handbrake with whatever subtitles you like and do not BURN IN the subtitles.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new file in Subler and drag the movie containing the bitmap subtitles to it. When given the option, only import the bitmap subtitle tracks, not the whole movie.\n\n*Save the new file - Subler will convert the bitmap to a soft caption track. (This will be really slow if you added the whole movie, which is why I suggested just the subtitles in step 1).\n\n*Open your movie in Subler and drag the new file (containing the converted subtitles) into it. Import the track and it will appear as SRT/text subtitles. Set the language and save.\nI do like to burn in the Foreign Subtitles though, since those are often not included in the closed captions for the deaf/impaired but rather part of the bitmap subtitle tracks.\n\nA: Please, keep in mind that usually DVD subtitles are just bitmaps (pictures), so it won't be very straightforward.\nYou basically have 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use something like SubRip to extract the subtitles and convert them to SRT. Here's a nice guide on the subject: https://web.archive.org/web/20120224190445/http://www.dvd-guides.com/content/view/231/59/\nThen import the SRT into handbrake.\n\n*Download an SRT with the subtitles you want from someplace like opensubtitles.org and import the SRT into handbrake.\n\n\nA: This is by no means a complete answer but if the DVD you are ripping contains Closed Captioning subtitles then HandBrake gets you this for free.\nSimply add the subtitles as a track. You'll be able to clearly see what must be burned in and what doesn't have to be by the options that have been greyed out.\n\n\nI actually really like this option and use it whenever I can because different software can display these subtitles in different formats and all of the Apple playback software that I've used does a really nice job of displaying it readably and beautifully. I should also note that unchecking the Burned In check box won't make any difference on an iPad.\nThe problem is with bitmap subtitles. Essentially, I have found no software that can preserve alpha transparency when they rip bitmap subtitles and thus they require burn in to the resultant file if you want to use them directly in any Apple playback software. If you want to go this route, I have enough space to simply rip it twice, once with subtitles and once without.\nWhat you're left with is a variety of OCR techniques that are shoddy at best as far as what I've seen on the Mac. I have heard good things about SubRip if you have any access to Windows.\nAnother option is to download an open SRT file and add it manually to the container. You could search for these via traditional means or give opensubtitles.org a try. YMMV. As long as the container format you're ripping to is mp4 (it should be if you're ripping for Apple devices), you can use Subler to add the external SRT track in post.\n\nA: D-subtitler will extract and recognize subtitles to create an SRT file. It will require some work from your part for ambiguities, since it is an OCR, but you will get a clean SRT file instead of an image track.\nHowever, you would probably be better off starting by checking OpenSubtitles first to see if your file is not already there. Subdownloader is supposed to give you an easier (automated) access to it, but I did never care enough to try it, so I cannot guarantee it is as useful as it pretends to be  ;)\n\nA: You can use MakeMKV. There is a version for Mac OS.\n\nA: I try to use the free DVD Ripper software Handbrake or Avidemux to extract SRT subtitles from DVD movies, but both of them only allows me to rip the DVD file with the subtitles encoded in the video. But what I really want to do is only ripping the subtitles and not the video. Then, I find a paid application called Pavtube ByteCopy, it is quite simple to use with a friendly GUI interface, I use the program to successfully to extract the SRT file not only from DVD movies but alsoBlu-ray movies.\n\n", "Q: How to always show menubar with fullscreen apps? Does anyone know if it is possible to keep the menubar in Mac OS Lion visible for fullscreen apps instead of hidden until hovered over with a mouse or trackpad? \nI imagine there's some Terminal command I can enter to adjust this preference.\n\nA: You can adjust this on a per-app basis by editing the plist. My memory is rusty but here are instructions, if I remember correctly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Show package contents for the app you want\n\n*Edit the file Contents/info.plist\n\n*Search for \"LSUIPresentationMode\" (you may want to use a plist editor). It will look like this if you use a regular text editor:\n<key>LSUIPresentationMode</key>\n<integer>4</integer>\n\nIf the property does not exist, then you can create it - it must be inserted in the correct alphabetical order.\n\n*Change the value of the integer accordingly:\n\n\n*\n\n*LSUI PresentationMode 0 - Does not hide Dock or Menu Bar.\n\n*LSUIPresentationMode 1 - Hides Dock. Dock will appear if mouse moved to where it is located. Menu Bar will remain.\n\n*LSUIPresentationMode 2 - Removes Dock. Menu Bar will remain.\n\n*LSUIPresentationMode 3 - Removes Menu Bar and Dock.\n\n*LSUIPresentationMode 4 - Hides Menu Bar and Dock.

I first maximized the app (I was using Safari). Then, if you move your mouse to the top of the screen, the menu bar will appear, and you will see a little icon on the top right hand side (it's the \"opposite\" if you will of the maximize button). It looks like two little arrows pointing at each other. Click this. The app will fix itself to where the dock and menu bar are visible. \n\nA: I found a way to reveal the dock when in fullscreen mode, however i didn't find a way to permanently show the menu bar, sorry.\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110723181230680\n\nA: easy! just go to your dock (i cant do this for the menu bar btw) and go to the black line between the trash bin and an app,right click and click \"Turn Hiding Off\" and tada! its done hope this helps!\n", "Q: Why does Xcode 4.1 installation ask me to close iTunes when it isn't open? I am trying to install xcode 4.1 with lion. Apparently at 3/4 of the installation problem, it says to close itunes, which is not open. How can I fix the problem?\n\nA: Use Activity Monitor, and locate the iTunes Helper process and kill it. As per an Apple support discussion and several other sources.\nUpdate: The latest Xcode installer has been fixed and this should not be an issue now.\n\nA: There is also a bug in the Install Xcode 4.1 in regard to detecting that iTunes Helper is running. This has been fixed with Install Xcode 4.1.1 which you can get as a delta Update from the Mac AppStore.\n\nA: I encountered this problem with Xcode as well. The solution I found was that iTunes was open in another account. iTunes must be quit in all acounts to complete the installation. Also make sure that you quit iTunes(command q)not just close all the windows. Those are the two most likely reasons for that error message.\n", "Q: Where are all these ipfw rules coming from?

To be fair, I installed the first time before the supplemental 10.6.8 patches, maybe its a finicky upgrade path. Who knows...\n\nA: Mac OS isnt quite like Windows or Linux in that aspect, you cant run a \"bare bones\" version of Lion, nor a \"Starter\" version. Mac OS X Lion comes in a single version with all features.\nAs of minimum system requirements, Apple is pretty straight forward with that too. You need a mac with Intel Core 2 Duo at least. You also need 2GB of RAM, but I'd say most macs with a Core 2 Duo already have that covered. If not you can upgrade your memory. \nTo check your hardware click on the Apple Menu, select About This Mac, and then More Info.\nAs for apps, most apps just require you to be running a certain OS. Usually just games or heavy professional apps require minimum processor speeds/RAM memory.\nFor more info on Lion's Specs, go ahead and check:\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/specs.html\nHope its useful. \nKevin\n", "Q: What variable in the operating system determines the fans in OS X? Right now my fans have been spinning for a couple of hours.\nHowever, the cpu usage is low, nothing seems to be running, spotlight is not indexing, all the diagnostics i can think of tell me not much is happening except i have a few connections open.  \nI know the fans turn on because of heat, and indeed the heat is high on my laptop right now.  Yet, I don't see an actual cause for this.  What am I missing in my search?\n\nA: You might want to download Temperature Monitor (free). It will help determine which part of your system is hot (CPU? GPU?), and when things warm up.\nI also recommend you investigate your logs using Console (found in your Applications/Utilities folder) to see if there are any unusual errors which seem to correspond with the temperature spikes.\nI would shut down, let it cool off, and observe the logs/temperature after restart to see when the fans kick in again.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Does downloading torrents to an AirDisk affect my internal SSD? I gathered that it's not recommended to download torrents using an SSD (due to the high number of write operations, the SSD will be worn out pretty fast).\nI've changed to an AirDisk connected through my Airport Extreme for downloading torrents (uTorrent for Mac). Does this wear out the SSD on my MacBook Pro?\nThanks!\n\nA: Most torrent software will buffer files to local storage so you might not get it off the SSD even if you specify writing to an external space. Adding lots of RAM will allow files to stay in RAM while mapped in virtual memory and reduce the IO to the SSD on a theoretical level.\nIn pracice, I'd say get the SSD you like - it should have a 3-4 year OEM warranty or you can buy up AppleCare if you feel you have any chance of wearing out the drive. You'll have maybe spend a few $$ in exchange for driving your hot new mac. If you feel it will wear out soon, get a service plan that you like. It would be like not buying a new hot rod since you might need a new clutch if you drive it hard. You might, you might not, there's only one way to find out.\n\nA: It shouldn't, since none of the write operations are taking place on your SSD. Might bog down the network a bit, though.\n", "Q: Backing up Time Machine to an external disk also used by other machines - no sparsebundle? I moved to using an external disk (a Drobo) on 1 machine as a Time Machine backup for all of my machines. I've got 2 of the machines backing up perfectly, but the problem is with the machine that the drive is connected to.\nWhen I start the backup of the directly connected machine, Time Machine creates the folder structure /Backups.backupdb/[computer name]/ instead of just creating another sparsebundle file.\nShould I care? If yes, then how do I make Time Machine create a sparsebundle?\n\nA: The sparsebundle is how Time Machine backs up using the network method. The Backups.backupdb method is how it backs up when the drive is hooked up locally therefore you can't make it create a sparse bundle if its connected locally because that's the way time machine works. If you want it to make a sparse bundle you have to backup through a network. It should not make a difference to you since you'll be accessing it through time machine without having to worry about files etc.\n", "Q: How to prevent Finder windows from automatically popping up when I attach a disk? I have a removable Firewire drive.  It has several partitions, many of which have Mac OS installers on them (I'm a developer/sysadmin, and need to reinstall fairly frequently).  However, I also use this disk for backup and storage, so I don't want to install an operating system every time I attach it.\nWhenever I attach the drive, Finder pops up a couple windows automatically, offering to install the operating system.  I'd prefer that Finder not pop up these windows.\nWhy do only some of the partitions pop up windows?  How can I disable it altogether?\n\nA: Apparently it is set in the HFS+ filesystem header. I found some technical detail here, including C source to modify it.\n\nThe idea is to set word 2 of the finder info field in the HFS+ volume\n  header. The Mac OS 9/X Finders know to open a window corresponding to\n  the dirID stored in this field.\n\nAnd there's an ancient app to set it here.\nFor a tool to read the volume header check out fileXray (non free.) Its manual shows the location of the relevant flag on page 170, it looks like :\n# Open folder ID\n         finderInfo[2] = 0\n\nIf you're also using these disks for backups you probably aren't going to want to mess with the filesystem header, certainly not with the outdated tools above.\n\nA: The folder to open is controlled in a special field in the filesystem header. You can change this entry using the bless command as described in this source.\nTo review the current settings, use the following command:\nbless --info /Volumes/Any Disk/\n\nYou can change which folder of the mounted volume is opened in Finder on mount:\nsudo bless --folder \"/Volumes/Any Disk/\" --openfolder \"/Volumes/Any Disk/Documentation\"\n\nYou can reset the information completely as well:\nsudo bless --unbless /Volumes/Any Disk/\n\nNote that using these bless commands make the volume unbootable, so be careful if you need this. Of course, they also do not work for volumes with a read-only filesystem/medium, such as a CD/DVD.\n\nA: To prevent a volume from opening in finder when mounted run the bless command like so:\nsudo bless -folder \"/Volumes/volumename\"/\n\n", "Q: Can I play Warcraft 3 (DotA) on a Mac? I owned a MacBook Pro. I want to play a PC game called WarCraft 3 (with the DotA mod). I have Google and done some research on how to play DotA on the Mac. I can think of three possibilities:\nPossibility 1: Buy Warcraft 3 for Mac (it does exist). However, I already own the PC version, and I dont want to waste another $60++ bucks to buy the Mac version (it's an old game). \nThus, I come across some forums suggesting using a VM or using Boot Camp to install Windows and play. This leads to\nPossibility 2: Using Boot Camp and install Windows. Well, it sounds good for me, but I've never doen it before and I'm afraid I'll crash or need to reformat my Mac when partitioning, and Apple also recommends keeping a backup for your Mac when using Boot Camp. I do not want to go through all these troublesome things, thus I do not prefer this method.\nPossiblility 3: Finally, using a virtual machine. I use VirtualBox, and already have a Windows XP install, running, that works perfectly fine. Now, I am wondering, if I install Warcraft into this virtual machine, and play the game ~5 hours a day, will it crash my Mac?\nI have a few general questions about running Warcraft 3 in a VirtualBox VM Windows XP on a MacBook Pro:\n1) Will the game lag, the video rendering, etc.?\n2) Most importantly, will it damage my Mac?\nIf you have other methods of playing DotA (Warcraft 3) on Mac other than what I mentioned above, please do share them.\n\nA: You can create an account at www.battle.net and then tie your Warcraft 3 CD to your account.\nOnce you have done this, you are free to download the client on Windows or Mac at any time.\nThere's no need to buy different copies :)\n\nA: Warcraft 3 cannot be installed in Mac OS X 10.7+ they no longer support the emulation framework necessary to run PowerPC applications.\nMore information can be found here.\nUPDATE:\nWarcraft 3 has been ported to work with Intel-based processors and can again be installed on modern Macs.\n\nA: You can download it directly from the app store for 9.99$. Have it in my computer and work perfectly.\n\nA: S3/lag - never tried VirtualBox for gaming, but Parallels works flawlessly with Direct X emulation.\nS3/damage - the only possible damage come to my mind is the overheating damage. My old macbook (white plastics) survived very looooong WordOfWarcraft play without damage.

Till Mac OS X Snow Leopard, pressing ⌘+H while using an application did two things...\n\n\n*\n\n*The application hid itself from view.\n\n*The application placed itself at the end of the ⌘+⇥ switcher.\n\n\nThe 2nd point was very useful, because when I hid an app, I knew I wasn't going to use it for some time. Sending it to the end of the switcher helped me focus on the apps I was using more.\nHowever, in Lion, even though ⌘+H hides the app, it only moves it to the next position in the switcher. This is equivalent to ⌘+⇥ing between 2 apps, except that the app is now also hidden from view. IMO, this breaks a fundamental feature of the switcher and the app-hiding concept. I have no idea why this was done.\nDoes anyone have clues on how, if at all, this could be fixed? Or maybe places I should start looking? I just hope there's a preference buried in some plist file somewhere...\n\nA: This is a great question. This might be intended behavior rather than a bug. Mission Control seems to have blended both the old Expose and the old Spaces. With that in mind, launching a new app Full Screen places it on its own desktop. When you get to Mission Control you see it placed to the right of the original, empty Desktop. Open a second app Full Screen and that will place it again on its own desktop, next to the first Full Screen app you opened. \nJust like the Home Screens in iOS and the old Spaces, it would seem that Apple intends these desktops to stay, space-wise, in the same place. Mail is \"to the left\" of Safari if I opened Safari after opening Mail. I agree that this spatial notion collides with our pre-conceived understanding of the switcher. That is same reason why hiding is disabled for Full Screen apps (pressing ⌘+H will not hide a Full Screen app). \nIf everything is full screen, the concept of hiding becomes less relevant. I think back to the older versions of Mac OS, where you had stacks upon stacks of windows. Hiding an app like Adobe Photoshop (and all of its many opened child windows for each one of my many opened images) made sense. If such window \"stacking\" is spatially not there (because those Full Screen apps are now side-by-side, they're not really stacked) then it almost makes sense that it doesn't work. \nHaving said all of that, I could not agree more that Lion has completely messed around with the workflow of many old-time Mac users. I do not necessarily agree with Apple's decisions here, I am just trying to play advocate and see if this one in particular has some explanation that makes sense. Hope this helps. \nUpdate: \nThis article at TidBITS mentions a new feature in Lion called Automatic Termination. I was not aware of this feature. I wonder if the behavior that is being experienced by this question's author is related to this. \n\nA: As this has been bugging me ever since this was changed I've given it another go. It seems the only working way so far is to imitate it by switching to all open apps before hiding. \nNot sure if applescript changed a bit but I had to change willlma's script like this for it to work. This also has substantially less key presses so should do the job faster.\ndelay 0.5\nset i to 0\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set first_app to name of the first process whose frontmost is true\n    repeat with p in every process\n        if visible of p then\n            set i to i + 1\n        end if\n    end repeat\n    repeat i - 1 times\n        key down command\n        key down shift\n        keystroke tab\n        delay 0.01\n        key up shift\n        key up command\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n    set visible of process first_app to false\nend tell\n\nIt will show some flickering while switching and the delay can be too short if some animations take longer (like switching to full-screen apps), so the numbers are probably not optimal for all Macs or situations.\nAnd while it should be possible to set an Automator Service with a global hotkey, nothing happened for me.

What is the typical lifespan one can expect?\n\nA: MacBook Airs ship with either Toshiba or Samsung MLC SSD drives.\nNo SSD drives are fail-safe.\nLifespan of an SSD drive depends on what wear levelling techniques are employed by the manufacturer and the operating system and what exactly a user does with his/her computer. There is no reliable figure.\nMy own view with SSDs (as it has been with hard drives) is prepare for the worst and backup regularly. Take advantage of the manufacturer's warranty should a drive fail.\n\nA: I used to build all my PCs myself for the past 20 years and tried many brands of every computer part possible, all price range (from cheapest to hardcore gaming rigs) and my experience with hard drives in general is that some brands just DO fail much more than others. Back in the days, i had horrible experience with Western digital, IBM, Maxtor (was the worst), etc. The really good ones i had were all Seagate.\nSo when i saw that SDD came in an acceptable price range and apparently \"more reliable\", i decided to give them a try. Not wanting to waste any time with unreliable parts, i went for the more expansive, usually never-break brand \"Intel\" and bought a 128 gb intel SSD. It lasted exactly 2 weeks before dying without giving me ANY chance to see it coming or do a backup (usually, you can hear HDD fail weeks before they give up because they do a clicking noise). I was really pissed, since they were still expensive.\n3 years ago, i started using PCs + Macs and i bought a macbook air  11\" 2011. I've had many friends and \"friends of friends\" that had problems with their Mac laptop saying the motherboard or hard drive failed often, mostly JUST out of warranty so i was really worried about them dying on me. But i still chose to buy one since Mac laptop are just so much superior to PCs laptops (internet, trackpad, battery, mostly). And honestly i loved the thing. Until the SSD died 12 months, 15 days after i bought it, or 15 days out of warranty. I was pissed. Exactly what i feared happened had happened.\nThe thing is they really insist on you buying (expensive) extended warranties for mac and i always found that really fishy. But anyway, i got used to working with the thing so i updated it for a macbook air 2012 model, 13\" this time.\nAnd..... just this morning, it happened again. After only 10 months of use, the SSD died on me, again. This time in warranty. So this is 3 on 3 SSD that died before 1 year and i'm getting pretty pissed about it. \nThe thing is, SSD are the future, they'll fix the reliability issues and they are so much snapier and faster than normal HDD that you should still buy one. \nSo here's my recommendation: if you have a Mac, get yourself a TimeMAchine & Dropbox software. It's the single best invention in the world. Timemachine will back up your computer every hour automatically on a remote HDD. So when i got my SSD replaced this morning, i came back home and just restored from timemachine backup and im back running like nothing else happened.\nhope this help\n", "Q: Why is Wine X11 not creating a window on my Mac?

It is available on the OS X install CD.\n\nA: See this SuperUser question DISPLAY on OSX is not 0.0 . It is set by the startup and you should not set the variable manually.\n", "Q: Is File Vault 2 whole disk encryption or whole partition encryption? Can I use File Vault to encrypt only some of the partitions on my disk (so that I can still have unencrypted and Windows partitions on the same disk), or does File Vault encrypt the whole disk so that you cannot even get to the partition table without decrypting it?\nAnd if not, is there any support for reading File Vault disks on Windows, Linux, or, for that matter, Snow Leopard ? \n\nA: Yes. FileVault2 is volume based so you can have an encrypted Mac OS volume and an unencrypted Windows bootcamp partition for instance. The Recovery partition is also not encrypted.\nFileVault2 requires Lion to decrypt/decode the drive. It doesn't work with Windows Linux, or previous versions of Mac OS X. I recommend John Siracusa's Lion review for more detail. You can also listen to his 5by5 podcast for some additional insights.\n\nA: John Siracusa's detailed Lion review covers the new FileVault disk encryption feature in great detail:\nhttp://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/13#lion-file-system\nTo summarise, the new system is \"volume\" based. This means that not all volumes can be or are encrypted. The Lion recovery partition for example is not encrypted. Non Mac volumes are also not encrypted (FAT, NTFS, ExFAT, etc).\nFrom John's description it does appear you can have multiple encrypted volumes. Whether or not they can use different passwords is unknown to me. Some use of the diskutil command may be necessary to achieve this if possible.\n", "Q: What are the legal implications of Jailbreaking an iOS device? I am forced to Jailbreak an iPad so that I can deploy a custom application for a client. This is an application that no one can have but him, so basically jailbreaking is the only choice I have?\nI can't even install the app as a demo through the provisioning profile because that expires I think in 1 year?\nWhat legal implications, in various jurisdictions, are there for jailbreaking an iOS device?\n\nA: You can use a provisioning profile as long as he gets a new provisioning profile before the current one expires.\nApple also has a business store (basically a corporate App Store) but I think that is way over the top for what you are trying to do.\nThe most legitimate/safe option is to deploy a provisioning file and update it each year…\n", "Q: Which OS X Lion features would not be available on a late 2008 MacBook model? Which OS X Lion features wouldn't work on a late 2008 MacBook?  The system in question has a 2.1GHz Core 2 Duo CPU and has been upgraded to 4GB RAM and a 500GB hard drive, so it meets the hardware requirements.  (Oh, and the MacBook is white.  ;-)\nAm I right in thinking the only major thing not supported would be the lack of some multi-touch gesture functionality, assuming no external trackpad is attached?\nOr, is there something else I'm missing?  Thanks.\n\nA: I think your MacBook should support all of Lions features except the gestures as you mentioned. I checked using MacTracker and your MacBook doesn't support the multitouch so you will not be able to use some of the more complex three and four finger gestures.\nThe only other feature I questioned was Airdrop but a quick search found that Airdrop is supported.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: I've got a similar model to yours (black one, same age).\nLion runs fine on it, and all the features work except for multitouch.\nYou get two finger scroll, but that's about it. It's basically like having a mouse attached.\nThat said, I don't think there are any functions that require multitouch; they all have keyboard/mouse equivalents.\nThe performance is good (about the same as 10.6), and the screen size isn't a problem.\nGo ahead and install; it's a worthwhile upgrade for sure.\n\nA: Internet Recovery comes to mind as a notable features you will miss on Lion. (in addition to your lack of a multi touch trackpad surface) It looks like late 2008 is the cutoff for being included in the AirDrop armada - which is great for you. You will get a Recovery HD which should download Lion from the internet if you need to restore, but your mac won't be able to network boot from Apple's servers if the internal drive unpartitioned or otherwise without a recovery partition.\n", "Q: MenuBar doesn't show up in full screen mode I'm trying to use the full screen mode in Lion, but I can't get the menubar to show up at all.  I push my cursor up to the top of the screen, wait a second, and nothing.  Some apps will seem like they're trying to do something (e.g., Safari will change what's visible in the toolbar), but in no case does the menubar actually appear.  Needless to say, I really effectively can't use full screen mode this way.  Any suggestions on how to get the menubar to show up?\n\nA: This was a known issue.\nPlease download the 10.7.2 OS X Lion update (Apple Menu > Software Update).\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4767\n\nThe OS X Lion v10.7.2 Update includes Safari 5.1.1 as well as fixes that:\n...\nAddress an issue that may cause the menu bar to not appear in full screen apps.\n...\n\n\nA: If you need to force the Menu Bar to show up whilst in a fullscreen app, you can use the keyboard shortcut ^F2 (Ctrl+Fn+F2) to manually show/hide.\n\nA: From what I've experienced, I think there is an intermittent bug that Apple needs to fix in an update. Sometimes, the menu bar just doesn't appear when you move the mouse to the top of the screen.\nThere are two workarounds that I'm using at the moment:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've found that taking another application into full-screen mode can get things working again, but this doesn't always work consistently.\n\n*You can of course use the keyboard shortcut (Control + Command + F) to exit full-screen, but this obviously doesn't help you to access the application's menus while in full-screen mode.\n\n", "Q: How to select multiple app icons in Launchpad to move them? Is it possible to select more than one app icon at a time in Launchpad and then drag them to a folder?\n\nA: Multiple selection is not implemented in LaunchPad. A work around: Drag individual icons into a folder (to make the first folder drag an icon over another and drop). Then move the folder to the new location and unpack it.\n\nA: This kind of operation doesn't seem to be available. Based on how the interaction between the waggling icons and the gui is, I don't even think it would be possible with a reasonable usability. \nApple has chosen to reproduce the same feel as it is on iOS devices so that everybody familiar with that - extremely easy, btw - workflow can achieve the same in Lion.\n", "Q: Can You Stop the Migration Assistant Midway Through? Can the Migration Assistant be stopped midway through? I began the wireless transfer from a Mac Mini to a new MacBook Air last night. It still says it's going to take 40 hours. Unfortunately, I can't wait that long, and the process is taking up both of my computers. \nIn case of catastrophic failure what recourse do I have, as the MacBook Air doesn't have a system restore disk?\n\nA: Pressing Command + Q on both machines will exit the migration assistant.\nI have a feeling that it copies all files to temporary location before installing them/creating user accounts. So you should be fine. Depending on how far in you might have problems.\n\nA: The obvious answer is the migration is not supposed to be stopped, but you might disable the network or otherwise halt the machine that is sending the data.\nIt should be fine since it's just sending data.\nThe receiving mac might handle the interruption well or not. Something was working on the mac to start the migration assistant - so you should be able to get back to that state fairly easily.\nThere are specific steps to clean up based on what part of the transfer was in progress.\nSafest is to go back to a sane backup and attempt migration again with a faster connection or more time.\nPost what happens here or as a follow on question - it's pretty easy to clean up the user accounts if they are the part that got interrupted (instead of apps, system settings, or random non-user files being transferred)\nHalf a user is usually what you end up with and that's not good in general.\n\nA: I would just stop the process , format the disk, reinstall lion , and migrade using some other method.(Format and Reinstall should take like 40 mins since Lion is downloaded). If you don't have a TM backup disk and need to do it over wifi you can connect the machines to the router using ethernet cable that should probably speed up the process quite much. \n", "Q: How can I re-map Mail's \"Sent Messages\" folder to an IMAP server's \"Sent Mail\" folder? I use Mail to connect to a traditional IMAP server (non-Gmail). I've noticed that all the messages I send are placed in Mail's \"Sent\" folder and that Mail is translating this folder to a server folder called \"Sent Messages\". The problem is that on the IMAP server, the real folder meant to store sent messages is called \"Sent Mail\". \nI occasionally send messages using the server's web interface. Because of this, over time I will have my sent messages spread out over \"Sent Messages\" and \"Sent Mail\" in the server. If I want to find a sent message, and because these messages are not consolidated, I now have two places I need to search thru. \nMy iPhone does map its \"Sent\" folder to the real \"Sent Items\" folder, so both the messages I send on the web interface and on my iPhone are stored in the right place. How can I get Lion's Mail app to play along? I am not entirely sure if this same problem was already present in Snow Leopard. \nI cannot seem to find the setting that will allow me to re-map IMAP folder in Mail. I think I recall previous versions of Mail having such an option, although I am not 100% sure that the option even existed. I don't think it matters, but I am using the Lion GM--which should be basically the same as the release version. \nUpdate\nI've been suggested to use the \"Use This Mailbox For\" option. That feature will take a local folder and re-purpose it. So, I could take my LOCAL COPY of Sent Items found in the local IMAP mailbox and say \"Use this mailbox for... Sent\". I did just that, but what happened is that the local copy of Sent Items disappeared (bug?) and when I send a message on Mail, that message still goes to Mail's default Sent folder--which in turn re-creates the Sent Messages folder in the server containing the message I just sent. \nIt seems that whatever goes into the local \"Sent\", gets mapped to a server folder called \"Sent Messages\" (and the IMAP server's web interface confirms a new \"Sent Messages\" gets created every time, even if I delete it). That is why I still need to re-map the local \"Sent\" and NOT the local \"Sent Items\". \nUpdate #2\nAfter I restarted Mail (which I had not done) I found out that Sent is now mapped to the server's Sent Items folder and that was the reason Sent Items disappeared locally. The IMAP server's web interface does no longer show the Sent Messages and all messages sent by Mail are now stored in Sent Items, just like the iPhone does. I have marked the answer by @mwidmann as the correct one. Thanks!\n\nA: Have you tried selecting the folder in the folder list and then using the menu entry \"Use This Mailbox For -> Sent\" in the Mailbox menu?\n!\nThat should do exactly what you want.\n", "Q: How can I install an SSD on my new Lion MBP w/out install disks? I just got a new MBP that came with Lion, and they didn't give me any install disks.  If I  swap in my new SSD, how can I install Lion on the new drive?\nUpdate: There is the Mac OS X Utilities that I can get to by holding Command+R during a restart, which has options to install Lion and/or erase/fix a disk.  Additionally, the instruction manual I received gives instructions on how to replace the computer's hard drive, so it seems that Apple would account for setting up the new drive without a install-disk.  I missed the UPS delivery of my new SSD, so will have to wait until Monday, at which time I'll swap the drives, and see if this built-in utility works.  If not, I'll follow people's advice on mirroring the old disk over. Will reply back with result\nUpdate 2: Installed SSD, and of course it doesn't let me get access to the OS X Utilities (i.e. via Command+R).  This must be another partition on the drive.  I'm going to try mirroring the two drives.  A curse upon all these screws I have re-remove\n\nA: The recovery partition on your original disk was the only supported method until the Recovery Disk Assistant was made available.\n\nThe bulk of this answer was written before the official steps were published - so I would recommend the Recovery Disk Assistant even though HT4718 steps help understand what is happening under the hood.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718\nThe easiest is to get a drive enclosure or adapter and re-run the Lion installer from the Recovery HD and install Lion onto the new SSD.\nIt likely won't matter if the drive with the recovery HD is on an external bus or an internal bus, but I would keep the original drive inside the mac until you have Lion installed on your SSD connected to an external port.\nBoot off the SSD to test it and run migration from the internal drive to the SSD before doing swapping the drives inside your mac.\nIt still boggles my mind that any mac will ship without some sort of reinstall media. Look in the center of the box, under where the mac sat. Call apple if your media is missing so they can ship it to you or point out how they want you to reinstall the OS on a new drive. Your mac's hard drive is listed as a consumer replaceable part, so they have to provide you with the steps to do that. \n\nA: If you have one of the newest Macs (The most recently released Mac Mini or MacBook Air, and in the future all new Mac models) you can install Lion over the Internet by net booting from Apple's servers.\nSee Apple's Lion Recovery page.\n\nIf your Mac problem is a little less common — your hard drive has failed or you’ve installed a hard drive without OS X, for example — Internet Recovery takes over automatically. It downloads and starts Lion Recovery directly from Apple servers over a broadband Internet connection. And your Mac has access to the same Lion Recovery features online. Internet Recovery is built into every newly-released Mac starting with the Mac mini and MacBook Air.\n\nThis will work for all Macs with firmware 1.7\n\nA: Your best option is probably to get a hard drive dock or enclosure that you can use to plug the SSD in as an external drive. Then use SuperDuper or something similar to clone the HDD's contents to the SSD. Then swap the drives and boot as normal.\nI did this to put an SSD into my early 2009 17\" MacBook Pro with Snow Leopard and it worked fine. The only caveat is that it might interact strangely with Lion's recovery partition. Best to test that before you reclaim your slow HDD for mass storage.\nThe dock I use is a Newertech Voyager Q.  It's a bit expensive if this is all you need it for, but it's super handy for swapping out drives if you have high storage requirements or if you have a solid backup regimen. You also might get a small USB enclosure, which will be cheaper, and which will allow you to stick the slow HDD you're removing into it to use for mass storage from then on.\n\nA: Got the new Crucial M4 512GB, cloned original MACBOOK Pro (late 2011) drive using a SATA to USB connection and Carbon Copy Cloner. Removed the hard disk and installed the SSD in the drive bay. Ever so happy afterwards. Yet to put the original drive in to a caddy, waiting for Thunderbolt caddies to come out! :)\n\nA: Interestingly enough, there is no real way to do this. At least, there's no way to install Lion without the installer and since your computer came with Lion you don't have the installer and you also don't have Snow Leopard disks. If you're interested in transferring everything over anyways, go out and buy a disk enclosure, then use either Super Duper or Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the harddrive in your MacBook Pro over to the SSD and then proceed with the install. If you wanted to do a fresh Install, you might be able to actually do the install with the Recovery partition if it loads up the full installer giving you choice in which disk you install to, but no one has tried that yet.\n\nA: *\n\n*Online recovery won't work. Why? Because I changed the setup. The online recovery probably checks for your hardware, and if it doesn't match with serial number, it won't let you install Mac OS from the internet (obvious reason, I could be creating disks with free mac os for everyone). With original HDD, it works. With new SSD, it doesn't.\n\n*You can't boot from USB. No USB stick, no USB enclosure, no USB dvd drive. It doesn't boot from USB. Ever. It is a feature of MBP. Airs boot from USB just fine, because they don't have integrated DVD drive.\n\n*No boot from LAN\n\n*In my case, I took away the DVD drive, put in original 500gig HDD, and then I put new SSD to where the HDD was. (I did that with OptiBay). Now what's the procedure... It took me a month to figure that out, because I wanted Windows on the SSD, and Mac OSX on the HDD, which was in the optibay. And you can't boot from USB. Oh, also, you can't put SSD into the OptiBay, because the SATA port for DVD drive only works with HDD, but it won't see an SSD drive (I don't know why, that's just the way it is). So how you get a Windows in there?\nWell, I first installed Mac OSX onto HDD with original setup through online recovery. Both HDD and DVD drive on their place. Then I made the switch, HDD instead of DVD and SSD instead of HDD. You'll boot just fine holding the Option key. Then you use VirtualBox and use the whole SSD with direct access to allocate it as virtual drive. And then, through virtual box, you use Windows image to boot to installation and you let it copy the install files. Once it's done, I turned off the VirtualBox, rebooted to SSD and installed the rest of Windows. This procedure also includes NTFS driver for Mac OS which you need to have and rEFIt (these are needed to have OSX installed on a drive, that also serves as a data drive for Windows, so both systems with different partitioning approach use data from one physical hard drive), which will allow you to boot from both drives into different systems. I will write this one at the end, so you might miss reading it: Do not delete Apple partition, once you have Windows installed. Because you still need it to download Windows Drivers, which you CANNOT download ANYWHERE ELSE(maybe you can, the old ones, but I couldn't download the most recent windows drivers anywhere, not even on a torrents), but download them through the Boot Camp wizard, which is otherwise useless and won't work with Windows partitions installed on the drive, and also it tells you to put in the Windows DVD, which is a nonsense, because my DVD drive was no longer connected to the computer. You can't plug it through USB when you are in MacOS (so Boot Camp Assistant sees it), but the computer won't boot from it on reboot.\nDue to recent hard disk failure (HDD), I lost the partition with Mac OSX, and also it's recovery partition. With this setup, I will go to Apple Store and ask them to install Mac OSX to HDD, while preserving Windows in the main bay. If they can accomplish it, I have no problem paying the money for the system, if they tell me they can't do it, I'm selling it, and I'll buy a PC.\nIf you are just REPLACING the disk in your MBPRO, then you would be better off to go to a desktop PC, with Windows on it, get an app that can clone Mac partitions (they cost just few bucks, and believe me, it is worth the time, I have spent ages doing research on this and then actually using it, plug both drives into the computer (yes, uncover the side panel, get two sata cables, and connect them to the motherboard and to the drives, along with power cables), turn on the computer, and then use the software to do the actual copy of recovery partition of your original drive to your new drive. The Recovery partition has about 700MB, everything else you don't need, it will be created when MacOS installs. After you are done copying, put the SSD to your Apple Computer, and turn it on. That's it.\n", "Q: Any DvdFab/DvdShrink comparable program for Mac? I want to rip a dvd (and/or blu-ray) to an ISO, but remove some of the features on the disk (i.e. menus, extra features).  DvdFab and DvdShrink for Windows allow users to do this.  Any similar programs for Mac?\n\nA: RipIt is the best I've seen. You can try it free, it is paid software with a novel guarantee. If you can't rip a title, they will buy that title and fix their software for you.\n\nA: Yup, it's called Mac DVD Ripper Pro, it works great on my Snow Leopard MacBook Pro, and it's Lion-compatible according to the RoaringApps website. It costs $19.95 at the moment, and the free demo works on 5 DVDs, website is here:\nhttp://www.macdvdripperpro.com/\nFYI, the RoaringApps Lion app compatibility table is here:\nhttp://roaringapps.com/apps:table/\n\nA: How about HandBrake? \n", "Q: Make locator.updatedb run daily on Snow Leopard w/o hacking /System/Library? On Snow Leopard, the locate database is updated once a week by a launchd job, /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist. I'd like to make the updater run daily, but AFAIK it's considered very bad form to edit anything in /System.\nWhat's the best way to change its StartCalendarInterval so it runs once a day?\n\nA: The way I understand it, that System folder launchd job does nothing but execute /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb itself.\nSo simply create your own launchd job executing /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb that runs once a day.\nAs a sidenote, here's a Super User answer which recommends using mdfind -name <filename> instead of locate so that you can use the Spotlight database which is continually updated.\nAnd this Ask Different answer has more info on creating launchd jobs if you need more help with that.\n\nA: The problem with 'locate' and with Spotlight is that it doesn't search every file. It used to be possible to work-around this by updating the updatedb as root, which would warn you that was a potential security hole (i.e. anyone with read access to the database could get a list of every file in any user's $HOME) but since most Mac users are the only user on their computers, that was not a huge concern.\nI finally got so fed up that I wrote my own script which will:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a plain-text index of every file, link, and directory\n\n*search that index using egrep\n\n*offer to restrict searches to $HOME or the current directory if certain arguments are given\n\n*if nothing is found in the index, offer to update the index, or search with mdfind\nYou can download the script here [Dropbox link].

I've upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion, then I purchased and installed the Server from App Store.\nNow I'd like to remove the Server features, and revert to standard Lion.  I don't mind reinstalling, I don't want to reformat, or restore from backup.\nWhat is the most correct and complete process?\n\nA: Since the server component changes files and preferences, you can't easily undo those changes other than by a back up. There is no uninstall - and there are in general no way to undo any patch or upgrade - even between major revisions like 10.6.7 to 10.6.8.\nThe only sure way is to restore those settings and files that get changed from a backup or set things up after a totally clean installation.\nBoot into recovery, erase the volume and install Lion (without the server component) and you will have a correct and complete non server Lion. You can migrate data in from external drives, time machine (at any point in time) or make the set up new by hand.\nLion will not allow a simple re-install to \"undo\" the server changes as it's not programmed to do all that work in reverse.\n\nA: lsbom  -p F /var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.Server*.bom | perl -pi -e 's/\\.//'\n\nGives you the files installed by the Server packages, in double quotes, absolute paths.\n\nA: (Edited version)\nTo uninstall OS X Lion Server, it depends on the server state. If the server is not configured, one need only to delete the Server app from the Applications folder, and restart the machine.\n(I have tried this. It works except for one thing. In the AppStore, you will always get a notification when the server app can be updated.)\nIf the server has been configured, I can only point you to this apple support document:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4827\nPlease note that this article refers only to disabling Server, not removing it.\n\nA: Once you have configured the Server app it will download and install its components which are not deleted with the app.\nServer app is just an interface to these individual control modules similar to command line tools or like preferences items that plug into the server.app\nYou can use the above method to look for the files that the server.app downloaded but I doubt if you can straightaway delete them.\nThe Server.app once configured will mark your OS X Lion as OS X Lion Server and you will continue to receive server related update alerts even if you delete it.\n\n/System/Library/CoreServices/ServerVersion.plist\n\nThis file is created when you configure the server and OS X Lion will look for it while checking for the software updates.\nIf you delete this file OS will fallback to \"SystemVersion.plist\" in the same folder and your machine should be back to non server updates :)\n", "Q: Does buying a new mac also get you Lion on your Apple ID? When you buy a new mac, the iLife apps are redeemed with App Store validation codes which means you can upgrade/install iLife 11 on your other macs. (Assuming you have fewer than the current store limit of 5 macs connected to your store Apple ID and the software requirements are met).\nDoes this also apply to Lion? \nI would presume no since the linked MacWorld article clearly only mentions iLife. I'm mostly interested in how the App Store is working and this appears to be a new function where it's allowing a programatic access to an asset that also is being sold under the normal store terms of redemption code or direct payment.\n\nA: No. The copy of Lion you get with a new Mac is only available via the recovery partition on the hard drive and this version of the OS is tied to the hardware.\nFrom this MacWorld article that talks about how the version of iLife you get with a new Mac is a full Mac App Store version you can install on multiple Macs in your house:\n\nWhen you reinstall Lion via Lion Recovery, it seems Apple uses information about your Mac's hardware to verify that it has a license for Lion.\n\nOr as this summary of the MacWorld article puts it:\n\nUnfortunately, as Macworld points out, this trick doesn’t apply to OS X Lion itself — there’s no DVD or thumb drive included with a new Mac, which means the big cat only lives on your new Mac’s recovery partition, which appears to be tied to the hardware itself — meaning you can’t install it on your other Macs without ponying up the $29.99 from the Mac App Store.\n\nWould be nice if you got it for your other Macs for free when you bought a new Mac, but for now it seems like it'll still cost you another $30 to bring all the Macs you own up to the current OS rev.\n\nA: This is second-hand information via TUAW.com, and not personal experience, but anyway, according to TUAW, the OS X license bought with a machine is tied to the hardware and not transferable.\nSee:\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/29/dear-aunt-tuaw-if-i-sell-my-old-mac-does-lion-go-with-it/\nSo the answer to your question would be \"no\".\n", "Q: Special keyboard keys I have this applet made in java, which relies on the users keycode input.\nThe case is that I have to press \"Insert\" for a function, which doesn't exist on the keyboard. Another function requires the \"Page Up\", which is also missing from my keyboard.\nI have the BT Keyboard (no numpad).\nI did not make the applet and there are no options to change the keyboard-controls.\nHow can I send these 'keys' to the Java applet?\n\nA: The page up Key is mapped to fn + Arrow UP. \nOther key combinations with fn and the arrow keys are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Arrow down > page down\n\n*Arrow left > beginning of line or begin of page depending on situation\n\n*Arrow right > end of line or bottom of page depending on situation\n\n\nFor the Insert Key there's no correspondant key on a Mac keyboard, but you could try using the fn + Enter which I found here. I can't confirm this though as I absolutely have no idea where I could test this out. \n\nA: On that keyboard, the Page-Up key code can be sent by pressing:\nfn+↑\nThis can be found by turning on the Keyboard Viewer in System Preferences -> Language and Text -> Input Sources.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get the keyboard viewer to show a full keyboard when a bluetooth keyboard is connected? From time to time I want to simulate having a full keyboard even though my Mac uses the smaller Apple bluetooth keyboard. It is most important for the system events to get the actual key pressed as much as possible and not just find another shortcut that maps to the same action once it hits the OS.\nI had hoped to use (or better trick) the supplied keyboard viewer, but the OS \"cleverly\" shows me the layout I have instead of the layout I want.\n\nCan anyone help me trick my software into showing the larger keyboard like this without having one physically plugged in? It's nice to have fast access to the keys including/under F13-F15 and the key pad enter only key from time to time without plugging in more hardware. It's also nice to make tutorials that show the full key layout.\n\n\nA: Apple has a pretty good record on accessibility features, one of which is the onscreen keyboard. I would be surprised if there is not a way to do enable the extended onscreen keyboard, but I'm still researching where this precise bit of how-to knowledge.\nIn the meantime, here is Apple's official page for accessibility features related to Physical and Motor Skills (which is the category for the Onscreen Keyboard): http://www.apple.com/accessibility/macosx/physical.html\nIt shows the extended version in their screenshot.\nThis is overkill (both in features and price), but I felt the need to add the application called \"the best on-screen keyboard, not just for the Macintosh, but for any platform.\"\nI'm too new to have lots of links. but look at atri.misericordia.edu for a review of KeyStrokes.\nHere: have a layout editor, so if you can't see the keys you need in Keyboard Viewer, you can switch them in to replace some keys you don't really care about:\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=ukelele\nstill doing research, will be adding what I find\n\nA: I found that if you have an Apple Extended Keyboard, that keyboard is automatically used in the display of the keyboard viewer. I have it plugged into my MacBook, which is usually on a stand. When I switch between keyboards, the built-in keyboard viewer automatically uses the right layout.\nSo the short (though perhaps expensive) solution to this is to simply plug in an Apple Extended Keyboard if you want to see the whole keyboard in the viewer as well.\nHere's a 2 second screencast of the live swapping in action, as I switch between the built-in keyboard and the external one.\n\nThis also works with non-Apple extended-format keyboards (tested with Microsoft-brand extended keyboard).\n\nA: Virtual Keyboard from http://www.corallosoftware.it/index.html looks good. It's shareware with a 14 day trial and can be downloaded here as well.\n\nA: I have a full size bluetooth keyboard and when I open the keyboard viewer I see the full keyboard that you are looking for.\nThe keyboard viewer was probably intended to help people find special characters that aren't displayed on the keys of the keyboard they have in front of them. This is especially helpful when trying to type in a foreign language when using a US keyboard, for example.\nUnfortunately my Rocketfish keyboard doesn't connect as faithfully and simply as my Apple bluetooth keyboard. :(\n\nA: I have the smaller Apple bluetooth keyboard also and if I press \"shift\" on it then the onscreen keyboard viewer shows the numbers key pad.\n\nA: There's always been an option to choose what type of bluetooth keyboard you have.  When you connect a USB keyboard, the OS asks you to press the key next to shift and based on the key code it receives it autoselects the board.  if you click a random key like a number the computer wont be able to auto select.  \nIN that case if the detection fails,  you are given choices and must pick yourself which keyboard layout you want. Choose the largest to cover the most possibilities as it has no idea what you have.  Some aftermarket keyboards still register as smaller ones because it spoofs the USB id and pretends to be a genuine part.  \nTL:DR go to preferences and set up bluetooth keyboard type.  Here's the ey if auto selection fails, don't follow the instructions and just press random keys.  This interrupts auto selection and you can pick what kind of board you know you have over what the USB hardware selects.\n\nA: If anyone is still interested in an answer all these many years later, if your keyboard happens to have keys not currently implemented in the basic keyboard, clicking them will tell the OS that it has incorrectly selected the keyboard to display, and swap the onscreen keyboard to the extended layout automatically.\nThis even occurs for keys Apple does not even implement (like the \"Tools\" key on my Samsung Bluetooth keyboard, that has no equivalent on the Mac, displays nothing on the onscreen keyboard, but still causes the onscreen keyboard layout to swap to the extended layout when clicked.\n(There is no way to switch it back, however, other than closing the keyboard viewer then reopening it.)\n\nA: As far as I know I don't believe this is possible. However some bright spark may be able to find some plist hack to do precisely what you are looking for. As a less bright spark I can perhaps offer a partial workaround for the function you are attempting to achieve.\ncmd + up arrow takes you to the beginning of a document.\ncmd + down arrow takes you to the end of a document.\ncmd/ctrl + left arrow takes you to the beginning of a line.\ncmd/ctrl + right arrow takes you to the end of a line.\nfn + backspace is \"delete\"\nfn + up arrow is \"page up\"\nfn + down arrow is \"page down\"\nI'm not familiar with the wired keyboard but from pictures those seem to be the buttons you were asking about. Learn those and it'll be faster than the onscreen one anyway!\nI've never had cause to use it but the specific \"enter only\" key may be a type of special character. If that is the case then it seems to me you may be able to assign it a keyboard shortcut using an AppleScript in Automator, which can be saved as a Service and assigned a shortcut from the keyboard menu. If anyone has a more efficient way of assigning a keyboard shortcut to an awkward character (unicode or otherwise) I'd be interested to hear it (as a linguist!).\n", "Q: Upgrading to Lion from Snow Leopard I really want to upgrade to Lion, however I have some concerns with upgrading an OS, believe me, upgrading OS is far too scary for me, anyway, I just read on upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion, now I want to understand what I have to do, can I just download Lion from the App Store then just open it, which will install Lion. \nThe part that gets me, when installing/upgrading, will my files on Snow Leopard be intact, because I have so much to transfer if I were to upgrade. I have no external HDD which I'm thinking of buying soon.\nAll I need is some piece of advice and explanation what goes on in the installation/upgrading process.\nThanks!\nEDIT:\nJust upgraded to Lion, everything went well! :-)\n\nA: I've had never any problems with upgrades and never lost any files.\nYou should make a backup — or better, make a bootable clone of your current hard drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy an external hard drive\n\n*Install Snow Leopard on the external drive.\n\n*Reboot into the clean external Snow Leopard drive, migrate over users and apps and run all updates. Run from that external to be sure it's a workable copy of your internal drive.\n\n*Disconnect the external drive and put it on the shelf.\n\n*Reboot back into your regular internal hard drive and proceed with the upgrade to Lion.\n\n*Download Lion and run the installer!\n\n\nUntil you're certain that Lion works perfectly, keep the clone around - several months is usually enough time. If you ever need any files from it, just attach the drive and drag-and-drop them. If something goes really horribly wrong, you can boot into the clone, and then clone it back to the internal drive (you'll lose any changes made since you installed Lion). This second drive is really valuable for when you discover three months down the road that one seldom used piece of software won't work on Lion.  You can reboot into Snow Leopard where everything still works and get that one task done. It's a great lifesaver and means you can start using Lion rather than checking that every little thing works perfectly right after the upgrade.\nEDIT:\nThanks Trombone for editing my broken-english post, but please, never add your own ideas into my post. My solution uses pure apple tools, so why bother with SuperDuper, when you can do it with nice clean install and Migration Assistant.\nI never recommend any third-party products when things can be done with default Apple SW. Of course, you can prefer SuperDuper, it is your way - but not mine. Please add another answer explaining how to use SuperDuper or other awesome tools so that people can have a choice. Let's keep this solution needing no additional tools.\n\nA: No guarantees since the upgrade changes your files forever to work with Lion.\nYou don't get an undo step or any snapshot, so if things don't work or there is an error, you will have changed your system. A backup is needed if you care to have a second chance - even if it's something silly like a power outage or something drops on the mac from above.\nMost (the vast majority) have no issues, so your chances are good and you'll likely have no issues.\nBut why risk it? A second hard drive is needed anyhow to back up your important files. Only you can know if you can afford to lose work and files - some really don't need anything on a mac as they can create it all anew.\n\nA: It is as simple as you just explained.  Buy in the app store, wait for it to download, click install, wait for process to complete.\nYou won't lose any of your personal files.\nIf you don't have an external drive, I'd also guess you don't have any backups.  It is recommended to backup before upgrading.  But I've not had any problems or needed them in my 4 upgrades to Lion.  Or any other OS X upgrades. (Snow Leopard, Leopard, Tiger, Panther....)\n\nA: If you really are scared, start with a backup. There is no excuse not to, with external drives getting cheaper every day!\nMy personal setup and standard procedure, which I heartily recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time machine drive, with time machine backup, updated when I remember to plug it in.\n\n*On a separated physical drive, a bootable clone of my HD (updated weekly with SuperDuper)\n\n*Before each 10.x or update (at least): update TM, update bootable clone, unplug the drives, go with update.\n\n\nWhy a time machine backup?\nAs they say: “There are two kinds of users: those that backup their data and those that will”. Don't wait your first disaster. Don't buy it soon, buy it NOW.\nWhy a bootable clone?\nFor a number of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*If my internal HDD failed, my TM backup would be completely useless until I replace it. With a bootable clone, I can continue working roughly were I left while I repair the disaster. Of course YMMV, especially depending on what work you do with your computer.\n\n*In case ALL my laptop fails (e.g. logic board failure, screen exploding), I can still work by attaching to some other computer and booting from there.\n\n*My TM backup may not be so restorable (see this blog post for an example). TM is really a great technology, but has its points of failures and you really really don't want to experience them.\n\n\nWhy SuperDuper?\nBecause it can do delta updates, so that I don't have to move half a terabyte every week.\nAlso, the guy that makes is is super nice. I've never used it, but Carbon Copy Cloner is another software with similar features.\nOn upgrading to Lion\nSnow Leopard improved vastly the upgrade experience (see the Ars review), handling with incredible grace failed installation (I experienced this personally - twice). It is safe to assume that Lion further enhances the process, so (once you have at least a time machine backup), I think you can upgrade with confidence.\nJust one tip: the Lion installer has to check your disk and repartition it. This is not really scary (it may be even healthy to your disk!), but this can mean that the “remaining time” could be VERY off; on my laptop, the advertised 33 minutes were more like two hours; resist the temptation (and the panic) and let it finish! Grab a beverage and a good book :)\n\nA: If you do not have a backup of any sort, you will encounter issues, which may or may not be loss of data.  This is Murphy's Law.\nBefore you spend $30 on the Lion upgrade, get an external USB drive and backup your hard drive using Time Machine, CarbonCopyCloner, or even SuperDuper!  You are asking for trouble by not having a backup.\n", "Q: Can command-line commands be made insensitive to order of filenames and options? I'm new to Mac usage.  It seems that most commands trip over options given after the file names. In linux, which I've used for years, it doesn't matter.  On Apple, it does.

The BSD method works fine on GNU systems, but the GNU method is less portable.\n\nA: The example you have given is normal. I know of no *nix environment that will take flags/options after the file list for ls\nSome commands are just different versions from whichever *nix environment you are coming from.  You can fix things like this by using alias or other shells.\n\nA: If you are using MacPorts (and as a Linux connoisseur you probably are), you can install GNU coreutils with:\nsudo port install coreutils\n\nand then make sure to add the coreutils path to your path:\nexport PATH=/opt/local/libexec/gnubin:$PATH\n\n[Sources: TJ Luoma comment to the accepted answer and this blog post.]\n", "Q: Should I be concerned if the helpd process is eating RAM after an upgrade to Lion? Hallo, I've recently upgraded to Mac OS Lion from Snow Leopard on my 2009 Unibody Macbook. Now, checking in activity monitor I often find a strange process named helpd taking large parts of the memory ~400 MB.\nWhat is it? Is there any solution for it?\n\nA: I hope the fine author of Lingon doesn't disapprove of me using his app to answer this, but here are the reasons why helpd will run. \n(the daemon of help)\n\nIt's hard to tell if this is one of the processes that needs to run a bit the first time it starts and then it will happily update itself more rapidly when needed (like /Applications being changed) as well as early every Sunday AM.\nThe virtual memory system should keep the RAM fine, so unless you see it constantly - it's just taking the RAM it needs to serve your help menu with fresh and up to date documents.\nYou can also disable that launchd job if it's causing you grief until you can isolate why.\n", "Q: Automatically typing a password into terminal I want to be able to change the password of a disk image, but fully automated. Is there a way to enter a string as a password instead of plain text? Or can I have a .txt file with nothing but the password, and somehow import that into the password field? Thanks very much.\n\nA: You did not mention what tool you are using to effect the change of passphrase, but from a shell command line, hdiutil probably makes the most sense.\nIts chpass subcommand will let you change the passphrase of an encrypted disk image. It can be told to read the old and new passphrases from stdin. However, it requires that the passphrases be presented in a “NUL terminated” format, which is difficult to accomplish when typing them directly. You can use the printf command to create the required format though:\nprintf '%s\\0' '01d Pa55w0rD' 'n3w p4ssWoRd' | \n  hdiutil chpass /path/to/encrypted.dmg -oldstdinpass -newstdinpass\n\nThe passphrases should be given in the same order as the -oldstdinpass and -newstdinpass parameters (in the example above, the -oldstdinpass parameter and the old passphrase itself come first in their respective contexts).\n\nNote: If you are in a multi-user environment there is a chance that another user could spot your passphrases by watching the list of processes and their associated command lines (e.g. the printf command and its argument (thus your passphrases) might show up in the output of ps -ef). This is less likely if you are using a shell where printf is a built into the shell itself (e.g. ksh, bash, zsh do not require using a separate process for the external printf command).\n\nA: The expect command can watch and type for you. Whatever you want is possible, storing ssh hashes, scripting the keychain, variables. You can be as tricky or transparent as you are creative. \n", "Q: How can I share all document revisions with another Mac? Mac OS ‘Lion’ introduced a version control system with a fancy user interface called Versions. I’m slowly getting used to working with it and find it quite powerful.\nI have found out how to share the master (head/current) version (revision), and one specific version with another Mac. But how do I share the whole version three including all revisions with another Mac?\nUsing, for example, TextEdit.\n\nA: One person sharing two or more Macs, all running Lion\nMethod A: physical share of a disk\nFor your file to be versioned, save first to removable media with a file system that supports permanent version storage. Save all versions of the file to that volume. \nEject/unmount the volume. Use the volume with other Macs running Lion. \nExamples: \n\n\n*\n\n*a USB flash drive using MS-DOS (FAT) lacks support\n\n*a USB flash drive using JHFS+ does support permanent version storage. \n\n\n\nMethod B: electronic file share of a disk image\nIn a directory that is shared using Apple Filing Protocol (or any other appropriate distributed file system), create a disk image, maybe a sparse bundle. Choose a format — a file system — that supports permanent version storage. \n\nOpen the image. \nFor your file to be versioned, save first to the volume that is imaged. Save all versions of the file to that volume. \nEject/unmount the volume. \nAt another Mac running Lion: \n\n\n*\n\n*connect to the file server\n\n*open the image. \n\n\nHints\nThe Secrets preference pane can help you to enable advanced image options in Disk Utility. \nAn image of a volume may be not reliably backed up whilst the volume is attached/mounted. For reliability, unmount/eject the volume before backing up. \nMultiple users\nEither method A or B will work, but both require negotiation between humans :-)\nMethod C\nFor each version that you wish to share, use the Duplicate command then save a separate file. \nThe downside of this traditional approach is separation. Users of other Macs (not necessarily running Lion) might take a Cover Flow view of the files, but that's not as neat as a versions browser view of a single file. \nAFP, Apple versions and security/privacy\nYou might wonder why saving to an Apple-oriented file service, for example a service using Apple Filing Protocol, does not save Apple versions on the server. Think: privacy, security. \nExample\nSomeone in Government saves a file that describes the true state of the economy, a state that is terrible. The person changes the file to present a different truth, a truth that will keep the lions at bay, saves his or her changes. \nWhen ready to share, the author puts the one file on an AFP server. \nOther users of the server open the file in any application that supports Apple versions. They see only one version, the most recent. \nWe (other users) might wish to see all versions of a file — including versions that were not intended for sharing — but for Mac OS X 10.7 (Build 11A511) the sanest default is: \n\n\n*\n\n*share nothing other than the most recent version. \n\n\nA: According to Ars Technica's Lion review, revisions are stored at /.DocumentRevisions-V100. You might be able to share this with another machine, though it sounds like it's pretty tied to your particular filesystem — and I doubt there's an easy way to share only a single file's revisions.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have multi cam editing in Final Cut Express? Is is possible to do multi-camera editing in Final Cut Express like this\n or this?\nEDIT: I am using FCE 3.5 HD on Snow Leopard. Is that bad?\n\nA: My general opinion it's never bad to keep your money in your pocket and keep using software that works.\nThe last version of final cut express is the same as the last final cut pro (before X was released on the app store) so it is as capable as pro for multiple camera editing.\nThe oldest Express version I have handy is 4.0.1 and it doesn't need any plug-ins to work for multi cam.\n", "Q: Why would Mail's message counts not match Gmail's?

Part of the reason I got rid of it was because it would pop up random messages with things like, \"Your baby is hungary!\" The app appears to be completely deleted, and I can't find any reference to it on the iPod anywhere, but I'll still get random notifications with things like, \"Your baby is sick.\" Is there a way, short of reformatting the iPod, to stop these messages?\n\nA: Removing an app should disable all of the Push Notifications. Try rebooting your iPod, and making sure that iTunes did not re-install it.\nAlso, you can try disabling all Notifications, then -re-enabling them. \nMaybe post a screenshot of the message. You may have another app installed (mBox for example) that displays messages from apps that send emails as well. (of course this is just a far fetched scenario).\n\nA: Try going into the \"notifications\" settings in your iPod's settings to see if u can the app listed there. If so then just turn off it's notification privileges.\n", "Q: How to determine what type of SSD drive is supported for a Macbook? I am leaning towards getting a SSD for my MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2.53GHz, Mid 2009), since this is my first journey into SSD I was wondering if there was anything I needed to consider as far as drive specs when it comes to the mac. I am currently running Snow Leopard but will be upgrading to Lion shortly. As I understand Lion added Trim support, but I could not find a list of drives it supports Trim with. \n\n\n*\n\n*So does Lion support Trim on all SSD?\n\n*Are there any other things I need to check to make sure the SSD I\npurchase is compatible?\n\n\nA: Jfw is right, until now apple only supports their official SSD. While there are some ways to open SSD trim support on 3rd party SSD, when I used these solutions I encountered some weird problems. \nBesides the trim support problem, some capability problems can be solved by updating SSD's firmware.\nI currently use an Intel 320 300g SSD and installed lion without trim support, it has been working wonderfully.\nBefore I bought the Intel SSD, I had considered OWC's products and I think their products are good on capability, however since I am live outside of the United States I didn't choose it.\n\nA: I think your best bet would be using a Samsung 830 (I believe Anandtech recommends it too).

I've been using Apple's screen sharing tool to connect from a client to an Xserve for a while and it's just occurred to me that doing so might be quite a bad idea!\nI know VNC is inherently insecure and that it is possible to tunnel it over SSH, but does Apple's Screen Sharing tool use any secure transport protocol? If not then surely I've been typing in server passwords on my client and they have been transported over the network in plain text.\nAnyway, I now use the Server Management tools and SSH when possible, but I'm sure there will be times when I still need to use VNC.\n\nA: From here:\n\nMac to Mac screen sharing, using the username/password, is done in a secure manner.\nUsing a VNC client and the \"VNC viewers may control screen with password\" is not secure.\n\n\nA: john, are you looking for a solution for business or personal use?\nfor personal use, most of the free hosted solutions are acceptable. most of them use SSL. \nif it is for business, i won't agree on putting all of my company's data in the third-party cloud server.

These startup items can be as unimportant as an autoupdater or compatibility check, but it's entirely possible that the parent app needs the Item, Daemon, or Agent to run.\nSo, here's my advice: If you see something from an app(s) (or drivers, etc.) you do have installed, check that app's preferences to see if it lets you disable the function that requires the startup item. If it does, go ahead. If it doesn't, it's there for a reason; don't delete it.\nIf you really want to play with removing apps' startup stuff, do so carefully and at your own risk. Move the folder or plist to your desktop, restart, and test the app thoroughly. Even if you find it works without its startup item/agent/daemon, keep a copy so you can restore it if something goes wrong.\n", "Q: Email stuck in outbox but can't access it I have Office 2011 installed on Mac OS 10.6 and I tried to send an email to multiple recipients and got this error: The message could not be sent because it has unresolved recipients.

I'm comparing iPhone 32 GiB (4th generation) with iPod Touch 32 GiB (4th generation). Newest models with the same capacity of memory.\n\nA: Well, some of the costs come from the GSM components that the iPhone has, others come from the production process, which is different.\nThen there is the amount of RAM is 512 MB for iPhone and 256 MB for the iPod Touch. Also, the iPhone has a compass. The rear cameras are different - 5 Megapixel camera for the iPhone and 0,7 Megapixel for the iPod.\n\nA: The main reason that the iPhone is twice as expensive as the iPod Touch is nothing to do with what is inside either device. The price difference is mainly down to how they are sold.\nMost iPhone are sold with an associated mobile contract. For some reason people are willing to pay more for a device if the payments for it are spread over a couple of years built into their phone contract. So a significant chunk of the extra cost of the iPhone comes down to the fact that that is simply the cost that people are willing to pay for it.\nThe iPod Touch in comparison is not \"subsidised\" in the way that most iPhones that are sold are (it is a very odd definition of subsidised that the mobile carriers have).\nThat isn't to say that the extra components, software and regulatory issues around the iPhone don't add some cost.\n", "Q: In Keynote, what are chapters and how do I create them? I would like to know what chapters in keynote are and how you generate them. \nNOTE: I first encountered these options when I made a keynote recording and it asked me stuff about making chapters.\nAn other application where I encountered the chapter option was in podcast producer where it askes me if I want to integrate chapters.\nI am trying to make a podcast. Inserting chapters like the ones found in some youtube videos would be great for making it easier for the audience to skip stuff they already know.\n\nA: Chapters in an audio recording are exactly like chapters on a DVD. Many podcasts use chapters in the audio file to allow the listener to listen to specific topics or sections of the show. If you made a keynote podcast about programming an iOS app, you could chapter each project, or a unique aspect of using Xcode, or more.\n\nA: A chapter in this context would be like chapters on a DVD. When you press the skip ahead button it will jump directly to the next chapter marker. I don't see anything in Keynote that refers to chapters, so I suspect this is part of Podcast Producer.\n", "Q: Using same Snow Leopard CD on two MacBooks Are there any kind of troubles that I could get into if I use the same install CD on two laptops? I've just received a laptop from my workplace, but apparently they lost the install CD, and I want to use my own to \"clean up\" the laptop.\n\nA: In writing this answer, I'm assuming that you're speaking the truth when you say your workplace lost the install CD for the laptop--that is, you have the legal right to install it, but not the physical medium with which to do it. I'm not in any way encouraging you to pirate software.\nThat said, when you install Snow Leopard, it won't ask you for a serial number. If the installation disc came with a computer, it will likely only install on computers that are the same model as the one the disc came with--so, for example, the installation disc that came with an iMac won't work on a MacBook Pro. The retail version of the OS, however, will install on the laptop, run normally, and download and install updates without a problem. It will do all of this even if you've used the same disc to install the OS on another computer, because there is no protection scheme in the OS to prevent this.\nEdit: As Samantha Catania says in another answer, the discs that come with a computer are machine-specific, in the sense that they will only install on a very specific model of computer. If your work laptop is a different model than the model the disc came with, it just won't install at all. It'll stop before it does any damage, though, so (again, repeating what Samantha already said) it wouldn't hurt to try. Most likely, though, you'll need either an installation disc for the exact same model you're trying to install on, or a retail disc.\n\nA: The gray installation disks are model specific (i.e. they only contain drivers for the specific hardware which they came with e.g. an iMac or a MacBook Pro). There is no DRM on the disks, nor other copy protection. You can install on multiple computers but all must be the same model.\nIf you have a black retail disk you can only install OS X on multiple computers, and on any model (although possibly not models which were released after the purchase of the retail disk).\n", "Q: Access Time Capsule's files from iPhone Is it possible to access Yime Capsule's files from iPhone?

Or maybe there's a way to enable WebDAV on it? \n\nA: It is not possible to access server shares from Apple's iOS. iOS does not have a Samba or AFP client, and thus, cannot handle these requests.\nTime Capsule uses modified AirPort Extreme firmware and supports AFP and SMB file-sharing protocols.\nUnfortunately, this is the extent of your capabilities of accessing files on Time Capsule from iOS. Sorry :(\n\nA: Oplayer HD is a great app. I use it just for watching videos of any format and last time I used it I saw it also had automatically connected to my data folder on the time capsule. Meaning I can download movies onto the time capsule and then watch them from my IPad. super convenient. Oplayer doesn't open every file, but more than you would think. \n\nA: It is possible with 3rd party software.\nThere are dozens of apps in the App Store for browsing afp/smb network shares, including Time Capsule internal drive.\nSome apps focus on video, some focus on documents, some trying to do both.\n\nA: Use file browser on iTunes it'll do the job\n", "Q: If I export a Word document (authored as a versioned document using Pages 4.1 on Lion),... will it open on Word on Windows?\nI don't have a Word on Windows and I've only Pages on my Mac.\n\nA: The short answer is simply: yes, it will.\n", "Q: Lion Server:Cannot enable address book server I bought lion server and would like to set up an address book server to keep contacts synchronized.  \nWith the address-book side panel is selected I click the On/Off switch, which should turn it on.

While for (Snow) Leopard it was possible to overcome this problem by deactivating a kernel extension of the graphics card driver, this does not seem to have any effect with Lion. \nHow do i disable visual effects with Lion, such as smooth window-moving, drop-shadows everywhere, window-animations, smooth video playback etc.?\nThanks so much!\nUPDATE\nI just wanted to make clear, that I have already tried some UI tweak applications like Cocktail and iTweax. While they are able to disable some animations, the most \"expensive\" effects are not turned off (at least not as far as I know) like smooth window moving and drop-shadows.\n\nA: The place to go to disable animation is in the Secrets preference pane. You can disable a lot of the animations. Has a few Lion preferences and is updated in realtime from the community.\n\nA: TinkerTool 4.7 (free version)\nhas many customization options.

I have audiobooks copied to my iPhone that I didn't buy on iTunes. How can I get them to show up in the Audiobooks section?\nIt's annoying having them mixed with music, because I usually use shuffle.\n\nA: It's easy to tell iTunes that an audio file is an Audiobook.

Would she be able to print from an apple computer to a dell printer?\n\nA: Yes.\nMacs have built-in drivers that allow you to print to just about any USB printer.\nAnd if the computer doesn't already have drivers (although, just about every consumer printer does), Dell supplies drivers for Mac.\nYou may also need to install the custom drivers if you want more advanced functionality (e.g, some brands require you to install their drivers to enable networked print).\nYou can easily add printers using the the Print & Scan pane of System Preferences: Just click the plus button.\n\n\nA: It depends on the Dell printer model you have bought. I have a Dell Color Laser 1320cn (with wired network) hooked up to my MBP. I ended up using some FujiXerox Docuprint driver to get everything working.\n\nA: Is it a USB printer? If so, it should work without any hassle, just plug it in and add it under the Print & Fax section of System Preferences.\n", "Q: Single desktop image for all desktops I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion. Afterward when I would set a Desktop picture (either through System Preferences or iPhoto) it was applied to all desktops.\nYesterday I control clicked the desktop and set a picture and it was only applied to that desktop. Now, wether I use System Preferences or iPhoto it only affects the current desktop. I then have to move SP or iP to a new desktop and set that one, then the next, etc.\nDoes anybody know how to fool Lion back to having single desktop picture for all desktops?\nEdit:\nI have active windows on each desktop that I would like to stay there, so closing all of my apps and regenerating desktops is not helpful. Similarly, gathering all windows to a single desktop and regenerating desktops is again not helpful.\nThe point is to reduce tedium, so anything that involves more steps is clearly not what I'm after.\nTo be explicit, for some reason previously Lion did it the way I want. Some setting in some file somewhere changed this behavior. This is the setting I'm looking for.\n\nA: The answer is simple (and very Apple-like!).\nSimply close all extra desktops until you only have one desktop. (To do this, go to Mission Control, hold down alt and click the crosses which appear on unwanted desktops).\nThen change the desktop background for the one remaining desktop.\nNow any new desktops you create will inherit the background of that first desktop.\n\nA: The following is just a work around.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences (go to 'Desktop & Screen Saver',\n\n*Via the Dock, access System Preference's 'Options',\n\n*Select 'All Desktops' under 'Assign To'\n\n*Cycle through your desktops - (at least) the window will already be open to adjust the image for that desktop.\n\n\n(Another benefit of this work around is that you can also easily set different backgrounds for different desktops.)\nOtherwise, calling this an inconsistency is too nice: I'd call it a bug.\n\nA: I would recommend an app i use called stay. it's not free but it might be of great use in positioning windows just the way you want them. You could close all extra spaces, set the picture and tell stay to restore ur windows to their saved screen locations\n\nA: one simple way of doing so, is \n\n\n*\n\n*go to the last window and open Desktop preferences and change the background.\n\n*drag the preference window to the left hold it for 1 second so you will shift to the next one again change it and repeat the process until you land in the first.\n\n\nThis way you avoid having to close and open the preference plane.\n", "Q: using windows on a mac for a few applications i need to use visual studio and a few other windows programs but i am now looking at getting an iMac.  Can someone recommend the best solutions for being able to use these windows programs from a mac.\nI see that there is bootcamp built into the mac operating system but i am unclear if that is the best solution from a workflow point of view (switching back and forth)\n\nA: Virtualisation software such as VMware Fusion, Parallels or Virtual Box will allow you to run windows \"in a Window\". They work very well.\nI recommend VMWare, as best performance-wise, and has some advanced features which make the file exchange between OS's almost seam-less. VirtualBox is less user friendly, but still works well and is free.\nNote that for this to work well you need plenty of RAM. I'd recommend 4GB as a minimum.\n", "Q: What are some good uses of Hazel? I think Hazel is a great idea, but I'm having trouble finding practical uses for it. A short search revealed the below pages, but I still didn't find anything compelling.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why I Started Using Hazel for Mac\n\n*Mac Automation Tips: Hazel\n\n*Seven Amazing Uses for Hazel\n\nA: For me, Hazel works best when I'm using it in conjunction with other tools. On its own, in can seem a little lackluster or underwhelming, but when combined with other applications or used as the 'glue' between them it really shines.\n\n\n*\n\n*One of my uses is to automatically organize PDFs of schedules from work. I've got a Dropbox account, and make use of Send to Dropbox to allow me to email attachments straight into my Dropbox. The issue is that they're not always consistently named, and I don't feel like manually renaming them. I have Hazel watch the destination folder, and when a PDF arrives, whether its named 7.30, 7/30, 07-30, etc, it automatically renames it, moves it to folder with other already acted on files, and archives away old versions. The result is that I have a nice archive of schedules, all consistently named/sorted.\n\n*I use Hazel to help out with video encoding/tagging tasks. After encoding a file, Hazel picks up on it in the destination directory, and automatically renames it based on a consistent naming scheme. Once it does this, it applies a label to the file, and moves it to a new folder where files awaiting metadata live. Any file here gets passed through an automator script that adds some basic metadata (show type, year, etc) before passing it into iFlicks for the final touches before throwing it into iTunes.\n\n*It also handles more mundane tasks. Some trackers list .torrent files with a .txt extension. Hazel will monitor the downloads folder, and if a file with a .txt extension shows up, it checks the file's \"Where from\" attribute, and if it matches a trackers website, it changes the extension to .torrent and moves the file into my Torrents directory so that Transmission can add it.\n\n*There are times when I don't need to see my Bootcamp volumes mounted on the desktop. Hazel can check for this volume, and it if sees it mounted, it'll run a shell script to unmount it.\n\nA: Some use cases of my own: \n\n\n*\n\n*Synchronizing my kindle in 1 click: instapaper.com has a setting to send articles daily to your kindle mail adress. But sometimes I want to force an upload of all unread articles just now. I just have to download the mobi file from instapaper then Hazel takes over :\n\n\n*\n\n*Move ebooks rule detects .mobi in my Downloads folder and move them to an Ebooks folder in my Public Dropbox account.\n\n*an ifttt.com rule is triggered and send an email to my kindle adress with the .mobi as attached file\n\n\n*Turning my Mac mini into an automated media center: my mac mini sits under my TV and is not supposed to be controlled by mouse or keyboard. Hazel is the central part of my setup that enables complex actions to be executed without user interactions. I wrote a blog post on this specific subject.  \n", "Q: Problematic performance of Adobe CS5.5 suite on OSX (Snow Leopard) We are running some 17 iMacs ranging from 2008 models to 2010 models, all with 4gb ram. Most are on 10.5, the newest one on 10.6\nWe upgraded from CS 4 to CS 5.5 last month. We also upgraded from suitcase fusion 2 to 3 because of this. Both apps with the latest updates.\nNow I've got some annoyed designers on my hands ;) The performance is abominable. Just moving a shape sends the CPU into overdrive.\nOnly one the two cores goes to 100% CPU. Memory is available, no swapping. Disk almost empty. No extreme disk io.\nWe have implemented all illustrator and indesign performance settings we found on the fora of adobe. This improved the situation somewhat but it's not really workable.\nMaybe related, an illustrator file, using only shapes, no fonts, with terrible performance when moving the shape. We tried saving as PDF, from local disk to local disk, 8mb PDF, 1 minute. Opened from our server (Windows, but with AFP sharing via Extreme-Z IP) the PDF is 37mb and it takes 10 minutes.\nI'm at a loss so I hope there is some kind of magic bullet :)\n\nA: By now we found the problem. Our Filewave deployment system kept overwriting the .pref files. We removed them from the deployment and the issue was fixed. So far for saving time deploying through Filewave :)\n\nA: Wow, that seems extreme. What did Adobe Tech support say? I've never seen this behavior, although I never worked with CS5.5 before, only have CS5 right now. I don't believe the server is the culprit here, as these operations do not rely on the server while they are being done. However, doest hurt to try with a file on the desktop.\nAlso, did you try to remove Suitcase extensions (or any third-party plug-in) to see if there could be a bug there? As I understand it only a few apps where actually updated in CS5.5 and InDesign is one of them, so there might be something that changed and requires and update.\nBesides that, I would do a complete reinstall from scratch of one of your machine just to see if the problem persists. Maybe on an external drive just not to render one machine useless.\nLet me know if this helps...\n", "Q: Connect to Linux File System with default \"Connect to Server\"? I'm wondering what kind of setup I need on my Linux machine to be able to connect to it using the default \"Connect to Server\" (command + k) in OSX.

I just got the 2011 Mac Mini with 10.7.  But I am planning to use the hard drive from the 2009 Mac Mini with 10.6 OS X as an external USB drive for my new 2011 Mac Mini.  \nQuestion:  Can I boot from the external USB with 10.6 from my new 2011 Mac Mini?  (Using the Option key when turn on the computer, etc.)  So, that I can boot into either 10.6 (on the external USB drive) or 10.7 (the internal drive) from my mini 2011?\n\nA: Intel Macs can boot to a USB volume, but in this case it will not work. The reason is because the new Mid 2011 macs ship with 10.7, as you mentioned. Macs ship with a minimum supported OS, and will not boot or allow installation of any OS prior to that. Therefore, a Mac that shipped with 10.7 will not boot to a 10.6 install. You'll probably be able to see in when holding option at startup, but if you select it it will likely show an Apple logo and hang there.\n", "Q: Open Finder window from current Terminal location? If I am in a specific path in a Terminal window, how can I open that same window in a new Finder window? \nNote: This is the opposite of opening a Terminal from Finder.\n\nA: open .\n\nAs a nice addition, add an alias in .bash_profile or .bash_aliases if you have one.\nalias finder='open'\n\nThen you can use finder . which I think is more intuitive.\n\nA: If you have autojump installed, you don't even have to type the full path to the directory. You can simply type jo partialdirectoryname, and autojump will open a new Finder window in the specified directory.\nI love this method, because you don't have to remember the entire directory name.

Is it possible to do with disk utility?\n(Similar to this, but I have an external hard drive)\n\nA: This is done the same way with external or internal drives.\nStart your Disk Utility (Applications -> Utilities -> Disk Utility). In the left pane, select the disk for which you wish to change the partition table (select the disk, not one of its partitions, disks are at the \"top levels\" in the tree view in the left pane).\nIn the right pane, select the \"Partition\" tab. You must repartition your drive in order to change to GUID, so in the \"Partition Layout\" dropbox select \"1 partition\" (or however many you want).\nClick on the \"Options...\" button right below the list view showing your partitions and select \"GUID partition table\".

What does \"everybody\" exactly mean in File Sharing in the Sharing Preference Pane in Mac Os X.\nSounds as if everybody in the local network could read my files without authentication if its set to read-only. Is that right?\n\nA: Any user on your machine would be able to read the files. People on the local network can only read from the places you have set up in Sharing preferences (under file sharing).\n", "Q: Why do some OSX progams have an installer (mpkg) instead of drag-drop? Most OSX programs can be installed by dragging the app to the Applications folder (or wherever the user wants them).\nHowever, some software must be installed by launching an .mpkg package, acting more like the 'double-click and press next-next-next...' installation method under Windows. For example: Google sketchup has an installer, while Google Picasa is drag-and-drop. \nWhy is this? \nWould it technically be impossible for those programs that use the installer approach to provide the 'standard' drag-and-drop approach? I would assume that any files that need to be installed in specific locations could be done so upon first launch of a drag-and-dropped program?\n\nA: The drag-and-drop method originaly came from cases where the application was a stand-alone executable, so all you needed to do to install it was drag the executable from a floppy to the App folder.\nToday many applications use installers that let you drag-and-drop to the app folder, while the drag action in fact launches an installer that will install multiple files in different places. So technically the drag-and-drop today may very well be an installer.\nSo why then use an \"Next-next-next-install\" installer? Because you may want to ask the user questions! Maybe you don't want to install all parts of the software? Maybe you want it installed somewhere else? Or it could simply be a question of accepting the license agreement.\nYou can't do that with the drag-and-drop install.\n\nA: Packages are not always necessary even when they are used. So it comes down to:\n\n\n*\n\n*The developers decided the installer method was the best and decided to use it, even if it was not necessary.\n\n*It is necessary because the installer is also installing more than just an application,  elsewhere or is installing more than one application. The method of adding them at first launch would also work, but Apple provides this packaging tech, and it would require writing extra code in order to accomplish it, and this method also leaves behind an installer receipt so you can go back and see what files were added by a package.\n\nA: Personaly, I dislike drag-and-drop installs, unless there is clear visual instructions that you need to drag it into your applications folder (even better if there is a symlink to the said folder), because I stopped counting the number of users who thought they installed an app when they dragged it from the mounted disk image onto the dock. Everytime the app was launched the image had to be mounted again.\nAlso, there is some magic happening when you drag an app into the Applications folder, like the icons for the files it manages are added to your OS, or the list of files it can open, etc. \nHaving an installer makes sure the app is correctly installed and you can even add it to the dock automatically at the end of the process.\n", "Q: App For Fixing Broken Links in iTunes Using the technique described in this post:\nhttp://paulmayne.org/blog/2007/11/how-to-remove-broken-or-dead-tracks-from-itunes/\nI was able to get a list of all of my broken links in iTunes.  The vast majority of these files have just been moved to other directories on my hard drive.\nAre there any apps available which will just check my hard drive for the missing files, and then update the links if and when they are found?\n\nA: There is Super Remove Dead Tracks, but that's probably not exactly what you want. Then there is iTunes Track CPR which seems to be closer but still not what you need. Maybe contacting one of the authors (or extending the AppleScript code yourself) might help.\n", "Q: Is upgrading an iMac to an SSD over USB 2/FireWire an upgrade? I bought the smallest 21\" iMac model of the 2011 update cycle. I was planning on having the HDD replaced with an SSD later on. Turned out this would not be an option.\nSo I'm either stuck with the 7200 RPM internal disk or switching to a much more expensive iMac model with an SSD. As this would be the only part of this better-configured iMac, the 256 GB SSD would cost me a whooping 800€ (~$1150 or the price of a new small line iMac). I just don't want to spend this kind of money.\nThe iMac comes equipped with a Thunderbolt, a FireWire 800 and a couple of USB 2.0 ports. \n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt should be the fastest, but there's no hardware for it yet (right?)\n\n*FireWire 800 should be the second fastest with 800Mbit or ~100MB/s which is faster than what the internal drive produces\n\n*USB 2 still has 480Mbit or 60MB/s which still should outperform the internal drive\n\n\nSo my question is: would I get a good speed bump by buying an SSD and one of those storage enclosures (this one looks really nice)? Would that benefit the overall system performance or is there no bump to expect?\nI'd love to put a 128GB SDD in that thing and put the system and applications on that while keeping the data on my internal drive.\n\nA: There would be a major speed bump. Not as fast as having the drive on an internal SATA interface but noticably fast all the same.\nI ran a four and a half year old iMac 24 inch on a Crucial M4 SSD via a Firewire 800 enclosure for about 5 months to get a major boost over the internal SATA HD.\nYou'll notice an immediate improvement to random read/write speeds, day-to-day things like app launch and system boot times. Sustained rates will only be as fast as the interface you pick and may not be any better than your internal drive. However since most OS and app disk activity is random this isn't too important.\nWith Thunderbolt available on your system a future SATA 6Gbps enclosure to Thunderbolt interface will remove the sustained transfer rate  limitation.\nAvoid USB 2 as you will never reach the theoretical 60 MB/s due to USB protocol overheads. I have only ever seen a maximum of 35-40 MB/s over USB 2 hence my choice of a Firewire 800 enclosure.\n\nA: SSD's over USB are much faster, than hard drives but don't live up to their full potential. There's also latency to consider: it's is much higher over USB than native SATA, since it doesn't have to go through a controller.\nThat said, an iMac is so much trouble to crack open, it's often not worth it, and a (future) Thunderbolt enclosure solves this problem nicely.\n", "Q: Copying Devanagari on OS X I am working with several files in various formats (PDF, HTML, DOCX) that contain Devanagari (Indian) script.\nWhen I try to copy text using either CMD+C or the right-click menu, it is transformed into latin letters immediately:\n\nBoth the copy source (Safari in this case) and target (TextEdit) support Devanagari script.\nWhy does this happen and how can I fix it?\n\nA: This looks as if the pdf file did not use unicode but embedded a special font with ASCII bindings for Devanagari characters.\nThere probably won’t be an automatic way to transform this into unicode characters.\nAs an alternative, you could try to find the original font and use that. (Maybe start with this font.) Of course this will not solve the problem for any other users of the document.\n", "Q: How do I set up an IRC server on OS X for my local network? Is there a nice way to set up an IRC server for my wireless home network, running on an old Mac Mini?\nOn other forums people have recommended compiling IRCD-Hybrid for OS X. I have Homebrew installed and it contains a formula for ngIRCd; would that work?\nOr should I give up and just use the Bonjour functionality built into iChat?\n\nA: Since you have Homebrew installed, ngircd is very simple to install and configure.\nInstall ngIRCd\n$ brew install ngircd\n\nAdd /usr/local/sbin to your PATH\n$ vi ~/.bash_profile\n\nedit the config file (very easy to follow, even for a beginner, as the defaults are just fine for everything.) Note the path may be different for you to homebrew / ngircd version folders.\n$ cd /usr/local/mxcl-homebrew-697d2ae/Cellar/ngircd/17.1/etc/\n$ vi ngircd.conf\n\nHere's a sample config file, should you need it.\nVerify your config, if you like:\n$ ngircd --configtest\n\nThen simply start the server:\n$ ngircd\n\n\nA: There are a couple packages available via MacPorts. If you haven't used MacPorts it's just like yum or apt-get on Linux.\n", "Q: iPad Pages: replacing the wood effect theme Is there any way to replace the brown wood-effect toolbars used by Pages on the iPad with something more neutral?\n\nA: If your device is jailbroken, I assume you can modify files within an app's bundle? I haven't jailbroken my device, so I'm not sure exactly how this works. However, if you have:\nWithin the Pages bundle, there are images called TP_RulerBackground.png and TP_toolbar_top_bg_norm.png. If you replace these files with something else, it'll change the toolbars/rulers.\n\n\n", "Q: Understanding what is being downloaded Using iStat (which provides a small graph in the menubar showing the present upload and download speeds), I notice once in a while that something is being downloaded, without any action on my part. Since I allow most of the programs to download all the updates, any of them, plus MacOSX updates, plus Dropbox etc. may be the culprit at any given time. But is there a quick way to understand what exactly is being downloaded at a given moment (for instance, to stop it if the case might be)?\n\nA: There are different ways of doing this. The easiest way is to use an application designed for this purpose like Little Snitch which has the option of showing a window that displays what files are being downloaded/uploaded and to where.\n\n", "Q: How can I login iChat with my Apple ID? I have 2 apple ID. All of them are not mac.com or me.com account. I didn't know about them hone making the accounts. However, now I can't login with my apple ID on iChat. I have been used Google Talk account, but it has too many features not supported. I want full featured iChat experience (support all iChat features including file transfer, group chat, video chat...). What should I do?\n\nA: If both people are using iChat, all the features will work over Jabber, but you are out of luck if both people are not using iChat.\nThe MobileMe/.Mac sign in, when I used it anyway, used AOL’s OSCAR protocol used for AIM and ICQ (you should still be able to sign in with an ICQ account by treating it as an AIM account) due to an old and separate deal between Apple and AOL, so MobileMe users can talk to AIM and ICQ users without a gateway and vice versa. Still, even talking to them, the feature ratio between AIM clients and iChat is not 1:1, so some things would probably still break, iChat Theater if nothing else anyway, unless the other party was also using iChat.\nSo for a full featured iChat experience, send free Macs to all of your friends. Instant Messaging clients have shaky interoperability at best beyond basic text messages, which is unfortunate. As an alternative, I can recommend Skype which works on multiple platforms, and I find it also has better audio quality than iChat (both are quite crashy for me with audio chats and screen sharing though). There is also FaceTime which IIRC does use your Apple ID, but will only work for people using Macs, iPhones and iPads.\n\nA: You cannot use a apple id for logging into iChat. You nee to have one of MobileMe, AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), Google Talk, or [any] Jabber account. And as toy have already found out, you cannot use all features of iChat with jabber accounts. I think this is more because of the Jabber/XMPP protocol than iChat.\nFrom http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2515:\n\nTo use iChat, all you need is access to the Internet and one of the\n  following accounts: MobileMe, AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), Google\n  Talk, or Jabber. Here's how to set up and use iChat\n\n", "Q: Accessing events on external drive in iMovie '11 on Lion I have my iMovie events stored on my external harddrive (located in a Synology NAS). It worked like a charm with iMovie '11 on Snow Leopard.\nI then received my new MBP with Lion and the external drive is not showing. I cannot thus access my events which is pretty annoying as it prevents me from using the application...\n\nHere is what I see in iMovie:(see edit 2 for new state)\n\nI previously had my external drive below the Macintosh HD one.\n\nMy external drive is correctly mounted before launching iMovie:\n\nIt has the iMovie Events folder at root level (and as I said, it was correctly detected under same iMovie version on Snow Leopard).\nI tried mounting it using afp: but result is the same.\nAny help appreciated as I don't get what could have changed between SL and Lion for this.\n\nedit: Same with volume now mounted using NFS:\n\nThe list in iMovie stays desperately empty...\n\nedit 2: something new!\nMy NFS mounts are now visible in the list (probably coming from an update of iMovie inbetween).\nProblem is that they are still empty and with a yellow warning sign, without any tooltip on it...\n\n\nA: Lion turned off an older and less secure method of authenticating AFP connections, which a lot of third-party vendors of NAS devices were using, including Synology. Synology have made available a beta release of their new firmware which fully supports Lion (as long as your Synology device was made in 2008 or later).\n\nA: OK, I did me a nice christmas gift by solving this, and quite easily in fact.\nIt could be considered as workaround only but it saved my life.  \nAnswer: symlink!\nNow, in my Movies folder, the iMovie Events folder is pointing to the iMovie Events folder I have on my external harddrive. All my videos are back and I can add videos without issue.  \nSo waiting for the trick to get it work how it should, at least, I can use the application again!\n", "Q: Creating folders in the Applications folder I like to keep things neat in my computer, so when I started to have too many apps, I decided to create subfolders within my /Applications folder and move tings around.\nSometimes, I got asked to enter my password.\nSometimes, softwares upgrades won't work. Or sometimes they create duplicates. Sometimes things seem to get messed up.\nI guess my question is, is it considered good to create folders there? What's the best way to handle this?\n\nA: It's not really considered \"bad\" to put folders there, but (as you've seen) it can cause problems with some apps.\nThe reason the updates are failing: The installer/updater looks for an app in the /Applications folder and doesn't find it. So, it assumes the app is not yet installed and that you are trying to install the whole app from the update, so it fails.\nAlternatively, the app could be duplicated because the updater doesn't find the app and decides to install a new copy.\nTo avoid this problem, here's what I recommend:\nCreate another \"organized apps\" folder somewhere.\nMake folders in it as you have in your /Applications folder.\nOpen one Finder window to /Applications and one to your new one.\nSelect ten apps from your Applications folder. Right-click and choose Make Alias. Give it a second. Then, drag the aliases you've made into the new folder. Repeat this (ten apps at a time) with the rest of your /Applications folder.\nNow, you've got 'links' to all your apps in your new folder. Organize them how you want. You can now double-click the aliases in that folder to launch the apps they correspond to. Feel free to re-name and reorganize these aliases as you want.\nNote that, with this method, updates should work. You will, however, have to manually add each app you install to the other folder.\n\nA: I personally like putting things in ~/Applications so just create an Applications folder in your home folder and move your non-apple applications there.  Even if you install an app using the Mac App Store you can move it there after it installs and it will continue to update.\n", "Q: When Organized by Conversation, Mail's Inbox sometimes sends out to wrong recipient When Lion's Mail Inbox is set to \"Organize by Conversation\", an odd behavior often occurs. If I hit Reply to the latest email from my correspondent, the recipient in the new email is me, not this correspondent. \nI'm aware that any of the emails in the Conversation can be individually highlighted (seen as a blue line around that email), and that if this blue line is around one of the correspondent's emails, hitting Reply definitely sets the new email to be sent to this correspondent. However, if nothing is blue-highlighted, and I hit Reply, the new email is set to be sent to... me. Which of course isn't the objective.\nWhew, that was harder to explain than the issue, but I hope my question is clear!\n\nA: There are at least half a dozen threads on Apple Support about this, and was a bug that has been fixed as of 10.7.2. \n\nA: when the individual message is highlighted (as you said the blue box around that message), move the mouse to the separator line between the header and the message body, there is a float toolbar appear, hit the reply button there.\n\nMeanwhile, Mail.app will organize all related message in the Conversation mode (as set in the preference), so the message you sent out (in the Sent box) will appear in the conversation.  So, if the message you sent is the 1st message in the conversation, when you hit reply without any message highlighted, Mail.app will set sent to.... you.\n\n", "Q: How do I change the clip length with the iMovie 2011 trailer presets? I'm trying to prepare a trailer with nice presets incoming in iMovie 2011...\nCan I change the storyboard or alter clip length? If so, how?\n\nA: Yes, you can do this.  I'd recommend using the storyboard shot list to get as much of the trailer done as you want following the recommended settings/lengths.\nThen, when you are ready to take more control, use the File->Convert to Project menu option.  This will transition the Project settings to the normal iMovie project version and you can change clip durations using the \"Clip Adjustments\" popup.  You can also drag more event footage into the project/change or add transitions, etc. just as you would a normal project.\n", "Q: Finding Rosetta / PPC applications on disk I know how to determine if a program is an Intel or PPC application (with Cmd-I or in the Activity Monitor).\nBut how can I find all PPC applications that still lurk on my disk?\nBefore upgrading to Lion I'd rather know which (seldom used) applications on my disk won't work anymore (I'd be happy with GUI or terminal ways to do this). \n\nA: Bring up System Profiler (System Information in OS X Lion) -OR- go to Apple, About This Mac and click on the More Info... button.  If in Lion, click on the File, Show System Report menu.  In the left sidebar choose Applications under the Software section and sort by the Kind column. Now just find the applications that are PowerPC.\n\nA: this shell script\nfind / -type f -perm -u=x -exec lipo -info {} \\; 2>/dev/null | grep ppc | egrep -v 'i386|x86'\n\nwill print all binary executables (not only applications, but command line executables too) what are ppc but not intel.\nWarning: will run really long time (maybe several ten minutes).\nThe script is really not effective, because will start zilion times the command \"lipo\" for all regular file. (what are clearly not executables too - like images). If someone want optimize it - feel free ;)\n", "Q: How do I show the Dock in full-screen mode? This one took me awhile to discover, but you can show the Dock while in Lion's new full-screen mode: \nPlace your cursor to the side where you currently store your Dock (right, left, or bottom), so that it's sitting on the last pixel of that edge. Then lift your finger and push towards the edge again, holding it in the push. Voilà, the Dock appears. \nSmall thing, but I found this particular interface just brilliant. It prevents the Dock showing up accidentally, which could be a common problem in full-screen mode, given that, well, we're using the entire screen all the way up to that edge that normally triggers the Dock. \n\nA: The answer you posted in the question (unorthodox, yes) is correct: you have to move the mouse toward the edge of the screen in a separate motion.\nBut also, note that you don't have to lift your finger. You can just move the mouse to the edge of the screen, pause, and give it a little extra nudge.\n\nA: In order to get the Dock to appear for full-screen app, rest (don't click) your finger on the mouse anywhere on the screen, while swiping to the bottom of the screen. The Dock will then appear immediately when you hit bottom. \n\nNote that none of the other methods described here work reliably for me, but this one does every time.\n", "Q: How to remove a folder link from side bar in OS X Lion I've updated my OS to Lion today. But now, I can't remove the folder \"maven-2.2.0\" from Finder Sidebar. This folder was deleted from my computer, and I can't right click on it.\nHow to do it?\n\n\nA: Hold down ⌘ Command while dragging the item out.\nI found this Lion change interesting; I don't necessarily like it, but I think it mirrors the way that you have to hold down ⌘ when rearranging toolbar items.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro beeps and powers on after 5 tries I have a MacBook Pro from mid 2009 annoying me.\nWhen I turn it on, the led blinks rapidly, about 14 times, and then the Mac beeps once. The screen remains black and nothing happens. So I have to hold down the power button to force a shutdown. When I turn it on again, no beep or blinks, but still a black screen. I repeat that 3 more times and the Mac finally turns on and works normally. I use it, shut it down and when I want to use it again, I have to go through that process all over again: the beep, blinks and 4 tries until it comes back to life.\nI've opened it and tried changing the memories, the hard drive, but no different results.\nIt's worth mentioning that I was reinstalling it for triple boot when that happened, however I've repartitioned the HD and it's back to the original state now, so I believe it does't have to do with that reinstall.\nI'm not able to run the hardware test pressing D before startup, even with the original disc.\nI googled for it but couldn't find any alike pattern.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Found the answer. The problem was due to the installation of rEFIt for the triple boot.\nI found the detailed video solution here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoU8838KDo \n\nA: Have you recently changed your RAM configuration? If so, or even if not, try reseating your RAM. From this article:\n\nIf you turn on a MacBook when it’s completely powered off (not sleeping), and instead of starting up, the screen remains dark and the sleep light is blinking, the MacBook’s RAM might not be installed properly or might have worked loose.\n\nI think you also see the rapidly-blinking light when doing a firmware update, but I think a RAM issue is more likely than a firmware-related issue. You can also check out this page for beep pattern definitions.\n", "Q: What is the quickest way to setup Instiki on Lion? A few months ago I setup an Instiki wiki using Snow Leopard.\nIt took me quite a while, as I had to work some black magic to understand which version of ruby (plus gems/rails) I was supposed to install/update.\nNow I've upgraded to Lion after formatting (bad idea huh?), and I'd like a new instiki up and running. So I thought: instead of wasting another day in trial and error I might ask if someone smarter and more knowledgeable has a quick and dirty way to do it (e.g. avoiding installing xcode tools!).\nCheers!\np.s. Instiki is very cool http://www.instiki.org/show/HomePage, especially if you like maths. Its user-friendliness is very far from Tiddlywiki, but I think it's much cooler.\np.p.s. please feel free to retag appropriately.\nEDIT As pointed out, some more info might be useful.\nWhen I try to run instiki (contained in a folder named taccuino) this is what it tells me\n./Desktop/taccuino/config/../config/preinitializer.rb:20: Bundler couldn't find some gems.Did you run `bundle install`?

I first noticed that double finger tapping the trackpad didn't show any menu when in chrome (either on a link or on anything).\nI thought it was a problem with my trackpad settings in OS X Lion but I checked the Finder and Firefox and right-clicking DOES work. Was it broken together with other mouse gestures in OS X Lion? \nIs there a current fix for this?\n\nA: Looks like it was one of my plugins: Mouse gestures. I was wondering why it was working on my speed dials page(the right click) and when I turned off gestures, right click suddenly worked. \n", "Q: How / is it possible to compare files on your hard drive with those in your time machine backup? I have snow leopard and have been using time machine to regularly backup files.\nHow / is it possible to compare files on your hard drive with those in your time machine backup?\nI know you can restore folders. But I'd like to see if I'm missing any files and if files have changed ?\n\nA: I realize you tagged this as a Snow Leopard question, but if you upgrade to Lion, the new tmutil command-line utility will let you compare backups:\nUsage: tmutil compare [-a@esmugtdrvX] [-D depth]\n       tmutil compare [-a@esmugtdrvX] [-D depth] snapshot_path\n       tmutil compare [-a@esmugtdrvX] [-D depth] path1 path2\n\nPerform a diff of or against backups.\n\nIn the first form, tmutil will compare the computer to the latest snapshot.\n\nIn the second form, tmutil will compare the computer to the specified snapshot.\n\nIn the third form, you can compare arbitrary things to each other, including things on the computer to things inside your backups.\n\nThe compare verb allows you to specify what properties to compare. The default property set is equivalent to the -smugt option set. Specifying any property option overrides the default set.\n\n# this means \"compare using the basic -smugt metadata set\"\n$ tmutil compare\n\n# this means \"compare all metadata supported by tmutil and data forks\"\n$ tmutil compare -ad\n\n# this means \"compare extended attributes, ACLs, file modes, and data forks\"\n$ tmutil compare -@emd\n\nOptions:\n    -a   compare all supported metadata\n    -@   compare extended attributes\n    -e   compare ACLs\n    -s   compare sizes\n    -m   compare file modes\n    -u   compare UIDs\n    -g   compare GIDs\n    -t   compare mod times\n    -d   compare file data forks\n    -r   ignore specified root paths and just compare descendents\n    -D <depth>   limit traversal depth to <depth> levels from the beginning of iteration\n    -E   don't take exclusions into account when comparing items inside volumes\n    -v   enable verbose mode (enables reporting of all identical items, which is noisy)\n    -X   print output in XML property list format\n\n\nA: I have just tried to use: tmutil compare and the output is quite devastating because  of the huge amount of data (and the lack of documentation that explain how to read it). In my opinion, tmutil help is a little bit too concise. \nI want highlight the utmost importance of the first character in the line:\n\n\n*\n\n*! means file has changed (size, time, acl...)\n\n*- means file is missing\n\n*+ means file new\n\n\nSo the output:\n+ 0B                            /Users/me/Configuring\n! 37.4K   (size, mtime)         /Users/me/.viminfo\n!

The program is called Backup Loupe 2 and even with the new tools on Lion, I still find myself using it. For you, it will work fine on Snow Leopard and provide tools that the system doesn't.\nhttp://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/\n\nA: You could use\ndiff -r <folder on your regular drive> /Volumes/<your TM drive>/Backups.backupdb/<your machine name>/Latest/<same folder path as in the first argument>\n\nto see the differences. If you don't want to see the actual differences for text files, add a -q switch to the diff command to suppress that kind of output.\n", "Q: Login hangs on spotlight and no network is available After upgrading to Lion, I boot up and most of my icons don't appear on the right side of the top menu bar and when I hover over spotlight, I get the spinning pinwheel and there's no network access.  The preferences open up fine but when I click on network, it hangs.\nThe only way I can get around it is to reboot while holding down the shift key.\nI read about a fix (that didn't work for me) that clears the font caches by executing:\natsutil databases -removeUser\natsutil server -shutdown\natsutil server -ping\n\nAnd another fix suggestion that said to use FontNuke & check the \"Reset Spotlight\" and \"Repair Permissions\" boxes before clicking \"Nuke Font Caches\".  However, FontNuke isn't available yet for Lion.\nHas anyone else had this problem and found a way to fix it?\nUpdate: The new version of FontNuke is out yet it didn't fix my problem.  Still SOL.  \nAnyone see this and have any ideas?\n\nA: You can turn off Spotlight indexing for the whole hard drive in System Preferences -> Spotlight.\nThen after rebooting turn it on again, and Spotlight will re-index.\nMy problem is that I'm having this problem every other or every third reboot.\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem; I found a workaround (far from calling this a solution...): downloaded the last version of fintnuke, bot the system in safe moe holding shift during startup, run FontNuke using Admin Free Nuke with the reset spotlight index checked. After rebooting everything works, but if you restart the problem is still there...so this is not a real solution\n\nA: I had the same Problem. In my case it was because of a hard disk error. When I ran a volume check on the system volume in the disk utility (Utilities->Disk Utility) I got an error message. So I took my snow leopard CD and booted from the CD. In the installation surface I started the Disk Utility again and repaired my system volume. Afterwards I was able to start Lion again without any problems.\n", "Q: Phantom iCal calendar subscriptions won't go away after deleting and iCal missing from Mobile.me I had subscribed to my meetup.com calendar via iCal and after a week decided to delete the calendar subscription by right clicking on the subscribed calendar name and clicking delete.  However, I still get popups to add events to my calendar for meetup even after I deleted it.\nI thought I'd resysnc my data from Mobile.me and overwrite my calendar data on my mac with the data from Mobile.me and the calendar data doesn't even appear in the Mobile.me preferences, though everything else seems to still be there.\nHas anyone else had this problem and know how to:\nget the phantom calendars to go away forever\nget iCal to re-appear in Mobile.me sync preferences\n-- Brian\n\nA: This got answered for me on https://discussions.apple.com/message/15816044#15816044\nTurns out that it wasn't enough to delete the calendar in iCal, I also had to change a setting at meetup.com.\n", "Q: Saving information in Dictionary.app Is there a way I can save the history for what I have searched for in Dictionary.app or save them for reference within the application itself ? \n\nA: I would love it if you could view your history or bookmark words, but I'm fairly sure that you can't. See, for example, the TUAW article \"Apple updates Dictionary app in Lion, still has a long way to go\":\n\nI would also love to be able to bookmark favorite words and create word lists where I can group similar words together for quick access.\n\nI'm also unaware of any hacks or add-ons that would make this possible.\n\nA: Unfortunately the Dictionary app is not scriptable. But you can use this applescript, and create it as an app and every time you click on it it after opening the dictionary with the word it will log in a text file the entry word you look up. I had this created as I wanted to keep a running record of all the words that I look up. \n\n", "Q: Apple TV won't start Netflix Streams When playing some TV shows on Netflix on a new Apple TV, sometimes the show does not start playing. I get the spinning pinwheel for a \"normal\" period of time, then a black screen. If I press select, I can see the playback progress bar shows the proper length for the show I selected, but the only command it responds to is Menu.\nIf I switch over to the Roku that this the Apple TV is replacing, it can stream the same episode just fine. Ditto if I try streaming it over the Xbox or Blueray player.\nThings I've tried\nI've changed from Google's DNS, back to my ISP's (Time Warner), to OpenDNS and back to TWC's with no improvement.

It still had problems, so I started digging deeper.\nThrough some more specific testing, I narrowed down that it was only happening with movies that had Dolby Digital. In the settings, I had forced the Dolby on in the settings. Turning that off fixed it. It is still stable with Send data to Apple turned on, and switched back over to Google DNS.\n\nA: I was having similar issues, using my ISP's DNS. What worked for me was disabling \"Send data to Apple\" in the settings.\n", "Q: Unable to mount an NFS share I'm trying to access my (Synology) NAS share through NFS and always get the same issue.  \nFirst, I activated NFS support in my NAS:\n\nThen I set the permissions on the NAS:\n\nMy MBP has the IP 192.168.1.109.\nFrom there it seems OK. a showmount -e 192.168.1.2 shows the list:\n\nExports list on 192.168.1.2:\n/volume1/video                      192.168.1.109\n/volume1/homes                      192.168.1.109\n\nBut unfortunately, my mount always fails:\n\nGroundControl:/ ludo$ sudo mount -t nfs -o rw 192.168.1.2:/volume1/homes /Volumes/home\nmount_nfs: can't mount /volume1/homes from 192.168.1.2 onto /Volumes/home: Operation not permitted\n\nThe /Volume/home directory is created upfront.\nTrying with a non-existing share on the NAS, for example /volume1/qwerty gives a Permission denied error, which is OK.\nBut what is this Operation not permitted error?\nTrying through DiskUtils>NFS Mounts gives the same result.\nWhat did I miss?\n\nA: Or just use the \"resvport\" option with the mount command.\nmount -o resvport nasbox.local.com:/try /mnt\n\n\nA: Finally found the solution in an old forum thread.  \n\nMy solution was to mount with \"-P\" to force the use of a reserved port number, as described in mount_nfs(8) page. \n\nThe solution is then to use the -P option to the mount command.\nNow works like a charm (but doesn't fix my initial issue!)\n", "Q: Terminal text size different when connected to external monitor I have a Macbook Pro 15\" running OS X 10.6.8. When not connected to an external monitor, launching Terminal looks like this. Note the width of the text (almost looks bold).\n\nWhen connected to my 24\" Dell 2408WFP monitor (via Mini DisplayPort to DVI connector), launching Terminal looks like this. Note the skinny non-bold appearance of the text.\n\nEven more odd is Terminal decides on the text style depending on when the app was first launched. If Terminal was initially launched with no external monitor connected, it uses the bold style. If I keep Terminal open and hot connect to my Dell monitor, all subsequent new Terminal windows will use the bold style. If I exit Terminal and relaunch, it uses the skinny non-bold text.\nThis behavior is really annoying as I prefer the non-external monitor bold appearance.\nOddly, at work I have an iMac connected to a 24\" Apple Cinema Display and all Terminal instances uses the bold style text. I suspect Terminal on startup is detecting the monitor(s) and doing something to the text style.\nIs there anyway to disable this behavior?\nFollow-Up: I'm seeing this behavior in other applications such as iTerm and Firefox. I suspect it's a operation system issue.\n\nA: After some searching, this appears to be a known issue. OS X somehow isn't fully aware my Dell monitor, and is not applying the same font smoothing. The font smoothing can be set using:\ndefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2\n\nSee this superuser and macrumors threads.\n", "Q: Can't enable File Sharing under OSX Lion So I've upgraded to Lion, but now I can't enable File Sharing, when I press the checkbox, it simple shows the \"correct\" symbol and in less than half of a second it removes it again.\nThis happens the same for the 2 checkboxes under the Options... as well.\nWhat can I do to enable File Sharing again?\n\n\n\nA: It turns out it's not only me, but following this amazing tutorial everything whent smooth and worked out nicely...\n\n", "Q: NFS, AFP, SMB... Advantages and drawbacks on a Mac OS system Struggling to fix several issues since I switched to Lion (see here and there), I came across several ways of connecting network shares to my MBP: NFS, AFP, SMB, CIFS (maybe others).\nWhat are the differences between all these protocols and what is the one giving the more advantages to a MacOS system?\n\nA: I tend to see AFP and SMB/CIFS as end user methods, NFS can easily be used on OS X as an autofs system for automatically mounting everything from one or more file server.\nGenerally AFP and SMB/CIFS you need to use Finder, but NFS you can simply jump to /net and start visiting any host.\nAFP is going to support Apple's resource forks and attributes natively, SMB/CIFS will by default dump these attributes into a new folder .DS_Store everywhere.\nThe document Mac OS X Server File Services Administration has a useful chapter titled \"Understanding File Services\" which also introduces the differences.\n\nA: I'm writing this comment in 2016, Apple defaults now to SMB, however MacOs performance remains abysmal in SMB. On Gigabit ethernet, it's generally 40% slower (50 to 75 MB/s in SMB vs 80 to 120 MB/s in AFP or NFS). With 10GigEthernet, it's even worse: SMB tops at 250 MB/s, while AFP reaches happily 1 GB/s and maxes out the link.\nI'm making comparisons using high-end linux storage servers from various client machines. A comparable Windows or Linux client maxes out 1 GgigE link on SMB (100-120 MB/s), and reaches 800 MB/s or more with 10 GigE. It's really MacOS SMB client implementation that sucks rocks.\n\nA: Essentially, NFS is the Unix way of doing network shares, AFP is the Apple way, and SMB/CIFS (they're basically the same thing) is the Microsoft way. AFP will generally work best with a MacOS system (except that most third-party implementations are currently struggling to catch up with a change made in Lion where an older and less secure authentication method was dropped) because it's better integrated with OS X authentication and with Time Machine.\n\nA: The link (Mac OS X Server File Services Administration) returns a damaged file when trying to open. Tracked it down to this:\nhttp://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/FileServerAdmin_v10.6.pdf\n", "Q: Using Gmail with Mail, Google Calendar with iCal I currently use Gmail and Google Calendar for my primary email and calendar system. I've been using them both through the web interface so I can best take advantage of all the features. However I'm considering switching to Mail & iCal, and I'm trying to figure out what I will and won't be able to do. (I already set up syncing with Mail & Calendar on my iPhone, and Address Book on both my iPhone and Mac.)\nHere are the features I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard shortcuts in Gmail\n\n*Several alternate email addresses that are forwarded to and fetched by my primary Gmail account\n\n*\n\n*When I reply to an email that was sent to one of these addresses, Gmail automatically picks that address to send from\n\n*Sending mail from plus-addresses (e.g. me+test@gmail.com)\n\n\n*Priority Inbox (\"Important\" messages, as determined by Gmail's algorithm, appear at the top of my inbox)\n\n*Labels, which appear next to the message subject in my inbox\n\n*In Google Calendar, I have added a couple public calendars that I can view events from.\n\n\nAre all of these features easy to sync with Mail and iCal? In particular, how do I set up the ability to send from my other addresses? Will I have to add my other accounts separately in Mail (and if so, will I still be able to view them when I visit gmail.com on another device)?\n\nA: Keyboard shortcuts: Mail has it's own keyboard shortcuts, which you may have to learn.\nAlternate email addresses/multiple accounts: works fine. Don't know about plus-addresses. \nPriority inbox: this is not supported.\nLabels work, as does flagging.\nPublic calendars work in iCal.\nSyncing is very easy to set up - via IMAP in Mail, and in Preferences in iCal. In Lion it's even simpler. \nYes, you add each account separately in mail. You can still visit them in any browser or device.\n", "Q: is there anyway to add a song to an existing specific playlist from my ipod touch If I am listening to all my music and I hear a song and I think it would be great to add to a certain playlist (lets say a playlist i called \"gym mix\", is there anyway to do this from the iPod touch itself, instead of having to remember this and them do it from iTunes when i am at my computer.  This seems like a basic function but i can't find it anywhere\n\nA: Assuming you're running the latest iOS:\nSelect a playlist. Select \"Edit\" from the buttons at the top of the playlist under the search field. Tap the \"+\" in the top left of the toolbar. Find the song(s) you want, and hit the \"+\" to the right of their name. Tap \"Done\" when finished.\n", "Q: does the iphone do RGB sub-pixel rendering? I've heard of RGB Sub-Pixel Rendering.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm wondering does the IPhone 3 have this capability (or is it that each pixels are only 1 color) ?\n\n*What about the IPhone 4?\n\nA: No, they don't:\n\n...sub-pixel anti-aliasing is, ultimately, a clever hack that will eventually fall by the wayside as display resolutions improve.\n\n\nA: They don't. The native resolution of even the original iPhone screen was high enough that there would be little added benefit.\nAlso note that each orientation of the screen would require a different set of subpixel rendering calculations. So it would also be more complicated to implement.\nCombined, there's no advantage to use subpixel rendering on an iOS device.\n", "Q: Can I convert a HFS+ volume to HFSX (case sensitive) without extra software tools? After upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion with added volume encryption along the way, my boot partition wasn't case sensitive any more. Is there a way to convert it back to being case sensitive without reformatting? I know that iPartition claims to be able to do this, but I'm a little hesitant to shell out money for a tool that I'd probably use exactly once.\n\nA: Sadly, no. \nYour money or your time surely will soon be spent.\n", "Q: Change keyboard shortcut for {} and [] in German keyboard layout I'm new to Mac and using a Macbook Air with Lion and a German keyboard. From my PC I'm used to other keyboard shortcuts for {} and [].\nCurrently it's alt + 8,9 for {} and alt + 5,6 for []. Can I change this to the PC ones (cmd + 7,0 and cmd + 8,9)?\n\nA: Try Ukulele. It's a keyboard layout editor for Mac OS X.\n\nA: I've managed to create these shortcuts with Spark: http://www.shadowlab.org/softwares/spark.php\n", "Q: iMac is warming I've 22 inch iMac. I am using it about 1 year and just noticed that the top back of the screen is very hot as i can't put my hand about half a minute on it.\nI've googled some and downloaded istat Pro. Here are the temperatures of my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDD: 56 degree celcius\n\n*CPU: 51 deg.cel.\n\n*GPU Diode: 69 deg.cel.\n\n*GPU Heatsink: 67deg.cel.\n\n*Mem Controller: 57 deg.cel.\n\n*Optical Drive: 50 deg.cel.\n\n*Power supply: 59 deg.cel.\n\n\nAre these values normal? or something going wrong with my computer?\nBy the way, i am not sure if there is any relationship but, i ve just upgraded to Mac OS X Lion. is it irrelevant or? \n\nA: Short answer: Those values are okay for a computer that is or has recently been under load.\nIf you're getting these when it's just sitting idle, something may be wrong. However, if you're getting these while the computer is doing some work (or has recently done some work) these are reasonable. (I have a 22\" iMac that I'm comparing yours to)\nAs for the top of the glass: The (one and only) fan vent is on the back of the computer near the top (where you're putting your hand). It's normal for that area to get very hot, as all the heat the computer generates passes through there. Mine gets hot after a while even if the computer hasn't been working hard.\nIf you're worried, you can check out the max temperature specs for your components. My iMac has this processor. As you can see under Package Specifications-> Tcase, the maximum temperature it can stand is 72.6* C, comfortably over your CPU's temperature (our models probably have similar maximum temperatures)\n", "Q: Can Mail count unread messages (for the Dock icon) from only some of my accounts? I have 7 mail accounts configured with Apple Mail. The dock icon shows the count of new emails for all of my accounts. How can I disable notification for 2 of those 7 accounts, so it just shows me the counter for the other 5 accounts?\n\nA: Do a SmartMailbox with the folders from which you want the counts to come, and then select that in Mail's General settings --> \"Dock unread count\" (it's the fourth drop down list)\n\nA: I'm not aware of a way to do this natively, but DockStar offers this kind of functionality, among other things. Their FAQ states that the latest version supports Lion, as well.\n", "Q: Adding Facebook profiles to Address Book I see that Address Book has a field for entering a friend's Facebook profile. However, many of my friends don't have an actual facebook username (ie a profile at facebook.com/username), but just the old user ID (facebook.com/profile.php?id=blah). Is there any way to make it work with those?\nAlso, how can I sync information from Facebook (eg birthdays) with my address book? Is there a way to do that and veto updates, like with iSync? Sometimes people have fake information on Facebook.\n\nA: You can copy the URL for your friend's profile on Facebook, and paste it into the Facebook profile field in the card editor.  Disregard the fact that the editor shows \"User Name\" placeholder text in this field; the URL works fine.  After saving the card, you can click on the Facebook label to the left of the URL, and you'll get a menu that includes \"View Profile\" and \"View Photos\".\nI tested this on Lion both when using a profile URL, and when using a new Facebook username.  The \"View Photos\" action does not work when saving a profile URL, but both actions work when saving a Facebook username.\n\nA: The tool that best matches what you're trying to do is http://danauclair.com/addressbooksync/ (that I know of).\nThough it works under Lion, I do not believe it is Lion aware (as of 06 Aug 2011) hence it does not make use of the new \"Profile->Facebook\" field. Matching is done by heuristic, as far as I can see.\nWhile addressbooksync allows some manual match-up and specifying of fields to sync, it isn't comprehensive. Fake and/or incomplete information will be synced; it will not ask you for confirmation.\n", "Q: No music contents on iPhone after synchronization Every time I synchronize my iPhone with iTunes on my computer, for example, when I want to add new music to my iPhone, I suddenly lose all my music on the iPhone.\nI recently wanted to add a new album to my iPhone. So I plugged it in via USB, checked the album for synchronization in iTunes and started synchronization. After a while it finished and said \"Synchronization done. You can disconnect your iPhone now blah blah…\".\nBut when I looked at my iPhone and opened the iPod app, it says: \"No contents\". How is this possible? In iTunes there is an overview telling you how much space is full and what the space is used for. There I see 4,5 GB for Apps, 7 GB for music and some space for other stuff. On my iPhone I can check the space too, and there it also says that there should be the 7 GB of music, but the iPod app doesn't show any contents.\nI also tried to restore my iPhone multiple times with different back-ups. It works until I sychnronize my iPhone the next time. Another strange thing is that restoring my iPhone isn't easy at all. It often aborts, showing random error messages (6,9,14). This is really annoying and I'm about to throw my iPhone against a wall.\nHas anyone had similar problems and found a solution?\niPhone:  \n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 4 (32 GB)\n\n*iOS 4.3.5\n\n*no jailbreak\n\n\nPC:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes 10.4.0.80\n\n*Windows 7 64\n\n\nA: I think this might be your problem: Windows 7 64\nIf you can, try to sync your phone from a 32 bit machine. Since the dawn of the iPhone Apple hasn't played nicely with 64 bit flavors of Windows. This fellow says there's a HotFix from MSFT to fix the issue.\n", "Q: What is the difference between sync-ing my iPhone and backing-up my iPhone? What do they mean?  If I sync my iPhone will anything change on it?  Does my iPhone have to have the same data as my iTunes account?  (Because it doesn't - by design.)  If I get a new iPhone when the iPhone 5 comes out, will I be able to copy everything from my Mac to the iPhone via sync (or backup)?\nIs there an Apple webpage with the definitive word on this?\nThanks,\nNo One in Particular\n\nA: Backup means copying your personal data from your phone to your computer. That includes application settings, text messages, voicemails, etc.\nSync means copying new apps, music, video, or books from iTunes to your phone, or from your phone to iTunes.\nYou can think of it this way: backup saves a copy of stuff you've created, and sync copies media you have downloaded via the iTunes Store.\nBackup copies everything, but Sync only copies what you choose through iTunes. By default, it copies everything, but you can fine tune it all you want. You might want to stop movies from syncing to your phone if you never use it to watch movies, for example.\nUnless you've changed the settings, when you connect your iPhone to your computer, iTunes always performs a backup first, then a sync.\nWhen you connect a new iPhone to your computer, iTunes will offer to reconfigure it using the latest backup it has. So if you connect your old iPhone, let it backup/sync, then connect your new iPhone, it should transfer everything so that your new phone is just like your old one, but faster!\n\nA: Syncing your iOS device to iTunes\nSyncing your iOS device with iTunes allows you to copy information(more detailed list below) to your iOS device from you computer and vice versa. Here is an Apple support article on backing up your iOS device which provides more details.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1386\nAs per the article you can sync the following\n\n*\n\n*Applications\n\n*Audio content—music, podcasts, audiobooks, and iTunes U content\n\n*Bookmarks\n\n*Books\n\n*Contacts\n\n*Calendars\n\n*Movies and TV shows\n\n*Photos\n\n*Notes\n\n*Documents (File Sharing apps only)\n\n*Ringtones\n\n\nBacking up and Restoring your iOS device\nWhen you connect your iOS device to your computer it will perform a backup before it will continue to sync automatically. A backup saves all the information on your iOS device to your computer so that if you get a new iOS device or in your case an iPhone 5 your computer will ask you if you would like to perform a restore which will copy all of your settings from your old device to your new device. And here is another Apple support article about syncing your iOS device.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1414\n\nA: 1 - Sync\nCopies new data from your iPhone (or other device) to iTunes and removes deleted data. Also does the same backwards from iTunes to your device.\nSo to answer your question, yes things might change here and there, but only to make the devices \"match\" each other in the end.\nNote that SYNC also does BACKUP as one of its steps!\nYou should sync if you downloaded new media, apps, or updates.\n2 - Backup\nSimply creates a \"snapshot\" of your device. Can be used to \"roll back\" your device to this state if it acts wacky one day.\nOf course you should do this only when your device is feeling awesome and shiny (or before you give it to your 2-year old niece to mess up all the apps in it).\n3 - Restore\nRestores your device to the state when it was feeling awesome and shiny.\n\n", "Q: How to avoid a kernel panic during Lion install to USB disk? I downloaded Lion from the Mac App Store, and have been trying to install it to a 32GB USB flash drive. I want to be able to boot my Mac from this disk to use Lion and test some things out before I upgrade my Mac's main hard disk.\nI formatted the drive (GUID partition map) per the Lion Installer's instructions, and was able to select it as an installation target. On three separate attempts, the installer begins installing files and gets about 2/3 of the way through before being interrupted by a kernel panic.\nI had the Installer Log window open, but nothing interesting/unusual appeared there. After rebooting, I'm able to view it at /private/var/log/install.log on the target disk, the last message is simply a status message about extracting a package. No warnings or errors appear in the file.\nThe last line of the install log is:\nJul 31 17:02:54 brs-macbook-pro OSInstaller[358]: PackageKit: Extracting file://localhost/Volumes/Mac%20OS%20X%20Install%20DVD/Packages/German.pkg (destination=/Volumes/Skunkworks/.OSInstallSandbox-tmp/Root, uid=0)\n\nThe preceding lines are more of the same.\nThe disk is a brand new SanDisk Cruzer 32GB.\nPlease note that I am NOT trying to create a bootable installer disk. I want to use the disk to boot into Lion, log in, and use the computer.\nAny ideas why it might be failing and how to correct it?\n\nA: Seeking clarification\nPlease add to the opening question a note of whether the panic occurs during: \na) the preparation stage of installation (before the first automated restart of the system)\nor\nb) post-preparation, the installation stage (between the first and second automated restarts). \nLogging the preparation and installation stages of installation\nScreenshots at http://www.wuala.com/grahamperrin/public/2011/08/01/a/?mode=gallery demonstrate the Installer Log window in foreground whilst Mac OS X Installer runs — the installation stage. \nDuring either stage (preparation or installation) you can present a log window by keying:\n\n\n*\n\n*command-L\nWith luck, you might see — possibly greyed-out beneath the foreground detail of the panic — the point at which panic occurs. \nAt the root of the volume to which installation is attempted: if installation fails you may find a directory:\nMac OS X Install Data\nWithin that directory, a log. If present, that log may be informative to you, but not as useful (to readers here) as the .panic file. \nPRAM, kernel panic information and the .panic file\nApple's Mac OS X: What's stored in PRAM tells us that recent kernel panic information is stored in PRAM. If the first normal start following a panic does not present the customary dialogue, you should wonder whether/how that information was lost from PRAM. \nIf the kernel panic occurs during the installation stage — and if the subsequent start defaults to attempt continuation of the installation, or Mac OS X Utilities (not a normal start) — and if you are without an obvious interface to kernel panic information — then my hunch would be that whilst started in that special mode, the path to which a .panic file might normally be written is read-only … \n… if that's the case and if you're comfortable at the command line, maybe start in single user mode following the panic then use the following command to see whether panic information is legible on screen: \nnvram -p\n(For the number of ifs above, apologies!)\n\nA: Boot with verbose mode (hold down command-v), then it will show some text to help you diagnose why it kernel panics - the relevant kexts etc.\nThe fact that it crashes while installing means the Lion image may be corrupted, you might wanna perform an MD5 to verify it.\n\nA: So, I got it to work in the end by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Disk Utility to burn InstallESD.dmg to a DVD, creating an install disc.\n\n*Booting the installer from that DVD.\n\n*Having the DVD installer immediately say \"there was a problem\" and I should \"try reinstalling\";\n\n*Using the Utilities menu to launch Terminal, killing the installer app, which caused it to relaunch and give me an opportunity to reinstall. (It was just dumb luck that the first thing I tried worked.)\n\n*Installing to the USB Disk.\n\n\nThis time it ran to completion, though it was kind of a hollow victory: the disk I chose has abysmally slow data transfer rates, making it really painful to use.\nI can't be sure, but the slowness of the drive is possibly responsible for the kernel panic to begin with.\n", "Q: Getting \"not eligible to build\" error when updating iPad 2 to 4.3.3 I'm trying to update my iPad 2 firmware to 4.3.3 but iTunes is giving me a \"not eligible to build\" error.

Which OS x version did you have previously?\n", "Q: What is the transfer speed of AirDrop? Tried transferring 4gb file yesterday and seems to be taking such a long time. Anyone knows the transfer speed?\nIt may help to say that I'm using last year's AirPort Extreme.\nEDIT: Two years later, I wonder: what about in 802.11ac? If the laptops supports 802.11ac but the router does not, what will the speed be?\n\nA: Just tested the theory of faster AirDrop speeds between computers in different networks and it is true. The difference in speeds were from 1MB/s to approx. 5MB/s. So 500% increase. I saw a transfer of 8.58 GB go from an expected 2,5 hours to about 33 minutes.\nWhen you transfer files be on different networks or on none at all.\n\nA: I have been noticing varying speeds between my laptops (Macbook Pro 13' 2010 and Macbook Pro 13' 2011). Sometimes the speed is quite fast, and sometimes it is awfully slow.\nI suspect that if the two computer are connected on the same wireless network, the speed is slow (as the files travel through my contemptible router).\nOn the other hand, if the Macbooks Pro are not connected on the same network, the transfer seems to be way faster.\nI have not thoroughly tested this so we would need confirmation.\n\nA: AirDrop works outside of whatever WiFi networks are around and doesn't need a base station. It is like a mesh network where all the devices just talk between each other. If nothing else is \"sharing\" the road  - you get the full speed. The further away you are or the more interference, the slower it gets. AirDrop will work by passing the data from Mac to Mac so it will get the file there (although slower) if it has to jump once or twice along the way.\nThat being said, for two close machines, the transfer speed should be the max wireless speed between your two machines. Hard drives are almost always faster reading and writing than WiFi speeds, so the radio link is generally the slowest.\nHowever, all of that is just theoretical. You can check your actual speed by opening Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor\nClick the Network tab on the bottom and you should see stats about how fast the data is being sent and received. Detach from WiFi base stations to let AirDrop get all the hardware if you want the fastest transfers - leave it on if you need internet while dropping that large file.\n\n\nA: I just tested with a friend's MacBook Pro and mine. Found it to be around 30x faster. If you connect to the network, it sends data through the router. So disconnect both computers from all networks and see for yourself.\n", "Q: Is there a default SSH password on Mac OS X? If I create an account, and don't give it a password, what's the password to SSH it?\n\nA: Having no password on the OS level effectively means that ssh is disabled for that user. The protocol insists on a non-zero password and thus the hashes of whatever password is supplied fails to match the absence of a hash.\nYou must supply ssh keys or otherwise arrange some authentication to log in should your account have no password.\n\nA: Interesting question.  I don't know the answer, but if OS X behaves like other UNIXes (and I suspect it does), it is possible to for a userid to exist without a password.  In that case, the login is disabled and incoming ssh connections will prompt for a password but nothing will satisfy the requirement to authenticate.\n\nA: You could put your public key into the authorized_keys of the account you were trying to ssh into and you wouldn't be prompted for a password anymore.\n", "Q: Does the 2011 Macbook Air come with a OS reinstall USB drive? Reading through other questions I learned that the 2010 Air came with one, but I don't remember noticing any USB drives when I unboxed my 2011 Air (days ago).\n\nA: According to Apple.com it does not:\n\nIn the Box\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air\n\n*45W MagSafe Power Adapter, AC wall plug, and power cord\n\n*Printed and electronic documentation\n\n\nThe air uses Internet Recovery to boot from Apple's servers and then recreate the Recovery HD if needed to re-install Lion (which also will download from the internet). You will only need media if you can't get to an internet connection and have the existing Recovery HD go bad.\n\nA: I bought a MacBook Air this afternoon (2011 version) and it did not contain a USB drive for re-installing software.\n\nA: Since the release of Mac OS X Lion (10.7), there is no installer media. The OS is downloaded over the Internet from the Mac App Store, and reinstalled from a recovery partition that is created on the hard drive.\nEventually, Apple will allow you to purchase a USB drive that contains the OS. For now, you can make your own (or burn a DVD).\nIt is expected that your computer didn't come with a USB drive for the OS, and the other models no longer come with DVDs.\n", "Q: Lion deletes files after copying to shared folder on AFP I have an iMac 27\" (late 2009) running Lion OS X with all latest patches.\nThere is an external USB drive (Mac partition, journalled), on which I have created a network share using AFP.\nSince yesterday, another Lion machine (the source) trying to save files to the share will copy the files, but at the end of the process the files are nowhere to be found on the target (i.e. my machine).\nIt was working yesterday because I have a folder there with yesterday's date.\nI have stopped and started sharing, tried with different shares and permissions, turned off the Firewall, and various other things to try fixing this.\nThe only thing that I know has changed since yesterday afternoon is that I upgraded iLife to version 2011 (with associated updates from Software Update).\nBehaviour: files can be seen copying (grayed out), and at the end of the process, have vanished. From the source machine, everything appears normal. In other words, the files are disappearing after they finish copying.\nSide note: if a folder is copied, the folder itself is created, but the files inside are copied and then deleted but the folder remains.\nFurther note: AirDrop does work, but I don't want to use it because it's the 21st century and network shares should work by now.\nAny thoughts are welcome.\nEDIT: When I try to overwrite the folder that has already been created (see above), it tells me (at the source) that the folder is in use and cannot be changed.\nSECOND EDIT: After repairing permissions on both iMacs, things appear to be working again, but I will monitor the situation and update this question in a day or two anyway.\n\nA: As noted in my second edit, repairing permissions appears to have fixed the problem, though I don't see how.\n", "Q: Add info to Dock/Menubar from Shell in macOSX I'm working on MacOSX environnement, but I would like to tweak it a bit.\nI have a few bash scripts I used in Linux to retrieve infos such as IP, average ping and so, that I would like to be displayed in a persistant place. (I.E. the doc, or the menu bar).\nI did not found any documentation on this topic, can someone provide a few link or the name of the correct man page to read about that?\nthanks\n\nA: I just found this: https://github.com/stretchr/bitbar.\nWorks like a charm.\n\nA: The Dock and menu bar are both for use by applications only. Dock icons are managed by the NSDockTile class, and items on the right side of the menu bar are managed by NSStatusItem. If you want to display this information in one of those places, you'll have to create an application to do so. (If you can't convert your bash scripts to C/Obj-C, you can use NSTask to run them.)\n\nA: How about a small tool: shellwrangler? - http://shellwrangler.com\n", "Q: How to select which iOS device receives push notifications (for Facebook) I've got an iPad 2 and an iPhone 3GS, both of which have the official Facebook app. Since I set up Facebook on my iPad, only my iPad has been receiving notifications from Facebook. (I think this might also be the case with other apps.)\nIdeally I'd like to receive notifications on both devices. Is this possible?\nIf not, how do I select which device receives notifications? Is it a simple matter of turning off notifications for a given app on one device, and leaving them on for the other?\n\nA: Just of note that Facebook is notorious for being extremely flakey when delivering notifications of any kind (whether they be system wide through the home screen icon, or even in-app). If you have Push enabled on both devices, the problems could lie within Facebook.\nAlso note that it may (read: should) be the case that when you check your account on one device, the notifications should disappear on the other, as they will be marked as read.\nAdditionally, it could be that Facebook's servers deliver a notification only once to any waiting device capable of handling them (remember they have millions of users to contend with). You'll have to contact Facebook to make certain of this however.\nYou can use mail to test it. If you send yourself an email, do you receive notifications on both devices? If you read the mail, do they disappear (get marked as read) on both devices?\n\nA: Push notifications are device specific. Check your settings, and ensure both devices have them on. \n", "Q: Using \"+Left/Right\" to move between words in an editing window I've recently switched to a MacBook as my main platform for doing work. Previously, I was an all-Linux sort of person (I now run Linux under VMware). But there are still a few UI differences that are driving me crazy, and one of them is this:\nI am used to being able to use ctrl+→/← when in a web form, or even in most editing apps, to move left and right by a whole word. However, on my MBP those keys switch between desktops in Spaces. And where MacOS tends to use the ⌘-key for common control-isms (like ctrl+C, etc.), ⌘+← and ⌘+→` do start-of-line and end-of-line, respectively.\nIs there a modifier for moving by words, under MacOS?\n\nA: *\n\n*⌥← and ⌥→ move word backward or forward\n\n*⌥⇧← and ⌥⇧→ move word backward or forward and modify the selection\n\n*⌥⌫ and ⌥⌦ delete word backward or forward\n\n\nThe same shortcuts with ⌃ substituted for ⌥ are used to navigate subwords in some editors like Xcode and TextMate.\nA reference of the standard text editing shortcuts: hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/System%20Bindings.html\n\nA: Recently updated by Apple for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: \nMac OS X Human Interface Guidelines: Appendix A: Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n… driving me crazy … I am used to being able to use  ctrl+→/← …\n\nI highly recommend adopting the shortcuts given in the guidelines. There'll be a period of craziness whilst you learn the norms, but ultimately it'll make for a better overall experience of the operating system. \nThere may be user-friendly ways of re-mapping things — on a system-wide or per-application basis — but my personal experience of remapping things (years ago) is that eventually, despite best intentions, there'll be some unexpected conflict or muddle, after which you could find yourself not only choosing to learn the norms, but also extracting yourself from a muddle (making painful the deferred learning). \nA good example of potential for muddle: Terminal in Lion now follows HIG (Human Interface Guidelines), which is good. You might be able to remap things for Terminal but — depending on your uses of Terminal — I imagine the risk of something going horribly wrong. \n\nA: ⌥ + arrow keys will let you navigate by word. As you said, ⌘ + arrow keys will move to the end/beginning of the line or document. Both of these can also be used with ⇧ to select, or the delete key. Furthermore, you can double-click to select a word and triple-click to select a paragraph — and if you double-click-drag or triple-click-drag, you can select multiple words or paragraphs.\nAlso useful, and perhaps familiar to you coming from Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl A moves to the beginning of a paragraph\n\n*ctrl E moves to the end of a paragraph\n\n*fn ⌫ deletes forwards (and can be combined with ⌘ or ⌥;\nyou can also use ctrlD which doesn't work with the other modifiers)\n\n*ctrl K deletes to the end of the paragraph (kill)\n\n*ctrl Y pastes that text back (yank)\n\n*ctrl L scrolls so the selected text is visible\n\n*ctrl T transposes the two characters next to the cursor\n\n*ctrl O inserts a newline after the cursor\n\n\nMore interesting shortcuts and uses of the keyboard can be found here and elsewhere on the internet.\n\nA: Try pressing ⌥ + ← or →.\n                   \n\nA: Use \"Application Shortcuts\" in \"Keyboard Shourtcuts\" of System preferences for assigning a custom key command mapping for system level or individual application. More info can be found by searching for \"How to Remap Keyboard Shortcut in OS X\".\n", "Q: Second SATA drive stopped working (after lion upgrade) Since I upgraded to Lion, my second SATA drive stopped working. The issue occurs only for reading files, not writing. I can unmount it, but I can't rename nor delete files.\nI have two SSDs installed in my MacBook Pro and when I look at 'System Information' it lists both drives. So they are properly recognized. \nHowever, the first drive is listed as:\n\"Solid State SATA\"\n\nand the second (working) one is listed as\n\"Flash Storage\"\n\nBoth drives are formatted as OS X Journaled, so they are of the same format.  \nDoes someone has any idea what's going on over here? And how can I solve this?\n\nA: Have you updated your EFI?  Lots of potential problems depending on the drive and the model of MacBook.\nIn particular it appears that SATA 3.0 drives (6.0 Gbps) are not well supported. The EFI update resolves some problems, but not others. Is the read only drive in the optical bay? That would be consistent with the kind of problems reported.\n\nA: \nIt works for only reading, not writing. I can unmount it, I can't rename files, I can't delete files.\n\nRight click on it in Finder, go to \"Get Info\". In the \"Sharing and Permissions\" at the bottom, click the little lock, type in your password and allow yourself to read and write. Also try checking \"Ignore ownership on this volume\".\nIf that doesn't work, try formatting it with Disk Utility again.\n", "Q: VMware Fusion 2.x not running with 64 Bit Kernel Lion has anyone managed to run fusion 2.x under Mac OS Lion? Since the update it says \nIncompatibility with 64 bit kernel\nThis release of VMware Fusion does not work with 64-bit kernel of Mac OS X, you are currently running.\nTo use VMware Fusion, you must restart your computer using the 32-bit kernel of Mac OS X again.\nAny ideas :( ?\n\nA: Upgrade to VMWare Fusion 3.1 which is compatible with Lion, with limited support from VMWare.\nVMWare's knowledge base says\n\nVMware Fusion 3.1.3 was designed for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and OS X 10.6\n  (Snow Leopard).

Can I watch 3D movies on my Mac? If not, can I just watch them normally in 2D (not having 2 pictures side by side).\n\nA: With VLC on Mac OSX the menu options are different from Windows.\nVLC v2.1.5 menu options are ...\nWindow -> Video Effects\nWhen the Video Effects pop-up window is displayed, select the Miscellaneous tab and tick the Anaglyph option.\n\nA: According to this Apple document:\n\n\nAutodesk’s FBX for QuickTime enables QuickTime as a 3D viewing solution that supports content from any professional 3D package. With FBX for QuickTime, digital artists can share, view, and interact with 3D content seamlessly, efficiently, and at no cost. Now available for both Mac OS X and Windows.\n\n\nSo, I'm guessing that's a yes.\nIf you want to take that 3D movie and convert it to 2D, you can most likely use MPEG Streamclip for that.\n\nA: I tried the suggested VLC technique (on MacOS X) for viewing just one \"side\" of the 3D movie, but can't get it just right. \nReferring to the first answer --- there's no \"Tools\" menu to start with --- what is the Mac equivalent?\nReferring to the last answer --- in the \"Video ->Aspect Ratio ->\" submenu, there are a few fixed aspect ratios, non of which stretches the single side to the desired proportions, and I haven't found a way to add new aspect ratios to the menu.\nAlso, I found  that the best way to remove one side is using the \"crop\" tab in the \"Window->Video Effects...\" dialog, specifying \"1024\" on the right crop (leaving the rest sides with 0 cropping).\nStill this is a partial solution for me in that I can't properly enjoy the movies because of the wrong aspect ratio.\n\nA: Yes. A Mac can display side-by-side 3D content such as 3D content from YouTube and other sources. Furthermore, the refresh rates needed for alternating glasses is easily achieved by Macs produced in the last 10 or more years. The same goes for 3D encoding schemes where half of the screen goes to each eye with a prism or mirror to help the process. Lastly, the encoding that uses color shifting is fine with the resolution for Macs so unless your 3D has some odd requirements that you don't list, the answer is yes.\nWhat you need to see that content in 3D is a 3D display system. I use a pair of Vuzix video eyewear connected to me Mac or, with an alternate Controller (interface box), I can also connect them to my iPhone or iPad and watch 3D content from those as well.\n\nA: Try ATK Player. It presents 3D videos in red-cyan, green-magenta or amber-blue mode. You need a suitable glasses to watch your 3D videos.\n\nA: There are some available color-coded 3D movies available, you need cheap color glasses instead of electric synchronized and extremely costly ones.\nMost common is the famous red-and-blue style.\nCommon cinema movies from like Avatar are displayed in a different brown-and-green color spectrum.\nBut if you want to watch it 2d, then you just have to download VLC, then open your double movie, then select menu \"Video -> Aspect ratio -> *\" then here you will select to double the original width.\nNow when your video looks ok, you just hold the control key and scroll the trackpad to zoom your screen into one of the 2 videos.\nEt voilá!\n\nA: In mac VLC. either go to \"windows\" tab or press command+E. in that go to mice' tab and click on the Anaglyph.. thats it SBS movie will play in normal 3D\n\nA: There are plenty of tutorials on the web on how to watch SBS 3D movies on your mac, such as using VLC player, however how to watch a SBS 3D movie in 2D on a mac is much harder to find. For that you need another player (VLC for mac will not give you a good Aspect Ratio (AR) because there is no option to customize the AR. Windows version does have custom AR). Instead you could download the free media player Sview http://www.sview.ru/en/download/, there are others that can do the same thing this is just one option.\nOnce you open the movie in Sview DO NOT ENLARGE TO FULLSCREEN YET.\nStart by setting it up like so:\nMedia > Stereoscopic Format > Parallel Pair\nChange Device > Dual Output\nView > Stereo Output > Left View\nView > Display Ratio > 2.21:1\nNow you should see your movie in 2D and in the correct AR. It's time to go fullscreen and enjoy.\n\nA: I found a solution\nWindow>Video Effects>Crop> Fill the left side with 1000 px\nEnjoy\nand there is a con... and that is videos will play in 4:3 res if someone can fix that it will be great.\n\nA: hopefully you made it to here. I'm a 3D junkie. First up, no - there is no way to watch standard SBS 3D on mac using VLC, but it is only red and cyan. VLC is safe to download, so no problems there. However, if you have active shutter 3D glasses, it will not work. The best workable alternative is to watch on TV or Projector using a 3D capable blu-ray player. The good news here is there are ways to make 3D movies from 2D movies that make it worth the investment. DVD FAB 12 offers a DVD convertor program that allows you to turn 2D into SBS 3D. It does take a while - like an hour of conversion for 10 minutes of footage. Now you can make your own 3D content. This is the best option because there is very limited 3D content out there. I rip YouTube videos downloaded with 4K Downloader then convert to 3D overnight. This is by far your best option. Try the SONY 3d blu-ray players available from BandHphoto. Pain in the ass, true. But if you love 3D this is totally the way to go.\n\nA: A Mac can display side-by-side 3D content with 3D players, or turn them into 2D files instead.\n", "Q: VNC from Windows gives blank login screen I'm trying to VNC into my MBP running Lion using TightVNC on Win7.\nUnder Screen Sharing I have Allow access for All Users turned on, and Anyone may request permission and VNC viewers may control screen checked.\nWhen I try to connect, it connects fine, but all I see is a screen full of the textured dark grey background used on the login screen.\nIf I log out of my Mac then VNC in, I'm presented with the Login screen proper, can login over VNC and everything works fine, but this is not how I expect VNC to work and not how I require it to work.\nIs there a way to make it so VNC-ing in simply controls the currently logged in user like it usually does?\nAnthony\n\nA: VNC server changed on lion. You can now log in without a vnc password but instead he os users each get their own loginwindow allowing simultaneous log in distinct from what the local display shows. \nSome discussions on what exactly changed can be found here: Are the changes to Lion's screen sharing documented anywhere publicly? \nI do know the mac screen sharing client as well as edovia's iOS screens apps work well with the new lion changes, so there's hope other third party clients can get updated to work better with the new changes. \n\nA: It sounds like you ARE controlling the existing session, just another screen of it (like when you attach a second monitor).  \n\nA: When you get to the grey screen, you need to pretend that the login box is there. You just can't see it. Type your username and password just like you would at any login screen. The grey screen is replaced by the contents of your VNC server's session.\nWhen you observe the all grey screen -\n1. Enter your username, and hit Enter (advances cursor to the next field)\n2. Enter your password, and hit Enter (you should be able to see remote screen)\n", "Q: How do I prevent my iPhone from wrongly auto-correcting a specific word? When I'm writing text in Danish, the iPhone always auto-corrects foto into FOTO which is immensely annoying. How can I prevent that specific suggestion from ever showing up again?\nThis is iOS version 4.2.1. \nFirst I thought that it was matching it with an entry in my address book, but there is no contact with \"FOTO\" in any of the name fields. I'm using several languages, and the bad replacement only shows in Danish and not in German and not in English. I haven't tested other languages.\nBecause my PC with iTunes is not working well, I'd appreciate suggestions different from \"try upgrading iOS it might help\" unless that is a proven fix. I don't want to have to upgrade the phone unless really, really necessary.\nUpdate: \n\n\n*\n\n*As noted in an answer's comment, I don't want to turn off the autocorrect -- I just want it to work right. Thanks.  \n\n*Resetting the keyboard dictionary didn't help.\n\n\nA: Go into the keyboard settings and add a shortcut for the corrected spelling of the word.  I had to do this with my daughter's name, as every time I spelled it, it would come out in capitals.  You can just use a part of the word and it can auto spell the word for you, or you can spell it with a different capitalization and save the corrected version the other way.\nIf you need to use the first part of the word it may not work.  Don't really know, but it worked for me ;-)\n\nA: I had the same problem that it always corrected a word 'support' to 'SUPPORT' I typed to capitals despite resetting my dictionary on multiple occasions.\nI searched in spotlight for 'SUPPORT' and discovered that I had the word 'SUPPORT' as part of a contacts name. I corrected this to 'support' and then this reset the dictionary again for good measure and this fixed the problem completely.\n\nA: iPhone seems to remember your choice when you dismiss an autocorrection in Safari. If that doesn't work for you, you can always take the nuclear option and disable autocorrection altogether: Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Auto-Correction (eller Indstillinger -> Generelt -> Tastatur -> Automatisk rettelse hvis du benytter dansk på din iPhone)\n\nA: You can try reseting the keyboard dictionary by going to:\nSettings –> General –> Reset –> Reset Keyboard Dictionary\nWarning before you try this - this will erase all of the auto correct entries you have added to the dictionary since you got the phone. But I've had success in doing this when it kept auto correcting as to a's.\n\nA: Although this is a super-old question, I thought I'd add an update for what has worked for me in iOS8, as the autocorrect seems to have become 10 times more annoying: constantly changing Christmas to CHRISTMAS and my name (Lawrie) to - inexplicably - 'lAwrie'. \nOpen up Notes and type the word you want that autocorrect keeps screwing up (in my case, Christmas). As you're typing, it may suggest the correct spelling word on either side of the autocorrect suggestion, or have the 'literal' word you're typing in quotes. Select the one you want. Now do this about 3 times. You should find that, by the third or fourth time, it won't try to all-caps your word, or randomly throw capital letters in the middle of your name. After that, it should autocorrect the word correctly every time, and there's no need to wipe your dictionary.\nNote: The inline autocorrect has changed in iOS8 and is now part of the autosuggestions bar, below the typing area. If you don't see it when you're typing, there should be a thin grey bar with a white line in the centre - flick that up and you'll see it. When it's going to autocorrect a word for you, it's highlighted in blue; otherwise it's just a suggestion.\n\nA: Type the word you want e.g. Christmas. It will correct to CHRISTMAS. Hold down on the word and choose the option 'define' and choose 'Christmas' and it will probably not auto-capitalize the whole word again.\n", "Q: Paragon-NTFS only let me save files into NTFS Drive from Finder Application I just upgraded my Mac OS into Lion.

It is a filesystem error related to writing to the NTFS disk. I'm guessing that the version of Paragon NTFS you have isn't compatible with Lion. Looking at Paragon's forum for Paragon they have v9.0 which should work better.\nYou can also check out the OSXFUSE project which provides similar support for writing to NTFS.\n\nA: Use Tuxera NTFS, it solves the problem!\n", "Q: How to convert an exiting partition to RAID on OS X? I just replaced my optic drive from MacBook Pro with another 500gb HDD and I want to speedup one of the partitions.\nThe first drive has two partitions, named 106 and 107 and I want to convert one of them to use the second drive.\nThe problem is that disk utility does not let me add any of the partitions from the first disk to a RAID set.\nWhat should I do? I don't want to reinstall everything.\nHere is what I would like to obtain from my 2 500gb HDD:\n\n\n*\n\n*one striped partition of 2*300GB, this would be used for speed (compilation)\n\n*rest of the free space other partitions,\n\n*still be able to have a partition with Windows on it, a real partition.\n\n\nA: Enabling a RAID is destructive to the existing data using disk utility and native OS X tools. \nYou will need to have a temporary copy of the data to re-load it onto the new RAID volume.\nI know several people that always set up their externals to be in a RAID so they can always mirror up existing drives after the fact to duplicate, snapshot or extend/stripe them after they have data on them. \nNever been worth the hassle for me to set things up that way, but it works long term for many. \n\nA: Unfortunately you have to format everything first.\nEasiest way will be to use Superduper! or similar software to make an image of your current setup on another disk, then create the RAID array and restore the image back.\n", "Q: Mac Pro 2008 graphics card crashing I have a mac pro 2008, and the graphics card (nvidia 8800GT) has started to lock up - I can still move the mouse but cannot do anything in Windows 7 (I hardly use OSX latelly so dont know if it happens there).  The entire screen goes all garbled (various colours, flashing) and I have to reboot the machine.\nThe latest nvidia drivers for windows 7 have been installed, and until now everything has been rock solid.  \nDoes this sound like the graphics card is failing?  Or do I just need to tweak the cooling / fan speed on the card itself?  \nIf I do need to replace the card, can anyone recommend a decent replacement that would handle most current-gen PC games?  \n\nA: It does sound like the graphics card is failing. The garbled display is a symptom of this. \nIf you only run Windows, any PC graphics card in your Mac Pro will work fine. \nWhat's more, the PC Radeon 58xx and 68xx cards work in OS X too, out of the box. \nI would recommend one of Radeon 5850, 5870, 6850 or 6870 if you want Mac compatibility, or any good graphics card within your budget if you only want to game in Windows.\n", "Q: Why does my MacBook Pro take so long to go to sleep?

Your RAM contents are written to the disk, in the default sleep mode, called \"Safe sleep\", which takes longer the more RAM you have. You can modify this with the PMSet command in terminal. \nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nand then reboot.\nIf you disable this option, you can also remove the sleepimage file from /var/vm, and reclaim 8GB of hard disk space. Do note that you will lose data then if you sleep for too long and the battery dies. \n\nA: I used to have an episode of slow boot, shutdown, sleep and hibernate. When I turn on verbose mode during boot-up, it was stuck at \"Waiting for DSMOS\" for a long time. See this link. To solve it, see this link.\nThereafter, all my slow-downs were gone.\n\nA: Do you by any chance have a firewire device plugged in? If I try to sleep my Macpro (tower) with an older iSight camera plugged in via Firewire, it takes 10-20 seconds to sleep, vs the normal 2-3.\n", "Q: What scenarios benefit from Mac OS X allowing apps to run when no document windows remain? As a rule of thumb programs on Mac OS X stay running when you close all their document windows.\nThis is the behavior I noticed in MacVim, VmWare Fusion, Chrome and host of other applications.\nI personally find this of no use and frankly quite annoying, although having had some number of experiences confirming that my opinion is not always the prevailing in a given target group, I assume that there could be a reason for this decision.\nWhat are scenarios where this function could be useful?\n\nA: When you are using Windows and you open an application like MS Word or Adobe Photoshop, it will open up the application window with some sort of empty background. When you do this on a Mac however, there is no background, there is simply the menu options in the very top bar. So say you had a file open in Photoshop in Windows and you closed that file, you would see the same blank application window that you saw when you started up Photoshop. On a Mac, you will see the menu in the top bar, but again, since there is no background you simply see the desktop. So really, there is no difference in the way that Windows and Mac OS X handle the applications, other than one had a visible window and the other doesn't.\nThe benefit of doing it the OS X way: If you DO plan on keeping the application open, it keeps you from having to minimize the app like you would in windows. All you have to do it click on something else in the background and it will make the applciation lose focus. To close it, simply right click on the application icon in the dock and choose 'Quit'.\n\n\nA: The upside of this behavior is that it caters to users that wish to enjoy the difference between having to launch an entire application framework or just open a new document within an already running app.\nYou can set those apps to launch at log in if you have enough RAM or just a pokey CPU. The virtual memory system will sort out what pages you need swapped to disk and which can remain in RAM. \nAs long as the apps leak memory slowly, it is a great plan to not quit any app you may use again. \nIt's basic performance tuning - re-use work, divide the work into chunks, get the work done before the user is waiting for it.\n\nA: Fundamentally, OSX and Windows have different approaches to top-level windows.  In Windows, the window contains the entire application instance including the menu bar.  In OSX, the window contains the open document, which explains why you can have an application displaying only a menu bar.  \nKeep in mind that the handling of \"empty\" applications will be changing in the near future as more and more applications are updated for Lion.  The common behaviour will be that document-based applications that have no documents opened (as opposed to things like Calculator) will indicate to the OS that it can shut the app down when no documents are open.  The idea is that there will be less of a need to manage which applications are open.\nSee John Siracusa's detailed Lion review for more on this.\n\nA: Interpretation\nBased on the accepted answer, I see two aspects to the question: \n\n\n*\n\n*whether an application should run without windows\n\n*which windows should present when an application runs.\n\n\nAutomatic and sudden termination\nRecommended reading for any user of Lion concerned about running applications: \n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X Application Programming Guide: The Core Application Design: The Application Life Cycle: Automatic and Sudden Termination of Applications Improve the User Experience\nA highlight: \n\n… the system … is better equipped to handle the job. Users do not need to manage processes manually …\n\nQuit quitting!\nIf well-written applications are used, and if the user can break a habit of quitting applications (a habit learnt from less intelligent systems) then: \n\n\n*\n\n*allowing the Lion system to manage things can result in a vastly improved user experience.\n\n\nIt takes a leap of faith to work in this way — without command-q — but many user reports do confirm what's suggested by Apple. \nShift key suppression of windows\nSometimes comparable to discarding windows. \nIn Mac OS X 10.7 (Build 11A511): without changing global or application-specific settings for restoration of windows (a feature of the Transparent App Lifecycle (TAL)), applications respond in different ways to use of the shift key before the application is launched. \nExamples\nNeoOffice 3.2.1 Beta Patch 0 respects the shift key. If a saved file was open at quit time, then shift key before launch will suppress restoration of the window to that file. If in addition you prefer nothing at launch (a feature that's independent of the TAL) you'll get nothing. \n\nPreview 5.5 (719) respects the key. If only saved files were open before quit, then shift key will cause Preview to present nothing, no windows. \nSafari 5.1 (7534.48.3) respects the key. If your preference for new windows is an empty page, and if you were browsing various pages before quit, then shift key before launch will cause presentation of just one window, an empty page. \nTerminal 2.2 (297) and TextEdit 1.7 (288) behave in ways that are consistent with Preview and Safari. \nFor each application, a different logic may apply but essentially, at launch time: \n\n\n*\n\n*shift key should suppress something. \n\n\nMail 5.0 (1244.2/1244.3) seems to ignore the key. If you have multiple viewer windows, the activity window and a window to a received message: all of those will be restored. This inconsistency smells buggy and should be fed to Apple; I expect Mail to present at least one window (viewer), not everything. \nHint\nDo not release the shift key too soon. \nSide note: resuming editions\nEditions that were unsaved before quit are usually resumed as editions. \nIn some environments, editions that were unsaved before quit are not resumed. When you open any such file you should find that the system (not you) saved a version. \n\nA: *\n\n*Applications that take a lot of time to open can be kept running on the background even if they have no open windows\n\n*Applications without open documents don't have to display an empty window that covers the screen\n\n*You can close the last window of an application and open a new one without having to quit and reopen the application\n\n", "Q: VNC Vinagre to OS X Lion I've got a Linux Ubuntu 10.10 machine running Vinagre (VNC client) and I can't seem to be able to connect to my spanking new Mac mini on Lion.  All I get on the Vinagre side is a blank screen.\n\nA: Vinagre doesn't seem to work very well when trying to connect to OS X. I have been trying to connect to Snow Leopard now to no avail. It keeps requesting that I supply a username which it shouldn't\nI found that tigerVNC worked fine (it does not ask for a username), its not the most up to date application, but at least it connects. Hope this helps.\n\nA: VNC Vinagre needs an update to cope with the Lion changes.\nYou could:\n\n\n*\n\n*use another client that works well with the Lion\n\n*use another VNC server on Lion and not use the system server\n\n\nWe're still looking to nail down the changes that Lion made, but it's clear the new VNC server doesn't work well with a handful of existing clients that worked before an upgrade to Lion.\nAre the changes to Lion's screen sharing documented anywhere publicly?\n\nA: Some things that can help VNC clients with Lion.  1) Log out of the destination machine, 2) ensure you have set a separate VNC password in system preferences, and unstick any \"enforce protocol 3.3\" options on your client.\nChanged to the server side component that allow you to log in with an entirely different session and use a virtual display rather than simply control or view the current display mean that most if not all VNC clients require updates to be fully compatible with the new features in Lion.\n", "Q: Is there a way to replace Finder altogether? It seems that a rather large group of Mac users considers Finder to be a product that contains a number of conceptual failures and oversimplifications.\nIt is however not clear whether Finder can be completely replaced with other application.\nIs it possible to remove it from the OS, including thing like file open dialogs etc?\n\nA: There's an Apple-documented general overview of the technologies that specifically support kiosk on OS X — \nTechnical Note TN2062: Creating Kiosks\n— with a section Replacing the Finder. \n\n… Is it possible to remove it from the OS, \n\nI recommend not attempting to remove Finder. \n\nincluding thing like file open dialogs etc? …\n\nOf possible interest, in Apple Support Communities: \n\n\n*\n\n*preferring to not show the sidebar in expanded save dialogues\n\nA: It is quite easy to remove finder. Just disable the launchd job (making sure to start your replacement or know how to ssh into the mac to launch finder by hand / enable the launchd job)\nYou will break your mac software if you don't know what you are doing.\nIt's really as simple as throwing the following two lines inside the <dict>  </dict> part of  /System/Library/Launch\\ Agents/com.apple.finder.plist\n<key>Disabled</key>\n<true/>\n\nThe OS supplies many API - so the file open dialog really isn't finder but a lower level construct. Finder calls those API like any other program, it's just that Finder is expected by the designers to be running all the time.\nIf you are looking to rip out all API that finder calls or that call finder, the job would be Herculean (Sisyphean if you fail to pull it off).\nMost people unhappy with finder run something like PathFinder.\n", "Q: Print PDF with crop marks I have an A4 PDF document that has content all the way to the border and I want to print it out.\nHence I print out on A3 sized paper (i.e. I print on paper twice the size) and then cut it to the actual size.\nIs there an easy way to add crop marks to the document when printing it?\n\nA: If it’s a simple PDF document, you could possibly open it with Inkscape and then add crop marks with Extensions > Render > Printing Marks…. Or maybe Scribus, with Print… > Marks. \nVery hacky but might help somebody in a tight corner.\n\nA: If you have Adobe Acrobat Pro, this is easily done: File > Print > Advanced > Marks and Bleeds > Trim Marks\nThis may also be possible under Acrobat Reader, if someone would care to test it.\n\nA: I have not found any way to do it on the free version. I was hoping there was, so that Sales would not have to come back to Prepress all the time to have us print out a proof with marks, but I'm not finding any way for them to do it in the free version (i.e. Acrobat Reader).\n\nA: Realistically, printed matter that extends to the paper's edge needs to go further than that! This is what is known as 'bleed'.\nThe page is normally printed on a larger sheet, with crop marks, and the colour objects extend over the cropped area, so that the trim line is within the inked area.\nIf the edge of an inked area is on the trim line, this invariably leaves a little white line where the blade and the ink don't quite meet. Cutting through the inked area guarantees no white lines.\nTo create a page with crop marks and bleed, of course, you need to go back to the original artwork in a competent application.\n", "Q: Can I cause auto-correct in Lion to beep and to get a summary of the changes? Auto-correct in Lion is great, but I need to know when it has made a substitution so I can check it. \nIs there a way to set an audio alert so that OS X makes a sound to alert me everytime it autocorrects?\nIs there another way to see a quick summary of the auto-correct changes which have occurred in a document?\n\nA: As a Mac developer I've been working on a solution to this problem, so far I've been able to detect autocorrect in a NSTextView within the app itself and play a sound to alert the user. \nAt the moment I am working on making it able to detect autocorrect in any NSTextView in any app but that's a bit harder and may take longer so I thought I would just brief you on what I've done so far.\nI'll edit this answer with the final app when it can detect autocorrection in any app.\nHere's what I've got done so far: [Most up to date download link further down]\n\nI'm currently in the process of testing a version of the app which is generalised and works on every single text view no matter which app is active. It uses a slightly different method to how I did it when it was just a NSTextView within the app itself as when you deal with these things with other apps (via the Accesability API) you don't have direct access to the objects themselves.\nAnyway enough with the 'jibber-jabber', here are some screen shots of the preferences:\n\nGeneral - At the moment it just lets you choose the sound to play when autocomplete is detected.\n\nBlacklist - Allows you to blacklist certain apps so that autocorrect detection is turned off and no sound is played.\nThe reason I am testing it is because the method I use is not completely sound, it simply detects any change in text before the cursor. This means it will detect autocomplete but in general will detect any change in text that is NOT directly done by the user (e.g a button which clears all text) other than this it works pretty well. \nI'll update this answer with a download link once I've finished testing.\n\n\nI've finished testing, so… here's the download link: http://cl.ly/9CIZ\nIt runs in the background, so has no dock icon. To access the preferences double click on the app in Finder.\nAgain, this doesn't work perfectly and has a couple of bugs but it should work 99% of the time!\n\nA: I can't seem to find any such feature.\nBest I can think of is to either write the hack yourself, or to look into a third-party solution.\nAs for third-party apps, I think TextExpander allows for audio alerts. I'm sure there are other apps though.\n", "Q: Mac Book Pro crashing I have a Mac Book Pro (late 2008, unibody design).

Looking through the Apple Support Communities suggests that if Apple has implemented it, they’ve hidden it very well!\nThe only workaround I found, aside the one you mentioned above about forwarding it to yourself, is to set the default mail client as “Mail” in Preferences, then when you send it out, you could use Mail.app’s BCC function. Of course, this isn’t really a workaround, as you lose the iPhoto templates.\n\nA: The nice thing about sending directly from iPhoto (via Share → Email) is the layout facilities available, ideal for Christmas greetings and similar. However, the downside to this is the unavailability of the BCC: address line. I personally fail to understand why Apple did not design that in.\nThe workaround for this that I found is to set up whatever you would like to send out via iPhoto → Mail, and take a screenshot of this (⌘⇧4) which can be added into a regular email. This way we have both: the enhanced layout facility and the BCC: line.\n", "Q: How to check what is starting Finder? I have Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard, and installed the Path Finder file manager for replacing the builtin Finder.\nBecause of that, I have Path Finder setup so that the original Finder is quit during startup. However, during system use sometimes Finder would seem to spontaneously start. Is there a way to check what I did to trip it, or what application, is making Finder start?\nThanks.\n\nA: The answer may be in the code of some applications.\n\nWhat applications support Path Finder?\nThe vast majority of applications support Path Finder with absolutely no compatibility >problems, but some applications go one step further and had special integration built >in.\nA small list of examples include:\nA-Dock\nQuicksilver\nButler\nName Mangler\nDragThing\nDefault Folder X\nLaunchBar\nChange Desktop\nSome applications do require Apple's Finder to work properly as they are hard-wired >this way. If you would like to see compatibility added for one of your favorite apps, >visit our forum and let us know!\n\nTheir forum is located at http://www.cocoatech.com/forum/. See if you can find any applications that you use that are listed there that have issues. Finder is such an integral part of the operating system that replacing it requires applications not to call Finder or for Path Finder to intercept those calls I assume.\n", "Q: Do encrypted Time Machine backups work across a network? I see that Lion offers the option of encrypting TIme Machine backup volumes, which seems like a Good Thing.  After reading up a bit on this, it seems clear that it will handle the situation where the backup volume is physically attached to the machine being backed up.  However, I've gotten mixed signals about whether this will work with networked clients.  I have a server with a TM volume, and a number of machines on my network use that server and its disk for TM backups.  Can I encrypt the TM volume in this situation, and will Time Machine be able to back up from those clients to the server?  I can't think of any reason why it shouldn't work, but, like I said, the overall story isn't completely clear.  Thanks for any advice!\n\nA: According to information from this page, the answer is no, it will not support encrypted Time Machine backups to network-attached storage. They're specifically mentioning Time Capsules and Airport Extremes. The issue Paul Eccles mentioned looks to be related to whether you can backup to NAS with Time Machine at all without regard to encryption status.\nThe link referenced also seems to indicate you can't use Time Machine encryption on direct-attached storage, but that may be because you can use Disk Utility to encrypted a direct-attached volume instead. Commenter Fracai calls out the classic standby of creating an encrypted disk image, storing that on network-attached storage, and mounting that for your Time Machine backups.\nI'll also point out the discussion on that page (which is slightly inaccurate, but mostly on) wherein commenter TrumpetPower! cautions encrypting backups. This is a point worth repeating here. I'll rephrase (more precisely and accurately) what TrumpetPower! wrote:\n\n\n*\n\n*The purpose of a backup is to preserve availability of data.\n\n*The purpose of encryption is to prevent availability of data without the key used to encrypt the data.\n\n\nIf you encrypt a backup, you add complexity to a process designed to simplify and preserve access to your information. With complexity comes increased probability of failure. Thus, the chance that you lose access to your backed-up data goes up. Do yourself a favor and make sure you understand when and why you might wish to encrypt your backups and think hard about how you'll ensure you have access to your encryption key when it counts.\n", "Q: Can I charge an iPhone with another device's USB charger? I have a USB car charger from TomTom. Can I use it to charge my iPhone 4, or will that damage my phone?\n\nA: Yes, it works great. The iPhone charges over USB like many other devices. The iPhone can accept more current than the USB specification, so you might have a slower charge than a charger that provides that extra wattage, but the iPhone circuitry is designed to take any normal USB charge and properly handle the charge which includes pausing it when the battery is full.\n\nA: Also, just so you know, because I was curious about this myself, it is safe to charge the iPhone/iPod with the larger 10W iPad AC wall charger. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4327\n\nA: You can charge an iPhone with most any device which has a USB port. USB is designed such that it starts with a small amount of electricity and the device requests more if it wants it – like to charge, for example. I have never heard of a device being damaged by USB power and I sincerely doubt it's possible without some kind of hardware fault to begin with.\nIn fact, the problem most people find (especially with the iPad) is that the USB port can't provide enough power. This is the cause of the \"Not Charging\" notification which you get on iPads. I suppose that as the iPhone develops in power (with rumours of the A5 iPad chip coming to the iPhone 5 in September) this may become the case more generally.\nAs far as iPhones not getting enough juice, it's generally fine. Especially with the 12V cigarette lighter socket to which you are probably referring. The one exception I have found is the USB ports on in car stereos which are designed for memory sticks only (in order to play MP3s loaded on the sticks). Those just aren't built to supply enough power, and won't charge an iPhone (in my experience).\n", "Q: Why is my Magic TrackPad losing functionality after Fast User Switching several times? Basically, after using Fast User Switching to go back and forth between my wife's login and my own, we begin to experience loss of capactive touch functions on the Magic TrackPad. This occurred on both Snow Leopard and now Lion. A little more detail is in my post here: https://discussions.apple.com/message/15712385#15712385\n\nA: Okay, may have found something, posted to my other thread on this topic: https://discussions.apple.com/message/15963083#15963083\nOkay, some potentially good news:\nUnder System Preferences > Bluetooth > Advanced > option to Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer\nThis is turned on by default and is apparently a per-user setting, not a global setting, which is where the conflict begins, from what I can tell.\nMy guess is that, when turned on for all users, like it is by default, when the computer goes to sleep, the bluetooth signal gets screwy, probably stepping over itself, to listen for incoming requests for both users for both keyboard and trackpad. And/or, when a user wakes the computer by pressing one of these devices, the signal tries to relaunch the Bluetooth stack for both users for both devices immediately, again probably stepping over itself, setting up a chain of events that will cause Bluetooth connectivity to fail altogether after a few sleep/wake and/or Fast User Switching cycles.\nSo, for a couple days now I've been running with this option turned off for one user and on for the other user. So, depending on which user is currently logged into the console, you may have to wake the computer by way of the power button or the keyboard/trackpad. The good news, though, is that it would typically foul up after no more than a day, and it's gone a couple of days thus far without issue.\n", "Q: What format for my external drive allows use with Mac and Windows? How can I use my external hard drive on Mac OS so I can modify/edit files on both OS's: Mac and Windows? How should I format it?\n\nA: My answer from a similar question: Best File System for Sharing Between OS X and Windows\n\nIf you're working exclusively with 10.6.6 or greater on the Mac side, try exFAT. Native read/write support under Windows and OS X, and none of the file size limits of FAT32. Disk Utility will happily format your drives using it.\nIt's probably your best option, as it avoids any user-space filesystem drivers, which personally make me a bit uneasy.\nXP and Vista support exFAT with appropriate updates: Vista as of SP1, and XP with SP2 and the KB955704 update\nAlso a good point from the above posters re: MBR vs. GPT on 32bit systems.\n\nA: An MBR partition scheme with a FAT32 (called MS-DOS (FAT) in Disk Utility) volume will allow both OS X (10.4 and up) and Windows (XP and up) to read and write with no additional drivers. \n\nA: If you are dealing exclusively with Windows XP and later (XP and 2003 after an update) and OS X 10.6.5 both systems will be able to read and write exFAT file systems. This will require no additional software to work and will deal with large file and storage sizes much better than FAT32.\n\nA: FAT32 (called MS-DOS (FAT) by Disk Utility; a filesystem originally released in 1977 and updated a few times since, lastly in 1996) really is the only cross platform filesystem that is going to work fully out of the box with Windows and Mac OS X.\nBe careful though, if you are using Disk Utility to format the drive, you should make sure to choose the Master Boot Record partitioning scheme (hit the \"Options...\" button below the \"Partition Layout\" control on the Partition pane). The default GUID partitioning scheme won't be recognised by 32-bit Windows XP and earlier Windows operating systems and Mac OS X versions earlier than 10.4.\nMac OS X has had support for reading NTFS formatted disk for a few versions, but still doesn't have write support. There are a few third-party products that allow Mac OS X to read NTFS formatted drives but as far as I'm aware the free ones aren't as well maintained as the commercial ones. I'd love for someone to tell me differently. For a while I've been using http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/ but as far as I can tell it hasn't been updated since December 2008.\nTuxera (who develop one of the commercial NTFS drivers for Mac OS X) have a list of free NTFS drivers that are developed from the same NTFS-3G source used by Linux to read NTFS drives. http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-download/\n\nA: NTFS is a better filesystem than fat32 and is well supported by many OSes. OSX has several approach accessing NTFS read-write.\nThe open-source solution is to install ntfs-3g with macports, and modify your system's auto-mount script.\nthe disk can be formatted with windows, or with ntfsprogs on a mac.\n(filesystem operations always envolve risk, and very likely lots of command-line work.)\nNTFS is the native windows filesystem. It's open-source drivers work quite stably and reliably. NTFS will work like a charm if you'll ever need linux support.\nif you don't feel comfortable altering the system yourself, paid softwares and services can always be found.\ni can post my ntfs auto-mount script for mac if you can't find one with google.\n\nA: Using exFAT would be a good idea if the Windows computer runs Vista or Windows 7. This is a “simple“ filesystem yet it supports > 4 Gb files and multi-terabyte partitions.\nFor compatibility with 32 bits filesystems you still have to use MBR, not GPT.\n\nA: FAT32 (called MS-DOS (FAT) in Disk Utility) is a cross compatible file format although you will be limited to 4GB maximum per single file. Plugins for the mac can also allow it to handle using NTFS volumes, which is a more desirable solution\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the Finder sidebar icons I know you can change the icons of files, folders, etc, but in the sidebar folders appear the same. Is it possible to give them a custom icon for the sidebar like the Music, Photo's, Movies, etc folders have?\n\nA: CandyBar should do the trick for you.\n\nA: If you want to use the default Mavericks OS X Finder Icons, go to System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle (right-click > Show Package contents)/Contents/Resources.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Get Info on the folder in finder sidebar. \n\n*Drag the .icns file (e.g. ToolbarDownloadsFolderIcons.icns on to the small icon in Get Info window to the left of Downloads.\n\n\n\n\nA: If you are on El Capitan I think you have to disable SIP first:\n1.Restart your Mac.\n2.Before OS X starts up, hold down Command-R and keep it held down until you see an Apple icon and a progress bar.

I got a new MBP with Lion installed (as detailed here: How can I install an SSD on my new Lion MBP w/out install disks?), and I want to clone the drive (including the Lion install partition) to my new SSD drive? (Note: I don't care about the OS or user files since this is a brand new machine).\nEdit I have a solution, so mainly just created this question to share my result. However, I know others may have different ways to have done this, so please share\n\nA: It didn't take long - there is now an official assistant to roll your own external recovery HD. You need a USB drive with 1Gb of space and a free download.\nThe Lion Recovery Disk Assistant and OS X Lion: About Lion Recovery Disk Assistant will walk you through making an external bootable Recovery HD.\nAs the cloning software I like won't handle the Recovery HD yet, I've gotten good results by installing Lion onto the smaller hard drive and letting it make the Recovery HD.\nIt's easy to migrate the apps and data in post install rather than do it all in one step.\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner and no, there is no point in a DVD. Save the installer if you must. Redownload it from the store if you didn't save it, but most users never use the DVD and with recovery partition there no need for having a DVD lying around.\nBeside, are you aware how long mother nature need to decompose a DVD. Add some ecological thinking.\nWith no sarcasm: Thank you Apple for dropping the pointless DVD. \n\nA: Starting with version 3.4.4 Beta 1 it is possible to clone the Recovery Partition with Carbon Copy Cloner, check\nhttp://help.bombich.com/kb/troubleshooting/will-ccc-clone-the-recovery-hd-partition-on-lion\nfor more information.\n\nA: 1) Prepare an external disk with a complete fresh Lion install, including the hidden Recovery HD.\n2) Use SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to clone only your regular Lion Macintosh HD, full of your data, onto the regular Lion Macintosh HD on the external disk. It's a differential backup--it copies what's different between the two.\nYou will then have a volume on your main computer with your Lion partition and the Recovery HD on it, and you will have an external volume with your Lion partition and a Recovery HD on it.\n\nA: If others searching for this question just want to install a fresh copy of OS X on a new drive (like the OP) and your Mac has firmware support for Internet Recovery mode, you don't have to clone the old drive. You can:\n\n*\n\n*Replace the old drive with the new drive.\n\n*Start up and choose a network. The Mac will then display a spinning globe icon and download a disk image for the recovery system from Apple's servers.\n\n*After the Mac has started up from the recovery system, choose Install Mac OS X. It will download and install OS X, or the latest minor version of the major version of OS X your Mac came with.\n\nSee the OS X Internet Recovery section in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718:\n\nIf you happen to encounter a situation in which you cannot start from the Recovery System, such as your hard drive stopped responding or you installed a new hard drive without OS X installed, new Mac models introduced after public availability of OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion, automatically use the OS X Internet Recovery feature if the Recovery System (Command-R method above) doesn't work. OS X Internet Recovery lets you start your Mac directly from Apple's Servers. The system runs a quick test of your memory and hard drive to ensure there are no hardware issues.\nOS X Internet Recovery presents a limited interface at first, with only the ability to select your preferred Wi-Fi network and, if needed, enter the WPA passphrase. Next, OS X Internet Recovery will download and start from a Recovery System image. From there, you are offered all the same utilities and functions described above.\nAs with the Recovery System, reinstallation of OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion from OS X Internet Recovery requires an Internet connection. See \"Supported network configurations and protocols\" below.\nSome computers that did not ship with OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion installed may have a software update available that allows them to use Lion Internet Recovery.\n\n\nA: First, I put both the new and old drive into a PC of mine, and loaded up an Ubuntu LiveCD.  At this point, my old drive is showing up as /dev/sde and new drive is /dev/sdf (WARNING: be sure to update the below commands with your device assignments or you can easily ERASE all your data).  fdisk doesn't work on the drive because it is a GPT partition table(?), and so I use gdisk instead.\nI forgot to mention in my question, the drives are of different sizes (500gb was old, 128gb is new), so I couldn't just clone the entire drive.  Instead, I recreated the partitions with gdisk and copied the MBR over.\nI most likely went about creating the MBR (master boot record) on the new drive completely wrong, but this way worked for me: \n\n\n*\n\n*dd if=/dev/sde of=/dev/sdf count=39 bs=512 (the reason was the first 39 sectors were not part of a partition)\n\n*Next, I opened gdisk /dev/sdf with which there was a problem: the MBR I copied over brought the old drive's partition table & its sector information (i.e. new drive thought it was 500gb).  So I used the \"repair\" option in gdisk as it recommended, deleted partitions #2 & #3, and saved the table.\n\n*At this point, if I went back into gdisk, the disk showed a MBR, and no longer had errors.\n\n\nNext, I created the other two partitions, being extra careful to setup the sector size exactly as the old disk had (for the #1 EFI partition and the #3 Recovery HD partition that is). For #2, I just did the math, and created the disk accordingly).\nFinally, I used dd to copy partition #1 (\"EFI System Partition\") and #3 (\"Recovery HD\") over from the old drive:\ndd if=/dev/sde1 of=/dev/sdf1\ndd if=/dev/sde3 of=/dev/sdf3\n\nWhen I put the new drive in my MBP, I held Command+R to get into the Mac OS X Utilities, at which point I erased my main partition (at first, the disk wasn't listed when I went to install Lion -- probably since I just created the partition and didn't format it).  I formatted it to the recommended file system (Journaled  -- I forget how they phrased it).\nOS X Lion is currently installing, and seems to be okay.  I'll post back if I get any oddness.\nNote: gdisk mentioned in its help section that it is probably best to use a Mac disk utility if the GPT drive is being use on a mac, so take my solution with a grain of salt.  (I think fdisk says the same warning about NTFS and FAT, but I've never had a problem with using fdisk/linux to create/format/etc on that end).\n\nA: I would just recommend SuperDuper! The free trial lets you do just that, and it makes it bootable for you. Really great software.\n", "Q: What redundant, on-site, low-downtime backup strategies exist for servers? I'm helping manage a OSX snow leopard server for a small company and one of the first things we did was setup time machine to get backups going.  However, having at least one more of the copy of the data seems prudent. It's starting to keep me up at night.\nThe thing we like about time machine is that it's so hands free and doesn't interfere.  I realize that we could shut down the server every week and do a full clone of the drive but I'm hoping for something much simpler and without any downtime. \nCan anyone recommend simple to manage and cost effective strategies for redundant backups of OSX systems? In our case since we are really bandwidth constrained (low throughput + high cost), online backup isn't a practical solution.  Was hoping for a solution to automatically get the data to another drive located somewhere else within the building.\n\nA: CrashPlan and TimeMachine have been very helpful for almost all the situations I've seen where one copy isn't enough.\nCrash Plan software is very good - watch your java CPU usage until you're comfortable things are running smoothly in incremental mode, but it's as good as any of the other software that's out these days. The software will run on both the sending and the receiving computer elsewhere on your campus/building.\nYou can of course back up to your offsite storage but once you've got it to the other computer, tapes, off site drive cloning and other non-bandwidth consuming options can work well.\nJust watch Java CPU usage when you have large file changes - you can throttle things if needed, but it's pretty self-sufficient with the out of the box settings.\n", "Q: VPN on demand - does it ever work? We are running Snow Leopard Server and have setup VPN here and external users can pretty easily connect to it.  We want to make it even easier though.  The one option that I've spent several hours trying to get to work is \"VPN on demand\", which you of course can find in the 'Advanced' pane of the VPN network options.\nWe recently tried it again after one client was updated to Lion but got the same result. That is, if one tries to navigate to an address that resolves to our server, it does not automatically connect to the VPN.\nHas anyone managed to get this to work? Is there a trick to it? I've seen several threads on other sites with the same problem but no answers.\n\nA: For me, vpn-on-demand works if the following conditions are met:\n\n\n*\n\n*use a named configuration for the VPN interface (not default)\n\n*the triggering domain must be a hostname that can NOT be resolved using public DNS\n\n*vpn connection is only triggered by Safari (and maybe Mail), but not e.g. afp, vnc, smb connections let alone cli triggered connections like ssh\n\n\nA: As I've read many topic about VPN on Demand seems like not work.\nthen i was using route to manual routing for VPN Tunnel as interface name ppp0\nbelow is example for manual route to Pandora IP Address\nsudo route add -net 208.85.40.0/24 -interface ppp0\n\n", "Q: What are \"nwnode:\" URLs, and why did Lion break them? After installing OS X 10.7, Dropbox presented the following error upon loading: \"URLs with the type \"nwnode:\" are not supported\". I also got this error from Path Finder (although I don't know what I did to cause it).\nBoth applications only gave me the error once and have not done it since.\nWhat are nwnode: URLs? What purpose did they serve? And why did Lion stop supporting them?\n\n\nA: The error occurs when an application using Python symbol mappings in Mac OS X is not able to connect to a (previously) networked drive, Time Machine, Bonjour, shared or remote drives, etc. (nwnode). It's a depreciated method, which mostly is why Lion displays the error. Even if you don't use Time Machine, this error can occur, either from an os upgrade or app that uses Python (Dropbox in this case).\nUsually the issues can be resolved by following these steps (via Apple): \nResolution\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder, double-click on your hard disk.\n\n*Open the folder named System.\n\n*Open the Library folder.\n\n*Open the Filesystems folder.\n\n*Drag the folder named \"URLMount (from old Mac)\" to your desktop as a precautionary backup.\n\n*Once the copy is complete, control-click the original \"URLMount (from old Mac)\" folder (not the one on your desktop) and choose \"Move\nto Trash\" from the contextual menu.\n\n*Enter the name and password of an administrator if prompted. The first user account created on your Mac is an administrator account.\n\n*Restart.\n\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS1736\n*note: The question above was posted six months ago, although I decided to answer it today simply because nobody seemed to know the answer. Hopefully someone who reads this will understand what the error means now.\nAnd just for Bryson, here is just one of it's strings in symbol_mappings.py:\n'__ZN17SharePointBrowser18setConnectionStateE21NWNodeConnectionState' :\n 'SharePointBrowser.o',\n\n\nA: The Dropbox forum has a topic on this with a suggestion to install the latest build of Dropbox.  I can't speak directly to that other than to say that my Dropbox install was up to date on Snow Leopard when I upgraded to Lion last week and it continued to work. I'd certainly agree with the suggestion of getting on the latest Dropbox as a first step.\n", "Q: MacBook multi-touch trackpad support Why is 3-4 finger multitouch support not available (not even listed as trackpad preference options) on my late 2008 white plastic Mac book?\n\nA: The trackpad in the 2008 white plastic MacBook isn't capable of supporting multitouch gestures. As it's a hardware limitation -- meaning the trackpad hardware can't sense input from 3-4 separate fingers at once -- there aren't any hacks to get around the limitation.\nOne way to get full multitouch support would be to get a Magic Trackpad. They'll work with any bluetooth-enabled Mac running Mac OS X Snow Leopard v10.6.4 or later.\n", "Q: How can I have an iTunes DJ-style playback on my iOS Device? I use iTunes DJ pretty frequently, it serves a great purpose for when you have no specific artist/album you wish to listen to, nor a loose collection of songs based around a single genre (Genius).\nThis issue is at it's worst when I'm driving, and wish to listen to music; Voice Command only gives me the ability to pick an artist, album, or playlist. \nHow best am I able to create something which uses my entire Music library, and can quickly, easy, and perhaps most important of all, safely, begin playing any random item?\nAdditionally, shuffle should be turned on, or some other aspect of randomization should be used as part of the accepted solution. One other important aspect is that I've explicitly mentioned the use of Voice Command, which only exists on an iPhone (3GS and 4).\n\nA: I use an app called InstanTunes.\nIt doesn't have voice command, but it does use a selected Source playlist to generate a random playlist from. Then uses this playlist as a Queue. Whenever you like you can add songs to the playlist which are added into the Next Song position of the playlist.\n", "Q: Is it possible to switch between spaces with Command+Number in Lion? In Snow Leopard I could switch spaces by pressing ⌘+Number. Is there a way to turn that on in Lion?\n\nA: Yes you can.

You will find Mission Control section for shortcut, and there is entry called Switch to Desktop.\nYou could define your own shortcut here.\n", "Q: Why are my plists in ~/Library/Preferences accompanied by a matching lockfile in Lion? $ cd ~/Library/Preferences\n$ ls -1 | grep plist | head -10\nAddressBookMe.plist\ncom.adiumX.adiumX.plist\ncom.adiumX.adiumX.plist.lockfile\ncom.apple.AddressBook.plist\ncom.apple.AddressBook.plist.lockfile\ncom.apple.BezelServices.plist\ncom.apple.BezelServices.plist.lockfile\ncom.apple.BluetoothAudio.plist\ncom.apple.Console.LSSharedFileList.plist\ncom.apple.Console.LSSharedFileList.plist.lockfile\n\nwhat are these lockfiles for?\n\nA: Apple supplies a Core Foundation Preference Services API to developers that makes it easy for them to manage preferences. Apple uses the same API and these lock files help the system know what programs are writing to the files and it helps the system notify the running program when a setting gets changed.\nThe system will keep track of a file that's open even if you trash and delete it, but it's probably best to leave these alone (like most of ~/Library) as there's no undo for things that are stored there - they are there to support the \"undo\" of the rest of the system.\n\nA: Lockfiles are used to make sure only one app interacts with a preference file at once. The idea is an app opens the lockfile in an exclusive mode while it opens the plist.\nSource:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lockfiles and other plist file subtypes in OS X Lion\n\nA: Purely guesswork unfortunately, but typically lockfiles are there to stop a file being edited by more than one thing at a time and causing corruption.\nHowever if you run fs_usage on your Mac to watch filesystem activity nothing much seems to touch these files. The Finder seems to read through them all occasionally but that seems to be it, even if you change preference settings in various applications.\n\nA: Have you noticed if you can make settings changes to applications?  I'm seeing these lockfiles also and preferences are not being saved to the plist files.\nUPDATE: I discovered that a previous ACL was in place that prevented me from making changes to application settings.  By removing the ACLs using chmod -R -N on my home folder I am now able to make changes that are saved.\nKent\n", "Q: Mission Control slow and jerky on 2011 MacBook Pros: any fix? Mission Control has been horribly slow on my 2011 MacBook Pro 15\" (2GHz quad i7, 8GB RAM, 256MB graphics, SSD) -- swiping up usually freezes the screen for 2 seconds, before showing me the Mission Control layout. I've tried switching to discrete graphics only, but the problem doesn't go away.\nIt seems others have been experiencing this, too, and it might be a video driver issue. Has anyone found a fix for this? One MacRumors forum post suggested disabling automatic scrollbar overlays, but that hasn't helped. \n\nA: Only a couple of suggestions, and neither is sure to work, but worth a try.\nSafe boot - Start up in Safe mode with the Shift key held until the progress bar appears.  Select Restart (normally) at the login in window.  Safe boot mode does a Repair Disk during boot.\nRe-install the OS - Your data and settings will be preserved.

Normally, Mac OS X lets you choose to show the login screen as a list of users (you click to enter the password), or two text fields (you enter the username and password):\n\nBut, I use FileVault 2. So, when I first turn on the computer I'm greeted with the login screen (with a blue background).\nThis is fine, except for one thing: It's a list of users.\nBut, for a variety of reasons, I prefer the 'Name and password' style.\nIs it possible to have FileVault give a prompt for username and password, instead of a list of users?\n\nA: I'm quoting this directly from a post in this thread at Apple Discussions:\n\nThis isn't a bug. This is the way FileVault-2's EFI boot authentication UI is built. When your Mac first starts up, EFI-boot takes over to decide what to do. It either continues to bring up the system to the typical OSX login screen, which is managed by OSX's system preferences, or it starts a special EFI pre-boot where it displays the FV2 unlock screen with the icons of designated OSX accounts approved to unlock the disk. Once you log on, the EFI unlock sequence carries forth your credentials, performing a single signon.\nI have submitted a UI request (not as a bug) to be able to either edit the EFI boot screen (look at /usr/standalone/i386/EfiLoginUI directory, none are editable using normal applications) or ask that a feature is included, probably in the FV system preference pane, to add a custom banner.\n\nFor now, there doesn't appear to be a way to change it.\n", "Q: How do I disable Safari-only mode? I have no desire to enable Lion's Safari-only mode.

Like many of you, I'm sure, Mission Control isn't quite cutting it for me in Lion. I much preferred Spaces and Exposé. So, naturally, I tried reinstalling them on Lion. I got Spaces.app, Expose.app, and Expose&Spaces.prefpane from a machine running Snow Leopard, and tried installing them in System Prefs and the Applications folder. \nIt didn't work. Every time you open up the Spaces and Exposé prefpane, it shows the Mission Control pane. Double-clicking on Spaces.app brought up Mission Control, even if you change the name.\nAny idea on how to install Spaces and Exposé on Lion?\n\nA: This is impossible because Mission Control / Spaces / Exposé are actually controlled by the Dock. And you'll certainly have no end of trouble if you try to transplant the Dock between OS versions.\n\nA: You can't, it's Mission Control all the way. I'm actually quite happy with it, and made a pretty seamless transition. What features are you missing? You can do everything with Mission Control that you could do with Spaces and Exposé, with the sole exception of Spaces in rows.

I maintain more than 20 million files in my trash without cleaning.\nCan it slow down my Mac OS X?\n\nA: I was thinking about whether or not the Trash is just like any other folder from a file system's point of view. Let's assume that it is for a second, then another way to look at this would be \"what's the worse that can happen to the performance of my Mac if I keep thousands of files in any folder? Mac OS X probably does some sort of memory swapping using the hard drive, so that would be the first problem of an increase in used hard drive space. But this may be the case of any folder, not only the Trash. \nThat reminded me of my Windows days and how running utilities to defragment a hard drive made my system feel faster after frequent defragmentation. However, unlike Windows, Apple claims that due to its design, their OS does not need defragmenting. Take a look at this interesting article. On it, Apple claims that it can handle thousands of files. However, Apple here is talking only about the file system itself. \nJohn Siracusa, on his Ars Technica review of Lion mentions that performance does in fact decrease with thousands of files. However, the way I read his article is that the performance decrease is on the Finder UI itself rather than on the file system as a whole (i.e., the Finder is not the file system). It makes sense that if there is more information to prepare graphically and your computer was running multiple apps to the point of your system being very taxed for RAM; then the Finder will probably have a harder time rendering a simple Finder window to show thousands of files in the Trash. \nComing back to your original question, it seems to me that a user who never empties the Trash and only accesses its contents occasionally would not seen any noticeable performance decrease on the rest of his system--other than perhaps the Finder struggling to render the contents of the Trash every now and then. I would consider any performance hits on the system the same as with any other growing folder. Hope this helps. \n\nA: No, unless you're using up so much space on your hard drive that the system doesn't have any room left for VM swap space.\n\nA: I once deleted some video files (i.e large files) after emptying the trash the amount of inactive memory decreased & the amount of free memory increased. It was a slight difference but apparently it does the trash does affect your system.\n\nA: You could take the \"wooden stick\" approach to weather reporting.\nIf the stick is wet, it's raining.\nDo you see huge bursts of IO in Activity monitor related to trash icon browsing or drawing? \nYour mac is storing hundreds of thousands of files in a modern file system. Unless some app has poor IO skills and is looking in that folder, you shouldn't notice a thing.\nFinder is the only app that routinely checks on the various trash directories. As long as it's not using too much RAM for your comfort or using too much CPU - you've got your answer.\n", "Q: \"Contextual Menu Items\" folder missing on my Mac.

I have to admit I'm a bit mystified in trying to understand one particular part of the OS X user interface: interacting with content in \"inactive\" windows.\nFor example, let's say we have Chrome & Safari each taking up 50% of the viewable screen estate. We're \"in\" Chrome and want to click a link in Safari - why the need to click twice? (once to activate Safari, again to interact with the link)\nIn other operating systems, clicking anything that's viewable will generally \"just work\". I can understand Mac OS shielding a user from having to account for their every errant click, but it seems that OS X's \"interface\" elements only require one click (hitting \"play\" in iTunes, closing a tab in Firefox, etc.), which are ironically the actions that carry the most dramatic consequences if clicked accidentally.\nIs there some method to this madness or am I forever to have to click and anxiously wait to see if I need to click again?\n\nA: Sit, my children, and let me tell you of the world and its tricks...\nScrolling\nYou can basically always scroll inactive window content. I can't even think of a case where this isn't true. (This also means that scroll-to-navigate works in Lion.)\nDragging\nIn many cases, you can drag content from inactive windows/apps without focusing the app. For example, you can drag a file from Finder or a message from Mail.\nClicking\nWhen you click a button that's on a window, it usually \"accepts first mouse events\" — meaning your mouse-down will both focus the window and act as a mouse-down event on the button. Then when you let go, the button will carry out its duty.\n(Also note: in the case of the close/minimize/zoom widgets,\n\nyou can actually click them without focusing the window.)\n(Second aside: in toolbars, it's not uncommon to disable some buttons while they're inactive, so you don't accidentally click them — take Mail's delete button, for instance. However, this functionality is slightly broken in Lion, because if you start clicking (so the window focuses) and then drag, you can actually still activate the button.)\nHowever, this mostly only works for buttons. As you've noticed, when you try to click a link (or select text, or another similar action), you have to focus the window first by clicking, and only then can you interact with the content.\nThe Great Workaround\n(or the rule of thumb, as you say; hehe)\nTo get to the point: In most cases, when you hold down ⌘ Command, you can interact with inactive window content. You can hold down ⌘ and select (and even drag) text in the background, drag things around (including scrollbars!), click buttons, and more, without activating the window.\n\"But wait!\" I hear you say. \"Holding down ⌘ opens links in a new tab!\" Ay, there's the rub:\nWhen you hold down ⌘ and click a link in Safari or Chrome, it will work without activating the window... but the link will open in a new tab.\nAnd to my knowledge there's no Great Workaround for that, unless you want to disable ⌘-clicking in your browser.\nThere you have the facts — make the workflow you will of them!\n\nAn update, quoting some content from Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (this is just for reference, not to prove a point):\n\nAvoid providing click-through for an item or action whose result might\nbe dangerous or undesirable. Specifically, avoid enabling\nclick-through for an item that:\n\n*\n\n*Performs a potentially harmful action that users can’t cancel (for\nexample, the Delete button in Mail)\n\n*Performs an action that is\ndifficult or impossible to cancel (such as the Send button in Mail)\n\n*Dismisses a dialog without telling the user what action was taken (for\nexample, the Save button in a Save dialog that overwrites an existing\nfile and automatically dismisses the dialog)\n\n*Removes the user from the\ncurrent context (for example, selecting a new item in a Finder column\nthat changes the target of the Finder window)\n\nClicking in any one of\nthese situations should cause the window that contains the item to be\nbrought forward, but no other action to be taken.\nIn general, it’s safe to provide click-through for an item that asks\nthe user for confirmation before executing, even if the command\nultimately results in destruction of data. For example, you can\nprovide click-through for a delete button if you also make sure to\ngive users the opportunity to cancel or confirm the action before it\nproceeds.\nThink twice before supporting click-through for items that don’t\nprovide confirmation feedback. Specifically, consider how dangerous\nthe action might be, and determine how difficult it will be for the\nuser to undo the action after it’s performed. For example, the Mail\nDelete button does not provide click-through because it deletes a\nmessage without asking for confirmation, which is a potentially\nharmful action that can be difficult to undo. On the other hand,\nclick-through for the New button in Mail is fine because its resulting\naction is not harmful and is easy to undo.\nEnsure that items that do not support click-through appear disabled\nwhen their window is inactive. The disabled appearance helps users\nunderstand that these controls are unavailable. For example, the\ndelete and mark as junk buttons in the inactive Mail window shown\nbelow do not support click-through.\n\n", "Q: Is there a GUI for OS X LaunchAgents?

Has anyone run 10.7 as a Server (for iCal and Adressbook) for 10.6-Clients? Did you encounter any Problems one should be aware of before upgrading?\nTIA\n\nA: Not everything is working smoothly.\nWe notice that 10.6.8 clients among them have issues with delegated calendars; if user A logs in to the CalDAV server and connects properly, the calendars are downloaded to the client and the own calendar plus the delegated calendars are shown.\nWhen user B creates an account and logs in, chances are that she can successfully connect to the server but by then user A sees his account changed to B and everything in his iCal calendar is wiped. Disabling (taking the calendar offline) the calendar and adding account A again adds the data back in.\nAt that moment user B sees a blanked calendar and her name changed to A. Disabling this A calendar and re-entering the account for B puts things straight. Sort of.\nThis has happened multiple times; two users had the problem among them, then another group of four users had the same problem. You just have to keep disabling and re-adding the desired account until all users see only the account they need.\nA peculiarity of delegation is that when adding delegates, only three, not more and not less, letters of a delegate should be typed to get a popup that you can actually choose (by pressing Enter). UNLESS the short user name consists of only three or four letters. In that case, the ENTER is rejected, you cannot choose the delegate and you HAVE to ADD a space and one more (fake?) letter. Then the three or four lettered username pops up which you then CAN select. Weird. Now the user is delegated.\nAnother issue we have is that changes made in a delegated calendar do not always trickle up to the server; consistently from some 10.6.8 clients, but not every client. Neither when you have 'push', nor when you have 'every x minutes'. Annoying.\n10.7 clients work flawlessly as far as we can see.\n\nA: Everything has been working fine for us; we've got a mixed environment for 10.6 and 10.7 clients now with 10.7 servers.  Nothing seems to be broken (on the client side).\n", "Q: Find which RAR file is bad I have a RAR I downloaded made up of multiple files.

You can fire up iTunes - that online store should paint in about the same time as the Mac App store if your app and account are working correctly.

This is most noticeable when switching to it after its been in the foreground.\nI don't get this problem with other Windows apps and am baffled because the machine has more than enough grunt to handle a few MDI'd windows yet grinds for up to five minutes sometimes when reactivating the VS environment - the screen update seems to slow everything down. My colleagues are using identical hardware and software but running Windows under Parallels on their Macs does not lead to this behaviour.\nI'm getting desperate (and I've asked this same question at StackOverflow.com) - does anyone know why this might be happening and whether there's a fix ...?\n\nA: I asked the same question at Stackoverflow and got an answer which appears to have fixed my issues. Hardware acceleration (paradoxically) is what was slowing down my VS.\nHTH somebody.\n", "Q: Possible to force a sync of Game Center Achievements already gained? For various reasons, I've only just updated to iOS4.\nThere are a number of games that I have gained achievements for, it is possible to update the game center app to recognise these achievements automatically?\n\nA: I am not aware of a way to force the updating other than running the apps to see if they will update things as a matter of course. Some app developers store the achievements in a way that they flow back from the game center - but it's more about how each developer chooses to use all the Game Center options.\nLook for a much better experience when iCloud allows developers to store more app data in the cloud so you don't have to export/import and otherwise work to get your settings and loot to a new instance of the same app.\nAn alternate tack is to dive into the library of each app using a tool like PhoneView. You don't need to jailbreak the device - but often can find the folder where achievements are stored and you can put them back when they go missing.\n", "Q: How long should Lion take to set up Spotlight? I updated my Mac from Snow Leopard 10.6.8 to Lion. Everything went well. The computer restarted when the OS setup finished. Now, Spotlight setup has been running for more than two hours. Is something wrong? In the meantime, I can't open the App Store or Software Update. \n\nA: First off - Spotlight works incrementally as you write any data to the drive. This processing has filters and pattern detectors that extract information from files and store those \"nuggets\" in a database structure that allows spotlight to find things.\nLion changed the filters, so your old database is now out of date. The entire hard drive has now to pass through the changed filters one time. The first pass could be done in about the same time as the install took if you have nothing on the mac.\nIt's hard to know what type of files you have - as spotlight will take a lot longer to index a 5 MB text file than it will a 5 MB music file. Using the mac will slow down the updating, so many people turn off spotlight after an upgrade and let it do the entire drive scan over night or when you are away from the Mac so it can just do that one task without slowing you down.\nI would say most macs that can run Lion should be done indexing in 12 hours unless there are problems. Those problems usually have messages in the console log (/var/log/system.log) - but it's probably just something you need to wait out.\n", "Q: Why my application icons wiggle when I press ALT key in Launchpad? I tried Launchpad first time today and went through the common modifier keys & their combinations to see if some hidden options appear.\nWhen I pressed ⌥ ALT all the apps started wiggling. What does it mean?\n\nA: Wiggle is the edit mode. (so you can delete or uninstall the apps that came from the app store) \nHolding alt is the quickest way to enter edit mode.\n\nA: If you click and hold them they also start wiggling. It lets you drag them around, to re-arrange them, and also delete apps from the Mac App Store.\n\nA: When they are wiggling you can rearrange them AND delete/remove apps that you yourself have downloaded. System apps (like iOS) cannot be deleted.\n", "Q: Why my osx lion can't setup soptlight? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow long should Lion take to set up Spotlight? \n\nMy mac osx from snow leopard 10.6.8 update to Lion,all os setup is all right,but it lookslike can't setpu soptlight ,it stand for the loading process for a long time.(more than 3 hours)\n\nA: Have you tried repairing the disk & its permissions?

Say that I have two computers connected to the same network.\nI know that from computer1 and file sharing enabled I can snoop around inside computer2.\nBut say that there is something interesting on computer2, which you access by typing localhost:9091 in safari. (e.g. transmission's web UI).\nTo access that I would have to type in the ip_address_of_computer2:9091 on computer1.\nBut how do I find out computer2's ip address without using computer2?\n\nA: Method #1\nThe easiest way would be to access your network router's administration page. It will have information about any other devices on the network, including IP address.\nMethod #2\nIf you know the computer's network name you can ping it in the Terminal. It will return the computer's IP address.\nMethod #3\nIf you don't know the computer's network name, there's another trick you can do using ping. Find your IP address and your subnet mask. Both should be visible in the Network preference pane of System Preferences. Line up your IP address and your subnet mask, and replace any 0 values in the subnet mask with 255 in the same relative position of the IP address. For example, if you have the following IP address and subnet mask, respectively:\n192.168.1.151\n255.255.255.0\nThe 0 is in the last field of the subnet mask, so you replace the last field of the IP address with 255 and ping it: ping 192.168.1.255\nYou should get a response with the IP address of any device on the network capable of responding to pings.\nMethod #4\nLast trick is to use the terminal command arp -a. This will show the IP and MAC address of all devices on the network that it knows about.\nLast two tricks courtesy of this Macworld article.\n\nA: Q: How do I know the IP addresses of other computers in my network?\nA lot of networks\nWell, first of all your computer is probably on a lot of networks. You can see this with the ifconfig command. There is a lot of info in there, but most of it is overwhelming, so I like to filter is like so:\n$ ifconfig | grep -E '^[a-z0-9]|inet '\n\nlo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 16384\n    inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000\ngif0: flags=8010<POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST> mtu 1280\nstf0: flags=0<> mtu 1280\nen0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    inet 192.168.0.101 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255\nen1: flags=963<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX> mtu 1500\nen2: flags=963<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX> mtu 1500\np2p0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 2304\nawdl0: flags=8943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1484\nbridge0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    inet 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255\nutun0: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 2000\nutun1: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    inet 172.141.0.10 --> 172.141.0.9 netmask 0xffffffff\nen5: flags=8963<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    inet 169.254.146.193 netmask 0xffff0000 broadcast 169.254.255.255\nbridge100: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    inet 192.168.3.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.3.255\n\nThe first field of the left aligned lines are network interface names. You wifi is probably en0. My TunnelBlick VPN to AWS is utun1. My System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing created bridge100 for the RaspberryPi I have getting internet from my MacBook Pro via my ethernet dongle.\nAssume IPv4\nBecause you asked for IP addresses I assume IPv4 addresses are what you care about. I used \"inet \" (with a space) to block the \"inet6\" entries for IPv6. If you wanted IPv6 you probably know more about networking than I do and I should be asking you questions.\nFind the hosts\nLet's focus on that bridge100 and bring you a little Google traffic. Lots of people run into this situation when they want to SSH or RDC into a headless computer (like a RaspberryPi) either on their network or tethered via Internet Sharing. It's especially difficult when you have no connection history (arp table) with the device. For this you can use sudo nmap -sn 192.168.3.0/24, which is the value of bridge100 inet (192.168.3.1) with the last digit replaced with \"0/24\". However, nmap isn't standard on OSX so we can install it with homebrew.\n$ brew install nmap\nWarning: nmap-7.31 already installed\n\n$ sudo nmap -sn 192.168.3.0/24\nPassword:\n\nStarting Nmap 7.31 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-11-21 22:03 EST\nNmap scan report for 192.168.3.6\nHost is up (0.00025s latency).\nNmap scan report for 192.168.3.1\nHost is up.\nNmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 2.08 seconds\n\nFrom that you can assume that my RaspberyPi got IP 192.168.3.6 for some reason. Last time I connected it I was on a different subnet and it got 192.168.2.3. That nmap trick is a lot better than typingping 192.168.3.2 ... ping 192.168.3.6 until you find it.\nI hope that helps.\n\nA: This script should give you what you are looking for really quickly and requires to have nmap installed.\nThe advantage is that if your host does not reply to ping probes, nmap would still find the host while other tools will not.\n#!/bin/bash\ni=\"en1\" # edit this to fit your Network interface\ncidr=$(while read y; do echo ${y%.*}\".0/$(m=0; while read -n 1 x && [ $x = f ]; do m=$[m+4]; done < <(ifconfig $i | awk '/mask/             {$4=substr($4,3); print $4}'); echo $m )\"; done < <(ifconfig $i | awk '/inet[ ]/{print $2}') | head -n 1 | sed s/addr://g | sed 's/\\/0//g')\nmyip=`ifconfig $i | grep \"inet \" | awk 'NR==1 {print $2}' | sed s/addr://g`\nset -x\nsudo nmap -n -T4 -PN -p9091 --exclude \"$myip\" \"$cidr\"\n\nStore this script as lookup.sh and call it (with switch to english) with\nLANG=c bash lookup.sh\n\n\nA: There are a few other tools that have not been mentioned yet for discovering IP address information, assuming you have the host name and you are using mDNS (aka Bonjour in Mac environments).  Unless you have configured things differently, your local network names are in the form host-name.local so in your initial example you would be looking for computer2.local\nThe first:\n    dscacheutil -q host -a name <host-name>.local\n\nFor example:\n    % dscacheutil -q host -a name computer2.local\n    name: computer2.local\n    ip_address: 10.0.1.6\n\nAnother useful tool is dig (try dig google.com for example), which with a few special parameters can be used to query the mDNS nodes of your local network.\n    % dig @224.0.0.251 -p 5353 <host-name>.local\n    % dig @224.0.0.251 -p 5353 -x <ip-address>\n\nTo get just the IP address out of dig you can try:\n    % dig +short @224.0.0.251 -p 5353 <host-name>.local\n\n\nA: Type the command\n  arp -a\n\nThis will show you all connections one by one.\n\nA: You could also use netstat to show network addresses:\nroger.moore@WKSTCAL0141 ~\n$ netstat -n\n\nActive Connections\n\n  Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State\n  TCP    127.0.0.1:11235        127.0.0.1:49184        ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    127.0.0.1:49155        127.0.0.1:49156        ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    127.0.0.1:49156        127.0.0.1:49155        ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    127.0.0.1:49184        127.0.0.1:11235        ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:445     192.168.10.119:52624   ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:1433    192.168.10.2:60866     ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:1433    192.168.10.119:52775   ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:3389    192.168.10.119:54473   ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:49154   192.168.10.119:52796   ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:49182   192.168.10.9:52230     ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:49247   192.168.10.6:445       ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:49432   192.168.10.4:1106      ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:49440   192.168.10.4:1106      ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:49451   192.168.10.6:1025      ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:55100   192.168.10.2:445       ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64558   192.168.10.20:135      TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64559   192.168.10.20:49158    TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64566   192.168.10.100:135     TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64575   192.168.10.100:59811   TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64581   192.168.10.41:139      TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64582   192.168.10.3:5357      TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64585   192.168.10.61:3910     TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64587   192.168.10.65:3910     TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64588   192.168.10.9:139       TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64589   192.168.10.135:2869    ESTABLISHED\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64593   192.168.10.6:135       TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64594   192.168.10.6:1025      TIME_WAIT\n  TCP    192.168.10.131:64599   192.168.10.100:59811   TIME_WAIT\n\n\nA: If you want to know the name using IP:\nhttp://runakay.blogspot.com/2013/12/obtaining-computer-name-from-ip-address.html\n\nA: You can install Wireshark and start a scan on your network card.\nFilter the result by \"nbns\", and you will see the IP address in the upper window.\n\nA: A simple solution that works well for me is to use the nmap tool:\n$ nmap -T4 -sP 192.168.0/24\n\nthe output looks like:\nStarting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-08-08 16:15 CEST\nNmap scan report for 192.168.0.1\nHost is up (0.00061s latency).\nNmap scan report for 192.168.0.5\nHost is up (0.00035s latency).\nNmap scan report for 192.168.0.31\nHost is up (0.043s latency).\nNmap scan report for 192.168.0.39\nHost is up (0.0019s latency).\nNmap scan report for 192.168.0.254\nHost is up (0.0018s latency).\nNmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 2.55 seconds\n\nIt only requires you to know the subnetwork (here 192.168.0) that you wish to scan for.\nOn MacOS, this tool is easily installable using homebrew:\n$ brew install nmap\n\nwhile on most other systems like debian / ubuntu, you will need\n$ apt install nmap\n\n(I do not know about windows and I assume nobody would care on https://apple.stackexchange.com ...)\n", "Q: Can I set Lion scrollbars to always be off? (Except when a mouse is plugged in) I like the fact that scrollbars disappear in Lion, but only if I don't have an external mouse plugged in to my MacBook Pro.  Is there a way to have this behavior always be on?\nI know I can set the vanishing scrollbars to be \"always off\", but I'm basically looking for a way to do the opposite.\nAsked in other way: I know we can set the scrollbars to be Always On in the System Preferences, but looking for a way to do it Automatically NOT based on input device. I don't want to see a scroll bar unless/until a mouse is present on the system. \n\n\nA: The option you mention in System Preferences does exactly what you say (or its behavior was changed since your question).\n\nThe first option, \"Automatically based on input device\" does what you want (I think, but I may have misunderstood your question). When you have a mouse plugged in, it shows the scrollbars. When you unplug your mouse, it will revert to the default of only showing scrollbars when you are scrolling.\nI hope this answered your question. Please let me know if it doesn't, as I probably misunderstood what you are asking.\n\nA: Show ScrollBars: \n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically Based on input device\n\n*When Scrolling \n\n*Always\nThe settings are self explanatory. If you prefer the scrollbar behavior not to change depending on the input device (eg. when you connect an external mouse.) Choose the second option.\n\nA: I don't think there's a specific setting for what you're after, but you could use an application like ControlPlane (formerly MarcoPolo) or Sidekick (there's other alternatives too if you are keen to keep looking).\nThese let you set up different profiles for using your computer in different places or contexts. Typical usage is to detect what location/context based on some inputs (e.g. wireless networks, bonjour hosts on the network, peripherals plugged in) and automatically switch to the appropriate profile (or just let you manually do it). \nProfiles can include things like Network Location, turning on/off Time Machine, changing some system settings, and running various scripts.\nSo for your situation, you'd potentially just have two profiles: Mouse and Trackpad. The presence/lack of your mouse could be detected to allow automatic switching, and you'd have to set up some rule(s) to change the System Settings as required.\nThe appropriate command-line to change your scrollbar viewing would be:\ndefaults write -g AppleShowScrollBars Automatic\n\nFor that last value, you can choose between Automatic, WhenScrolling and Always (i.e. the three options presented in System Preferences) — thanks to this answer for the tip.\nI won't go into too much detail as there's plenty of other places that document the various System Preferences and modification of those via defaults write (you can use defaults read to see various settings for yourself too). So it's then just a matter of coming up with the specific commands to run as you switch between your Mouse and Trackpad contexts.\n(If you've already got different contexts, you might need to duplicate them, e.g. \"At Work with Mouse\" vs \"At Work with Trackpad\" and set them up similarly but with the command to enable/disable scroll bars on switching to said context).\n\nA: Chris is right, set the option he told you about to \"Scrolling\". Now you only get scrollbars while actually scrolling around. (one notable exception being Firefox, which still shows a scrollbar)\n\nA: For the essence of the question – \"Can I set Lion scrollbars to always be off? …\" – the short answer is: \n\n\n*\n\n*no (sorry). \n\n\nNever show scroll bars\nThis seems impossible. \nIn Stack Overflow, under Disabling the auto-hiding of scroll bars on Lion, an answer lists three possible values, none of which compare to never: \n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic\n\n*WhenScrolling\n\n*Always\nWith Mountain Lion, I experimented with an unlisted value – Never – then restarted the computer. Result: scroll bars appeared sometimes. \n", "Q: Application Exposé with fullscreen window? Application Exposé (sometimes known as Application Windows) is a wonderful feature. One that I have wished for very hard! However, it seems it isn't available when an using an application window in fullscreen. Is there a way to enable it there too?\n\nA: It isn't available in full screen because a full screen app has its own space therefore there can't be any app \"behind\" it i.e. no need for Application Expose' \n\nA: \nApplication Exposé (sometimes known as Application Windows) is a wonderful feature. One that I have wished for very hard!\n\nIt's always been there! \nThey basically changed the behaviour from Snow Leopard. Previously, it would show windows, even from other Spaces. Now it shows all the windows of the selected app on that space, and in fullscreen mode there is only one window per space. (It also shows recent documents along with minimized windows at the bottom)\n\nA: Actually, the lack of Exposé - App Windows from fullscreen apps is a big problem that can lead to a buggy situation while using Google Chrome. \nI often use fullscreen mode while using Chrome. While doing so, a certain web app, that I use regularly for work, opens a smaller browser window. Due to the nature of the web app, this smaller browser window can't be opened as a tab and and can't go fullscreen so, instead, it just opens as a smaller second window in the same fullscreen space. For clarity, I'll call the fullscreen window, Window1 and the smaller window, Window2. \nWhile working with this web app, I need to switch back and forth between Window1 and Window2. When I click on Window1, just as expected, it completely covers Window2. The problem is, there is no simple way to switch back to Window2 since Window1 is fullscreen and completely covers it. In fact, Window2 isn't even visible in Mission Control since Mission Control only displays fullscreen apps as one window, even when smaller windows are present in the same fullscreen app space. \nThere are only two ways I know of to switch back to Window2 in this scenario: \n\n\n*\n\n*Get Window1 out of fullscreen mode and then use Exposé (Mission Control or App Windows) to switch back to Window2. \n\n*Just as the previous post states, first move to a desktop space. Then activate Exposé - App Windows and press the tab key until Chrome is the active program again. \nBoth ways are less than ideal. Being able to use Exposé - App Windows from fullscreen apps would easily resolve this problem. But even if Mission Control did show both windows, I still believe using Exposé - App Windows would be much easier to switch between the two. I usually have anywhere from 5 to 10 Applications running at the same time and many of the apps have more than one window. With so many windows open, using Mission Control is just plain overkill when all I want to do is switch between windows in the same application.\nExample\nHere is a link to a dd-wrt demo page where this problem can be easily demonstrated. Make sure you are using Chrome and are in fullscreen mode then click on the more link at the very top-right of the right column to open up a smaller window. Next, click back on the main window. Now try getting back to the smaller window.\n\nA: No, there is no way (right now) to be able to use app exposé in full screen mode. However, I don't think that this is because full screen takes up a whole space, because in Pages, I can have a full screen document open, while I'm working on my window document. I use app exposé and notice that I can see my full screen document, as well as my window document. So it does not have anything to do with full screen taking up a whole space. It seems like a bug. So hopefully Apple fixes this bug, if it is a bug.\n\nA: Actually even in Full Screen mode there can be more than one window. I manage to get up to 3: the main windows, the preferences and the info window. It is as well a little annoying not to be able to easily switch to preferences just hitting the hot corner.\nAnd yes, they are displayable. Not directly from a full screen application desktop, tho. To see all of them just get into Application Windows mode from any non full screen desktop and press \"tab\". That will switch the view to the next active application and when a full screen windows is reached it will show on reduced size, together with its little sisters.\nOtherwise always in Application Windows press \"command (apple)-tab\". You'll get the active application strip. There you can select the full screen application you care about staying in Application Windows mode.\n", "Q: What backups are on my mac?

Mouse movement alone will only wake a sleeping display.\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1776\n\nA: This is actually a feature to prevent accidental movements of the mouse or trackpad effect your Mac from waking up to easily.\nFor me this was a great feature because i use an external monitor with my macbook. If i had my macbook lid closed but forgot my mouse on, a slight movement of my desk would cause my macbook to wake up, but since the lid was closed only the external monitor would work until i go into display settings and click \"detect displays\". this was really annoying because all the windows that were on my MacBooks screen before would be moved over to my main monitor and get thrown all over the place.\n", "Q: External monitor over the air with Macbook I have purchased a second-hand MacBook (13 inch, white) which is quite cool. Now i want to connect it to my external monitor and i have got a Mini-DVI-to-DVI cable from a friend of mine:\n \nHowever, my monitor's DVI input is damaged and i must use a VGA-cable with a DVI-to-VGA adapter on one end:\n\nFurthermore, i can not connect this DVI-adapter to the Mini-DVI-to-DVI cable because it has somehow 4 pins more around the \"bar\" (hope you can see what i mean)... this is the reason why i am searching for a method to connect my Samsung 940 BW as an external monitor - prefferable via network. Is there any Tool/Program that will work with my OS X 10.7 on my MacBook and Windows 7 Ultimate on my PC and extend the \"viewport\" from the Mac to the monitor? Air Display does not support Mac to Windows and MaxiVista is only for Windows!\n\nA: Those extra four pins on your DVI to VGA adapter actually carry the VGA signal; the adapter doesn't actually do any adapting. (The terminology is: DVI-D is digital-only like your mini-DVI to DVI adapter, while DVI-I carries both DVI and VGA, like your cable.)\nThe hardware solution is to get a mini-DVI to VGA adapter (from Apple or elsewhere).\n\nA: RE: \"..

I can see the screen and move the pointer, but the password box refuses any entry, and after about ten seconds my pointer turns into the beachball completely freezing up my mac.\nI was able to temporarily fix the issue by upgrading my system from 4 to 8 GB of RAM which I already had on order, but after a couple boots, it has returned to it's unusable state.\nI have researched some other sites, including the Apple Forums, but I haven't found any great solutions.  I'm wondering if anyone else has/had seen this issue, and knows of a good fix that I can utilize until Apple issues an update.  (which I will have to install somehow after logging in)\nI have a 15 in, 2.4 Ghz i5 MacBook Pro from Spring 2010.  I dual boot with Windows 7 under bootcamp and I have a firmware password set.  Both instances of the freeze have seemed to occur after coming back to the mac side from W7.  I have regular time machine backups.\n\nA: Disable Automatic Graphics Switching\nEDIT:  In diagnosing the issue, you should update to the latest 10.7.2 update\nAfter browsing the Apple Discussions Forums more thoroughly, it seems that disabling automatic graphics switching in the energy/power settings of system preferences seems to prevent the freeze.  \nThis forces the MacBook Pro to use the discrete graphics chip which will consume more battery life, but you can manually switch to the other chip using the utility, GFXCardStatus (http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus) This should make the computer usable until Apple issues a fix in 10.7.1 or whatever is next.\nUnfortunately, users may have trouble just logging into their system to change this setting.  Typing in the password quickly (before the freeze starts) worked for me, but you may have to boot into safe mode instead (hold down shift on boot).\n\nA: I had the same issue with my Macbook Pro that also dual-booted Windows 7 so I went to get it checked at the Apple Store.  Turns out there were numerous corruptions of my hard drive.  I was outside of my one-year warranty but they replaced my hard drive for free anyway.\n", "Q: Applications stop responding when waking up from sleep Lately when I walk away from the computer and it goes into sleep mode, I come back and try to us the computer, all the applications are stuck \"not responding\".\nI can use the computer and browse around, but any application that was open before going to sleep is now stuck. If I try to open Chrome after, it takes forever and 300% CPU. I have to force quit all the apps. Then I reboot (which also takes a long time).\nI have 8GB of RAM on my macbook pro, i7. It only started to happen in the last couple of days. I am running Lion.\nUPDATE: I now suspect something about the process called \"qtkitserver\". It happened today without going to sleep mode. One thing in common also was that uTorrent was running. I read online that QTKitServer is responsible for video thumbnails I think - maybe connected to the fact that I'm downloading videos.\n\nA: You might try seeing if trashing any files that have windowserver in them from ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ and seeing if that helps to temporarily remedy the issue.\nI would expect this to get cleaned up in an official patch once it's certain these files are causing some of the sleep/wake sluggishness - but I've seen anecdotal evidence that this works for some.\n\nA: Have you tried repairing disk permissions and reinstalling Lion?\n", "Q: What are the .mbox files in ~/Library/Mail/Mail Lost+Found/Mailboxes in Mail.app 5.0 (Lion)? When I upgraded to Lion, Mail.app 5.0 created a directory ~/Library/Mail/Mail Lost+Found. There were a couple of outdated bundles, which seems logical. But there is also a Mailboxes directory that has a lot (~30-40) .mbox files. Here is the contents of one of those files:\ntotal used in directory 224 available 282057236\ndrwxr-xr-x   6 kmm  kmm     204 Aug  1 15:55 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  17 kmm  kmm     578 Aug  2 08:47 ..\n-rw-rw-r--   1 kmm  kmm       0 Nov  6  2007 .index.ready\n-rw-rw-r--   1 kmm  kmm  109793 Nov  6  2007 Incoming_Mail\n-rw-rw-r--   1 kmm  kmm    1860 Nov  6  2007 Incoming_Table_of_Contents\n-rw-rw-r--   1 kmm  kmm       0 Nov  6  2007 mbox.SKindex.isValid\n\nIs it safe to delete these files? I haven't opened them all to determine if any contains actual messages. The few I have opened have not.\nThey only occupy 9.5 mb in total, which isn't much, admittedly. But I have something against cruft hanging around when it's not needed.\n\nA: This folder is created by Mail when updating to Lion. I don't think it indicates any problems with a forced shutdown. It's just a place to store the old files after Mail has migrated to its new folder structure in the ~/Library/Mail/V2 folder. If the update is successful, you shouldn't need anything in this folder, except perhaps the contents of the Bundles folder if you want to re-install any plug-ins.\n\nA: The lost+found folder is a special UNIX folder created for a variety of reasons: Most often the lost+found folder is created after a forced shutdown or a power cut. The OS loses track of what was going on and instead of dumping any files or folders it has lost track of, it puts them in the lost+found folder. \nIt's not much to be concerned about , seeing as those are some old files they can probably be safely deleted.\n", "Q: Can Mail.app be configured to always load remote images from certain domains?

Occasionally, someone else may login to it with a different username.\nHow can I start a remote OSX session from Linux ?\n\nA: www.logmein.com is what you're looking for :)\n\nA: Lion is the first Mac OS to let a second person log in via VNC when a different user is logged in. You could have the local account log in automatically and then lock the screen with a password so that the remote people can get to their login screen rather than the \"local\" account.\nSnow Leopard and earlier OS don't have the hooks to spawn off a second graphical interface.

I would like to know if/how is possible to get 4 channel audio from a Mac Mini.\nMy speakers do have two jacks for from/back and currently I can use one one of them.\nIt seams that putting the second jack into the line in doesn't work (some Windows audio boards do let you configure the purpose of the jack socket.\nIs there any solution or should I get used to stereo?\n\nA: Your Mac Mini has optical audio-out, which supports multiple channels.\nApple has cleverly put a little optical transmitter inside the headphone jack (many Macs have this, not just the Mini). To turn it into something useful, you have to use a little adapter (like this one to get a Toslink signal.\nFrom there, it gets interesting.\nYou say that your speakers have to jacks. I assume you mean two analog 3.5mm (headphone) jacks.\nUnless your speakers have a digital or optical input, you'll need to get a receiver that can do the digital-> analog conversion. Something like this should work (there are tons of options, this is just the first one I found).\nThe key is to look for something with digital/optical in, and 4+ channel preamp out.\n\nAnother option: The Mac Mini has HDMI out. You can find a receiver that has HDMI input (like the one above), and 4+ channel preamp out.\n\nA: Receivers are combination devices that do several things in one box, like tuning, amplification, and switching, but you don't need most of that just to decode a multichannel digital signal.\nWhat you're looking for is a surround sound decoder.  Here's one for $60.  I don't know how good it is, but it's far cheaper than any surround receiver I've ever seen.\n", "Q: How do I recover purchased music on my iPhone 4? I replaced my iPhone 4 today and used iTunes to restore all of my settings, contacts, calendars and apps. Everything but my music was restored- including my purchased items. I have tried the iTunes Store on iTunes and on my iPhone and I feel like I'm missing something- is there another step that I should be taking when restoring to retrieve my music?\n\nA: It appears there are multiple ways. The first, is outlined by Apple here.\nAutomatic Downloads and downloading previous purchases are not compatible with iPhone 4 (CDMA Model). Automatic Downloads and downloading past purchased music and TV Shows is supported only in the US and is not compatible with iPhone 4 (CDMA Model).

So yesterday I had to jump through some hoops getting Xcode set up, in the end I had to install it once, uninstall it and then install a different version.  \nAt the start I had ~78GB free.  After the first install it went down to ~75GB as expected.  However when I uninstalled it and installed the other version which requires 10+ GB since it includes the iOS SDK (the version I uninstalled was what came on the disk with my machine).  Now my disk usage reads at ~62 GB, not quite I expect considering my starting amount and the download (4 GB) and the install (10 GB).  My question: is there some cache that just hasn't been cleared yet or is finder just not reporting the disk usage correctly?\n\nA: Not the final answer but a hint in the right direction: I thoroughly recommend DaisyDisk for identifying disk usage. You can drill down by folder to show what you need. Good luck!\n\nA: I know that Finder is not including the space for MobileBackups as used space, but it seems to be connected to backups anyway.  I observed that in the \"Storage\" Tab of \"About this Mac\" the \"Other\" space fluctuates heavily, in particular its size grows when you use space, and does not immediately go down when you free space, there seems to be a delay.\nI observe the same and for a while I thought it has to do with MobileBackups, but these effects remain after disabling MobileBackups.  What Finder (or the Storage tab) displays seems to fluctuate with little connection to reality.  I have the experience that the \"lost space\" will return after a week or so, indicating that it has to do with some sort of backups.\n", "Q: Keychain keeps locking since upgrade to Lion.

Most frequent is the \"Microsoft_Intermediate_Certificates\" prompt for Outlook 2011. \nI have searched all through Keychain Access and have found no solution. I even checked the box for keeping keychains unlocked and still it locks and prompts later.  \n\nA: Are you sure it's a keychain password and not just a standard administrator authentication?\nIt might be wise to run a permissions repair in Disk Utility or run Keychain First Aid from the application menu of Keychain Access.\nIn Keychain Access preferences, you can also elect to show the Keychain's status in the menubar to ensure that it's unlocked when it's supposed to be.\nIt's possible that you have more than one keychain and are being prompted to unlock older unused keychains.

I had to touch wood before typing this, but so far (touches wood again) its run like a dream and I've enjoyed faster performance than I would have had with apps and software running off a single drive (I ran extensive tests on drive configurations with one and all of the above as single and two/three/four drive RAID and this one was the best all-rounder).\nI'm loath to buy more drives - I use a couple of fast external eSata drives for media files and backups (incl. Timemachine ones) so I'd like to devote the onboard drives to performance of OS and apps. A bit of spare space to use as working area for movie editing (this was the primary driver for setting up RAID) would be good too.\nCan anyone suggest an optimum configuration with the above gear? \n\nA: Well you already have a pretty optimal setup. Having the two disks in RAID-0 as your boot drive gives you the greatest possible performance. Just be sure to keep a good backup, since if either disk fails you lose the whole array. Superduper! is great since it makes a bootable backup for you, unlike Time Machine. I highly recommend it. \nOtherwise you're good to go. The only suggestions I have are to buy an SSD for even more performance, and to upgrade your graphics card, you can get a PC 5770 or something for really cheap and it works great.\n", "Q: how do I get a Quicktime video window to play on an external monitor, simultaneously using the laptop for something else? Using Macbook using OS-X 10.5.8, how do I get a Quicktime video window to play on an external monitor, simultaneously using the laptop for something else?\nI have a Macbook circa 2008 which has OS-x 10.5.8.  I recently installed an HDTV in order to watch videos from the Macbook on a larger screen, while continuing to use the laptop for other things. I am unable to play a video on the larger screen unless in the mirror arrangement of the screens.

[Backstory for this question: I'm staying in someone else's apartment currently. All equipment mentioned in this post is being connected to their existing wireless network. That network is broadcast by a Netgear router. Let me know if the specific model is important and I'll dive under the desk and figure it out.]\nI've successfully installed Lion after my little hard drive fiasco. Now it's time to restore the data I have backed up on a Time Capsule I purchased in... early 2009, I believe. \nI had the Time Capsule set both to back up my files automatically and to broadcast a wireless network in my old apartment. I unplugged it and brought it down here to my temporary abode. I plugged it into power and, not having an ethernet cable plugged into it, it flashed amber. So I connected to its impotent wifi network and fired up AirPort Utility, where I reconfigured it to connect wirelessly to the network here. It continued to flash amber. The network it was broadcasting disappeared, and I could not see it in Finder or in AirPort Utility while connected to the wifi network here. \nSo I tried a soft reset. Nothing. Tried a hard reset, which started to work. I found the Time Capsule 10293 network it started broadcasting, and again asked it to connected to the wifi network here. Ran into the same problem: flashing amber, can't find the Time Capsule in AirPort Utility or in Finder. \nIf worse comes to worst, I can tell the Time Capsule not to do anything wireless, and just connect it to my computer with an ethernet cable to perform my data restore. (Which might even be faster than doing it over the air.) But, I don't have a spare ethernet cable lying around here - and more importantly, I want to be able to just plug the Time Capsule into a power outlet, shove it under the bed or something, and have Time Machine continue to back me up on schedule. \nSo: what step am I missing in getting my Time Capsule set up to join an existing wireless network? \nUpdate:\nI haven't made any progress, but I have potentially noticed another symptom. After I do a hard reset of the Time Capsule and look for it in AirPort Utility, I'm warned that I'll have to switch my wireless network to the one being broadcast by the Time Capsule in order to configure it. This is normal, and I connect to Apple Network 2189a98 or whatever just fine. After I change the settings and the Time Capsule restarts and begins to flash amber again, though, I am having trouble re-connecting my MacBook Pro to the regular wireless network here. The AirPort icon in the menu bar does its \"searching...\" animation forever until I turn wifi off and on again, at which point it connects immediately to the wifi network here.\nCuriouser and curiouser. \nUPDATE:\nI have restored the backed up data to my laptop by connecting the Time Capsule and the laptop via an ethernet cable. I'm now trying to set the Time Capsule up manually in Airport Utility. As suggested, I tried to set up the Time Capsule to extend the existing wireless network here... and got this, which seems relevant: \n\nSeems like this might be becoming a question for Super User.\n\nA: You have to hold down the Opt/Alt key when you choose the modus. Or else you will not get the option to choose \"Connect to a wireless network\".\n\nA: Your Time Capsule is not successfully connecting to the router.\n\n\n*\n\n*If possible, move the Time Capsule to the same room as the router until you've got it working properly.\n\n*From within Airport Utility, check for software updates.\n\n*Connect your computer to the Time Capsule with an Ethernet cable. Be sure NOT to use the WAN port on the Time Capsule for this connection.\n\n*Go through the MANUAL setup and check each detail carefully. Save the configuration and let it restart, then if not working, report all settings/messages here. You should be able to see the settings still because you're connected via the cable.\n\n\nEDIT: Have the Time Capsule join the existing network, not extend the network, at least as a first step, as some routers can be configured to disallow extending their networks.\n", "Q: Prevent OS X from changing Spaces after quitting an App? After quitting an application, the previous app that I was interacting with is automatically selected. If I was working in Terminal, switched to Chrome, and then decided to quit Chrome, Terminal becomes the active context. Unfortunately, if Terminal happened to be in a different space at the time, OS X swaps to that space for me.\nThis effect is pretty jarring every time it happens, and it really gets in the way if, say, Chrome was merely restarting. In that case not only do I get sent to a completely different space, but Chrome then opens itself up in that space where I don't want it.\nThe only question I could find similar to my problem was:\nHow can I stop spaces from switching automatically?\nIt suggests to go under System Preferences -> (Spaces / Mission Control), and uncheck When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application.\nWhile this technically solves my problem, I'm now unable to swap to an open application by simply clicking its icon in the Dock. I can live with this if I have to, but I'd rather have a real solution that doesn't require me to sacrifice quick app-switching. \nIdeally I'd like it to switch context to the most-recently used application that's currently open in the existing space. If none exist, default to the Finder.\n\nA: As far as I know, there's no way to do exactly what you want, but you can come pretty close.  It's true that if you uncheck the \"When switching...\" checkbox, you don't go to the app when you click on the icon in the dock, but you do go to the app when you double click it (or just generally click it a second time when the application is active but nothing is visible).  \nI've been using it this way for years - I'd almost forgotten there was any other behavior.\n\nA: This works on 10.6.8. Just used it myself. Enjoy!\n\nFor Leopard 10.5.0–10.5.2, the solution was to access a hidden\n  preference for Spaces by issuing the following command in a Terminal\n  or xterm (X11) window: \ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO\nthen restarting the Dock using the following command: \nkillall Dock\n\nSource\n\nA: You can force apps to open in certain spaces from System Preferences, which would solve the problem of Chrome opening in a space it shouldn't.\nThe drawback is that I don't think it will stop the transition from one space to another, and then back again.\n", "Q: Is it possible to automate FTP in Terminal?

I've read they both have support for Proxies but I can't find anything in either of the Apps nor any relevant documentation around the internet. \n\nA: It requires that the IRC server in question already making itself availble as a Tor service. Apparently Freenode does this  at the address (THIS IS AN OLD ADDRESS) mejokbp2brhw4omd.onion, but most IRC servers don't.  While not strickly nessecary alot of IRC servers block TOR exit nodes.  You can try by replacing the .onion address in the socat line and see if it works.\nUPDATED Freenode IRC Service: The onion address of Freenode has changed: p4fsi4ockecnea7l.onion\nYou can always check this by using dig +short irc.tor.freenode.net cname from a Un*x command prompt.\nThe basic idea is to use socat to create the TORified connection for us, and our client will connect to socat.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Tor. I'm using the Vidalia bundle from the Tor download page.\n\n*Install socat. This is a command-line power tool for manipulating network connections.\nI recommend using the Homebrew package manager (also a command-line program) to install it. If this all sounds confusing and scary, just open up Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities), paste the following line, press enter and wait for it to finish.\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)\" && brew install socat\n\n(Pasting commands into the Terminal like this can do anything to your computer, so it's usually a bad idea unless you trust the source.)\n\n*NOTE: This step is not nessecary as we are already using socat which can handle the mapping for us. \nThe rest of this step is left for historical purposes.\nEdit your torrc file to create an internal IP address to use to connect tor and socat by adding the line\nMapAddress 172.28.184.12 mejokbp2brhw4omd.onion\n\n(replacing the .onion address if you're not using freenode). Tor has an FAQ entry about how to modify your torrc file, but if you trust me and are using Vidalia as well you can just enter this in the Terminal:\nmkdir -p ~/.vidalia/ && echo 'MapAddress 172.28.184.12 mejokbp2brhw4omd.onion' >> ~/.vidalia/torrc\n\n\n*Create a new launch daemon (background system process) to initialize socat when you turn your computer on.

I notice that if I lightly press on it, I can hear a click (sometimes faint, sometimes clearly audible) but no click action is performed. If I firmly press, then the click goes through as expected, but instead of one clear click noise, I hear a faint click followed by a louder click.\nHas anyone heard of this before? Is it normal behavior? If not, how should I go about fixing the problem? The laptop is under warranty, so do I simply go to an Apple store and ask them to fix it for me? If so, how long does it take to replace a trackpad? \nThanks.\n\nA: The Apple repair folks won't actually replace the trackpad  itself, but they will adjust the tensioner underneath the trackpad. I had the same issue in my brand new Macbook Pro, and they were able to solve the issue.\n\nA: I have the same problem. I took it to the Apple Store and they looked at it and they didn't even open it up to see what is wrong.

Historically, it was possible to hide users from the login screen.

I have moved from a Mac running Snow Leopard to a new Lion machine. Since there was a lot of cruft on the old machine, I set up the new one from scratch, only copying the data over I need. I still want to retain the Time Machine backup of my old machine for a while in case I missed something. That backup spans many months though and is huge. I really just need the latest backup from it, not its whole history.\nIs it safe to simply open the Time Machine sparsebundle in Finder or on the CLI and remove the oldest folders? Or should I be using some Time Machine interface or tool to do so? I don't want to do it via the Starfield view, since it'll take me ages to click back and forth and delete each backup individually.\n\nA: Time Machine has supported deleting snapshots from Finder since 10.7:\n\nLike tmutil delete, it only works with the directories for complete snapshots though.\nI don't know why it's not allowed normally, but you can delete individual files with something like sudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Helpers/bypass rm -rf /Volumes/Time\\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/Macintosh/2012-10-04-033043/HD/tmp.\nHard links don't stop working when the original files are removed:\n$ echo x > 1; ln 1 2; rm 1; cat 2\nx\n\nThere's another similar question at Super User.\n\nA: You are OK to go ahead and delete the older backups using the Finder. \nJust beware that any files that only exist in these backup periods will be gone. Deleting backups on command doesn't preserve files or merge/combine backups like the normal Time Machine pruning does in an effort to keep as many files available on the backup as possible.\n\n\nA: tl;dr - It's safe to delete in whatever way you choose.\nThe only conceivable problem would be if Time Machine was trying to prune a backup at the same time you were deleting, so maybe turn off Time Machine for the duration of your clean up if you're not using the built in delete button.\n\n\nYou can use tmutil delete in Lion to safely delete backups. The benefit of this is the deletion happens more silently in the background. The downside is the UI isn't speedy for deleting more than one snapshot at a time. In practice, you have to be there to attend multiple deletions.\nDon't worry about the internals of how files are linked or stored - yes most of the files in most of the backups are hard links, but to clean these up, you have to delete things folder by folder. The system will handle decrementing the link count so there's no better or worse way to go here.\nIt is also safe to simply remove them via Finder or any other method - just be patient as each backup contains a full set of directory entries for each file. My (worst) record is 4 days to delete through finder a batch of unwanted backups.\nGood advice might be to start small if you can't leave your mac on overnight.\nYou won't lose any data unless you are deleting the last copy of a version of some file. You don't get any warnings, it will get deleted - this is the same whether you use Time Machine itself, or Finder or rm in some terminal script.\n\nAs a brief aside - Why do you want to do this? Time Machine automatically prunes old backups when you're getting low on space. I've found it very comforting to just clone my Time Machine drive to a cheap USB external drive and put it on the shelf. (or make this the drive on the shelf and use it as an excuse to get a new drive) Perhaps it's the perfect pack-rat-keep-everything verses if-you-don't-need-it-now's-the-time-to-delete-it test for Mac users.\n\nA: I would recommend against using Finder to delete backups, however it is certainly possible from inside Time Machine itself. When you're in Time Machine, navigate the window to the Computer setting, in the sidebar it should be the name of your computer. When that is the active window, the \"Gear\" icon on the toolbar changes its functionality. Go \"back in time\" to the date that you don't want any more and click on the Gear icon. Select \"Delete Backup\" from the menu and enter your administrator password if prompted and let Time Machine do its thing. This allows Time Machine to update its database and keep the links it makes intact.\n", "Q: How to list all available .plist keys on a certain domain application by defaults command? I want to know all keys (property list) which available on certain domain application, as example I could list available key for com.apple.dock by entering this command:\n$ defaults read com.apple.dock\n\nbut somehow the output of this command only showed the active property list key, and yet not all available key for com.apple.dock listed there.\nAnyone can help me on this?\n\nA: This is not a trivial task, if I recall correctly people run the strings utility at the command-line against an Application, and look for things that match a structure similar to com.domain.FeatureName. (com.apple.iTunes, ch.cyberduck.CyberDuck, com.panic.Coda, etc.)\nThe likely easiest way to manage these overrides is by a System Preferences Pane by the name of Secrets. Using this installs a Preference Pane into System Preferences, and gives you an interface into choosing an application and changing their settings to your particular preference.\n\nA: Found a website dedicated to these Mac OS X defaults write commands, some handy commands for Mac OS X Lion & Mountain Lion.\nhttp://www.defaults-write.com\n\nA: There really isn't a notion of \"available\" keys. The application is free to read whatever keys it wants. Most people discover \"secret\" defaults keys by using strings to look through the application binary to see what keys it will try to read.\n\nA: Most people here want to do everything via the command line, but I have a more practical suggestion.\nThese two programs described below list a great deal of the known command-line customizable features of Mac OS X applications, sorted by application or function. The advantage is the list of functions is provided for you; you don't have to go searching Google to find out what the functions are and the command-line sequences needed to modify each one.\nThere are several freeware or commercial applications that provide a graphical user interface listing most all of the customization options that can be modified via the Terminal. To activate any of these features, using these progams I'm describing, you do it within the application's GUI and you have no need to use the command line at all. You don't need to know anything about defaults write or .plist files.\nTwo of these apps are:\nTinkerTool\nwhich is free, and\nMacPilot\nwhich has just been updated with new Lion features, and costs US $20.00.\nThese are programs that I own and use.\nDownload the free TinkerTool and the trial version of MacPilot and and click through all the tabs to see all the myriad features you can customize. There are too many to list here.\n\n\nUpdate\nDeveloper Frederik Wiker has released freeware apps (donations accepted) for creating defaults write customizations specific to Lion and Mountain Lion; many of them also work fine for Mavericks (Mac OS X 10.9) as well.\nDownload these and see what customizations are available to you.\nLion Tweaks\nMountain Tweaks\n\n\nA: Perhaps a fairly long explanation how things work might clear up your and others' search for these \"hidden\" preferences.\nMost applications will read their preference files once when they start and the defaults tool exists to ensure the preference files are a valid structure and don't contain syntax errors. (It also allows the system to change how the keys are stored and people don't have to know the implementation details and can use the defaults command to do all the reading and writing.)\nEnglish language style and grammar guides ensure the words I type here are meaningful to the average english speaker, and standardizing the defaults system sets a framework so everyone knows what to expect. The preference list formatting is far more rigid and mathematical than a human language, but the concepts are similar.\nThe the Mac OS X user defaults system is a key value store (or database if you prefer). \nYou can write anything into these preference key value stores, a Shakespeare sonnet, numbers, a shopping list. If the program is coded to look for a specific key, it will read the value stored. If it's not looking for that key - it's value sits there unused and unread.\nThis brings up how to know what values a specific program might be looking for when they start up. It boils down to you either have to know the value or reverse-engineer the program.\nMany tools exist to look into a program and try to figure out what strings (the keys) are embedded, such as strings and dbx/lldb as well as linking in your own library to dump the internal structure of a specific program.\nIn practice, some things that are needed for testing are added in this \"hidden\" way so that you can't look over the program's preference pane and see these new features that are not ready for broad use. In a way, it's not at all simple to get a comprehensive list unless the author of that program releases the source code or otherwise documents these settings publicly.\nWhen you read the defaults store for a particular app - you are just reading the \"book\" that was written when the app created it's default set or the settings that shipped with the Mac OS X. That is why you don't receive the exhaustive list of things that are realistically possible to change with that application.\n\nA: As far as I know an application will only store a new key if it differs from its defaults, at least that's what my apps do.\nThis is not something that can be controlled easily as it is part of the User Defaults framework, as the app only tell user defaults what needs to be stored and it takes care of the rest.\nI don't think that the information you are looking for is going to be easily obtained, sadly. It could be nice though to have access to this.\n", "Q: Dealing with ads blocking application functionality on iPad I've noticed some applications on my iPad have advertisements. The problem is that the advertisement covers lower part of the screen where some applications place buttons and other UI elements, and the ad blocks there elements and prevents me from properly using the application. Is there any way to solve this - like move the ad somewhere or temporarily remove it? It's OK when the ads are just annoying but when they actually prevent me from using the application it's bad.\n\nA: If this problem happens in an App than your only chance is tell the developer of the app that the ad placement was a really bad user interface choice and to please fix this issue.\nIf you can provide screenshots and a brief description of when this happens (if it only happens under certain circumstances) they will most probably be very grateful and fix this problem ASAP.\nJust as a precaution: be polite in your email and try to be as objective as possible when telling about your problem.\n", "Q: Is iPad a multi-tasking device? Is the iPad 2 a truly multi-tasking device? e.g. Can I listen to some kind of audio formats (not via iTunes) in the background while surfing on Safari ?\n\nA: iOS devices could always play play audio in the background. From iOS 4, 3rd party apps may also run in the background, but the multitasking ability is restricted. Applications which aren't running are frozen to save CPU and battery life. However there are 7 background API's which may execute in the background : \n\n\n*\n\n*Background audio\n\n*Voice over IP\n\n*Background location\n\n*Push notifications\n\n*Local notifications\n\n*Task finishing\n\n*Fast app switching\n\n\nSee here for more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_(Apple)#Multitasking\n\nA: Of course you can. Audio is normally played through the Music(iPod) app which can run in the background whilst you browse safari. \nGive it a try.\n\nA: It's even better than that. If you start playing an audio source in safari you can go to another app and it will usually keep on playing.\n\nA: See Ars Technica's review of iOS4 for information on iPad multitasking.\n\nA: iOS (like the Mac OS) is based on BSD Unix. The OS can 'truly' multitask - and it has done from day one. A lot of processes run under the hood, even whilst your device is 'sleeping'.\nAs already stated here, Apple have recently opened some of this kind of functionality to developers with a selection of APIs.\n\nA: This has been possible ever since the first iPhone. When people used to say iOS couldn't multitask, but this wasn't exactly true. You've always been able to quit an app and return to it, and if it was well-coded, it'd return to it's previous state at the time of ur last use of it.

In that file you would find ways to tweak things like the old \"clamshell\" mode. I have not looked in Lion yet to see if this still exists, but if the file is still there, you may want to take a look at what it allows you to control. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Not sure if it will still work with Lion, but on SL I use InsomniaX when I want to close the lid and prevent my mbp from sleeping. Check out the following links for similar programs:\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/22211/insomniax\nhttp://alternativeto.net/software/insomniax/\n\nA: I made a LaunchAgent which does this.\nThe source code can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Tyilo/Lid-sleep\n", "Q: How do I disable mobile Youtube redirection on iPad? When I click a Youtube link, say, in the newly released Skype app, the iPad will open the link in Safari, which will load the mobile site. Also in Twitter's built in browser the mobile site is displayed. This sucks, because the site is slow and often fails loading a video at all.\nIs there a way to stop Youtube redirecting to m.youtube.com on iPad?\n\nA: In short: no, you can't stop it. It's Google re-directing you.  \nYou can work around it though. You can scroll down to the very bottom of the page and tap the \"desktop\" link, which will take you to the full desktop version of the site. If what you want is the YouTube app to open, then all you can do is copy the name of the video from safari into the YouTube app.\nI know what you mean about it not loading the videos. It's annoying!\n\nA: Mobile seems to work better for me on my iPad, yet they keep redirecting me to the desktop version. I clicked it once to check messages because apparently you can't do that on mobile anymore.\nThey seriously discriminate against non desktop users. We can't watch half the videos because of restrictions. We can't even check messages now the app is dreadful it randomly changes quality of video to the lowest possible definition in the middle of a video. It seriously puts me off! My advice for you, however, tell YouTube you want it to redirect you to mobile version. 99.9% of the time they do the opposite to what you ask, so it should work!\n\nA: I've been stuck the other way around and was looking how to prevent from redirecting to desktop on mobile and found following answer in te thread We've redirected you to the desktop website. Return to mobile YouTube.:\n\nSwitch to Mobile:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/?app=m&persist_app=1\nSwitch to Desktop:\nhttps://youtube.com/?app=desktop&persist_app=1\nSave both links as bookmarks and you'll be able to switch that way.\n\n\nA: Go to Settings, tap on General, tap on Restrictions, enable Restrictions if you haven’t already, and disallow YouTube. \nDoing so has the dual benefit of redirecting all YouTube links to the mobile website and hiding the native app on the device, clearing up more space for apps you actually want to use.\n\nA: Try YouTube link on chrome instead of safari also enable open links in chrome setting in YouTube app of iPad.\n", "Q: Where can I read the full Lion EULA? I haven't been able to find this via Google. In particular, I am interested in reading about whether or not a Snow Leopard license is a prerequisite for installing Lion, and the new virtualisation rules.\nDoes anyone have a link to this?\n\nA: After Lion is in installed, the license (EA0730 revised 2011-06-01) is amongst the documentation: \n/Library/Documentation/License.lpdf\n\n\nA: All Apple's hardware & software product agreements can be found at: http://www.apple.com/legal/sla/\nHere's straight link to Lion's agreement.\n\nAnswers to your particular interests can both be found under § 2. B:\n\n[…] you are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license:\n(i) to download, install, use and run for personal, non-commercial use, one (1) copy of the Apple Software directly on each Apple-branded computer running Mac OS X Snow Leopard or Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server (“Mac Computer”) that you own or control;\n[…]\n(iii) to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments on each Mac Computer you own or control that is already running the Apple Software.\n\n", "Q: When ever I press right shift it show Desktop, but in the setting 'Show Desktop' is set to Control Down And when I assign other command to left shift it display error, and when I press the sign it redirect me to the keyboard shortcut, which does not display any conflict...\nI just want to use my right shift ToT\n\nA: I just had the same issue! I am using an external keyboard, btw, but I believe this fix should be the same.\nFirst I just went ahead and restarted, then after my right shift was still acting wonky, I went into the Keyboard Shortcuts preferences, and changed the shortcut to numpad0. I saved it and did a restart again, then it was fixed.\n\nI'm not sure if using the numpad altered the issue, or if all it took was multiple restarts, but before that, even if I disabled \"Show Desktop\" it would still be active as my Right Shift.\nOn a weird note, my show desktop used to be a 3 finger swipe down on the trackpad, but now that option isn't even available for me to select. Odd.\n\nA: Go to Mission Control and select nothing ('-') for Application windows. This helped me.\n", "Q: Alfred toggles very slowly On a MacBook5,2 running OSX 10.5, with only 2GB RAM, Alfred toggles very slowly, like up to 5 seconds after the keystroke.\nAfter I've just toggled it, it will toggle again much faster, but after a while it will be slow again.\nWhat can I do to identify and fix the problem?\nIIRC it does that even with the computer just started, so it's unlikely it's already swapping, but I'm open to suggestions.\n\nA: I'd recommend turning off fade-in animation under Appearance where you'll see \"Fade in Alfred window\".\nThe only reasons Alfred would be slow are either RAM swapping and you're out of memory or, unlikely but possible, could be due to a network drive that is still being looked for after being disconnected.\n\nA: Look on the features pane of the Alfred preference window. Untick any unnecessary options.  That should speed Alfred up.\n", "Q: I upgraded to Lion. Where's my TRIM support? I upgraded to Lion a couple of weeks ago, looking forward to the promised TRIM support on my 2009 MacBook Pro. It seems that the upgrade hasn't enabled it. There doesn't seem to be any way of doing so in the disk manager. Am I missing something?\n\n\nA: Have you booted into recovery mode and try \"repair disk\" using Disk Utility to ensure updated drivers on the SSD? It should have happened at installation, but several lion installs silently failed to make even a Recovery HD for me.\nIt's a guess, but I could see Disk Utility perhaps correcting that oversight.\nI would certainly open a ticket with Apple Care - you get 90 days of phone support with any purchase and can even schedule a call back from the web site I linked. It might initially warn you about pay per incident, but later on you can select this exemption:\n\n", "Q: What happened to the Finder window 'jellybean' in OS X Lion? Before I updated to Lion, whenever I would mount a disk image (.dmg) the Finder window that would pop-up would always have a little 'jellybean' in the top right corner that would expand this window into a 'full' Finder window with the left-side panel, thus allowing quick and easy access to be able to eject the disk image.\n\nI do not know if this feature has been completely removed from the OS or if its just disabled. Is there a way to get this back? I miss the jellybean!\n\nA: Note that the lozenge or \"jellybean\" as you call it used to show and hide the toolbar.  Pre-Lion, it did exactly the same thing as the cmd-opt-T keyboard shortcut, and this shortcut remains in effect in Lion.\nLion adds a new cmd-opt-S shortcut which toggles only the sidebar (which is in any event displayed only when the toolbar is already present).\n\nA: It was removed completely in Lion.\nTo eject disk images I normally just drag the icon in the window title to the trash. Quick and simple. You can also right click on the window background and eject it via the context menu.\n\nA: The jellybean was removed completely in Lion. However, keystroke Opt-Cmd-T or menu option View - Show Toolbar will achieve the same thing.\nI miss the jellybean too!\n\nA: You can also eject with a keyboard shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the Finder window of the disk image (click the background to deselect anything).\n\n\n*Press Command+E to eject the disk image.\n", "Q: Old iPhone help I don't have AT&T anymore but have an unactivated iPhone with a new sim card.  Is there any way to use it like an iPod touch - without setting up an AT&T account. I don't have the old sim card; previous owner kept card.\n\nA: Sadly (for you), Apple only activates the OS on phones that have a current valid wireless account. The official answer is to keep the valid SIM with the device and take the SIM off the account when selling/donatinge the phone.\nIf you can't get that original SIM, you still have options. You will need an active SIM card to get things activated. (And likely that phone is locked to AT&T - so it will likely need to be an AT&T SIM) If so, the easiest is buying a $6 SIM from AT&T and they have stores all over the place.\nOnce activated through iTunes, that SIM will work to activate that device in iTunes even if the account expires or that SIM card is no longer active.\nYou can also jailbreak and/or unlock the device, but that can be more work if you worry a newer OS might tempt you to re-do the jailbreak or unlock work.\n", "Q: Small-Business iPhone Deployment I have a friend who has managed to successfully lobby his employer to switch the company-issued \"feature phones\" to iPhones. He has been peppering me with questions on how to set these phones up with employees' and the employer's Apple IDs.\n(The company has between one and two dozen employees, so they're definitely not at the level that Apple considers \"Enterprise\". Plus they're in Canada, so the new business app store isn't available to them yet.) \nIdeally the employees would be allowed to install their own non-business-related apps, music, videos, etc. In addition, a number of business-related apps need to be installed, some of which may be expensive. \nHere's what I'm going to suggest to them:\nEach employee should be assigned their own company Apple ID using their company email address and a password that will be known only to the IT guy. The billing information will be set up to bill to a company credit card. \nCompany apps would be installed (and updated) using this Apple ID and password (this would probably happen only infrequently). Personal apps would be installed and updated with the person's personal Apple ID. \nThat way if and when an employee leaves the company, the expensive business apps can stay with the company/device, and the employee's extensive collection of Lady Gaga remixes can stay with their iTunes account and any subsequent devices they purchase. \nThe only workable alternative would be to purchase all company apps with the same Apple ID. Unfortunately this runs afoul of the (non-personal-use) App Store T&Cs. \nAny advice or alternatives I've overlooked would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: I recently went through a similar proof of concept corporate iPad deployment and had the same questions walking in. The direction we went might not be the best solution, but it worked for us and maybe it will give you a hand with your deployment.\nKnow your Audience\nEarly in our deployment it became glaringly obvious that this would have to be a simple solution. Apple devices are designed to be simple, that's the draw in the corporate world. Our main audience was managers, VPs, and CXX level executives. A good number of these folks either aren't technically savvy enough to deal with a complicated configuration, or simply don't have the time to fuss with a device.\nIt should just work, out of the box, like it was designed.\nJust Say NO to Multiple Accounts\nFirstly I can see one big problem with your initial plan. By stating that you have an account created with a secret password I'm assuming that you're having a helpdesk configure the devices and install the software before they're handed over to your end users. What happens when an application is updated in the AppStore? Your helpdesk will have to enter the password to have the application updated. Depending on the size of your company this could eat up a ton of time, and most of your end users most likely won't ever bother to go through the process to upgrade.\nAdditionally, when John Doe leaves the company, the software purchased for jdoe@acme.com will be assigned to John's replacement Fred Flinstone and his iPhone. You now have fflinstone@acme.com using the account jdoe@acme.com. It might not be a big problem at first, but this will easily get difficult to manage down the road.\nMobile Device Management\nDepending on the size of your deployment you might eventually start looking at one of the many Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions out there. We did. It's likely that things will change in the future, but as of this posting we didn't find much that an MDM solution would bring to the table that our Exchange environment wouldn't already provide.\nMDM offers a simplistic way to deploy VPN, Wi-Fi, and user profiles. If you're not using Exchange or aren't comfortable with rolling your own solution you might gain more from one then we were able. Other benefits would be device tracking, and enabling your helpdesk to do basic device troubleshooting, device wiping, remote locking, etc. Read the link to Wikipedia above for more information and a decent list of the bigger vendors in the field.\nApplication Purchasing\nWe first identified a list of applications that we would recommend for different tasks, and published the list and relevant links on our company intranet. Initially we installed a few applications when we initially configured the device, but ran in to the time problem above. We calculated a total estimated dollar figure of all applications that an average user would purchase and bought gift cards for that amount + an additional X% for growth. This was more convenient for how we do purchases then gifting would have been.\nApple recently announced their Volume Purchase Program (VPP), and you might want to look in to that if the solution above isn't any help.\nFurther Reading\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone in Business\n\n*Gartner Magic Quadrant for MDM\n\n*iPhone Business Profiles\nBest of luck to you, we learned that smart devices in the enterprise is a rapidly growing environment and there's no \"right way\" to do things yet. Apple is constantly improving their tools to make the transition better, but they're not quite there yet.\n\nA: Having two accounts on a device is a real hassle. Until it makes sense for the company to get a Dunn & Broadstreet number and go enterprise, the gifting of apps is the easiest way to go.\nIf the app allows them to perform a critical job function, how is even $500 a year \"expensive\" when you are paying a salary, benefits, insurance. I don't mean to trivialize any IT expense, but would anyone want to work with a company that's so cheap, they won't pay for tools that make sense? Especially tools that let it's employees get work done 24/7 wherever they have a cell signal.\nWe're not talking about $25k which is a ballpark true costs of a 10 person laptop deployment covering one year and light software. If you look at this from a productivity / ROI standpoint - iOS deployments are some of the cheapest on the planet as well as the easiest to justify. Just buy apps that are obvious winners in the next 6 to 18 months and assume your employees will stick around.\n\nThat being said, most deployments I have seen end up layering a work Apple ID for work purchases and a personal Apple ID for personal purchases. At some point, people will be more comfortable expensing iOS app purchases like they expense hotel rooms and instead of worrying about losing all the purchases, they will learn that losing only a fraction of the apps when an employee leaves or changes roles isn't as expensive in practice as it seems when you start upon a project where all apps are purchased through Apple's app store ecosystem.\n\nThere is Apple Business Manager and VPP as well, but it's not clear that the benefit in flexibility outweighs signing up for MDM and VPP and just expensing apps, but if you want to start for free with a very well supported MDM that is targeted for small organizations that don't necessarily have IT staff, the best for a few years going is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jamf Now - https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/\n\n*Apple Business Manager - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208817\nI would go with JAMF Now until the cost outweighs the benefit and then stop paying for that the next month you don't feel you benefit from it or go back to the 3 free devices to manage. I wouldn't start down VPP / Business until you've spent $1000 and have 10 devices to manage for the average team, but you situation and funding might tilt the balance higher or lower based on how much you value the time of the people that will manage / set up / learn how this all works.\n\nA: The difference for the enterprise development account is only $299 versus $99. I think it would save him a lot of hassle to just set one up IMHO.\n\nA: Your best bet is to wait until Apple's Volume Purchase Program is available worldwide, which will no doubt happen fairly quickly. I'm in australia and can't wait for it myself.\nUntil then, there is no good way to do what you're looking for except for the employees to purchase the software and be reimbursed by their boss. Since most apps are only worth a few bucks, and almost never over $50 or so, that's not such a big ask — compared to the tens of thousands per year already being paid to each employee. You could also take advantage of the gift voucher feature, to provide employees with the funds prior to them purchasing the app.\nHaving a personal Apple ID in addition to one that the business controls is not a good solution. My phone is registered with three different Apple ID's and it's not for the feint of heart, you can do it but it's a hassle. And there's not going to be any way to transfer those licenses over to the VPP system once it's available.\n", "Q: File sizes greyed out (strange extended attributes) in Finder on Lion?

You may have not disabled that in your testing (a safe boot should confirm / rule this out as well). It seems possible that it's intentionally showing you which folders it has replaced the normal .DS_store file with entries in /usr/local/.dscache\nI would also use mdls to inspect the metadata for these folders (since apps are really folders these days) in case some clue jumps out at you.\n\nA: It seems that those Apps are only sym links. Maybe those apps are in your ~/Applications folder, and are linked to the /Applications one.\nCould you check it.\nEdited to reflect the edit of the author.\n", "Q: Increase volume of alarm in countdown timer? iPhone's \"Clock App\" has a countdown timer which sounds an alarm when the countdown is down.\nIs there a way to make the alarm significantly louder?\n\nA: There are three avenues to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*get a soft toothbrush and make sure the speaker grill is clean and free of debris\n\n*position the phone so the speaker echoes/reverberates from a hard reflective surface that channels the sound to your ears.\n\n*choose custom alarm tones that are audio compressed and recorded \"hot\" and perhaps alternate loud/soft as your brain will hear the changes as more relevant than a flat loud monotone\n\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no (official) way to increase the volume above the configured maximum. Some of the default sounds provided are quieter then others, you might consider using the \"Alarm\" sound, or set two alarms minutes apart.\nIf this still doesn't work you might consider a jailbreak application.

I've downloaded the 64 bit Version of iTunes and I'm wondering why it's running as a 32 bit application under Windows 7 (of course 64 bit)?\nAny Ideas?\n\nA: The 64-bit version of iTunes you downloaded contains 64-bit drivers for Windows 7, however the application itself is still a 32-bit application.  You should see your iTunes installed in (default) C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ and the iPod helper files installed in C:\\Program Files. \n", "Q: Does adjusting the volume in iTunes alter audio quality?

I have a 500 GB hard drive on my MacBook Pro. I have OS X 10.7 (Lion) on my main partition and Windows 7 Ultimate on a secondary partition. Because I have older applications that I would like to run in OS X 10.5 (Leopard), I was thinking of creating an additional partition and install either Leopard on it. This raises the following questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*What are the license restrictions on doing this type of install if I\nown all the software?  \n\n*What are the license restrictions on using virtualization tools like VMware Fusion to access these partitions? I have read the only OS X Leopard Server was allowed to run    virtualized, but I cannot seem to find an authoritative answer on\nthis. I do not have Leopard Server, but regular Leopard.\n\n*Are these license restrictions different in Snow Leopard?\n\n\nAnd then, there are the technical questions, like: Does VMWare even allow for me to access, say virtualized Lion from Leopard or virtualized Leopard from Lion? I know I can get to the Windows partition from either one, but I have never tried any OS X virtualized. What are your thoughts? Thanks. \n\nA: Legally, you can only run OS X Server in a virtual machine for 10.5 and 10.6. With Lion, they allowed regular OS X installations to run in up to two virtual machines. VMWare Fusion does support Leopard and Snow Leopard Server virtual machines (but not yet Lion), but I don't know if it will let you use the same installation both booted from disk and in a virtual machine.\n", "Q: 'which' location different from executable location I'm trying to install ruby/rubygems on the latest version of 10.6.

This mean, if I update it, I will not go back to 3.1.3??\nWhy it not save for other 4.x versions?? Am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: TinyUmbrella can only save the SHSHs for firmware versions that still get signed by Apple. 3.1.3 isn't signed by Apple anymore (i.e. they don't want you to downgrade to it), and therefore you don't get the SHSHs anymore.\n", "Q: Growl notifications when a user logs in to Minecraft server? Would love to be able to get a Growl notification when a user logs in to my (locally hosted) Minecraft server.\nI took a peek in the Console but it doesn't seem to record the logins, although my server GUI shows activity on the server including logins.\nIt runs within Java, so maybe that's the issue with it not showing up in the Console, although some of my actions do seem to get recorded, but those seem related to the main Minecraft app and not the server.\nEven if I could find the logs, I am at a loss as to how one sets up a Growl notification, although I assume it has to do with growlNotify: http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify\n\nA: The minecraft server writes a log file into the directory minecraft_server.jar is installed in. From there you can use something like\ntail -f server.log | \n  while read m_date m_time m_type m_user m_ip m_action m_rest; do\n    if [[ $m_action == logged ]]; then\n      growlnotify -n Minecraft -m \"$m_user logged in at $m_date $m_time\" Minecraft;\n    fi\n  done\n\nStarting this automatically together with your Minecraft server is possible but depends on the way you do start it.\nTo install this (without going too deep into Unix territory, ask an expert if it fails):\n\n\n*\n\n*open Terminal.app\n\n*change to the directory where minecraft_server.jar is installed by typing cd followed by drag&dropping the folder with the server into the terminal window followed by return\n\n*nano mc2growl\n\n*write #!/bin/bash and press return (twice)\n\n*paste the code from above\n\n*press ^X and say Y at the prompt\n\n*chmod +x mc2growl\n\n*./mc2growl &\n\nA: (Full disclosure: This is my app.)\nI've made an app for Mac and Windows that does this, even for vanilla servers and Minecraft Realms servers!\nhttp://www.creeprapp.com\n", "Q: Apple Store Macbook Pro DVI and VGA Adapter questions - what is in the box? The company I work for recently ordered me a Macbook Pro and I received the shipping confirmation today. Among the machine configuration there is listed the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*DVI Adapter 065-0106 None\n\n*VGA Adapter 065-0108 None\n\n\nWhat do these lines mean? Does it mean that these adapters are not part of the configuration? If not is there still a way for me to hook up an external monitor that has a DVI or VGA input? \n\nA: The video out on MacBook Pro uses a Displayport / Thunderbolt port. To hook up to a VGA or DVI cable, you need an adapter. Alternatively you could buy a cable which has Displayport on one end and DVI or VGA on the other. The adapters don't come as standard so you'll need to buy one in an Apple store, online or use a third-party cable.\n\nA: Apple always put these lines to confirm they are or are not in the package, don't worry.

Then assign a keyboard shortcut for the service from \"System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\".\n\n\nI don't recommend this option, because at least on my system, there is at best a delay of around half a second before an application is focused by a keyboard shortcut created using this method, and the delay is often even longer. There has also been a bug since 10.7 where the keyboard shortcuts for Automator services don't always work until you hover over the services menu from the menu bar. (Edit: it's now 8 years after I wrote this answer and the bug still hasn't been fixed.) Also the keyboard shortcuts for services are not available in some applications like Emacs.\n\nA: Get Quicksilver, http://www.blacktree.com/, it will allow you to set keyboard shortcuts to open apps. There are actually more many more apps that do this (Alfred, Keyboard Maestro etc etc.)\nMac OS X actually has a built-in way of doing that, but it doesn't work for Firefox, because it doesn't support services! http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090903085255430\nUpdate Jan 2012: Blacktree no longer updates Quicksilver--the developer went to Google and has released Google Quick Search Box. Quicksilver lives on, but it has a new home at qsapp.com. \n\nA: As of macOS Monterey, you can set up a global hotkey via the Shortcuts app. This will either launch the app or switch to it if it's already running.\nUse the Open App option and under settings, pick a shortcut from 'Run with'.\nWorks together nicely with a hyper key.\n\n\nA: There are plenty of good options here but I wanted to add my personal favorite which I've been using since 10.5 and still works on 10.11.2: Spark 3.\nhttp://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark.php\nIt's freeware and extremely easy to set up.  Here's the developer's description:\n\nSpark is a powerful, and easy Shortcuts manager. With Spark you can\n  create Hot Keys to launch applications and documents, execute\n  AppleScript, control iTunes, and more... You can also export and\n  import your Hot Keys library, or save it in HTML format to print it.\n  Spark is free, so use it without moderation!\n\nHere's a screenshot of the interface:\n\n\nA: To open the Terminal with a keyboard shortcut without any third-party software:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator (⌘ + Space, then type Automator)\n\n*Go to File -> New\n\n*Select Quick Action (or Service, depending on your Mac version)\n\n*Where it says Workflow receives, select no input:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Actions column, search for Run AppleScript and drag it to the right column\n\n*Paste this in the script area:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        do script \"\"\n        activate\n    end tell\n\nend run\n\nPS: Remove do script \"\" if you don't want a new instance of the terminal every time you press the hotkey.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on File -> Save and name it anything you want\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now close Automator and open System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts\n\n*In the left column, click on \"Services\"\n\n*Scroll down to the very bottom, you should see the script you just saved. Click on none to assign a hotkey to it.\n\n\nOne important thing to consider, though, is that the hotkey must be unique across all applications. If you assign a common hotkey, such as ⌘ + T, and try to open the terminal while browsing, it will conflict with most browser's hotkey to open a new tab, so it won't work. That's why you should try a shortcut that won't conflict with any app.\nI've chosen ⌘ + ⌥ + F12. Works pretty well.\nUpdate\nIf you're using iTerm2 + Oh My Zsh, just replace Run AppleScript with Launch Application in Automator, and select iTerm.app from the list.\n\nA: I found Apptivate the easiest to use. You just select an application and you assign a global shortcut. That's it.\n\nA: I know Alfred has already been mentioned, but I thought I'd say a little bit about choosing shortcut keys. It was not obvious to me at first what would be a good set of shortcuts that was (a) easy to remember, (b) easy to use, and (c) did not conflict with other system or application shortcut keys.\nI ended up using the \"alt\" key as the basis, and generally relying on keys that can be triggered by the left hand, and choosing descriptive letters (e.g., x for Excel). this allows you to have the mouse in the right hand and the shortcut keys triggered with the left.\nAnother benefit of using Alfred Hotkeys to activate an application is that if an application is hidden, it will be unhidden.\nHere's a screen shot of how I have it configured:\n\n\nA: Thor\nThere is a nice clean open source app for this called Thor. It enabled you to assign global shortcuts to applications.\n\nDownload the binary from the App Store here https://itunes.apple.com/app/thor/id1120999687?ls=1&mt=12.

I use it for heavy nonprofessional office-style work: browsing, email, Word & Pages, Excel, Keynote & Powerpoint, Acrobat Pro, … I tend to have many documents open simultaneously, so I can easily have 20 windows open and ~30 Safari anf Firefox tabs.\nI don't know if my usage is slowly increasing, my expectations growing, or the system aging, but it's gotten to the point where everything feels so slow (notably app-swapping). What measures can I take to improve the responsiveness of the setup? I’d rather not perform invasive hardware changes, so I’m thinking of small small tweaks that could help a bit here and there. And yes, I realize that short of buying a new laptop, there is no silver bullet.\nThings I've already done (and, in some cases, corrected):\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure I have enough disk space for swaping (8 GB free).\n\n*check that I don't have FileVault or encrypted swap.\n\n*check that my usual programs are not running under Rosetta.\n\n*run a cycle of Safe Boot\n\n*I could disable Spotlight altogether, which I suppose would help, but I really use that feature a lot, so I won’t.\nTechnical characteristics:\n\n\n*\n\n*bought April 2007 on French Refurb\n\n*MacBook Pro1,1\n\n*Core Duo 2GHz\n\n*MacBook Pro 15'\n\n*512 MB RAM, upgraded on the first day to 2 GB (= 2 x 1 GB)\n\n*75 GB hard drive\n\n*running up-to-date Leopard (10.5.$latest)\n\n\nA: Well, if it's a MacBookPro3,1 model, then you can upgrade the RAM to it's maximum of 6 Gb. Ram is extremely cheap these days, would be less than a 100$ I imagine.\nAs for hard drives, you could install a 7200 RPM drive (like Western Digital Black series), again cheap, ~100$ for 750 Gb. If you have a bigger budget and no need for such space I strongly suggest installing an SSD drive, at least a 128Gb. This is by far the best upgrade option you can do on your computer. You won't believe the difference in speed! Check out OWC's Mercury extreme 3G's SSDs from Macsales. They are by far the best out there.\nAnd I would install at least OS Snow Leopard, it's pretty solid and fast. Can't say for Lion yet, haven't tested it.\nAs for software there isn't much else you can do. Reinstalling the entire OS from scratch will bring you back to it's original speed but machines tend to slow down over time, this is normal. In my honest opinion, the main problem these days is the hard drives that can't keep up with the rest of the computer. This is why an SSD is a good solution to remedy this problem. And if you buy a bigger version or better yet a SATA3 version of the SSD you could transfer it to any new laptop you might buy in the next 2-3 years, it will be even faster.\n\nA: I would upgrade to Snow Leopard. It's definitely faster. Also, check out this article. Another thing that I have found helps is to restart your Mac into Safe Boot Mode (Startup while holding the shift key; when the gear starts spinning you can let go. It'll take about 7-10 minutes to boot up). Once it's booted up, restart again (without holding any keys down). Here's an Apple doc that explains what Safe Boot Mode does.\n", "Q: Diagnose disk I/O per application I have a Leopard system which feels rather sluggish, and which I suspect may be disk-I/O-bound. While I know how to check which app is using CPU or memory (top or Activity Monitor), I don’t really know how to check which application is heavy on disk-I/O, or if (and how much) swapping occurs on my live system.\nSo, is there any application out there that would monitor and report disk I/O operations for me (in whatever unit is relevant)? Same for swapping: how can I check if (and to what extent) my swap memory is used?\nThis is related to “Give a new life to my 2007 MacBook Pro”\n\nA: The tools are in the terminal app:\n\n\n*\n\n*fs_usage shows the io on a per file instance and grep will help you filter results to one app if desired. \n\n*vm_stat 10 shows aggregate swap activity every 10 seconds - you can fiddle with the timing based on how close you care to look\n\n\nIf you want a nice graph and full monitor, check out Instruments in Xcode. It has amazingly detailed documentation on how to profile, but it basically uses the same terminal commands to get it's raw data but has tons of ways to inspect, view and measure what is happening.

Your internal HD is probably wearing out anyway, so it's not a bad idea to substitute it. If price is an issue you can buy one of the new 7200rpm with 32/64MB of cache, and do a clean install. Before moving your data into the new HD, install your Applications. This way they will reside in area of the disk which can be retrieved faster.\n\n\nA: You can speed up your iMac with CPU&Memory and SSD upgrades.\n\n\n*\n\n*SSD upgrade is cheaper, easier and more efficient overall:\nYou will need an SSD, some patience and skills with screwdriver and this link on how to take apart your iMac (search for 17\" if yours is 17\") and get to HDD. You may also use 2.5\" to 3.5\" bracket for an SSD but it's totally optional.\na. Now you may use your leftover drive by putting it into USB or FireWire 3.5\" external enclosure. I would recommend FireWire 400 (or 800 if you plan to use it later) one if you want best experience, or USB2 if you need cheapest one.\nb. Alternatively (or additionally) you may add any internal 2.5\" SATA HDD in place of optical drive. Here is link on how to replace ODD. You will need a 12.7mm caddy with PATA to SATA converter. If you are going to install OS on it then switch automatic sleep off because it will hang. No problem with using it as a data drive though.\n\n*You may upgrade CPU to 2.33GHz Core 2 Duo T7600 Socket M. Here is ebay listing for them. After this you will be able to upgrade memory to 3GB with a help of this unofficial firmware and additional 2GB SO-DIMM DDR2-667 memory module.

So what I just described still may not solve your problem, but it's worth a shot.\n\nA: Yes, I have the same issue with Chrome or Firefox.

I have Parallels Desktop 6 installed and after an upgrade to Lion I got a whole bunch of Windows app icons on Launchpad:\n\nThey look ugly and don't have a remove button.\nThey also don't exist in my Applications folder so I can't delete them from there either.\nHow do I get rid of them?\n\nA: The original LaunchPad Cleaner would clean up the icons, but running parallels would undo the cleaning. The updated LaunchPad Cleaner V2 corrects that reversion and works to more permanently clean these parallels icons from the LaunchPad view. \nTwo other workarounds options are also available:\n\n\n*\n\n*upgrade to the build that supports Lion, as suggested by patrix (free for v6 users);\n\n*disable Windows application integration by right-clicking Parallels icon in Dock, selecting Configure... for the running machine and unchecking Share Windows applications with Mac in Applications section:\n\nOf course this will also make these shortcuts unavailable on Mac. \n\nA: I had the same issue initially. After upgrading to the latest version of Parallels (which also solved the virtualization issue), all Windows applications were moved to ~/Applications (Parallels) at the first start of Parallels and the icons now don't show up in Launchpad any longer. \n\nA: I had Windows XP installed using Parallels.\nI got rid of the Parallels trial as I bought VMWare instead.\nIn order to clean up my LaunchPad I found that I had to find the following directory: \"Windows XP Applications\" and delete it.\nTo find where the directory was I typed into spotlight \"internet explorer\" without the quotation marks.\nNOTE: To open the containing folder of \"internet explorer\" I held down the Command key and click on \"internet explorer\".\nI then dragged the folder \"Windows XP Applications\" that was containing \"internet explorer\" to the Trash Bin.\nThen I opened a terminal session and typed the following:\nrm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db\nsudo killall Dock\nThat cleaned up my LaunchPad.\nNote it took about 10 to 15 seconds to for LaunchPad reindex the correct applications.\nDoug\n\nA: Launchpad-Control is what you're searching for\nhttp://chaosspace.de/dev/launchpad-control-hide-apps-from-launchpad/\n\nA: To delete for ever, simply go to Finder -> Applications -> My Bootcamp Applications.\nRemove all links in there, and Launchpad will automatically remove them.\nNormally, the links will still come back if you do a refresh reset, but this method should work.\n\nA: I found a way to remove those annoying icons.\nDownload Launchpad Cleaner2. since it's a tryout it lets you only delete the first page and the default icons, like Safari.\nSo what I did was gathered all the Parallels icons into 3 folders and name them Safari2, then Launchpad Cleaner took it as default and I was able to delete them.\n\nA: In your Application directory, there's a folder for virtual machine windows programs (it's hidden, or somehow not easily accesible). You can do a global search for the program name (\"internet explorer\" i.e), and go to the containing folder. Finally, remove the folder entirely. \n", "Q: \"Unable to load the Parallels driver\" after upgrade to Lion I have Parallels Desktop 6 (6.0.11994) installed and after an upgrade to Lion, whenever I start Parallels, I get these two messages:\n\n\nThen Parallels Virtual Machines window appears but neither of them can be started.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: You don't have the Lion compatible version of Parallels installed!

Or can NTFS-3G be somehow modified that it wouldn't need \"the signal\": the partitions work normally until the pop-up.\n\n*Why TrueCrypt drops the partition while normal partitions stay in the system?\n\n*Is some hidden/visible setting in Lion blocking NTFS-3G working normally?\n\n*And finally: Is it just me or does this happen to others with NTFS-3G?\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*TrueCrypt is v. 7.0a\n\n*NTFS-3G is 2010.10.2\n\n*MacFUSE is 2.1.9 (Beta)\n\n\n\nIt seems the problem is indeed with NTFS-3G: I downloaded the trial of Tuxera 2011.4.1 and no errors happened when mounting a NTFS partition with it.\n\nA: I stumbled on a post on IM.GETTING(THIS);, which explained the issue — and even provided a fix!\n\nThe problem seems to stem from the binary \"fuse_wait\" from NTFS-3G that's run as a final part of the mounting procedure - for some reason it can't detect that ntfs-3g mounted the volume and stays on a hopeless loop trying to detect this condition until it gives up after 15 seconds. So my workaround involves replacing the fuse_wait binary with a script that does more or less the same thing, but actually detecting (sort of) the mount operation and not timing out.\n\nThe fix\n(Assuming the use of MacFUSE & NTFS-3G)\nsudo mv /usr/local/bin/fuse_wait /usr/local/bin/fuse_wait.original\nsudo touch /usr/local/bin/fuse_wait\nsudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/fuse_wait\nsudo chown 0:0 /usr/local/bin/fuse_wait\nsudo nano /usr/local/bin/fuse_wait\n\nCopy & paste:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nMNTPOINT=$1\nshift\nTIMEOUT=$1\nshift\nMNTCMD=$1\nshift\n\n$MNTCMD \"$@\" &> /var/log/ntfsmnt.log\nMNTCMD_RETVAL=$?\n\nif [ $MNTCMD_RETVAL -eq 0 ]; then\n        until [ `/sbin/mount | /usr/bin/grep -c \"$MNTPOINT\"` -ge 1 ] || [ $TIMEOUT -eq 0 ]\n        do\n                       sleep 1\n                let TIMEOUT--\n        done\nfi\n\n[ $TIMEOUT -eq 0 ] && RETVAL=1 || RETVAL=$MNTCMD_RETVAL\n\nexit $RETVAL;\n\n\nSave.

If you follow the link everything is explained in details.\n\nA: The same keyboard shortcut for opening Downloads in the Finder works to show and hide the Downloads window within Safari (I'm using 5.1.1).\nThe shortcut is ⌥⌘L\nNote: If you're entering text in a form, open the Downloads window then close it, Safari has trouble returning focus to the form item I was in despite still showing the blue focus ring.\n\nA: If you have Full Keyboard Access Enabled you can press Tab till you arrive on the icon & then press space to view\n", "Q: Anyone know a super easy .mp3 cutter? I am looking for a super easy app for cutting .mp3 files, and setup fadeout at the end. Like Ringer, but this is for ringtones. plus the time is limited and I can't export mp3 files with it. But you get the idea. It's really easy to use. \nAudacity, Garageband are way too complicated and big. Any tips?\n\nA: I know you said that Audacity is too complex, and I agree that the interface is both overwhelming and difficult to figure out.\nThat said, trimming and fading out an audio file in the app is actually very straightforward and you get a lot of additional power that's still easy to use (see the bit I added on normalizing down at the end). Here's my walkthrough:\nOpen the File\n\nSelect the Area to Keep\nJust drag the cursor across the waveform area. Press the spacebar to play/pause, or click the waveform at any spot and press the spacebar to play from there.\n(Instead of selecting the \"keep\" area and trimming you can select the areas to remove and just hid the Delete key.)\n\nSelect Trim from the Edit Menu\nOr press CmdT\n\nThe trimmed file:\n\nSelect the Area to Fade\n\nSelect Fade from the Effects Menu\n\n\nThe now-faded result:\n\nExport as MP3\n\n\nChoose mp3:\n\nEdit or enter file metadata:\n\nDone!\n\nNormalizing the Audio\nBecause you're in a more powerful editing app, you could also take a moment to Normalize the file. This brings the audio levels up to \"full\", meaning the file is as loud as it can be without clipping or distorting anything. \nNormalizing is generally great for podcasts and other spoken tracks, though isn't always recommended for music (sometimes the fact that it's quiet is intentional).\nHere's how to normalize it while it's still open:\nSelect the Track\nCmdA for Select All is quick, or just double-click the waveform area.\n\nChoose Normalize from the Effects Menu\n\n\nUse the default settings:\n\nThe resulting normalized audio:\n\n\nA: You can trim it in iTunes, albeit not quite as graphically as other programs. \n\n\n*\n\n*Click to select the MP3 file in iTunes\n\n*File → Get Info (or Cmd-I)\n\n*\"Options\" tab\n\n*Choose the Start Time and End Time -- you may need to test this out a few times\n\n*Advanced → Create MP3/AAC version\n\n\n(For Step 5, whether it's MP3 or AAC depends on your import settings.

I installed Lion on a new disk today and let the migration assistant move users, applications and stuff from my internal disk to the SSD connected via FW800. So far everything works great. \nBecause I have a pretty large photos and audio library, I want to leave my user's home directory on the old Volume and have OS and Applications on the other disk.\nTo achieve this I opened up Terminal.app, sudo'd and entered the following command:\n\ncd /Users\nmv mwidmann mwidmann_\nln -s /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/mwidmann .\nchown -R mwidmann:mwidmann mwidmann\n\nSo far so good.\nIn finder the home folder was replaced with mwidmann_, but I removed that item from the sidebar and added the new one instead. Same goes for documents, downloads, pictures, videos, music. Other items I added there, worked like before.\nWhy I feel that I'm missing something is because the nice sidebar and dock icons for these \"special\" folders aren't showing up. \nThere must be an additional thing that tells Lion that THIS is my home folder and it is in /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/mwidmann and nowhere else.\nAny Ideas?\n\nA: You could also go System Preferences > Users & Group, right click on your username, click Advanced Options, and set the path of your Home directory. I also feel it's a more \"robust\" solution, because it's \"endorsed\" by Apple.\n\nA: Nevermind, I found the solution!\nI had to restart the computer and re-set the shortcuts and now it's working like I want it to. All the icons are showing up like I wanted.\nSo it really seems to be enough to just move the folder, set a link, set the correct permissions and that's it.\n", "Q: iPhone 3G camera doesn't work My iPhone's camera stopped working. App opens but the shutter never opens. It holds still forever. It just came suddenly without any warning.\nMy iPhone was Jailbroken and I thought it was something to do with that (though it didn't make any sense as I had it Jailbroken for a couple of years now). So I installed the iOS from scratch (restore) without Jailbreaking it. Restored the backup. Camera worked... for a day.\nStopped working again. I tried Camera+ - no luck either, freezes on the \"autofocus\" rectangle.\nWhat's happening and how to get it to work again?\nI'm fine with Jailbreaking it again if there's any point (like need to access system files...).\n\nA: Based on a research I did on the Internet it seems that the reason for this malfunction could be the sensor (whatever that means). With new phones this usually means warranty replacement. My phone is a bit too old for that unfortunately, but... I accidentally found a workaround!\nCovering completely the camera lens with a finger when opening the Camera app seems to solve the problem! Covering the lens when the Camera app is already opened doesn't cause shutter to open though so the lens has to be covered prior to Camera app launch.\n", "Q: How can I enable a notification that a pop-up has been blocked in Safari?

I'm trying to get my host machine running Lion to automount an NFS export on my CentOS VM.\nI was able to get this working on a system running Mac OS 10.5 by modifying /etc/auto_master and then restarting the autofs service per the instructions in http://alanlam.blogspot.com/2008/06/restart-autofs-in-leopard-without.html:\n\n\nsudo service com.apple.autofsd stop\nsudo service com.apple.autofsd start\n\n\nHowever, in Lion, the service command appears to be missing.\nHow do I reload the autofs service in OS X Lion without restarting?\n\nA: You can use launchctl instead of service:\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.autofsd\n\nYou should not need to restart autofsdt manually; launchd will notice that it has stopped, and immediately start another instance.\n\nA: this works for me:\nsudo automount -vc\n\n", "Q: Dock in Lion FullScreen I would like to know if there is a way to have the dock always there when running an App fullscreen in lion?\n\nA: It is very unlikely that Apple will ever support this request officially, as it would go against their whole \"full-screen\" philosophy. However, it ought to be possible to create a SIMBL hack which achieves it.\nIf you do want the dock visible when using an app - perhaps the best solution is not to use fullscreen, but simply make the app window large by using the green traffic light button or dragging the edges.\n", "Q: Two drobo NAS on one network causes premature  'Server has closed down' events.  We have a Drobo setup with a fixed IP on ethernet which we've named BoxA. It shows up in the finder list, everyone can connect to it and share files.\nWe brought a second Drobo to backup the first, this was given a different fixed ip and a different name BoxB.  \nWhen we connect BoxB to the network all the clients which are connected to BoxA receive the message \"BoxA has closed down\" clicking on BoxA on the finder reveals the content of BoxB.\nAny idea what might be causing Finder to display this message? Why would it see two different network servers as the same?\n\nA: Have you tried placing each in it's own NetBIOS Domain Name to keep them from chatting/colliding on a shared port or name?\n\nA: It turns out that along with the real static IP that is set in the Drobo Dasbhoard each Drobo was assigned a local link address. After some digging around in the firmware I found that both Drobo's were just binding themselves to: 169.254.213.234 without checking if another device was using this address.\nThis is why Finder was showing DroboA as DroboB as it was using the local link address to resolve the DroboA.local address. \nIf you install Drobo Apps and Dropbear you can SSH into the device and adjust the address used, these changes probably won't stick around after a firmware update but you need to adjust the IP in following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/init.d/net_config\n\n*/etc/udcpc.sh\n\n\nNow DroboA is bound to 169.254.213.234 and DroboB is bound to 169.254.213.233 both appear as separate entries in the finder and work as I first expected. I've filed a bug with Drobo as I don't see why it should assign an IP without first checking if it already exists.\n", "Q: Does the oleophobic effect of the iPhone screen wear off over time? Unlike predecessors, the iPhone 4 has a screen that is more resistant to smears and smudges. \nIs this a property of the glass itself, or is it a coating that will wear off over time? If it wears off, how long does that take?\nUpdate: Some answers address cleaning the screen. I've never cleaned by phone except by wiping it across my shirt or pants-leg.\n\nA: I've had an iPhone 4 since the day it came out. After the first year or so the oleophobic property has completely gone: it's now no different to my old iPhone 3G screen in terms of finger smears. I've never cleaned it with any sort of chemical agent but I've also never kept it in a case that covers the screen, and it spends a lot of time in my jeans pocket. So the answer is yes, under some conditions it certainly does wear off over time. Your mileage may vary, of course: kept in a case, or carried in a bag or purse where the screen doesn't get rubbed, it should last much longer.\n\nA: Unfortunately, yes, the coating does wear off over time. Apple has this to say:\n\nPlease note that the ability of this coating to repel oil will\n  diminish over time with normal usage, and that rubbing the screen with\n  an abrasive material will further diminish its effect and may scratch\n  your screen. —Apple\n\nHowever, and this is good news, there are aftermarket alternatives to re-apply an oleophobic coating. Aculon is in the business of applying lipophobic protection (among other types) to a range of devices. I'm not sure how well they work or how much they run but a solution does indeed exist.\nAnd for the curious bunch among you, here's what Bill Nye (The Science Guy) says on how the substance works:\n\nThe new 3GS iPhone has a coating that helps you leave no, well hardly\n  any, prints—fingerprints. The glass screen is coated with a polymer,\n  a plastic that human skin oil doesn't adhere to very well. People in\n  the chemical bonding business like to call the finished surface\n  \"oleophobic.\"\nSuch a lovely Greek cognate may sound like it means \"afraid of oil.\"\n  And, it does, but it also connotes (or carries with) \"aversion\" or\n  \"not-like-to-be-around-tivity,\" if I may. Instead of sticking to the\n  bonded-plastic surface of your new phone, the oil from you fingers or\n  cheekbone or tip of your nose stays more or less together as its own\n  smooshed droplet.\nThe Applers were able to do this by bonding this oleophobic polymer to\n  glass. The polymer is an organic (from organisms) compound,\n  carbon-based. The glass is nominally inorganic, silicon-based… solid\n  rock. The trick is getting the one to stick to the other. Although it\n  is nominally proprietary, this is probably done with a third molecule\n  that sticks to silicon on one side and to carbon-based polymers on the\n  other side. Chemical engineers get it to stay stuck by inducing\n  compounds to diffuse or \"inter-penetrate\" into the polymer. The\n  intermediate chemical is a \"silane,\" a molecule that has silicon and\n  alkanes (chains of carbon atoms).\nIf you'd like—and I hope you will—take a moment and think about\n  droplets, like water droplets, on a surface. Deep in the droplet,\n  water molecules stick to each other. On the surface though, they stick\n  to each other as well, but they also have to opportunity to stick or\n  not to stick to the surface they're resting on. When they stick, say\n  to the nylon fibers in a bikini strap, the swimsuit feels wet (or so\n  I'm told). When they don't stick to the surface they're resting on,\n  they bead up, like in the car wax commercials.\nWell, the polymer that the 3GS iPhone screen is coated with doesn't\n  let the oil of your skin stick to it very much. So, you don't leave\n  fingerprints. The key is in the intermediate compounds, the silanes\n  that hold the plastic to the glass.\nSo grab a hold of one, and for a change, watch almost nothing happen.\n  It's chemistry. —Gizmodo\n\n\nA: I have owned an iPhone 3GS for one whole year and then an iPhone 4 for a year and a half. In both cases, the oleophobic coating has never rubbed off, and I use my iPhones a lot!\nI would say that this coating is very well bonded to the glass.\n\nA: It depends if you clean the screen of the phone with strong alcoholic solutions. Some alcoholic solutions wear off the Oleo-phobic coating.\n\nA: As they say, your mileage may vary. I would say that it all depends on the cleaning solution you use. \nI had an iPhone 3G that I used for quite some time and cleaned regularly with the cleaning kit by iClear (The only one that Apple sells at its stores). I cleaned the iPhone about once a week and it kept the screen in excellent condition. \nFor my iPhone 4, I have been using the cleaning kit by Monster sold at Best Buy (also weekly) and it has not kept my phone as well as the cleaning kit by iClear. This tells me that the oleophobic coating may actually diminish over time with the wrong cleaning solution. \nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Mac Pro: Any way to recognize a bootable USB on startup? I have a Mac Pro 2,1 2x6-Core Xeon@2.66 GHz and am trying to boot from several ISO images written to USB sticks. I have tried the dd-based methods as recommended by Ubuntu, with no luck. In every case the stick fails to be recognized at boot time. I have also tried booting from a rEFIt CD (which I can do) but the loader there doesn't identify the USB stick in the front of the machine.\nIs it possible the MacBooks are so different from the Mac Pros that these instructions wouldn't apply? Does anyone have a reproducible method for creation bootable USB sticks on a Mac Pro and then booting from them?\n\nA: I don't know much about booting Linux on a Mac, but you should be able to start up with the option key. It may take awhile to start up, but you should get a screen that allows you to choose what disk to boot from. Hope that helps! \nEDIT: Check out this Apple Support Doc here.\n\nA: If your volume isn't showing in the Startup Manager but is showing in the startup disk preference pane, then it's likely the image just needs a Folder Mode bless.\nThis will modify that filesystem on the USB drive to ensure that other macs see it as ready to go when booting with option pressed to get to the startup manager.\n", "Q: Open Self Extracting .exe I have a self extracting exe file that is password protected, does anybody know of a program that will open this? If I need to I can just run bootcamp, but it would be convenient to not have to do this.\n\nA: Some self-extracting files can also just by unzipped using the command line 'unzip'. Just open Terminal, change into the directory with the .exe, and try running unzip -t filename.exe. You should see a listing of the files in the .exe. If you don't, then this approach won't work. If you do, you can make a directory and then extract the files, something like mkdir extracted && unzip /path/to/file.exe\n\nA: Ok, this is how I solved the problem. Following bmike's advice, I went to the App Store, searched for and installed Stuffit. When you open Stuffit, it opens for you a target where you can drag and drop the file compressed as a Windows executable. At least for the file that I've got, that pretty much did the trick.\n", "Q: X-Mailer header mapping to actual version of mail.app used to send message When email is sent using Mail.app a Apple Mail (x.xxx.x) X-Mailer header is added to the message.

I then proceeded trying to open any folder with quicksilver and spotlight to no avail.

However, setting the script up to run via the Finder is even more complicated still.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a simple shell script, like your example I've made a Hello World application:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hello World\"\n\n\n\n*Save this file as HelloWorld.command.\n\n*Give this file permission to be executed. chmod u+x HelloWorld.command should do that.\n\n*Open the directory where you saved this file in Finder. Then double click on the HelloWorld.command file.\nThis will open up a terminal and execute the script, the output on my computer is the following:\n\n$ /Users/jason/Applications/HelloWorld.command ; exit;\n  Hello World\n  logout  \n[Process completed]\n\nThe alternative way of executing this file is while still in the Terminal yourself, simply issue ./HelloWorld.command assuming you're in the same directory as the file.\nDoing so will result in much simpler output:\n\njason-mac Applications $ ./HelloWorld.command\n  Hello World\n  jason-mac Applications $\n\nYou've just created and executed a shell script in OS X!\n\nA: You probably want to give AppleScript a look. This book by Sal Soghoian is considered by many the go-to book on AppleScript. \nAnother nice way for users to automate Mac apps is using Automator. You may want to give it a try as well. Hope this helps. \nUpdate\nIt seems that you're looking for something like Unix shell scripting. This two tutorials are decent and seem to cover the basics. \n\nA: Shell scripts. I don't think Ask Different would be the suitable place to discuss it in depth but there's a very detailed guide here:\nhttp://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html\nMac OS X is UNIX Certified from 10.5 on (right?) so this wisdom here is also applicable to Linux and other UNIX-like OSs.\n(in a less complex way, Mac OS X's Automator is pretty damn powerful, as is the AppleScript Editor, both of which can execute shell scripts and other commands with programs, and wrap them up into a convenient .app bundle for Launchpad or sharing with friends)\n\nA: For mac is the .sh file aka Shell script\n\nA: I made a video a couple of days ago explaining this. Hope this helps: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2jxpJAlsyg\n", "Q: Can I make the mouse hairpin in the terminal more visible? It often takes me a while to find the mouse crosshair when working with Terminal.app. Is there a way to make it more visible?\n\nA: There's an app available to download called Mouse Locator which will put green markers around your cursor if you press a hotkey.  That might help you but I don't know if it's still a working program under current OS X releases.\n\nA: I've started having this problem also, not sure if it started happening after i got a retina screen or upgraded to mavericks, or im just getting old. My suggestion is to try iTerm2 which have a bit more visible \"hairpin\".\n\nA: If you mean the blinking cursor, then you need to go into the terminal preferences.

I've added special characters that I frequently use to my favorites, but I'd like to group them more logically than simply the order in which I \"favorite\" them.  Is this possible?\n\n\nA: Yes - they are drag and drop in the palette itself on Lion (so that's the easiest for me to get them in order).\nIf that doesn't work for you, you can also edit the plist when the Special Characters picker isn't running.\nThe favorites are (hopefully for your OS level) stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.CharacterPaletteIM.plist\n\nIf your editor lets you drag \"Item 2\" up to \"CVFavorites\" it will be the new first item. You can open the triangles to see what the favorites are and reorder them fairly painlessly and then save your work.\n\nA: Snow Leopard\nFor Snow Leopard, the only way (AFAIK) to re-order favorites characters is to make it in the plist file located in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.CharacterPaletteIM.plist\nAs you can see on the screenshot below, there's an array called \"CharPaletteFavorites\" containing multiple dictionaries (one by character). Just re-order them when the character palette is closed, save and that's it !\nTo open the plist, you can use Xcode or any text editor as it is basically XML.\n\n(It is the same solution as posted by bmike, but for Snow Leopard. The only difference is the name of the array containing special chars.)\n", "Q: Can Finder and the \"open\" command treat files with .sh or other typical extensions just like .command files? I am looking for a way to inject some more extensions into the OS X launch services database systematically so that when clicked, they execute in the terminal app just like .command files do by default.\nThings like .ksh, .sh, and .csh would be nice to start, but I assume once I figure out how to add one, it's easy to do the rest.\nAn answer specific to Lion or Snow Leopard is fine, so a general-case answer for all OS versions is not necessary. It would be great if this were scriptable and wrote directly to the Launch Services database so I could automate this rather than going to finder on each mac and doing a lot of clicking.\n\nA: If a file is opened with Terminal, and has the execute bit set, then Terminal will execute it.\nGet Info on a .sh file and set it to be opened with Terminal, and click the Change All button.\n\nA: To prefer Terminal to open .sh files — using the defaults command, without using Finder\nIn most cases, all that's required should be possible from the command line …\nPreparation\nTwo commands: \ndefaults read com.apple.LaunchServices | grep -B 1 -A 3 public.shell-script\ndefaults read com.apple.LaunchServices | grep -B 1 -A 4 \"LSHandlerContentTag = sh;\"\nIf either command reveals an existing preference\nUse Xcode or any other suitable property list editor to remove the relevant dictionary from the LSHandlers key within the following file: \n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist\nHints: \n\n\n*\n\n*defaults, with which I'm more familiar, seems unsuitable for removal of a single dictionary from an array\n\n*removal should be necessary only if (say) the user has previously used Finder to associate .sh files with an application other than the system default\n\n*a Super User answer under How to change default app for all files of particular file type through terminal in OS X? is recently edited to include a script that uses PlistBuddy — credit to Daniel Beck.\n\n\n\nAdding to LaunchServices preferences, for Terminal to view and edit .sh files\nTwo one-line commands. \nDepending on your requirements, the first command alone may suffice: \ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{ LSHandlerContentType = \"public.shell-script\"; LSHandlerRoleViewer = \"com.apple.Terminal\"; LSHandlerRoleEditor = \"com.apple.Terminal\"; }'\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{ LSHandlerContentTag = \"sh\"; LSHandlerContentTagClass = \"public.filename-extension\"; LSHandlerRoleViewer = \"com.apple.Terminal\"; LSHandlerRoleEditor = \"com.apple.Terminal\"; }'\nFor the new preferences to be respected\nModifications to the user domain persistence layer of Launch Services must be acknowledged.

Best as in easiest to install, maintain, upgrade etc.\nAs I understand it, there are some alternatives: macports, homebrew etc. Or in the GIT example, maybe just download the installer from their website.\nThanks.\n\nA: Git's bundled with the free version of Xcode 4 on the app store. That's about as easy and official as it gets in my book. You won't do wrong by choosing homebrew as it's solid and got great momentum plus mindshare presently.\n\nA: I think it depends on how many tools/libraries you need to install. \nIf just git then use Xcode 4 which you will need for any port package. If you are doing pure HTML/Javascripy/CSS then the git installer will work. \nFor python and perl and similar interpreters the the language install tools can be used unless there are complex C/C++ libraries\nIf only a few others then build into /usr/local\nHowever if you have several things to install or there are complex dependencies then I would use a ports package like Fink, macports or homebrew (which is best is debatable and should be a separate discussion)\n\nA: If it's just git then, by all means, their installation procedure works well. But you know it won't stay like that.\nI really prefer homebrew over macports. I brew everyday =) It's super easy to install: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation\nAnd it hasn't bitten me yet. Their non-sudo approach rocks.

Where does OS X store your current desktop picture? I read somewhere else that it was in /Library/Caches/com.apple.Desktop. But I don't have that directory.\n\nA: Starting in Lion, I don't think Lion caches desktop pictures anymore (possibly because you can have multiple at a time, for different desktops/spaces).\nIn that case, use plutil -p to dump the binary plist file in text form using terminal:\n plutil -p ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist\n\nThe Apple delivered desktop images are stored in /Library/Desktop Pictures , so you can eliminate those (or seek those if you used an Apple picture for one or more spaces). Before Lion, the preference file that controls desktop images is text format any to find out the current image, open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist in a text editor and find the first ImageFilePath property. That will tell you the path to the current desktop image.\n\nA: If you just go into system preference, then desktop. you can simple click and drag the little image you have onto your desktop. \n\nA: As of Catalina (MacOS 10.15.5) and Big Sur (MacOS 11.2), I can verify that this is now the location of the desktop background images.\nSystem/Library/Desktop Pictures\nIf you want to navigate to it, you can press command K and paste the text below in.\nfile://System/Library/Desktop%20Pictures\n1.4 GB too. : [\nYou'll need to turn off System Integrity if you wish to give write privs to that folder so that you can remove any of these images.\n\nA: In current versions of macOS (at least in Mojave, probably since Sierra, not sure about others) the location of the desktop pictures are stored in a SQLite database located at ~/Library/Application Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db.\nI did not dig into details of the database structure but you can get the file path with this command:\nsqlite3 -readonly ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db \\\n    'SELECT * FROM data ORDER BY rowID DESC LIMIT 1;'\n\n\nA: It does allow you to retrieve the image if that is what you want.

So a friend just gave me his Macbook Air 1,1 on which he spilt some water. He wiped it away immediately, turned it off and upside down but alas the \"l\" key is no longer functional. However all the others are. \nPRAM reset, no luck. Lifted keycap off, nothing unusual visible but still doesn't work. I'm going to leave it off and evaporating for a little while to see if that changes anything, but any suggestions would be great.\nIncidentally, he also is still covered under Applecare. Can we get away with a repair on this? There's no water damage marker is there?\n\nA: Apple are very likely to repair this under Applecare with no charge. I have had several defective keyboards and stuck keys in the past. In all cases, Apple replaced the keyboards for free under Applecare. \nClearly your milage will vary, since if you have damaged the keyboard by misuse they are under no obligation to fix it, but in my experience, Genius bar engineers will always give you the benefit of the doubt.\n\nA: There are LCI (Liquid Contact Indicators) on the topcase/keyboard of the MacBook Air which are quite sparsely placed. If these are tripped Apple will nearly always decline a repair, especially if the faulty module is the one with tripped LCI's. There's also a chance that there will be signs of liquid ingress on the underside of the keyboard.\nParts with tripped LCI's will not be covered by warranty until replaced.\nHowever, there's a good chance that there won't be any sign of liquid damage. Plus Apple tend to be super nice to their AppleCare customers, so it's worth a punt.\nThe important thing is to deny all knowledge of a spillage\n\nA: The best method is to take it to someone that knows how to repair keys on the mac. Repair shops generally have spares of the delicate scissors and keys (as they can break on removal) and they will need to remove the key cap to investigate whether the spill was related.\nIf the sensor contact that lies under the I key is shorted (while wet), you can expect a recovery, but that the liquid will be corroding things.\nIf the mac is totally dry and still not working, the electronics may need to be repaired.\nRepair techs see this hundreds of times in a year - it's not so scary to them, so take it in and ask realistically how the repair would go. If things are corroded, going in to move parts might result in a non functioning machine - so it's a gamble based on exactly what liquid, where it went, how fast it dried and plain old fashioned luck.\nHopefully it's a piece of lint or something preventing the switch so learn how that key comes off and see for yourself or take it in if there are convenient repair options.\n\nA: Or.... Your could take responsibility for yourself. Take it in and tell them that you spilled water on it and ask if there is anything they can do. They may be able to work out something with you. I would like to see your face when they take it apart and show you the LCI evidence of water spillage and see how they treat you then. Sorry to be anecdotal here, but my wife dropped her 2 week old iPhone4 in a full cup of decaf coffee. She took it into Apple to get a new phone, completely expecting to have to buy new one.

Do I need the Install Xcode after Xcode is installed?\nDo you know of any reason it installed an installer to Applications?\n\nA: You may want to keep it in order to be able to download delta updates instead of the full version when updating via the Mac App Store.\nIf you don't care about that or care more about disk space, you can delete it (you'll be asked for the administrator password) and continue to use Xcode.\n\nA: It's not necessary to keep the XCode installer file after XCode is installed. However, you may wish to consider keeping it stored somewhere as the XCode download is relatively large. \nIt's probably in the Applications folder because this is where the App Store puts downloaded packages by default.\n\nA: The Mac App Store is setup to install in /Applications, but some applications, like Xcode, are way more complicated to be contained in an .app file.\nSo they need to use an installer, which is going to add the /Developer folder which itself contains multiple applications (Xcode, Dashcode, the iOS simulator, etc.).\n\nA: I found the App Store download put an xcode installer into /Applications.

It's where developers can file bug reports/feature requests/enhancements, etc. You do need to sign up for a free developer account to be able to submit bugs, though you don't necessarily need to know how to develop apps for OS X.\nWhen you submit a bug through the feedback form, it's possible that someone at Apple will manually create a corresponding bug in the bug reporter system, but there's no guarantee.\nBugs submitted through the bug reporter (often referred to by its code name Radar) all have an official number and status (open or closed) that you can track.\nCompared to the feedback form, the bug reporter can potentially offer more in the way of feedback from Apple about the bug's status: Open, Insufficient Information, Duplicate, 3rd Party to Resolve, Behaves Correctly, and Closed.\n\nA: *\n\n*E-mail Steve Jobs directly for feature requests\n\n*Look at this question for enabling Screen Zoom in lion\n\nA: Here's the official Feedback form for OS X.\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\nThe general feedback pages do get to the marketing and engineering people as well as measuring user satisfaction, but you also can sign up for a free developer account and file bugs more directly with the engineering team. It's best to reserve this for real bugs, but it's also appropriate to make usability / functional requests there too.\nhttp://bugreporter.apple.com\nYour issue where you can repeatably break a known function is clearly a bug and might get resolved much faster through the bug channel. You can upload specifics of your hardware and steps to reproduce and honest bugs get resolved quite efficiently through this channel.\n\nA: Me too I use a lot the screen zooming and I'm quite annoyed by this small bug.\nIn addition to the solutions already provided, I've found out that playing a bit with \"System preferences\" -> \"Universal Access\" solves the problem (until it appears next time).\nFrom this screen, after playing a bit with the options about Zooming and testing with ctrl-2fingers, I get the feature back, then it doesn't really matter if I set the zoom on or of: it keeps working.\nThis behavior is quite odd indeed, but at least I don't have to restart services or reboot.\n\nA: Note that there is also the OpenRadar project to bring these reports out into the open, but it could use a lot of work.\n", "Q: TimeMachine and an External HFS + NTFS HDD Can I partition my external HDD into 2 HFS + NTFS? and use HFS+ partition for TimeMachine backup. I already lost my info once in this way, this is why I have to ask now, before doing some stupid things again. The NTFS partition is for Ubuntu and Windows machine from my office, at home I am using 10.6.8\n\nA: Time Machine needs a mountable HFS+ partition; it couldn't care less how large that partition is relative to the overall size of the drive.\nBut I agree with Gio's comment; drives are cheap, so I'd suggest getting multiple drives.  \n", "Q: Is there a way to upload a video from my iPhone to Google+? is there a way to upload video from iphone to Google+?\nFrom iphone Google+ app we can upload photos but Video option is only available for Android yet\n\nA: No, there's no way to do that yet.

I have OS X Lion and when I open a finder window everything seems OK.\nBut I can't see the Path Bar nor the Status bar.\nWhen I activate one of the bars with View->Show Status Bar or View->Show Path Bar the Finder window gets bigger in height ( growing downwards ), nothing else happens.\nAnyone have an idea what I can do to see the Bars?\n(The Bars are working in other applications like Safari, ⌘+/ and it pops up)\n\nA: Is it just this you are looking for? Finder > View > Show Path Bar?\nAlso here: http://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/findertip1.htm\n\nA: The bug did come from BetterSnapTool. An app for resizing the windows.\n\nA: Remove the Finder plist. You can find it at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist.\nThen restart.

I have the possibility to buy an iPad 2 3G which is written iPad \"UK\", on the vendor's site. I expect it to have a different charger plug, but that's all.\nBeing in Poland, will I be able to make it work with 3G cards from Poland?\nThe broader question is to know if there is a country limitation, or a difference of norms in the 3G matter for the iPad 2.\n\nA: It's not locked to any one carrier so you should be able to insert a Micro SIM card for your local carrier and it will work.\nThe catch is that there are different sets of GSM frequencies in use, so you should verify that your chosen carrier uses frequencies supported by the iPad.  Odds are it will work, but better to be safe.\nFrom the specs page, here is what it supports:\n\nUMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800,\n  1900 MHz)\n\nThe broader situation is that the only problematic (less interoperable) 3G iPad is the Verizon-specific model sold in the USA \n", "Q: How do I open a file as root in TextEdit on Lion? How do I open a file as root, in TextEdit? I've tried these commands as root, but TextEdit always say it's locked:\nopen -e /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\nopen -e -F /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\nopen -e -F -W /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nAnd of course sudo !! makes no difference.\n\nA: BBEdit is the free tool to do this in 2019 and it replaces all functionality of TextErangler and you can download it from the App Store and the developer web site. \n\nTextEdit isn't really the right tool for editing config files -- use TextWrangler instead.  It's free, has built-in capability to edit files with root access from an admin account, as well as things like opening invisible files and directories easily editing files over SFTP, etc.\n\nA: Here's a way to avoid running TextEdit as root:\nEDITOR='open -Wne' sudo -e /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nYou will need to quit the copy of TextEdit after editing the file.\nsudo -e, sometimes known as sudoedit but not on OS X, makes a temporary copy of the file with write permission for the current user, invokes an editor on it in the usual Unix fashion, and then copies it back.\nThe options to open: -W waits for TextEdit to quit, so sudo knows when to copy the file back. -n ensures that it's waiting on a separate instance of TextEdit, not one you already have open which you might not want to quit. You can also substitute -t instead of -e if you have a favorite text editor other than TextEdit.\nIf you already have an EDITOR variable set to use a graphical editor with its own wait-capable command line tool (such as TextMate or BBEdit), then you don't need any of these tricks and can just use sudo -e <file> directly.\n\nA: Since the root user is disabled, the only way to force an arbitrary OS X app to have root permissions is to enable root and log in as root.\nApps can of course use API to ask the system for authentication and pop up the dialog you expect when asked for an administrator user and password. TextEdit doesn't have that function so you have to work around the file permissions before and after you open and write the files desired. \nHave you tried using sudo open -a textedit to open the app?\n\nA: sudo chmod +w name_of_the_file\nsudo open -a TextEdit name_of_the_file\nsudo chmod -w name_of_the_file\n\nShould work\n\nA: You can open up a textedit instance as root by entering the full path to the actual executable :\nsudo -b \"/Applications/Textedit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit\"\n\nOnce your root instance is open you could browse to the file you need or do this from the command line :\nsudo su - root -c \"open -e /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\"\n\n\nA: sudo nano /etc/hosts \n\nworks for Lion\n", "Q: iPhone 4 no longer detects SIM card, how can I fix it? Since 3 months I do have an iPhone 4, 3 weeks ago i started to get no SIM card installed error increasingly more frequent. Right now the phone is unusable. I went to a sales office of my mobile supplier, they tried a different sim card. But this did not solve the issue unfortunately. \nThey want it now for reparation, which means i loose my iphone for 2 or 3 weeks. Are there any other possibilities, on the internet I read a few sites which speak about sticky tape or applying some glue to the simcard slider. But I don't want to run the risk of losing my warranty and ruining the iphone's interior.\nI have the feeling that the problem is only at the slider, so I'm a kind of dissatisfied with the iphone being taken in 2 weeks for service.\nAre there any other options?\n\nA: Take it to the Apple store if there is one near you. Usually they will switch out the phone if still under warranty. \n\nA: Where do you live? \nMost Apple stores will exchange the device while you wait. Mail in service is similarly one day upon receipt - so anyone quoting 2 weeks is either being really cautious and not using express shipping or expects to send it to a shop that will try to repair the insides rather than swapping it as Apple does. \nI would contact Apple directly at http://www.apple.com/support/country/index.html?dest=applecare and ask for a quote before waiting 2-3 weeks.\n", "Q: Safari bookmarks keep disappearing MBP \"13, 10.7 and Safari 5.1\nI've noticed something weird: last week, I added a couple of bookmarks to my bookmarks-bar in Safari and the next day (or the next reboot) they weren't there anymore...\nAdded them again and the same thing happened...\nI've disabled bookmark syncing in the \"Mail, Contacts, Calendar\" settings but the same problem still occurs...\nAny ideas how I can further troubleshoot this?\n\nA: If the bookmarks are not saving this may be a permissions issue. \nSafari stores its bookmarks in ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist\nIf this file cannot be updated (i.e. if permissions are wrong), then the bookmarks won't be saved.\nCheck the datestamp on this file. It should be updated every time you add a bookmark. If it isn't, then this is likely the cause of the problem.\nTo fix it, you need to fix the permissions. Try Repair Permissions in Disk Utility. If that doesn't work, try the following:\n1) Delete that file while Safari is running - then go into Safari and add a new bookmark. This will create a new bookmark file with all your bookmarks.\nIf you delete the file while safari is not running you lose all your bookmarks - so make a back up of the file. The safest thing is to rename it.\n", "Q: Best approach to offsite backups with Time Machine and USB Disks What is the best approach to using multiple USB disks and Time Machine to achieve a backup methodology with one drive being used for current backups and one stored offsite and updated periodically?\nI've considered swapping the disks periodically but that would mean that the drive that comes \"in\" from being offsite would be missing incremental backups for whatever period it was offsite.\nIs it better to simply backup to one disk and periodically clone it to the disk that is going offsite?  That seems simple but creates a window during which both disks are onsite.\n\nA: I have thought about that same problem for quite some time now. With online backups, large amounts of files are slow to upload and inconvenient to download; so I really like the two physical USB drives approach. Having both disks onsite while you clone the most recent disk is not as bad as long as you limit the time you use for this. Don't do it over a week, for instance. Get it cloned and offsite ASAP. \nHaving said all of that, my answer to your question is to use something like a Drobo. I haven't done it yet, but Drobo seems like it fits the bill: The Mac will see it as one big Time Machine volume, but in reality you are mirroring multiple disks at the same time. If price is not an issue, and you don't mind handling SATA drives around (You can get an enclosure for the one that will be traveling offsite) it may be something to look into. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: Look into Carbonite. It's $59/year per computer and it backs up your computer automatically in the background. If your Mac crashes, it'll restore the files back on your hard drive where they were.\n\nA: You can use time machine on your main drive, and the use Carbon Copy Cloner to make an exact copy of your offsite drive. You can make as many as you want, and update it periodically.\n\nA: I have used two TM disks for offsite backups quite a lot with good results.  The key thing to keep in mind is that the longer you take to rotate disks, the worse off you will be if disaster happens.\nThis is my strategy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get two or more drives for Time Machine (TM)\n\n*Set up all drives for TM and perform the first backup on each\n\n*** Encrypt the backups **. This is very important if you feel there is even a slight chance of someone gaining physical access.\n\n*Take one drive off-site.  I took the disk to my office when I had to commute.\n\n*Continue the TM backup process on the other disk\n\n*When you plan to do the swap, take the recent TM copy from your home to your work.  ** Do not do it the other way around, as this creates a window where disaster can occur, wiping out all of your backups. **\n\n*Take the older disk from work to home\n\n*Plug in the older disk and it will resume where it left off.\n\n*On the next rotation, repeat steps 4-8\n\n\nI did my swaps once a week, so a worst case scenario is that I would loose a weeks worth of data.\n", "Q: Can not set startup disk At System Preferences > Startup Disk I select a disk with Mac OS X (10.5 or 10.6) installed, but when I click Restart I get this error message: You can’t change the startup disk to the selected disk. The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk.\nI have 10.6 installed on an internal hard drive and 10.5 on an external drive.\nI have completely erased both disks from Disk Utility; done Verify Disk, Repair Disk, Verify Disk Permissions, Repair Disk Permissions; reinstalled Mac OS several times on both drives...\nUpdate:\nLooks like something is wrong with internal hdd. I have tried to restart the machine in target disk mode, but I got You can't start up with target disk mode. The nvram tool was unable to set a preference\n\nA: From the errors given, it sounds like it's more about setting the NVRAM than the startup disk itself.  Clear the NVRAM (previously referred to as PRAM; reboot holding command-option-P-R until you hear a second chime) and see if the problem works itself out.\n\nA: *\n\n*Are you sure your volume has a valid bootable image? That will cause bless to fail - you may have to run the bless command in the terminal or look at the logs to discover this error.\n\n*What is the partition map on the drives set to? Disk Utility will give you three options: Apple Partition Map, GUID, and Master Boot Record. For any relatively recent Mac, you should always choose GUID. For PowerPC Macs, choose APM. If your disk is MBR, you will not be able to boot OS X from it.\nWhen in doubt, these days, choose GUID. To change the partition map, you'll have to reformat the whole disk (including wiping all partitions). \n", "Q: Choosing work or home contact info to autofill Pages template Certain templates in Pages '09 autofill using my work contact information, e.g., San Francisco Letter. How can I change it so that my personal contact information is used to autofill that data? I'm interested in making a one-time change, not a permanent change.\n\nA: I think you can make change by opening the Inspector and selecting the \"Link Inspector\" tab there. There you are presented with a 3 additional preferences \"Hyperlink\", \"Bookmark\" and \"Merge\". In the \"Merge\" preference you can find each line of your address and select the appropriate one. This is provided that you have correctly set you Home and Work addresses in your Address Book.\n", "Q: What are the best disk cloning tools? Money is no object. I want a bit for bit perfect copy of a hard drive/partition which is bootable (is either possible) to be used in a backup regimen.\nI have heard of some tools but your recommendations with clear outlines of the features that make it useful for you as a backup solution would be most appreciated.\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) hands down. Even Apple enterprise recommends it, and they use it for their live servers. Although SuperDuper! is fine for standard Mac OS, it is not recommended by the general population for the Server OS.\nThe latest CCC adds great features too. Use the $30 you would spend on SuperDuper! And donate it to CCC. It's what we use in the field.\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner should do the job.\nCCC (Carbon Copy Cloner) creates a bootable backup, and preserves all your files, and in the right hierarchy. You can also have incremental backups (it only backs up items that have changed since the last backup). You can schedule CCC to backup regularly. CCC also has the ability to backup over a network. I also like the Growl notifications.\n\nSuperDuper! is another handy little application. We used to use it for backing up before Time Machine came out. It has the ability to do incremental backups, so you won't be backing up the whole hard drive; just the data that's changed. Unlike CCC, it costs $27.95.\n\nAnother option would be rsync or cp. Both will have the option to make a perfect backup, invisible files included. Rsync can also backup incrementally, which means it will only backup what has changed. With rsync and cp, you can also schedule it to backup with launchd or cron.\n\nA: Clonezilla is awesome.\nFree, boots from cd / usb, works with win / mac / linux.\nGreat tool to have.\n\nA: \n… bit for bit perfect copy … \n\nDisk Utility\nIf you want bit-for-bit, use the Restore features in Disk Utility. \nIf Lion Recovery is available, you could use the Disk Utility in Mac OS X Utilities. \nWhilst you can use Disk Utility in a backup regime, I would not use it every day for that purpose. \nIs it more important for the backup to be bootable, or bit-for-bit perfect?\n\nA: Shirt Pocket's SuperDuper is a nice app, but it is pricey.\n$28, free trial available.\nOne of its good features: It allows you to perform an incremental backup that only updates what's changed.\n\nA: We use Clonezilla at work. It creates exact clones of our disks and/or partitions and dumps them on an FTP server.\nThis is also nice because we get a centralised repository of disk/partition images which we can dish out to any of our boxes pretty speedily.\n\nA: I like CCC but SuperDuper works great as well. SuperDuper costs almost $30, but it's worth it for the terrific effort the developer puts into making sure it's compatible with the current version of OS X. \nThe thing I like most about Carbon Copy Cloner is that it's free (donations encouraged) and it has a very easy to use scheduler that will remind you to turn on drives it needs to do the job, and when you turn them on, it does it without further action on your part. Either one works great for me.\n", "Q: Can I change the brightness on a secondary display? I have a MBP with a secondary display. Is is possible to have the brightness keys (F1 & F2) change both the main display (laptop screen) and the secondary display (a VGA external monitor connected via a Thunderbolt port with an adapter)? If not, is it possible to change the brightness on the secondary display?\n\nA: One of my favorite tools for doing this is Shades which is \"donationware.\"\nYou can adjust each monitor separately, and set keyboard shortcuts for them as well.\nIf you want a command line solution, I found brightness.c which compiled cleanly using:\ngcc -std=c99 -o brightness brightness.c -framework IOKit -framework ApplicationServices\n\nIt will let you set the brightness for either monitor.\nAnother tool available at: Command-line display brightness control for macOS  or just brew install screenbrightness.\n\nA: Knowing that this question is rather old I want to make you aware of https://github.com/the0neyouseek/MonitorControl which is open source, well maintained and quite handy.\n\n\n\nYou can control brightness, contrast or volume directly from a menulet or with keyboard native keys. Keyboard keys even display the native osd.\n\nA: If you have an Apple Cinema display and are adjusting brightness via the \"displays\" preference pane, note that the preference pane will show up both on your main display (the cinema display) and on the MBP. It allows you to set the brightness separately.\n\nA: A dead-simple program called Brightness Control has been dimming multiple external monitors for me since 2006. Still working fine on OS X 10.11 in 2016.\n\nOnly drawback is that you cannot simultaneously run f.lux. If you only have one external monitor, you can use Shady to dim that without quitting f.lux.\n\nA: You can use https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl - works for my Dell P2715Q\nAnd even better there is https://github.com/czarny/Brisync which even syncs brightness with your internal display\n\nA: Screen Dimmer isn't free ($2), but is the only tool I could find that handles multiple monitors (up to 3). \nSeems nice and elegant the short time I've used it. Sits in menubar, and has a simple slider and monitor selector, as well as keybindings for brightness increase/decrease.\nMy 3 external displays are non-apple (1 Dell with displayport, 1 samsung with displayport->dvi, and 1 old acer 19\" with hdmi->dvi) on a MacBook Pro Retina 15\" with 10.8.2.\nedit: For the OP's question this shouldn't matter, but fyi for 3 monitors - it seems to only allow one combination of monitors for dimming (i.e. can't dim completely separately -- this works for me as I use it to dim the 2 side monitors so they don't distract from the main middle monitor)\nedit2: The website appears to be down so here is the App Store link. Also of note it allows for dimming up to 3 monitors but remember your MacBook does count as 1 if it's open. If you have 3 externals this means you can't dim the far right one. But, you can just close your MacBook and then you can dim all 3 externals.\n\nA: I have two screens connected to my Mac Pro. (This also works for MacBook Pro.) I have the USB on the first screen connected to the Mac. The second screen has its USB connected into the back of the first screen (the 2nd screen display adapter uses an extender to get to the Mac - you could likewise use a USB extender to get to the back of the Mac).\nWith both screens communicating to the Mac via screen as well as USB, F1 and F2 as brightness control the dimming of the first display, Ctrl+F1 and Ctrl+F2 control the second screen. No need to disconnect at all.\n\nA: I tried most of the other suggested solutions. On the latest High Sierra with a non-Apple external display over usb-C these suggestions didn't work. I did stumble upon an app called EasyOnTheEyes that actually does the trick. https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/easyontheeyes/id799584781?mt=12 . It hasn't been updated in a while, but still seems to work.\n\nA: Another option is Brightness Slider, free in App store.\n\nA: I have 2 thunderbolt displays connected to my MBP. I had to connect only one display at a time in order to adjust the brightness. Then I reconnected them both and all was well. Too bad the control panel doesn't show the brightness slider on both displays but this is a simple solution.\n\nA: There are many answers here, but one wasn't mentioned (though it only has limited applicability---you need to have a second keyboard handy.)  When I have a second display hooked up to my MBP, and a second keyboard plugged in, then the built-in laptop keyboard's function keys control the built-in (main) laptop LCD and the external keyboard's function keys work for the secondary.  \nIn case it's changed, this is on 10.6.8.\n\nA: I have MBP early 2011 connected to LED display and Thunderbolt display and I use the thunderbolt display as extended desktop.\nThis is how you can adjust the brightness on second display.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press cmd+F1. This will mirror the displays.\n\n*Press F1 or F2 and both screens will increase or decrease in brightness.\n\n*When you are done, press cmd+F1 and your screens will revert back to extended desktop mode.\n\n\nOk, its a pain if you are like me and have items configured on both screens but I found using \"shades\" the second monitor was always looking dimmer and not the same brightness as the primary screen.\n\nA: On Apple displays, if you press Control-F1 or Control-F2 the brightness on a secondary display will adjust. I have tested this on my MacBook Air 2011 13\" and 27\" Thunderbolt Display.\nImportant note: You have to plug in the USB cable from the Display to the Macbook Pro in order that the keyboard shortcuts work.\nIf you're using a MacBook with Touch Bar, this works for the \"brighter\"/\"less bright\" Touch Bar buttons but NOT for the Touch Bar brightness slider.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Macs don't have access to an external display's brightness settings. On most displays, that is only controllable using the physical buttons/menus on the display itself.\nI agree that this would be a great feature to see, but it isn't really possible now to control brightness over the video cable.\nNote that I can't speak for Apple's Cinema Display and Thunderbolt; I haven't tried that and it may be different.\n\nA: Lunar is an app which allows you to automatically sync the system display brightness with the brightness of an external monitor.\nWith Lunar, you can use the standard display controls (and keyboard keys!) to adjust the brightness simultaneously on the main and external display, which is exactly what I wanted. It also supports tweaking of brightness and contrast ranges/offsets to get exactly the desired levels.\nLunar is not restricted to any specific display type or connection method, so it should work with most displays connected over USB-C, Thunberbolt, etc.\n\nA: If you're using an Apple Cinema Display it is possible to control brightness as long as you connect the display's USB cable to your Mac. The causes a \"Brightness\" slider to appear on the screen's control panel in \"Displays\" System Preferences. Unfortunately the F1 and F2 don't change the brightness settings on the external screen.\n\nA: After experimenting with lots of hot keys I found a solution.\nI am using a dual screen setup with 27 inch iMac which is connected to a 27 inch Thunderbolt screen.\nUsing cmd+ F1 (mirror displays) will also duplicate the screen brightness of screen 1 to screen 2.\nNow you can dim the 2nd screen with F1\nRepeat the cmd+ F1 and the 2nd screen will revert to last brightness.\nNow you can dim the iMac screen with the brightness keys.\n\nA: Open System Preferences;\nClick Displays;\nIn the lower left hand menu, click the Show displays in menu bar;\nOnce your menu bar has the little icon of your monitor, click it and select \nOpen Display Preferences;\nAll monitors will have a Preferences menu linked to that specific object.\n\nA: If you are using a 24\" thunderbolt display which has a USB cable in addition to the thunderbolt cable,\nyou have to have both plugged in.\nThen Ctrl + F1 and Ctrl + F2 should work.\n\nA: If you run Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8, you can adjust brightness easily with Mac Brightness Control utility.\n", "Q: iPad Pages Password Protection I've read that pages on iPad can access protected files created on Pages (mac).  Can you also edit the files on iPad, or are they locked?  If you can edit the files, do they become unlocked, or do they retain the protection.\nIt would be great if someone could enlighten me on the nature of password protection (in iWork apps) on the iPad. :)\n\nA: You can access the protected files by entering the password.  However, you will get the warning that by opening the document it will become a Pages for iOS document, and thus will no longer be password protected.  You do have the option of 'Opening a Copy' thereby preserving the originals password.\nThis could be useful if you just need access to the document to read it and then deleting the copy.  Not so useful if you need to edit the doc and save it and have the password intact.\n", "Q: How can I fix Lion Mail's search functionality? I made a clean install of Lion, configured Mobile Me in System Preferences.\nSo, when I opened Mail, my Mobile Me account was already configured and it started downloading my mails.\nEverything worked fine except search. I can't search among every mails. The only search I can do using is \"from\" or \"to\" a contact of my address book.\nSearching the web, I discovered some potential solutions that I tried unsuccessfully. Here's a list of what I already done :\n\n\n*\n\n*repairing permissions\n\n*disabling Spotlight and re-enabling Spotlight for my whole disk (via the preference pane & via the terminal)\n\n*deleting the \"envelope-index\" file and get mail re-index all my mails\n\n*rebuilding each mailboxes\n\n*deleting ~/Library/Mail, ~/Library/Mail Downloads, ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.* in order to start over\n\n*starting again from my ~/Library/Mail folder from my Snow Leopard installation.\n\n*starting again without configuring Mobile Me in system preferences but directly in Mail (as different computer user)\n\n\nNone of these actions fixed my problem.\nHave you got any ideas?\nEdit :\nI made a new clean install of Lion on an external hard drive, configured my Mobile Me account directly when opening Mail.app and everything worked fine. I tried to copy Mail.app-related files to my main installation of Lion, but that didn't work. My latest solution would be install Lion again on my internal hard drive, but I would prefer not to do so. I'm still hoping there's another solution.\n\nA: I had the same problem and it turned out the index was broken.\nA rebuild didn't work for me so I had to quit Mail and type (in the terminal):\ncd ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/\nrm -rf Envelope\\ Index Envelope\\ Index-shm  Envelope\\ Index-wal\n\nAfter that, reopening the Mail app took some time for the index to rebuild but it fixed the search index.\nThanks to MacRumors for the answer\n\nA: I don't know if we are having the same problem but I initially thought we did until I fixed it. For some reason I had the \"Mail\" folder under the Privacy tab in Spotlight in System Preferences. \nRemoving the folder from the and Mail worked fine again.\nI doubt you did the same but I can't hurt mentioning this..\n\nA: Does restoring a copy of your Snow Leopard mail folders from ~/Library/Application Support to a new user in Lion have the same problem? That's saved me in the past when an upgrade didn't work so well in mail.\n\nA: Doing a clean install of Lion again and configuring Mail.app before the Mobile Me preferences pane solved the problem for me.\n(this didn't work as a new user on my old installation)\nThat's probably overkill, but I tried everything I could without success, so…\n\nA: Go to Mail preferences > Accounts > MobileMe account > Advanced tab. Look for a setting labeled \"Keep copies of messages for offline viewing\", and make sure it is set to keep copies of messages, otherwise Spotlight can't populate its index with your message contents.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my IMAP accounts and I could only search for keywords in new emails (= mails that arrived AFTER I upgraded to Lion). Rebuilding the index solved this problem for me.\nMailbox -> Rebuild\nSee also: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mail/2.0/en/ml1136.html\n\nA: My solution was to delete the index files which Mail rebuilt unprompted:\nhttps://plus.google.com/105247387818704991250/posts/LzvM2sfa1rX\n\nA: You should also try deleting the Spotlight index and forcing Spotlight to re-index your entire hard drive.\nI'm sure there's a command line action for this, but I use the commercial utility MacPilot.\n\n\nA: My Mail and spotlight searching stopped working at some point in 10.7.2.\nRe-Indexing Spotlight did not work nor rebuilding the Mail inboxes.\nWhat just now seems to have worked though, is I notice there was a \"_spotlight\" user listed on my Users folders permissions.  This I think is something to do with ACL. Doing a search, I found that you could try and get spotlight to index on attached AFP partition And the \"_spotlight\" user was involved.\nUsing apples server app I shared my Users folder. This re added the \"_spotlight\" with custom permissions. And I deleted the old one (\"_spotlight\" ) from the same user permissions pane.\nI un-checked all share options. i.e afp smb. \nSpotlight started indexing and I can now do searches in Mail and the finder.\nIf I Un-share again I cannot get search results. Switch sharing on again I can.\n", "Q: Can I change the URL for RSS feed in NetNewsWire? Is it possible to change the URL of a RSS feed in NetNewsWire?

I want to add this to my dock so that those apps are grouped together and the dock isn't quite as messy. No problem; I added the folder to the dock and it's displaying as a stack. The only problem is, the icon displayed in the dock is the icon of the first app in the folder, rather than the custom icon I assigned to the folder in Finder. Is there a way to force the dock to display the custom icon?\n\nA: Right click (or ⌃ ctrl-click) the folder in the Dock, and select Display as: Folder from the menu that appears.\n\n\nA: You can't really.  What you can do is add another item to the folder that has the custom icon, and then give it a name that would make it show up alphabetically first.\nFor example, this is a set of icons that make your stacks look like the files are in a box:  http://t.ecksdee.org/post/19001860/stacks-overlays\n\n\nA: I may be wrong, but Candybar should work.\n\nA: Yes, you CAN do it. You don't have to use the \"put the picture in the stack\" option. The trick is HOW you copy and paste.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the folder enclosing the files of the stack. Open \"info\"\n\n*OPEN the jpg you want as the folder icon\n\n*Click \"edit, COPY\" (copying in finder WILL NOT WORK)\n\n*Click on the icon of the folder in the INFO window\n\n*PASTE\n\n\nYou're done. I've done this on multiple folders in my dock.\n\nA: You need to change the icon of the folder that contains the items in the stack.  This can be done in several ways, but perhaps the easiest is to start by navigate to the folder of the stack, change that icon, and set the stack to display the folder instead of the contents. \nClick the stack, click \"Open in Finder\" in the stack, and then press the keystroke ⌘ + ▲.  The key press will take you \"one level up\" in the directory hierarchy so that you are now looking at the folder that houses the items in the stack.\nNext, select the folder (If it's not already selected), and \"get info\" on it, by typing ⌘ + I, or right-clicking and selecting \"Get Info\".  At the top of this window will be a miniature icon of a folder.  You can click on this and copy it via the keyboard shortcut (⌘ + C), or paste in an image that you copied from somewhere else.\nFinally, you need to right-click on the stack and set it to display \"folder\" and not the stack contents.\n\nA: The dock folder icon is taken from the first item in an alphabetical list of its contents. When the one you want isn't the first in the list change its name to begin with a space character. It then is moved to the top of the list and its icon is used on the dock folder. eg. here's my Video Live dock folder. I want the most used to appear at the top.\n\n", "Q: Enforce maximum content width in Safari (Lion full-screen on big monitor) Web sites vary as to whether they enforce a maximum width for the content within the window. When running Safari full screen on Lion, is there a simple way (without rolling up my sleeves and playing with style sheets) to establish my own maximum width? Lines of text are too long if I happen to be connected to my 24\" monitor, but I like how this full screen mode maximizes vertical space.\n\nA: You can change the width of each page in full-screen Safari.\nMove your cursor all the way to either side of the 'window', until you see the normal window resize cursor. Click and drag in, and the 'window' will shrink horizontally.\nYou can set a different width for each tab.\n\nA: If you would like to enforce a maximum width across all web sites permanently, you can use a user style sheet file (Safari Preferences → Advanced → Style sheet) with something like the following content:\nhtml { \n  /* adjust number to taste */\n  max-width: 800px;\n\n  /* horizontal centering */\n  margin-left: auto;\n  margin-right: auto;\n}\n\nNathan's answer is probably more useful, but this is how you could do it if they hadn't included the resizing feature.\n(This has a chance of breaking the layout of any web site that's using the same approach to set up a smaller column width than you asked for.)\n", "Q: Did Mail.app once allow messages to be annotated with notes? I thought I remembered being able to add notes to a message in a pane over the main message (as well as todos). In Lion, I don't see how to do that. I can create individual notes but not annotate a message. \nAm I remembering correctly? Is there some way to get that feature back in Lion (without using MailTags, which won't sync across machines with my Gmail accounts)? \nI never really cared about the feature but found a use for it just this week.\n\nA: yes and no\nyes: it was possible to \"annotate\" mails with a todo - that function is gone in Lion\nno: afaik it was not possible to \"annotate\" mails with a note as well\n\nA: You may be thinking of annotations in Preview.app. \nAs far as I could tell by looking at the Wikipedia history for Mail and the Ars Technica reviews for past Mac OS X releases, Mail has not had annotations. Unless you're talking about Notes, which alongside To Do's, where added in Version 3 of Mail in Leopard. \nHope this helps. \n", "Q: How do I increase rendering speed on Final Cut Express? How do I increase render speed on FCE? I have several overlaid HD video tracks, and it is SLOW.\nEDIT: I am on a MBP 13\", 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5, 4GB 1333 MHz DDR3. The render disk is an external USB drive.\nEDIT: I found out that FCP has a feature that allow you to only render video to a certain quality (or bit rate...something like that). Does FCE have a feature that does this same thing?\nEDIT: Oh, and...if I upgrade to FCE 4, will rendering be faster?\nEDIT: I am on FCE 4.\n\nA: I imagine the USB disk is probably a source of the bottleneck.  Try using a Firewire 800 disk.\n\nA: Adding RAM is usually the cheapest way to improve speed. I went from 4 GB to 12 GB in my iMac and FCPX improved dramatically.\nAlso I recently upgraded from a USB Drobo (1st Gen) to a Firewire 800 Drobo (2nd or 3rd Gen) and my disk speeds increased a lot.\nA few other quick things: Make sure you're not running any other apps when FCE is running. And you should run a utility like Onyx or Applejack to clear up any file permissions issues or other cruft that comes from running a modern OS.\n\nA: Ok, so after much research, I finally found out that the reason it was taking so long to export was because I was exporting from the external drive to the external drive. I fixed the problem by exporting from the external drive to the internal drive. I am also probably going to switch to a Firewire 800 drive.\n\nA: What version of FCE are you running? It sounds like it's less than version 4. If you're running anything less than version 3.5, it's a PowerPC version, and thus is running a lot slower than it would be if you ran v3.5 or higher, which is Intel-native.\nCan't guarantee this is your problem, but it's what I would check first.\n\nA: Convert all footage to The Apple Intermediate Codec ( AIC )first before importing. Makes a big difference in rendering time. Use MPEG Streamclip to convert\n", "Q: How do I connect an internal SATA drive to Mini-SAS? I have a SATA III SSD which I would like to connect to an ATTO technologies' SATA II card in my Mac Pro. The SSD uses the typical internal SATA interface while the ATTO card uses Mini-SAS both internally and externally.\nWhat do I need to plug the SSD into the ATTO card?

I've been researching various SSD's to put in my 2011 MBP, and I've come across quite a few reviews and threads indicating various reliability and performance issues, even with the popular models.\nFor example, I've read that the OCZ Vertex 3 models are very popular, but I've also read that they have intractable issues.\nCan someone give me some advice or experiences they've had with various brands? Is OCZ Vertex 3 a good choice or does it have issues with MBPs?\nPS: I know that what is \"best\" may be subjective, and I know that this is similar to this older post, but I still think it would be valuable to have an up-to-date version of this question as HW options change frequently.\n\nA: The best available data are not yet good enough to separate fact from fiction on SSD reliability among vendors or even as compared to spinning metal.\nThere's an excellent review at Tom's Hardware that explores what is currently known about SSD reliability.\nFrom the article:\n\n... Many of the IT managers we interviewed reiterated that Intel's SLC-based SSDs are the shining standard by which others are measured. But ... there's nothing to suggest that its products are significantly more reliable than the best hard drive solutions. We don’t have failure rates beyond two years of use for SSDs, so it’s possible that this story will change.\n\n\nA: It's always worth revisiting this great post by Jeff Atwood on the subject.

Any suggestions?\n\nA: This could happen for a number of reasons, one of those could be that you unplugged a FireWire drive while spotlight was indexing it. You may have to reset spotlight indexes to stop the error appearing if this has happened. You can do so with the Terminal command below. \nsudo mdutil -E /\nSpotlight will need to reindex all your drives which will take some time, allow it to finish indexing each drive before unplugging it and that may solve the problem\nSee the link below for an article from someone with a similar issue who solved it performing the steps above  \nhttp://www.mb.com.ph/articles/209838/the-case-missing-firewire-port\n\nA: A good test will be to power off the mac and disconnect all FireWire cords. \nWhen you boot, hold Command-Option-P-R to reset the hardware tree which is stored in NVRAM. \nIf you still get the errors, your OS or FireWire ports are suspect. Since the messages are so numerous, you should be able to narrow down the cause with a little testing. \nI'm of the mind that it's more likely a cord or device, but best to start with the mac itself first. \n\nA: If you don't use the FireWire port, try entirely disabling it.\nMove out of the /System/Library/Extensions directory all FireWire modules.\nYou can do so by running:\nmkdir ~/Desktop/disabled_firewire_modules\nsudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/IOFireWire*.kext ~/Desktop/disabled_firewire_modules\n\nin the terminal. Disabled modules will go to the desktop.\nSource: https://discussions.apple.com/message/9200953#9200953\n", "Q: How to diagnose why plugins don't show in Photoshop? I have some Photoshop plugins in a folder PSPlugins in my home folder.  When Photoshop runs, it doesn't see them.  I did put the correct path into the preferences.  Is there some way to determine why Photoshop doesn't see these plugins?  Does it really not see any plugins, or does it see them but doesn't like how they taste?  \nDoes PS write a log file stating where it looks, what it finds, and any error messages?\n\nA: One thing to try is to find the Photoshop application, and Get Info on it. You can do this by selecting it in your Applications solder and pressing Command I or right clicking and choose Get Info. If you see a check box marked Open in 32 bit mode try selecting it, and then launch photoshop again.\nPlugins for all programs generally need to be 32 bit if the host app is running in this mode, or 64 bit if the app is. \nThis is from experience with Logic plugins, which would refuse to acknowledge some older 32bit plugins when running in 64 bit mode.\nHaving typed this, I've since found this relevant page: http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/828/cpsid_82824.html#main_32%2064%20bit%20launch\n", "Q: Can app store purchase be shared with a Mac running older version of Mac OS X? I'm running Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.8 and need to install an app that can only be downloaded from the App store.  If I download it to a newer Mac can I install it on my main Mac running 10.5.8? When I click \"Buy App\" it starts the install immediately.  I would like for it to just be a download that I could transfer to my other Mac and delete from the mac downloading the App. Is this possible? How?\n\nA: An install on Mac OS is generally just copying the relevant files into place. Usually, you'll be able to copy an app's bundle over from one machine to the other. The only thing is that the App Store will have some sort of DRM, so just copying it may not work. I suspect that the answer is no, because you'll need to sign in to the App Store, but I haven't tried it. (On the other hand, I've installed Lion on a Leopard machine via a disk without Sow Leopard.) Additionally, Apps that are downloaded from the Mac App store will carry minimum system requirements that might prevent them  from running altogether, even if you theoretically circumvented the DRM from the App Store.\n\nA: No, you cannot. The DRM associated with App Store downloads requires that you log into the App Store application. the App Store application will not run on systems below 10.6.6.\nThere are very rare exceptions to this rule... applications that do not install from the App Store, but instead download an installer program. Lion itself and Xcode are the only two I can think of that behave this way.\n\nA: Some apps on the Mac App Store do not check if an app is registered at launch, so it is possible just to copy the .app file to an older Mac.  However, an app that is exclusively available in the Mac App Store is most likely not compatible with Leopard.  So, even if the developer does not enforce the App Store's built-in DRM system, it is not likely that the app would run on OS X Leopard.\n\nA: When you click \"Buy App\", it should start downloading, not installing. Make sure this is the case.\nIn any case, once the app is downloaded, you can follow any of these instructions to burn the install image to a CD or DVD. You can use that to install Lion on your older system.\n", "Q: Will renaming my Windows partition from BOOTCAMP break anything? I've installed Windows 7 via BootCamp. I'd like to rename the partition from BOOTCAMP to something a little easier on the eyes. Will renaming my Windows partition from \"BOOTCAMP\" to \"Windows\" break anything? (Should I do it from the Windows side or the Mac side?)\n\nA: It won't break anything. Only issue is that if you're using a FAT partition, the name will be all capitals. Rename from either Windows or OS X if you have an appropriate driver installed.\n\nA: I agree that it should not break anything. I would do it while booted into Windows, because I would assume that Windows would know to make sure the change is reflected anywhere else it is necessary.\n(I'm not an expert on Windows but I did rename my BOOTCAMP partition under Snow Leopard without any negative results.)\n", "Q: Repairing macports after deleting image folders I was having problems uninstalling a package in macports (gimp2-devel, to be exact) due to some \"directory not empty\" errors. I discover from comments made by the maintainer of macports that it's OK to delete these folders, so I went and did so, thusly:\nrm -rf /opt/local/var/macports/software/aalib/1.4rc5_4\n\n(There was another one as well; I forget which.)\nHowever I am now re-installing gimp2-devel, and it bombs out thusly:\n--->  Computing dependencies for gimp2-devel\n--->  Dependencies to be installed: aalib\nError: Target org.macports.activate returned: Image error: Can't find image file /opt/local/var/macports/software/aalib/1.4rc5_4\nError: Failed to install aalib\nLog for aalib is at: /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_ports_graphics_aalib/aalib/main.log\nError: The following dependencies were not installed: aalib\nError: Status 1 encountered during processing.\n\nSo, it seems that the advice I followed has in fact borked the two libraries I had to remove folders for.

The issue happened because I had a connection failure part way through the transfer of gcc44, and it truncated the tar archive. I deleted this and expected it to fetch it again, but I just got the missing image error, and I couldn't find out how to get a copy of it. I tried all kinds of things like those above including rebuilding it, cleaning etc, but what eventually fixed it was\nsudo port uninstall -f gcc44\nsudo port install gcc44\n\n\nA: Did you try port -f activate aalib.\n\nA: Possibly obvious to you, but the first thing I'd try... look at [long-path-to-log-file]/main.log for anything relevant, especially near the end\nThen maybe ...\nport -f install aalib - hopefully a \"manual\" install can get it back\n\nA: Ah, here's a solution:\nsudo port upgrade outdated\n\nPossibly not ideal for people who do not wish to be forced to upgrade their installed ports, but for me it fixed the broken items and upgrading hasn't hurt anything.

My question is can a 27\" iMac (with Thunderbolt), while in Target Display Mode, offer the same ports via thunderbolt cable?\nAka: if I get a new MacBook Air, do I get all the ports through my 27\" iMac as I would through a Thunderbolt Display?\n\nA: No. Devices connected to the iMac's other ports will still only be accessible by the iMac, not by the connected MacBook.\nYou can approximate some of the functionality you might get from this by using various software solutions to share your iMac's devices - such as sharing drives over the network, or sharing the mouse and keyboard using Synergy, etc.\n\nA: In addition to image from the MacBook Air, you also get a sound — when music plays on MacBook Air, it goes through Thunderbolt to speakers, connected to iMac\n", "Q: Lion not searching SMB volume I just upgraded to Lion on my work computer and it seems like Spotlight doesn't index SMB volumes. This used to work for me perfectly under Snow Leopard. I've talked with Apple and they said it was never a supported feature, and just worked by coincidence on 10.6. Now it's not working at all. When I run the mdutil command in the terminal it says \"indexing and searching disabled.\"\nCan indexing be enabled for SMB data on Lion?\n\nA: I was able to get this working by adding the volume to Privacy section of Spotlight System Preferences, then removing said share from the same location.\nI think this is how I got it working in previous versions as well.\n\nA: Until Apple makes Spotlight available for network drives, the best solution is Devon technologies EasyFind. We have it installed on all our campus Macs for just this purpose. It is fast, can save search parameters, and best of all - free.\n\n\nA: Check your System Prefs>Spotlight when the volume is mounted.

I have a Mighty Mouse that came with an iMac nearly four years ago, and the scroll ball won't turn anymore. Is it possible to clean that or do something to make it usable again?\n\nA: Try flipping the mouse upside down and rolling the trackball on a piece of paper, giving it an occasional tap to help dislodge any debris. Since the trackball is depressed while rolling , this helps debris escape from inside the housing. The paper will also help absorb any oil from your fingers that have collected on the ball that may allow debris to collect inside the roller mechanisms.\n\n\n*\n\n*The 'official' Apple fix is to first spray the paper with alcohol cleaner, then roll the ball over it. This has always worked for me, never had to take apart.\n\n\nA: This video tutorial entitled \"How To Clean An Apple Mighty Mouse Scroll Bar\" may help.\n\nA: I've had this problem with multiple mice in the past before.  The roll on paper did work for a few weeks months (I usually applied a few drops of alcohol to the ball before doing it). But essentially when this problem starts, the mouse is going downhill and nothing much can be done about it (the problem will reoccur within shorter and shorter time).  \nI tried opening two of the mice which didn't respond to other solutions anymore, figuring I couldn't damage them any further because they were already useless anyway.  It worked with one with little damage to the case and putting it together with a few drops of glue.  The other, while managing to open it with little damage, failed to work afterwards because I damaged the insides of the scroll ball unit.\n\nA: The mouse you have is called a Mighty Mouse. There are various ways to clean it. See this previous question, for example.\n\nA: I recommend disassembly of the mouse and cleaning the track ball with ear swabs and alcohol\n\nA: I used all kind of tricks to clean my Mighty Mouse but at the end none of them was a long term solution, the track ball got stuck quite soon again, independently of how carefully I was with cleaning. I ended up with taking the mouse apart. That worked. You need a (very) small amount of glue to put it back again (if you are anal about the plastic ring underneath the mouse - I used my mouse for months without it because I didn't have any glue).\nSo, take your mouse apart and clean it. That is the only longterm solution.\n", "Q: How do I delete just the Time Machine files on my Drobo external filesystem? I have a folder on my Drobo called \"HFS+ Private Directory Data\" and it contains old Time Machine data. I cannot delete it and do not want to reformat my drobo. I have tried 'option' trashing and various Terminal hacks but to no avail. I am using Lion now. \nIt's about 36 GB and I would love this space back. I'm running Lion on a 2006 MacPro and it's a four bay Drobo with 3 TB of 4 TB used. I use the Drobo for image files and a separate drive for Time Machine.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Can't you delete it from the Time Machine interface?  Or is this a backup from a computer you no longer use?  If the latter then there shouldn't be much/any risk in just force deleting it.  If I remember right then you need to clear the immutable flag from the directory (or from all the files?)\n\nA: You probably shouldn't try to delete it by hand.  See the Hard Links section of: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#technotes/tn/tn1150.html\nIt contains info about hard links on your filesystem which are key to how Time Machine works.

Is it possible to plug a Thunderbolt cinema display into a Mini DisplayPort-equipped Mac and have it work?  This question suggests that it's possible and that it's pretty much the same cable, but I don't see any explicit confirmation anywhere.\n\nA: Plugs are the same, cables are not. The thunderbolt cables contain chips and firmware.\nI haven't used the new Thunderbolt display, however I am aware of the following:\nMiniDP Macbook -> MiniDP iMac 27: works fine.\nThunderbolt Macbook -> MiniDP iMac 27: works fine.\nMiniDP Macbook -> Thunderbolt iMac 27: does not work\nThunberbolt Macbook -> Thunderbolt iMac 27: works fine.\nThis is in my experience and confirmed from various Apple KB articles. So I believe it's likely you won't be able to use the Thunderbolt display on a MiniDP machine, as that is certainly the case with the iMac 27\" models.\n\nA: The short answer is no. Apple's Thunderbolt Display requires a thunderbolt signal (and only that) to operate. \nThe spec page for the display implies very strongly that Thunderbolt displays will only work with Thunderbolt Macs.\nThis happens to concern me since I own a previous-generation iMac (pre-Thunderbolt) and really wanted to have the option to use it with a Thunderbolt display.  So I asked the guys at the Apple Store.\nThe Apple Store told me no, it will not work on a non-Thunderbolt Mac.\nSorry to be the bearer of bad news :(.\n", "Q: Moving Bootcamp to new Macbook Pro Is it possible to move Boot Camp from Macbook Pro Late 2008 w/ Lion to Macbook Pro 2011 w/ Lion?\nI have been trying unsuccessfully for several days.\nI used WinClone to successfully image my old Bootcamp, and then ran it on my new Macbook, but it errored just before it finished.\nThe error was similar to this one:\nhttp://roaringapps.com/app:904#post-2927\nThe command line commands in that article fixed my first problem of Windows not showing up on reboot despite holding the  key, but now when I boot into it, it just blue screens.\nSo my question is:  Is this even possible?  \nIs the hardware difference between the two Macbooks causing the blue screen, and the only solution is to re-install from scratch?\n\nA: I believe that this is a problem with Windows as opposed to Boot Camp.  Windows, if I remember correctly looks for the serial numbers and unique identifiers when it starts up and has a conniption if they're not what it's expecting.  I ran into this a few years ago when I had the logic board replaced on my iMac.  I think your best bet might be to reinstall Windows on your new machine and migrate your data and settings over within Windows (that might also help Windows by giving a fresh, healthy install).\n", "Q: Can you run Disk Utility from bootable lion disk? I've made a bootable lion disk by extracting the InstallESD.dmg from the lion installer app's package contents. - (Contents>SharedSupport>InstallESD.dmg)\nWhen booting from this disk, can you run disk utility or any other utilities from the menu bar (like you could in the SL install)?\nThanks\n\nA: Yes, you can.  plug in the disk, boot up in it by holding down option, select the disk, and and then run disk utility from the main window.\nWhy do this however, when you have the Restore partition available to do this without a disk?\n", "Q: Can I safely delete the Classic System folder when running Lion? I still have a folder called \"System Folder\" that belongs to the Classic environment. It takes up almost 400MB on my disk. Since I'm running Lion, can I safely delete the entire folder?\n\nA: Considering the Classic environment was phased out versions ago, I think it would be completely safe to delete a folder belonging to the classic environment.\n\nA: It's probably safe to delete it, unless you're like me.  For example, I still keep a directory of pictures in the Appearance directory that I use for wallpaper.  Old habits die hard. :-) You might want to check if you have anything similarly quirky.\n\nA: Absolutely. Everything equivalent that Lion needs resides in the new \"System\" folder (and others) so you can freely delete your old System Folder. \n\nA: I did a clean install of Lion and there is no \"/System Folder/\" there, therefore I believe that you can safely delete the folder \"/System Folder/\" however make sure you do not delete the \"/System/\" folder, otherwise you'll be left with an unbootable system.\n(Of course you have a working backup, right ;-?)\n", "Q: How to register Outlook 2011 to send emails from iPhoto? I had Office 2008 for Mac (with Entourage) installed. I never used Entourage and didn't have any email accounts configured. Then I installed Office 2011 without 'uninstalling' 2008 and setup Outlook 2011.\nHowever in iPhoto I only see Mail and Entourage as the options for sending mail. \nAny ideas how I can get Outlook 2011 to come up in the Entourage Mail options?\nI am running Snow Leopard and iPhoto that came with my late 2009 MBP.\nThanks,\nSumit.\n\nA: There is no built-in way to do this, but some poking around turned up this article, which basically involves modifying the Entourage script to use Outlook instead. The instructions are for iPhoto '09, but the comments indicate that it should work with iPhoto '11.\n", "Q: What are the great iPhone apps to discover new music? Back in the days I used Last.fm suggestions  but they are way too generic and aren't useful to me anymore.  I switched to RYM and its recommendation engine is much nicer, however I'm also looking for some iPhone apps that would allow me to discover awesome new music on the go.\nI'm looking for these features:\n\n\n*\n\n*an easy way to browse through artists and albums;\n\n*a wide range of non-mainstream artists;\n\n*a recommendation engine and/or a smart “similar artists” engine;\n\n*track previews (at least 30 sec.);\n\n*no limitations on total preview play count;\n\n*no need to subscribe to any paid service;\n\n*ideally, reviews for selected albums;\n\n*some kind of bookmarking to store my findings.\n\n\nI don't care for the price if the app meets my needs.\nWhat does AppStore have to offer?\nPlease, post one app per answer.\n\nA: Discovr is a great app for this. You just enter the name of an artist, and then a list of related artists appear. A network graph appears with all of the artists. You can play previews, and watch videos. Pretty decent app.\n\nA: It won't necessarily fulfill all your criteria, but Pandora is a great place to start. :)\nPandora syncs \"radio stations\" with pandora.com.  These stations are created based a specific type of music, music that sounds like a specific song or artist.  A certain amount of skips are allowed per hour, to find something you like in a particular station. After that point you must listen to what the station has or switch to another station.\n\nA: SuperSonic by HunterMedia\nWhile the app doesn't let you directly browse artists and albums, it definitely uses a terrific recommendation engine and lets you focus on finding the new music—by not standing in  your way and getting a bunch of recommended tracks based on a given artist seed.\nEach preview lasts for a whole minute which I think is enough to form an opinion (and bookmark the track). Bookmarked tracks can be re-listened at any time (with the same time constraint). The buy icon link is small and non-obtrusive.\nOut of ten tracks I have listened to, I loved eight and two of them were by my two other favorite bands that the app had no way of knowing.  I also came to like the “passive discovery” workflow where  I hear new music without having to browse through the bands and tap tap tap.\nLast.fm radio was never even close to this.\nAnd SuperSonic is free.\nThe last bit that got me was adjustable recommendations popularity, danceability, tempo and the ability to ignore these settings altogether.\n", "Q: After upgrade to Lion, Mailplane experiences repeated failures to connect I'm a happy longtime Mailplane (Mac gmail client) user, but it seems to have become buggy since installing Lion.\nThere's nothing official on the website about problems, so maybe its just me and/or my configuration.\nAnybody else have problems?

The stuff in your browser cache, email signature images...garbage.\nThe Last Opened Date option is super close! Buuut, if you create a new file, save it, and close it, it doesn't count as Opened. You would have to open it again to be included.\nHopefully the Last Opened Date behavior is just a bug. Otherwise, I'm not sure how to get this huge timesaver back.\n\nA: Phew! I decided to do more digging on my own.\nI took a look at a computer still using Snow Leopard and right-clicked on its \"Today\" folder to reveal its path:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/CannedSearches\nIt turns out this directory still exists in Lion!\nSo go to Finder, and use the Go To Folder command (cmd-shift-g), and enter that path above.

And is this related to my complete machine failures? I'm on my third mid-2011 MacBook Air in less than a month and this weird wifi problem may be related to the sudden, black screen bricklike nature of its predecessors.\nThe Air works fine when in the same large living room as the NexusLink 5631 router, but when I go into adjacent rooms, including, irritatingly, the one where my desk is, it repeatedly loses and regains its wifi signal. (Sites don't load in the browser, it stops being able to play music to the speakers in the living room, it stops being able to find the Time Machine backup drive in the living room, etc.)\nMy several year old MacBook does not have this problem and we haven't changed the router setup. This lost wifi signal problem is purely an issue with the Air.\nThe first two Airs I had suffered catastrophic failures. The pattern I can reconstruct is that at after getting them and using Time Machine to restore them to have all my old files, I had put them on my desk in the other room and put them to sleep in there overnight for the first time. In the morning they would not start, would not even display any error. The folks at the Genius Bar couldn't figure out what was wrong with them (as far as I know could get no response from them at all) and so exchanged them for new machines.\nWhen Airs #1 and #2 failed they had been connected to \n1) a power supply that was connected to a power strip plugged into an outlet;\n2) an external Nocent LCD monitor LM965WA with their lids up, displays unmirrored;\n3) a powered Aquagate Monospace USB 2.0 7 port hub;\n4) through the hub, a powered down HP Deskjet 920C printer; a powered up Brother HL2140 laser printer; and a Fitbit base station.\nThey had been connected to Time Machine on a Drobo in the other room, adding to the same history as previous machines.\nNote that all of the above had been used without issue, apart from dropping wifi signal, prior to the overnight machine deaths. Also note that the old MacBook performed great for months and months in this setup.\nWith Air #3, we got a lot more cautious. \nWe started a new sparsebundle to give it its own Time Machine history, on the principle that perhaps a history going back to 2008 was too much for it to handle over the air.\nI have successfully put Air #3 to sleep overnight in the living room (where the router is) plugged into a new power cable.\nI have also done so in the other room on my desk, also with new cable, using the same power outlet, but not going through the surge suppressor.\nAir #3 has the same wifi dropping problem as the prior two Airs, so I'm wondering if this is an issue I'd have with any new machine or if I have received three defective machines.\nMy QA process to see if Air #3 will die overnight like it's pals is going to involve step by step letting it sleep overnight reintroducing one at a time the elements above, postponing the surge suppressor and Fitbit to last in the process.\nHowever, it is unclear if the wifi issue is a cause of the failure (hard to see quite how when the machine is asleep and not trying to connect to, say, do an enormous Time Machine backup) or merely a coincidentally occurring problem.\nTroubleshooting suggestions or pointers to others with either of these problems would be gratefully received!\n\nA: Is your old MacBook (the one which doesn't drop connection) running Lion or a previous OSX release?\nThe reason why I'm asking this is that I suspect it might be an issue with Lion, and not with the Air.\nI have an early 2009 17\" MacBook Pro that never dropped Wifi while at home, ever. Since upgrading to Lion 1 week ago, I lost Wifi 3 or 4 times, but only for a short period (it automatically reconnects after a few seconds).\nI am confident that it's not a router failure, as one of the time my MBP dropped wifi I was downloading a file on my wife's iMac (over Wifi) and it didn't drop.\nFwiw, my router is a 2nd-gen (dual-band) Time Capsule.\n\nA: Well, there are a lot of forums about Lion loosing Wifi (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3190651?start=15&tstart=0, http://osxdaily.com/2011/07/22/wifi-dropping-in-os-x-lion-fixes). I had trouble with SL, but Lion (even 10.7.1) is the master in it. There are a lot of fixes, for me worked, so far, a manual IP and DNS 8.8.8.8. There are more options on the links. Good luck!\n\nA: I think that it is very likely that you received another defective MacBook Air.  However, be sure that there aren't any cordless phones, microwaves, or other wireless devices nearby that could interfere with your wireless signal.  This is most prominent on devices operating near the 2.4 Ghz range, but could be other wireless devices.  \nAlso, you may want to try changing the channel on your router because other wireless networks nearby could be interfering.  You can access this setting by going to your router setup page (usually http://192.168.2.1, but check your user manual) and finding the wireless channel setting.  For your router, it appears to be under Wireless -> Advanced, but again, check your manual.  \nIf all else fails, I'm afraid you're best off taking another trip to the Genius Bar and seeing what they can do for you.\n\nA: Though it's only been a couple hours since I did the update, this system update does seem to have dramatically reduced the losing wifi connection issue\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4764\nTime Machine backup of over 1GB just successfully completed, so I think I'm out of the woods.\n", "Q: How can I fix iPhoto 11 print quality My wife scrapbooks our photos, and has recently upgraded from her old computer to a brand new MacBook Pro.  She is a big fan of \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\", so has been using iPhoto 6 on MacOS 10.4.11 on her old computer.  She now has iPhoto 11 on MacOS 10.6.8.\nThe problem is when she goes to print a photo, the quality is much worse than it used to be.  We are using the same printer (an HP PSC 2175 all-in-one), photo ink, and photo paper as before, and printing the exact same photo, selecting the correct photo paper and \"Best Quality\" in the print settings, and the comparison is laughable.  The overall color is dingy/yellow/darker compared to the old print.\nI'm hoping that there is some setting (or multiple settings) that were introduced or the default value changed inbetween iPhoto 6 and iPhoto 11 that is causing this difference.  Can anyone tell me what I can change to make it print out good photos again?  Or suggest things to try?\nIn the print dialog box, we have already tried changing the \"Color Matching\" preference from \"Vendor Matching\" to \"ColorSync (automatic)\" and that didn't make a noticeable difference.  We looked over the options listed under \"Real Life Digital Photography\", but nothing seemed to jump out at us as a likely fix, and I am reluctant to keep printing out photo ink to try each setting individually.\n-- Update 8/7/2011 --\nI have tried printing the same photo on our Epson Stylus NX420.  We only have plain paper for that printer, but when I select the plain paper / best quality setting, the photo is the correct brightness in the lighter areas, but the other colors have a strong blue tint compared to the original and the HP print.\nI have also printed the same photo on the HP printer from Preview (by dragging the thumbnail to the desktop and then opening that).  That printed out better quality and color matching than the same settings using iPhoto 11 (I tried both plain paper and photo paper, with the appropriate settings), and also had the added benefit of not auto-cropping my 4x6 prints.  However, the pictures were more pixelated than ones printed from iPhoto.  Always something!  :-P  Maybe iPhoto is doing some sort of smoothing filter, and that is why the colors are off?\nI reconsidered my reinstall iPhoto 6 idea (either uninstalling iPhoto 11 or in addition to it).  I have verified that it should work on Snow Leopard, but I know the iPhoto Library is already modified such that iPhoto 6 will not recognize it.  Perhaps I could just have her import the pictures she wants to print into the iPhoto 6 library in order to print them, that wouldn't be terrible if it worked.\n\nA: I'm a big scrapbooker myself when I ordered print I just set PrintSetting to Photo paper and make sure it's in Default Mode when print dialog pop up. Im using HP printer and HP everyday photo paper along with iPhoto '11, iOS 10.6.8.\nIt's turned out really great!!\nHope this help.\n\nA: What is the exact make and model of the printer? How many years old is it? Have you contacted the printer manufacturer to see if they provide updated modern drivers for Mac OS X 10.6?\nHave you tried printing to other makes and models of printers? This is how you can determine whether the problem is with this printer, and its drivers, alone, or if the problem is related to iPhoto '11.\n\nA: You should be able to set the quality of the photo in the print dialog.\n", "Q: Can't print on OS X Lion via shared printer connected to Windows Vista.

Is there any way to get the PDF files to appear there? Seems like if they appear next to the mp3s on the Mac iTunes client, they should appear in the Podcasts screen in iOS.\n\nA: Yes you can do this but the mp3s and PDFs are two distinct things that need to each be setup for syncing separately. \nSo, sync your podcast/mp3s like you always do. Then you need to tell iTunes to sync your PDFs through the books tab when you have your iPhone/iPad plugged in.

I bought a wireless keyboard and mouse at same time. When I started up with ⇧ shift or ⌥ alt/option key down, the computer starts up from the internal drive. No SafeBoot or Startup options.\nWhen I attached a USB keyboard and mouse and started up with the ⌥ alt/option key down, I was able to choose between the internal drive and backups on external drive. The wireless mouse was inactive at this time. When I selected a drive with the USB mouse, it asked me for a password. From that point forward, everything worked normally. The wireless mouse works to move the cursor to the text box and the wireless keyboard works to enter the password.\nI replaced batteries in keyboard and mouse, installed OS X 10.7 Lion, reset NVRAM using USB keyboard - Still same issue.\nThe green light on keyboard comes on momentarily during startup, so the iMac must be communicating with the keyboard. After that, the light goes off and can be turned back on for a few seconds by pressing switch on right side of keyboard. By doing this repeatedly during startup as soon as the light went off, I got the startup options once.\nI checked System Preferences → Bluetooth → Advanced. The first 3 checkboxes are checked. The 1st checkbox is \"Open Bluetooth Setup Assistant at startup if no keyboard is detected\". I never understood this, I assume it indicates that the keyboard is detected. The iMac can be awakened from sleep with keyboard and mouse.\nAny clues?\n\nA: At first I thought that maybe you had a firmware password enabled, but some of the stuff you mentioned doesn't line up (being able to reset the PRAM, and choose a startup disk at least some of the time).\nHave you checked to make sure that you've got all the updates? Specifically, the keyboard firmware updates?\n", "Q: How do I burn my iTunes purchased TV shows onto a playable DVD? I have several tv shows that I purchased on iTunes for my daughters to watch. Rather than have them sit at the desk and watch on my laptop or on the iPad, I  would like to burn the episodes onto a DVD that will be playable in my DVD Player.\n\nA: You probably won't like this answer, but as far as I know, there is no legal way to burn those episodes onto a DVD in a way that is playable in your DVD player. The problem is that the iTunes episodes are encrypted with Apple's FairPlay DRM and DVD players do not know how to decrypt them. In order to make the videos playable in a DVD player, you would need to circumvent the DRM and this is illegal in many countries.\nAs an alternative, you could buy an AppleTV and hook it up to your television. At $99, it is a relatively inexpensive investment, and it would allow you to stream your iTunes shows to your TV while keeping your laptop and iPad free for your own use.\n\nA: You can't, at least not with the standard tools (iTunes, iDVD). This isn't a bug but intended behavior to comply with their licensing requirements.\nYour options are probably:\n\n\n*\n\n*Break the DRM and burn it to DVD.\n\n*Find something that can stream iTunes to your TV.\n\n\nIt looks like there are some projects which attempt to stream iTunes to a Roku, which is not limited to HDMI out. These look pretty rough though.\n\nA: Legality issues as mentioned by the previous reply, but you could use a screen recorder, like ScreenFlow to capture the video playback.  Downsides:  Quality will be reduced, filesizes will be large relative to the quality, you have to capture in real time.  \nNot an ideal solution, but better than nothing.\n\nA: The bottom line is that the TV networks and production companies that make the TV shows and the movies that they sell through iTunes do not want you to make DVDs from your iTunes purchases. This is because they also make money from selling physical DVD collections of TV shows that you can buy or rent through companies like Best Buy, Amazon, Blockbuster or Netflix. That is why iTunes has no capability to make DVDs out of digital downloads--the TV networks would not permit Apple to provide this feature, according to the licensing and sales contracts between the TV networks and Apple.\nSecondly, making a DVD from any kind of digital video is a complicated process that requires knowledge of video editing and requires a lot of input and work from the user to create one. So what you are trying to do would be far more trouble than it is worth, and if you are not an expert video editor, the resulting DVDs would most likely be of very poor image quality.\nI second glorifiedHacker's suggestion that you buy an AppleTV. But the new AppleTV will only work with a flat-panel television with an HDMI digital video input. It will not work with any older TVs that only have analog video input. So see if your televisions are compatible with that.\n\nA: Would Handbrake work for you? Or what about MPEG Streamclip? Both are free, great video conversion applications\n\nA: I bought the cable that converts iOS device to component RCA cables and plug them into my DVD recorder and record as it's playing.  It's worked fine for me for years.\n", "Q: How to delete OS X Lion installer app I re-downloaded the OS X Lion installer app to burn a DVD.

You'll find them in two locations:\nPreference file:\n/Users/username/Library/Preferences/ca.greyfirst.celtx.plist\n\nPreference folder:\n/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Celtx\n\nI'd do the following to troubleshoot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Celtx. Not a problem, since you can't open it anyway. \n\n*Move the above listed files/folders to your Desktop.\n\n*Try to launch Celtx. If things work, great. Celtx will recreate the preferences. You will need to reset any user preferences you made.\n\n*If things don't work, I'd Trash the application, redownload it, and reinstall.\n\n*After reinstalling, restart your computer before you try to open the app again, just in case anything's being cached\n\n\nOh, and best of luck with your script!\n", "Q: How can I detect that sound is being generated I wish to use a mac mini as a home theatre system.\nI would like the mini to send commands to the power amplifier to turn on/off depending on whether there is any sound generated (like a screen saver but for sound).\nAnyone have ideas on how this can be done?\nUPDATE:\nPower Amp is Cambridge Azur 650R, which can be controlled by IR or RS-232.\nAmp manual says not to keep on at all times, and I wish to conserve energy.\nI am looking for something equivalent to the 'Sleepwatcher' utility (for the display, that I will use with my projector), but which works for sound.\nI have found that the HALLab utility, from apple's XCode developer kit, can show that sound is 'Running somewhere', so it's possible in software.\nAnyone know of a tool that uses this?

I didn't find any ready-made products, but it wouldn't be too hard for any electronics hobbyist with some analog experience, I think (here's a design I found, for example; it could probably also be done with a single microcontroller, especially if the amplifier has an IR remote control).

I have read on a few pages that it might.  But I don't know if it really does and if it supports more than just videos and Pictures. \nIf I use an iPhone 4 will it work?\nAgain I am looking for full video out. Not just videos and pictures.  I got the cord that says it is for tv out but it only supports videos, slideshows and selected apps (tv genie).   I am looking for more support than that. \n\nA: Based on your question, I think you might be referring to mirroring, which is only supported by the iPad 2.\nFor other devices, it'll do video out as long as the app itself supports it, as you suggest.\n", "Q: How do I convert FLIC files properly I need to open and convert old Autodesk Animator FLIC (.FLI) files (from MS DOS) into something more useful, like say AVI or even an image sequence. I realize both Motion and QuickTime \"can\" do this, but they mess up the films, probably because of a faulty decoder. \nI've already downloaded the UNIX app xnview, but it doesn't work well. While it can handle the format well, it can only store one frame at a time as a standalone picture, which is PAINFUL to do when there are usually several hundred frames in any given animation.\n\nA: I don't know what you can do about converting the files....

In Lion, a document's version history is normally accessed by clicking the arrow next to a document's name in the title bar. However, the title bar does not appear when an app is put into fullscreen mode. Is it possible to access the Versions interface while in full screen? \nOr am I completely missing something...\n\nA: Oddly, and in my opinion, not a great solution by Apple from the user interface consistency standpoint, the answer is both Yes and No.\nThere are a limited number of fullscreen-enabled apps available at this time, but with the ones I tried (Pages, Keynote, and Preview), you cannot directly access the standard Versions interface while in fullscreen for the reason you mention: no access to the title bar. When the title bar is available, to get to Versions, you would normally click the arrow next to the document title and choose Browse All Versions. \nHowever, in fullscreen mode, once you have saved a version (File > Save a Version), choosing File > Revert to Saved drops the app out of fullscreen, then invokes the Versions interface. It's the functional equivalent to choosing Browse All Versions from the title bar. Once you click the Done button in the Versions interface, the app returns you into fullscreen mode.\n", "Q: OS X Lion, Safari: could not turn off antialiasing I had the antialiasing disabled in Safari (5.0?) in Snow Leopard, by setting\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari AppleAntiAliasingThreshold -int 200\n\nNow I have OS X Lion with Safari 5.1, and that option does not work anymore. How should I disable antialiasing in Safari 5.1?\n\nA: It looks like the code to handle that was stripped out finally in May, 2011. It conflicted with the new way of drawing and it's not clear if we can influence the threshold in the same way.\nIt might be best to ask / file a bug against WebKit which drives Safari's rendering.\nTo me, the new code works so much better, I don't need the speedup or the control.\nSee http://www.ichemlabs.com/618 for details, but here is the nice chemical rendering that shows the differences between the old and new default behavior. Full size, it's impressive how much better the rendering is at the same (or better) rendering speed.\n\n", "Q: Can you list Mail attachments separately rather than as icons in the text? In Mail, is it possible to show attachments in a separate list (like in Entourage) rather than as icons buried within the text?\n\nA: The following command can be entered into terminal to disable the inline display of Mail's Attachments:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes\n\nto restore the original functionality, use this:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool no\n\n\nA: I'm not sure how Entourage shows attachments.  However, in 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and earlier, you can view all of the attachments in one place by clicking the triangle disclosure arrow next to the paper clip icon below the headers in the message view.  They will still show as icons, but this shows all of the attachments in one place.  The attachment icons will also continue to be shown inline in the text.\nIn 10.7 (Lion), this button stays below the headers, but moves to the right side of the screen.  Click and hold and it will list all the attachments in a pull-down menu.  Again, the icons will continue to be shown inline in the text.\n\nA: I have had the same \"problem\" and I have found two possible solutions for this. One, you can use the terminal command that, however, would only sort out the outgoing e-mails (for some it would not be a problem, but I have had PDFs coming in that would slow down my mail.app'. Two, there is an app called \"Attachment tamer\" where you can pretty much adjust any aspect in relation to e-mail attachments. Nevertheless, it costs 15 $. So, after a couple of hours I have found out a solution that works for both, outgoing and incoming mails, and does not cost anything. The \"magic\" app is called \"TinkerTool\" and it only does take two clicks and two reboots to have all the attachments displayed as symbols only. Download the App - install it - run it - tab: applications - check the 6th box from the top. And it is for free. Additionally, it has many other features which you can use. Enjoy ;-)\nMarek \n\nA: Right Click on the attachment and choose View As Icon.

I wanted to let the server do DHCP and and let the AEBS do NAT but apparently the AEBS doesn't allow it (I've tried this workaround but it didn't work for me) so the plan was to experiment with setting the AEBS as a dumb bridge and let the server do DHCP and NAT.\nThe DHCP portion seemed to work fine (Server Admin tool is showing the DHCP clients) but NAT just won't start.\nWhen I click on START in the GUI or try from the command line (serveradmin start nat), I get this:\nAug  5 00:18:24 helios servermgrd[4310]: servermgr_nat: nat config:\n                    Error:Could not create Mobile Internet Sharing config}\n\n\nA: OP Here.\nI got it working by making my mini the gateway and making the AEBS a dumb access point (plugged into an internal-facing ethernet port), and also enabling the internet sharing on the mini.\n\nA: Had exactly the same problem with 10.7.5, and all I could Google was this (and the exact copy over at Apple), and an article in Czech\nLong story short: the Czech article led me to 'pf' which led, via apple discussions, to this:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5215?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nInstructions for setting it up by hand.

Now, it shows the very bottom of the menu meaning you would see the \"Open in Finder\" option after you click it. Now, I sorted my download folder by \"Date Added\" and its very annoying that I am seeing the oldest files first rather than the newest ones. I would have to scroll all the way to the top to access the new files. How can I have the newer files be shown first aka ascending order?\n\nA: In my Downloads stack I don't have this problem. The ordering is correct, i.e. latest download appears at the bottom.\nThe settings which achieve this are:\nSort by: Date Added\nDisplay as: Stack\nView content as: Fan\nI hope these settings work for you too.\n\nA: My downloads folder is a stack with latest downloads appearing at the top without me having to move the slider. When I 'right' click the downloads folder icon in the dock, a contextual menu appears.\n\nA: I had mine set to List as well and noticed the problem right away after upgrade (my Downloads folder is huge). \nI think this is a bug. The grid view has the correct initial position (at the top of the reverse chronological ordering)\nI suspect we'll need to switch to grid view until a patch comes along. :(\n\nA: Try this in the Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock use-new-list-stack -bool YES\n\nThis gives you another type of List view that always starts at the top of the list with the latest files.

A work around is to press control-commnd-up arrow and this will bring you to the top of the list.\n", "Q: Upgrade Snow Leopard Server to Lion Server. What problems should I expect to arise? Is upgrading as simple as installing Lion Server from the App store? I've heard that you have to be running Lion first to be able to install the Lion Server software, but I'm looking at upgrading a live server and need to know how others have gone about it and the problems they ran into. Thanks :0)\n\nA: Well, I would advice clearly against doing this for a live system at the moment. Don't fix it if it isn't broken.\nLion Server has a completely revamped UI, it takes quite a bit of time to reconnect all the bits and pieces. It does a lot under the hood which used to be exposed in Server Admin.\nDNS / DHCP / other low level services are still available, but not exposed in the default UI anymore.\nSet aside a separate machine, learn to find your way in the new UI, and then you may choose to upgrade your live system or not.\n\nA: I upgraded to OSX Lion server 10.7.2 from Snow Leopard server with no problems.\nI purchased to server upgrade: it tried to install immediately, warned me that I did not have Lion, told me I had already purchased Lion (which I had installed on a macbook previously).\nThen nothing appeared to happen. While I was looking for advice on sites like this, after about 20 minutes the 'Do you want to install Mac OS X\" screen popped up.\nLion must have been downloading in the background!\nOn selecting 'Continue', it started 'downloading additional components' with a forecast of 3 hours 52 minutes. This reduced a minute at a time for 3 minutes, then forecast 32 minutes.\nAfter 29 minutes total (from the start) it rebooted to server, configured services, upgraded OD to 10.7.2, upgraded users, upgraded services\nThat took 6 minutes. (35 minutes from the start) it rebooted again, prompted to configure iCloud.\nNo settings were lost. VPNs, share points and shared screens were preserved. (But I had to restart screen sharing on a client that was active during the reboots, not a big deal)\n\nA: I've been holding off upgrading after reading the apple documentation and finding that some features available in Snow Leopard Server won't be available in Lion Server.\n\nA: Don't upgrade just yet. Wait at least for 10.7.1.\nThat said, the upgrade is pretty straight forward. If you go to the Mac App Store on the Server and try to buy Lion, it'll tell you, you need to buy the server components too. Do that and then it'll download the two packages and upgrade to Lion Server in one go.\nAfter the upgrade you'll be surprised to find only a very simplified Server Admin app. You need to download the 10.7 server admin tools (the one you're used to) from Apple as they don't come preinstalled anymore (i wonder why). You get them here.\n", "Q: Album art on my iOS device differs from Mac iTunes Roughly 20% of the time now, the song or podcast currently playing on my iPhone 3GS will display some completely random album art from another title in my library of 9967 songs, 19 podcast subscriptions. Songs can have podcast covers and vice-versa.\nUnlike the answer suggested by \nWhy doesnt my iPod show album art?, when I cross-check the Artwork tags of my Mac's iTunes (anything from 8.x through 10.4), I can verify that the songs with mistaken artwork on-device have the correct artwork on-Mac and that songs without artwork on-Mac display the generic \"no artwork\" icon on-device.\nI've had this problem almost as long as I've had my 3GS. In the past couple months, my wife has also reported this symptom with completely separate hardware/software (both her own Mac and iPhone 3GS, neither of which migrated any settings from my machine).\nCorrectly-configured artwork should show as intended on-device. How can I restore the expected behavior?\n\nA: I had the exact same problem several times in the last three years (with an iPhone 3G, an iPhone 4 & an iPod touch).\nI always solved it this way :\n\n\n*\n\n*disable music syncing for the device (uncheck everything in the \"music\" tab)\n\n*sync the device at least two times\n\n*enable music syncing\n\n*sync again\n\n\nI usually divide steps 3 & 4 in smaller steps. I begin by syncing a few artists to check everything is fine before syncing all the music I want on my device.\nI hope this will work for you.\n\nA: You may have already tried this but just in case - do a complete factory restore on your iPhone. Do not let it use the backup of your data, you want everything fresh from iTunes. Also it may be possible to rebuild the iTunes internal photo database. (I know that you can ask iPhoto to rebuild but I am not sure if one can do the same on iTunes.)\n\nA: I've had pretty much the same symptoms with cover art when I first got my iPhone 3GS.\nDo you have the option \"covert songs to 128 kBit/s AAC\" (I don't know the exact wording, my iTunes is in german) ticked in the first iPhone tab on iTunes?\nI had it ticked back then. And as soon as I unticked and resynced everything, those problems with the cover art were gone. \nOf course it might be something completely different in your case, I just wanted to let you know what did the trick for me :))\nGood luck getting your cover art back to normal, I know how annoying that is...\nAnna\n", "Q: Why do I see two sizes for storage space available? I have an SSD-based MacBook Pro running Lion, with Time Machine active. I'm aware of the difference between base-10 and base-2 storage sizing, but cannot explain the discrepancy between what Finder reports as available space and what's labeled as free space in the Storage tab of System Information:\n\nShouldn't they both be using decimal units and therefore agree on one of these two numbers?\n\nA: Having Time Machine active is probably the cause for the difference between the two reported sizes.\nFor example:\nFinder tells me I currently have 55.53GB of freespace on my SSD.\nSystem Information tells me there's 44.22GB.\nSystem Information also tells me 11.31GB are being used for Backups.\n44.22GB + 11.31GB = 55.53GB\nIn Lion, Time Machine will keep Backups on the local drive in addition to the external drive. This is useful for notebooks as you are able to make use of Time Machine without needing to have the external drive with you.\nI would guess the oldest backup files get removed once you need the space for something else, which is why Finder doesn't report those backups as taking up any space.\n", "Q: How many CPUs can be assigned to a Parallels Desktop VM? I have an iMac with the quad core i7 CPU which shows up in Mac OS X as an eight core CPU (thanks to Hyper Threading, I think). Parallels Desktop allows me to assign 1-8 cores to the Windows VM that I'm running. How would changing that number affect the Host OS performance? Currently I have 2 cores assigned to the VM, but it is unclear how Parallels manages them. Are those the real cores or the virtual cores? I always see only 4 cores being used in Mac OS X, the remaining 4 (I guess those are the virtual ones) never show any activity.\nFor example - can I assign all 8 cores to the VM and still use Mac OS X? Say I'd like this for gaming (w/o going to Boot Camp), etc.\nOr if I assign 3 cores, 5 cores - real processors always have either 1 or some even number of cores.\n\nA: You have a lot of cores, and hyperthreading makes it appear to the system that you have twice as many. The reason you may not ever see activity on half your cores is because the system is not utilizing them. While the system may be multiprocessor aware, not necessarily will every application you run. Today's processors are very very fast, which means that most of your cores will sit idle most of the time unless you're doing something really really interesting.\n\nIf you want to see your cores being utilized, try this google search, which returns multicore aware Mandelbrot set generators. Another suggestion is to try downloading HandBrake and installing and setting it to transcoding some large wmv9 files with deblock and denoise, set to maximum for good measure, but don't expect nice transcodes with those settings; its just something for your cores to chew on so you can watch in Activity Monitor that you can set processes that will use all cores. If you're not satisfied, run multiple instances of these applications. What I used to do to see the cores utilized is launch a ridiculous number of Chess.app instances and set them all to playing against the computer. If you want to try this, have /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app open, and open  /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app and enter this line, hit return, hit the up arrow and repeat over and over until you think you have enough instances running to work your processors,:\n /Applications/Chess.app/Contents/MacOS/Chess &\n\n\nRegarding Parallels, I searched the forums and the documentation. Interestingly, neither the User Guide, nor the Data Sheet, nor any list of features that I could find say anything about how many cores you can assign to each VM. I believe this may be to how things get created in parallel, and while there were issues with multicore in previous versions (if the number of forum posts regarding it are any indication), perhaps they decided to move forward with publishing documentation sans any mention of the abilities to utilize multiprocessor/multicore. \n\nThat being said, I found some other sources for you that answer your question \n\nHow many CPUs can be assigned to a Parallels Desktop VM?\n\ndefinitively:\n\n\n*\n\n*according to a wikipedia page comparison between Fusion and Parallels:\n\n\n\nUp to 8 processors per VM & Multi Core\n\n\n\n*\n\n*according to lowendmac\n\nIn comparison, Fusion 5 and the current version of Parallels support up to 8 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*according to macworld\n\nBoth Windows and Linux guest operating systems can be installed via an easy installer, and Parallels supports up to eight virtual CPUs, and 64-bit versions of Windows and Mac OS X Server.\n\nPlease bear in mind this last citation is for Parallels 5, which should be good news, as subsequent versions of Perallels will only increase the features and hopefully the robustness of the application. \n\nFWIW, while I have switched to Open Source software for virtualization, I was an early adopter of Parallels and found their support to be excellent. They took good care of me and answered all of the many questions and problems I encountered in timely fashion. That was some time ago (~2005/6 during beta, and the release of 3.0), and I have heard complaints since then, but that was not my personal experience with their forums or their phone support. So I have encouraged others to register and seek help and answers to technical questions there. I would recommend you do this to hear from the source exactly what you want to know regarding how Parallels handles multiprocessing/multicore.\n\ncan I assign all 8 cores to the VM and still use Mac OS X? \n\nYes, absolutely, OS X is very good at handling resources. It is possible you may not even notice much is happening. I have myself a rather anemic (by today's standards) core2duo, and with 15 instances of HandBrakeCLI running transcodes, and both my puny cores maxed out, I really couldn't notice anything from the desktop while I continued to surf and use other day to day applications. I did keep an eye on how much memory was being used, and I didn't even get close to maxing my 8GB of RAM, nor did I notice any swapping. But if you have a slow (4200 rpm) harddrive, I think you'll probably notice something.\n\nA: Parallel support sent me this\nConsidering that 1 vCPU is equal to 1 CPU is an assumption for the sake of simplification, since vCPUs are scheduled on logical CPUs which are hardware execution contexts. These tasks can take a while in the case of a single core CPU, CPUs that have only 1 thread per core, or could be just a thread in the case of a CPU that has hyperthreading.\nConsider this scenario:\nIn the physical world you can run Windows 2003 Standard Edition on up to 8 cores (using a 2-socket quad-core box) but in a virtual machine they can only run on 4 cores because it tells the operating system that each CPU has only 1 core per socket.\n", "Q: How do I find out what application is trying to wake my MBP? my mac book pro is refusing to stay asleep. I noticed it will wake up roughly every thirty minutes and display the screensaver password screen and even when the lid is closed I will be able to hear it wake and then go back to sleep quite regularly. I installed please sleep but that didn't fix it either. another curious thing I noticed was that sometimes when waking the mbp from sleep it will not let me type anything into the username/password fields. only closing the lid and reopening it after a few seconds will fix this. \nI'm running 10.6.7 on a 17\" 2.66ghz mbp i7 with 8gb ram.\nmy question is this: how do I find out which app is trying to constantly wake up my system? (wake for networks access is disabled.)\n\nA: Macs will wake up in response to many hardware events. Changing a USB/Firewire/Thunderbolt cable or even plugging in / powering on a connected device will wake Macs that are sleeping. Keyboard presses, clamshell sensor detecting an open of the display lid will also wake up a sleeping Mac. These are pretty well known and obvious, even if you don't realize a pet or power fluctuation can cause a wake event.\nTwo software items will also wake a sleeping mac and both rely on the power management / system management controller. Both are seen in the Energy Saver preference pane. This is how applications can do the same thing as hardware and wake your mac.\n\nFor macs with a battery - the power adapter needs to be connected and powered for much of this to work. The Wake for network access is both the standard WakeOnLan (WOL) as well as Apple's Bonjour Sleep Proxy. I like the article About Wake on Demand that explains how Apple has extended the concept of WOL and made a service.\nIf you disable these two items - software can no longer wake your sleeping mac and you can know if it's a hardware event or a software event. The other answers go into how to look at the logs to know which event has made a specific wake up request. Hopefully this helps frame the bigger picture of how your mac can take a cat nap with one eye open.\n\nA: One way would be to have /Application/Utilities/Console.app running and when you MBP awakes, check the logs. It will normally log a reason for wakeup, e.g.\n06/08/2011 13:42:39.000 kernel: Wake reason: EHC1\n06/08/2011 13:42:39.000 kernel: The USB device HubDevice (Port 1 of Hub at 0xfd000000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (2)\n06/08/2011 13:42:39.000 kernel: The USB device Keyboard Hub (Port 2 of Hub at 0xfd100000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (3)\n06/08/2011 13:42:39.000 kernel: The USB device Apple Keyboard> (Port 2 of Hub at 0xfd120000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (3)\n\n\nA: I think you'll need further info to proceed. Have you checked the console log for status messages? Also, do you have any peripherals/USB hardware items attached? If so, reboot without them and see if the problem persists.\n", "Q: Can Mail.app be configured to insert a blank line before the text of the previous message in a reply?

If you want to automatically perform some sort of additional work related to the working directory, you should customize the shell with a startup script that performs some command with $PWD.\nAssuming you're using bash (the default), what you apparently would want to do is add something like this in ~/.bashrc:\ncd \"$PWD\"\n\nI'm not familiar with rvmc, but I assume it must use the shell startup script to customize the \"cd\" command, so be sure to issue this command after that. Also, if you don't already have shell startup scripts, you'll usually want to create ~/.bash_profile and have it run ~/.bashrc if it exists (look around on StackExchange or use Google to find this common idiom).\n\nA: Try upgrading your installation of RVM if you are running something older than 1.6.10 (check your active version with rvm --version).\nIn some shell:\nrvm get latest\n\nThen, either restart your other, existing shells, or run rvm reload in them.\nNote: Another problem the OP faced was PATH manipulation after RVM was loaded into the shell. This created the “right gemset selected, but wrong installation of ruby” effect that disappeared after “cd out, cd in” (since RVM would have reasserted its position in the PATH at that point). When a shell is started in a directory that contains an .rvmrc it is vital that RVM be the last thing to prepend elements to the PATH (at least any PATH elements that might contain a ruby (etc.) so that the Ruby installation selected in the .rvmrc will be effective).\n\nRVM arranges to source .rvmrc files by “hooking” your shell’s cd command (a cd shell function in bash, an entry in chpwd_functions for zsh). Normally this lets it catch any “normal” cd command that you type it or run via a sourced script after loading RVM.\nI do not have Lion to test with, but I suspect the way it works is that Terminal forks, calls chdir(2), then execs your shell to establish your new shell’s initial working directory. This means that the directory is already established by the time RVM is loaded in your shell initialization file.\nThe history seems a bit muddy, but RVM has had some support for sourcing the .rvmrc file in the shell’s initial working directory when it is first loaded. It looks like maybe it was intended to be screen-specific, but in RVM commit cb649ba (Always load the .rvmrc if in an interactive shell (open new tab in same dir)., 2011-05-14) relaxed the requirement so that it should source .rvmrc files for any interactive shell when RVM is first loaded. This commit was first present in the 1.6.10 release of RVM. The code has changed a bit since then, but it still works in (more or less) the same way in the latest versions.\n\nA: I know its not a \"fix\", but you can exit the terminal with command+option+q it will quit without saving the path information.\nOr you can use iTerm2 ( http://www.iterm2.com/ ), it have a few better things than default terminal .\n\nA: Fix 1:\nOkay found the better solution. So I created a script named .loadrvmrc and which only contained \"cd ./\" (also chmod +x it)\nI then loaded it in my .bash_profile, BUT take note that it should be loaded in order.\nFirst, load your .bashrc:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nthen your path(which loads rvm:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/Users/eumir/.rvm/bin:$PATH\n\nand THEN the .loadrvmrc script:\nsource ~/.loadrvmrc\n\nVoila! You can close your terminal and open it with all your tabs and all their respective .rvmrcs.\n===========\nFix 2: (non-programmatic)\nI have fixed it for now. Maybe it's a timing issue for rvm or bashrc, so I'm not sure. If someone can post a better fix/answer for this one please do so and I'll change the accepted answer for this question.\nAnyway in the default Terminal, I just changed Terminal > Preferences > Settings and then checked Startup and added cd ./ as the startup script.\nThis is still ugly for me as starting the terminal will result with \nLast login: Tue Aug  9 11:43:06 on ttys003\neumir$ cd ./\nUsing /Users/eumir/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180 with gemset mygemset\neumir$ \n\nwhich is kinda acceptable(until a better solution comes along).\n", "Q: If I'm not a gamer, what are the reasons I might need a higher-end GPU? I'm buying a 27\" iMac and having trouble understanding why I may need a higher-end GPU over the next 4-5 years (intended usage).  I do lots of picture editing (Photoshop, Lightroom), movie playing (1080p on an external monitor), and some small time video editing with iMovie.  Is it superfluous to upgrade to the higher end gpu for my purposes?\n\nA: For your current needs, the higher end GPU will speed things up a bit, but won't be absolutely essential.  However, upgrading your GPU now will make your iMac a bit more future-proof, allowing it to continue to run applications like these at a decent performance level in the future, as they will need more power as time progresses.\n\nA: It is possible to have the graphics card do computation that is used for image editing. The Quartz image engine and Core Image make use of it. I cannot tell you to what extend, though, or whether having the CPU do mainstream computation will become a common feature in the next couple of years.\nHowever, I doubt that Adobe programs make any use of these APIs. Adobe's creativity suite works on various platforms, and the only portable cross-platform way of image computation is in the CPU. \nLong story short: I doubt that, if you stay with Adobe, you'll get anything out of your GPU. If you switch to OSX software like Aperture and Pixelmator, there you'll get something. \n\nA: I do think that the graphics upgrade would be superfluous.\nYou don't say whether or not you plan to get an SSD for the 27\" iMac. That will provide much more of a visible speed boost than a graphic subsystem upgrade.\nGiven your described usage, I don't think that there's a very compelling reason for you to spend the money to upgrade to the Radeon HD 6970M over the standard Radeon HD 6770M. And even less reason to spend the extra money for the graphics RAM upgrade for the 6970M.\nAll current Apple desktops and notebooks ship with more than enough graphics power to handle programs like Final Cut Pro X.\nSome Adobe products, including Photoshop, have been using the GPU processor in the graphics card, via OpenGL, to speed operations since the CS4 release. See this Adobe Knowledge Base article for a description of what features use the GPU.\n\nA: Check out the minimum requirements for Final Cut Pro X: \n\n\n*\n\n*OpenCL-capable graphics card or Intel HD Graphics 3000 or later\n\n*256MB of VRAM\n\n\nI think if your graphics card meets these minimum requirements, that would be a good rule of thumb to make sure you are getting something that will continue to be useful for some years to come, with many different software programs.\n\nA: If your going to have it for 4-5 years, i suggest getting the highest possible specs to future-proof your machine. Who knows, apple might imliment OpenCL to do many tasks, and the gnu might help\n", "Q: What is the MAX pixel estate I can get from a MBAir 2011 with multiple displays? I intend to buy a MBAir 11 and need lots of pixels.\nthe more I have the better. If I could have 4 30' screen I'd do it.\nGraphic performance is of absolutely no interest to me, as I only do programming and bloomberg.\nWhat is the configuration that gives the most pixel estate ?\n\nA: As has been said in the other answer, you are restricted to a single external display with the built-in hardware.\nYou can however add extra external displays using USB based display adapters. For example I use one of the DisplayLink adapters. Some of the DisplayLink adapters can do 2048x1152. There will be a limit to how many USB adapters make sense, before you start saturating the USB bus. But it should be fine for a couple of extra displays.\nUSB based adapters aren't well suited to 3D gaming and full screen video, but should be fine for what you want.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the integrated Intel graphics hardware in the MacBook Air does not support multiple external displays. You would be limited to the built-in display plus a single external display.\n\nA: The Thunderbolt port on the MacBook Airs supports one external display. You can use that with a Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter to run a 30\" screen (2560x1600). @andynormancx mentioned DisplayLink adapters and that some can do 2048x1152; the Air has 2 USB ports, so let's say that you can run two of that size of monitor with them (you may be able to squeeze more in there). Finally, there's the internal display (the 11\" has 1366x768; if you want bigger, the 13\" is 1440x900).\nIn total, you're looking at 2560*1600 + (2048*1152)*2 + 1366*768 = 9,863,680 pixels. Is that big enough?\n\nA: There's an adapter from mini-DisplayPort to dual-HDMI, so that would give you (internal display)+2*1920x1080. As others have said, though, your best bet at achieving as many pixels as possible is an additional external graphics adapter, such as TripleHead2Go.\n\nA: If you want both, screen estate and mobility, wait for Thunderbolt-equipped Mac Pros. Keep all of your data on the MacBook Air and connect it to the Mac Pro using Thunderbolt Target Disk Mode. One of the downsides will be that you’ll have to reboot when switching between working at the desk and on the road.\nOn the other hand you’ll have lots of RAM, faster processors, internal backup disks, and all the pixels you need.\n", "Q: How to disable Safari's new \"feed://\" redirection for feeds? I'm sure some people really love that new feature, but I use Google Reader so it's driving me batty. Not to mention that as a tech guy, I might want to actually view an XML feed once in a while (like for instance, Sparkle update feeds).\nSo how do I stop Safari from redirecting the normal XML feeds to their \"feed://\" pseudo-protocol?\n\nA: Apparently, it used to be possible in Tiger/Safari 2.0 to disable this using defaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSyndicationEnabled -bool NO. (source) I cannot get this to work in Lion/Safari 5.1, however.\nYour best bet seems to be to set the default feed reader (Safari → Preferences… → RSS) to something that gives you XML source.\n\nA: Just in case that would be useful, disable RSS feed in Safari 5 :\nSafari top menu --> Preferences --> RSS --> uncheck both boxes next to \"automatically update articles in\"\nDone.\n", "Q: Preview.app: easily print current page only? When printing a PDF from preview, is there an easy way to only print the currently displayed page? Now, I look up the page number and enter it two times in the page range. But maybe there is a keyboard shortcut to do so?\n\nA: In the version of Preview included in Lion, this is easy. Go to File-> Print...\nClick the Show Details button to reveal extra options.\nUnder Pages, choose Selected Page in Sidebar.\nThat will print only the current page (and the live print preview will update to show you).\nNote that the side bar does not have to be visible for this to work.\n\nA: Preview under Snow Leopard (10.6) has a \"Print Selected Page..\" under its File menu (or option-command-P).  This works regardless of showing the Sidebar or not.\n", "Q: Battery life on a core i7 Macbook Air I recently purchased one of the new core i7 Macbook Airs and in most respects its amazing.  The one problem is that the battery life is far less than the \"up to 7 hours\" Apple claims.  In moderate usage, no flash or video, it lasts about 2.5 hours, maybe.   I use the istat menu monitoring tool and don't see much CPU usage, the fan isn't running constantly, and poking around with the Activity Monitor doesn't show anything unusual, so I'm pretty sure I don't have any rogue processes running.   I have flash disabled in Safari, so I don't think that's the culprit either.\nMy questions are...\nWhat battery life do other Macbook Air owners see?   I'm guessing a trip to the genius bar is in my future, has anyone seen similar problems?  If you have, do the support guys give you a new laptop, replace the battery, or tell you there's nothing they can do?\n\nA: I have the same Air as you and I am getting 5-6 hours. So not to much off of what the advertised amount is. Your battery sounds faulty to me.\nThe last computer I had had a faulty battery. It was replaced for free and within a couple of days. Back then they simply replaced the battery on the MB because it was removable. Chances are now they will give you a new laptop because the battery on the Air is harder to remove. You might be without a computer for a few days though. I don't know what they do in other countries, but in Spain they just took it and mailed it to Holland to get fixed and then mailed it back.\n\nA: Sounds like a faulty battery, as Apple's advertised battery life has been pretty accurate lately.  Considering that you're well within your warranty, a trip to the Genius Bar sounds like a great idea, and they should be able to give you a hand.\n\nA: Do you have any sort of online backup system like Crashplan installed ? If so that will quickly drain your battery.\nI have Crashplan and I always completely turn it off when going to battery power.\n\nA: Check your battery condition by Option-clicking the battery menulet.\n\n\nA: Turn off the backlight of the keyboard and that should add a significant amount of time per charge.\n", "Q: How to add characters to the press and hold character picker in OS X Lion? In OS X Lion, there is a very useful feature for people like me who need to write in multiple languages, which pops up a small menu of additional characters when you hold down a letter.\nFor instance, when I hold down the letter E, I get:\n\nThis is great when I'm writing in French for example. However right now I need to write something in Czech; however, the Czech letter ě (looks like the 3rd letter in the popup with the accent flipped) does not appear in the popup.\nIs there a way to tell OS X to include Czech or other additional characters in those popups?\nNote: I do not want to use the Czech keyboard layout; I found switching layouts for each language is somewhat unpractical.\n\nA: The characters included in the popovers are defined in property lists inside the /System/Library/Input\\ Methods/PressAndHold.app/ bundle.\nI was able to change à to y by editing /System/Library/Input\\ Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist and logging out and back in.\n(note the escape in \"Input Method\" if you're copy pasting)\n<key>Roman-Accent-a</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>Direction</key>\n    <string>right</string>\n    <key>Keycaps</key>\n    <string>a y á â ä æ ã å ā</string>\n    <key>Strings</key>\n    <string>a y á â ä æ ã å ā</string>\n</dict>\n\n\n\nA: If you are using macOS Sierra, you need to look elsewhere to change it. Here are my instructions, inspired from Custom Characters in OS X Accent Popup - George Garside:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable System Integrity Protection as detailed in How to turn off rootless in Mac OS X El Capitan - MacWorld.\n\n*Navigate to /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/PlugIns/PAH_Extension.appex/Contents/Resources/ in the Finder. To go to it quickly, press ⇧⌘G and paste the string in.\n\n*Find your keyboard plist file. If you are using the English layout, you would be looking at Keyboard-en.plist and if you are using the German layout it would be Keyboard-de.plist. It could have other names as well, depending on your keyboard language.\n\n*Back this file up by pressing ⌘D. Rename the copy you made to something with \"backup\" in its name.\n\n*Open up the original file (without backup in its name) and edit the characters you want to in. After that, save it.\n\n*Enable System Integrity Protection as detailed in the same page as step 1.\n\nA: Using the info in this thread I answered the same question on MacRumors. \nI made a custom .plist file specifically for Chinese Pinyin input. So I wanted to link to a plist that is created for Chinese phonetics. You can download it here. \n\nA: My solution (for Czech):\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist file\n\n*Copy /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-cs.plist and rename it to /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist\n\n*Remove useless characters from new /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist\n\nA: I got it to work on OS X 10.11!\nLooks like they changed the location to:\n/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app\n—> Right Click + Show Package Contents\n/Contents/PlugIns/PAH_Extension.appex\n—> Right Click + Show Package Contents\n/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist (or whatever keyboard you use).\nIn there you can click the drop-down arrows, then double click next to \"Keycaps\" and change the keys to your desired keys. \n\nSee, it works!\n\nA: I know this is a little late, but I feel it's an important contribution: you can not only press-and-hold keys to input special characters; you can also input strings of text. For example, I configured my Keyboard-en.plist file so when I hold the \"p\" key, I can choose between my first name (which is pretty long), last name, and email address (which is also long). I feel this might be useful to some people, so this is what it looks like:\n<key>Roman-Accent-p</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>Direction</key>\n    <string>right</string>\n    <key>Keycaps</key>\n    <string>p firstname lastname email</string>\n    <key>Strings</key>\n    <string>p firstname lastname email</string>\n</dict>\n\n", "Q: OS X Lion: App-Specific Resume I know there's a system wide preference to disable 'Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps', but is there any way to have it restore only specific apps?.

Hence, I need to limit the space taken by backups. I see two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition\n\n*Limit the size of the backup sparse bundles.\n\n\nWhich one should I chose? If you say 2.: How to best do that, so it won't take forever? \n\nA: I've been looking at this as well to limit the space a single machine can use when sharing a time capsule (slightly different application, but same concept). Here is what I found:\n\n\n*\n\n*External Drive - The quickest and easiest solution. The backups and data are completely separate and won't interfere with each other. The main disadvantage is having the clutter of extra devices and cables.\n\n*Partition - This is probably the best option to ensure dedicated space for the backups and the other data. As such it is the least flexible if you want to reallocate space at a later date. The other disadvantage is that it is difficult to do in that you aren't able to do it from within the Air Port utility.\n\n*Sparse Bundle Size Limit - At first I thought this would be the best option because it is self-contained within the Time Capsule, is flexible, and not to difficult (though perhaps a bit tedious). However, it seems that there issues with some versions of Mac OS X not respecting the size limit. I am not clear yet on whether this is a bug or a feature. When moving my sparse bundles to a large Time Capsule, at first they all appeared with the smaller size, but then they were resized to the capacity of the larger Time Capsule.\nThose options cover the 'prevention' approach to make sure that no more space is used than allocated. Another approach is to just let it be and then prune backups when needed. This a good way to go if you have a lot of room. I tried this before getting a new Time Capsule but it was just too tight of a squeeze in my case.\n\n\n*\n\n*tmutil - As bmike points out, tmutil can be used to clear out old back ups, but was introduced with Lion so may not be an option for some people.\n\n*Delete Files - You can delete files from a backup by entering Time Machine, browsing to the file or folder, and selecting the option to delete from backup in the gear icon.\n\n*Force Thinning - By artificially increasing the backup space required, you can force Time Machine to run its thinning procedure deleting older backups. I attached a large external drive to my mac and removed it from the exclude list in Time Machine options. This allowed me to clear space from one machine's backup image to make room for the others. It worked, but the downside is that it can take a very long time. I imagine tmutil would do this more efficiently.\n\nA: A third option would be to purchase an external hard drive and attach it to the USB port on the back of the Time Capsule.  \nThis drive could be used exclusively for shared data or backups and would still appear on the network.\nAlso, I do not believe it is possible to partition a drive over the network.\n\nA: For me this is a non-problem.  I have terabytes of data side by side with Time Machine.  Put your files on the disk and let Time Machine do its thing.  Time Machine will happily keep a backup volume almost full, but it always cleans up to make sure there is free space.\nThe exception to this advice is if you are in a mode where you suddenly have to drop gigabytes worth of files onto the volume you might find that Time Machine hasn't left you enough space.\n\nA: Why not script tmutil to prune older backups more aggressively than Time Machine will?\nThe other proposed solutions are hacky or cause you to have a second mount point.\n", "Q: Where is the previous recipients info in Entourage?

The day the new airs came out I decided to switch so I purchased one to replace my well used MB. Lion has had its bugs, most of which aren't to bad, but one thing that is really annoying me is how long it takes the MBA to come out of sleep. I don't know if this is a MBA issue, or a Lion issue in general, but my MBA takes about 5 sec for the keyboard to light up, and then another 5 for the screen to light up. My old MB never took more than 5 sec. I would assume that an SSD would cause things to go lightning fast. What's causing it to take so long? Are there ways to make a computer wake up faster?\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*This happens everyday even after restart\n\n*The time varies slightly, but just being asleep for a few minutes it takes just as long to wake as leaving it asleep all night. \n\n*Typically 4-5 applications open\n\n*Only 50GB of 256 GB HD used, has 4GB of RAM and 1.8Ghz i7 Processor\n\n\nA: sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 should disable \"smart sleep\" mode.\n\nA: Well, the MacBook Air goes one step further than sleep into what Apple calls Standby mode.  This is a deeper form of sleep that uses much less power and takes a bit longer to start up again.  This is how Apple achieves the advertised 30 days on standby.\nhttp://www.apple.com/macbookair/features.html#longlasting\n\nA: Would pmset work? Here's the Apple man page on it.\n", "Q: keyboard preferences ignores modifier key settings I'm using a Windows-type Logitech keyboard with my OS X 10.6.8 iMac. I've always just used the \"Modifier Keys\" setting in the Keyboard pane of System Preferences to reverse the Option and Command keys in order to get the usual Mac key behavior. Recently, however, it seems that these preferences are being ignored. I created a second account for my wife, and even though I swapped the modifier keys in the prefs dialog, the setting is ignored and Windows-style behavior continues. The same setting worked on my account but were ignored on hers (though they stayed as set, as if they were being honored).\nMore mysteriously, I undid those settings on my account while mucking around with a different peripheral, and now when I try to go back to swapped command and option keys, the setting is ignored on my account too! It seems that \"inherited\" pre-10.6.8 settings are honored, but that one can't swap those keys using 10.6.8 and have the system pay any attention.\nIs there some duplicate preference file somewhere I should trash? Any other thoughts?\n\nA: Okay I fixed it. New keyboard (still Windows-style, needing modifier key remapping), uninstalled USB overdrive, moved keyboard from external self-powered USB hub to port in back of second monitor, then back to hub. Modifier key remapping started being obeyed once I'd switched the keyboard to the monitor's USB port, and kept working when I switched back. Go figure!\n\nA: Most likely cause is a mouse driver running in the background that's preventing the settings from saving.  Do you or did you previously have a Logitech or Microsoft mouse?  Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your computer and unplug your mouse.\n\n*Start your computer, with only the keyboard plugged in.\n\n*After the startup process is finished, plug in the mouse and make the changes to the modifier key system preferences.\n\n\nThat should fix it.\n", "Q: App Store is insanely slow on Mac OS X Lion I'm not sure if it is a problem with Lion, but my App Store is insanely slow.\nI Googled and tried the solutions available online, but none of them work.\nAnd I just keep seeing the beach ball.\nOne thing I noticed is, on my Mac, when I click \"see all\" in the App Store, the list of apps first show in 3 columns, and after a while of beach ball, it becomes 4 columns. That's different from other people's video showing slow app store. (in their video, it is automatically 4 columns.)\nHas anyone encountered the same problem? Is there solution available?\n\nA: I'm not aware of a specific problem with this, but generally when I have an issue of an App running slow, I blame corrupt cache/preference files. What I would recommend is using an App like AppZapper. You can use a free trail from: http://www.appzapper.com/downloads/appzapper.dmg which will last for 10 \"zaps\"\nI would recommend you drag App Store.app into AppZapper, and delete all files BUT App Store.app. Do so by UNCHECKING THE BOX beside App Store.app. On the next launch of the Mac App Store, it'll recreate these (possible corrupt) preference/cache files and hopefully fix your slowness problem :)\n\n", "Q: How can I fix broken font-rendering in Safari? On some sites (especially this one) I cannot read certain parts, there are only A's displayed.\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: If the problem persists even after attempting my first solution, try using this command in terminal:\nmv ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist ~/Desktop;\nmv ~/Library/Safari/TopSites.plist ~/Desktop;\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist;\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist.lockfile;\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.RSS.plist;\nrm ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari;\nrm ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.safaridavclient;\nrm ~/Library/Safari;\nmv ~/Desktop ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist;\nmv ~/Desktop ~/Library/Safari/TopSites.plist;\n\nThis will delete all of Safari's (possibly currupt/broken) caches and preferences. In a sense it's like reset Safari to a clean slate. This set of commands WILL backup your bookmarks and top sites, by moving them to your desktop temporarily, and then restore them after deleting the temporary files. YOU WILL LOSE ALL INFORMATION OTHER THAN TOPSITES AND BOOKMARKS.\nJust incase, try manually backing up the ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist ~/Library/Safari/TopSites.plist files.\n\nA: For future reference, please insert screenshots inline with the text using the built in photo uploader. And to answer your question, try restoring your font settings to these default settings:\n\nEspecially pay attentions to the \"Default encoding\" option.\n\nA: You are probably using a third-party font management utility like Extensis Suitcase Fusion or Linotype FontExplorer. These have been widely reported to cause problems with Safari 5.1 in Snow Leopard and Lion.\nDisable your font management utility, then clean the font cache again. Contact the company that makes the font management utility and see if they have a new update to address the problems with Safari 5.1.\n", "Q: Hierarchal folder permissions problems MacOS Snow Leopard and Lion: permissions set for a folder aren't inherited by new files copied into it or created in it. \n\nA: This is actually the correct mode of operation for your OS. This improves the security of the operating system by ensuring that all expanded permissions must be intentionally set, rather than simply inherited. However, you can change this by using Access Control Lists (ACLs) in OS X.\nUsing the Terminal app in Application > Utilities, navigate to the parent folder in question using the cd command. Then, run the following commands:\nchmod -R 774\nchmod +a \"group file_inherit,directory_inherit\" .\n\nThe first commands allow everyone in the folder's user and group to access all files and folders in the directory, and allows people outside the group to read the files. The second sets those permissions to inherit  to all new files and folders within the shared directory.\nFor more information on chmod syntax and man page, look here:\nhttp://ss64.com/osx/chmod.html\nAnd here is a general chmod tutorial:\nhttp://catcode.com/teachmod/\n", "Q: Can you still create an Apple ID with a name that's not an e-mail address? I have an Apple ID that is not an e-mail address(*). When you visit the “Create an Apple ID” page on the Apple ID site though, it says you need to “Enter your primary email address as your Apple ID.” I'm not sure how I got my existing Apple ID that is not an email address, from what I can tell from Apple's FAQ page it may have something to do with MobileMe (though I never had a paid MobileMe account; it could also be from using the Apple Developer Connection site).\nIs it still possible to create a new Apple ID somehow and not use an e-mail address as the ID, or is this a legacy MobileMe option only?\n(*) To clarify: the Apple ID is associated with an e-mail address of course, and that's where my receipts are sent to when I buy something in iTunes (let's say “john.doe@gmail.com”), but my Apple ID username that I use to sign in in iTunes or on the Apple ID page is not that e-mail address at all (let's say it's “cool_john”).\n\nA: It a not possible to create a non-email address Apple ID any longer. \nAs a matter of fact, they are becoming more and more inconvenient, as various Apple services begin to assume that your Apple ID is an email. If you have not started to notice it yet, trust me, you will, soon.\nI recently changed my non-email Apple ID to the linked email address. You can change the username of an Apple ID without starting a new account.\n\nA: I have read that when iTools became .mac, users were grandfathered into .mac and that you could still use your username. I then read the same thing about when .mac became MobileMe. Is your account from back in the iTools days?\nIt's likely that Apple may have allowed usernames not based on email addresses at some point. However, ever since I switched to the Mac (2003) I have not seen this to be the case. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: Where you got an Apple ID with no @:\nBack in the early days of ADC, developer logins were required to be only alphanumeric.  When Apple IDs were introduced, ADC IDs were converted to Apple IDs unchanged. Apple also strongly encouraged developers to request a \"person merge\" of any other Apple ID into this developer Apple ID.\n", "Q: Does disabling auto-correct in Lion also disable spell checking? I found auto-correct incredibly annoying and turned it off soon after installing Lion on July 20th. Auto-correct is fine on a small touchscreen and I can deal with it occasionally correcting to the wrong word, I could not stand it on my real physical keyboard with my Mac.\nSince then, I noticed that I am always having to go to the application's Edit menu -> Spelling and Grammar and check the \"Check Spelling while Typing\" option to get spell check to work and underline misspelled words.\nI know that in iOS, if you disable auto-correct, it also disables spell check. Did Apple really think this was a good idea with Lion too, or is it just something only affecting me?\nUpdate:\nGoing to Sys Prefs -> Language & Text -> Text and changing spelling from \"automatic\" to \"U.S. English\" and restarting seems to have fixed this issue for me for all but one app.\nNotational Velocity seems to still not want to check spelling automatically without me explicitly turning it on from the Edit menu (in that app's preferences, spell checking is set to on). I'm going to assume it's just an incompatibility between Lion and the app. I just installed the nvALT fork and that seems to be working fine.\nGlad to see that Lion didn't actually adopt that \"feature\" from iOS. :)\n\nA: The two settings are independent for me.\nWhat app are you using, where you're continuously forced to turn on spell checking? Most likely it's a bug in that app.\n", "Q: How do I find my IP Address from the command line? I know you can do ifconfig | grep inet, but that shows you several IPv4 addresses. How do I get the specific one for SSHing et al?\n\nA: To get the IP address of your computer facing the Internet, here is a\nworking receipe:\nif=`netstat -nr | awk '{ if ($1 ~/default/) { print $6} }'`\nifconfig ${if} | awk '{ if ($1 ~/inet/) { print $2} }'\n\nIt should work even when you have multiple interfaces active,\neven when you have interfaces you don't know which one is actually the\ndefault gateway.\n\nA: Use ipconfig getifaddr en1 for wireless, or ipconfig getifaddr en0 for ethernet.\nipconfig getifaddr en0 is default for the Wi-Fi network adapter.\nAlternatively you can also do:\ndig -4 TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com\n\nOutput, e.g.:\n172.79.136.120\n\n\nA: I've got this set up in an .aliases dotfile for frequent ip lookup:\nalias ip=\"dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com\"\nalias localip=\"ipconfig getifaddr en0\"\n\n\nA: You can do the following:\nType ifconfig or ifconfig -a. This command shows you the list of interfaces along with their IP and MAC addresses (the latter one only if applicable). You can also type ifconfig en0 or ifconfig en1 for the configuration of a particular interface only (as someone said in their answers, en0 is typically the wired Ethernet while en1 is the WiFi interface). \nAs an alternative, netstat -i will list all interfaces and will show you the IP addresses you have assigned to each of them. \nTypically, when you have SSH daemon running on a box, it will listen on all available interfaces, ie. you can use any IP address that's configured on your machine to connect to that machine via SSH (this, obviously, subject to Firewall rules). If you're after what the OS calls a Primary interface and primary IP address, you can use the scutil command like this: \nMacBook:~ scutil\n> show State:/Network/Global/IPv4\n<dictionary> {\n  PrimaryInterface : en0\n  PrimaryService : C0550F84-5C07-484F-8D62-C8B90DC977D8\n  Router : 10.103.4.1\n}\n> show State:/Network/Interface/en0/IPv4\n<dictionary> {\n  Addresses : <array> {\n    0 : 10.103.4.234\n  }\n  BroadcastAddresses : <array> {\n    0 : 10.103.4.255\n  }\n  SubnetMasks : <array> {\n    0 : 255.255.255.0\n  }\n}\n\nPlease note, that the above, even though is a command-line command, is also interactive (so you run scutil and then enter its own commands into it). The first show command tells you the name of the primary interface for the OS (i.e. this will be the one on top of the list in your System Preferences / Network Preferences window), as well as the IP address of your default router. The second show command takes State:/Network/Interface/<ifname>/IPv4 argument (in this case, en0) and gives you the IP addresses assigned to it. You're looking for the address in the Addresses array, the other two entries are broadcast addresses and the netmasks. \nHope that helps, but if anything is not clear, let me know. \n\nA: To find your Mac's current internal IP address, run:\nifconfig -l | xargs -n1 ipconfig getifaddr\n\nThis is basically equivalent to ipconfig getifaddr en0, but more reliable! en0 is not always the current network interface!\nThank you to @epylinkn in the comments of another answer for this hint.

Over the past year or so I've seen a movement towards switching to Emacs on Mac OS X, often away from TextMate. While I understand the motivation for switching away from TextMate (TM2 is more or less vaporware), I don't really understand the appeal of Emacs. I recognize that it's an extremely powerful editor, but it does not integrate with the operating system very well, uses different key commands than most other applications, and has a heck of a learning curve.\nWith a preponderance of other programmer's text editors on Mac OS X (BBEdit, Sublime Text, Xcode) and some promising upcoming ones (Chocolat, Kod) what is the appeal of Emacs to someone that does not live in a terminal and does not have the muscle memory for it (yet)?\n\nA: Answers to questions like this are likely to be subjective. I tend to disagree that Emacs.app does not integrate well in MacOS. I'm currently using regular Emacs.app from emacsformacosx.com (not Aquamacs) and a few lines in ~/.emacs can easily use familiar shortcuts, e.g. try\n(setq mac-option-modifier nil)\n(setq mac-right-option-modifier 'meta)\n(setq mac-right-command-modifier 'hyper)\n;; M-x to its usual meaning:\n(global-set-key (quote [343144]) (quote execute-extended-command))\n;;  M-p to its usual meaning:\n(global-set-key (quote [332412]) (quote next-history-element))\n\nAlso shortcuts like cmd-O open the regular MacOS file dialog so no need to learn new shortcuts. Incidentally, several common MacOS shortcuts actually come from Emacs (e.g. C-a for beginning-of-line and C-e for end-of-line which are defaults in most MacOS apps like Safari or iWork).\nMain reasons why I use Emacs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Support for virtually any programming language, not just syntax highlighting but also styling, completion of identifiers, automatic indentation (just using TAB in emacs  keeps code clean and prevents a fairly good number of typos/mismatched parentheses etc)\n\n*org mode\n\n*Great support for editing/previewing LaTeX documents using AUCTex\n\n*Workflow compatibility with my desktop, which is a Linux computer\n\n*Powerful tools for software (and not only) development like magit, emerge\n\n*Amazing support in EmacsWiki\n\nA: IMO, if you have a UNIX background with previous experience with Emacs, it might make sense to \"carry it forward\" onto OS X.  As a new text editor, I personally don't think it makes sense.  Yes, it is a fully capable text editor and it can do everything, but as you've said, it does not integrate well into the OS, which for me is a major hurdle.\nI use vim on OS X because its my editor of choice on Linux (where I do much of the work that earns me money), however with that said, I've started learning and using BBEdit.\n\nA: Not really a proper answer, but there are some mac specific bindings in the Cocoa Emacs build that are useful.\nEmacs Cocoa Mac/OS X specific key bindings\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘ + & kill-this-buffer\n\n*⌘ + ' next-multiframe-window\n\n*⌘ + , customize\n\n*⌘ + - center-line\n\n*⌘ + ; ispell-next\n\n*⌘ + shift + : ispell\n\n*⌘ + shift + ? info\n\n*⌘ + shift + C popup-color-panel \n\n*⌘ + shift + D dired\n\n*⌘ + shift + E edit-abbrevs\n\n*⌘ + shift + H do-hide-others\n\n*⌘ + shift + L shell-command\n\n*⌘ + shift + M manual-entry\n\n*⌘ + shift + S ns-write-file-using-panel\n\n*⌘ + shift + ^ kill-some-buffers\n\n*⌘ + ` other-frame\n\n*⌘ + a mark-whole-buffer\n\n*⌘ + c ns-copy-including-secondary\n\n*⌘ + d isearch-repeat-backward\n\n*⌘ + e isearch-yank-kill\n\n*⌘ + f isearch-forward\n\n*⌘ + g isearch-repeat-forward\n\n*⌘ + h ns-do-hide-emacs\n\n*⌘ + j exchange-point-and-mark\n\n*⌘ + k kill-this-buffer\n\n*⌘ + l goto-line\n\n*⌘ + m iconify-frame\n\n*⌘ + n make-frame\n\n*⌘ + o ns-open-file-using-panel\n\n*⌘ + p ns-print-buffer\n\n*⌘ + q save-buffers-kill-emacs\n\n*⌘ + s save-buffer\n\n*⌘ + t ns-popup-font-panel\n\n*⌘ + u revert-buffer\n\n*⌘ + v yank\n\n*⌘ + w delete-frame\n\n*⌘ + x kill-region\n\n*⌘ + y ns-paste-secondary\n\n*⌘ + z undo\n\n*⌘ + | shell-command-on-region\n\n\nA: You can use a OSX GUI Emacs in the form of Aquamacs which is configured to be more OSX like it its key commands and menus and integrates with the OS.\nOne appeal of emacs is because emacs is mainly written in the language (e-lisp) that users can use to extend it there are a lot of scripts that add all sorts of functionality to the editor making it nearly as powerful as an ide. Even configuration is written in the same language so once you learn it you can modify anything you want.\nThe other reason I use emacs is that it runs on several OSs (Windows, Linux, Solaris and OSX ) and so I don't need a different editor for each one as I would if I used BBEdit etc.\n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcuts for \"Compress\" or \"New Folder with Selection\"? Has anybody found a decent solution to this? Custom keyboard shortcuts (as defined in System Preferences > Keyboard) don't work for any dynamic menus like Compress XX items or (new in Lion) New Folder with Selection (XX items) because they add the number of files selected after them. \nAre there undocumented wildcards for keyboard shortcuts?\nUnlike Compress, New Folder with Selection (XX items) does have a default keyboard shortcut, but there still doesn't seem to be a way to change it. \n\nA: For compressing i found simple solution.\nI'm using OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 and It's worked for me.\nOpen system preferences and follow the screenshots:\n--> Step1:\n\n--> Step2:\n\n--> Step3:\n\n--> Step4(It's Done):\n\nThat's It.\nI know it's been long time since you asked the Question but i'm posting the answers for those who are still looking for solution.\n\nA: The shortcut for a new folder with selection is Control + Command + N.\nThere isn't a shortcut for Compress, but you can script it and then assign a shortcut to the script:\nUse AppleScript Editor and refer to this script from Super User on adding a shortcut:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Finder\"\n    tell menu 1 of menu bar item 3 of menu bar 1\n        click (menu item 1 where name starts with \"Compress\")\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: I found it, for Lion:\n- Run Automator\n- create a \"Service\" which compresses a \"file or folder\" for the application \"Finder\"\n- Save the Service with a name like \"Compress\"\n- Go to Preferences -> keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services, and add the Shortcut you want for \"Compress\" under \"Finder\". \n\nThat's it.\n\nA: There aren't any wildcard characters that I am aware of. This is the first I'm running into this problem.\nOne could work around this by using GUI scripting, which refers to menu items by their position in the menu instead of their name.

I'm new here, so I'm not allowed to post a screen grab.\nNo problems in other browsers, or in other apps. Seems to affect all the relatively recent Microsoft \"C\" fonts, but not Arial. I am using Font Explorer X Pro, which has exhibited a bit of post-Lion flakiness, but given it is apparently limited to Safari this is quite possibly irrelevant.\nAnyone else had this problem? Any ideas?\n\nA: This is a known bug that has been reported widely.\nFirst, if you are using a third-party font management program (commonly used by graphic designers with large libraries of fonts) such as FontExplorer or Suitcase Fusion, disable that utility. Contact the publisher of that font utility for information about an update or workaround to deal with Lion and/or Safari 5.1 incompatibility problems.\nSecond, try clearing your font caches. One way to do this is to boot in Safe Mode. Start up and as soon as you hear the startup chime, hold down the Shift key until the operating system starts to load (after the grey Apple logo, when the rotating 12-point clock symbol appears). It will take longer than usual to start up because the Mac will be doing some diagnostic and maintenance work, including deleting your old font caches so the system can build a new one. Once startup is complete, and you are back to the Desktop and Finder, you should restart, because some functions won't work while the Mac is running in Safe Mode.\nAlternately you can use a utility like Onyx or Cocktail to clear your font caches.\n", "Q: Jailbreak a iPhone 3gs running 4.2.1 preserving BaseBand?

My recollection is that previous behaviour was for the last-used view state to be honoured subsequently, and I would prefer if this applied in Lion also (my personal preference being for Single Page), or if the default could be changed.\nElsewhere, I have seen reference to a Terminal command which was stated as addressing this, but it does not work for me. The command in question is defaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFDisplayMode 1 (with a suggested variation of defaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFDisplayMode -int 1), which is supposed to change the default to Single Page.

Is there any program that allows a user to read eBooks or PDFs in a way that does not bother the eyes, pretty much like what Kindle does? Maybe by reducing the illumination of the monitor and using some other tricks?\n\nA: What you are asking is impossible, I'm afraid. The Kindle uses a different type of technology for its screen called \"e-ink\" or electronic paper:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper\nwhereas laptops (and iPhones, iPads) have backlit LCD screens.\nThe essential difference is that the Kindle screen is lit by the light reflected off it - the same as a printed page - this makes it more relaxing on your eye to read.\nThere is no software way of achieving this on a Mac - you'd need an entirely new screen!\nThere have been rumours that Apple own some e-ink patents but nothing has come of this so far.  \n\nA: If you are experiencing eye fatigue reading the screen on your Mac, you should try the settings available in System Preferences: Universal Access under the \"Seeing\" tab. In the \"Display\" section, you can invert the screen from the usual \"Black on White\" to \"White on black\", giving everything a black background with white text, and inverting all the colors. You can also choose Grayscale, which will eliminate colors altogether, and you can adjust Contrast.\n\nA: The Mac app f.lux will automatically make your screen dimmer and more orange, and thus easier to read at night. This also prevents blue light on the screen, which might help you sleep better. Download F.lux.\n\nA: You may want to try Nocturne (last app on that page). Nocturne is no longer available, see below for a forked version.\nAmong other things, the program lets you remap the black and white points of the colors on the screen.\nWhile the default options are pretty extreme, you could do something like map white to a bright grey, and black to a dark grey, resulting in less contrast. I prefer to use it with black set to a dark grey, and white set to a shade of blue or red… I find it a lot easier on the eyes.\n\nNocturne is no longer available, but there is a fork named Tranquility. Unfortunately, it hasn’t been updated since 2015 (as of February 2017), and there is a comment on this issue suggesting that it was broken by 10.11.6. I have not personally tried this software, so download at your own risk.\n", "Q: How do I use only the external display with my MacBook Pro lid open on Lion? Sorry for the wordy title, but my problem is thus:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I'm at my desk, I would like to use only the external display.\n\n*With the nifty gestures in Lion, I have decided I would like to use the internal trackpad on my MacBook\n\n*To physically touch the trackpad, the lid on my MacBook Pro needs to be open\n\n\nThis used to be a piece of cake with Snow Leopard and below - you plug in the external display, close the lid, plug in a USB device or press a key on a connected keyboard to wake the machine, and once it's woken up and using the external display reopen the lid and the internal screen stays off.\nUnfortunately, Lion detects when my MacBook Pro is open and thinks its being helpful by activating the display. Is there a way to disable that? Is there a way to fool Lion into thinking my lid is closed?\n\nA: I ran into the same problem a while ago, and here's what I did:\nFirst, I mirrored the displays, as has already been suggested. Soon after doing this, I realized that it was very distracting to have the macbook's lit screen off in the corner of my eye. This required that I kill the brightness on the macbook's screen. But being the lazy guy that I am, I hated having to manually adjust the brightness every time I un/plugged an external monitor. So I wondered if there was a way to automate the process.   I found this free app called Control Plane which let's me set \"contexts\" based on whether certain devices (monitors, hard drives, etc) are plugged in, whether certain wi-fi networks are in range, etc; and based on these contexts, run certain shell scripts. So all I had to do was write an applescript (called killBrightness.scpt) to kill the brightness on the macbook's screen and a shell script to call killBrightness.scpt; and call this shell script in the required context.\nkillBrightness.scpt\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to set current pane to pane \"Displays\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"System Preferences\"\n        repeat with theWindow in windows\n            if title of theWindow as string is \"Color LCD\" then\n                tell tab group 1 of theWindow\n                    tell slider 1 of group 2\n                        set value to 0\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n\nThe shell script\n#!/bin/sh\n\nosascript /path/to/killBrightness.scpt\n\nSince I plug many different monitors into my macbook, I noticed that when one with a different aspect ratio is plugged in, my windows hang off the edge of the screen. The solution to this would be to resize the windows, but that's highly inefficient when you use a ton of apps and windows like I do; also, me being as lazy as I am, didn't like that solution. So, with the help of the nice folks over at Stack Overflow, I was able to come up with this AppleScript (called resizer.scpt) to automagically resize all windows of (almost) all apps (the caveat is that some applications don't use the correct UI framework hooks, so it's quite difficult to resize them):\nresizer.scpt:\nproperty blacklist : {\"Finder\", \"Preview\", \"Console\", \"AppleScript Editor\", \"Spotify\", \"TaskCoach\", \"Skype\", \"VirtualBox\"}\nproperty buttonApps : {\"LyX\", \"Eclipse\"}\nproperty buttonMaps : {{name:\"LyX\", Button:1, pname:\"lyx\"}, {name:\"Eclipse\", Button:2, pname:\"eclipse\"}, {name:\"Spotify\", Button:3, pname:\"Spotify\"}, {name:\"TaskCoach\", Button:3, pname:\"TaskCoach\"}}\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to set theBounds to bounds of window of desktop\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set bids to bundle identifier of processes where background only is false\nend tell\n\nrepeat with bid in bids\n    tell application id bid\n        if name is not in blacklist then\n            set appName to name as string\n            if name is \"Terminal\" then\n                set newBounds to {0, 0, (item 3 of theBounds) - 10, item 4 of theBounds}\n                repeat with theWindow in windows\n                    if visible of theWindow is true then\n                        set bounds of theWindow to newBounds\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n            else if name is not in buttonApps then\n                try\n                    repeat with theWindow in windows\n                        if visible of theWindow is true then\n                            set bounds of theWindow to theBounds\n                        end if\n                    end repeat\n                end try\n            else if name is in buttonApps then\n                -- get the buttonNumber\n                repeat with buttonApp in buttonMaps\n                    if (name of buttonApp as string) is appName then\n                        set theButton to Button of buttonApp\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n                tell application \"System Events\"\n                    repeat with theProcess in (processes where bundle identifier is bid)\n                        try\n                            tell theProcess to tell window 1 to click button theButton\n                        end try\n                    end repeat\n                end tell\n            end if\n        end if\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\nNow, all I had to do was write a similar shell script to call resizer.scpt and put that into ControlPlane and I was all set to be lazy all over again!\nHope this helps\nPS: I forgot to mention before that all of this was done on my 15 inch MacBook Pro, running Lion\n\nA: Update 2019\nSince OS X El Capitan, System Integrity Protection (SIP) don't let to change nvram options.

I also moved the menu bar to my desktop monitor and the MacBook screen is completely dimmed.\nThere was another option I heard about: using a magnet to make your MacBook think that the lid was closed. This does work - I placed a snippet of a refrigerator magnet near the bottom left side of my keyboard and sure enough my MacBook thought I had closed the display. Unfortunately, Mac OS X also disables keyboard and trackpad input when it thinks the display is closed, so this option didn't work for me.\n\nA: Quick WorkAround (Not an actual solution)\nJust check the option \"Mirror Displays\" in Display Preferences.

Since I'm not prepared to spend more than it's worth to replace the LCD, I found a solution to use an external screen on native resolution.\nMirror displays is enabled with CMD + F1 to get the external up. Then go to settings - display and turn mirror displays off. The \"Gather Windows\" button will hopefully get the display settings to now show on the external as it did for me.\nNow drag the white menu on the display settings to the external and it will become the primary display.

Ideally I'm looking for an app that would allow me to delete files directly from the iPad (I remember there was one for the Newton that did this quite well, yes I'm old).\n\nA: I use the free iPhone Explorer to mount my iPod touch in the Finder, and I can find individual files and copy them to the Mac or delete them without using iTunes or syncing. It is supposed to work with iPad as well. Give it a try.\n\nA: iOS, which is the operating system that runs on your iPad (iPhones too), is famous for it's somewhat radical approach of not having much of a \"file system\" to speak of. Technically it's still there, but users never see it; so it's safe to just forget that detail. All that data that you're used to seeing in the file system is now literally stored inside each respective app. So if you play a game, all your progress and anything you download for that app is entirely located in that app. If you have a text editor/viewer app, then all your notes and documents are also inside that app. Apps can \"share\" content, but it's really making a copy and if the receiving app happened to keep that content (which they usually will do), it would then be in both apps. If not, it's still in the original app. A common example is when you open a photo editor app and you import a photo from your camera roll/photo album. Same thing.\nWhat this boils down to is that to free up space you have to use the apps themselves to delete the data that's inside them. Alternatively, you can just delete the entire app by holding down on the icon in your home screen for a bit and tapping the little x near it. This will effectively delete all the content, data, preferences etc. along with the app itself all at once. Reinstalling the app from the App Store again is totally free of charge, but it will be back to square 1 as if you were installing it for the 1st time all over again. So don't do this with apps that have content that you don't want to lose.\nThere are some exceptions when it comes to the default apps. They cannot be deleted as a whole, but you can still delete the content inside manually using each respective app.\nTip - videos are what take up the most space of all. So try not to keep a lot of your recorded or downloaded videos on the device. If you happen to jailbreak your device, there is a great iPad/iPhone app called AppInfo that can sort all your installed apps by size and it even accounts for the content currently inside them unlike iTunes which won't account for content inside app.\nPS - as far as the 'without having to sync' part, iOS version 5, which is coming this fall, will add a ton of functionality to the device itself that used to require syncing with iTunes. So the bore of syncing might very well be 100% avoidable at that point.\n\nA: Like any other iOS device you can easily reclaim space by deleting an app manually using the 'x' button after holding down an icon.\n", "Q: How do I make Terminal.app's scrollbars disappear in Lion?

I'd like to install a fresh new copy of Lion OS X. I know how to do that, I can just re-download Lion from the App Store and there are a ton of tutorials online on who to do a fresh install.\nMy question is, how would I back up my documents? Logically, I would like to keep almost all my files and apps. I do have Time Machine. Can someone suggest to me how I should back up and then restore my apps and files and all that? That also includes apps I purchased not through the App Store, like Office and Mailplane. I'd like to continue to use those..\nIf someone knows of a way to optimize my machine without going through all this, could you please suggest to me what to do? It's becoming really slow and I hate it.\nThank you!\n\nA: The best way to back up your documents is to back up your entire hard drive (aka \"clone\").\nI use SuperDuper for this (you can use it for free, although the SmartUpdate feature is worth paying for, IMO. CarbonCopyCloner is another program which many people like).\nOnce you have a bootable backup of your hard drive (verify this by actually booting from it!) you can make a clean installation of your computer. From there you should be able to use \"Migration Assistant\" (/Applications/Utilities) to copy files and applications from either Time Machine or your clone.\nOk, now, having answered the question that you asked, two comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*10gb free isn't a whole lot of space, especially if you are on a non-SSD drive.\n\n*If you are having problems with your current installation, I would highly recommend that you do not use Migration Assistant or any other method to automatically copy files from your current setup to your new one.\nInstead, I would recommend that you keep the clone handy, and if/when you need files from it, then copy them. If you need an app, go make sure that you are downloading the latest version from the website, and install that version.\nMost applications will run from the backup drive (some which use installers might not) so if you need quick access to some program, you can probably just run it from there in an emergency.\nYou can get a 500GB bus-powered USB drive for about $50 from Amazon [note: I just picked that one at random, it's not a specific recommendation] which will fit easily into your laptop bag.\n\nA: The only way to do this if you really want to have a \"clean state\" is by manually copying your documents, music, photos, etc to an external hard drive\nPersonally I wouldn't do this. If you're a programmer you know that you're going to lose a lot of stuff. What I'd suggest you instead is just to try to find the cause of the slowness.\nCheck this:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can upgrade your RAM\n\n*If you have enough hard drive space available (you should leave about 5-10% hard drive sspace empty for swap)\n\n", "Q: Apple App Store continues to show Xcode 4.1 \"Installed\" even though I have uninstalled it. Ok, so Xcode 4.1 was working fine and I did the incremental update to 4.1.1 at the App Store when it came out a few days ago.  Nothing has been stable since that update.\nSo I found on Stackoverflow to use the command:\n      sudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\nin uninstall the environment.\nIt seemed to work as expected. After that, I deleted the remaining empty subfolders in the /Developer folder, emptied the Trash, and rebooted.  \nAt this point I have in every real sense uninstalled and revoved Xcode 4.1.x.

Which I don't.\nWhat to do ? Thank you, I am in a bind here. I need to affect some setting on my Mac that will not indicate a false-positive that I have Xcode installed.  Ideas ?\n-Ric\n\nA: Check your applications folder for the Xcode 4.1 application installer. This is what the Mac App Store actually downloads and is probably reported as installed. Run that again to reinstall. \n\nA: The App Store is pretty aggressive about checking for installed apps. I had similar issues with SuperDuper Clones myself that Mac App Store would find, thus preventing a download/installation/update. See my original question here - Mac App Store updates keep repeating; won't clear\nNow that was a while ago and I had since switched to Carbon Copy Cloner, a comparable alternative to SuperDuper, and haven't had any issues since. To make it sweeter, it's free. I am using it with Lion, no problems. It has in fact been explicitly updated for Lion, so don't let that concern you.\nIt's unfortunate that SuperDuper is still causing these issues. I had assumed Lion or a SuperDuper update would've fixed it by now, but I guess not.\n\nA: Mac App Store tip:\nIf an app isn't installed but Mac OS X thinks it is, open the app's page in the Mac App Store app and then Option + Click the app icon.\nYou should see the price listed, and then a few moments later, the price should change to 'Install'.\naside to @HandyRandy:\nI don't understand why SuperDuper would cause this issue but CCC wouldn't.\n(Also, SuperDuper is free unless you want some specific advanced features.)\nThe problem stems from the fact that the Mac App Store is seeing applications on an external drive. Whether that drive was cloned using CCC or SD should make no difference. \nSince the Mac App Store will only install applications to /Applications/ it seems to me that it should only consider an app \"installed\" if it is present in /Applications/ and its current behavior should be considered a Mac App Store bug, not a reflection on any 3rd party software.\n", "Q: iBook on iPad: turn pages with voice command I bought an iPad for somebody who is paralysed; primarily as a book reader for its ability to enlarge the text- but also to surf the net, etc. with a family member or caregiver using the touchpad.
