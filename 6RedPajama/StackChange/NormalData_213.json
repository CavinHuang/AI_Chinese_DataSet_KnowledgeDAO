["Q: Installing Ubuntu desktop on Ubuntu production web server I have a AWS EC2 Ubuntu Server with LAMP stack (Apache2, MySQL-Client (Database is on different DB server), PHP) which will be used as production web server. Till now I had been using the terminal over ssh via putty to do all the installation and configuration.\nI am just thinking to install ubuntu-desktop and vnc-server to access desktop via vnc.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does installing ubuntu-desktop convert my server to a desktop instance of ubuntu? I definitely do not want to do that.\n\n*Will installing these additional software overload the servers performance? I know there will be some resource requirement to run these software as well but it cannot be substantial.\n\n*The advantage of having a desktop I think is, It is easier to install and maintain the web server and its components.\n\n*Right now I access my server using a ssh private key over putty, can I access VNC similarly, if yes how?\n\n\nThanks\nKarmendra\n\nA: You can install it using sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.\nAlthough I don't think it will be very useful as you will still need to do most of the configuration through terminal and text-based files.\nGood riddance.\n", "Q: Windows can't see a partition after i installed ubuntu this is my first time installing linux, i'm completely new here.\nI installed ubuntu on top of Windows 10.

The problem is that I sometimes forget to sync a device on which I've modified a file and this makes things complicated. My first question is how to make syncing automatic in Ubuntu, I mean syncing when a file is modified but not \"too often\" (like when I'm working on a text file.)\nNow a problem with automatic syncing is that if I screw up a file on one device it can propagate to others (and I may not even realize it when I delete a file by mistake). So I'd like to have backups on the remote server. Sometime ago I used the backup option in rsync but then the backed up files were synced back and forth and it created a mess. How can I have backups of the old files on the remote server without them being sent back to local devices? Is there any way to control how many back ups of each file are kept?\n\nA: You can have several backups when you use the rsync option --link-dest.\nrsync will create another directory with your backup tree, hardlink the files that didn't change, and only copy the changed files. That way you don't use twice the space. For excample:\nrsync -a --delete --link-dest=../previous_backup source_directory/  backup\n\nYou have to use a filesystem that supports hard links for this to work, ext4 works fine.\nI have used an NTFS removable disk in the past, but the filesystem had a big performance hit: a 130 GB backup with around 15 previous backups would take more than 80 minutes to complete. After I have moved the entire tree to an ext4 partition (on the same disk), the subsequent backups would take around 2 minutes to complete.\nI have adapted the scripts from this page for my needs:\nhttp://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/\n\nA: I would advise to split backup and sync. Use for example rsnapshot for your backups and lsync, owncloud, git or rsync (depending on needs and situation) for syncing the data to work on them. \n", "Q: Bash regular expression I need to write a regular expression in bash to find the words with 5 characters where the last character is 'c' and the words contain a '.'

I have succesfully created a bootable version on USB (Ubuntu 14.04.3) and even managed to install packages etc.  I have even been able to apply updates (some errors are displayed about filesystems).\nThe problem arises when I try to reboot from this USB version.  It gets into a screen with \"initramfs\" prompt, which is essentially a dead end.  Even more bothersome is that Windows 7 (on the hard disk) displays boot problems (scary blue screen), but does come back in the 2nd or 3rd attempt...phew! \nI am looking for a sure shot remedy - not a trial and error process.  I cannot afford to have the laptop messed up.  Also, it has an encrypted hard drive so I cannot make it into a dual boot.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Universal USB Installer is by far the best, in my opinion, automated method to create a live-disk version of Ubuntu on a bootable USB Drive. It has the ability to Set a Persistent Size, which is what you want. This creates space to saves changes on the flash drive and allows you to modify Ubuntu on the USB and reboot. The changes will \"persist\", but you need to realize that there is a 4 GB limit with the utility, and to create a larger one, you will need to specially format a partition on the usb drive. There are tutorials online for this as well.\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nThe second post at How do I get a live-USB to use a partition for persistence? describes this in more detail.\nAlso, this is a duplicate of like 40 questions on askubuntu alone.\nYou will run into the problem that the apt-get cache will fill up quickly, so you'll want to do something like run the janitor in Ubuntu-Tweak or you'll run out of space. Also, the high number of reads/writes will eventually destroy your flash drive. If it is important that you have a persistent flash drive, it might be worth your time to back it up to a second flash drive, or ensure that you store important data on the cloud, in case the flash drive fails.\n", "Q: Wifi USB stick working but not displayed I plugged a WiFi USB stick and I got instantaly access to Internet.

If some kind of extra information is needed please say so.\nThank you, best regards.\n\nA: \nFew days ago I tried to install Windows 10 using USB stick, but couldn't because Ubuntu didn't boot it.\n\nSo, that's a misconception here. Ubuntu won't boot from your USB stick. That has to happen before you boot Ubuntu or any other operating system.\nFirst off, not all computers can boot from USB, they need to be sufficiently new to support this (the last couple of years should be fine).\nPlug-in your USB stick and reboot your PC. What happens next depends on your PC (and the BIOS/UEFI).\nUsually you will see a message like \"Press some key to change boot device\". So, often you'll see a message and it'll tell you what key to press to select a boot device. Sometimes you will only see a message about \"BIOS setup\" or similar and you will have to change the boot priority there.\nWhat do I mean by boot priority? That's the priority of devices your BIOS/UEFI will check for operating systems (or boot loaders). On modern systems, the hard disk will often be the first. Since that's where your groub boot loader is, it won't continue searching.\nIf you tell us your PC model/manufacturer, we/I/you could search for the exact message.\nEDIT:\nI found a list of keys for different vendors/models.

So now if i remove linux partition will grub be still available? \nDisclaimer: I don't intend to uninstall Linux i'm just curious\n\nA: First, there are two distinct issues involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS vs. EFI -- This is the type of firmware on the computer; or in some cases, because EFIs include a BIOS emulation layer, EFI-based computers can boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. The version of GRUB 2 installed on the computer depends on the firmware type. Under BIOS, a 16-bit GRUB 2 (from the grub-pc package, IIRC) is installed; and under EFI, a GRUB 2 compiled to the same bit depth as the EFI itself (32- or 64-bit) is installed from the grub-efi-ia32 or grub-efi-amd64 package.\n\n*MBR vs. GPT -- The partition table type affects the details of where parts of BIOS-mode GRUB is installed -- on an MBR disk, the second stage of the boot loader goes in officially-unallocated sectors immediately following the MBR itself; and on a GPT disk, those second-stage files go in a special partition called the BIOS Boot Partition (identified as being type EF02 in gdisk or as having the \"bios_grub flag\" set in parted or GParted). For an EFI-mode boot, the partition table type is less important; it's just that the EFI System Partition (ESP) has a type code of EF under MBR using fdisk, whereas under GPT, it's identified with a type code of EF00 in gdisk or by a \"boot flag\" in parted or GParted. (Note that the \"boot flag\" has an entirely different meaning on MBR disks; an ESP cannot be properly identified on an MBR disk using parted or GParted.)\n\n\nIn all cases, GRUB 2's code is scattered all over the place. Locations where it might exist include:\n\n\n*\n\n*The MBR -- In this context, \"MBR\" means the first sector of the disk. This location is used by most BIOS-mode installations, for both MBR and GPT disks. The first-stage GRUB code goes here, but the space is limited (just 440 bytes), so it's impossible to fit all of GRUB in the MBR.\n\n*Boot sectors on a Linux filesystem partition -- It's possible to install BIOS-mode GRUB so that its first-stage code goes in a partition rather than in an MBR. This configuration is unusual in Ubuntu.\n\n*Post-MBR sectors -- As noted earlier, on an MBR disk, GRUB stores part of itself immediately after the MBR.\n\n*The BIOS Boot Partition -- As noted earlier, a separate partition exists to take the place of the post-MBR sectors on a GPT disk. (This is done because the post-MBR sectors under GPT are part of the GPT itself, so they can't be used by GRUB.)\n\n*The ESP -- Under EFI, the main GRUB 2 binary goes in a file on the ESP. This file contains the equivalent of a BIOS-mode GRUB 2's MBR and post-MBR/BIOS Boot Partition code. The ESP is not used by GRUB for a BIOS-mode boot.\n\n*The Linux /boot directory -- In all cases, parts of GRUB 2 reside in files it can load from a normal filesystem. These files are normally in the Linux /boot directory, typically in /boot/grub or /boot/grub2.\n\n\nThis last point, really, is the \"gotcha;\" if you delete Ubuntu from a dual-boot installation, GRUB 2 will be partially removed, and so it will almost certainly launch but not work correctly because you will have deleted these configuration and support files. You'll end up with a grub> prompt when you try to boot. Under BIOS, your only choice at this point is to re-install the boot loader for your other OS. Under EFI, you can usually get the system booting again by adjusting the boot order using any number of tools (efibootmgr in Linux, bcdedit or EasyUEFI in Windows, bless in OS X, bcfg in an EFI shell, or system-specific firmware tools in many EFIs). Re-installing another OS's boot loader should also work, but is normally overkill.\nNote that most boot loaders lack this particular problem. Under EFI, ELILO, GRUB Legacy, SYSLINUX, gummiboot/systemd-boot, and rEFInd all rely on configuration files stored on the same partition as the boot loader (normally the ESP), so if you delete Ubuntu, the worst that will happen is that you'll end up being unable to boot Ubuntu but you'll still be able to boot anything else you have installed. Under BIOS, LILO should still continue to work; but if I'm not mistaken, GRUB Legacy and SYSLINUX both share GRUB 2's problem.\nIt's possible to configure GRUB 2 to place its configuration and support files on the ESP rather than on a Linux filesystem. For reasons I don't claim to know, however, Ubuntu's developers chose to put the files on a Linux filesystem, so Ubuntu suffers from this problem.\n", "Q: HDMI display just stopped working I am using Ubuntu (Kodibuntu actually, which is a flavor of Trusty) and I connected my display via HDMI.

How can I do something similar automatically?\n\nA: This can be a hardware problem, so if you have a dedicated graphics card with the driver installed, make sure the display is connected to it.\nAlso make sure that there isn't an issue with the Display (try connect it to another computer and see the results or try another HDMI cable).\n", "Q: How to get rid of the DNS Unlocker adware? From this morning I'm witnessing unfamiliar ads apearing in different pages while using Firefox which they say \"Ads by DNSUnlocker\".\n\nI searched for it and it seems this is a known adware infecting Windows PCs and there are several steps to get rid of it (source-1, source-2).\nSince I'm on Ubuntu I believe I must've been infected by browsing to a malicious URL, or installing an untrusted Firefox add-on, or maybe this adware also has a Linux version!\nAnyway, how can I get rid of it? I checked my Firefox add-ons and there was nothing unfamiliar. One of the steps in the Windows solution is to RESET Firefox and Chrome settings!\nI really don't want to reset my settings since I need them and redoing all the preferences is not easy. I need some help to disinfect my system and preferably, find the root cause of it.\n\nUPDATE:\nI closed Firefox, and opened Chromium and the ads didn't show up in the same websites I visited in Firefox. Then I opened Firefox again and unfortunately the ads were back again. So it seems the problem is specific to Firefox.\nAlso it might be worth mentioning that in both Firefox and Chromium I've had the 'Adblock Plus' add-on activated for years and it works great, but since yesterday I'm witnessing these strange ads poping up in some webpages.\n\nUPDATE-2:\nI opened Firefox in safe-mode (all add-ons and custom settings disabled) to see if the ads will go away, but unfortunately the ads also apear in safe mode! I guess this means that even reseting Firefox won't fix the problem! \nWhat other explanation could this have? Before this safe-mode test, I was almost certain that the problem was with Firefox being infected, but after this I don't know what's going on! Could my system be infected with a Linux-compatible malware?!\nNow I'm really pissed-off! Any help?\n\nA: So I figured out how to get rid of this pest. I thought using Firefox's \"Safe Mode\" was a true indicator if the infection was related to Firefox or not. But it turned out to be false!\nThe solution for this was to clear the .mozilla folder in the home directory (which is hidden), and it will make Firefox have a fresh start. Of course, this way you will lose all the bookmarks, saved passwords, sessions, add-ons, etc. But at least it gives you a clean browser back again.\nSome of these can somehow be saved to restore again, like bookmarks can be saved by exporting them to JSON. Others (such as the add-ons) I don't recommend to backup and I recommend to reinstall them after reseting Firefox.\n", "Q: Interesting VirtualBox Plex Permissions Issue My system is setup with an Ubuntu 14.04 installation running a 14.04 guest virtual machine, via Oracle's Virtual Box.\nI also have 3 x 2TB drives setup in a zpool.

Sickrage monitors torrentsdownloaded and post processes into /media/sf_dataset2/Television.\nOutside of the virtual machine, in the \"base\" Ubuntu install, I have a plex server running, and it monitors /mnt/dataset2/[Media Folders].\nI just switched to this setup, and noticed that Plex wasn't finding new media, despite it being in the proper place. That led me to check the permissions. After being downloaded, the files have permissions of:\nOwner - Read/Write\nGroup - Read/Write\nOthers - Read Only\n\nAnd, because this is inside of the virtual machine, the owner is root and the group is vboxsf.\nAfter Sickrage post processes, the permissions change to \nOwner - Read/Write\nGroup - Read/Write\nOthers - None\n\nI think this is because Sickrage gives permissions to files based upon the permissions of the directory in which the file is placed. And because these are shared folders, they all have permissions of 770, and I can't change them to 777 (I tried).\nOutside of the virtual machine, the permissions on the downloaded files and post-processed files are the same. The owner and group are [user]:[usergroup]. So Plex doesn't have any permissions, and it isn't seeing the files.\nOne fix for this is to chmod 777 the transferred files. But I don't want to do it manually (the whole system is supposed to be automated). But my idea for an automated solution was a crontab in conjunction with a script to \nchmod 777 -R /mnt/dataset2 \n\nevery minute. I'm worried that that might damage my drives from too many writes and reads.\nAnother solution is that I could change the owner of all of the files to [user]:plex. If I do that, I think future post processed files would then be 770, with an owner of user and group of plex. Because user plex, which runs the plex server, is a member of the plex group, that would take care of the permissions issues. The only problem here is that I think I'd have to change deluge to run as user plex. Otherwise, my files would be downloaded with [user]:[usergroup] ownership.\nStill, I wanted to bounce this off of the community and see what they say. Would my chmod 777 every minute cause undue stress on my system or drives?\nIs there a downside to making plex the owner of all of my files like that? Am I going to have to reconfigure deluge?\nMaybe a third option would be to make user plex a member of [usergroup]. But that would give plex access to a lot of files, and doesn't sound ideal.\nEDIT:\nI've been able to remove some speculation. The fact that this is going on in a VM doesn't seem to matter. I have CouchPotato similarly renaming and moving movie files. After being processed by CouchPotato, the files show up with workable permissions. \nThis means there must be something strange in SickBeard. I've posted in a Sickbeard-specific forum.\n\nA: If Deluge is creating the files then that is where you need to change the permissions. One solution is to use ACLs, another is to change the umask for the deluge service and add users to the service group.\n\nA: Hi I think the answer is in understanding which systems are writing to your data from where and how they access it.  I.e. connecting through smb or afp creates different scenarios and connecting through NFS is different again.  If you're using afp, I'd recommend switching to smb and if you're connecting through NFS you need to match the uid and gid correctly. \nFurther if I'm reading correctly you also have a virtual machine connecting through some native VM sharing.  Unless that has options for default user, group and mode I'd avoid it and just set it up with OS networking, using e.g. NFS above.  This way you can get control over just who your media system thinks is writing your data and what default permissions it requires, maintaining consistency over it.  I've just written a guide over on Tech-KnowHow that covers most of this yesterday which may help.  Let me know if it doesn't work as it's still relatively fresh in my mind and I may be able to add something further.  Good luck.\nDirect link: https://www.tech-knowhow.com/2016/03/how-to-plex-permissions-linux/\n**Update 27 April 2016 **\nI came back to see how you were getting on, it doesn't look like you've resolved this yet?  I see your update about Sickbeard and I'm still convinced this is permissions related at the OS level, rather than application specific.  Did you get any luck with Sickbeard yet?  Linux permissions are a real pain.\nThere is of course ACL's too, which are somewhat easier to understand, but it does work with standard Linux permissions too once you get your head around them.\nMarshalleq\n", "Q: Upgrading to newest nVidia drivers on a laptop that uses Optimus?

I've got an HP Pavilion Touchsmart notebook that came with Windows 8. I've upgraded to 8.1, and now I want to dual-boot an Ubuntu distribution with Windows 10. When dual-booting with Windows 8.1, the Windows Boot Manager always took priority, even after installing GRUB. What do I need to do to get GRUB to be the default bootloader instead of Windows Boot Manager?\n\nA: I have a Samsung laptop with Windows 10 already installed and I was trying to install Linux with multiple instances; Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, and 16.04. I used Boot-Repair and changed Boot Priority in my BIOS setup which resulted in a functional, but messy GRUB loading first. Answer by user Michael Hoffmann provides good explanation for install on blank drive and how to clean up GRUB, but I didn't want to remove my Windows 10 install.\nDetailed explanation can be found in my post\n\nA: I can present to you a simple hack for this problem, use it if none of  the legit solutions solved your problem.\nAs Windows keeps changing the boot order, the hack is to trick Windows to recognize Ubuntu grub as Windows boot file i.e. bootmgfw.efi\n\nPart 1: Accessing EFI folder on Windows\n\nOpen cmd as administrator and mount the EFI folder to access it. Execute  the following commands one by one. Below I have assigned letter g to the mount, make sure you assign a unassigned letter in your PC. \nmountvol g: /s\ng:\ncd EFI\\\n\nYou should see a Microsoft folder and Ubuntu folder within EFI.\n\nPart 2: Copy grubx64.efi from Ubuntu to Microsoft\\Boot\\ as bootmgfw.efi\n\nFirst create a backup of bootmgfw.efi\ncd Microsoft\\Boot\\\nrename bootmgfw.efi bootmgfw_.efi\n\nNow do the copy and rename.\ncopy g:\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi g:\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\\nrename grubx64.efi bootmgfw.efi\n\n\nPart 3: Unmount the EFI folder\n\nExecute the following commands one by one.\nc:\nmountvol g: /d\n\nNow reboot your PC and you should see Ubuntu GRUB load up which should have an option Windows UEFI loader to boot Windows as well.\n\nA: This is the longest post I've ever made on a StackExchange site, but this process requires a lot of explanation and attention to detail. It's also somewhat specific to the hardware in question, which requires more explanation. \nAfter a lot of headache, two accidental hard drive reformattings, and lots of frustration with HP's buggy firmware implementation, I finally got Xubuntu and Windows 10 running nicely side-by-side. I've done this with Windows 10, but it should also work with Windows 8.1. Both of these newer operating systems use the new(ish) UEFI firmware system, instead of the traditional BIOS system, which is where most confusions with dual-booting seem to arise. I read lots of things from lots of places with instructions for dual-booting with a BIOS system, that talk about UEFI as if it's just a different kind of BIOS, or an optional layer between BIOS and an OS. UEFI and BIOS are not the same thing; a UEFI is not a BIOS, and a BIOS is not a UEFI. They're completely different. There are some things that need to be done differently when dual-booting with a UEFI system.\nFirstly, do not use EasyBCD. I've seen a lot of outdated dual-booting tutorials that recommend EasyBCD, but it is designed to work with traditional BIOS firmware used by Windows 7 and Windows Vista, and it does not work well with newer UEFI firmware (Windows 8, 8.1, or 10). If you have already fiddled with EasyBCD, don't worry- the worst it probably did is make a mess in your EFI boot entries by writing things to the MBR. We'll clean that up in step 4. Speaking of MBR, avoid that like the plague. The Master Boot Record is what's used in traditional BIOS firmware as a list of bootloaders stored in the boot partition (or, if written by Windows, in whichever partition is first) of your hard drive. It's meant to list the operating systems on the hard drive, and tell the firmware which one gets booted first. This does not work well with HP's UEFI firmware. It seems that if there's any MBR modification done, HP's UEFI firmware gets confused and runs back to the Windows Boot Manager, which will completely bypass GRUB.\nWhat you'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*A live USB or installation CD with your preferred Ubuntu distribution.\n\n*Installation media for your Windows OS. If you're upgrading from Windows 8.1, you can do it without downloading the full 3+ GB .iso for Windows 10- there is a web installer that downloads it as it installs- but, for this method, you need the .iso extracted to a CD or USB drive. It's also a good idea to have it on hand for the future, so you might as well create it now. Since this question is about dual-booting with a UEFI system, you'll need the 64-bit OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have your Product Key, or you won't be able to upgrade/install.\n\n\n*Optional, but highly recommended: A drive large enough to back up your current Windows files.\n\n*Enough space on your hard drive for both operating systems, a boot partition (only 200 MB), and a linux-swap partition (usually the same size as your physical RAM).\n\n\nStep 1: Make a backup\nBack up all of your Windows files and folders that you don't want to lose. As long as you have enough free hard drive space for your new Ubuntu partition, this process should not interfere with Windows files. Should is a risky word, though.\nWindows 8.1 has a \"make a recovery disk\" tool, but I found it useless and non-functional when it came to restoring the backup I made with it. The most straightforward way to preserve the files you don't want to lose is to just open Windows Explorer, and copy them to a backup disk. It takes forever, but it's worth it.\nStep 2: Disable Fast Startup, and shut down your computer\nYou'll need to be logged in as an administrator to do this.\nIt's very important to disable Fast Startup before installing GRUB, because whether the Ubuntu installer can detect Windows' presence depends on how Windows represents itself in the boot partition. With Fast Startup properly disabled, it should be detected. Detection will be covered in step 4.\nWindows 8, 8.1, and 10 use this fancy new thing called Fast Startup, which tells your firmware to load a special bootloader that restores the system to its pre-shutdown state very quickly. Pretty cool, huh? Well, because it changes the EFI system's next-boot option, this feature will have to be disabled while you're installing GRUB. This can be done by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Control Panel (Windows+X->Control Panel from the desktop in Windows 8+) (apparently Microsoft hates power users, so searching the Start Menu for \"Control Panel\" is now the fastest way to open it)\n\n*Navigate to Power Options\n\n*Click \"Choose what the power button does\"\n\n*Click \"Change settings that are currently unavailable\"\n\n*Make sure the box that says \"Turn on fast startup (Recommended)\" at the bottom is not checked.\n\n\nMore detailed instructions can be found here. You can re-enable Fast Startup after installing GRUB, and it seems not to cause any problems with Ubuntu/GRUB booting. Just make sure it's disabled during the installation.\nAfter you've disabled Fast Startup, shut down your computer. Since Fast Startup is disabled, Windows will do a complete shutdown, and not change the next-boot option in the firmware's EFI manager. (Layman's terms: Windows won't tell your HP system to boot its Fast Startup file when it's next turned on, so it will use the EFI boot manager's list, as it should. GRUB will place itself first on this list.)\nStep 3: Set up the partitions with gparted\nBefore installing Ubuntu, you'll want to use your live CD/USB to make a separate partition for it. That way, it *won't overwrite Windows.\n*Make sure you've got a backup. No guarantees- this depends on what Windows has decided to do in your boot partition, and it may also depend on which Ubuntu version/distribution you're using- I haven't used them all.\nTo make the partitions, you need to boot to your live CD/USB, and open gparted. There are plenty of tutorials on using gparted, and it's pretty easy to figure out, so I'll leave the specifics up to you and the Internet.\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need 4 partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*A boot partition. If you already have Windows installed, you shouldn't need to do anything- it should already be one of the first partitions in your drive. Sometimes Windows also makes another small partition at the beginning of the disk called Recovery. Just leave this alone.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're doing a new installation, and you want to start everything from scratch (this will wipe out all of your data), go ahead and delete all of the partitions on your drive, and then make this partition. It should be the first partition; its format should be FAT32; and it should be at least 200 MB in size. If gparted has an option to label it, just call it boot. If there's not label option, don't worry about it. You must, however, set the \"boot\" and \"esp\" flags on this partition ; without them, the Ubuntu installer will just ignore it and use a legacy mode install, and Windows (10) will refuse to install altogether with the error \"we couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one\". Or not. It seems to depend on how Windows feels that day...\n\n\n*A Windows partition. Again, if you already have Windows installed, this partition should obviously be here, after the boot and Recovery partitions. This is where you want it, but you need to resize it to make room for your Ubuntu partition, and the linux-swap partition. Use gparted's resize/move option to do this. Ubuntu needs at least 5 GB, and the linux-swap partition should be at least half the size of your physical RAM, so Resize the windows partition to make enough room for that. gparted will warn you about potential data loss- shrinking your partition should not destroy or corrupt any data, as long as you don't shrink it down into the space being used.\n\n\n*\n\n*If installing both operating systems from scratch (again, this will wipe out all of your data), Microsoft says you'll need at least 20 GB for the 64-bit OS, so this partition needs to be at least 20 GB. You'll probably want more than that, though: I just used half of the space after the boot partition for Windows, and half of it for Ubuntu and linux-swap. If you're going from scratch, this partition needs to be formatted as FAT32. When you install Windows, it will format it to NTFS. Do not do this with gparted; Windows' implementation of NTFS is different than gparted's implementation, and Windows may not be able to recognize the partition. In the Windows 10 installer, you should have the option to select which partition to place Windows 10 on. If it's formatted as FAT32, Windows should be able to see it and install itself there. If you can label this partition, label it Windows. That will make it easier for you during the Windows install. Speaking of the Windows installer- don't begin that yet. If you're doing new installations of both Ubuntu and Windows at the same time, instead of upgrading from 8 or 8.1 to 10, it's much easier to install Ubuntu first.\n\n\n*A Linux partition. Like the Windows partition, this can vary in size, but Ubuntu's website recommends at least 5 GB. Again, you'll probably want a lot more than that. If you're upgrading instead of doing a fresh install of both operating systems, you should be able to create this partition in the new \"unallocated\" space shown in gparted. Make it as big as you like but remember to leave space for a linux-swap partition if you plan on using one. It should be formatted as ext4. ext2 or ext3 should work too, if you prefer those for some reason.\n\n\n*\n\n*If installing from scratch, make your Ubuntu partition just as described above. Make sure it's formatted as ext4, ext3, or ext2. This will allow Ubuntu to use it, but keep the Windows 10 installer from recognizing it, which should cause it to default to the FAT32 partition you made in step 3, which it can read.\n\n\n*Optional, but recommended: a linux-swap partition. At least half the size of your physical RAM is a good start, but I recommend reading the details. I've got 8 GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive, so I just made this partition the same size as my physical RAM.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Install Ubuntu first\nWhether you're upgrading to Windows 10 from an existing Windows OS, or installing both Windows 10 and an Ubuntu distribution to a new or newly-repartitioned hard drive, it's a lot easier to install Ubuntu first. Ubuntu uses GRUB 2 as its bootloader, which does things the way an EFI bootloader should. Windows 10 uses Windows Boot Manager, which does things... well, the way Windows does them... If you install Windows first, you likely won't be able to boot to Ubuntu without holding down a special key during the boot process to stop the Windows Boot Manager from loading, because Windows Boot Manager doesn't respect GRUB when it's added to its list of bootloaders. So instead, install Ubuntu and GRUB first, then add an entry to GRUB for the Windows Boot Manager.\nStep 4.1: Cleaning out old EFI entries (optional)\nPlease be careful here. Deleting the wrong thing can cause huge problems.\nBefore installing Ubuntu, we want to make sure that the ghosts of past OS installations aren't going to come back to haunt us in the future. In a UEFI system, operating systems use EFI (extensible firmware interface) files to tell the firmware: \"Hey, I exist. This is where you can find me.\" When a new OS is installed, it adds an entry to the EFI Boot Manager's list, which gives it a unique entry number, and tells the EFI Boot Manager where it's EFI file(s) is/are (Windows registers several different EFI files- one for regular boot, one for a recovery boot, one for Fast Startup- possibly more depending on your firmware and your OS version). The EFI Boot Manager also keeps track of the boot-order: a list of entry numbers that specify what gets booted first. If you've been using EasyBCD; bcdedit; Windows' Boot Repair or Recovery tools; boot-repair in a Linux OS; or even if you've updated Windows or reinstalled it, there's a good chance that your EFI entry list now has some duplicates. At least, that was the case with mine. Having duplicates here can bog down your booting process, as the firmware sifts through the out-of-date or wrong-file entries until it finds a bootloader that works. It can also cause a boot-loop, where bootloader A points the firmware to bootloader B, which points it back to A, and then things start to take a very, very long time...\nAnyway, to view your EFI entry list and see what needs to be cleaned, use the efibootmgr package with your live CD/USB. You'll need to install it using sudo apt-get install efibootmgr in a terminal, then run it using sudo efibootmgr. By default, you'll get a list of entries that looks something like this:\n\nWhen I first used this tool after fiddling with EasyBCD and bcdedit trying to get things to boot in the right order, I had over a hundred entries here, most of them duplicates.\nIf your boot manager list isn't too cluttered, or if you're not comfortable deciding what can be deleted and what shouldn't be deleted, just skip to step 4.2.\nTo clean out any entries you don't need, use efibootmgr -b <hex_number> -B, where hex_number is replaced by the number listed with the boot entry. So, to remove the USB Drive (UEFI) entry (numbered Boot2001) in the picture above, I'd use sudo efibootmgr -b 2001 -B. You'll notice that I left some duplicates (all of the 3000+ numbered entries). You can use efibootmgr with different options to view some other attributes of the entries, such as the file paths they point to. Those entries look like duplicates, but they all point to different files used by my HP laptop to update its BIOS. Please be careful what you remove. It can be very difficult or impossible to replace things here. You can also use efibootmgr to change the BootOrder, which it displays. See the man page for more information on this useful tool.\nStep 4.2: Installing Ubuntu\nAfter you've cleaned up the EFI Boot Manager entries, if you chose to do so, it's finally time to install Ubuntu. With your live CD/USB loaded, select the install option from the bootloader menu, or launch it from the desktop after logging in. Choose your options on the first page of the installer. The second part will look something like this: (I'm using Xubuntu 14.04, so your installer may vary, but the options should be pretty similar.)\n\nIf your installer doesn't detect your Windows installation (like mine), you'll need to select the \"Something else\" option. From there, you'll get a screen that looks similar to the gparted menu you used to set up your partitions. Simply select the partitions you made, and assign them to the correct mount point by selecting a partition and clicking \"Change\".\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're installing both OSes from scratch, do the same thing. Do not use the automatic installation option. You need to make sure Ubuntu gets installed in the ext2/ext3/ext4 partition, not the FAT32 Windows partition.\n\n\nStep 5: Update or install Windows second\nYou should have an installation disk for Windows 10. Before you start installing, make sure you have your product key nearby, or you won't be able to install/upgrade. When you boot to the installation CD/USB, the installer is pretty simple. A bit too simple for my comfort- the only button was \"Install Windows 10\" or something like that, and Windows 8, 8.1, and 10, are infamous for their behind-the-scenes installs, where it simply says \"We're getting things ready\", and provides no details about what it's actually doing to your system. If you've followed these instructions so far, it should be OK to begin installation regularly.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're upgrading from Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, you shouldn't have to do anything special with the installation process. Get through the (very long) installation, and proceed to step 6.\n\n*If you're doing a fresh install, the installer will ask you where you want to install Windows 10. Make sure you select the FAT32 partition you made in step 2, and not another partition, or that partition will be wiped and formatted. Because Ubuntu is already installed, Windows 10 should be respectful of the boot partition and not reformat it. Having the rubbish entries cleaned out of the EFI Boot Manager's list will also free up space in the tiny 200 MB boot partition, lessening the chances that Windows will get confused and angry and clear the whole thing for itself.\nStep 6: Update and (optionally) customize GRUB\nAfter installing or upgrading to Windows 10, you'll need to reboot to Ubuntu to update GRUB so it includes Windows Boot Manager on its list. Before you do this, disable Fast Startup again. This is done very similarly to how you did it in step 2. The control panel and settings UI are a bit different, but most of the options are still there.\nAfter you've disabled Fast Startup again, reboot your computer.\nIf Windows boots by default, you will need to hold down the special key for your laptop to get to the system's firmware menu. On my HP Touchsmart, that key is Esc. Other common keys are F12, Delete, F10... Your computer's manual should be able to help you out here. From the firmware menu, boot into GRUB. There should be an option to \"select a boot device\" or something similar, and Ubuntu or GRUB should be listed there. If it's not listed, look for an option to boot from an EFI file, and browse to /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi or (if you have Secure Boot enabled), EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi instead. The actual paths of these files may vary depending on your options, and how your boot partition is set up, but the file names should be the same. Selecting one of these .efi files should boot to GRUB, where you can then boot to your Ubuntu distribution. Once you've logged in, open a terminal and type sudo update-grub. This will run the os-prober script that GRUB uses to compile grub.cfg, which tells grub's EFI file which entries to include, what colors to use, etc. The os-prober script should identify Windows Boot Manager, and automatically add it to the list.\nOptionally, you can install Grub Customizer to change the order of menu entries and change the behavior and the color and background of the GRUB menu. You can install this from a terminal using sudo apt-get install grub-customizer, and then run sudo grub-customizer.\nWhen using GRUB on a UEFI system shared with a Windows OS, DO NOT install to MBR. Some tutorials list it as a crucial step to use Grub Customizer's \"Install to MBR\" option under the File menu. You should not do this on most UEFI systems. The MBR (Master Boot Record) is designed for BIOS firmwares, and is still used by the Windows Boot Loader to some extent. Adding GRUB to the MBR, when it's already in the EFI entry list, can cause lots of hairballs.\nIf you need to make sure that GRUB is the first entry in the boot-order list (i.e. if Windows is always booting, even though you did everything right), use efibootmgr (see step 4.1) to view/edit the EFI Manager's boot order.\nNotes\nI haven't mentioned Secure Boot at all, because it should normally not affect Ubuntu's installation. Many dual-booting tutorials talk about disabling it, but that's usually not necessary with a current 64-bit installer. However, each PC is different, and Secure Boot is fairly new (2012), so different firmwares may implement things differently. For example, the version of my HP firmware includes a \"legacy boot\" option, which disables Secure Boot and treats installed OSes as though it were BIOS firmware: some people recommend enabling this for installing for dual-boot. Installing Ubuntu in legacy boot mode on my system prevented GRUB from adding itself to the EFI entry list, so all it could do was add itself to the MBR, which Windows Boot Manager had full control of. Windows Boot Manager took a lot of tweaking to even display the list of entries, and after all that, it would only boot the Windows entries, making GRUB unusable without manually selecting its EFI file every time I powered on.\nSee here for more information on Ubuntu and Secure Boot and Legacy Boot, and information about the difference between UEFI and BIOS installations in general.\n\nA: A bit easier solution for the above problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press F10 during boot-up to go through Advanced BIOS settings\n\n*In BIOS Boot Order settings enable Legacy Boot order which will enable both UEFI and Legacy Boot Order. \n\n*Increasing Boot Delay to 5 secs will give some time during boot time OS selection.  \n\n*Save the BIOS settings and exit.\n\n*On the next boot you will be asked about boot selection option. Press F9 to enter and select the appropriate boot option (Windows OS Boot Manager or Ubuntu)\n\n\nA: I found a much simpler solution, which worked on an HP laptop (355 G2) which had windows 10 installed\n\n\n*\n\n*Press escape while booting\n\n*Press F9 for boot options\n\n*Select the USB option that is not UEFI (on mine it was the bottom in the list) and hit Enter\n\n*You will then get an error message screen. However, you just have to type 'live' to try out the OS or 'live-install' and hit enter to install it, and all should go swimmingly....\n\n", "Q: What version of Ubuntu for a Compaq Armada E500?

You are connected on roter and have ip: 10.42.0.1 with nm: 255.255.255.0 but in routing table you do not have default gateway. If you known ip address of you router add default gateway with this command\n sudo ip route add default gateway via ip_address_of_router\n\nor if you don't known ip of router try with this command\n sudo ip route add default dev wlan0\n\nEdit 1\nThat is the problem. Your interface have address 10.42.0.1 with mask 255.255.255.0. That mean that you can communicate with host from range 10.42.0.2 till 10.42.0.254. You can not try to set gateway 67.189.92.17.\nGateway is, usually, ip address from lan side of your router.\nIp address 67.189.92.17 is public ip address and probably you router have this address on wan interface.\nI don't known right address of you router but I guess is 10.42.0.254.\nAlso you can run command arp to see all hoston your local lan.\nIf you do not have success in setting a gw post output form arp command.  \n\nA: Please note:\n\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:\"3535\"\nMode:Ad-Hoc  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Cell: 4E:16:E0:97:CB:B8\n            Tx-Power=20 dBm\n            Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n            Power Management:off\n\nAd-Hoc mode is used for computer-to-computer connections, not computer-to-router connections (usually known as infrastructure).

In Ubuntu when I run lspci -nn both the cards have the same device id.\nExample Output:\n01:00.0 Example GPU 1 [8080:aa68]\n04:00.0 Example GPU 2 [8080:aa68]\n\nNotice the device ids \"8080:aa68\" are the same. So my question is why are the ids the same? I'm trying to pass through one of the cards to kvm but both get passed because the ids are the same. So what could I do to solve this?\nUpdate 1: I've tried setpci -s 04:00.0 02.w=aa69 it doesn't do anything the device id stays the same. I also tried echo \"8086 10f5\" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/radeon/new_id but it says the file exists.\nUpdate 2: If I do this echo 0000:04:00.0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:04:00.0/driver/unbind then my system freezes \n\nA: Because they are exactly the same hardware so it will show the same vendor id and same device id. The only difference between the 2 cards is the slot it is sitting in (probably the 1st part in your output). \nYou can use dmidecode –t slot to match it with the output from lspci -nn to identify them each but you can not tell KVM that.\nInteresting question though and generally I would leave it at \"you probably need another, different, card\" when I came across this: \nOn kernel.org it says that \"Writing a device ID to /sys/bus/pci/drivers/.../new_id will attempt to dynamically add a new device ID to a PCI device driver. This may allow the driver to support more hardware than was included in the driver's static device ID support table at compile time.  The format for the device ID is: VVVV DDDD SVVV SDDD CCCC MMMM PPPP.  That is Vendor ID,    Device ID, Subsystem Vendor ID, Subsystem Device ID, Class, Class Mask, and Private Driver Data.  The Vendor ID and Device ID fields are required, the rest are optional. Upon successfully adding an ID, the driver will probe for the device and attempt to bind to it. For example: # echo \"8086 10f5\" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/foo/new_id\" \nAnd that lead me to the command setpci and an U&L topic that suggests you can change the device ID of PCI cards. \nSo maybe you can change one of the 8080:aa68 to another device id with one of these 2 methods. Do pick an id that is a similar card but maybe a bit older or newer than the one you have. Changing it to a random device id will probably cause trouble. \n", "Q: reboot and shutdown command freeze on my Ubuntu vivid 15.04 Every time I have to reboot or shutdown the display keeps on showing the image of Ubuntu with the dots that keeps on going.\nEven with command from the terminal.\nI have to press the button to power off my laptop all the times.\nMy Laptop is an HP Compaq nx6310 32bit\nSomeone have a solutions?\nPS: I have the kernel version 4.2.1 final release\nThanks in advance\nLuca Tansini\n\nA: First this may be bug #1464917:\nIf this affects you please go there and let them know by clicking \"This affects me\" link above the initial bug description.\nAfter the shutdown or reboot has hanged with this message. \nReached target Shutdown\nYou may only see this if you have removed the splash screen.

EncFS works with a private and public folder where the public folder is the encrypted version that can be used to upload to an on-line service or across machines. If for example you place an unencrypted file inside the public folder it will be shared making the contents visible to anyone. \nIf you log in the private folder will not be mounted. A user that would assume something is broken and starts messing with it, instead of just mounting the private folder will loose data. Mind though that \"user\" here might not be \"you\". \n\nIs there a chance that using Cryptkeeper causes data loss?\n\nHere you are probably misunderstanding and also as an answer to your 2nd question: Cryptkeeper is a tool to make it easier to mount/unmount encypted folders. It has nothing to do with the actual encryption. That is done with EncFS.\nQuestion 3 is off topic but as a general answer: EncFS is not Ubuntu specific and can be used on all Linux systems. It will act the same on all those systems; only the method of installation will differ (rpm, yast instead of apt-get). Regarding Windows: there is an experimental implementation of EncFS call EncFSWin. To me an indication to stay away from it unless you make sure to keep the originals away from it (if \"experimental\" means you someday face an unrecoverable bug you still have the originals). \n", "Q: Running python script from django views Want to run a python script from django views. And I dont want to wait till the script execution. The python script should do its work in the background and in the meanwhile, I will send response to the client that \"the script is running in the background\". Any Idea?\n\nA: As soon as you say \"do it in the background\" I'm going to suggest Celery . It involves running RabbitMQ as a local daemon that Celery uses as a intermediate data-store and Django can ask Celery to perform tasks.\nIf you need to track status, once you add a task, you can get a UUID for it and then query Celery for the status, and/or just have Celery stick the result in the standard Django ORM for you that you poll (or use webhooks, or whatever it is hipsters are using these days).\n\nThat is, of course, a lot of learning and a fair amount of ongoing burden for just running something in the background. You can just do it the dirty subprocess.Popen way. You won't capture any output or get any status... But it should just about work.\n\nA: subprocess.Popen is best if you want to send immediate response. But make sure that subprocess.Popen is not returning any value back. i.e., you have to use like below:\nsubprocess.Popen([\"python\",\"test.py\"], close_fds=True)\n\nAnd use close_fds=True along with that, also helps better.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get a usable Ubuntu 15.04 running in Virtual Box on OS X?

To cut a long story short: I have a specific case with application run in Wine. The thing is this application is not seeing my sound input device when this device is grabbed by PulseAudio. Unfortunately setting profile of this device to 'off' in Pulse Audio Control is not working properly, device is still somehow grabbed. I proved it by killing pulseaudio deamon - then application can see my recording device. But the problem is I have to have PulseAudio enabled in the same time for OUTPUT devices, otherwise I cannot hear the sound outputted by this application. \nSo the question is : how to config pulse audio (or recording device) in such a way that it won't be even 'seen' by pulse audio?\nI am using ubuntu 14.04\nEDIT : I found this : https://jamielinux.com/blog/tell-pulseaudio-to-ignore-a-usb-device-using-udev/\nDevice dissapears from pulseaudio panels but pulseaudio still somehow blocks application from using my recording device.\n\nA: Adapted from: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1551820&page=2. Worked for me in Ubuntu 20.04\nIf you don't have PulseAudio Volume control installed:\nsudo apt install pavucontrol\n\nThen run pavucontrol in a terminal or via your desktop.\n\n*\n\n*First select the Output Devices tab and make sure the drop down in the\nlower right corner is set to All output devices.\n\n*Then select the Configuration tab.\n\n*Find the device you want Pulse to ignore and select off in the profile drop-down.\n\nIn Ubuntu 20.04 I still saw the device in the sound options, but it did indeed seem to be available for use with Alsa. In my case the device is a USB DAC connected to my hifi amp. I am planning to set up MPD on that output but have not gotten that far. I did test with VLC by changing its audio configuration to ALSA and selecting the raw \"hardware\" device.\nThis profile setting seems to be remembered across reboots. I have not tested disconnecting and reconnecting the USB device but the referenced forum post indicate that it should work:\n\n... by following the above instruction, I could get a particular driver to be ignored by setting it to \"Off\" in pavucontrol - proof is that I can insmod/rmmod the driver multiple times without pulseaudio getting a lock on it - even if pulseaudio recognizes the driver as loaded (and indeed, shows it in pavucontrol when it is).\n\n\nA: As it has been said, you need to install pavucontrol (Pulse Audio Control).\n\n*\n\n*Open pavucontrol, by selecting Super + \"pulse audio\".\n\n\n*Go to Config tab.\n\n\n*Select the profile \"turned off\" or \"disabled\" for the device you want to keep turned off.\n\n\n*Then click on the 'lock' icon at the right. That will keep the selected profile for that device, no matter if you disconnect it and then reconnect it.\nAs it's shown in the following image:\n\n", "Q: Failed to download repository information ubuntu 14.04 I am a new user of Linux migrating from Windows.

Actually I have feeling that grep is not a good choice at all in this case.\nHow to solve my problem?\n\nA: you can use find. In your case you can run\nfind -maxdepth 1 -iname 'jre*'\n\nExplanation:\nfind searches for files/directories with the given parameters: -maxdepth 1 restricts the search to the current directory. Otherwise, it would search in all subdirectories too. -iname takes the pattern and searches case insensitive. The pattern itself 'jre*' means the string should begin with \"jre\" and the continue with a arbitrary number of cahracters.\nAlternatively, if you want to use grep:\nls | grep -i '^jre'\n\n-i toggles case-insensitive search and the ^ results in finding only matches with \"jre\" at the beginning\n\nA: Find should do the trick:\nfind . -iname 'jre*'\n\n", "Q: GUI program to record internet radio with songs tags (title, artist, etc.)? In Windows I like Screamer Radio, and I know that are others like RarmaRadio, programs which can record radio music and also save the proper titles, artist names, etc.\nIs there such a program in Ubuntu?\n\nI am looking for a native linux program, but Wine-based solutions are welcomed as a second choice. I will also try Wine myself and provide an answer.\nAlso, although I am looking for a program that would record songs with tag names, I am not aware of a Linux program that can record radio songs separately (split) even without tag names and titles. - So, a such program may deserve to be mentioned too.\nAnother basic desirable features that need mentioning are:\n\n\n*\n\n*playing songs while recording\n\n*large database of stations\n\n*possibility of adding new stations\n\n*recording multiple stations at the same time\n\n\n\nI have posted a complementary answer limited to the use of Windows programs in Wine.

Two issues need attention though:\n\n*\n\n*the tags-saving feature is disabled by default for some reason. So, enable it under 'File-Settings-Posprocessing' and in 'File-Settings for automatic recordings-Posprocessing'. The fully tagged file will be saved in a separate folder at the end of each track. During recording the incomplete file will not be tagged.\n\n\n*recording works only if the path to the folder to save songs starts with C:\n\nChanging that to Z: gives an error on lacking disk space.\n\nA: You can use StreamTuner2 with [Streamripper (https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/streamripper/) (Install streamripper) to record Online Radio Streams.\nTo Grap Streamripper in terminal just do this:\nsudo apt-get install streamripper \n\nStreamripper and streamtuner2 are Linux applications that work in tandem, allowing you to listen and record streaming radio.\nStreamtuner2 is a basic application used primarily for playing internet radio from any number of sources including Xiph, basic.ch, punkcast.com, Google Stations, Live365, and SHOUTcast. It will use streamripper to record and an external player to play a stream.\n\nStreamtuner2 can add favourite stations to bookmarks. New stations can be added by selecting some station, right-click, Edit, 'New', and, after setting a new name and URL, OK and then Reload button.\nClicking the play button after selecting a station will start the radio station in external player. The same happens when double-clicking a station in a list.\nClicking the record button after selecting a station will run streamripper in a terminal window and by default each track will be saved separately in the Home folder.\nTo set custom folder for recordings in Streamtuner2, under 'Edit-Properties-Recording application', edit the line under 'Application' by adding -d path_to_folder at the end (like x-terminal-emulator -e streamripper %srv -d /home/user/Audio/Recordings). There can be added many other custom commands that streamripper allows - see below on more options.\nSearch function doesn’t work as it should.\nTo save in a custom folder by using just streamripper in a terminal (CLI, without Streamtuner), open the terminal in that folder.\nMultiple instances of streamripper (that is recording of multiple tracks) can be run at the same time in separate terminal windows. \n\nOn more options in Streamripper there are  Ubuntu Guide, Reference,Tutorial, Ubuntu Man Page, My Ubuntu Blogspot.\nStreamripper sits stealthily in the terminal recording and parsing all of the music piped through your system into MP3s. Leaving Streamripper running all day will rack you up a healthy dose of your favorite tunes. By itself streamripper is able to record streams with the command:\n$ streamripper <URL>\n\nWhat is particularly nice about the combination of Streamripper and streamtuner2 is that once you choose a station to record, you can exit streamtuner2 leaving only a tiny, non-obtrusive terminal window for Streamripper.\n\nA: The Exaile music player for a long time has had the ability to use Streamripper built-in. Just install Exaile and Streamripper, then enable it in the preferences gui of Exaile,you'll find it with all the other plugins. That's it, just hit the record button while listening to your favorite radio station. \n", "Q: nmcli dev connect? nmcli has an option to disconnect a device ( nmcli dev disconnect iface mydevice) but it doesn't have a connect command.

Is it possible to scale everything to 720p but keep the resolution 1080p?\nI tried using Accessibility, but that doesn't scale everything.\n\nA: Yes you can, go in : Parameters > Display and set  “Scale for menu and title bars” to the value that is best suited for you.\n\nIt will scale all your desktop while keeping your original 1080p resolution.\n\nA: Making reference to the image that @hg8 shared, you can also try the option \"Scale all windows contents to match:\".

I followed the instructions here: How do I install the latest TeX Live 2012?\nbut I now get error messages such as \"ulem.sty not found\". What did I do wrong?\n\nA: Use the following command sequence:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:texlive-backports/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install texlive-full\n        \n\nThis will get you the complete TeXLive package constellation.

The servers don't have a domain, only an IP address which is hard to remember when I got a few of them.\nIs there a way to permanently store values in the terminal, so that I can do the following?\nserver1 = 111.222.111.222\n\nAnd type commands like:\nssh root@server1\n\ninstead of:\nssh root@111.222.111.222\n\n\nA: Of course for your particular issue you want to follow @chaos and @steeldriver advices, but in the general case, in order to \"permanently store values in the terminal\", you are looking to shell variables.  How to set them will depend on your shell (I guess echo $SHELL will provide the relevant information).\nIf by \"permanently\" you mean \"as long as I don't exit this terminal session\", then you can simply use the export server1=111.222.111.222 command if you're using a bash-based shell (setenv server1 111.222.111.222 for a csh/tcsh-based shell, if I remember correctly).  Then you can access your variable by prefixing it with $ : ssh root@$server1.\nIf by \"permanently\" you mean \"each time I launch a new terminal\", then you will need to set your variable in one of the shell init files.  E.g. in $HOME/.bashrc for bash-based shells, or $HOME/.cshrc — presumably using the same syntax as mentionned in the previous paragraph.  Note that you will have to source the init file (e.g. source $HOME/.bashrc or open a new shell for changes to be taken into account.\nNB : Answer from memory, may require some small adjustments.\n\nA: For SSH connections, you can create a user configuration file ~/.ssh/config and place the mappings there e.g.\nHost server1\n  Hostname      111.222.111.222\n\nYou can easily add other fields such as Port (for non-standard ports) and User (useful if your username on the remote system differs from that on the local system). See man ssh_config for full details.\n\nA: Yes, just write them down in the file /etc/hosts. It has the following syntax:\n1.2.3.4 servername additional_servername\n\nWhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*1.2.3.4 is the IP address\n\n*servername is the name\n\n*additional_servername is an optional name\n\n\nAfter saving, you can reach the server by its name.\n\nA: Not a direct answer to the question (chaos and steeldriver have already provided what I think would be the best literal solutions), but if you only need to ssh to the one user at the one address in the majority of cases, then looking at editing the .bash_aliases file in your home directory should be useful, as you can create an alias for the entire terminal command.\n\nA: The specific answers are very good.\nIn general, though, if you want to have some things defined/setup in a shell, just write a script to do it and then execute it with source or . when you want that setup in effect.\nIf it's something you want all the time, you can source it in .profile (for login shells) or in .bashrc for all shells (if you use bash).\nWith an approach like this, you can have multiple scripts to setup different working environments as needed as long as you make sure they don't step on each other if you invoke one of them after invoking another one first.   \n", "Q: Ubuntu Server automaticly connect to VPN at boot I need to set up a server out in the field.

You can do that either from within Windows or by choosing the Try Ubuntu option when you boot the LiveUSB/LiveDVD and using GParted to resize the Windows partition.\nFor more information about how to install Ubuntu I would suggest you look here or here.

My question is how can I get a more recent version -- ideally using, 1) a package manager that figures out other dependencies and 2) using binary packages so I don't have to compile from source?\nWhen I look at packages.ubuntu.com I see some of the proposed python3-pandas versions for future Ubuntu releases.  For example wily uses 0.15.0 and I can get to source packages at this site.\nI have also stumbled on binary packages at launchpad.net.\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can download the .deb files from launchpad.net mentioned above and then try installing with dpkg -i.  This fails as expected because of missing dependencies.  I could probably find those, download, and install as well, but seems like there should be a better way.\n\n*The pandas site, gives the instructions sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pythonxy/pythonxy-devel && sudo apt-get update, followed by sudo apt-get install python-pandas, but this doesn't seem to work.  Kind of looks like the pythonxy ppa doesn't have a python3 version of pandas?\n\n\nIt seems like what I need to do is tell apt-get about the package repository that appears to exist at launchpad.net.  But I can't seem to figure out how to do that.  \n\nA: I have run into a similar problem before. There are two possible solutions:\nUse pip\npip is a package manager for python. With pip${version} you can install packages for a specific python version.\nGeneral info about pip\nInstalling pip (basically sudo apt-get install pip)\nThere are also ways to install the packages for all users (as root), or only locally.\nBackporting\nIf you need a .deb package, for whatever reasons (for example if other users want to download your product from the repository with all dependencies in the repo), you can \"backport\" the packages from Wily. That means building the (source) package with all its dependencies and putting them in a PPA/requesting backport to Trusty (backports package source).\nUsing backports and requesting/making them\nI did the latter one a few days ago for the package python-cryptography.\nYou will need a launchpad.net account and you will need a GPG key. There you have to create a PPA (for example \"python-pandas-backport\"). Then just follow the second link. I did a requestbackport -d trusty <package> and then you get a text file where you have the command for backportpackage. \nYou enter the backportpackage command in another window. It's mostly pretty straight forward. Then you can check your PPA on launchpad to see why/if the build has failed. That's how I found the dependencies, and for all those packages I repeated the process above (with the same PPA, mind you). If you know the deps, you can just backport them first.\nYou can then use the packages from your own PPA and anyone else can too. If you have requested a backport, they might land in Trusty. But that may take a while (Wily will be released in a month, so it's crunch time).\n", "Q: few lines insert in existing file via terminal? i have file test.txt\nhi\nhello\ngood luck\n\ni want in this test.txt\nhi\nhello\ngood luck\nlms\nlocalhost\n\nhow to add last two lines in terminal command\n? \n\nA: Run\necho -e \"lms\\nlocalhost\" >> test.txt\n\n\\n is for a new line.\n>> redirects output to a file and appends it to the end of the file.\n-e is to parse control characters like \\n.\n", "Q: Totem 3.10 -no audio mpeg4 aac after 4 seconds- I've a new camcorder Canon and problems with audio when playing on Totem (Ubuntu 14.04). \nThe firts 4 seconds sounds perfect, but after then remains silent, with no audio.\nThe video is perfect, also at 35Mbps when other players fails (Vlc, Mplayer), thats why I need to fix the audio issue.\nThanks in advance,\n\nA: Run Totem again with system monitor opened (sudo isn't necessary).\nCheck CPU usage of Totem - If at 99% or 'Over' Typically hardware isn't able to keep up with the demands of the file being accessed.\nCodecs are typically CPU-Hogs.\nPerhaps try a faster system for best results.\n", "Q: Trouble with devices and USB ports I have been trying to play Xwing vs Tie fighter on Linux Ubuntu Mate in virtualbox with my playstation 3 controller. \nAfter a few attempts It worked but I rebooted and it stopped working. \nIf I load my snapshot from when it worked, it works again. \nUsing dmesg | grep sony I saw 2 changes occurring between when it works and when it doesn't. \nNote that the system always gets input and when it doesn't work the system just doesn't transfer the input to the game.\nExample of when it works:\n[ 1724.864749] sony 0003:054C:0268.0008: input,hiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.11 Joystick [Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller] on usb-0000:00:06.0-1/input0 \n\nExample of when it doesn't work: \n[ 1316.913893] sony 0003:054C:0268.0007: input,hiddev0,hidraw1: USB HID v1.11 Joystick [Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller] on usb-0000:00:06.0-2/input0\n\nThe first change I noticed was the change of hidraw0 to hidraw1.\nThe second change I noticed was the change of USB port: usb-0000:00:06.0-1 to usb-0000:00:06.0-2.\nMy mouse pointer of the VirtualBox is recognized as a device (Virtualbox USB Tablet) and is the cause of the issue: when the controller works, the mouse pointer is on usb 2-2 and on hidraw1.

Also, I have no idea how to post terminal output properly in the forums, so feel free to toss that out so I can clean up my post.\nEdit: Thank you for the editing help gman! Still dunno how you did it :)\nEdit: Installed xsensors 0.70 and it has an i8k tab and a coretemp tab. In the i8k tab I see my temperatures and then my rightfan speed says 84,000 RPM even though it isn't running. The core temps seem to be correct though.\n\nA: Ok, so I \"think\" I fixed it, but it's being all wonky. I went into my i8kfan config file and set ALL configuration options to \"2\". I also found out that the -1, means no fan. So all my entries say something like:\n{-1 2} regardless of the heat settings.\nHere is the wonky part: my fan now turns up and down over time. Like high rev, low rev, back to high rev, back to low rev, etc... This happens at about 20 second intervals. At least it's keeping my CPU temp down.\nI am assuming I have a bad sensor somewhere in my laptop as I was getting a lot of odd readings (84k rpm on a fan that isn't on). Anywho, if someone else comes along and has a similar issue:\nsudo gedit /etc/i8kmon.conf\n\ngedit will open. Paste this in to have it try running your fan on HIGH ALL THE TIME:\n# Run as daemon, override with --daemon option\nset config(daemon)      0\n\n# Automatic fan control, override with --auto option\nset config(auto)        1\n\n# Report status on stdout, override with --verbose option\nset config(verbose) 1\n\n# Status check timeout (seconds), override with --timeout option\nset config(timeout) 20\n\n# Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\nset config(0)   {{-1 2}  -1  40  -1  40}\nset config(1)   {{-1 2}  30  60  30  60}\nset config(2)   {{-1 2}  53  128  53  128}\n\n# For computer with 2 fans, use a variant of this instead:\n# Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n# set config(0) {{-1 2}  -1  52  -1  65}\n# set config(1) {{-1 2}  41  66  55  75}\n# set config(2) {{-1 2}  55  80  65  85}\n# set config(3) {{-1 2}  70 128  75 128}\n\n# end of file\n\nI restarted my system after I saved the file and exited and now my fan is always on.\nHope this helps if someone else gets an issue like mine. Of course I'd be happy to vote a better solution if someone has it.\n\nA: The revving you mention has to do with competing control over fan speeds. In both the XPS 9560 and Precision 5520 fan RPMS are controlled by the BIOS. When you run a fan program like i8kutils or fancontrol, the software competes with the BIOS. Disabling the BIOS is a risky task if your not totally sure what you are doing. \nIt is outlined here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/5y3rii/xps_9560_battery_life_optimization_and_fan/\n", "Q: MAC changes back after 30 min or earlier I have lubuntu 14.04 system and need to change MAC for internet conncetion to work.\nI've done this:\nifconfig eth0 down\nifconfig eth0 hw ether MAC_ADRESS\nifconfig eth0 up\n\nBut repeatedly after 30 min or less original MAC is restored and I lose Internet connection.

It works just fine now with optirun.\nThe driver is called nvidia_352.\nNow I'm trying to get CUDA working. I can modprobe manually nvidia_352 and nvidia_352_uvm and it works as expected. However, if I haven't yet run modprobe manually, it tries to load the nvidia and the nvidia_uvm drivers and so it fails (as those drivers don't exist).\nThis is similarly the case if I try to use nvidia-modprobe.\nI suspect there is some underlying setting which is telling nvidia-modprobe to try to load the nvidia driver, but I don't know what that is. Does anybody have a suggestion?\nI guess a workaround is to explicitly load those drivers at boot, but they are currently blacklisted by bumblebee, so that wants to take control, and also I'm not sure of the power implications of loading the driver.\n\nA: I am working through a similar issue and I was able to fix it by editing my bumblebee conf.\nsudo vim /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf\n\nSet driver to nvidia\n# (See also the driver-specific sections below)\nDriver=nvidia\n\nInside the nvidia specific driver section I added the name of the module which in my case nvidia-352\n## Section with nvidia driver specific options, only parsed if Driver=nvidia\n[driver-nvidia]\n# Module name to load, defaults to Driver if empty or unset\nKernelDriver=nvidia-352\n\nI needed to include the driver path which wasn't correct by default. Look through /usr/lib/ and /usr/lib32/. In my case I don't seem to have 32bit drivers... but if I did they would be on the LibraryPath separated by a comma. \nI also needed to add the XorgModulePath.\n# colon-separated path to the nvidia libraries\nLibraryPath=/usr/lib/nvidia-352\n# comma-separated path of the directory containing nvidia_drv.so and the\n# default Xorg modules path\nXorgModulePath=/usr/lib/nvidia-352,/usr/lib/xorg/modules\n\nAfter doing a little more research I found an excellent guide that helped me complete my project.\nhow-to-install-nvidia-drivers-with-bumblebee-on-ubuntu-14-04\n\nA: To fix this problem (in addition to @McKayMatt's answer), I wrote  pair of scripts to do the loading explicitly:\nThe first is a preload script, preload_nvidia_module.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\nsudo modprobe nvidia-352-uvm\neval \"$@\"\n\nwhich is called from another script cuda_run:\n#!/bin/sh\noptirun --no-xorg preload_nvidia_module.sh $@\n\nSo now the cuda program can be run as:\ncuda_run my_cuda_program\n\nand all the module loading and unloading happens automagically.\nI dare say these scripts can be combined if you possess more bash fu than I do.\n", "Q: Configuration for green tty's foreground and boot text after grub menu I have set up my system (Ubuntu 14.10) for a text boot up. I need to configure my ttys and boot in such a way that it shows green font for boot messages and ttys.Right now, after the grub menu(which comes in green font) loads, the messages show up all in white color and for ttys it shows up like this(all in white) after boot up :\n\nUbuntu 14.10 UTM tty1\nUTM login :\n\nI want to make it green in color.\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*writing setterm -foreground green -store in bashrc changes up the color to green but only after when I try to re-login (logging in and then logging out of tty).\n\n*I looked up various links and found that I should modify my /etc/inittab file but as ubuntu 14.10 doesn't have a inittab file I don't know which file I should edit/create for this task.\n\n*Changed the GRUB_NORMAL_COLOR=green/black in /etc/default/grub but it only changes the grub font color to green but after it loads the booting starts and all messages come up white in color.\n\n\nSo, my question is , Which file should I edit/create for tty's font color and how ? And also for boot text color?\n\nA: If you take a look through /etc/init folder, the command responsible for bringing up TTY is getty. For each TTY there is a *.conf file in /etc/init , so if you want colorized prompt on every TTY, you will have to edit every single one of those files. \nNow, the file responsible for the contents of that appear on the screen before logging in is /etc/issue, however, getty allows specifying custom issue file with -f flag. You can either do that, or edit original /etc/issue file. Be aware that this file will be overwritten with the next upgrade to newer Ubuntu release. \nAs for colorizing that text, it's pretty easy: use \\[ escape sequence and the code for non-print character. \nIn particular , to make the prompt green, do this:\nsudo bash -c 'echo -e \"\\033[1;32m My Laptop \\n \\l \" > /etc/issue '\nWhy not sudo echo ? Because redirection is done by the shell,and unless you are logged in as root, your shell doesn't have permission to write to root-owned file (same as explained here).  \nWhy not add \\033[1;32m manually ? Because then it's treated as text.\nHere's hexdump before and after editing file\nCURRENT DIR:[/home/xieerqi]\n$ echo -e \"\\033[1;33m TEST MESSAGE\" > issue2                                    \n\nCURRENT DIR:[/home/xieerqi]\n$ hexdump -c issue2                                                             \n0000000 033   [   1   ;   3   3   m       T   E   S   T       M   E   S\n0000010   S   A   G   E  \\n                                            \n0000015\n\nCURRENT DIR:[/home/xieerqi]\n$ nano issue2                                                                   \n\nCURRENT DIR:[/home/xieerqi]\n$ hexdump -c issue2                                                             \n0000000   ^   [   [   1   ;   3   3   m       T   E   S   T       M   E\n0000010   S   S   A   G   E  \\n                                        \n0000016\n\nIn simple words, we want special characters there , not just text\n/etc/issue is root owned, so you will need to edit it with gksu gedit /etc/issue or sudo nano /etc/issue.

Sorry about formatting, I'm still trying to get the hang of it.\n\nA: This problem can happen when you unplug the drive or interrupt it while it is still active. The controller of the drive notices that something went wrong and marks the drive as 'dirty'. It is about the same what can happen with a regular hard drive. A hard drive can usually be repaired by performing automatically or manually a repair action. With flashdrives it is a matter of good or bad luck. Sometimes it can be repaired, sometimes it enters a read-only state like yours did and unfortunately this is irreversible.

I have not found a solution from those other questions so I am asking a new and unique question.\nHere is what my network looks like normally:\nCableModem <-- Router <-- 48 port GigE switch <-- LAN: many wired devices (printers and Ubuntu computers) plus several wireless clients that connect to the router.\nHere is what I want it to look like when Comcast goes down:\nPhone's 4G Internet <-- Router <-- 48 port GigE switch <-- LAN: many wired devices (printers and Ubuntu computers) plus several wireless clients that connect to the router.\nI will start by outlining the possible approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect my phone to my router via USB cable. My router has USB ports. Enable USB tethering on the phone.\n\n*Enable Mobile Hotspot mode on my phone. Connect router to phone (e.g. as WDS wireless bridging or whatever mode is appropriate). Router obtains Internet access through phone.\n\n*Connect my phone to a Kubuntu laptop via USB cable. Enable USB tethering on the phone. Share this Internet connection to my router by connecting a cable from eth0 on laptop to WAN / Internet port on the router.\nI prefer choice 1, but that functionality appears to be limited to specific routers. Can anyone tell me which routers support this? Another option is to use dd-wrt. Unfortunately, my present router is a Netgear R8000 and I don't think there is a stable version of dd-wrt for it (that supports openvpn, ssh tunneling, etc). I already spent time research dd-wrt. So I'm moving on to a Kubuntu-focused solution.\nI understand that choice 2 will cut my bandwidth in half, so I will use that option only if I can't get the others to work.\nThe reason I'm here is to focus on option 3. (However, I am open to suggestions regarding getting any of these approaches to work.)\nI have laptops with both Kubuntu 12.04 and 14.04. Let's assume I keep using 12.04 for this, which is what I've been working with so far. Here is what I have done already:\nI created a new network connection called tethered_usb0. I restricted it to interface usb0. I enable DHCP client mode. \nI connected a usb cable between my phone and my laptop. I enabled usb tethering on my phone. I now have working Internet access through this connection on my laptop. Here are the details:\nType:  Wired Ethernet\nConnection State:  Connected\nIP Address:  192.168.42.3\nConnection Speed:  Unknown\nSystem Name:  usb0\nMAC Address: <redacted>\nDriver:  cdc_ether\n\n(BTW, I edited the standard network connection called auto_eth0 and restricted it to interface eth0.)\nI created a new network connection called shared_connection. I restricted it to interface eth0.\nI connected a cat5e cable between eth0 on the laptop and the WAN/Internet port on the router. I connected to this connection using KDE's network manager. It said \"connected\".\nI went into the router GUI and set its WAN/Internet port to a static IP address of 192.168.42.4 and a gateway of 255.255.255.0. \nUnfortunately, my router is not getting Internet access. I rebooted the router several times and I tried variations on my settings. No luck.\nWhat next?\n\nA: I got it working. Here are the steps I used. I have a Kubuntu laptop with one ethernet port and several usb ports. I have a 4G Android phone with a tethering plan. \nFirst, to access KDE's network manager in Kubuntu click the tray icon that looks like a connection and then click \"Manage Connections...\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Using KDE's network manager in Kubuntu I edited the standard network connection called auto_eth0 and restricted it to interface eth0. That makes sense from the nomeclature perspective. (While you can probably skip this step, without it the default connection settings mean that the usb0 connection is made through the connection named auto_eth0, creating a source of confusion.)\n\n*Still using KDE's network manager in Kubuntu I created a new network connection named tethered_usb0. I restricted it to interface usb0. I enable DHCP client mode. All other settings are default.\n\n*I connected a usb cable between my phone and my laptop. I enabled usb tethering on my phone in the Android settings under \"Tethering and networks\". If Kubuntu doesn't automatically get an Internet connection, open the network manager tray icon and click on the connection named tethered_usb0. It will connect. I now have working Internet access through this connection on my laptop. \nHere are the details of this connection:\nType:  Wired Ethernet\nConnection State:  Connected\nIP Address:  192.168.42.3\nConnection Speed:  Unknown\nSystem Name:  usb0\nMAC Address: <redacted>\nDriver:  cdc_ether\n\n\n\n*Next I connected a cat5e (ethernet) cable between the only physical ethernet port on the laptop and the WAN/Internet port (where the cable modem would normally connect) on the router. It is a normal (straight through) cable.\n\n*Still using KDE's network manager in Kubuntu I created a new network connection called shared_connection. I left all settings as default. You need to click on the connection named shared_connection in network manager to activate this connection. \nThe connection details are:\nType:  Wired Ethernet\nConnection State: Connected\nIP Address:  10.42.0.1\nConnection Speed: 100 MBit/s\nSystem Name: eth0\nMAC Address: <redacted>\nDriver: e1000e\n\n\n\n*Note that there are now two active connections on the Kubuntu laptop: tethered_usb0 and shared_connection. Both are required.\n\n*I went into the router GUI and set its WAN/Internet port to a static IP address of 10.42.0.2 and a gateway of 10.42.0.1. The subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. Note that I used a different computer to connect to my router. I used any computer on my lan. The router has the same address it always had and accessing the router's GUI is the same as before. My LAN IP address range is not the same as any of the addresses listed above. My router is a DHCP server. In short, the LAN side of the router does not change at all in this process. \n\n*Optional. Because my cable modem internet connection is not reliable, I have a frequent need to do the steps above. Therefore, I plan to purchase a fanless Intel NUC (or similar), install Kubuntu 14.04 on it, and leave it by my router. That way I won't have to dedicate a laptop to this job. I also purchased an extra phone line. (T-Mobile USA has a great deal right now called 10G 4 All.) For a very reasonable cost I now have a backup Internet service for when Comcast goes down. (This week it was down all day Monday, part of Tuesday, part of Thursday and now it has been down all day Friday as of 9pm.)\n", "Q: VMBox and Wine? I support software for a homeowners association which has evolved to Windows 7 using Office 2007(especially Access with a lot of VisualBasic and reports) and Quickbooks as the principal data repositories.  I don't expect to be able to continue the support much longer and I don't like what I see in Windows 8 and can't even contemplate Windows 10.  I've used Ubuntu in dual-boot situations for years and believe that it may offer a way to continue the legacy programs through the use of Wine and/or VMBox.\nI gather that Wine won't run Quickbooks and maybe not Access with VBasic.  Has anyone faced a similar situation?  Can you recommend VMBox with Ubuntu as the host, running Win7 to support Office 2007 and Quickbooks?\nAny thoughts will be appreciated.\n\nA: You may already know, you can see how Wine supports different applications here. For example, more recent versions of Quickbooks seem to be supported by Wine (link).\nAlthough, I'm running Ubuntu 15.04 and I have found that not all of the supported programs run with Wine yet. Also, VMBox hasn't worked for me on  15.04. Maybe you should choose an earlier distribution?\nBy the way, on Windows 7, with an i7 processor (generation 4), VMBox runs Ubuntu terribly slow; I imagine running a Windows OS on VMBox would be worse.  \n\nA: My PC with the following specs:\n6G RAM\n4x Intel Core i5-4440S CPU @ 2.80 GHz\n64-bit Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\n\nruns Win 7, 8.1, and 10 superbly in VirtualBox.  I have installed and run the full version of Microsoft Office in the Win 7 virtual machine.  The only Windows apps I have found that don't work satisfactorily are graphics-intensive games.\n", "Q: Can't load Windows 10 on fast boot setting I updated to windows 10 a week ago. For class purposes, I needed to install ubuntu. I installed ubuntu 14.04, but then had to delete it for some reason. I deletrd the Linux partition feom windows 10(on fast boot setting ), then when I try to restart the windows it directly takes me to grub command line. As I read in other posts that it might be a problem with windows mbr being replaced, and for that I will have to usr a windows recovery disk. But the problem is, due to fast boot setting in windows 10, I am not able to get the startup optins, therefore I am not able to boot from my USB disk. Any suggestions would be life saving.\n\nA: Try holding down the F2 Key while powering on, this should take you to your bios where you can disable the fast boot and allow you to boot from your live usb. If F2 does not work why not try all the F keys one at a time to find your system default haha but in most cases it is F2 \nHope this was helpful.\n", "Q: unsuported Ubuntu 12.10 I installed Ubuntu 12.10 (not realizing it was an old unsupported version).

Do I need to clean this up/remove the partial install and try again?  If so how should the clean up be done?

I thought that IPv6 might be the difference...  I've enabled IPv6 in bind and installed radvd on Ubuntu, that did not fix anything.  Actually it broke all my Androids, this is when I learned that Android does not support DHCP6.  I disabled radvd.\nTried: \n\n\n*\n\n*lowering MTU to 1200 on ppp0 and eth0\n\n*enabling IPv6 DNS\n\n*re building a new Ubuntu 14.04\n\n\n\nI don't believe that anything changed on my gateway.  Althought I now remember that I've tried installing the ESXI VMWare tool that comes with ESXI and that failed miserably and may have broken something.  I've removed the extra bridges the install created.\nHas anyone experienced such a thing?  I've seen many posts where people's browser got stuck on cdn.optimizely.com, but no real solution.  I've even tried disabling optimizely with \nhttp://www.meteomedia.com/?optimizely_opt_out=true\nand that did not fix anything (which is why I believe the problem is before) and might be in the redirection.\nKind Regards for any help,\nMartin Politick.\n\nA: I believe the problem is with the Zyxel VSG1432-B101 when in Bridge mode.\nI'm posting this as informational only.\nSolution:\nPlace Zyxel VSG1432-B101 in router mode\n- then place Ubuntu behind the NAT as 192.168.1.2\n- then set DMZ to be 192.168.1.2\n- use Ubuntu as used in the past.\nThe problem with this solution is that my VPN is double NATed, \nonce by the Zyxel, then by my Ubuntu server. It also frustrates me to the highest point that I was unable to get the Zyxel to work in Bridge mode...\nI believe that the fact that I'm using the same firewall settings and the same Ubuntu server behind the routed Zyxel with no problem proves that the problem is in the Zyxel when it is in Bridge mode.\nThe only thing that is different is that I'm not using the PPPoE from Ubuntu, but the one from Zyxel.\nThe rest stayed identical...\nThe PPPoE from Ubuntu seem to work properly as I had great scores at the bandwidth tests and with most (simple) websites. The Zyxel did not show ANY problems on the VDSL statistics page even with Ubuntu.\nMartin Politick 2015.\n", "Q: root takes up entire internal hard drive I have a 500 GB internal hard drive and I cannot paste anything to it.

I am working with a 3.19.0.26 kernel, 15.04 Ubuntu (32 bit), and a Dell Inspriron 3451.  Some have suggested adding programs to the sleep.d folder (although this has not led to success for me, yet), others have suggested setting acpi=off in the boot loader options (also, not successful for me). Others have suggested moving to the upstream kernels (have not tried yet), and I am aware that these particular models are not certified by Canonical for Hibernate or Hybrid Suspend, but I do not yet understand if this rules out all options. Even a \"stay running\" option would be preferable. \nAll I am hoping to do is to have a valid OS when I re-open the lid.   It is not clear to me which path I might pursue - boot options, programs in sleep.d, etc. I'd welcome tactical advise and I am running from place to place without a plan.\nSuggestions sought.\nR\n\nA: Is this laptop running on the newer Intel Atom SoC CPUs by any chance (Celeron / Pentium Nxxx)?\nDid you experience problems while installing the system or did you take any advanced options (turning of ACPI before the installation, etc.)?\nAs far as I know, this problem is common with the above mentioned processors and the only solution I've found so far was to blacklist the module \"dw_dmac\", by doing the following:\nOpen a terminal window, then enter:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nIn the opened file, add the following lines:\nblacklist dw_dmac\nblacklist dw_dmac_core\n\nThen save with Ctrl+O and close the file with Ctrl+X.\nNow, hibernation should work.\nIf this does not work for you, I don't see an option for you besides reinstalling the system. You could either try the new kernel on 15.10 when it is released tomorrow or go back to 12.04, which should work reliably for you, if you are not in need of using a newer version, at least for a while.\n", "Q: Ubuntu blank login screen after installing kubuntu 15.04 with plasma, only guest login is possible I was using ubuntu 15.04 above that I installed kubuntu with plasma desktop.

For example, databases run significantly faster.\n\n*Some software is slightly larger when compiled for 64-bit due to its use of 64-bit pointers, but the additional performance and the ability to have large amounts of RAM installed (over 3GB per application, or over ~3.5GB total) overcome this.\n\n", "Q: Problem in installing g++ I want to install g++ on my laptop(ubutu 14.04 LTS), however it shows the following errors-\n\nmaddman@MADDY-PC:~/Desktop$ sudo apt-get install g++\nReading package lists...

The safe way to accomplish what you are trying to do in Ubuntu 12.04 is to install the version of MySQL Workbench from the default Ubuntu repositories.  \nIn order to do this, you need to repair your package catalog. Fixing software center catalog says to open the terminal and run these commands: \nsudo apt-get remove mysql-workbench*  \nsudo dpkg --configure -a && sudo apt-get install -f  \n\nUnlike, python2.7, you can safely remove mysql-workbench without breaking anything else, and reinstall mysql-workbench later after your package catalog has been repaired. The sudo apt-get install -f command will only be executed if the sudo dpkg --configure -a command succeeds.  \nReviewing the packages that you have installed since you installed Ubuntu, the package that stands out is RStudio. There is an official RStudio .deb package here for Ubuntu 12.04, however you compiled RStudio from its source code because you couldn't install it from the .deb file. This is probably where you are getting your broken package catalog problem from. I suggest that you remove RStudio: If I build a package from source how can I uninstall or remove it completely?, repair your package catalog, install MySQL Workbench from the Ubuntu Software Center, and then the only problem left to solve will be how to reinstall RStudio without breaking anything else. \n", "Q: sudo: /var/lib/sudo writable by non-owner (040777), should be mode 0700 I get error message always when I work with sudo command.\nIt shows always sudo: /var/lib/sudo writable by non-owner (040777), should be mode 0700. \nA while ago I changed the permission of /var folder to 777. \nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: Open the terminal and type:\nsudo chown -R root:sudo /var/lib/sudo   \nsudo chmod -R 700 /var/lib/sudo  \n\nIf sudo still does not work, you'll have to fix it from a root shell from the GRUB menu by following the instructions from: How do I add myself back as a sudo user?. \n\nA: \"Writable by non-owner\" means that the current permissions of /var/lib/sudo allow either the file's group group or the file's other group to write into the directory, whilst only the owner (root) should be able to do so.\nRemoving the write permission for the group group and for the other group (chmod go-w /var/lib/sudo) should suffice, however since the suggested permissions are 0700, just go for those:\nsudo chmod 0700 /var/lib/sudo\n\n\nA: I was also face this problem , and I solve this problem.

I can see the incoming and outgoing traffic just fine. Now I want to see the traffic from other devices which are on my LAN. So, I did:  \n$ ifconfig wlan0 promisc\n\nNow I pick up my phone which is on the same network (LAN) and go to stackoverflow.com. Now I come back to wireshark stop the capturing and then filter the traffic with http but there is nothing. What did I miss?\n\nA: The question is not about Ubuntu, but what you're trying is technically not a way to sniff your LAN traffic. \nYou should perform a man-in-the-middle attack to draw all the traffic to your wire then use sniffing in promiscuous mode to capture all the data.\nTake a look at this blog for more info.\n\nA: I infer from \"wlan0\" that this is a Wi-Fi network.  That means you need to capture in monitor mode.  If this is a \"protected\" network, using WEP or WPA/WPA2 to encrypt traffic, you will also need to supply the password for the network to Wireshark and, for WPA/WPA2 networks (which is probably what most protected networks are these days), you will also need to capture the phone's initial \"EAPOL handshake\" when it joins the network, so you'd want to put your phone to sleep (turning it off should put it to sleep), start a capture, and then wake it up (turn it on) and access Stack Overflow.\nSee the Linux section of the \"how to capture on an 802.11 network\" page and the \"how to decrypt 802.11 traffic\" page on the Wireshark Wiki.\n", "Q: Won't complete hardware update 'Package operation failed'\nUnpacking fglrx-core (from .../fglrx-core_1%%3a14.201-0ubuntu2wataugafour2_amd64.deb) ...\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/fglrx-core_1%%3a14.201-0ubuntu2wataugafour2_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n trying to overwrite '/etc/acpi/fglrx-powermode.sh', which is also in package fglrx 2:14.201-0ubuntu1\ndpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/fglrx-core_1%%3a14.201-0ubuntu2wataugafour2_amd64.deb\nError in function: \nSystemError: E:Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\nA: As the error message said, the file /etc/acpi/fglrx-powermode.sh is part of both packages fglrx-core and fglrx.\nYou have two possibilities\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use the packages from a PPA or a downloaded deb if you don't know, how to use it\n\n\nOr\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the officially package fglrx via\nsudo apt-get remove fglrx\n\n", "Q: No desktop environment I installed gnome 3 on my ubuntu 14.04.

Installing it through vundle eased my way.\nUPDATE 2.0 (not a bug actually)-> The demon arrives again.The problem has started again even with the powerline.This time I noticed that this problem is connected with the *arrow-shaped triangular prompt * only. So , this is not a bug, basically a glitch somewhere I am missing.\n\nA: I solved the problem .I think the shell was not using ~/.local/lib/python2.7/...../bindings/bash/powerline.sh so I resourced it and restarted the system. \nI also added the path variable for powerline-config file in the ~/.local/bin/poweline directory in .bashrc and now, everything is working just fine.\n", "Q: Using IBUS for multiple language input A month ago or so I migrated from Mint 17.2 to Ubuntu 15.04 and am not regretting it at all, apart from one thing that's pretty annoying and I truly hope It's changeable.\nI type in more than 1 language, which requires me to use multiple input methods (right now I'm using English, Russian, Chinese and Korean). I'm using Ibus for this, both when using Mint and on Ubuntu. \nIbus on Mint works slightly different on using Ibus on Ubuntu: On Mint it will remember the last language you have been using, so when you use ctrl+space to go to the next language, it will go to the next language in the list but, and this is the great part of Ibus in Mint, if you press ctrl+space again it will go to the language you just used before, instead of going to the next language in the list. This is an extremely handy feature of IBUS in Mint. \nIn Ubuntu (and Windows for what it matters) You just have to ctrl+space you through the whole list in order, or use shift+ctrl+space to go back through the whole list which can get incredibly annoying and frustrating, especially if you've been working for a while. \nI'll show you what I mean by using an example:\nMint: Out of language 1,2,3,4,5 you want to use 1 and 4 for now. Things will go like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using language 1\n\n*ctrl+space  \n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space \n\n*Using language 4\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*Using language 1\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*Using language 4\n\n*ctrl+space  \n\n*Using language 1\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*Using language 4\n\n\netc, \nWhile IBUS on Ubuntu works like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using language 1\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*Using language 4\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*Using language 1\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*Using language 4\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*Using language 1\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*Using language 4\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*Using language 1\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*ctrl+space\n\n*Using language 4\n\n\nAs you can see, it's really easy to start mixing things up and get kind of really frustrated in the process. Also, on Mint, Ibus will show a huge logo in the middle of the screen with the language are using and/or are changing to, while in Ubuntu the icons are just sitting on the task-bar. Do you know any way to change the way IBUS works on Ubuntu to the way it's working on Mint? Does such a possibility exist?\nThanks a lot in advance!  \n\nA: Whether it is Ubuntu, Mint, or Opensuse ibus is not properly configured to take certain customized Indian language based IM Engines. Ex: Kannada tables. Ibus identifies the tables and their icons, enlist them but not commit to anchor them to system-tray. Unless anchored on the system-tray keying is disaster. but I switched to SCIM and Fcitx. Even SCIM is better than Fcitx for adapting kannada language keying. \n", "Q: Screen tearing Intel Graphics 5500 What can I do to eliminate screen tearing and generally improve graphics performance?

I always have to follow this procedure, that I found on the net (https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/1155):\ndkms remove -m zfs -v 0.6.4.2 --all\ndkms remove -m spl -v 0.6.4.2 --all\ndkms add -m spl -v 0.6.4.2\ndkms add -m zfs -v 0.6.4.2\ndkms install -m spl -v 0.6.4.2\n\nLast command always leads to error in which case I have to run:\napt-get install --reinstall linux-headers-3.13.0-62 linux-headers-3.13.0-62-generic\n\nI also have to be careful to get the right versions each time. Which makes it even more painful.\nThis happens on nearly each system update that I run. I did have to tell my wife not to update, as this would most likely shut her out of the system.\nI hoped this to be a bug, that gets resolved, but its like this since a year now. I could not find a way to solve this permanently, is there?\nI use Kubuntu amd64 14.04\nuname -a\nLinux 3.13.0-62-generic #102-Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 11 14:29:36 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI'm fairly new to Linux so please be gentle :)\nUpdate: Modified the header version, to be in line with my uname output.\nAlso yes, I did not run dkms install -m zfs -v 0.6.4.2 since the command before already lead to an error. I understand that the \"add\" command in combination of an reinstall of the header has the same effect. I will test this next time anyway.\nUpdate2: Some additional bit of information. The default installation created a boot partition which is ridiculous small (230mb) and I try to not forget to clean it up from time to time but I have had several incidents where the update might not have enough space on the boot partiton to complete without error. I have absolutely no clue how dangerous this is and if my system is already long ago corrupted due to that. Since it happens so easily I hope its not a big deal thoug.\nUpdate3: This problem slvoed itself over time I guess this was a bug that got fixed.\n\nA: You get a package of zfs thats maintained faster, i.e. each release of the kernel, the maintainer is on it, and updates his code base for the new kernel right away. \nUsing arch linux, you will see that demizer updates the zfs-linux-git pretty much within a few days of the kernel being updated, which at that is always bleeding edge so he has his work cut out for himself for e.g.  \nUsing LTS packages, you will might see these problems compounded since LTS means to upgrade kernels sparingly, which is what leads to this issue in the first place.   \nThe best thing to do aside from that is to each time you update your system, when it warns you about the zfs, just wait and DONT update that day, and keep trying your update daily until the maintainer finally has released the new version when it no longer issues the warning.  If you practice this, your kernel will stay as updated as your zfs allows it, being at the mercy of your zfs package maintainer, and you will not have to ever rebuild zfs yourself, which is kind of a pain. \n\nA: It looks like linux-headers-generic package is not installed.\nThat is why linux-headers do not update with linux-image.\nRun in terminal\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nand you will always have the correct headers.\n", "Q: How to change the default TTL of TCP/IP packets?

To make this setting persistent across reboots you could append the following line to the file /etc/sysctl.conf:\nnet.ipv4.ip_default_ttl=129\n\nYou should do the same with ipv6 instead of ipv4 if you want to change the settings for ipv6 as well.\n\nA: for IPv6:\nThe other answer here says, \"You should do the same with ipv6\" but this does not work. IPv6 uses net.ipv6.conf.all.hop_limit and net.ipv6.conf.default.hop_limit. However, these values are overwritten by interface-specific names such as net.ipv6.conf.eth0.hop_limit.

If you have a separate home partition, do not format it.\nThese are options in the advanced partitioning section. This is the \"something else\" option, you can then manually review partitioning and ensure the root and / or home partitions are not formatted.\n\nSee : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuReinstallation\n\nSince Hardy it is possible to reinstall Ubuntu without losing the content of the /home folder (the folder that contains program settings, internet bookmarks, emails and all your documents, music, videos and other user files).

But I would also like to use Ubuntu, sometimes. Instead of making partitions on my hard disk, I would like to run Ubuntu with the USB drive. My question is that the changes I will make when I am on Ubuntu (like creating files etc.), where all these changes are gonna go? On the USB drive, right, not on my hard disk, since I haven't installed Ubuntu. \nAlso, is Ubuntu very slow when I try it with a USB drive?\n\nA: There are two kinds of Ubuntu Live systems- with Persistence and without persistence. If you make a persistent USB drive, the data you create during the session are saved in a casper-rw file. This changes are stored and reflected even after you reboot. A Live system without persistence is reset to the defaults each time it is shutdown.\nTo used  a casper-rw file that is larger than 4GB, you'll need to partition the pendrive. \nThe HDD remains unaltered as long as you do not explicitly modify a file from the hard drive itself.\nThe speed and performance of such live systems depends largely on the performance of the USB drive. I would say it isn't painfully slow and can be managed.\n\nA: The livecd system will charge needed components into the RAM from your usb stick. Every time you will launch a new program it will be loaded from the usb stick image.\nYou user profil is a temporary one and is absolutely not saved. Even if you saved a user folder and mount it as your home, you will have programs preferences but you will have to reinsall theses every time you boot with the usb stick.\nThe live CD system is no made for your use case. You may create a small partition on your disk and install ubuntu on this so you could have your stuff saved.\nYou can also install Ubuntu directly on your usb Stick. But it will be slow depending on the USB tech you have on your laptop and the usb key itself (usb2, usb3, etc).\nI would recommend a smaller distribution for this actually, see lubuntu, and co\nCheck this What is the smallest (installed size) ubuntu based distribution?\n", "Q: Error when trying to install wine i'm using UBUNTU 14.04 , and i want to install wine1.6 since it the latest stable version , i tried from the command line\nsudo apt-get install wine1.6\n\n\nLes paquets suivants contiennent des dépendances non satisfaites :\n wine1.6 : Dépend: wine1.6-i386 (= 1:1.6.2-0ubuntu4)\n           Recommande: winbind mais ne sera pas installé\nE: Impossible de corriger les problèmes, des paquets défectueux sont en mode « garder en l'état ».\n\nthe error is in french , with a translator to english i get :\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies :\nwine : Depends : wine1.6 but will not be installed or wine1.7 but will                                     \nnot be installed E: Unable to correct problems , defective packets are    \nmode \" keep state\n\nwhen trying to install it from the software center i get this :\napt://wine1.7\n\n    The following packages have unmet dependencies:\nwine1.7: Depends: wine1.7-amd64 (= 1:1.7.50-0ubuntu1) but 1:1.7.50-0ubuntu1 is to be installed\n         Depends: wine1.7-i386 (= 1:1.7.50-0ubuntu1) but it is a virtual package\n\n\napt://wine1.6\n    The following packages have unmet dependencies:\n    wine1.6: Depends: wine1.6-amd64 (= 1:1.6.2-0ubuntu4) but 1:1.6.2-0ubuntu4 is to be installed\n             Depends: wine1.6-i386 (= 1:1.6.2-0ubuntu4) but it is a virtual package\n\nUpdate :\ni have tried to install wine 1.6.2 from the source too\n./configure\nmake \nsudo make install\n\nafter that it seems that wine haven't been installed because when typing wine i get :\nwine : command not found\n\nAny hints ?\n\nA: You have to do this:\n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install wine winetricks\n\nand when it comes whit the screen push enter, and it might work fine this way.\n\nA: Run this command:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\nbefore you run\napt-get update\n\nThen you will be able to install wine.\n\nA: This error occurs when you try to install a package with apt-get, because there is a conflict with an already installed package.\nThe solution to this problem is to install the package with aptitude rather than with apt-get .

But there is a catch:\nYou must select the LAST option in the list of how to install it, and make choices that reflect where you want root (/) that reflects your current install, use the same format option (typically ext4), and make sure you do NOT click on the format box.  If you format, you will lose the.home directory and user accounts.  You will see a warning about not reformating, but you can safely ignore that and continue on.  \nYou will lose all your software updates, but you can get most of those back with a few commands in the terminal window:  I will show you here a simplified string of the two you need most:\nsudo apt-get -qq update\nsudo apt-get -qq -y update\nThe -qq limits the amount of messaging that appears on the screen during these processes.  Leave it out if you want to see everything.  The -ytells apt-get to just do it, and it does not stop to ask you (Yn).\nSome software does not get handled this way.  You have to deal with each one separately.  For instance, Virtualbox, Chrome, Chromium, Slimjet, and some other add-on software need to be reinstalled.\nAnother possibility is to install the same version of Linux on a different drive, then copy the /lib folder and contents over to your present drive.  You could use a USB thumbnail drive for this.  Ubuntu warns you that you need at least 6.5GB for an install though, and it may effect what you already have on the USB drive.  For that method to work, you have to have both drives mounted, and use the /media/ubuntu/ folder setup to access the drive(s).\nI say drives in plural, because you can do this from the LiveCD in Try mode, open a terminal, and type in sudo -su or sudo -i.  From the LiveCD, there is no password required to become super user.  Then you can use the mount command to mount each drive.  I won't explain the mount command here, but it isn't that hard, and you can find details elsewhere.\nWith both drives mounted. you use the cp -r command to copy from a source to a destination.  Unlike Windows, you cannot specify a current directory or folder on two separate devices.  Your current directory is limited to one place, which by default. is your /home/userid/.  You can use the cd command to change your current directory of you want, so lets assume you want to copy the /lib from sdb2 to sda1.  You could befin this way:\nsudo -i\ncd /media/ubuntu/sdb2     'assuming the drive is mounted already\ndir /media/ubuntu/sda1/lib   'see if the target directory alreasy exist,   which likely it doesn't\nmkdir /media/ubuntu/sda1/lib  'again, assuming sda1 has been mounted first\ncp -rpf . /media/ubuntu/lib/  'the period means from the current directory and the -rpf means -r to reiterate through subfolders, the p means don't change permissions, and the f means force an overwrite if it already exists.    \nYou could do it a bit simpler if you did it this way:\ncd /media/ubuntu/sdb1\ncp -rpf ./lib /media/ubuntu/sda1/ \nThe options pf -p  and -f may be overkill here, but they are quite handy under other circumstances of using the cp command, which of course stands for \"copy\".    \nNote the use of the period again.  Without it, you would be copying the contents of the/lib on the root drive over -- which might work.  But if doing this from the LiveCD, the contents of /lib are likely curtailed from having everything a full install of Ubuntu would have.   \nThe marvel of Linux is that /home need not be on the same drive or partition with root (/).  You could do a second drive/partition install, and during the install process, set it up to see /home on the original drive while seeing everything else on the new install drive.\nIn fact, the purpose of several drives and partitions can be managed this way. You just need to pick \"Something else\" as your install choice, then manage the configuration yourself.  This also lets you delete partitions, create new partition, change the format of partitions, and resize partitions.\nBut there are a few issues involved.  Linux identifies partitions on any one drive in the order they are created.  You can start with three partition on the sda drive, and they could be sda1, sda2, and swap.  Then you decide to downsiae sda1 and sda2 and add a third partition which should be sda3. It gets done, but because of the sequence order you followed in doing this, you end up with sda1, sda3, sda2, swap. You delete sda3, try to move sda2 down, and try to recreate sda3 where sda2 was.  Now you end up with sda1, sda2, sda3, swap.  The label sda3 is already taken, even though you deleted the partition.  So it is best to plan all this out ahead of time, then work down the list, from the first one to the last.  The swap partition can go anywhere.  I always put it last but others put it first.  Its generally sized at 1.5 time the a,ount od RAM you have, though I don't know why.  With less RAM, you would think you need more swap space, and the opposite with more RAM. since there is less need to swap.\n\nA: Seems like You had to do this as root so I don't think easy 'recovering' is possible.  \nFirst thing You could try is using some data recovering tool such as TestDisk. \nAnother option is just coping it from USB drive or CD after launching Ubuntu live session from it. Honestly that's only my guess, it may not work.\nThe last solution I can think of is reinstalling You system - You can do this saving Your data and some applications, not necessary loosing everything.\n", "Q: How do I play a video with audio from a separate file? (mux during playback) My laptop runs Xubuntu 14.04 LTS. I'm composing a score for a silent film, and I'm trying to \"Mickey Mouse\" it (synchronize notes to the action). I can tweak the silent film's editing slightly to line up events with beats of the music. The tool for making the film renders to a lossless intermediate (AVI with Huffyuv) at about 1 GB per two minutes, which I can encode to a compressed format (WebM with VP8 or MPEG-4 with AVC).\nIf I've already encoded the video, I normally use this command line to combine the compressed video with the score, based on avconv replace audio:\navconv -y -i the_video.mp4 -i the_audio.wav -map 0:0 -map 1:0 -c:v copy -c:a libvo_aacenc -ac 1 -ab 48000 -t 120 result.mp4\navplay result.mp4\n\nBecause the lossless intermediate is gigabytes in size, I don't want to use -c:v copy to copy those gigabytes every time I want to check my changes. Nor do I want to encode every time because my laptop's CPU (Atom N450, 1 core 2 threads) is too slow to encode full-size video in real time. But when I try to use a similar command line to play instead of encoding:\navplay -i the_video.avi -i sound/sticks.wav -map 0:0 -map 1:0\n\nI get the following error message:\navplay version 9.18-6:9.18-0ubuntu0.14.04.1, Copyright (c) 2003-2014 the Libav developers\n  built on Mar 16 2015 13:20:58 with gcc 4.8 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1)\nArgument 'sound/sticks.wav' provided as input filename, but 'hyf_enc.mp4' was already specified.\n\nGoogle \"avplay\" \"was already specified\" produced only source code results, not workarounds. I tried \"ffplay\" \"was already specified\" as well, but most pages with questions about that were related to overlaying a PNG, not muxing.\nHow should I play one file's audio and another file's video, with seeking linked between the two, without having to remux them to a file on the disk? Would a player in Ubuntu's repositories other than avplay work well for this? Or should I just shrink the lossless intermediate in order to make remuxing practical?\n\nA: My knowledge is based on the ffmpeg and ffplay tools which I understand to be replaced by avconv and avplay on Ubuntu which are supposed to be functionally equivalent (let's not debate on how far that functional equivalence goes).\nI don't think the play tools accept multiple inputs. You can stream via a pipe from ffmpeg (er, avconv) into ffplay (avplay). Try this:\n$ avconv -i the_video.avi -i sound/sticks.wav -map 0:0 -map 1:0 - | avplay -\n\nThe above is a guess based on your question but it's based on my own real example which I've pasted below just as a reference (yes I am using the ffmpeg and ffplay tools) :\nffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0,2 -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -f avi pipe:1 | ffplay -\n\n", "Q: After setting chmod -R 0700 still current user can see and edit the files I have a folder in my server I am setting this folder rights by \nsudo chmod -R 0700 myfolder\n\nwhen i print rights with ls -l everything is fine nobody has any right except root but i can open the file and even edit with the current user im signed in as .\nwhy the rights doesnt work proper according to chmod i am suposed not to be able to do anything with the contents of the folder\nid user and ls -ld folder output i am sharing below\n\n\nA: As the output of ls -ld node suggests the node directory is owned by user nikos (and group nikos), not by root with a permission of 700. As a result being user nikos you you have read, write, execute permission in that directory. \nAlso note that sudo chmod -R 0700 myfolder does not change the ownership to root, it simply sets the permission bits as 0700 as user root. If you are the owner of that directory you could do it by chmod -R 0700 myfolder, no need for sudo. \nThere is a catch though, as we are doing it recursively -R, you need to have the files under myfolder directory owned by you to change their permissions. Otherwise the original permissions of those files will prevail.\nNow if you want to make root as the owner of that directory and files under it (recursively):\nsudo chown -R root node\n\nIf you want to make the owner group as group root too :\nsudo chown -R root:root node\n\n", "Q: 14.04 on Macbook Pro connecting to wireless so I'm brand new to Linux and I just installed it as the single OS on my macbook pro.

I think the problem arose from me using the second set of steps Wild Man posted to use without an internet connection.

In my case I have my own scripts that run at startup anyway, and it just feels cumbersome to install an entire package to turn on numlock. My hope is that someone can tell me how to do this from the command line, so I can just slip it in an existing script.\nNote that I am not interested in turning numlock on for the login screen, which seems to be the focus of many similar questions. I want to do what can easily be done with numlockx, but by just adding a line or two to an existing script that runs on login. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: You can set the numlock state from within an SSH session by accessing /dev/console, which requires root permission (unless you change the permissions on /dev/console).\nAll of these commands assume that the user can execute sudo without a password.  This is often the case when the user is in a group called \"sudo\" or \"wheel\" depending on distribution and local configuration.\n# turn on numlock\nsudo sh -c 'setleds +num < /dev/console'\n\n# turn off numlock\nsudo sh -c 'setleds -num < /dev/console'\n\nIt's also possible to write to the /sys entry for the device:\n# Note that 'bash' is used to support the '?' glob.\n# You could use 'sh' if you specified \"input1.\"\n\n# Turn off numlock LED (also turns off the numlock state)\nsudo bash -c 'echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/input?::numlock/brightness'\n\n# Turn on numlock LED\nsudo bash -c 'echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/input?::numlock/brightness'\n\nFor the /sys approach, you don't need to spawn a sub-shell since tee can write to the brightness file without output redirection:\n# both the ? glob and > redirection happen outside the sudo process by your local shell\n\n# Turn on\necho 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/input?::numlock/brightness > /dev/null\n\n# Turn off\necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/input?::numlock/brightness > /dev/null\n\n\nTested on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B rev 1.4.\n\nA: You can use setleds.  See man setleds or setleds --help for more information.\nI believe that in the man page, there is an example of setting numlock on various terminals.

That way I could first upgrade to 14.10 and then to 15.04.\nThis is done using the do-release-upgrade -d command to go from 14.04 to 14.10 (the -d is required because the official version is obsolete so only the developer version is available for upgrade.)\nOnce 14.10 was upgraded, I could upgrade to 15.04 in the normal way, that is, using the do-release-upgrade without the -d option.\nSo if you are late upgrading from an LTS or other version to a newer version, you may need to use the -d to go to an intermediate version considered obsolete.\n", "Q: Are there any good podcast clients for Ubuntu and alternatives?

I have an nVidia graphics card and am using the nVidia driver (proprietary, tested).  I am using gdm as I don't light the look of lightdm (also, I have two monitors and it doesn't seem to work well with that set up).  After the first user logs in the unity desktop seems to work fine.  However, selecting using the icon in the far upper right of the screen to select another user to switch to does absolutely nothing.  This seems, the screen doesn't go black, no authentication window pops up.  Nothing at all happens.  Only one user can be logged in at a time using the display manager.  I have read about a host of seemingly related problems.  However, I haven't been able to understand how to get basic user switching working.  Seems like a strange problem for a linux system to have.  Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.\n\nA: It sounds like you have some bizare XDM behaviour.  Try logging out of your x session.  It should take you back to the DM.  Otherwise, as was suggested by A.B. remove any/all dm's you have (you may want to install something basic like xdm as a place holder while you remove what you really want).  As discussed purge rather than remove (removes config's as well as packages) then install again from fresh.  Personally, I'd try this:-\nsudo apt-get install xdm\nsudo apt-get purge lightdm\nsudo apt-get purge gdm\nsudo apt-get install gdm\nsudo apt-get purge xdm\n\nI believe the core approach to XDMs is using /etc/X11/default-display-manager.  Check the contents of that file, contains the full path to your chosen DM.  \nThat said, I personally use kdm and kde, so this is what happens on my pc:-\n# cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager\n/usr/bin/kdm\n\n", "Q: \"mount -a\" not called at startup? I've got a problem mounting an external hard drive at startup.\nThe short question\nShould mount -a launch during startup process ? and how can I check it does ?\nThe whole story\nrelated to this topic\nI've mounted my hard drive using the fstab file by adding the line:\n#device        mountpoint             fstype    options  dump   fsck\n\n/dev/sda2    /home/yourname/mydata    vfat    defaults    0    0\n\nIt mounts when I called mount -a but its not mounted at startup.\nI've played with the auto/noauto mount option. As expected, when using noauto, the mount -a doesn't mount my drive. So the default auto value should be good.\nthat's why it seems to me the mount -a call isn't run at startup...\nThe system is the nano-headless cubian X1 running on a cubieboard A10 (pretty much the same as a raspeberry pi)\nthanks for any advice.\nDifferent from this topic since my hard drive boot correctly manually the issue is only at startup.\n\nA: Anything with the default settings in fstab should be mounted automatically, so you may not have it pointing to the correct device (especially since the internal drive is usually sda, and external drives are usually sdb, sdc, etc.) Here's how I would set up an external drive to automatically mount at boot:\n1. Identify your device\nRun sudo fdisk -l to get a list of your connected drives. You should find one matching the size and partition settings of the drive you want to automatically mount. For instance, my 16gb flash drive looks like this:\n    Disk /dev/sdd: 14.9 GiB, 16007561216 bytes, 31264768 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos Disk identifier: 0x00000000\n\n    Device     Boot Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type\n/dev/sdd1           8192 31264767  31256576 14.9G  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n\nSince this is the only device on my system that's close to the correct size, my removable drive must be sdd, and it's primary partition must be sdd1. (Yours will likely be sdb or sdc; mine is such a high letter because I have a lot of drives in my computer.)\nYou can test to make sure that you have have the right device by running sudo mount /dev/device /mnt and then checking the /mnt folder to see if the contents of that partition is correct. (Be sure to replace \"device\" with your own block device. For example, sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt.) To unmount the device again, use sudo umount /dev/device.\n2. Find your device's UUID\nWe want to do this because block devices may change. For example, right now my 16gb drive is sdd, but if I add more drives to my computer it may show up as sde, or sdf. At this point, my fstab would be trying to mount the wrong drive! Unlike the block device identifier, the UUID is built into the partition and never changes (unless you reformat your drive.) This makes it a much more reliable way of mounting removable drives.\nTo find your devices UUID, simly use the blkid command:\nsudo blkid\n\nFor my drive, the line I'm looking for looks like this (I have replaced the actual UUID with Xs):\n\n/dev/sdd1: UUID=\"XXXX-XXXX\" TYPE=\"vfat\"\n\nNote that this tells me not only the UUID, but also the filesystem type (which we will need later.)\n3. Edit your fstab file\nThis is the trickiest step. First, open up /etc/fstab as root in your favorite text editor:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n(Note that if you're using the Mate desktop environment you should use pluma instead of gedit. KDE also has it's own text editor.)\nNow you'll want to add a line to the end of this file that will cause your drive to be automatically mounted at boot. (It's good form to add a descriptive line (starting with #) before your entry to let those who come after you know why this line was added.) In my case, it would look something like this (note that you WILL have to change this line to match the information gathered in the previous steps):\n#External hard drive    \nUUID=XXXX-XXXX /media/exdrive           vfat    defaults,user        0       0\n\nThe first section of the line is the UUID of the partition you want mounted. Use the UUID you got from running blkid.\nThe second section is what folder you want the partition mounted to. Be sure the folder actually exists! In my example, I could use sudo mkdir /media/exdrive to create the folder I want to use. It may be a good idea to put this folder outside your home folder so that other users can still access the drive. You can always make a link to it if you want it more accessible.\nThe third section defines the filesystem your partition should be mounted as. Use the output from blkid to find your filesystem type. The drive in my example has a fat32 filesystem, so I need to use vfat. Alternately, you may have ntfs, ext4, or some other type altogether.\nThe fourth section specifies the mount options. This gets complicated, so if you want to do more reading on the subject you can do so here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab#Options\nFor most people following this guide, defaults,user should work fine.\nThe last two sections (0 and 0 in our example) have to do with the backup utility dump, and if and in what order fsck will check the disk. Neither should be needed in our setup, so it is safe to leave both at 0.\n4.

Following command also fails (make a script to download this file later) :\nd-i preseed/late_command string echo \"wget http://url\"> /target/home/username/getscript.sh\n\nAnd this one (just did it as a test) is failing as well:\nd-i preseed/late_command string apt-get install -y htop\n\nAny ideas?\nThanks in advance!\nTim\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04 I had a similar problem and found out after investigation that wget was not installed, so I added it to the preseed template\nd-i pkgsel/include string ... wget\n\n\nA: My guess would be that the url you're trying to retrieve is getting redirected to https:// and at least one of the certs in the chain isn't trusted in the installation environment. The installation environment is different from the target environment; the installation environment is the temporary kernel and initrd you point to during boot, and the target environment is that kernel and file systems that actually get installed.\nAt the point at which the preseed/late_command is ran, the target environment is mounted at /mnt/target and to run commands there, you'll need to chroot into it via chroot /mnt/target. Once you've done that, all commands you run will effect the target environment, not the installation environment. Now the kicker is that debconf provides you with the in-target command which chroots to the target, runs the given command, then exits back to the installation environment. Thus:\nd-i preseed/late_command string apt-get install -y htop\n\ntries to install htop in the installation environment (not the \"Finished\" target environment), while:\nd-i preseed/late_command string in-target apt-get install -y htop\n\ntries to install htop in the finished target environment.\nSo now that we're installing to the right place, it might also be that the cert still isn't trusted, in which case you can either fix the trust issue with some more in-target commands, then do the wget or throw caution to the end and disable wget's trust checking with something like this:\nd-i preseed/late_command string in-target wget -O /tmp/post-install.sh \"https://foo.bar/postinstall.sh\" --no-check-certificate; in-target chmod +x /tmp/post-install.sh; in-target /bin/bash /tmp/post-install.sh;\n\n", "Q: How to cleanly swap alt and ctrl keys in xubuntu?

Maybe not the most elegant solution, but is quick and easy one.\nFirst you need to partition your disk as you see fit. You may find a lot of tutorials on Google (https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+partition+disk+in+linux).\nI'll assume that you made only one partition on your new disk and that system sees your new disk as 'sdb' device (for more on identifying disks, please see https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+identify+hard+disk+in+%2Fdev+linux). \nCreate a folder called 'new_disk\" in your samba share directory:\nmkdir /path/to/samba_share/new_disk\n\nThen edit your 'fstab' file (found in /etc/fstab):\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nand it might look similar to this:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n\nproc  /proc  proc  defaults  0  0\n# /dev/sda5\nUUID=be35a709-c787-4198-a903-d5fdc80ab2f8  /  ext4  relatime,errors=remount-ro  0  1\n# /dev/sda6\nUUID=cee15eca-5b2e-48ad-9735-eae5ac14bc90  none  swap  sw  0  0\n\n/dev/scd0  /media/cdrom0  udf,iso9660  user,noauto,exec,utf8  0  0\n\nAnd you need to add a mount point for your new hard disk. Add the following line to your /etc/fstab file:\n/dev/sdb1  /path/to/samba_share/new_disk  ext4  defaults 0  0\n\nSave the changes and mount the new disk manually (or reboot for automatic mount):\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /path/to/samba_share/new_disk\n\nMake sure there is a new line at the end of the fstab file.\nAdjust access rights to your new disk/folder as you see fit, and you should be ready to go.\n", "Q: How to build the Adobe Brackets editor?

If other cards work in the card reader, then there is likely no problem with the card reader.\nYou can try using Photorec (the file recovery software) to recover more photos from the card but in the case you describe it's unlikely to be useful, as it sounds like the operating system can see all the files in the directory, it's just that some are corrupted.\n", "Q: can I install ubuntu on windows 10 I have downloaded ubuntu iso on windows 10.\nI have tried double click on iso file but windows asks for application to use.\nhow do I start the iso? \nIs it secure to run ubuntu under windows 10? \n\nA: You can't \"install\" ubuntu on windows 10 because ubuntu is an operating system like windows.

I just finished changing the boot order for GRUB2. I have three operating systems installed on the computer. I have Windows 8.1, Ubuntu Linux 15.04 and Mint Linux 17.2. I followed Marve's answer here: How do I change the GRUB boot order?\nThe thing is, it failed at first! I was booted into Ubuntu at the time I made the changes. I used the name reference like GRUB_DEFAULT='Windows 8' instead of index number, and I only worked with /etc/default/grub file. I then issued updated-grub and rebooted. I had Windows somewhere in the middle of the boot menu, Ubuntu at bottom, and Mint at the top. When the delay time ran out at the boot menu screen, Mint booted up, and not Windows.\nThen I rebooted and booted back into Ubuntu to ensure my changes were still there in /etc/default/grub and they sure were. I also noticed I had a third grub~ file, along with my grub.bak backup file.\nI then booted into Mint and made the same changes there, and rebooted. Sure enough, it worked! So I now have Windows selected by default at the boot menu screen and it boots up when time runs out. This is what I wanted.\nBut what bothers me is why I had to do this in Mint? Why did it not work in Ubuntu? Is this because I installed Mint after I installed Ubuntu? That's the only explanation I can think of. Is GRUB2 installed to more than one location? I remember that I had chosen to install the bootloader to the MBR during both system installations. Maybe it has something to do with the configuration files alone, and not the actual bootloader program? What if I had mounted the /etc to a dedicated partition? Would that make them share the configuration files? How about the /boot then?\nThere is another thing that bothers me with this setup, and it's the constant changing of the boot order and background colors and layout of the boot menu options for GRUB2. This seems to happen when either one of the operating systems gets an upgrade, or some major update that somehow requires updating the boot menu options. How can I avoid this? If I set the boot menu screen background to be blue, how can I prevent it from changing to purple the next morning when Ubuntu gets a new major update or upgrade?\nIn the linked answer above, have a look at the \"troubleshooting\" section. Here's an excerpt.\n\nThe Grub Customizer settings may work only from within the latest\n  Linux/Ubuntu installation, the one that installed the Grub.\n\nIt looks like I may be onto something here. This might have to do with what I mentioned above. Is it not so? It sounds really silly that you would have to make changes only in the last installed Linux system. Be it that you use a GUI tool like GRUB Customizer or the command line tools and manual editing. Can someone more knowledgeable please shed some light on this issue?\n\nA: If you have multiple installs using grub2, only one of them can be in MBR and controls booting. That usually is the last install. And you may have issues if you installed both originally to MBR of same drive. Grub remembers where it installed and a major update of grub will reinstall it. Or either or both installs may be updating grub. I like to document how system is booting with Summary report:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Info\nOn one install you use least you can unselect all install choices. But make sure other is in MBR as default boot first. \nHow do I prevent one of my partitions messing with Lubuntu Grub entries?\n\nA: GRUB is designed to take over control of the initial stages of the boot process. This works fine on a single-boot system (Ubuntu only, say) or when dual-booting one GRUB-based OS (like Ubuntu) with Windows; but when you install two GRUB-based OSes (like Ubuntu and Mint), the two GRUBs will fight for control of the boot process.\nExperienced multi-booters often take one of three approaches to manage this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Give control to one distribution -- You can omit GRUB from one installation in order to give control to another. One way to do this is to tell the installer for the secondary distribution to not install GRUB. In the case of both Ubuntu and Mint, you can do this by booting the installer in its \"try before installing\" mode, launch a Terminal, and typing sudo ubiquity -b. The -b option tells the installer to omit GRUB. Once installed, this gets trickier. Personally, I've got a dummy grub-pc-3 package that contains nothing but a couple of empty directories. Its version number guarantees that it's \"more recent\" than any GRUB 2 pacakge, and so installing it causes GRUB to be removed and the system won't attempt to re-install GRUB (which may otherwise happen). This dummy-package approach is inelegant; I'm sure there's a better way to achieve the same effect, but I've never bothered researching it to figure out what it might be.\n\n*Give control to a custom GRUB 2 -- You can remove GRUB 2 from both your installations and then set up a GRUB 2 that's independent of either one. This can make the system as a whole more robust against problems caused by deleting the distribution associated with GRUB 2 in the future, so this method is favored by people who multi-boot many distributions and who make frequent changes to those distributions. It requires a lot of GRUB 2 expertise to set it up, though.\n\n*Abandon GRUB 2 in favor of something else -- This approach is like the preceding one, but instead of setting up a distribution-independent GRUB 2, you set up a distribution-independent non-GRUB boot loader. Under BIOS, possibilities include LILO, SYSLINUX, and GRUB Legacy. Under EFI, options include ELILO, SYSLINUX, rEFInd, and gummiboot/systemd-boot. All of these tools are easier to manually configure than GRUB 2, but most are harder than automatic GRUB 2 configuration (assuming automatic configuration works correctly -- as you've discovered, sometimes it doesn't!).\n\n\nAs with anything computer-related, understanding the tools and processes will help you control them. To that end, you should first figure out whether you're booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode or in EFI/UEFI mode. In Linux, this is easily done: Look for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've probably booted in BIOS mode. If your Windows 8.1 was pre-installed, it almost certainly boots in EFI mode. BIOS-mode and EFI-mode booting are very different, so you should be sure to read up on the appropriate boot mode. (BIOS-mode booting is older, so a lot of older documentation doesn't even mention BIOS-vs.-EFI issues and just assumes BIOS-mode booting. EFI-mode documentation is usually quite explicit that it's about booting in EFI mode.)\nFor EFI-mode booting, I recommend you read the following references:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog post on how EFI-mode booting. This page provides basic background on how EFI-mode booting works.\n\n*My own page on installing Linux to an EFI-based computer provides distribution-agnostic practical advice.\n\n*My page on EFI boot loaders for Linux describes EFI-mode boot loaders in more detail.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI covers installing Ubuntu on an EFI-based system.\n\n\nI don't happen to have specific recommendations for further reading on BIOS-mode booting handy.\n", "Q: Slow file transfer issue with usb storage Im using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS , the problem happens when i try to copy files from my HDD to Pendrive . Transmission slows down in the very last time and stuck for few minutes which is very annoying ! Can anyone help please ! its a pain ! note that my hdd's drives are formatted with ntfs partition .\n\nA: Linux kernel implements the strategy that all read-writes from/to external devices go though the RAM (buffer). \nSo sometimes it can be seen graphically that at first the contents are going very fast from disk to the external USB but its slowing down at the last moment, this happens when the contents are being transferred from buffer to the USB device. This solely depends on how speedy your USB are and also depends on disk speed at first while transferring from disk to buffer. Sometimes it can also happen that you don't have sufficient free buffer to carry out the operation smoothly.\nI would suggest you to look at iotop to get a better idea on this.

It's not in 15.10 yet at least.\nI patched libexfat/mount.c with the change in github, which changes the error to a warning.\nI.e. from (row 255, or so):\n    if (le64_to_cpu(ef->sb->sector_count) * SECTOR_SIZE(*ef->sb) >\n          exfat_get_size(ef->dev))\n    {\n        free(ef->zero_cluster);\n        exfat_error(\"file system is larger than underlying device: \"\n                \"%\"PRIu64\" > %\"PRIu64,\n                le64_to_cpu(ef->sb->sector_count) * SECTOR_SIZE(*ef->sb),\n                exfat_get_size(ef->dev));\n        exfat_close(ef->dev);\n        free(ef->sb);\n        return -EIO;\n    }\n\nto\n    if (le64_to_cpu(ef->sb->sector_count) * SECTOR_SIZE(*ef->sb) >\n            exfat_get_size(ef->dev))\n    {\n        /* this can cause I/O errors later but we don't fail mounting to let\n           user rescue data */\n        exfat_warn(\"file system is larger than underlying device: \"\n                \"%\"PRIu64\" > %\"PRIu64,\n                le64_to_cpu(ef->sb->sector_count) * SECTOR_SIZE(*ef->sb),\n                exfat_get_size(ef->dev));\n    }\n#endif\n\nIn order to get this do:\nsudo apt-get source exfat-fuse\ncd fuse-exfat-1.1.0/\n\nedit libexfat/mount.c as described above\nsudo apt-get build-dep exfat-fuse\ndpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b\nsudo dpkg -i ../exfat-fuse_1.1.0-2_amd64.deb\n\nAnd you're done and can mount the SD-card as expected.\nGood luck!\n\nA: An alternative is to compile and install the latest version of exFAT.

However, on your hardware, the HDMI port is driven by the nVidia card and the Intel drives the VGA port.\nYou can test this by running sudo lshw on your system as it is and then enabling the nVidia card again and running another sudo lshw and presto: an HDMI port shows up!\n", "Q: Restore EFI from Windows after Windows 10 upgade broke boot list? I updated to Windows 10 late July, and it deleted all of the boot entries on my computer. I was able to find the correct Windows boot efi file, and added the option to boot, but I could not find the ubuntu efi file. I can access files through windows, but I want to get back to using Ubuntu. What boot entry should I look for? If it isn't there, could I download the EFI file and add it to the correct place?\n\nA: Assuming that your Ubuntu installation is intact (not a safe assumption), you should be able to get up and running again as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a medium from the downloaded files.\n\n*If necessary, disable Secure Boot. (There are ways to do this with Secure Boot active, but they require adding more steps.)\n\n*Boot to the rEFInd medium. It should present you with options to boot both Windows and Ubuntu.\n\n*Highlight an Ubuntu option and hit the Enter key to launch it. (Caveat: If you have a separate /boot partition, you'll have to hit F2 or Insert twice, rather than Enter. This will open up a text editor in which you must add a root={something} option, where {something} is your root [/] filesystem, such as /dev/mapper/ubuntu or /dev/sda6.)\n\n*Once Ubuntu appears, you can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-install GRUB, probably by typing sudo grub-install at a command prompt.\n\n*Install rEFInd to the hard disk by installing the Debian package or PPA, as described in the rEFInd documentation.\n\n\n*If you disabled Secure Boot, you should be able to re-enable it at this point, although you might need to jump through some extra hoops if you replace GRUB with rEFInd, as described in the rEFInd Secure Boot documentation.\nIf you go through this process and install GRUB at the very end, the result should be very similar to using Boot Repair; it's just that the steps to get there are different. Either way, if Windows has deleted your grubx64.efi file (and related files on the ESP), then those file(s) must be restored.\nGetting back to the first word of this answer, though, checking the current state of the Ubuntu installation may be in order. To be sure, the procedure I've just outlined will fail miserably at step #4 if Ubuntu is missing -- rEFInd will show no Ubuntu entries (or possibly a GRUB entry that will ultimately fail). Furthermore, it's possible that everything remains installed, but your boot order has simply changed. You might think that GRUB has been deleted if you're looking on the wrong partition. Ubuntu sometimes installs GRUB to one partition even though Windows uses another one for its boot loader, so such confusion can occur pretty easily. In this scenario, it would be more efficient (but not necessarily more effective) to use efibootmgr in Linux to adjust the boot order. For all of these reasons, running the Boot Info Script and pasting a link to the RESULTS.txt file that it generates (posted on a pastebin site) may be worthwhile.\n\nA: I had a similar problem like you and I solved it using EasyUEFI which apparently is free for home use (on non-enterprise Windows editions). After installing and opening it just do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take the left choice \"Manage EFI Boot Option\",\n\n*Click the button with the tooltip \"Create New Entry\" (center button row, 2nd from top).\n\n*Now enter or enter the file path of Shim: \"\\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\" (or if Secure Boot is not active then you can alternatively also have it point to Grub directly), add a description like \"Ubuntu\" or similar and confirm by clicking OK.\n\n*Move the just created entry to the top (top button again in the center row).\n\n\nThat's it, it should automatically boot you into Grub again. No booting from flash drive or similar needed.\nAlternatively, if the Grub/Shim entry is still there, just not the first one in the boot order\n\n\n*\n\n*In an elevated prompt do:\nbcdedit /enum all\n\n\n*In its output look for the ID of your boot loader entry. It's similar to:\nFirmware Application (101fffff)\n-------------------------------\nidentifier              {8b455a95-4c31-11e6-9f4c-8066cf6e9636}\ndevice                  partition=\\Device\\HarddiskVolume2\npath                    \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\ndescription             Ubuntu\n\n\n*Set it to be first which the attempts to boot:\nbcdedit /bootsequence <ID OF YOUR BOOT LOADER ENTRY>\n\n", "Q: Matlab crashes on start after upgrading to 15.04 (from 14.10) [works as sudo] I recently upgraded to 15.04 and immediately after, Matlab 2012b no longer worked and crashed either as soon as it loads the program, or a few moments after I try to do anything.

If you want to download the source packages for Nautilus, use apt-get source nautilus.\nIf a Stable Release Update or a Security Update introduces a new version of the software (e.g. a new version of Firefox), you'll have to look upstream for the full delta.\nNot all package sources are available under version control (git, hg, bzr, ...).\n\n*Discussion generally happen on Launchpad. If necessary, the ubuntu-devel mailing list may be used too.\n\n*People responsible for updates are the people who provide the updates (package maintainers or contributors), the Ubuntu SRU Team and the Ubuntu Security Team.\nNote that not all of these people are Canonical employees. Be kind and don't forget those contributors who use their spare time to maintain stability and security in Ubuntu :-)\n\n*The process for Stable Release Updates and Security Updates is documented on the Ubuntu Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures\n\nA: Regarding linux kernel, you can look into the kernel git and see all commits.\nRegarding other packages, in most cases there is a launchpad bug link in changelog.\nYou can see the history of updates in /var/log/apt/history.log\nFor each package you can get a changelog by\napt-get changelog <package_name>\n\nYou can follow that link and see the history of that bug.\nRegarding packages provided by 3rd parties, like Google Chrome and PPAs, there is no specific way to get this information. It can be available or not. It depends on 3rd parties.\nGoogle Chrome is provided by Google and Ubuntu community is not involved. You can ask at Google support sites if this information is available. I am not sure that it is.\nYou can see how SRU works at Ubuntu wiki\n", "Q: what is the best number of segment per download for xdman? I have terrible internat connection (about 15KB/sec --while download),the xdman package allows the user to select the number of segment per download.\nis this setting depends on the quality of connection(faster or slower)\n\nA: wget --continue will download the file in multiple tries, if necessary. No need to \"segment\". sudo apt-get install wget; man wget. Then, you would do:  \nwget --<wget options> --continue https://somesite.example.org/reallybigfile\n\nRepeat until done. The first time, --continue is ignored, and wget starts downloading. Network connection drops, wget times out. The second (and subsequent) tries, --continue tells wget to resume downloading the file where it left off. Eventually, the download will complete, and the whole file will be there.\n\nA: The optimal segment size is either 4 or 8\nTry with both4 and 8 segment and compare the speed\n", "Q: No updates for 14.10 When I look at\n$ cat /etc/lsb-release \nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.10\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=utopic\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.10\"\n\nBut my /etc/apt/sources.list is already all vivid (15.04).\nRunning do-release-upgrade does start the process but says there are 0 packages to be upgraded.\nHow do I fully update my system to vivid?\n\nA: I looked at \napt-cache policy base-files\n\nthere I found out, that I pinned something.\nI had a file\n/etc/apt/preferences.d/vivid-manual-only \n\nwhich sticks the vivid upgrade to manal upgrade only:\nPackage: *\nPin: release n=vivid\nPin-Priority: 99\n\nRemove that file and your updates are found by\ndo-release-upgrade\n\n", "Q: Mathbuntu flavor installation I downloaded the installation script from mathbuntu.org.

Before marking this as duplicate, please hear me out. I have read countless posts on this issue, but none have been able to help me. I am having an issue with the WiFi that I didn't have with Windows 10, my previous OS. This issue started since installing Ubuntu when I was trying to install updates. The Internet on my laptop goes out randomly, but all other computers are fine so it can't be my router. Sometimes it stops working after a minute after reboot and sometimes an hour. It's random as to when it will stop working and once it's gone, it doesn't come back unless I reboot. I have 2 Windows 10 machines and another Ubuntu 14.04 machine that my brother runs that is fine. The Internet issue I am facing resolves upon reboot, but it occurs again randomly when I'm browsing and is not fixed by enabling/disabling WiFi or disconnecting/reconnecting. I have to restart the computer to fix the wifi. I ran the command dmesg before the Internet could go out again and got the result. I am unable to post it on here since there's a character limit, but I have the result in a text file. I have also tried to change my ipv6 settings to Link-Local Only, but that didn't resolve the issue. Also, the WiFi icon says that my Internet is fine, but it isn't. Pinging in the terminal also does not work when the Internet is gone, even though the WiFi icon is still active.\nAfter the Internet went out, I ran the command lcpci -v and got:\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT DRAM Controller (rev 0b)\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device 3978\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 0b) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device 380c\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 47\n    Memory at c0000000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4M]\n    Memory at b0000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]\n    I/O ports at 5000 [size=64]\n    Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: i915\n\n00:03.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT HD Audio Controller (rev 0b)\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device 3978\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 48\n    Memory at c0610000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: snd_hda_intel\n\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP USB xHCI HC (rev 04) (prog-if 30 [XHCI])\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device 3978\n    Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 42\n    Memory at c0600000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: xhci_hcd\n\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP HECI #0 (rev 04)\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device 3978\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 45\n    Memory at c0618000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=32]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: mei_me\n\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP HD Audio Controller (rev 04)\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device 3978\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 46\n    Memory at c0614000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: snd_hda_intel\n\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP PCI Express Root Port 3 (rev e4) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0\n    Bus: primary=00, secondary=01, subordinate=01, sec-latency=0\n    I/O behind bridge: 00004000-00004fff\n    Memory behind bridge: c0500000-c05fffff\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: pcieport\n\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP PCI Express Root Port 4 (rev e4) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0\n    Bus: primary=00, secondary=02, subordinate=02, sec-latency=0\n    I/O behind bridge: 00003000-00003fff\n    Memory behind bridge: c0400000-c04fffff\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: pcieport\n\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP USB EHCI #1 (rev 04) (prog-if 20 [EHCI])\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device 3978\n    Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 23\n    Memory at c061c000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1K]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: ehci-pci\n\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP LPC Controller (rev 04)\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device 3978\n    Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: lpc_ich\n\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP SATA Controller 1 [AHCI mode] (rev 04) (prog-if 01 [AHCI 1.0])\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device 3978\n    Flags: bus master, 66MHz, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 43\n    I/O ports at 5088 [size=8]\n    I/O ports at 5094 [size=4]\n    I/O ports at 5080 [size=8]\n    I/O ports at 5090 [size=4]\n    I/O ports at 5060 [size=32]\n    Memory at c061b000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=2K]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: ahci\n\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP SMBus Controller (rev 04)\n    Subsystem: Lenovo Device 3978\n    Flags: medium devsel\n    Memory at c0619000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]\n    I/O ports at 5040 [size=32]\n\n01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

According to my searches on this issue, for some odd reason, majority of the machines having this problem are by Lenovo. I'm not sure if this issue is a result of hardware conflicts or what, but I \"fixed\" the issue by installing a fresh copy of 15.04 and it is working perfectly. \nThe machine started off at Windows 8 and was perfect for 8.1 and 10. When I installed a fresh copy of 14.04, I experienced the issue I detailed above. I experienced the same issue at 14.10. When I reinstalled a fresh copy of Windows 8.1, the laptop functioned perfectly. When I tried 14.04 again, same issue. This leads me to believe that there is some sort of problem with what's being supported in 14.04. When I fresh installed 15.04, everything ran perfectly.\nSo if you're having this issue and you absolutely cannot figure out how to fix this problem, I recommend trying out 15.04. Yes, it's not a solution to the problem since I, myself, wanted 14.04 LTS, but at least with this method, your laptop isn't useless. \nFor now, I will mark this as the best answer.\n", "Q: how do I configure preseed to populate the hostname from DHCP and not stop at the `configure the network` section during an unattended installation? I'm trying to setup an unattended Ubuntu server install using preseed for my Hadoop cluster nodes.\nThe hostnames are associated with MAC addresses by using a static map on my router. During installation, the hostname is pre-populated with the name from the static map, e.g.\n\nUnfortunately, the installation pauses at this point and it's necessary to manually tab to 'continue'.\nThe netcfg settings currently look like this:\nd-i netcfg/choose_interface select em1\nd-i netcfg/dhcp_timeout string 60\nd-i netcfg/disable_dhcp boolean false\nd-i netcfg/dhcp_failed note\nd-i netcfg/get_hostname string unassigned-hostname\nd-i netcfg/get_domain string unassigned-domain\nd-i netcfg/get_hostname seen true\nd-i netcfg/get_domain seen true\n\nCan you see what needs to be changed/added in order for the hostname to be set from the DHCP static map without stopping at 'configure the network'?\n\nA: When netbooting, certain things get setup before the preseed gets retrieved and read, including networking. If its not setup on the command line, the installer will make a guess and ask you to confirm, which is what you're seeing. katu txakurra is correct that the hostname and domain you specify in the preseed and on the command line will be overridden by the values from DHCP, so add something like the following to your kernel arguments:\nhostname=unassigned-hostname domain=unassigned-domain\n\nSince you said \"unattended\" I assume you're already set priority=critical on the command line to ensure that only critical questions are asked, but if not, set that too to reduce the number of things you need to preseed\n\nA: Replace the lines\nd-i netcfg/get_hostname seen true\nd-i netcfg/get_domain seen true\n\nfor this\nd-i netcfg/get_hostname string ahostname\nd-i netcfg/get_domain string adomain\n\nAny hostname and domain names assigned from DHCP will take precedence over these values but setting them here will stop the question.\n", "Q: wrong reference to home user shortcuts in 'unity launcher in my unity launcher the default Files icon points to the correct home directory;\nbut if I try to reach the standard folders (Desktop/ Downloads/ etc. -) through the right-click shortcut it points to a non (more) existing user ;\nhow can I update the reference to correct user in launcher?\n\nA: Is the path correct when you scroll over the library on the right side from nautilus? fix those by dragging the correct library to the right hand pane and then remove the incorrect one from there. \n", "Q: 64 Bit Ubuntu onyl recognizeds 3.5 GB of 6 GB RAM I had 4 GB of RAM only 3.5 was usable, I enabled pae when I installed antoehr 2 GB and it yet only came up with 3.5 GB and now I've wiped my hard drive and installed 64 Bit Ubuntu and its yet only recognizing 3.4 GB of my ram actually  I run a dedicated graphics and have tried cleaning  and swapping the slots my ram was in \n  PCI (sysfs)  \n  *-firmware              \n       description: BIOS\n       vendor: Dell Inc.\n       physical id: 0\n       version: A11\n       date: 11/30/2006\n       size: 64KiB\n       capacity: 448KiB\n       capabilities: pci pnp apm upgrade shadowing cdboot bootselect edd int13floppytoshiba int5printscreen int9keyboard int14serial int17printer acpi usb ls120boot biosbootspecification netboot\n  *-cache:0\n       description: L1 cache\n       physical id: 700\n       size: 16KiB\n       capacity: 16KiB\n       capabilities: internal write-back data\n  *-cache:1\n       description: L2 cache\n       physical id: 701\n       size: 4MiB\n       capacity: 4MiB\n       capabilities: internal varies unified\n  *-memory\n       description: System Memory\n       physical id: 1000\n       slot: System board or motherboard\n       size: 6GiB\n     *-bank:0\n          description: DIMM DDR Synchronous 533 MHz (1.9 ns)\n          product: 6400EL Series\n          vendor: 7F7F7F7F7F020000\n          physical id: 0\n          serial: 00000000\n          slot: DIMM_1\n          size: 2GiB\n          width: 64 bits\n          clock: 533MHz (1.9ns)\n     *-bank:1\n          description: DIMM DDR Synchronous 533 MHz (1.9 ns)\n          product: KC6844-ELG37\n          vendor: Kingston\n          physical id: 1\n          serial: B01EBFEE\n          slot: DIMM_3\n          size: 1GiB\n          width: 64 bits\n          clock: 533MHz (1.9ns)\n     *-bank:2\n          description: DIMM DDR Synchronous 533 MHz (1.9 ns)\n          product: 6400EL Series\n          vendor: 7F7F7F7F7F020000\n          physical id: 2\n          serial: 00000000\n          slot: DIMM_2\n          size: 2GiB\n          width: 64 bits\n          clock: 533MHz (1.9ns)\n     *-bank:3\n          description: DIMM DDR Synchronous 533 MHz (1.9 ns)\n          product: KC6844-ELG37\n          vendor: Kingston\n          physical id: 3\n          serial: B01EC9EE\n          slot: DIMM_4\n          size: 1GiB\n          width: 64 bits\n          clock: 533MHz (1.9ns)\n\n\nA: You cannot run unequal quantities or different speeds or different voltages or basically any 2 RAMS that are not the same model and size without running into a problem. \nthis is because the computer can only assign equal sizes of RAM for a task so if a task requires 3GB of RAM (theoretically) then there would be a fatal error.\nSo there is no hardware support for this. Same problem with different speeds\nDifferent manufacturers also cause a problem because of incompatibility. So you cannot have 6GB of RAM especially if they run at different clock speeds. you can have 2GB, 4GB, 8GB and so on, with equal sizes of RAM \nEDIT: saw your quantities later but same theory applies, you cannot divide \"channels\" into unequal quantities causing fatal errors (hence no hardware support). BTW get RAM with higher frequency for a performance upgrade, a lot of the power lies in the clock speed and 500mhz is extremely low when there are 3000mhz sticks available now! \nCheck overclockers.com and tomshardware.com (many more) for more info about this.\nBasically problem isn't in ubuntu so this is the wrong forum to ask this question. Even at those forums you'll get an answer like \"it won't work for you (most probably) but if it does then don't run it cause it'll cause more damage than it'll do good\"\n", "Q: Use existing encrypted directory as home directory In the past, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 with /dev/sda4 mounted as /home. I encrypted my home directory.\nToday, I erased all the partitions except /dev/sda4 and I installed Xubuntu 14.04 on a new partition (/dev/sda3). I did not mount /dev/sda4.\nThen I used usermod to change my home directory from /home/jordan to /home-old/jordan. Then I mounted /dev/sda4 as /home.\nNow I want to change my current home directory from /home-old/jordan to /home/jordan, keeping the original (encrypted) contents of /home/jordan.\nHow can I do this? (I know both the login password and the ecryptfs passphrase used to encrypt the old home directory.)\n\nA: I'm not an expert in ecryptfs, but it looks to me like it should just work, if your password on the new system is the same as on the old system.  Have you tried it?\nIf the passwords are not the same, you may need to rewrite /home/.ecryptfs/jordan/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase but be sure to save a copy first!  You can create a new wrapped passphrase with\necryptfs-wrap-passphrase /home/.ecryptfs/jordan/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\nIt will ask two questions.  First enter your ecryptfs passphrase (32-character hexadecimal string), then enter your new password.  Of course this is after backing up the existing wrapped-passphrase file).\nAgain, I am not an expert and I have not tried this, so proceed at your own risk and discretion.  The posting guidelines request I not post this opinion; however, I consider it an informed opinion, and no one else has answered.\n", "Q: Radeon Driver Help!

I should basically be able to run said command/script out-of-the-box on a system that lacks awk, sed, perl, ruby, and python, and runs bash-4.1 as its shell.\nIf that isn't possible, then I would at least prefer the script/command use/be ubiquitous, like vi, cat, ls, etc.\nThe bare minimum of my requirements is that the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*can delete a file and all of its symlinks with only the original file as an argument\n\n*can do so without knowing the names or locations of said symlinks\n\n*can do so on symlinks of varying names and varying locations\n\n*works in a fresh, minimal install of Arch Linux (or similar minimal system)\n\n*is not a code-golf\n\n*regexes reasonable and easy-to-understand\n\n\nThis is how I try to design my own scripts, so I consider it reasonable. But I nonetheless hope it isn't too demanding.\nThanks.\n\nEdit: I feel like I'm obligated to show my work. Just requesting a script makes me feel like a jerk. So, this is what I have:\nget_lnk(){\n    gl_file=\"$1\"\n    gl_orig_a=( $(ls -l \"$gl_file\") )\n    gl_orig=\"${gl_orig_a[-1]}\"\n}\nfor i in *; do \n    get_lnk \"$i\"\n    echo \"file: $gl_file\"\n    echo \"links to: $gl_orig\"\n    echo\ndone\n\n# output:\n\nfile: file-l\nlinks to: ../file\n\nfile: file-l2\nlinks to: ../file\n\nThis prints the name of the symlink and the name of the file it points to. This is actually the opposite of what I'm trying to do, but is reasonably useful (when all the links are in the same place).\n\nA: Let's say you have a file named file1 in ~/tmp, and let's say that you want to recursively remove all the symlinks to file1 in ~/tmp;\nUsing find:\nfind ~/tmp -lname ~/tmp/file1 -exec rm {} +\n\n\n\n*\n\n*~/tmp: specifies the path to the directory hierarchy in which to search;\n\n*-lname: searches only for symlinks linking to ~/tmp/file1;\n\n*-exec rm {} +: removes all the results;\n\n\nSample output on a test directory hierarchy:\nuser@debian ~/tmp % tree\n.\n├── 1\n│   ├── 2\n│   │   ├── 3\n│   │   │   ├── link3-1 -> /home/user/tmp/file1\n│   │   │   └── link3-2 -> /home/user/tmp/file2\n│   │   ├── link2-1 -> /home/user/tmp/file1\n│   │   └── link2-2 -> /home/user/tmp/file2\n│   ├── link1-1 -> /home/user/tmp/file1\n│   └── link1-2 -> /home/user/tmp/file2\n├── file1\n└── file2\n\n3 directories, 8 files\nuser@debian ~/tmp % find . -lname ~/tmp/file1 -exec rm {} +\nuser@debian ~/tmp % tree\n.\n├── 1\n│   ├── 2\n│   │   ├── 3\n│   │   │   └── link3-2 -> /home/user/tmp/file2\n│   │   └── link2-2 -> /home/user/tmp/file2\n│   └── link1-2 -> /home/user/tmp/file2\n├── file1\n└── file2\n\n3 directories, 5 files\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu failed to log in to UI I have a Ubuntu running on a virtual box.

I don't know if this is best practice or not, but I basically kept trying to run sudo apt-get remove codeblocks to get an error code and see which components of codeblocks were installed and had dependency errors. I then used sudo dpkg -r --force-depends <package name> where I replaced  with whatever package that seemed to be causing an issue. I ended up having to do this to codeblocks-dev, codeblocks-contrib, and codeblocks-dbg which was from the first set of error codes I have. \nAgain, I'm not sure if this is the proper way to do this, but after doing this, I was then able to install non-codeblocks packages again, which works for me.\n", "Q: limitation of capacity of syslog file I would like to decrease the storage usage of syslog because the free space of the root partition is small.\nStorage usage of syslog are shown below.\n-rw-r-----  1 syslog            adm      42G  Aug 31 14:56 syslog\n-rw-r-----  1 syslog            adm     3.6G  Aug 31 11:55 syslog.1\n-rw-r-----  1 syslog            adm     512M  Aug 30 18:24 syslog.2.gz\n-rw-r-----  1 syslog            adm      34K  Aug 28 07:44 syslog.4.gz\n-rw-r-----  1 syslog            adm      52K  Aug 27 08:31 syslog.5.gz\n-rw-r-----  1 syslog            adm      47K  Aug 26 08:47 syslog.6.gz\n\nTo decrease the storage usage (under 1000MB) of syslog, \\etc\\logrotate.conf was edited as shown below.

I am trying to keep one my systems up-to-date. The intended target is Not Connected to the internet. Am trying to get all the needed info from another machine with internet access.\nAfter a bit of study, I found a way to achieve this. Can you please tell me if this is correct & safe?\n\nHere is my understanding of the apt-get process..\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*First, we run the command 'apt-get update' : This connects to all the repositories mentioned in the '/etc/apt/sources.list'.. And,\n  downloads all the Packages.gz files like\n  (in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz)\n  & saves them in a similar name under '/var/lib/apt/lists' (for the\n  above mentioned url the corresponding file is\n  in.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_trusty_main_binary-amd64_Packages)\n  \n*Then, when we run 'apt-get upgrade' (or) 'apt-get install pkg_name', this checks the locally installed package list with the local meta-data\n  downloaded & stored at '/var/lib/apt/lists'. And, then gets the\n  download url from that & asks for user confirmation before downloading\n  & installing the required packages.\n  \n\nThis is my plan to keep the isolated machine up-to-date..\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the list of packages to download from the /etc/apt/sources.list conf file at the target machine.. \n\n*Download the meta-data files Packages.gz at another machine..\n\n*Copy these files to target machine's /var/lib/apt/lists under appropriate filename.\n\n*Run the apt-get --print-uris upgrade (or) apt-get --print-uris --yes install pkg_name to get the list of all the packages needed for that machine.\n\n*Download these packages again at the second machine.\n\n*Copy them to the target machine.\n\n*Run the dpkg -i pkg_list to install all the missing packages.\n\n\nI am able to achieve my goal using this process.\nMy question is : Is this correct & reliable? Or is there an easier way to achieve this?\n\nA: This should work in theory, but I have two ideas regarding that:\nCopy the downloaded debs to /var/cache/apt/archives/ instead of installing them with dpkg -i. Thats where apt checks for packages and downloads them to.\nAnd probably even better: Check out apt-zip:\n\nAPT-ZIP is a package to update a non-networked computer using apt and a (removable) media (harddisk, USB key, ZIP drive...)\nThe apt-zip-list and apt-zip-inst commands simplify the upgrade process of a non-networked Debian host using apt , by using (preferably high-capacity) removable media, like a ZIP or USB drive.\napt-zip-list produces two files. One is a `fetch´script (supporting wget backends, in a modular, extensible way) that can be used on another host (maybe not running a Debian system with good connectivity to the Internet) to fetch packages previously selected in dselect(8) or indicated in the command line and then install the packages on your Debian box; the other apt-zip.options saves the options used by apt-zip-list to indicates to apt-zip-inst what action to perform and/or which packages to install.\n\n\nA: Short answer is No. \nWhat you are saying is an Ubuntu running without internet which in itself is pretty bad because you don't get OTA Updates for your version and your bugs will not get removed and neither will repository support be available.\nThis is not recommended for Ubuntu as it will have you running on a flavor that is not supported by the community. I only mention this because many smaller (not less important updates) are not available in the lists folder so will not be installed on your system.\nAs for actually doing it you could change the sources file at /etc/apt/sources.list to point to a location in your system.\nHowever, like i said this is not going to help you cause what you are doing is trying to update your Ubuntu which would technically not be happening. But you could still Partially update Ubuntu using what i said above. \nAs for whether there is a better way to do this: not without a network connection, i don' mean an internet connection but a \"network connection' that is, 2 of your computers connected with a LAN cable so here you could point the sources.list file to the network address of your connected computer which then points any incoming connections to the correct server (basically mirroring) but here too you need an internet connection on the second computer so.... for your situation still nothing.\n", "Q: Strange Black Square at the Top-Left Side of the Screen in Xubuntu 14.04.3 A strange black square appears at the top-left side of the screen.

Why do we need three? I understand the need to have a generic one (python) and the need to have another one to distinguish python3 from python2 but the rest I do not know.\nFurthermore, how can I see if they are linked to the same file (symbolic link)?\n\nA: python is the default interpreter used by the distribution. It may (or may not1) point to python3 in the future. \npython2 is the default Python 2 interpreter (that is the same as above if python points to python2, not otherwise). It points to the current stable/supported interpreter.\npython2.7 is the specific interpreter --- you can have for example python2.7 as the current one, and a python2.1 that you need to check compatibility matters. \nTo see all of them:\n[romano:~] % ls -l /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python2.7\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       9 jul 22  2014 /usr/bin/python -> python2.7\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       9 jul 22  2014 /usr/bin/python2 -> python2.7\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3345416 jun 22 20:51 /usr/bin/python2.7\n\nSo in your scripts  — in the shebang2 — you use python if you want to use the default interpreter for the distribution (and if you want total future safety you have your script both working in version 2 and 3, but see note 1 below);   python2 or python3 if you need version 2 or 3 specifically, but it's ok using the default one the distribution offers (recommended); python2.7 if you need that specific version and you prefer that your script fails if it's not available. \n\n1 I think it will never change to point to python3, it's too dangerous.

Moreover, the network-manager program needs root access as its goal is to allow regular user access to the network (which is restricted to root user in most Unix systems).\nAs for your problem, you need to find out where the problem come from. You can try to have a look in the logs (/var/log/messages or /var/log/messages.log on Ubuntu 12.04). Another option is to launch the application and see the error message, by running directly network-manager daemon from your shell:\nsudo /usr/bin/NetworkManager --no-daemon\n\nAlso, did you remove the ubuntu network-manager package before installing from source?

Like if the rfkill block wlan is called seconds after rc.local.\n\nA: \nYour wifi might be disable for several reasons. I suggest you look into the logs (journalctl -b -0 if you use a recent version of Ubuntu).\nThis might be a problem with your network-manager configuration (assuming you use network-manager to access Internet, which is the default in Ubuntu), which can be found in the folder /var/lib/NetworkManager/.\nEDIT:\nIt can also be a problem with your kernel driver. I found that on this site: Cannot change soft block setting to \"no\" for AR9287 Wireless Network.\n", "Q: issue with dhcp default network file I'm installing dhcp server on Firewall and under that firewall i setup two clients who ll get dynamic ip addresses.\nI give static ip address to eth1 port on which i'm installing dhcp server on firewall. I disable firewall. The problem is that, after installing the dhcp server \" sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server\". and when i open \"sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server\" file there is nothing in it. Don't know why file is blank. \n\nA: I'm having trouble understanding your question. But I guess you have a problem with an empty file, /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server. This file isn't necessary to run the dhcp server, for example on my dhcp server there is content in this file, but it is all commented out and it works fine. Since you haven't configured anything, I would try to reinstall (sudo apt-get install --reinstall isc-dhcp-server) the dhcp server just in case.\nBut since this should be a non issue in default configs, maybe you simply want to configure your dhcp server? That is done in the file /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf. There you can set up network ranges, static ips over dhcp for your clients and well, anything that needs to be set in the dhcp server. There are a few examples here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/isc-dhcp-server\n", "Q: Ubuntu: Fail to open NTFS drives I some times encounter an error when I try to open an NTFS partitionof my hard disk on Ubuntu Operating System.\n\nI have installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1.\n\nUpdate: \nwhen I shut down windows, turn on Ubuntu and try to open disk it produces an error.\nbut \nthen I restart my computer. turn on again Windows then restart Windows. and this time if I turn on Ubuntu and open Drives. they easily open, without showing error.\n\nA: Go to power management settings on Windows and turn off fast start-up \nThat should do the trick for you \nWindows basically keeps the drives in a suspended state and to prevent data loss Ubuntu cannot mount it with rw permissions. \n", "Q: Is Ubuntu spyware (referring to article by Richard Stallmann)? I received a link to the article \"Ubuntu Spyware: What to do?\" by Richard Stallmann which advises the reader not to use or recommend Ubuntu for several reasons:\n\n*\n\n*It does not meet all four freedoms of free software.\n\n*Canonical encourages the use of non-free software\n\n*Ubuntu is spyware as e.g. the dash search queries are also sent to Canonical and Amazon to include further online results and ads!\nThey say that since 12.04 the local dash search automatically also performs an online search at Amazon. The feature might be turned off in the System Settings and all queries are anonymized by Canonical and routed through their servers, but that means that at least they know what we search. (Reference)\nAdditional to these accusations, I've also heard that e.g. the automatic bug reports may include more personal data than needed.\nMy question:\nMay please someone with deep knowledge of the mentioned parts of Ubuntu, it's security and privacy options and/or Canonical's policy on this comment on those statements and verify them? How much is true, what is wrong or exaggerated, how can the normal user avoid being spied on by either Canonical or any third-party companies like Amazon? Do the latest versions of Ubuntu still have the automatic network search and other critical features enabled by default or did/will they improve this recently/soon?\nThank you for confirming my trust in Ubuntu or opening my eyes about it - whatever is necessary.\nNote: Please don't just write something you've read anywhere if you're not sure. An answer based on prejudices or what's believed by \"normal\"/non-expert users are not very helpful in this case.\n\nA: I will address your 3 main points one at a time:\n\n\n*\n\n*It does meet the four freedoms of free software.  You can run whatever your want (provided that it's within the law), you can get the source code and tweak it and redistro it.\n\n*Just because Canonical encourages the use of non-free software doesn't discredit them.  That's like saying \"Because Microsoft encourages you to use non-free software (like Office)\" or \"Because Apple encourages you to purchase iLife.\"  It's just not a valid reason to discredit them.\n\n*Yes the queries are sent back for processing, but so are Google searches, yet nobody's boycotting Google for that.  Just because software send queries for server-side processing doesn't mean that they keep a record of that and use it or sell it.  And any solicitations that they give you in those searches can be disabled (I believe they are by default).  In the Ubuntu Software Center, you must explicitly enable software recommendations.\nSo this is not to say that you are 100% under the radar, but my point is that Ubuntu is at least as privacy-respecting as any other product.  If you really are concerned about being tracked by someone, maybe you should consider not being worth being tracked!\n", "Q: /tmp folders keep popping up on ubuntu desktop?

I have been trying all day to upgrade my version of libfuse-dev 2.9.2 to libfuse 2.9.4. I am on Ubuntu Server 14.04 (headless) But it seems that it has a TON of dependencies which need to be upgraded first. Libfuse sent me to libfuse2 to update to 2.9.4, then to libc6 etc... I can't upgrade anything without needing to upgrade another dependency. This is getting annoying, and I need to get libfuse-dev to 2.9.4. I have tried forcing installs, installing dependencies one by one, using gdebi, but nothing works. I need help. Please.\nThanks\n\nA: First, since you are on server, not desktop you need to install all the major packages needed by typing on terminal\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nthat should install needed packages up to libc6-dev. If it doesn't work, try\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libc6-dev\n\nI also recommend you to remove your current version by typing\nsudo apt-get remove libfuse-dev\n\nSecond, go to packages.ubuntu.com/it/wily/libfuse-dev (or any other you find)\nit has libfuse-dev 2.9.4-1 - then download libfuse2, libpcre3, libpcrecpp0, libpcre3-dev, libselinux1, libsepol1, libsepol1-dev ,libselinux1-dev (install these respectively in their order)\nThird open terminal then change directory to where you downloaded them \ne.g cd /home/ubuntu/download\nFourth, to install type in terminal, for example,\nsudo dpkg -i libfuse2_2.9.4-1ubuntu1_i386.deb\n\nthen proceed to installing the others. Dont forget to install them in the above order, libfuse2 then libpcre3...\nFifth, finally install libfuse-dev 2.9.4-1 you downloaded first\nAnd that should do it\n", "Q: Errors upgrading the linux kernel on Ubuntu 15.04 I've had to upgrade the kernel on Ubuntu 15.04 to get better drivers for my laptop (xps 13 9343).

Instead of generating 3 different awk scripts, you can read items from the input file with numbers into array first. Then, read whatever file you need to process and substitute particular item from array.\nFor instance, here's a code where I give two files , numbers first and the processing file second.

I have only seen an option to publish snappy apps manually.\nOr should I make this PPA thing? Can I put snappy apps on that?\n\nA: There is no stable public API for uploading apps to the store, no. Soon, any uploaded packages will require the author to sign them with gpg as well. Automating signing of your packages in a CI, would mean you'd need a private key with no password, and getting that key into a CI system may mean needing to have it published in a public location, thus compromising the integrity of any signature.\nAlso, no, you cannot publish snap packages into PPAs.

I am setting up a server with ubuntu 14.04 LTS OS installed. I have two 1TB sata disks and two 2TB sata disks(configured with RAID 1 for both). I am using the 1TB ones for the OS and also other things, but for my database I want to use 2TB disks.\nI have installed postgresql on my server, but I want to have all the data of the database to get stored on the 2TB one. \nSo I want some assistance in how to do that. I mean how to set the home or the data_directory of my postgresql database so that the data gets stored on the 2TB one directly.\nI would appreciate if the help is given starting from mount point.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Actually this is quite simple. All you have to do is specify a path when creating a database cluster. This comes from the postgresql documentation. The command to create a new pg cluster is initdb and looks like this:\ninitdb [option...] [--pgdata | -D] directory\nAccording to the documentation,initdb will create the specified directory unless it has no privileges to write to the target location. To be safe you can create it as root and then change ownership to postgres system user. In my system (used for development) I created a directory under /home (on a raid1 array) that belongs  to postgres and ran the initdb against that directory.\ncd /home\nsudo mkdir postgres\nsudo chown postgres:postgres postgres\ninitdb [your db creation options here] --pgdata /home/postgres\nNow you can start the postgresql server specifying the pgdata directory. For example, \npg_ctl start -D /home/postgres\nwill start a server instance that makes uses of your specified directory. If a server instance is already running you may wish to replace start with restart. This will bring down the running server and start it with the new options.\nOn a side note, as you may have already guessed, it is possible to have multiple instances of the server running at the same time (on different ports of course), each managing a separate cluster (ie physical path).\n\nA: I'm not sure where postgres stores its data, I would think /var/lib/postgresql/. If you want to use the 2tb exclusively for postgres data, you could do the following: (I don't have postgres running atm, please check paths and names. This works for any service type though, so as well on postgres.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop postgres sudo service postgres stop\n\n*mv data dir: sudo mv /var/lib/postgresql /var/lib/postgresql.bak\n\n*sudo mkdir /var/lib/postgresql\n\n*create a filesystem and mount the new drive to /var/lib/postgresql\n\n*change owner and group to postgres and change access rights (chown and chmod, you can check the old settings from ls -la /var/lib/postgresql.bak)\n\n*Copy the postgres data back: cp -ra /var/lib/postgresql.bak/. /var/lib/postgresql\n\n*restart postgres: service postgres start\n", "Q: How to fix apt after doing easy_install pip? I ran into the following error while using pip: \"pip stops with ImportError for request-Modul\"\nI read on a forum that an easy solution was to just apt-get remove pip and then to do easy_install pip. I did this, and it did indeed make pip start working again.\nHowever, I later read that using easy_install is a bad idea and can break apt's package management. So my question is, how do I \"undo\" whatever easy_install did and get apt to manage pip properly again?\n\nA: What you have to do:\nReinstall the python-pip package with apt and afterwards upgrade your pip to the latest version with pip itself or easy_install if it is broken.\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade pip || sudo easy_install --upgrade pip\n\n\nWhy you should do that:\napt only installs packages it finds in your installed repositories, but the python packages in the official repositories are incredibly outdated! However, some packages you might install in the future may list python-pip as dependency and and require that package to be installed. They won't recognize it if you installed it without apt. Also, the man command does not work for pip then as only apt creates a manpage for it, easy_install does not.\neasy_install and pip however don't fetch their packages from any repository, but from PyPI (Python Package Index), which always holds the latest available versions.\nSo my suggestion is to use pip instead of apt to update python packages if you want current versions. easy_install is the ancestor of pip and should usually be avoided and replaced by pip, but as long as it's broken, you have to use it. You could also do a sudo pip install --upgrade pip to get the latest pip version without easy_install.\nIf you don't have the pip package installed by apt, then just do it additionally. I did not remove python-pip with apt before upgrading it with pip or easy_install and it also works. As apt installs the old pip version in /usr/bin and pip/easy_install use the directory /usr/local/bin, which has the higher priority, a plain call to pip without giving an explicit directory always runs the newer version, if more than one is installed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 (Gnome): Laptop Display Blank After Undocking I've been experiencing a really annoying issue with my recent Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 install. The OS is running on a Lenovo T440s.  At the office I have a dock that connects to two monitors, one is connected through VGA and one is connected through DVI.  So far, so good.\nThe problem starts when I put my laptop to sleep while it's docked and connected to these monitors.

I've been using this guide as my go-to for how to install Ubuntu onto my desktops, particularly the partition scheme:\nhttp://www.tecmint.com/ubuntu-14-04-installation-guide/\nHowever, I've realised my primary desktop setup has evolved to the point where I might want to modify it on a future reinstall. Specifically, I want to use a RAM disk setup. I've just upgraded to 16GB of RAM (which is way more than most of my tasks will require for ordinary memory) and I believe there are methods of making the disk dynamically resize according to the system's actual memory requirements (or am I thinking about the SWAP file?).\nTherefore, is it still a good idea to have the SWAP partition set to twice the total RAM size (so a total of 32GB) as the guide says, if indeed the RAM disk can resize according to memory requirements? I'd rather save some of the SWAP for more HOME partition space. The HDD is 1TB.\nI'm also going to ask a similar question about my Gigabyte BRIX 2807 micro desktop setup. I have a maximised 8GB of RAM, and again I'd like to use a fair portion of that for a RAM disk. I also have an SSD, so I'd like to optimise it's write life cycle. I'm going to follow this guide:\nhttp://bernaerts.dyndns.org/linux/74-ubuntu/250-ubuntu-tweaks-ssd\nTherefore, considering my prior question, was it also a good idea to set the SWAP to 16GB or twice the RAM size? Should I resize the SWAP partition to account for both the envisioned RAM disk and the optimisation of the SSD's write life cycle? Or not, preventing me from having to reinstall?\nThe distro on each desktop is Ubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: There is no valid reason any more to have multiple partitions, esp. on personal desktops/laptops. This is even reflected in the default setting for the partition manager: everything on a single partition.\nI don't bother with a swap partition. IIRC, the Ubuntu installer won't let you install without one, so pick the smallest size you can get away with, and after you've installed, turn swap off permanently. Esp. if you have an SSD, you don't want gratuitous writes if you can avoid them. I haven't run a machine with swap in at least half a dozen years.\nAs for the ramdisk, what's the point of having one if you're going to back it up with disk? Just use the disk directly! I also assume you mean 'tmpfs', not a real old-style ramdisk, right?\nHope this helps,\n/ji\n\nA: A RAMDISK is a block device that is backed by your RAM. Think of it as a way to use your RAM as a 'hard drive' in the sense you could read/write files to it, however all the limitations of RAM would still apply - notably that it's volatile and rebooting your server would cause all data on that drive to be lost.\nA Swap partition on the other hand is a way for your computer to use Hard disk space as a form of \"Slow RAM\" - when you run out of RAM, your computer can start to use the swap partition to keep things running. Obviously this is bad, as hard drives are significantly slower than RAM is.\nI can't really elaborate much more on the rest of your question, as I think you may have confused some of the terminology.\nPersonally, I keep my /home directory on another disk entirely, and / on an SSD, allowing for system reinstalls without losing most of the data. \n\nA: The suggestions of setting your swap size to be 2x the size of your RAM are based on very old recommendations and don't apply to modern systems. \nAt a very high level, swap is only used when you run more programs than you have memory to hold them, so the least used memory is written out to swap until it's needed again, at which point it's traded for something else to be written out.\nWhy would a computer with only 2GB RAM require 4GB swap (effectively 6GB RAM) while a computer with 32GB RAM require 64GB swap (effectively 96GB RAM)? You will easily use up all of the memory on a 2GB RAM machine in day to day use, but would be hard pressed to use 32GB RAM under most situations. 2x your RAM as a general rule just doesn't make sense.\nInstead, look at your normal usage, monitor the memory used, and then add a little paddinge for safety.

Apart from the weirdness it's also much slower.\n\nA: This shortcut existed in terminals as an interrupt shortcut far before the era of graphical interfaces and copy/paste.\nHowever, I understand your frustration. When switching from GUI universes like Windows and years of copy/pasting with Ctrl+c it's difficult to change your habits.\nDepending on the terminal software you use, you can change this comportement and swap the usage of Ctrl+c and Ctrl+Shift+ c.\nAlternative solution you can use like I did the Autokey software to achieve this.\n\nAutoKey is a desktop automation utility for Linux and X11. It allows you to manage collection of scripts and phrases, and assign abbreviations and hotkeys to these. This allows you to execute a script or insert text on demand in whatever program you are using.\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*When you create a new entry in Autokey, choose Script\n\n*In the textarea, paste : keyboard.send_keys(\"<shift>+<ctrl>+c\")\n\n*In the Hotkey input field, select Ctrl+c\n\n*In the Window filter, select your terminal emulator by clicking on Set, then Detect window properties, then clicking on your terminal app, and finally by choosing \"Window class\". It will restrict this hotkey to these categories of windows.\n\n\nYou can do also the same, for Ctrl+v and Ctrl+Shift+c\nI was a heavy user of Autohotkey on Windows. Autokey is far less powerful and is badly unmaintained since years. However, on my distribution (Xubuntu), it still works partially, and I use it mainly for text expanding and to override shortcut definitions in applications.\n\nA: Because Ctrl+C in terminal traditionally means \"send interrupt signal to the running program\". The terminal is being consistent with itself and its legacy, not with other programs.\nMore info here\n", "Q: blank transparent window on startup unity 15.04 starting off my computer I noticed an unknown blank transparent window:\n\nwhat is this?\nit also looks like some preferences I had set have been lost (a specific resolution for a second monitor and default CTR-ALT-T shortcut for Terminator); I tried apt-get update and dist-upgrade but the situation is still the same,\nI'm running 15.04 and kernel  4.2.0-040200rc3-generic(upstream)\n\nA: I think that running xprop and selecting this blank window will help you to know which process creates it.\n", "Q: How to I re-activate \"history\" on firefox?T The \"history\" dropdown has quit working, as have \"File\", \"Edit\", and the rest at the top of the firefox toolbar.

I have two displays and only the one with the launch-bar is affected. Viz screenshot. Subsequently closing dash suppresses the problem altogether. This makes dash completely unusable.\nThe scrambled visual is not fixed but changes with average frequency 1 Hz. While the one display runs crazy the other one is fine and I can continue working on it as if nothing was happening. So my GPU is fine. This is an x86 based HP box.\nFrom terminal:\n$ uname -r\n3.16.0-46-generic\n$ unity --version\nunity 7.2.5\n$ lspci -nn | grep VGA\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation G84GLM [Quadro FX 570M] [10de:040c] (rev a1)\n\nEarlier today I had done, from terminal, sudo apt-get upgrade which resulted in the upgrade of freshplayerpluginfrom ppa and:\n...\nRemoving linux-headers-3.13.0-61-generic (3.13.0-61.100) ...\nRemoving linux-headers-3.13.0-61 (3.13.0-61.100) ...\nRemoving linux-image-extra-3.13.0-61-generic (3.13.0-61.100)\n...\n\nI have since then purged freshplayerplugin, and ran sudo apt-get autoremove to rebuild a clean grub2 menu.\nI use X.Org X server - Nouveau Display driver and I have not changed anything recently, in my GPU driver config . Could it still be a driver problem related to a recent kernel release ? (I have the auto-update enabled for security releases).\nCheers.\n\nA: After selecting the NVIDIA binary driver - version 340.76 from nvidia-340 (proprietary, tested) for my GPU, I restarted my box and the problem went away.\nI surmise that after a kernel version minor update (perhaps requiring a restart, but I did not see that recommendation), the dash shell's gui's old dependencies were somehow not met when using the X.Org X server Nouveau Display Driver. That however strikes me as odd and it may not have anything to do with one driver or another. \n", "Q: requirements and settings to be able to stream a larger video(20 minutes over 200 meg, mp4) on a ubuntu server running apache2, php5.4 and fastcgi? I've got it working on smaller videos using owncloud , Ubuntu 14.04, apache2 fast CGI, etc. It works on a 1 minute video but if it is longer than 2 minutes it has to download the whole file before it streams. In php.INI I have set the cache to 2 gig, have set the mime types in apache2.conf. I tried installing the flv streamer but it still remains the same that small videos stream but larger ones have to wait to download.

I ended up dumping apache2 and going over to lighttpd with all the various mods to get it going. It would work for androids and windows but due to the headers not sending correctly it wouldn't work at all with IOS. Owncloud didn't like Lighttpd and spat out a heap of errors. I persevered but came to an end and went back to a snapshot I had with Apache2. I checked my error logs again and the issue was firmly pointed at xsendfile. I modified my settings for Xsendfile and got it working.\nTo get it working this is assuming you have a setup running with php and the fastcgi modules installed, etc. If you can get a video to play after it downloads the whole video first then this is for you!\nCode:\napt-get install libapache2-mod-xsendfile\ninside your server ssl file add the code\nCode:\n\n    ...\n    SetEnv MOD_X_SENDFILE_ENABLED 1\n    XSendFile On\n    XSendFilePath /\n\nBear in mind to test it start with this >>>> XsendFilePath / <<<<<<<\nWhen it works lock it down a little better say where the webserver data directory is.

Each vm has an outdated Ubuntu OS in Command Line. although i figured out how to access it through root access. I would like to switch interface into a GUI for me to learn more about it easily. Thank you!\n\nA: You shouldn't do that if you ask me.\nNevertheless apt-get install xubuntu-desktop as root (or with sudo) should install an xfce desktop. For alternatives you can install lubuntu-desktop (lxde), ubuntu-desktop (unity) or kubuntu-desktop (kde) as well.\nIf you would start under me and would pull that, you would be in trouble. You can (and should) learn on your desktop and you'll need to learn to rely on the command line for the job.\nLast but not least, ubuntu 12.04 isn't outdated yet, it is still supported with updates until April 2017. \n\nA: The official docs are on ubuntu.com/ServerGUI.\nThe answer is to use this commands in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install xorg openbox\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 freezes I have looked at other similar questions asking about how to fix generic \"Ubuntu xx.xx randomly freezes\" but have not been able to conclusively find an answer to this exact problem: Ubuntu 15.04 seems to freeze randomly on me. \nI don't know exactly what's happening, but it would appear Ubuntu is still receiving input (at least from the keyboard): at the end of the second syslog paste (see the link to pastebin), you can see I attempted Alt+PrtScn+REISUB, but for whatever reason that failed. Attempting to switch to a console via Ctrl+Alt+F1 does nothing.\nThe system logs don't even seem to show the same cause each time. See below for system stats and two crash logs from syslog.\nIf there is any additional information I can provide to assist in troubleshooting, I'll do my best to add it ASAP.

I have Ubuntu and Windows 7 side by side on my PC, and after I started the upgrade to Windows 10, I couldn't boot to continue the upgrade. Booting results only in Grub rescue prompt. \nI've tried using boot-repair with no results (http://paste.ubuntu.com/12243604/) and I tried repairing the MBR with windows 10 installation iso, and it still doesn't fix the problem. \nSince then I tried fixing the problem manually by enabling EFI in BIOS and i tried running the command bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi in Windows 10 installer, but nothing have helped so far.\nI've also been looking around in the grub rescue menu, and all partitions shows as msdos partitions.

I turned UEFI off and after some random fiddling and being stubborn, the upgrade process has resumed.\nDo note that this nukes ubuntu from the boot order!\n\nA: Part of the problem is that Windows 7 doesn't use UEFI, and Windows 10 certainly does.\nThe Windows 10 'install/upgrade' utility (I really hesitate to use that word) somehow tricks the PC/laptop into changing its behaviour 'during the install/re-boot process'. It also overrides the boot order, with the 'failsafe' \"Press key to boot from CD/DVD\" to fix its own mistakes. \nThat means you need a quite recent BIOS or .. (You already found out what!)\nPS: It also means picking legacy boot, the correct boot order, etc. isn't necessarily going to help very much.\n\nYour problems are:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to complete the 'upgrade' to gain the 'activated' Windows 10 license. The only shortcut here is buy a license, and just install Windows 10.\n\n*You likely need to not go back to a 'factory install' of Windows 7 (as supplied by vendor), then start over. If you had an OEM install, then that brand of installer DVD (obtained/borrowed from wherever) will get you back to installed/activated with Windows 7. Then hunt down any missing drivers (from PC vendor's website), and don't forget to get all Windows updates. Then try again.\n\n*However, after 'succeeding' you will still want to do a 'clean install' of Windows 10. So start by getting the ISO file and creating an install USB (using Rufus: https://rufus.akeo.ie/), for any upgrades or re-installs. Lastly, follow these instructions: Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n\nA: Use Windows 10 in a Virtualbox environment if you have sufficient memory.  Never use Windows as a your primary OS unless you absolutely have to.  It is also a lot easier to backup your Windows 10 Virtualbox, all you have to do is copy a folder to an external drive.  Furthermore, you can use your Windows 10 virtual machine on ANY computer with Virtualbox.

It seems like MAAS DHCP is allocating that private IP. \nOur questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How we can assign the Public IP to landscape so that we can access it from the outside?\n\n*What's the use of the 2 machines that we have used for openstack installation thus-far. It seems like its deploying everything on the one node from MAAS.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the easiest for now is to access Landscape on the ip address given.  You can use something like sshuttle or ssh -D to get access to an environment quite easily with almost no setup.\nIf you need to create an external IP, the IP address you create needs to be accessible to all the nodes, and the outside.Then you can make a change to the Landscape juju environment like this:\nexport JUJU_HOME=~/.cloud-install/juju\njuju set apache2 servername=<hostname-you-want>\n\nFollow juju debug-log and you should see the charms reacting to the change and updating the root_url correctly.\nOnce you have access to Landscape, you can continue with installing the OpenStack cloud on the remaining 3 machines.  As it is from your description, it sounds like you have this right now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Machine 1: MAAS\n\n*Machine 2: Landscape\n\n*Machines 3-5: unused\n\n\nWhen you login to Landscape, you will need to continue following the instructions on the page you linked to.\n\nA: I think you ought to be able to either...\n1) create a file called ~/.juju/openstack.cfg with a section like:\n   openstack-dashboard:\n     vip: '10.10.10.10'\n   ...and then when you deploy the dashboard you'd do so with:\n   juju deploy --config=.juju/openstack.cfg openstack-dashboard\n   ...which should use the virtual IP address that you've selected.\n2) once you've already deployed the dashboard and (if you've also\n   deployed juju-gui) then in the Juju-Gui console you'd click\n   the Dashboard service, click the Settings button, scroll down\n   the panel on the left and look for the VIP setting.

However I try holding one or the other Shift keys, tapping, tapping then holding, nothing works. Am I missing something? How does one access the GRUB menu during boot time? \nNo dual boot here, just standard Lubuntu 14.04 install. \n\nA: I had the same problem. The system would boot directly and my monitor would be in out-of-range mode. I pressed ↑ repeatedly until I thought GRUB was waiting for a command, then I pressed ↓, Enter, ↓ to select recovery mode.\nIt took a few tries or randomness, but when I entered recovery mode the display came back. I then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Selected root for a root prompt\n\n*Ran mount -o rw,remount / to mount the filesystem in read-write mode\n\n*Ran vi /etc/default/grub\n\n*Removed # from GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\n*Saved the file\n\n*Ran update-grub to update GRUB\n\n*Ran exit to return to the menu and continue booting\n\n\nGRUB would show up, the monitor would work, and then I could log in.\n\nA: I also cannot access the GRUB menu by any manner of pressing shift or esc on my Asus X205TA. To get the GRUB menu to display at boot, I had to modify the /etc/default/grub file. See this page.\nTo get the GRUB menu to display every time (until I change it back) I used nano to edit the file in the terminal. Type:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nfind the line that says GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 or GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden\nput # at the start of this line to comment it out\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\nor\n#GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden\n\nand make sure GRUB_TIMEOUT=10 or some other number bigger than zero. When done exit nano saving changes and run\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: I am answering this question in hope that it will help someone else in the Future.\nUsually you are right in trying to get to Grub with Shift! But Grub usually explicitly prohibits using the Shift key if you have \"Fastboot\" enabled:\nif [ \"\\${fastboot}\" = \"1\" ]; then\n  # timeout_style=menu + timeout=0 avoids the countdown code keypress check\n  set timeout_style=menu\n  set timeout=0\n\nTaken from /etc/grub.d/12_menu_auto_hide\nBut the other people who answered in here are right aswell, but I think for a different problem. If the Grub menu does not start automatically on start up, you can try fiddeling with your /etc/default/grub file.\nOpen it with sudo rights:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nAnd there you should see two entries of importance to us:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT= \"some number, probably 0 or 5\"\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE= hidden/menu/countdown\n\nGRUB_TIMEOUT tells us how long Grub will wait for Input until it loads the default OS.\n\n*\n\n*0 will instantly choose the default OS\n\n*-1 will wait on user input indefinitely\n\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE tells you how the Grub menu is shown, if at all\n\n*\n\n*hidden= Hides grub unless you press Shift in time\n\n*menu= Will show Grub\n\n*countdown= Will not show grub, but an actual Countdown\non screen\n\nHope that helped\n(more info on the other entries in /etc/default/grub Ubuntu Wiki\n\nA: I have an X200MA. To enter the GRUB menu, you press Esc while booting. Choose Ubuntu to boot normally.\nYou may have problems if you installed Ubuntu not in UEFI mode. I did not test it that way.\n\nA: There are three issues that make getting into the grub menu difficult on some systems.\n\n*\n\n*The timing of when to hit a key to abort the hidden menu feature is tricky\n\n*Holding down the shift key doesn't always work because some bioses will think the key is stuck and clear it or give an error on stuck key\n\n*Some video cards will not be initialized yet when the menu should come up, and the screen will be black, causing you to miss it\n\nThe first two problems can be bypassed by using capslock instead of shift.\nThe trick is to press caps lock during boot and watch the capslock light.  When it goes out, hit capslock again to turn it back on, and keep doing that until either you get the grub menu or you realize you've missed the timing again.\nOnce you've gotten past the hidden menu and gotten the grub menu, you need to turn off capslock and then interact with the menu before the menu timeout occurs and it selects the default item.\nIf you have a system with timing issues or video card initialization issues with grub, I strongly recommend you use one of the other answers here to permanently disable the hidden menu feature and/or force text console mode, as appropriate.  You will need to either boot successfully to do this -- either normally, via rescue options in the grub menu, or by booting the Ubuntu install media and invoking rescue mode from there.\nWhen I'm installing ubuntu on a machine that has known problems like this, I'll use the \"try ubuntu before installing\" option and before it finishes, edit /etc/default/grub to disable hidden menu.   This can be done during install or before rebooting at the end.  Make sure update-grub gets rerun after you make that edit, either as part of the install or manually.\n", "Q: i-nex package throws an error with any apt-get command I'm trying to install some packages and got an error related to i-nex package.\n# apt-get install yum\nReading package lists...

You know, the ones that contain \"(1).\", \"(2).\", \"(3).\", etc. in their names.  In a terminal window, at the command line, you type in \"rm \"[backslash]\").\", but without the quotes.  That will do it.  The [backslash]  \"\\\" means the next character is accepted as just a character, not part of a pair of parentheses.  This works when nothing else will.  Incidently, I tried to type the \"\\\" into the \"rm\" command, but it failed to display properly, so I put the term [backslash] there instead.\nThe appearance of \"\\ \" in a folder or a filename shows the presence of a space there as well.  The use of spaces in names is not all that common, unless you work with Windows.  Windows just has you bracket the \"whole path\\file name\" in double quotes.  You can do that in Ubuntu as well, or just stick a backslash \"\\\" in front of the space.  But what if you want to replace the space with a different character instead?  Like a hyphen or underscore?  How would you do that for all folders and files at once?\nOr what if you decide to just remove the spaces, just pack the rest of the characters together?  How would you do that?\nAnd here is a toughy:  Just get rid or any leading or trailing spaces. even if there is more than one present.\nAnd to wrap it up,  how to detect and delete and files that are completely empty.

Since it displays a black screen, we know it sended the request and since it has nothing to do, it just prints a black screen.

The default is to disable the password.\n\n           Note: This option is not recommended because the password (or encrypted password) will be\n           visible by users listing the processes.\n\n           You should make sure the password respects the system's password policy.\n\nThe above confuses me because when i type the command\nuseradd -m -p password1\nthe password password1 is visible on the command line. How to make it invisible in the above command?\n\nA: Try adding an argument after each option you want to use. For example:  \n    useradd -m guest_user -p passwd1\n\nAs the useradd man page suggests, adding your password in this way is not considered secure because it is transmitted in plain text. For an alternative, try: \n    sudo useradd -m guest_user\n\nand then: \n    sudo passwd guest_user\n\nTwo caveats: \n\n\n*\n\n*the line that begins with: NAME_REGEX= in: /etc/adduser.conf may prohibit the use of the underscore \"_\" character for usernames;  \n\n*there may be password complexity requirements set in: /etc/pam.d/common-password which require a more complex password. \n\nA: An alternative to doing what you want is:\n$ sudo su\n# useradd -m USER && echo \"USER:PASSWORD\" | chpasswd\n\n\nA: From man useradd :\n-p, --password PASSWORD\n           The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3). The default is to disable the password.\n\nAs you can see the PASSWORD with -p option is the encrypted password returned by the crypt(3) library function.\nIf you use -p password1, the system will consider this plain text password1 as the encrypted shadow password entry in /etc/shadow.\nThe solution is to use the encrypted password here with -p which is unsafe, you should set the password interactively.\nFor example create the user first :\nsudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash guest_user\n\nNow set the password :\nsudo passwd guest_user\n\nOr better use adduser instead :\nsudo adduser --gecos '' guest_user\n\n\nA: You can use perl to print the encrypted password and use it with -p option in useradd command.\n$ sudo useradd -m -p $(perl -e 'print crypt($ARGV[0], \"password\")' 'YOUR_PASSWORD') username\n\nYou also can use it with other options like -s for Shell or -d for home directory.\n\nA: You can use the following function:\nmyAddUser() {\n      # check for this in '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow'\n      # $1 is the username\n      # $2 is the password\n      sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -m -p $(perl -e 'print crypt($ARGV[0], \"password\")' \"$2\") \"$1\" \n  }\n\nLike this:\n  myAddUser mostafa 1557 \"This is the only user\"\n\nYou can also source the function and use it as you wish!\n\nThis is a modification of Chhaileng answer.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu not starting post cuda installation I am running Ubuntu 14.04 alongside windows 8.1 on an HP Envy 15 laptop having Nvidia gtx 850m graphic card.

How can I revert updating?\n\nA: \"Is safe to update kernel from PPA mainline?\"\nThe Mainline builds wiki clearly states that \"These kernels are not supported and are not appropriate for production use.\"\nIt also states than \"The mainline kernels builds are produced for debugging purposes and therefore come with no support. Use them at your own risk.\"\nMainline builds also don't include the Ubuntu patches normally applied to the kernel in the Ubuntu repository and alsi if there is a minimal or important security update you won't get it as you manually installed the .deb files.\nUninstalling upstream kernels\nThe upstream kernels have their own ABI namespace, so they install side by side with the stock Ubuntu kernels (each kernel has a separate directory under /lib/modules/VERSION for example). This means that you can keep several mainline and Ubuntu stock kernels installed at the same time and select the one you need from the GRUB boot menu.\nIf you would like to uninstall an upstream kernel anyway, execute the following to find the exact name of the kernel packages you want to uninstall:\ndpkg -l | grep \"linux-[a-z]*-\"\nand then execute the following to uninstall them:\nsudo apt-get remove KERNEL_PACKAGES_TO_REMOVE\nRemember that several packages can belong to one kernel version: common headers, architecture specific headers and the architecture specific image.\nAlso, once the mainline packages are removed, one may still see entries for these via the above dpkg command.

To change the permission of a subfolder is not enough. The whole path need the right permissions.\nEither you change the group for /localdata too via \nsudo chgrp perma /localdata\n\nand to be sure\nsudo chmod g+x /localdata\n\n\nor you set the the search permission for directories x for all users\nsudo chmod o+x /localdata\n\n\nA: In the case of an NFS server, the server controls who has access to a file. This means that you need to set the permissions on the server, not locally. So basically you need to ask your server admin to create a perma group and add you to it. \n", "Q: MAAS - PXE won't boot images I'm currently trying to set up a maas/openstack environment for testing purpuses, but I've got problems with deploying the nodes.\nWhen I start the node that is connected to the private network of my Cluster controller it boots from PXE but land on \"GNU GRUB version 2.02 beta2-9ubuntu1.3\", not booting the Image that I downloaded under \"Images\" are there any logs that could help me further, it seems like there is a problem with the image being sen via pxe or my config of the standard pxe file to use\nTrying to import the pxe files gives me: sudo: maas-import-pxe-files: command not found\n\nA: Either you're confused or I am.  My take on this is that the PXE step boots up an Ubuntu image that's pre-arranged.  You say...\n\n\"...not booting the Image that I downloaded under 'Images'...\"\n\n...which, to me, suggests that you've got OpenStack running, that you're in the website which looks like https://someipaddress/horizon, you're in the Admin section and you've clicked the Create Image button under Images.  You then selected an ISO image or similar from somewhere and you allowed that to download.\nAt this point then, it wants you to \"create an instance\" (a.k.a. \"spin up a virtual machine from this image\").  Upon doing so, OpenStack then will throw the work to the scheduler which will attempt to filter the existing available nodes and find a good place for this to be placed.

I am currently dual booting. Is this normal? If not, what might be the cause?\n\nA: Given that the question has no other clues (besides the absence of shutdown log), I can only provide the answer by guessing based on my experience only.\n\nIs this normal?\n\nI can't tell, but may be normal for your current setup (which I don't know how you set up the dual-boot with Linux Mint). But if you were to compare with mine, yours is not normal.\nI have a quite aged, second hand, circa-2005 single-core machine. This machine has been installed with Xubuntu 14.04 to primary partition and multiboot with other distro (always changing, but Linux Mint 17 was one of them) on other partitions.\nYet, the machine can shut down Xubuntu 14.04 in less than 10 seconds--this is my normal.\n\nIf not, what might be the cause?\n\nFrom here onwards is just guessing, talking about possibilities (which I can think of, but not necessarily have experience) for your case. You may check from the listing below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Did you setup shared partitions between Xubuntu and Linux Mint? Sharing partition such as /home may cause slow access, depending on their compatibility. However, this issue is irrelevant for sharing /swap partition.\n\n*Did you setup encrypted partitions on Xubuntu? Unmounting encrypted partition may behave differently than non-encrypted ones.\n\n*Did you setup RAID array for your Xubuntu? Occasional bug may present for systems that has been installed with RAID configuration.\n\n*Which Xubuntu release are you using? Regular releases such as 14.10, 15.04 etc. occasionally introduce issues which are not present on LTS releases. Booting or shutdown issue could be one of them. Read the release note of your release on this Ubuntu Wiki.\n\n*Is the partition where Xubuntu been installed has disk error or having corrupted filesystem? You could use fsck to check disk error (backup first, because running fsck may have risk of making any corrupted filesystem even worse), or see if reinstalling Xubuntu will make any difference (as last resort).\nBesides above, if Linux Mint boots and shutdown fine on the same hard disk, there is likely something amiss with your current setup for Xubuntu. That is all I can say.\nUpdated: I just found this post which has similar symptoms like your case. The answer suggests \"The wrong driver is loaded which prevents shutdown\".\n\nA: So, this was pretty stupid, but I solved the issue. The key was to change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to quiet from quiet splash in /etc/default/grub, so I could see what was happening during shut down. As alluded to here, there's not really a system log for shut downs, so removing the splash screen helps.\nAnyway, I'd placed a script in /etc/init.d to try to manage wifi some time ago. It wasn't compliant with init script formatting, so I  gather it was taking the system some time to terminate the script. I don't know why I just recently noticed the delayed shutdown time. \n", "Q: Can't view Ubuntu Server (VM) in browser, I can connect with SSH I can't seem to be able to access my php files in a browser from my external ip.\nI have a Ubuntu Server VM set up on my Windows desktop. I also have a Windows laptop that I use (99% of the time, it's outside the network). I have OpenSSH on the server. The server has a bridged adapter setup (Promiscuous Mode: Deny). For ease, lets say the internal ip of the server is 1.1.1.1 (listening on port 2222) and the exernal ip of my home network is 2.2.2.2.\nI set up port forwarding so that when I access 2.2.2.2:2222, I forward to the interal ip of 1.1.1.1:2222.

I installed a python package (django) using sudo apt-get install python-django. Now I want to upgrade to the latest version.\nShould I run sudo pip install -U django, or should I uninstall first the python-django installed with apt-get?\n\nA: sudo apt-get install python-django installs django in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages while sudo pip install -U django installs django in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages. This means you cannot upgrade Django installed by APT using pip and vice versa.\nThe latest version of django is unlikely to be provided by the official Ubuntu repositories. Therefore, I would suggest you uninstall the django that is installed using apt-get and then either use pip install --user django to install django locally or use virtual environments such as virtualenv to manage your Python dependencies. I would discourage you from using sudo pip install django because it is a security risk to use sudo to install arbitrary Python packages from PyPI which does not check for malicious packages; you can read more about this from an answer I wrote regarding this issue.\n", "Q: Understanding complex psql command I was just going through an online tutorial on psql and came across the following command: \npsql -U user -d postgres -f ~/Desktop/pgrouting-workshop/data/sampledata_notopo.sql\n\nI am just wondering what all those parameters -d and -f, I am new to Ubuntu and don't even know what keyword to search for, So that i could get the documentation for those flags. \nCan somebody break it down for me?\n\nA: As another user pointed out, in Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions), you can typically find man (manual) pages with the man command, e.g.: \n    man psql \n\nwhich would give you a \"man page\" on how to use the \"psql\" command. Alternatively, you can also try the info command, e.g.: \n    info man \n\nwhich would give you information on the \"man\" command. \nFor a brief overview of man vs. info, look here. \nThe psql command as you are using it can be broken down: \n    psql \n\n(the command itself) \n    -U user \n\n(connect as the user named \"user\") \n    -d postgres \n\n(to the database named postgres) \n    -f ...\n\n(use the filename located at ... as the source for the queries, as opposed to interactively ). \nIn brief, Linux commands generally take the form: \n    command -option(s) arguments . \n\n", "Q: Full update package?

Is there an application that I can install in my Ubuntu laptop and will allow me to transfer files via wifi to and from my Android device, which has Zapya installed?\n\nA: I have never used zapya and don't recommend it\nWhen I tried to download the Zapya for PC, I got a warning from Chrome that the page may contain malware. In any case, their web page said nothing about a Linux/Ubuntu download.\nHere is an alternate solution\nFrom Google Play store install Web PC Suit app into your android device.\nOpen the App. You will see something like this:\n\nNote there are two web addresses shown. The first will need internet connection and show a qrcode, that you can scan using the app. You don't need to do this if you are concerned that contents of your Android device will be exposed to the Internet!\nUse the local IP address, the second line with http://. The second line looks like a bunch of numbers: 192.168.0.7:8080. Yours will be different. Don't copy the number (also known as IP address) from this answer.\nType the IP address shown in the app, into your PC's web browser such as Firefox. Make sure the dots .s and the : are in the right places.\nYou will see a notice in the android app telling your someone is trying to connect to your android device. That someone is you! touch the Accept button.\nThe rest should be easy.\nWhat is going on?\nThe Android app is basically a small web server that exposes the content of your Android device in a web page via a local IP address. You access the web page by typing the IP address in your browser.\nThe same content is forwarded to the App maker's external web server when you scan the QRCode, as this allows the app to communicate to the external server.\nIs it safe?\nIt has some safeguards, such as if anyone tries to connect to the App (the web server in your Android device) then the app asks you to accept or reject. You should not accept the connection if you did not initiate it from your own PC.\nBeyond this, I can't say how safe it is. If you don't trust the App maker and Google's system of vetting apps, you should not use it.\nThere are other similar tools like AirDroid that do file transfers the same way as above, and more.\nHope this helps\n\nA: You should install in your Android device a FTP server. Example:\nFTP Server for Android\nThen you must install a FTP client in your Ubuntu. You can use Filezilla.\nFinally connect from your Ubuntu to your Android.

I'm used to installing newest kernels on my machine.\nI always keep an eye on the latest release from this site and now it says that the latest v4.2 is stable.\nAfter that I'm used to downloading the kernel I choose from this site where now I can see that from v4.1 all versions are unstable.\nSo I'd like to know which one is telling the truth.\nThanks\n\nA: They are both telling the truth. Having gone through 8 Release Candidates, the kernel.org version of 4.2 is considered stable. In about two weeks you will observe kernel 4.3 RC1 there, and the process continues.\nNow, consider Ubuntu. Ultimately, the Ubuntu version, will have several changes additions and deletions that are not included in the mainline releases linked to. There are also patches applied to to the mainline for the debian packaging and changelog stuff in addition to kernel configuration settings. There simply must be a delay between the kernel.org version being declared stable and the actual Ubuntu version being created, tested on multiple and varied Ubuntu environments, and initially released. From the Ubuntu perspective the mainline PPA would never be considered \"stable\".\nEdit bodhi.zazen\nTo some extent the confusion is coming from the terminology used by kernel.org and Debian/Ubuntu, specifically the terms unstable/testing/stable.\nFrom https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html\nThe terms used are:\n\nPrepatch\nPrepatch or \"RC\" kernels are mainline kernel pre-releases that are\n  mostly aimed at other kernel developers and Linux enthusiasts. They\n  must be compiled from source and usually contain new features that\n  must be tested before they can be put into a stable release. Prepatch\n  kernels are maintained and released by Linus Torvalds.\nMainline\nMainline tree is maintained by Linus Torvalds. It's the tree where all\n  new features are introduced and where all the exciting new development\n  happens. New mainline kernels are released every 2-3 months.\nStable After each mainline kernel is released, it is considered \"stable.\" Any bug fixes for a stable kernel are backported from the\n  mainline tree and applied by a designated stable kernel maintainer.\n  There are usually only a few bugfix kernel releases until next\n  mainline kernel becomes available -- unless it is designated a\n  \"longterm maintenance kernel.\" Stable kernel updates are released on\n  as-needed basis, usually 2-3 a month.\nLongterm There are usually several \"longterm maintenance\" kernel releases provided for the purposes of backporting bugfixes for older\n  kernel trees. Only important bugfixes are applied to such kernels and\n  they don't usually see very frequent releases, especially for older\n  trees.\nDistribution kernels\nMany Linux distributions provide their own \"longterm maintenance\"\n  kernels that may or may not be based on those maintained by kernel\n  developers. These kernel releases are not hosted at kernel.org and\n  kernel developers can provide no support for them.\n\nDebian takes code from upstream (kernel.org in this case) and packages it. See https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-choosing.en.html\n\nUnstable has the most recent (latest) versions. But the packages in unstable are not well tested and might have bugs.\nOn the other hand, stable contains old versions of packages. But\n  this package is well tested and is less likely to have any bugs.\nThe packages in testing fall between these two extremes.\n\nAnd then there is the Ubuntu kernel team's ppa, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds\nThis last ppa provides the \"mainline\" , precompiled, for testing purposes.\nSo, when choosing what kernel to run you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain the source code from kernel.org, apply any patches you wish, and compile it yourself. You can choose:\n\n\nMainline - This kernel is the latest and most likely to have bugs.\nPrepatch - This kernel is \"pre-release\" , or in the development cycle one goes Latest (unstable) -> Alpha -> Beta -> Release Candidate/Pre-release -> Stable release (terms vary with project).\nStable - Released code, less likely to have bugs, good for general use.\nLong term - Very stable, at the sacrifice of new features.\nor 2. Use a \"distribution kernel\"\nDebian / Ubuntu then takes the source code from kernel.org , and applies patches, so the cycle repeats in what kernel.org would term a \"distribution kernel\".\nThe Debian/Ubuntu distribution kernel goes through a similar cycle Unstable -> testing -> stable\nThe kernel used by various versions of Ubuntu is listed here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubuntu_releases#Table_of_versions\nSo, at the time of release, Ubuntu is pulling from the \"stable\" upstream source code (15.10 is using kernel version 4.1).\nAt the time of this post, kernel 4.2 is the mainstream kernel, and thus not available in the Ubuntu repositories.\nYou can either compile the mainstream kernel yourself (I prefer this method) or install it from the ppa - http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nThese kernels are provided as is, as a convenient way for you to try the mainline kernel without having to compile it for yourself. It is unsupported and to some extent expected to have bugs.\nThey list the current mainstream kernel, 4.2, as unstable according to Debian policy (unstable -> testing -> stable) \nAs the other kernels listed there have undergone appropriate testing and patches they are eventually re-labeled as \"stable\"\n", "Q: could not switch on monitor configuration On my asus x553 I have wiped the hard drive to eliminate win 8.2 and installed Ubuntu 14.04.

Someone please tell me the steps to copy files and directories from internal hard drive to external hard drive using command line.\n\nA: One possibility would be for you to drop to the command prompt by pressing: \nCtrl+Alt+F1 (or any function key from F1 through F6). \nThis would bring you to a login prompt where you'd need to enter your username (press enter), then your password (press enter). \nFrom there you'll need to connect and then mount your external hard drive to your machine following these instructions. Once you've mounted the drive, you can use the cp command to copy your files from their source to the external hard drive destination.

I have commissioned three.  All have been allocated but they all boot to login prompt and then shutdown.  I did a standard install.  I'm not sure what log you'd like to see.  I've looked at logs in /var/log/maas, but I don't see anything that jumps out at me.  My nodes consist of an older Dell and two older Compaqs.  All PXE boot with only one error they all share (makes me think the problem is with the maas server).  The error is \nStarting seed the pseudo random number generator on first boot  [fail].\n\nThis message shows up a few lines sooner but then gives the [ok] messages.  All nodes receive DHCP assigned address without issue.\nWhat am I over looking?  Thank you.\n\nA: I think you can safely ignore the \"pseudo random number\" thing.  All of mine do that (about eight nodes so far).\nBelieve it or not, this is the expected behavior at this point.  The machine wakes up, checks in with MAAS, gets a temporary IP address, downloads some code, reports back its resources (you should see the RAM, number of cores and hard disk space in the console) and then... it shuts down.\nIf you have your BIOS set correctly then it will wake up again as required from MAAS.  BIOS should have the S3 option set in the Power-related section.  In many cases you'd set it so that it will boot up without complaining if there's no keyboard (in the POST section).  And just make sure that Wake On LAN (Onboard LAN Boot ROM) is set in the Integrated Peripherals section.\nThe commissioning step simply checks the system initially and I believe it also installs the Ubuntu system as well and runs update.  If you then click the Acquire button it will give the IP adapter an IP address with a longer lease (or perhaps a static IP address in this case) so that you can then, in theory, ssh to the box.  Note that you'll need to do an ssh-keygen in order to create a key pair and then paste that into the MAAS console in the SSH key area.  This should allow you then to do a:\nssh ubuntu@mynodename.domain\n\n...answer the yes/no question about whether or not you want to connect and then use the passphrase that you provided earlier in that ssh-keygen step.  So at this point then you'd have commissioned and provisioned an Ubuntu server and connected to it via ssh, the goal of a successful MAAS install.\nSo then if you want to continue on and install OpenStack on top of all this (assuming that you have two or more nodes now happy), you'd RELEASE that node so that it's back again in the READY state and can be deployed by Juju.\n", "Q: Downgrade kernel 3.19.0-26-generic to 3.13.0-62-generic I need to downgrade kernel version in my Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS production server from 3.19.0-26-generic to 3.13.0-62-generic.\nHow I can do it in safe way ?

It worked fine, with no errors, but my password hasn't been changed. I rebooted, but that didn't fix anything. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: If you really used command sudo passwd (with no additional argument), then you changed the password for the root account - not your user account. In Ubuntu, which locks the root account by default, this will have had the side effect of unlocking the root account.\nTo change your own user account password, you should simply type\npasswd\n\nand follow the prompts.

I can give you all the preliminary information and then maybe you can point me the in right direction.\nuname -r\nLinux myname 3.16.0-46-generic #62~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 11 16:27:16 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nlspci | grep 'VGA'\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n\nlsmod | grep 'video'\nuvcvideo               81073  0 \nvideobuf2_vmalloc      13216  1 uvcvideo\nvideobuf2_memops       13362  1 videobuf2_vmalloc\nvideobuf2_core         59104  1 uvcvideo\nv4l2_common            15681  1 videobuf2_core\nvideodev              153793  3 uvcvideo,v4l2_common,videobuf2_core\nmedia                  21903  2 uvcvideo,videodev\nvideo                  20128  1 i915\n\nSo, I gather from here my laptop is using Intel Onboard Graphics and i915 module that the kernel is loading. Then we come to X server.\ncat /var/log/Xorg.0.log\nXorg.log\nThe errors happens when X server starts looking for modules, intel, modesetting, etc. So, I assume I need to point it in the right direction with /etc/X11/xorg.conf, but I need to build one from scratch since X -config gives me the same errors as /etc/var/Xorg.0.log. So where can I generate an xorg.conf file from scratch? I get an error even trying to create one with Xorg -config or even sudo X :1 -configure. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Thank you in advance.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I never resolved this problem and ended up having to reinstall 15.04 from a boot disc. A couple of suggestions for those with similar issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the /etc/apt/source.list. One of the biggest issues I had with this problem was a corrupted files for my Xorg server. But I spent alot of wasted time figuring out why I couldn't apt-get install xserver-xorg. My source.list was changed to during the upgrade which prevented me from removing and reinstalling the server.\n\n*If you get a \"dependency\" nightmare, you can use aptitude instead of apt-get. This gave me a better understanding of why I couldn't do a clean remove and install. At this point, I realize that I probably had a few libraries missing or wrong versions of programs. This is where I decided it best to reinstall a fresh copy. In addition, I noticed a couple other programs were giving me problems.\n\n*Don't be scared to reinstall from disc. 15.04 Ubuntu has an option to reinstall your previous copy without overwriting your personal files. But it never hurts to backup. This version is running great, just needed to reinstall a couple of programs, but I can't complain. Good luck.\n\n", "Q: Simple Scan not recognizing Canon LiDE 25 I do sane-find-scanner and get:\nfound USB scanner (vendor=0x04a9 [Canon], product=0x2220 [CanoScan]) at libusb:002:002\n  # Your USB scanner was (probably) detected.

This involves making a few changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Making a Gnome terminal profile with the Solarized colors: https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized\n\n*Setting the LS colors: https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized\n\n*Setting my vim color scheme: https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized\nI want to do #2 and #3 only if #1 has already been done.  Eg, if I'm using the default terminal profile, trying to use solarized-vim looks horrible, so I would like to use a different color scheme for vim in that case.\nDoes gnome-terminal provide the shell any information about what profile it is running (eg, setting an environment variable or something), or is my challenge of automatically adapting across multiple terminal profiles impossible?\nThanks!\n\nA: Check whether $COLORFGBG is set, but as far as I recall it is not.\nThere are escape sequences to query the actual color, try the command xtermcontrol --get-fg but I'm almost sure that these weren't yet supported in Trusty.\nIf neither of the above worked:\nActually it's not gnome-terminal but the underlying libvte that matters.

The xtermcontrol --get-bg command should work now. (You'll get a much newer terminal engine with line rewrapping on resize and other cool features & bugfixes as well.)\n(Disclaimer: Make sure that xterm is installed and you can download the files of original vte3 belonging to your distribution, so that you can still restore the system in case anything goes wrong during the update.

Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/raise_window.py\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*To prevent an endless loop (e.g. in case the application doesn't run for some reason), the script will wait for ten seconds, then it terminates anyway. If you want to increase the time, change the value in the line:\nwhile t < 20\n\n(20 = 20 * 0.5 seconds)\n\n*As mentioned, you can use the script to \"fix\" the behaviour of any application that does not raise by itself, by changing the line:\napp = \"gnome-calculator\"\n\nto run another application (app = \"<application>\"), or:\nalternatively, to use the script for various applications:\nreplace the line:\napp = \"gnome-calculator\"\n\nby:\napp = sys.argv[1]\n\nand add in the head section of the script (directly below the shebang):\nimport sys\n\nThen run the script by the command:\npython3 raise_window.py <application>\n\nExplanation\nTo raise a window, you can use the command:\nwmctrl -ia <window_id> \n\nor \nwmctrl -a <window_name>\n\n(assuming wmctrl is installed)\nSince the window name is possibly not unique, The id is preferable to use. The trick is then to wait for the pid of the application to appear, testing with the command:\npgrep -f <application>\n\nIf the command has an output, it means the application has a pid and runs. The next thing is to see if the application has a window (already), by using the command:\nwmctrl -lp\n\nwhich will output a list of windows, their window-id and the corresponding (application's) pid. \nIf there is a match of the found pid and the windows in the list, we have our window that we need to raise. We can parse the window id from the window's line in the list, which we will subsequently use to raise the window with the command:\nwmctrl -ia <window_id>\n\n", "Q: Pipelight Silverlight not working in Firefox I installed pipelight and try to enable silverlight with\nsudo pipelight-plugin --enable silverlight\n\nAnd receive the message \"Plugin silverlight5.1 is now enabled\".

I have to read through various research papers and during the course I have to highlight and annotate. But if I rename the file later or change machine the highlights and annotations will be missing since they are stored separately. How can I preserve these highlights/annotations created in Okular if I change machines in the future?\n\nA: Current version of Okular allows one to save the PDF with the annotations by going into File -> Save As.\nHowever, I wanted something automated. So, I created an Autokey script so that whenever I close my PDF, the annotations are automatically saved in the PDF itself. Note that this script will save your PDF overwriting the original PDF.\nThe Autokey Script\nFirst, you will need to install autokey-gtk and xdotool first:\nsudo apt-get install autokey-gtk xdotool\n\nNow, in autokey, go to New -> Script. Add the following code to your new script:\n#This is used to save PDF in okular so that the annotations persist in the PDF file itself\n#We have to use to `xdotool` to bring the dialogs back into focus, otherwise they are losing focus \nimport subprocess\n\nkeyboard.send_keys(\"<ctrl>+<shift>+s\")\ntime.sleep(0.4)\nsubprocess.call([\"xdotool\", \"windowfocus\", \"`xdotool getwindowfocus`\"])\ntime.sleep(0.1)\nkeyboard.send_key(\"<enter>\")\ntime.sleep(0.1)\nsubprocess.call([\"xdotool\", \"windowfocus\", \"`xdotool getwindowfocus`\"])\ntime.sleep(0.1)\nkeyboard.send_key(\"<tab>\")\ntime.sleep(0.1)\nkeyboard.send_key(\"<enter>\")\ntime.sleep(0.1)\nsubprocess.call([\"xdotool\", \"windowfocus\", \"`xdotool getwindowfocus`\"])\ntime.sleep(0.5)\nkeyboard.send_keys(\"<ctrl>+q\") #Quit Finally\n\nYou can now assign a window filter and hotkey to this script. In window filter, add .*okular.*. And in hotkey, I've used <ctrl>+s. You could use anything else that you prefer.\nSo, now whenever I have to quit okular, I use CtrlS, and okular quits after saving my pdf. \n\nA: I think I have the answer. After running this simple find command in your Home directory:\nfind -type d -iname \"*okular*\" -print\nYou'll find this directory:\n/home/YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE/.kde/share/apps/okular\nunderneath it is the directory:\ndocdata\nThis docdata directory contains xml files for each document you've opened with Okular. Just backup this folder and carry to your new machine and paste it there in the same place. Your annotations are preserved!\n\nA: Since KDE 4.2, Okular has the \"document archiving\" feature. This is an Okular-specific format for carrying the document plus various metadata related to it (currently only annotations). You can save a \"document archive\" from the open document by choosing File → Export As → Document Archive. To open an Okular document archive, just open it with Okular as it would be e.g. a PDF document.\nSince Okular 0.15 you can also save annotations directly into PDF files. This feature is only available if Okular has been built with version 0.20 or later of the Poppler rendering library. You can use File → Save As... to save the copy of the PDF file with annotations.\nread here: https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kdegraphics/okular/annotations.html\n", "Q: Cannot open terminal I'm new to ubuntu and took many days trying to solve a problem I'm having.\nI searched the Internet and I have not found anything concrete that can fix it so this is my problem:\nWhen I try to open the terminal, it is closed immediately and does not show me anything.

Then type sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop at a terminal when you've booted in!

The language indicator changes if I switch by clicking it on the panel, but input is still in English.\nHow to troubleshoot the problem?\n\nMORE INFO: Ubuntu Studio 15.04 uses Xfce 4.12 Desktop Environment. I was told to disable IBus, because it looks like it doesn't support modifier-only shortcuts like Alt+Shift (https://github.com/ibus/ibus/issues/1821). So I disabled IBus. In Xfce it is done through Settings -> Personal -> Language Support:\n\nHowever, I couldn't find Text Entry menu shown in @cl-netbox answer in Xfce. Only Keyboard Input Methods which proposes to launch IBus Daemon and exits if you don't agree:\n\nSo I am stuck with no way to use Russian language on my Ubuntu Studio. Does anybody know how to fix that?\n\nA: I need to give credits to @cl-netbox and @Cbhihe for helping me to find the right way. So after disabling IBus language switching thing stopped to work at all, and Settings -> Other -> Keyboard Input Methods menu provided a wrong way to search for layout switching.\nThe proper place to configure layout with disabled IBus appeared to be in Settings -> Hardware -> Keyboard -> Layout:\n\nAfter opening the window and switching to Layout tab I had to turn off \"Use system defaults\" flag and then configure the window:\n\nThe list was empty, and adding Russian fixed it. The trick was to select the category to get all keys right, and not one of its children:\n\nNow I can also use Alt+Shift shortcut. The only missing part is language indicator on the panel, which is a subject of another question.\n", "Q: How to comment multiple images at once On Windows I had that nice bar on the bottom with the exif entries that I can't manage to make appear on Ubuntu (I'm on Lubuntu but I've tried Mate and Plasma 5.4 too).\nI've tried with exiftool: exiftool -Comment='my comment' <directory> but once I check with gThumb, under Comment > Description there's nothing written. How can I batch comment a bunch of pictures?\n\nA: This is an example of ExifTool FAQ #3.  On a test photo, edit the description in gThumb with something unique, then use the command exiftool -a -G1 -s FILE to see what is the actual tag that is being edited.\nI did some quick searches to try and see what metadata gThumb is actually editing but it was of little value.  I would suggest checking the Caption-Abstract, Description, and ImageDescription tags as those are the most likely tags that gThumb is reading for the Comment > Description.\nedit: Found info that gThumb can read EXIF, IPTC, and XMP metadata, so it might be reading any or all of the above three tags I mentioned for its Description entry.  I'd suggest trying exiftool -Description='my comment' <directory> as your command.\nedit 2:  I found this post on the ExifTool forums that indicates that when writing, gThumb is probably using both Description and Caption-Abstract.  Description is part of the more modern XMP standard, so I suggest using the command in my first edit, though using Caption-Abstract is also an option.\n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows 10 overwrite boot access to Ubuntu So after reading a lot of blogs and forums I have been able to create a new partition and install Windows 10 on my Ubuntu PC. I had to install Windows 10 because I go back to school.\nThe Ubuntu version I use is 15.04\nWindows 10 works fine and I also have not lost any data on my Ubuntu partition.\nAfter the installation of Windows 10 the computer also automatically booted Windows 10 and I did not get a prompt for which OS would like to use.\nUsing a live-usb I recreated Grub and now I am able to boot into Ubuntu, but I still do not get a prompt for what OS I want to boot.\nCould someone tell me what I can do, so I get a prompt for what OS to use when starting the computer?\n\nA: I have been able to create a dual boot with Ubuntu 15.04 and Windows 10.\nIt takes some effort but it is doable. I will also have to say I am not an expert so there might be some things missing or I might have used some wrong terminology. If you have any remarks that can add to this answer please feel free to do so.\nThis is an explanation of how to install Windows 10 after Ubuntu 15.04 has been installed.\nMake a backup of all your data\nI did not lose any information but it is better to be safe then sorry.\nCreate bootable flash drives\nUbuntu\nI already had a bootable flash drive with Ubuntu 15.04.\nIf you still need to do this you can find more info here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\nWindows\nTo create a bootable flash drive with Windows 10 it takes a bit more effort.\nFirst you will need to download a Windows 10 ISO file. Next you have to mount the ISO file (I used Furious ISO Mount) and copy all the files to the flash drive.\nMAKE SURE THE FLASH DRIVE IS FORMATTED AS NFTS. For this you can use gparted.\nSet the correct boot sequence in the bios\nThis is different for every pc. When you are not sure how to get into the bios: just Google: bios boot sequence computer brand or type. You will surely find a forum or a manual that will explain it for your particular system.\nOn a HP Pavilion this is Esc. :)\nBoot the Ubunu 15.04 flash drive\nOnce booted you can use trial, you do not have to install. We will run Ubuntu from the flash drive. Now the real fun begins. I hope you have done the first step and made a backup. If you did not and you are not sure what you are doing, go back and make a backup.\nCreate a new partition for Windows 10\nYou can use gparted to divide your harddrive into multiple partitions.\nRight-click on your harddrive and click Resize/move and set the new size for your Ubuntu partition. The rest will go into the new partition you can use for Windows 10.\nHow you divide the harddisk space is all up to you but keep in mind that windows will take a lot more space than Ubuntu.\nThe shrinking of the Ubuntu partition might take a while so it is time to get a cup of coffee.\nFormat\nRight-click on the new partition and this time select Format to NFTS.\nSet flag\nRight-click one more time on the new partition and set the flag to boot.\nSet label\nThis is not mandatory but if you like to keep this organised it is nice to give your partitions a name. Right click on each partition you would like to rename and set the label.\nNow you are all set and done to install Windows 10.\nInstall Windows 10#\nTurn off the computer, remove the Ubuntu flash drive and insert the Windows_10 bootable flash drive. Run the installation process. Be sure you install it on the right partition. (Are you still sure you didn't need that backup?)\nReinstall Grub\nAfter installing Windows you will notice that the computer automatically boots into Windows 10. But we wanted to have dual boot. For this we will need to do one more step. We will have to reinstall Grub.\nI have found a great link that helped me to do this:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/reinstall-ubuntu-grub-bootloader-after-windows-wipes-it-out/\nNow you should be all set and done with your brand new Ubuntu 15.04 and Windows Dual boot machine. Awesome.\nFrom this point I would like to thank everyone that helped me to figure this out.\n\nA: Have you tried Boot-Repair? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nI recovered Grub many times Windows 7 dualboot with Boot-Repair. I believe it can also auto detect Windows 10 and set your Grub accordingly.\n\nA: Since Windows boot manager is unable to recognize the presence of  any other OS so the ideal solution is to install windows first and then install Ubuntu. In this way Ubuntu boot manager becomes the default boot manager. Since Ubuntu boot manager recognizes the presence of windows OS it will everytime prompt whether to boot Ubuntu or Windows.\n", "Q: Keep old kernels I am doing experiments with few Linux kernels, also I want to keep all the kernels on my system; I don't want then to be removed automatically. how do I achieve that?\n(NOTE: I have mounted /boot on separate 4GB partition so space is not an issue)\n\nA: Update: New releases like Jammy is using /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove\nThis answer was for some old releases which uses /etc/kernel/postinst.d/apt-auto-removal to generate /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove-kernels.\nSo you can create new file APT configuration file same way, kind of an override.\nsudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove-kernels-stop\n\ncontains:\nAPT::NeverAutoRemove\n{\n   \"^linux-image-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-headers-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-image-extra-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-signed-image-*-generic$\";\n   \"^.*-kernel-*-generic$\";\n   \"^linux-tools-*-generic$\";\n};\n\n", "Q: how to make a BASH script to find all php.ini files in dir tree and append text to them My hosting company advertises a php max upload size that can go up to 60M but, It defaults to 2M and I am not able to make changes to the htaccess file.\nI can override the default by changing the php.ini files but this must be done for every php.ini file in the directory tree.\nWhat I and a lot of users need and are begging for, is a BASH script that will do the following task;\n\n\n*\n\n*recursively find the php.ini files \n\n*scan the file for two lines of text        (new php directives)\n\n*if it doesn't have those two lines of text, append the two lines of text.

I don't have this issue with the guest profile though. None of my short-cuts work on it, they're usually Ctrl  F11or Ctrl F12 . \n    Thank you cbhihe, I found out from the information you've given me is that my sound system is not recognizing my speakers as an output, but for some reason I can still manually control the sound using ALSA.\nRan the groups command and got the following;\n(myIDhere) adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare\nI ran the command suggested, sudo adduser id -un audio(with my ID) and got; \nThe user IDHere' is already a member ofaudio'.\nI've been using alsa to change my sound manually but my shortcuts still aren't working.\n\nA: Something maybe broken in your pulseaudio package install (assuming you use PulseAudio ... and since that package has a huge number of reverse dependencies, better than removing and installing it again (1), did you try (from terminal - CTRL+ALT+T):\n$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall pulseaudio\n\nSee if that solves yr pbm. To go a little beyond the scope of yr question, but respecting the spirit of it, check out this, the PulseAudio equalizer, available for 14.04, I find particularly useful in relation to sound control. I think (from the sound of yr user name - pun intended) that it might prove useful to a gamer.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. I am not sure if the solution applies to you but at least it is very easy to check it out. \nIn my case, for some reason I was not in the \"audio\" group. To check it out, you simply execute the \"groups\" command and it will print out all the groups you are in. \nIf the \"audio\" group is printed out that means that you are added in the \"audio\" group so that wasn't your problem after all and this solution doesn't apply to you.\nIf the \"audio\" group is not printed  out that means that you are not added in the \"audio\" group and you need to do it manually. For that, you simply enter this command:\nsudo adduser `id -un` audio\n\nThe \"id -un\" is simply your name. You can equally run \"sudo adduser yourname audio\"\n", "Q: Changed the UEFI motherboard on a dell laptop, now it says no OS detected My laptop was running the latest Ubuntu, because of a minor issue, the motherboard was replaced.

My system was running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server when this strange issue occurred due to a possible power loss with the Intel® Server Board S2600WF. I tried to solve it with a live Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, but it did not have the command efibootmgr or internet connectivity, so I couldn't install the software.

I understand that as apt-get changelog <package> gets its changelogs from changelog.ubuntu.com, running this command does not work to get the changelog for a package in a PPA, and the only real way that I have found is to apt-get source <package> and then look in debian/changelog. Is there a more efficient way of viewing the changelog of a package that is in a PPA in Terminal?\n\nA: The last changes to a PPA package can bee seen at\nhttps://launchpad.net/~<ppa_user_name>/+archive/ubuntu/<PPA_name>/+files/<package_name>_<package_version>_source.changes\n\nYou can write a simple script that will extract this data.\nThe script can be like this\n#!/bin/sh\n\nwget -q -O - https://launchpad.net/~$1/+archive/ubuntu/$2/+files/$3_$4_source.changes | \\\nawk '/Changes:/{f=1;next}/Checksums/{f=0}flag'\n\nRun it this way:\n./changelog.sh <ppa_user_name> <ppa_name> <package_name> <package_version>\n\ne.g.\n./changelog.sh hanipouspilot rtlwifi rtlwifi-new-dkms 0.5\n\nIf you need a full changelog, not only the last entry, then you have to download and extract source.

The upgrade went fine, but sadly, it is no longer much of a file server.  Samba will no longer allow Windows machines to browse the list of shares and only users with an account on the server itself can connect (and THAT requires them to enter their username/password).\nUnder 13.04 all of our shares were public and did not require users to enter any credentials.  Browsing the list of shares worked great.\nI've been trying to poke at the smb.conf file to get it to work with no success.

It doesn't appear to have affected firefox since I can open a new window in firefox without having istartsurf as a hompage. I will however reinstall ubuntu on my laptop again but my question is; Have anyone encountered this problem before and does anyone know how I could have gotten the malware?

Sound is not muted in totem and in fact is pushed up to the fullest. Opening the same sound file in audacity and playing it there works. There doesn't seem to be any place in totem where I could have misconfigured something. \nWhat could be wrong?\nEDIT:\nThe problem is apparently not related to audio file type. All the following files can be played from within audacity for example and are mute in totem:\n$ file test*\ntest.aac: MPEG ADTS, AAC, v4 LC, 44.1 kHz, stereo\ntest.mp3: Audio file with ID3 version 2.2.0, contains: MPEG ADTS, layer III, v2,  80 kbps, 24 kHz, Monaural\ntest.mpg: MPEG sequence, v1, system multiplex\ntest.wma: Microsoft ASF\n\n\nA: There are two separate locations where an individual application's volume can be controlled, and if either is muted, no sound will be played.  You say that the volume in Totem is set to maximum, but there is another place where it can be controlled.  If you check Sound Settings, you'll notice that the rightmost tab is labelled 'Applications'.  In the case that Totem is shown muted in this control, it is still possible to independently adjust the volume within the application, but you will not get sound output.\nThis image shows Totem with the volume up, playing a song.  The visualisation is going, and you would expect to hear sound.\n\nThis image shows the Sound Settings with the computer volume on, but the application volume for Totem (Videos) off.  Even though inspection of the volume from within Totem would suggest that the music should be playing, nothing gets to the speaker because of the mute control here.  Note that Totem has to actually be running, or a volume control for it won't be visible.\n\n\nA: Install the \"pavucontrol\" app, and use it to see the output levels from Totem, then you can reset the output device for Totem to the correct one.  Once this is done it should be persistent.\n\nA: For some reason Totem was outputting though an hdmi port even though the system output device was the main speaker, switching the output to the hdmi and back made totem output to the correct place again.\n\nA: first of all uninstall totem and excute sudo apt-get install -f\nthen reinstall totem\nor try  This it will works for you\nCheers \n", "Q: Modification of US-Internation keyboard layout I have such question: how can i modify US-International keyboard layout?\nBy default to get this symbols: `~´¨ i need to press it twice or with AltGr Right Alt\nWith this answer  I edited  /usr/share/X11/symbols/us \npartial alphanumeric_keys\nxkb_symbols \"intl\" {\n\nname[Group1]= \"English (US, UNIm95 edit international with dead keys)\";\n\ninclude \"us(basic)\"\n\n//Here only edited lines left\n// Was\nkey <TLDE> { [dead_grave, dead_tilde,         grave,       asciitilde ] };\n//Now\nkey <TLDE> { [     grave, asciitilde,    dead_grave,      dead_tilde  ] };\n\n\n// Was\nkey <AE06> { [    6, dead_circumflex,    onequarter,      asciicircum ] };\n// Now\nkey <AE06> { [        6, asciicircum,    onequarter, dead_circumflex  ] };   \n\n// Was \nkey <AC11> { [dead_acute, dead_diaeresis, apostrophe,        quotedbl ] };\n// Now\nkey <AC11> { [apostrophe,   quotedbl,    dead_acute,   dead_diaeresis ] };\n\nBut it still works with double pressing.

I read here that it is essential to have Secure Boot enabled:\n\nHowever I find that when I enable Secure Boot, it changes it so that systems can boot with UEFI boot, but not Legacy, it also disables CMS. However, when I then try to boot my system, I get 3 different start things that I can boot from:\n- ATAPI CD1: PLDS DVD-RW DS8A8SH\n- ATA HDD0: TOSHIBA MK5065GSX\n> PCI LAN\n    - LAN(3C970E7102F6) -IPv4\n    - LAN(3C970E7102F6) -IPv6\n\nBut no matter which of them I choose, I just get back to that screen and cannot boot, then the only way is to go to the other tab and select Setup, go back into BIOS, and disable Secure Boot, and then say that both Legacy and UEFI are supported in the Setup options (as just disabling Secure Boot does not work).\nSo I am assuming that my current and only OS, Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 (64-bit), does not support UEFI boot, and only Legacy. So is there anything that I can do about this so that I can enable Secure Boot? And why does it only support Legacy anyway? And just as a quick note, this didn't work when I had Windows 7 (a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away...) either.\n\nA: Boot loaders are written for the computer's firmware. This is analogous to software, which is written for a particular OS. Thus, you don't \"convert... the bootloader to UEFI\"; that would be like \"converting the mail client to Windows\" or \"converting the photo editor to Linux.\" Instead, you install a new program for the desired environment. In some cases, the new program may have the same name as the old one (as in Thunderbird or GIMP, which are available for both Windows and Linux; or GRUB 2, which is available for both BIOS and EFI). In other cases, there are OS- or firmware-specific programs, such as efibootmgr (a Linux-specific tool) or rEFInd (an EFI-specific boot manager).\nIf your computer is currently booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, then to boot in EFI mode, you must do several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert the disk from the Master Boot Record (MBR) to the GUID Partition Table (GPT). This step may not be strictly required, but some EFIs can be fussy, and using MBR may require installing your boot loader to the fallback filename (EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi), which most tools won't do by default. Thus, an MBR-to-GPT conversion is desirable. This can be done fairly painlessly with my gdisk program (which is installed in Ubuntu by default), as described here.\n\n*Create an EFI System Partition (ESP). This is a partition where EFI boot loaders reside. It has no exact equivalent in BIOS. You'll probably have to use GParted to resize at least one partition to make room for the ESP. I recommend making it 550MiB in size. Although an ESP is usually the first or second partition on a disk, the realities of partition resizing mean that it may work better to make it the last partition on the disk if you're converting from BIOS/MBR to EFI/GPT.\n\n*Install an EFI boot loader. GRUB 2 is the traditional boot loader, and it can be installed fairly automatically by booting an Ubuntu live CD in EFI mode and running Boot Repair. Boot Repair should also set things up to work with Secure Boot. Most other boot loaders will require jumping through some extra hoops to work with Secure Boot, although sometimes this isn't too bad -- if it detects Shim (the most common Linux tool for supporting Secure Boot), my own rEFInd will set itself up to use Secure Boot.\n\n*Reboot and hope it all works. Any number of things can go wrong with all this. If you have problems, your best bet is to search here and elsewhere for a solution, and if you don't find one, post a new question here or on some other forum.\n\n\nNote that in a Linux installation, the only truly critical software difference between a BIOS-mode and an EFI-mode installation is the boot loader. Thus, switching from BIOS-mode to EFI-mode booting doesn't require additional software changes. (In practice, installing an EFI-mode GRUB is likely to pull in some other related packages, like efibootmgr. These are indeed helpful, but not critical for booting.) There are no changes to the kernel, C libraries, shells, GUI, or other core tools required under EFI compared to BIOS. As I've written above, partitioning will need to be adjusted, but that doesn't require any software changes. Secure Boot requires Shim, PreLoader, or special custom setups; and depending on the boot loader, a signed kernel may be required.\nAs you might gather from this, Ubuntu should work fine with Secure Boot. (There are occasional exceptions because of finicky EFIs, though. Also, using Secure Boot makes it easier to misconfigure something so that it breaks.) When doing a fresh install with Secure Boot active, it should all be pretty transparent. When you do a conversion from an existing BIOS-mode installation, you're more likely to run into problems, since conversion tools don't really exist (unless you count Boot Repair, which does only part of the job). Thus, you'll end up doing more manually, which means there's more room to miss a step or make a mistake.\nFor more information on Linux and Secure Boot, read my main Web page on the subject, which covers basic principles and typical configurations. If you want to go really hard-core with a custom Secure Boot configuration, read my page on taking complete control of Secure Boot. This describes how to configure the system to boot with Secure Boot active but without Shim or PreLoader, and in a way that enables you to lock Microsoft tools out, if you so desire.\n\nA: Secure Boot is a useful feature to lock down a computer to only run certified software. This helps to prevent booting hardware with malicious or uncertified code.\nFrom Microsoft Technet:\n\nSecure Boot helps to make sure that your PC boots using only firmware that is trusted by the manufacturer.\n\nThis means the Ubuntu firmware needs to be certified to be able to boot on a Secure Boot enabled UEFI system. If we do not want this we need to disable this \"feature\":\n\nYou may need to disable Secure Boot to run some PC graphics cards, hardware, or operating systems such as Linux or previous version of Windows.\n\nSo Microsoft recommends disabling Secure Boot for Linux or other non-certified hard- or software. A manufacturer may implement disabling Secure Boot but this in no way mandatory for a Windows system.\n\nFor most PCs, you can disable Secure Boot through the PC’s firmware (BIOS) menus. For logo-certified Windows RT 8.1 and Windows RT PCs, Secure Boot is required to be configured so that it cannot be disabled.\n\nOn these systems we may not be able to disable Secure Boot.\nAt present we can create our own certificate to be able to boot but this may change any time in the future when the Windows 10 Device Guard Certification process becomes more restrictive.\nSo the implementation of disabling Secure Boot on your machine may be incomplete, or restrictive in a way that it does not accept a non-Microsoft certificate.\n", "Q: Ralink RT3090 wifi hard-blocked on IdeaPad S205 I am trying to install Ubuntu 14.04.3 on someone's IdeaPad S205.

Hardware overheating is a safety hazard and, if that heat is going into your body, it's known to be a cause towards cancer.\nYour only bet if you really want to AVOID the proprietary driver would be to disassemble the generic linux driver and the proprietary driver and merge the parts of the proprietary driver that are in charge of the fans. In other words, if you're good with scripting, you can try that, but I do not condone it at all. It's a mere suggested alternative, but should you make a minor flaw in the scripting or if the new lines of code are incompatible, you could have a literal bomb on your lap... or you could burn out the fans.\nI highly recommend the proprietary driver over all other things. It's written by the manufacturer and is proven to be the best thing for you to use otherwise, why would the manufacturer offer it? They know the heat is a flaw that linux cannot fix on their own, so they fixed it in their driver.\nI hope this post was helpful, but if not, please tell us why you are adamantly against the proprietary driver.\nCheers.\n", "Q: Cannot boot into Ubuntu [Dual-boot] Hi I have installed Ubuntu onto my 2nd hard drive. During the Ubuntu installation I chose \"something else\" and selected the unallocated partition I created specifically for Ubuntu. I did not choose the \"install alongside windows 8.1\" option because my current windows os is running on my SSD. I want Ubuntu to be installed on my secondary HDD.\nI am almost 100% I have it installed correctly. I just cannot figure out for the life of me how I would go about booting into the OS. I do not get any sort of boot manager.\nI have looked to add a boot option in my BIOS but there were no options for the installed Ubuntu.\nAny sort of tips or feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: When the Computer starts, after loading the BIOS, it boots from a Operating System Source which can be Hard drive ,USB drive, Ethernet or DVD/Floppy Drive. The order in which these source should be checked if there is any Operating System installed on them or not, can be changed from Boot Order in BIOS settings.\nIf you have two Operating Systems on one Hard Drive and you wish to select which one to use every time you turn on your computer,that's where Boot Manager comes into action. Boot Manager identifies all the installed O.S. on the Hard Drive (or some other source like USB, DVD etc. for that matter) and gives the user choice to choose one.\nHere, since you have two Hard Drives (one SSD and other HDD), you actually have two sources to boot from and hence there is no role for Boot Manager. So if you want to choose a particular Hard Drive each time your computer starts, you have select from Boot Device Options each time (either by pressing Esc or F12 or something else depending on your computer). \nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Recovering Lost Data I was just wondering if you have any information on getting my data back on corrupted micro sd card. I have tried ideas off Youtube but they did not work. Thank you\n\nA: If you have a USB sd card reader, try using that to mount the card instead of through the device that the card belongs to (like instead of plugging the cable into your phone/ camera from your computer). This just makes sure there really is a problem with the card and not with your device.\nThe second benefit of using a USB adapter is that you can touch the card to see if it is hot. If the card is burning up then you have a short and there is no way to recover any data- this usually happens if you accidentally bent the card slightly or if there has been physical damage to the card. How hot is too hot? It will almost burn your fingers... \nThe circuitry is really fragile in these cards so it doesn't take much to fry them. I have never had any luck with recovery software. Hard lesson learned - never keep anything valuable on SD flash- it is by far the least reliable storage medium. \n", "Q: How to switch to discrete graphics with Ubuntu 14.04 I'm having trouble switching to the discrete graphics on Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nFirst about my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Model: HP Pavilion dv6\n\n*CPU: Intel Core i7-2670QM CPU @ 2.20GHz\n\n*Memory: 6GB\n\n*Graphics card: Radeon HD 6400M/7400M series (could not find out the exact model)\n\n*OS: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\n\n\n\nWhat I tried:\n(At first I shut down the X-server with stop lightdm.)\nI originally tried to switch to my Radeon graphics card instead of the integrated unit.\nMy graphics devices are:\n>>> lspci -vnn | grep '\\''[030[02]\\]'\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0116] (rev 09) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Seymour [Radeon HD 6400M/7400M Series] [1002:6760] (rev ff) (prog-if ff)\n\nI tried switching devices using /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch (following this article: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics ). I obtained:\n>>> cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n0:IGD:+:Pwr:0000:00:02.0\n1:DIS: :DynOff:0000:01:00.0\n\nbut echo ON > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch didn't change anything so I went to BIOS and changed Switchable Graphics Mode to Fixed (following http://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c02948560 ) and because there was still no change I added radeon.runpm=0 to /etc/default/grub at GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= (following http://iswwwup.com/t/3a156248c627/ati-vgaswitcheroo-doesnt-work-on-14-04-discrete-radeon-always-on-dell-vost.html ).\nAfter rebooting I obtained:\n>>> cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n0:IGD:+:Pwr:0000:00:02.0\n1:DIS: :Pwr:0000:01:00.0\n\necho DIS > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch now caused the screen to turn black and didn't show any ouput. However I was able to check the content of /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch by copying it to a file and then switching back to integrated graphics. The content was:\n>>> cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n0:IGD: :Off:0000:00:02.0\n1:DIS:+:Pwr:0000:01:00.0\n\nSo apparently the Radeon card was powered and active but didn't output anything. I observed the same behaviour when having an external screen connected both via VGA and HDMI.\n(Side note: switching back to integrated graphics via echo IGD > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch gave as output [  956.727633] [drm:rv770_stop_dpm] *ERROR* Could not force DPM to low. (probably due to the radeon.runpm=0 which I added before); however the /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch wasn't available anymore (I couldn't issue any further commands) and lspci -vnn | grep '\\''[030[02]\\]' didn't list the Radeon anymore.)\nSo I thought the problem might be a missing driver.\n\nAbout the AMD driver:\nI checked the AMD website for an Ubuntu driver and found the following: http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Linux+x86\nI followed the installation manual (http://www2.ati.com/drivers/amd-catalyst-graphics-driver-installer-notes-for-linux-operating-systems.pdf ; none of fglrx, fglrx-core, fglrx-amdcccle, fglrx-dev was already installed) but encountered an error when installing fglrx-core: there was a conflict with libopencl1. I followed this workaround: 14.10 wine and fglrx conflict and modified Conflicts and Provides as described, then the installation of the above packages finished without error. Also, as described in the workaround, I did apt-get install fglrx-updates. However after rebooting the system told me \n\nThe system is running in low-graphics mode - Your screen, graphics\n  card, and input device settings could not be detected correctly. You\n  will need to configure there yourself.\n\nI used the console log-in to remove the previously installed packages but the graphics still don't work.\n\nTo summarize the question:\nWhat do I have to do in order to manually switch to the Radeon graphics card using Ubuntu 14.04? In case I need to install the above mentioned driver is the conflict with libopencl1 a problem and if so how I can work around this? Also, how can I get the X-server back working?\nThanks a lot in advance! Cheers!\nEDIT:\nI uploaded /var/log/Xorg.0.log and /var/log/Xorg.failsafe.log.

Once they have logged in on HostA their credentials are stored and they can login to HostB (HostC .etc) without a prompt.\nPersonally I like ssh using ssh-agent to store my credentials and then I can login all over the network without bother.  But that requires using .ssh/authorized_keys, which you stated you didn't want to do.

However, it was nigh impossible to diagnose that issue when the network connection is unreliable.\nThe above problem started probably earlier than last weekend, but I had other things to occupy my attention and did not focus too closely. I was taking a bit of a vacation at home to do things around the apartment, and yet I mostly just watched videos.. until the connection got choppy.\nFrustrated, I messed around on my router, an Asus RT-N66U with Tomato 1.28 USB. I use the 2.4 GHz channel 4, with WPA2, and do not broadcast the SSID. As part of my attempts, I did enable the 5 GHz band, but that did not resolve the problem, since it appears that my laptop refuses to play in that band. It is now disabled, but the issue remains.\nThe laptop in use, an Asus X501A, first exhibited the symptoms on Ubuntu 14.10 running Firefox 37 with NoScript. I imagined that upgrading to 15.04 with Firefox 39 in tow might fix the problem. Alas, it did not.\nI also sometimes bring my work laptop, an Asus GWV55, if I am not mistaken, home to work (or play simple games), and that runs Windows 7 Professional SP1 and nearly all latest updates. I do not recall having any connection issues while playing games prior to last weekend, but I did not make use of the work laptop much during the time I observed the connection drops on the personal laptop. Therefore, please keep in mind that it is possible that the router configuration was not put back to the exact same state it was prior to the issues observed, however, I have not done much to alter the configuration.\nAlso note that the laptops and the router are on virtually the opposing corners of my one floor apartment, but it is a two story apartment building. When connected, the \"bars\" are usually 80% or higher, so I do not think signal strength is a major factor. That being stated, it IS an apartment building, and I do notice higher lag towards middle evening hours. That is lag though, and even when it was really bad, I used to not lose the connection.\nAs part of my attempts to fix this issue from the router side, based on research here and other locations, I have ensured that I am only using WPA2 and not mixed WPA/WPA2, WMM is disabled, and I also bumped the router transmit power from 42 mW to 60 mW. The number of leases total available is 8 across all interfaces, wireless or not (an old configuration setting), with 1 day lease times. I have yet to see more that 4 active or expiring leases the entire time I have owned the router, and all are devices under my direct control.\nBy the way, I am writing this from my phone, because the connection would not resume. It just will not reconnect, or if it did, 5 minutes would be were I would put the time interval in which I would anticipate the connection would get dropped again.\n\nA: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2244010\nTurns out WMM was turned off in the router. I know that was one of the settings I disabled, not thinking I'd ever need it. Apparently, 'nix platforms actually require it to be set, while Windows 7 and Android 4.4.4 do not. According to the link, neither does Apple OS X.\nThis was an annoying situation to go through, since the other devices that I have access to for debugging all worked and thus made me think it was the Ubuntu platform, when instead it was me messing around with my router. Such an unforgiving platform sometimes.\nI like it.\n", "Q: How to split the lines in a text file into two consecutive lines in a new file?

The consecutive lines are:\npath/filename/ext:ln#\ncontents of the line itself\n\nI could write a program to do it, but I wondered it there was alteadu a command that would do this?\n\nA: Your question and my understanding of it\nYour question currently lacks concrete examples of input and desired output, hence I will try to answer your answer as I understand it, and edit accordingly when you provide more info.\nThe way I understand your question right now is that you are running something along the following lines:\nfind /path/to/directory  -exec grep -H -n 'SomeString' {} \\;\nWhich produces a result that is something like this:\n$ find /home/$USER/fortesting -type f -exec grep -H -n 'HelloWorld' {} \\;              \n/home/serg/fortesting/file3:1:HelloWorld\n/home/serg/fortesting/file1:4:HelloWorld\n\nOr in general /path/to/file:lineNumber:String\nPossible solutions\nAppropriately enough,this is a job for awk: you have 3 fields separated by colon (field separator), which translates into awk code awk -F\":\" '{printf $1 FS $2 FS \"\\n\" $3 \"\\n\" }' Thus we can do the following:\n$ find /home/$USER/fortesting -type f -exec grep -H -n 'HelloWorld' {} \\; | awk -F \":\" '{printf $1 FS $2 FS \"\\n\" $3 \"\\n\" }'       \n/home/xieerqi/fortesting/file3:1:\nHelloWorld\n/home/xieerqi/fortesting/file1:4:\nHelloWorld\n\nNow, awk is a versatile tool; we can mimick the output of find -exec grep with `find -exec awk '(awk code here)' , which will already will be processed, and saves on piping. \nConsider the code bellow :\n$ find $PWD -type f -exec awk  '/HelloWorld/ {print FILENAME\":\"FNR\"\\n\"$0 }' {} \\;                                                  \n/home/xieerqi/fortesting/file3:1\nHelloWorld\n/home/xieerqi/fortesting/file1:4\nHelloWorld\n\nLess piping and the contents are being processed as they are found.In addition, if the file has colon in its name, this code will still process it correctly, since we are not depending on field separators, but rather printing variable FILENAME followed by colon, followed by FNR (the input record number in the current input file), and the found line separated by newline.\nEfficiency\nNow, lets consider efficiency as the number of files goes large.\nFirst, I create files file1 to file1000, and then we use /usr/bin/time to test each version of command.\n$ echo 'HelloWorld' | tee file{$(seq -s',' 1 1000)}\n$ /usr/bin/time find /home/$USER/fortesting -type f -exec grep -H -n 'HelloWorld' {} \\; | awk -F \":\" '{printf $1 FS $2 FS \"\\n\" $3 \"\\n\" }'  > /dev/null\n0.04user 0.34system 0:03.09elapsed 12%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 2420maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+113358minor)pagefaults 0swaps\n\n$ /usr/bin/time find $PWD -type f -exec awk  '/HelloWorld/ {print FILENAME\":\"FNR\"\\n\"$0 }' {} \\; > /dev/null                        \n0.82user 2.03system 0:04.25elapsed 67%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 2856maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+145292minor)pagefaults 0swaps\n\nSo the lengthy version seems to be more efficient, takes less time and CPU percentage. \nNow, here is a compromise - change \\; to + :\n/usr/bin/time find $PWD -type f -exec awk  '/HelloWorld/ {print FILENAME\":\"NR\"\\n\"$0 }' {} +\nWhat does the + operator do ? The big difference is that + tells exec to list as many files as input to awk command as possible, while \\; makes awk be called each and every time for each and every single found file. \n$ /usr/bin/time find $PWD -type f -exec awk  '/HelloWorld/ {print FILENAME\":\"FNR\"\\n\"$0 }' {} + > /dev/null                         \n0.00user 0.02system 0:00.02elapsed 74%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 3036maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+398minor)pagefaults 0swaps\n\nHey, much faster, right ? Though still heavy on CPU. \nOutputting to another file\nAs for outputting to another file , add use > operator for redirection\n\nA: sed readily does that:\n$ echo 'path/filename.ext:ln#:line contents' | sed -r 's/([^:]*:[^:]*):/\\1\\n/'\npath/filename.ext:ln#\nline contents\n\nThe regex ([^:]*:[^:]*): looks for the first two colon-separated fields and saves them in group 1.  The replacement text, \\1\\n, places a newline after those two fields.\nImprovement\nIf a file name itself contains a colon, this will, of course, give incorrect results.  As steeldriver suggests, this can be avoided using the -Z option to grep which will put a NUL character, \\x00, instead of a colon after the file name.  For example:\ngrep -ZHn 'regex' * | sed -r 's/\\x00([^:]*):/:\\1\\n/'\n\nOr, if the capabilities of find are required:\nfind . -type f -exec grep -ZHn 'regex' {} + | sed -r 's/\\x00([^:]*):/:\\1\\n/'\n\nThis will work even if colons appear in the file name, or the line matched, or both.\n", "Q: How can I cut the mac address out of DHCPDUMP?

This code is set to run the three commands concurrently, and you're having to work with locks and such to force it to run consecutively.

That is, replace\nscreen -d -m -L -S \"Screen PID for script #1\" ./script1.sh \"$PortStart\"\n\nwith\n./script1.sh \"$PortStart\"\n\nThen get rid of all the lock commands.

However, I did leave Windows 8.1 intact and successfully set up dual-boot instead of deleting it.\nAfter successfully installing Ubuntu I set up wifi and the SD-card reader following this Debian wiki page. In the process I installed the 4.0.5-generic kernel downloaded from the Ubuntu Kernel Team server.\nEverything worked - except sound and bluetooth. Which is okay with me.\nI then upgraded to Ubuntu 15.04 using\nsudo do-release-update\n\nThe update worked, but reported that it failed to install grub-efi-amd64-signed.\nsudo reboot\n\nthen resulted in a freeze at the Ubuntu loading screen. Ctr-Alt-F2 did not work. I pressed the power button to turn off the device and then immediately turned it on again. I selected the 3.19 kernel and Ubuntu booted. Booting after that worked with the 4.0.5 kernel as well.\nNow sudo apt-get upgrade produces\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information...

Can it safely be ignored (32bit grub works just fine)? Or should I remove grub-efi-amd64-signed? Re-install it? And why do I even have it installed - the X205TA only supports 32bit EFI after all.\n\nA: I've been getting this error when installing from scratch. I was attempting to overwrite my old partitions, and let the installer handle it automatically by selecting \"Erase Ubuntu and reinstall\" (at least, I think that's what it said). It would error out at trying to install grub2. I resolved it by selecting \"something else\" on install, and specifying to format my Ubuntu partition. At that point, it worked without a hitch. \nI think this is because the EFI partition gets corrupted in some way. You could try running dosfsck on the EFI partition. At least, that's what this bug report says: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub-installer/+bug/1434871\nI do not know if you can ignore the error. It left my system in an unbootable state, though, so I'd certainly be careful with it. If you are able to boot without a problem, then it's probably just going to cause errors when you try to update until this is repaired.\n", "Q: Need Help Installing Ubuntu.

Can someone describe a method or point me to the direction of the best way to make a usb-bootable version of Ubuntu with more than 4GB of storage?\nNOTE: I am interested in any solutions but preferably this would work cross platform.\n\nA: You can use http://www.linuxliveusb.com/en/home to create a usb bootable with persistent storage.\nCheck the Help to have more than 4Gb : http://www.linuxliveusb.com/en/help/faq/persistence and this link http://www.pendrivelinux.com/create-a-larger-than-4gb-casper-partition/ \n", "Q: How to upgrade from rabbitvcs 0.15 to 0.16?

How do I get the video+audio in mkv format?\n\nA: Your video is encoded as \"MPEG4 Visual\", this is another name for mp42.  Unfortunately, this video was encoded using software that was developed in a time where the MPEG4-2 standard was no yet implemented.\nBy the time it was ready for general use, other codecs had taken its place (namely x264 etc).\nThis means that support for this codec is rudimentary, and struggles at best.\nThat said, you can fix the file somewhat, into a format that ffmpeg will read properly.\nThe part that ffmpeg has difficulty with, is the major_brand : isom part of the metadata.\nTo get around this, we use another tool: MP4Box\nThen, once you have MP4Box installed, you run a command like this:\nMP4Box -brand mp42 input.mp4\n\nThis should change the metadata to read major_brand : mp42\nOnce this has been completed, ffmpeg should recognize it, and be able to convert it properly.\nGood luck! :)\n", "Q: How to set up Gnome interface for HiDPI screen?

It worked for some time, but then instead of the video, only a blank screen was displayed with the audio. Even the same videos that could be played before did not work.\nI tried uninstalling and re-installing, and I upgraded it to the latest.\nI've tried: menu Tool → Preferences → Video → enabling Accelerated video output (Overlay).\nExecution via the terminal also gives the same.\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr).\n\nA: My workaround is to delete the VLC config-file.\nOpen a terminal in ~/.config/vlc and\nrm vlc-qt-interface.conf\n\nWeird thing, if i delete the config file with Nautilus filemanager: still no window.\n\nA: Also, This happend to me, but...\nnavigate to: \n: menu Tool → Preferences → Video \nCheck the output drop-down menu\nand check that you have chosen the appropriate output codec, It was set to \"auto\" in the drop-down and needed to be selected \"X11\"\n\nA: *\n\n*\n*\n\n*Go to Tools→Preferences→Video  \n\n*Remove the tick for Accelerated video output (Overlay)  \n\n*Try and play the movie again, you should now see output.\n\n\n\nOr\n2.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Tools→Preferences->Video  \n\n*Change Output to X11 Video output\nIf the above doesn't work, that particular video might have a proprietary video format that is not supported.\nReference here.\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 and updated to vlc 2.2.7. I had the same problem after updating the update.\nGo to Tools -> Preferences -> Video -> Output and select any of the first three options that end in (XCB). This resolved the issue for me.\njanitor-\n\nYou can also try either of the OpenGL options and they also work.\n\nA: I've noticed this problem for a couple of years now, and have noticed this pattern and work-around:\n\n\n*\n\n*If VLC is minimized when it's called to play a file, the video will fail: it will show as blank/black.\n\n*If VLC is not minimized when it's called to play a file, the video works just fine.\n\n\nThe workaround is to make sure VLC is not minimized when you feed it a file to play.\nHow I found this out: I have a playlist file on the desktop.  I typically press the \"Show Desktop\" button to minimize all windows before I run that playlist file.  If VLC was already opened, it is now minimized.  If I then open the playlist file, the VLC windows will pop back up, but the video will fail.\nHowever, if I make sure to bring VLC back to its windowed state before opening the playlist file, the video works.\n\nA: If the VLC still play without video the problem can be due to the incompatible video codec contained in the files. In this case, maybe need to convert the file to VLC more supported video format. You can choose Makemkv or Pavtube video converter,both powerful video tools.\n\nA: Easy fix and no u don't need to listen to the above. Go into VLC and go to bottom right where the 3 dots are located and go to settings. Then go to video settings and turn off hardware decoding. Problem solved\n\nA: I had the same problem with fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04 and fresh VLC.\nMy video card is NVidia and I was using the binary proprietary driver version 361.42\nI switched to version 340.96 of the same driver and I got the video running without any problems.\nHope I helped.\n\nA: This happened to me when I accidentally deleted libavcodec (probably it was targeted by apt-get autoremove after deleting some other package). In my case no player (I tried vlc, xplayer, smplayer) except browsers were not able to play any video (I tried for mp4, avi, mkv) but the audio worked. Re-installing this package fixed my problem. So check if it's installed.\n\nA: None of these worked for me, but a \"mark for reinstall\" in synaptic did the trick.\n\nA: In my case (Kubuntu 18.10 x64) changing Output to X11 Video output (as Ravan proposed) did not help, but XVideo output (XCB) helped.\nSo...\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Tools→Preferences->Video;\n\n*Change Output to XVideo output (XCB).\n\n\nA: I had the same issue on Ubuntu 22.10 Wayland VLC 3.0.17.4. When I purged the application, it worked exactly one time. When the vlc was launched for the second time, the video remained blank, however any snapshot taken worked.\nIt turned out, deleting the geometry line from ~/.config/vlc/vlc-qt-interface.conf helped.\ngeometry=@ByteArray(\\x1\\xd9\\xd0\\xcb\\0\\x3\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\a\\x7f\\0\\0\\x4\\x37\\0\\0\\x2\\x80\\0\\0\\0@\\0\\0\\a\\x7f\\0\\0\\x2\\xcf\\0\\0\\0\\x1\\x2\\0\\0\\0\\a\\x80\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0%\\0\\0\\a\\x7f\\0\\0\\x4\\x37)\nHowever, it got recreated every vlc launch. I changed the screen size on the blank video window by mouse and re-launched. It works now.\nMay this strange advice help some future visitors of this old issue.\n\nA: Resetting preferences helped me\nTools -> Preferences -> Reset Preferences\n\nA: You can try this too (I did it in Ubuntu 16.04.03)\nuninstall VLC at all, then open terminal window and type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:videolan/master-daily\n\nthen:  \nsudo apt-get update\n\nand then:  \nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nit works for me, so I hope you can get it too.\n", "Q: Replace Windows 10 with Lubuntu Im on a HP Mini 110-3800 with a Intel Atom CPU N455 (1.66 Ghz) and 1 GB RAM.\nSince both Windows 7 Starter as well as the upgraded Windows 10 are both too slow for this netbook, I want to replace Windows 10 with Lubuntu.\nI don't have a CD-Drive, so I used UNetbootin to get the Lubuntu 15.04-desktop-i386 on an USB-Stick.

There are only a few common ones (especially if you're only asking about default MTAs).  You can find the common ones with a google search or list of MTAs like this page.\nThen, knowing what they are, you can look for their running binaries.  If you do a ps -ef, you'll find (as I did, and if you're running 16.04), that postfix, one of the common MTAs is listed numerous times.  So that's your default.  You can google to find out what the binary name is for the other MTAs.\nI know this isn't the most elegant solution, but I haven't found an elegant solution as I've searched, so this solution at least got the job done for me.

So the contents of my .Xmodmap file is now:\n\nkeycode 116 = F18 F18 F18\n\nI have tested with this new keymap and Chrome now seems to be behaving itself, like the other programs.\n\nA: This answer solved it for me:\nsetxkbmap -option lv3:rwin_switch\n\nAnd then run xmodmap again and restart the application.\n\nA: Here's how I solved the same issue, and I'm putting it here for anyone with this problem.\nI got the answer from here.\nFrom the command line:\n    sudo su\n\nNow you have to figure out the scancode of the stuck key.\n    showkey -s\n\nThen press the key and it will give two scancodes: press and release. Write those down. Or, since your key is stuck, look for whichever code is repeating itself. For me, the down key comes in two scancode pairs: 0xe0 0x50 (press) and 0xe0 0xd0 (release). You have to abbreviate the scancode pair and use setkeycodes to remap it to a new keycode:\n    setkeycodes e050 255\n    setkeycodes e0d0 255\n\nThat will disable your down arrow key at the kernel level, which should prevent problems in Chrome. Apparently Chrome handles keyboard input somewhat independently of xmodmap and xkb. This was a deliberate change to accommodate how Chrome handles input in ChromeOS. Fortunately, disabling a stuck key at the kernel level stops the problem long before it reaches Chrome. This worked for me to stop a stuck numberpad 9 key from wreaking havoc.\n", "Q: Why video played by VLC media player are blurred compared to MPV media player?

When I did, I just disconnected my normal monitor and plugged right into my tv. Everything was fine when I did that.\nBut then I reset my computer and all of a sudden all of the text and window borders became super small.\nI've looked around for a fix and although I've seen some posts about it, I couldn't wrap my head around how to fix it.\nCould someone walk me through getting this fixed? I would really like to keep this as my monitor. \n\nA: It looks like you have found at least one of the system fonts settings, but I have found at least 3 on my installation (Lubuntu 14.04).\nFrom the launcher button:\n1. Preferences - Customise Look and Feel, then on the Widget tab there is a default font.\n2. Preferences - Desktop Preferences, then on the Appearance tab there is a label text font.\n3. Preferences - Openbox Configuration Manager, then on the Appearance page there are 6 fonts to set.  \nYou might also want to right-click on the panel (i.e. the bar with the icons, clock, power icon etc.) and select Panel Settings. On the Geometry tab increase the height and icon size.\nUnfortunately I cannot find out how to change the font sizes for audacious and xterminal, but some applications do let you change the font size. I usually use LXTerminal instead of XTerm, and LXTerminal does allow you to change the font size in Edit - Preferences.\nAlso make sure the screen resolution (Preferences - Monitor Settings) is set to a resolution that your screen supports. There is no point in using a resolution higher than what your TV can do. In the specification section towards the rear of the TV manual (Sony do supply TV manuals online if you don't have it. I know this because I have downloaded one for the very same reason. Google the TV make and model number) you should be able to find the highest supported resolution.\nIf you do change the resolution, you may also want to change the resolution of the login screen. You do this by editing the xorg.conf file /etc/X11/xorg.conf. You will need to create this if you don't already have it with the following commands:\n    sudo service lightdm stop\n    sudo Xorg -configure\n    sudo mv xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n    #Edit the xorg.conf file with your editor of choice\n    sudo service lightdm start  \nYou will want to find Section \"Screen\", scroll down to the last \"EndSubSection\" before the \"EndSection\" and insert the line:\nModes     \"1360x768\"\nbefore the \"EndSubSection\" line.\n(You input your desired resolution instead of \"1360x768\" if it is different)\nAnother option to make everything readable is that you set your resolution very low, but this would defeat the purpose of the HD in your TV. However, it may make things easier temporarily while you try to read menu options.\n", "Q: Controlling mouse scroll with keyboard Using xkb I've managed to control mouse buttons with the keyboard.

When i searched on Google about error the forums explained something about bad characters, and last time i noticed when i opened Firefox on one website where it was some strange characters instead of arrows characters left and right.\nEDIT #2:\nNow even Thunderbird is crashing after some time. I reinstalled Nvidia drivers and even installed different version.\nBut the one thing that i tried is logout of my account and than login on Guest account and on Guest account Firefox is working, it started normally and i surfed a while and everything is ok.

The author of FreshPlayer says that config line doesn't do anything anyhow.\nI tried it and Firefox and FreshPlayer were both back to working normally again.\nThanks for your help, Alesksandar.  I would never have fixed this on my own.\n\nA: Open a terminal and type firefox --help for some insight.  \nAmong the text shown by that you will see:\n--safe-mode        Disables extensions and themes for this session.\n\nSo, this might be some help to get further:\nfirefox --safe-mode \n... I'd expect it to display an option to reset the settings/plugins\n(you should not lose links or bookmarks by this).\n\nA: Alright looks like i found the problem, the problem was with flash player plugin. For some reason looks like update of flash player is causing Mozilla (not only Firefox, Thunderbird too) to crash. After i deleted /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins folder, Firefox started, i copied back my bookmarks and history and everything is back to normal. Looks like videos with html5 player are working but flash not. \nEDIT:\nAs i checked further in my backups, i had installed Pepper Flash plugin previously, so that's what it was causing the problem. I have removed it and now it works. Although apps that require newer flash player don't work now.\n\nA: Thank you! After having worked most of 24h incl. half of the night desparately, because I needed to set up a spare PC with, guess what, firefox and thunderbird for banking, news and e-mails, deleting the plugins directory at /usr/lib/mozilla was the solution (I strongly advice, however, not to delete, but to  rename it (something like mv ./plugins ./plugins-dangerous - not tried to enter this actually, see last paragraph, as I re-installed xubuntu 16.04 later - )). Had tried xubuntu and ubuntu 16.04, and then ubuntu 14.04. Firefox 45 and 50 as well as thunderbird did run perfectly from live DVD, any ubuntu version, but never after (clean and new) installation on HDD.  \nIt had not helped at all to start firefox with firefox --safe-mode!\nEdit: crazy! As my last installation was ubuntu 14.04, I did another clean install of ubuntu 16.04 from the same DVD I burnt before, but this time did not enable my WiFi while Ubuntu was running from live DVD. So, no content besides what was on xubuntu-16.04-desktop-386.iso could be installed. This time, after the installation on HDD finished and I entered my password for WiFi, firefox 45.0.2 and thunderbird started fine - there even does not exist a file /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins. I will be damned if I ever update Firefox and Thunderbird ... \n", "Q: Will it be possible to switch from systemd to upstart from 15.10 onwards? In Ubuntu 15.04, it is possible to switch from systemd to upstart.  Will this ability be retained going forward?\n\nA: Unlikely anyone will be able to answer this based on facts but I would assume that ...\n\n\n*\n\n*switching from GRUB like you can do now (at run time) is likely to disappear and this is also likely to happen when 16.04 LTS arrives. During the Ubuntu Developer Summit (UDS 14.03) Mark Shuttleworth announced that systemd will be used as default on the next LTS version of Ubuntu, Ubuntu 16.04.\n\n*but as long as the package is available you can install it yourself. 15.10 still has upstart. How well new services will be supported by upstart is anyone's guess. Even I myself doubt it will be supported.\nSo I assume the answer is yes but with increasingly difficulty. I would forget about upstart and get to know systemd. In this case I would advice to not swim against the current.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu within XP Recently my laptop with Ubuntu installed on it, finally gave up.\nI have removed the HDD and mounted it in an external casing and plugged it in to my desktop which runs WinXp.\nOn my Ubuntu machine I had WinXp installed within Ubuntu using Virtualbox.\nI know I can do the reverse on my WinXP machine, but what I was wondering was whether I can use VirtualBox to use my existing Ubuntu installation on the external drive?\nThanks\nAlexis\n\nA: I think you are asking whether you are able to boot your installed ubuntu installation as a virtual machine using virtual box;\nDirectly with no work required you are unable to do this as it is a physical installation and not a bootable image, that said;\nThere is a way that you are able to make a live CD/DVD of a physical installation that you could then use to boot into using virtualbox.\nThe method is rather lengthy but you can read about it on the ubuntu forum\n\nA: The easiest method to get to your desired end state would be to set up a dual boot of Ubuntu/XP on your desktop PC.  Then you could copy all your data from the old hard drive into the new Ubuntu install.\nMy #1 option for you would be to install Ubuntu instead of XP on the desktop and then copy the files, but I realize you may have some XP stuff you need to keep.\nSetting up a dual boot with XP is way easier than it is with the newer versions.  It's also way easier than trying to extract your old Ubuntu to a virtual machine.\n", "Q: Lubuntu stopped booting desktop, just goes to command line I was trying to get the text right on my TV monitor so I was messing with xorg.conf.\nWell, I didn't see one so I ran the command sudo nvidia-xconfig.\nThat added the file so then I added Options \"DPI\" \"96x96\" to the 'monitor' section.\nWhen I rebooted my desktop it asked for my username and pass, then went to a command line..\nI have no idea what to do.

I used the USB stick to install Ubuntu on my laptop, but that doesn't work on my other computer. When I get to the BIOS menu, I have tried booting from usb-hdd, usb-fdd and usb-zip, but I always end up starting the computer in Windows 7. Does anyone know why it doesn't work? \n\nA: Different computers have different requirements on bootable usb sticks, most of which make exactly 0 sense. You will be able to boot from a usb stick if you use this command:\nsudo dd bs=8M if=/path/to/image.iso of=/dev/sdx\n\nTo get what to put instead of /dev/sdx, enter df -h when your thumb drive is mounted. You'll see a line like\n/dev/sdb1                  30G   30G  706M  98% /media/christoph/Ubuntu 15.04 amd64\n\nFor your thumb drive.\nThe unfortunate thing about this solution is that it's really ugly. It'll destroy all partitions on the thumb drive. After you used it, to get the usb stick back to normal, open GParde, switch to your usb stick, and choose Device → Create Partition Table, then make a partition again.\nNote that a lot of computers have a problem with more than 1 partition on a bootable usb stick, so removing additional partitions might be enough and you don't have to revert to this ugly solution.\n", "Q: Does the internet runs slower when the display is off? I have an application which runs in background(it connects to internet and does some stuff)  but it seems that when the display is off is works very slow or almost stops. Is this a setting or something in ubuntu touch that I can disable it? Currently I need to tap on the display continously to prevent this which is very annoying. \n\nA: Currently the Ubuntu Touch platform does not allow applications to run in the background, or while the screen is off... this is a known limitation of the platform which will be addressed at some point (sorry, I don't know more details, perhaps search launchpad for a bug or log one so that it could be tracked).\nAs a last ditch workaround you could install an application \"Active Screen\" to stop the screen from switching off.\n\nA: In the battery settings set the \"Sleep when idle\" to Never, but it is just temporary solution. \n", "Q: Troublesome Paraview installation with 12.04 LTS (and not with 14.04 LTS) As I try and install Paraview on a desktop running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with\nsudo apt-get install paraview\n\nI receive a lengthy warning, whose most worrisome part is\n\nThe following packages will be REMOVED:google-earth-stable ia32-libs ia32-libs-multiarch:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libglapi-mesa:i386 libglu1-mesa:i386 libhdf5-serial-1.8.4 libqt4-opengl:i386 libvisual-0.4-plugins:i386 nvidia-331-updates skype skype-bin:i386 xorg xserver-xorg\n\nwhich seems to me rather excessive and greedy since it's aiming to remove some other important and unrelated packages such as Google Earth or Skype. Obviously I don't continue.\nThe interesting piece of information is that the same apt-get command runs smoothly and without such auto-immune demands on another machine operated by Ubuntu 14.04 LTS where, for example, both Google Earth and Skype are installed too.\nI have reasons (left) to have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS running on the first computer. The question is then: is anybody aware of the causes of this auto-immune behaviour of Paraview? What could be fixes and workarounds? \nNB I could not create a 'Paraview' tag owing to my young forum age, but a senior member may find it useful to do so.\n\nA: You have a 64bit Ubuntu installation, so by default it will try to install amd64 architecture packages it will look for paraview:amd64 which does depend on libgl1-mesa-glx:amd64. See http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/paraview\nOn other hand, you already have google-earth-stable & skype on i386 architecture of same libraries.\nAFAIK, The easiest solution is to install i386 version of paraview \nsudo apt-get install paraview:i386\n\n\nA: Thanks for spotting this. \nI partly solved the problem but run into bigger ones with Brasero. I'll explain in steps. \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install paraview:i386 did not conflict with skype or google earth indeed, but required the installation of new libraries apt-get could not completely take care of; \n\n*I then uninstalled skype and google earth and installed paraview:amd64 allowing it to remove libraries -- the installation of Paraview went well.\n\n*However, reinstalling either skype or google earth required multiarchitecture libraries anyhow. Moreover, apt-get started to demand several dependencies one after another. apt-get itself suggested to do a sudo apt-get -f install, which I did. Fixing broken links took a little longer and I saw some applications disappear from the menu bar. However, on the whole, this was beneficial since Paraview, Skype and Google Earth were working properly. \n\n*Finally, I decided to reinstall the programs that had ben removed by step 3, namely Brasero with a sudo apt-get install brasero.\n\n*Here come the troubles as apt-get on brasero asked to remove something like a hundred applications. Mistakenly I thought that these were application to add so I gave leeway to it. As a result brasero showed the same autoimmune behaviour of Paraview earlier. With more havoc though: it immediately affected the internet connectivity (the browser could not find any URL). On reboot, moreover, lightdm had also been compromised. \nI will now create a separate incident report to describe this further. \n", "Q: how to install lxterminal 0.2.0-1 (vivid) in Lubuntu 14.04 How to install this specific version of LXterminal in Lubuntu?\nI have tried synaptic package manager but it tells me that my lxterminal it's up to date.\nEDIT: I am interested in this version because it allows in the settings to change copy and paste keyboard commands.

Complete video beginner here.\nI have a bunch of old videos in multiple formats and codecs - like birthday videos, undergrad random captures etc.\nThere is a large number of files that amount to ~25GB in total - all 720p or lesser likely 480p. I would like to make them smaller with minimal loss in quality.\nI thought about re-encoding them using avconv or ffmpeg - I'm on Ubuntu 15.04 64b and this Stack Overflow post tells me they are actually different for my OS.\nAn analysis I found tells me wmv as a codec might give me smallest size without too much loss in quality. But, other articles say h264 (enabled by the libx264-dev package) allows a lot of compression (which I do not understand how to do wih minimal quality loss).\nHow I get smaller files (with sample commands preferably) - wmv or compressed h264?\n\nA: Example: H.264 video + stream copied audio in Matroska\nffmpeg -i input -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a copy output.mkv\n\nAnything WMV is a joke. H.264 video via the encoder libx264 is your best bet right now. While H.265 looks good on paper the implementations just are not quite there yet for typical usage (unless your time is cheap because it is slow).\nYou basically only need to change -crf and -preset:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the highest -crf value that still gives an acceptable quality. Range is a log scale of 0-51. 0 is lossless (huge files). Around 18 is considered visually lossless. 23 is default.\n\n*Use the slowest preset you have patience for. They are: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium [default], slow, slower, veryslow, placebo (ignore placebo; it's too slow for any potential significant advantage over veryslow).\n\n*Now use the same -crf and -preset for the rest of your batch of videos.\nThe audio is being stream copied instead of re-encoded because the vast majority of data will be video.\nWith all of that, I must point out that 25G is small and storage is cheap. If I were in this situation I'd probably just keep the original videos and not bother with re-encoding. Also, re-encoding may not help if the originals were encoded properly with a modern, efficient format.\nAlso see\nFFmpeg Wiki: H.264 Video Encoding Guide\n\nA: Lord Neckbeard is right. WMV comperession is poor. The best compression available at the moment of writing is H.265\nExample: H.265 HEVC video + stream copied audio in Matroska\nffmpeg -i inputfile -c:a copy -c:v libx265 -preset veryfast -x265-params crf=25 -vf scale=-8:ih outputfile.mkv\nQuoting Lord Neckbeards accurate statements.\nYou basically only need to change -crf and -preset to match your quality and speed requirements:\nUse the highest -crf value that still gives an acceptable quality. Range is a log scale of 0-51. 0 is lossless (huge files). Around 18 is considered visually lossless. 23 is default.\nUse the slowest preset you have patience for. They are: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium [default], slow, slower, veryslow, placebo (ignore placebo; it's too slow for any potential significant advantage over veryslow).*\n    Now use the same -crf and -preset for the rest of your batch of videos.\"\n\nThe CRF scales for x264 and x265 do not correspond. x265 CRF 28 is supposedly equivalent to x264 CRF 23. But x265 is not yet as mature in its development as x264, so take that CRF equivalence with a pinch of salt. \nI've been very happy with the compression and quality with the settings above. Adjust them to your liking.\nBreaking down the command above:\n-c:a copy copies the audio stream without re-encoding it.\n-c:v libx265 chooses libx265 as the video codec\n-crf is explained above as is -preset\nscale=-8:ih avoids mangling the video beyond recognizability in the event that the source video isn't an exact multiple of 8 pixels in width (necessary for some input files)\nSources: \nExperience\nVideo codec for making home videos smaller?\nhttps://video.stackexchange.com/questions/16664/what-crf-or-settings-i-should-choose-for-h265-in-order-to-achieve-a-similiar-qua\nhttps://video.stackexchange.com/questions/16664/what-crf-or-setting\n", "Q: Is this normal MAAS DHCP behavior? I believe I've setup the Ubuntu MAAS cluster controller correctly and it's configured to use managed DHCP & DNS (maas-dhcp & maas-dns).  Seems to work reasonably well but I'm seeing the following possible bugs/issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems like the DHCP server has skipped a particular IP address in the middle of the range, for some reason it doesn't like the .23 IP address within the Class C.  Reviewing the /var/lib/maas/dhcp/dhcpd.leases file it's never issued this IP address.  Given that this is on a private/backbone Ethernet switch it's not that anything else has used this address.\n\n*It seems like the DHCP server has begun the dynamic IP issuance starting from .21 even though the MAAS \"Edit Cluster Interface\" screen clearly indicates .20 as the \"DHCP dynamic IP range low value\".  Reviewing the leases file shows that it's never been issued.\n\n*When PXE-booting the third/fourth/fifth nodes I'm seeing that the DHCP server has a fondness of re-issuing the same IP addresses .24 and .25, for example.  Reviewing the leases I see that occasionally there's an \"ends...\" line which presumably is issuing a short-lived (30-second) IP address to a newly-seen node; this is to be expected.  But there are sometimes when it's issued a 12-hour IP address lease to a node that's been named; this feels like it's a possible issue that's re-using the same IP addresses.\n\n\nOf course, it's possible that I don't yet understand the nuances of the MAAS DHCP strategy of issuing IP addresses to a pool of resources.\nI include here one of the paragraphs from dhcpd.leases for review:\nlease 10.100.100.24 {\n  starts 4 2015/09/03 18:19:03;\n  ends 5 2015/09/04 06:19:03;\n  cltt 4 2015/09/03 18:19:03;\n  binding state active;\n  next binding state free;\n  rewind binding state free;\n  hardware ethernet 00:1d:09:9a:5f:4f;\n  client-hostname \"psi\";\n}\n\nPerhaps naively I started writing down the node name versus the issued IP address in a worksheet for tracking.  And I considered labeling the nodes with their issued IP addresses.  Or are IP addresses in this setup just too dynamic for this style of management?\nUbuntu 14.0.4.2LTS64bit\nmaas:\n  Installed: 1.7.6+bzr3376-0ubuntu2~14.04.1\nmaas-dns:\n  Installed: 1.7.6+bzr3376-0ubuntu2~14.04.1\nmaas-dhcp:\n  Installed: 1.7.6+bzr3376-0ubuntu2~14.04.1\n\n\nA: As you may know, DHCP is really all about re-use of IP addresses, so you shouldn't be surprised by this behaviour.  Providing no address is handed out when there's already an active lease, and addresses are being handed out when requested, DHCP is doing its job.  The DHCP specifications don't set out rules as to the order of assignment of addresses, so although one might expect them to be handed out in a monotonically increasing sequence, there's no constraint on a server to do this.\n", "Q: Can I have the portability of a LiveUSB with the performance of a USB install? In particular I would like to have a dynamically installed GPU driver based on the target system. NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel.\nSo I know I can make a persistent LiveUSB whereby there would be anywhere up to 4GB (I think that's the max) of persistent storage for downloads, etc.\nI'd like to configure a USB install to have the platform adaptability that a Live OS offers while fully utilizing the 120GB of space I have.\nIn essence I'm hoping to have a boot up install that reconfigures most/all the hardware/drivers as necessary every boot as I'd like to be able to boot off of it on nearly any machine. (Within reason - they will all be 64-bit)\nThe biggest gripe with doing multi-platform booting is the video driver stuff. Sometimes the system I'm booting off of is AMD, sometimes NVIDIA, sometimes Intel.\nSort of related question: Can I use a USB stick for a normal install? (to get platform adaptability)\n\nA: 4G is the persistence limit only when you use a casper-rw file (since that is the filesize max on a FAT32 filesystem).  Use a partition labeled casper-rw with an ext2-4 filesystem for more storage.  home-rw is a documented filename for your home directory, but I've never used it.\n  Use the \"toram\" keyword on the kernel boot line and the live-media's compressed filesystem will be copied to ram for much better runtime performance (at the expense of some additional boot time for the copy).  \n\nThe \"toram\" is not a flag but a word like \"persistent\" which goes on the kernel boot lines.  For legacy boots, \"toram\" goes on the \"append\" line after the \"kernel\" line in the /syslinux/txt.cfg file.  For UEFI boots, \"toram\" goes on the \"linux\" line in /boot/grub/grub.cfg.  You can switch from the casper-rw file to the partition anytime, but if you wait, be sure and remember to copy over what has been created in the file to the partition.  I tend to set up the partition before the install, then just have to delete the file before I boot for the first time.\n", "Q: Automount drive on startup I have an internal HDD with all my Steam games loaded on it.

I'm using Ubuntu 15.04 and sometimes when I open up a specific application, it opens up on the top left corner of the screen. That's all good, but the portion that allows you to be able to drag a window around is stuck behind the black bar menu on top that has your wifi, battery, time stuff on it. Refer to the screenshot below:\nEDIT: I need 10 rep points in order to post an image so I hope people understand my issue without needing a screenshot.\nAs you can see, the application is launching behind the menu bar making it unable to be moved. I have to exit the application and relaunch it a few times since its place on the screen seems to be random. Is there a way to fix this or is this completely the application's fault?\n\nA: There are keyboard shortcuts which allow you to minimize, maximize, and move windows in Ubuntu. If you can click on the problematic application so that is active, you can use: \nAlt+Space then N to Minimize, \nAlt+Space then  X  to Maximize/Unmaximize, and: \nAlt+Space then M to Move. \nIf you can only invoke a menu with this shortcut: \nAlt+Sapce\nyou can use the pointer (or arrow key) to highlight then select the option you'd like. \n\nA: That is one of the most annoying things ever!\nThe Unity is a compiz plugin and you are using a compiz desktop so first, install compizconfig-settings-manager. Open a terminal and execute the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nccsm &\n\nNow, scroll down the screen to the Window Management category, enable the Move Window plugin and then exit ccsm.\nBy default, this plugin is set to initiate a window move when you press ALT + the Left Click Button on your mouse. \nSo, move your mouse over anywhere in the window, hold down ALT and press the left click mouse button to click and drag the offending window down from behind the panel.\nAlso, I seem to remember having a plugin enabled or disabled that would cause the behavior you are experiencing but can't remember what it was.

I stumbled across primusrun today - usually I just use optirun.\nNote: This may be useful: https://applicative-games.cppcabrera.com/posts/hybrid-gfx-ubuntu.html\n\nA: Bumblebee is the current workaround for using Nvidia optimus with linux. \nAt the heart of bumblebee has been VirtualGL which is now being superseded by Primus.\nIf you have Bumblebee you'll know that to use your discrete card you need to invoke optirun application from the command line and then after a short wait your application runs using the VirtualGL backend. \nUnfortunately the VirtualGL backend does not play nice with some applications, particularly Wine and Crossover. \nPrimus is the replacement of optirun and it all it means to the end user is that instead of using optirun you now invoke an app with primusrun application.\nThe developers of Bumbleebee highly recommend primus over VirtualGL because there are a host of benefits. \nOne benefit is that it works perfectly with Wine and Crossover meaning You can play your Windows games on your discrete card instead of having to use your integrated one and has substantially better performance too.\n", "Q: Bluetooth Pairing on Dual boot of Windows & Ubuntu - Stop having to Pair Devices Repeatedly When switching from Windows to Ubuntu, you may find yourself having to pair your device again.

I am installing Ubuntu 12.04 onto a new partition because I need to use a program that won't run on 14.04, which is the only OS on the machine right now. \nCan I set things up so that files I save with that program in 12.04 are accessible to 14.04?\n\nA: You can create a separate (non-LVM) partition for that purpose. When you boot either of the Ubuntu versions you can mount that partition at the location where you want to have the data files.\nFor this to happen automatically you will have to add this partition to the /etc/fstab file in both your Ubuntu instances.\nFor testing, you can do first mount the partition manually and then later add it to /etc/fstab. Make sure to backup your fstab file first and have a live-disk at hand to restore it if there is a problem and your system won't boot. Also see AutomaticallyMountPartitions\nAnother easier option is to run Ubuntu 12.04 in a VM and then mount a shared folder. \nI run Ubuntu 14.04 at work, but some projects that I work on require Windows. I have Windows XP and Windows 7 running in VirtualBox VMs and have a folder on my Ubuntu machine that is mounted as a drive under Window. This is where I share and move data between Windows and Linux.\n\nA: A variant on NZD's approach is to share a /home partition; however, if you do this you should use different home directories. The easiest way to do this is to use different usernames, at least during installation. You can change your username after installation while keeping the original home directory. The end result is that the user kim (if that's what you use) has a home directory of /home/kim in Ubuntu 14.04, but kim in 12.04 has a home directory of, say, /home/kim1204.\nOf course, if you've got an existing 14.04 installation that does not use a separate /home directory, adjusting that setup to have a separate /home directory will take a significant amount of effort, which may not be worth the bother.\n", "Q: repair ubuntu in a dual boot It's simple.

Any ideas?\nEDIT: The contents of my /etc/inputrc file: http://pastebin.com/vnGy9n1i\n\nA: You have probably set d as a keyboard shortcut for something. The likeliest culprit will be a shortcut set up in Preferences => Shortcuts of gnome-terminal. Make sure you haven't set D to something there. \nIf you are using xbindkeys, have a look at ~/.xbindkyesrc and remove the offending entry. Alternatively, check your desktop envoronment's keyboard shortcut settings and see if you've set anything up there (but I doubt that would cause the issue you describe).  \nAnother possibility is that you have a bind command in your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc (or any other shell setup file) files that disables the d.

I want to get an idea who's consuming the data the most.\nIf it's possible, how can I do it? Is raspberry pi capable of doing this? Any instructions will be much appreciated.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: My favourite tool for this task is ipfm (\"IP Flow Meter\"). In contract to wireshark it does not require to log the actual content of the traffic, and in contrast to ntop it does not aggregate transferred data from when you start looking at the tool. It aggregates traffic data permanently and saves the result in log files.\nInstallation:\nsudo apt install ipfm\n\nConfiguration: Edit /etc/ipfm.conf while looking at the documentation in man ipfm.conf.\nUsage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start it with sudo ipfm\n\n*After config file changes, restart it with sudo killall ipfm && sudo ipfm.\n\n*To see results, look at the log files it writes, as you configured in /etc/ipfm.conf.\n\n\nA: I think for your need wireshark would be goof for your need, you can install it from their website or through PPA if it isn't available in your repositories (which i think will be the case if you are using a raspberry pi) But you have to be careful as the pi might not be able to handle all this information. \nthe method to do this in Ubuntu is with the following commands, I don't think it'll be very different for the pi:\nsudo apt-get install wireshark\nsudo groupadd wireshark\nsudo usermod -a -G wireshark YOUR_USER_NAME\nsudo chgrp wireshark /usr/bin/dumpcap\nsudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/dumpcap\nsudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/bin/dumpcap\nsudo getcap /usr/bin/dumpcap\n\nAlso check out this: http://sectools.org/tag/traffic-monitors/  this is great for monitoring data but fairly advanced to operate, although you will find tutorials and forums for it as well.\nBTW: If you are running this on a normal PC it should be fine, and also after rereading your question i saw that there isn't actually that much data so the Pi should be fine as well.\n\nA: If you are planning to use a raspberry pi, then you will in to install a Linux server edition, which don't have a graphical environment that will consume lots of resources for nothing. \nYou can install ntop :\nhttp://www.ntop.org/get-started/download/\nIt just do everything.\nYou even have a version for Ras pi.\n", "Q: Sometimes all of my directories are locked and I have to restart to fix it, I wonder why? I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my HP Pavilion-14 ex024tc laptop. It works well, but sometimes it would lock all of my folders while there shows a small lock icon along with the folder's icon.\nWhen that happens, I can only visit my files in read-only mode, It really matters. So I have to reboot my laptop and I'll get a info told me that there is a mount error and I need to press F to fix it. It always work so I can use my computer normally after that.\nI want to know why this matter happens and I want to fix it. Any one have any ideas?\nThank you!\n\nA: I recommend you to use \"mount\" command in console and look for / if it is mounted as ro (readonly) or rw (readwrite).\nIf it is mounted as ro, please check /var/log/syslog (you can use tail or less) for disk errors. Normally root partition is remounted on errors as read only - so that probably means your hard drive has failure or your filesystem is corrupted.\nI recommend you to run this command as root (when filesystem is read-write) \"touch /forcefsck\" and reboot your system. This will force file system check and might solve your issue.\n", "Q: Lock the position of desktop icon 14.03 I was wondering if there is a way to prevent a user from moving a desktop icon but it still be usable?

I hesitate about keeping my touchscreen disabled on my Ubuntu installation.\nI disabled it by adding Option \"Ignore\" \"on\" to the\n/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf file :\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"evdev touchscreen catchall\"\n        MatchIsTouchscreen \"on\"\n        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        Driver \"evdev\"\n    Option \"Ignore\" \"on\"\nEndSection\n\n\nDoes disabling (or ignoring) the touchscreen extend battery life or does it have any impact ?\n\nA: One possible solution is to check it. Install powertop:\nsudo apt-get install powertop \n\nand run it (I use an averaging time of 30s, use one that gives more or less constant values when the system is idle):\nsudo powertop --time 30\n\n\nThe power consumption is shown there --- try it with and without touchscreen and compare results. Although I suspect that @A.B. is right --- it will be mostly negligible. \n\nA: Technically, yes. But you will not notice the difference.\nSorry to be the harbinger of bad news. ;)\n", "Q: Meizu MX4 how to make full resolution pictures with camera app? I bought a Meizu MX 4  phone with Ubuntu pre-installed and I love it. \nThe only problem I encountered untill today: the camera is supposed to be a 20Mp camera, but I can't seem to find a way to make pictures with that resolution. I tried all possible combinations of setting (there are few) and I alway get a 3Mp photo. \nI have tried re-intalling the camera app, to no succes. \n\nA: On my Meizu MX4 pictures are of size 5120x2880 ≈ 15 Mpix - there is a known bug related to the camera and size of the pictures in Ubuntu for phones.\nYou might want to change the channel to rc-proposed and check if that helps a bit.

Here is a very easy way to create one and for that you'll need: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 .iso file. If you do not have the .iso file, you can download it from here (either direct download or torrent download, whichever you prefer).\n\n*An empty USB drive of size 1.5 GB or more. \n\n*A Windows OS with administrative permission\n\n*This software Universal USB Installer. \n\n\nWhen you have these things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just run the Universal USB Installer. \n\n*Select \"Ubuntu\" from the list of Linux Distributions. \n\n*Browse to the location of the .iso file and select it. \n\n*Select the letter of your USB and click create. Any previously stored data on USB will be lost.\n\n\nAfter creating the boot-able USB, just plug it in your computer and turn it on. To make sure your computer boots from USB, you may have to select \"Boot Device options\" (by either pressing Esc or F12 depending on your computer) and then selecting USB drive from the list. \nOnce you boot your computer from USB, Just follow the EXACT procedure for Boot-Repair as given on the Ubuntu Wiki.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Some laptops, maybe desktops, are problems for the latest versions of Ubuntu.  This is because Grub2 doesn't always get things right.  Boot Repair will tell you if this is a problem and offer to replace grub as a means of fixing it.  I did that, and it worked for me.  But there were manual commands the Boot Repait told me to enter as well\nIf you did not finish the install process, you will be missing stuff.  Getting the system up and running is not enough, as that is all handled in the early disk writing stages.  To properly fix your system, you really need to do a reinstall.  \nReinstall is not that difficult.  Instead of choosing one of the other options listed on the page of how to install, you pick the last option, which is probably labeled \"Something else\".  Here you have choices, and you need to duplicate your original install as to disk(s) partition(s) assignments, use the same drive structure, but don't click on the Format button for the disk partition that has the /home folder.  Most people likely default to just drive /dev/sda1, ext4, everything there, and a swap partition as well. If you don'r know what your original structure us, yse the LiveCD or boot up and run gparted.  It can tell you a lot.\nIf you format the partition with /home on it, you wipe out your user accounts and data, and we usually want to avoid that.  Two alternatives are to install the operating system to a different drive, but keep the /home directory where it is, or later merge the old /home directory with a new one set up on a different partition.  You also have the option of backing up /home to a different location and bringing it back later.\nI can't say that a reinstall is absolutely necessary, but it does resolve the question of whether you are missing anything or not. Something that might be hard to determine otherwise.  .  \n", "Q: Help needed on installation of USB ethernet adapter in Ubuntu 14.04.3 I am totally new to Ubuntu. I am running Ubuntu 14.04.3 now.

But there are occasions where you want the boot to go to a different drive, like a USB HDD.  People put grub2 on DVDs, CDs, floppies, or USB drives.  They have to plug in the particular booy means to get into the Linux system.  Otherwise, the sysrem boots from the first hard drive it can find with a boot process in the MBR.\nA couple of links that go into the process in more detail:\nhttp://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows \nNote: It's not that tricky, really.

I use the manual way above myself, but there are those that that might prefer this way.  The key is the small search box in the upper left corner of the Window.  Type in the name of the app (firefox) or group (browser), and a list of choices should come up.  The manual command line method works, but you have to know the application package name.  Or use partial names with wildcards, but that can be chancy.\n", "Q: patching kernel (every update?) I'm about to apply that famous patch that makes vgaarb see nvidia as a VGA device to the kernel.\nBut Linux releases a new kernel only every 2 month as I know. And Ubuntu kernel releases are even later.\nSo is the above the only way to patch the new kernel every time?\n\nA: Too short for an answer, but I'll risk it:\nYes, you have to patch the kernel every time. This is logical, and comparable with the update of proprietary modules, such as Nvidia. To automate patching, you could use DKMS, as does Nvidia.\n", "Q: groupadd: group 'xxxx' already exist I have created a group in Ubuntu terminal called terminal using groupadd terminal command and when I list out the groups using groups command it will not show the newly created group name in the output but if I add the same group again it gives me \ngroupadd: group 'terminal' already exists\n\nerror message but the group name exists in /etc/group file.

I used Chrome but there's little difference. You can start from a full install or an Ubuntu Server install (and just install the bits you need).\nThere is far too much to go into but I'll give you the brief outline here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install things you'll need. Here's a suggestion if you're coming from Server:\nsudo apt install --no-install-recommends xorg openbox firefox pulseaudio\n\n\n*Prep the browser. Chrome has its own kiosk mode but Firefox will likely need something like R-Kiosk installing.\n\n*Create a script of things to launch (pulseaudio, firefox, etc) in the X session. If you're coming from a Desktop install, you'll need to disable some things (like lightdm) too.\n\n*Create a new Upstart script (assuming 14.04 LTS) to launch X and start that script. You'll be launching something like this:\nsudo -u $USER startx /etc/X11/Xsession /opt/kiosk.sh --\n\n\n*Consider security, networking, remote access, etc, etc.\nAs for hardware, you can get dedicated kiosk hardware, or just take a consumer 24\" screen, a USB touchscreen overlay and a low-end computer (even a Raspberry Pi 2) and put the two together. Even if you have to custom-make an enclosure, it's likely going to be cheaper than a 24\" tablet.\n", "Q: Wine cmd terminal suddenly popup I've downloaded Mr. Robot e10 from torrents and it contain the movie but it was invalid and when I removed extension it appear as windows executable.

I like it and everything is working fine. I just wondered if it's possible to replace the Raspberry Pi with a PC and also make it working as a server. The PC is equipped with a Xeon X3360 and a ATI Radeon HD5450, I was thinking of turning it into a home server (Ubuntu Server working like file server, print server and torrent downloader for the moment), and install Kodi on it. A practical solution that let Kodi visible and accessible via TV (Currently I can control Kodi with the remote control of the TV thanks to HDMI, the Radeon should allow to do the same because it's also equipped with HDMI port), but that also allows to control the Ubuntu Server (access via ssh or rather through a visual interface from another pc) to download torrents and perform other common tasks. \nI hope I have explained the idea in a right way.\nIn case, is it possible?\nIf yes, which distro (Ubuntu, Ubuntu Server, etc.), what software and how to set it up. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: It is possible. If I would do it like that, I would use whatever distribution I know best. If this is Ubuntu with you, I would use Ubuntu server as a base.\nI would suggest though to use one PC as server (in a home environment I would opt for power efficient components, my guess would be the xeon cpu uses rather a lot power) and the raspberry pi with openELEC as client.\nWhy? A server makes noise, the hard drives and fans are loud, you don't want them near your living room. And secondly, most pc equipment doesn't support cec (thats what enables your pi/kodi being controlled via HDMI with the TVs remote.)\nIf you still want to do your idea, use Ubuntu server, samba for file sharing, cups for printing, rtorrent in a screen for torrents, kodi with a basic graphical environment for playing videos and a USB CEC adapter for control through the TV remote.\n", "Q: What does this terminal message mean?

A step by step instructions would be very nice.\n\nA: If you would like to just try out Ubuntu and not install it, skip to the last section, otherwise, keep reading. \nHere is a step-by-step procedure to set up Ubuntu on dual-boot with Windows.\nThe first thing you need to do is to create free space on your system by shrinking any of your existing partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Management by typing it into the start menu search bar. There you can right click any of your drives and shrink them by any amount which is >= 50 GB.

This is where we shall set up Ubuntu.\n\n*If you know what a \"Live USB\"/\"Bootable CD/DVD\" is and have set one up, skip this step.\nAssuming that you haven't set up bootable media for your Ubuntu installation, here is a tutorial for that. Just copying the Ubuntu iso file that you have downloaded onto the flash drive won't help. You need to be able to boot via that flash drive. For that, install tool called Universal USB Installer (UUI) from here. After installing this file, set up the live USB by following the on-screen instructions and go on to the next step while you keep the USB plugged in.\n\n*Restart the system, and before Windows loads, press the hotkey particular to your system that takes you to the BIOS setup. It is usually written on the bottom part of the screen.\n\n*Once you're in the BIOS menu, go to boot device options and select the USB flash drive that you have plugged in.\n\n\nNow you will be presented with two options:\nTry Ubuntu and install Ubuntu. Try Ubuntu lets you get the feel of how Ubuntu works without actually having to install it on your Hard Drive. Choose the one according to your need. \nTry UBUNTU\nThis option, as stated above will give you a demo of how Ubuntu works.\nInstall Ubuntu\nHere, follow the on screen instructions, until you get the screen where the options look like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase Windows and install Ubuntu\n\n*Let the system decide\n3.Something else.\nchoose something else here!\n\n*Now click on the free space that is listed (remember the free space that we created in windows), change it to 20480 MiB, Primary, ext4 journaling filesystem, and set the mount point as /\n\n*Repeat the step by setting the memory to the amount of RAM you have,Primary, and filesystem as Swap area.\n\n*Allocate the rest of the area to a mount point called /home (Rest remains same).\nContinue with the on screen instructions, let Ubuntu set up your files and be patient. \nOnce done, enjoy your new liberated experience!\n\nA: First, make sure the USB stick you are using is okay to erase. You will lose all data on the disk.\nAssuming you are on Windows, first, you want to download Ubuntu here. LTS versions will be supported longer. Then, you want a tool called Pen Drive Linux. Download and run it, select Ubuntu, and then the .iso file you downloaded earlier. Once complete, turn off the computer and restart it.\nIf all is well, Ubuntu will load up. If not, you may need to press F12 or Delete on bootup (depending on computer) and select the USB disk as a boot device. When it does load, make sure to select Try Ubuntu. You can mess around in this, and even access files from your hard drive. This will be much slower than an actual install, so keep that in mind, and settings changes will not remain. If you would like to install both, you'll need to do something called dual boot (which I recommend to do with a second hard drive).\nHere's some more documentation on Dual Boot: link\n", "Q: How can I make keyboard shortcuts register on key release, rather than on key press?

And thanks to the others too.\nPlease tell me what to do, thanks\n\nA: In order to use a live USB, restart your computer. Enter the computer's BIOS using the Esc or F1 key or whatever allows access to the BIOS. Under bootup options or similar, be sure that booting from USB is enabled. Make sure the boot priority has USB first. Save the new settings, if any, and proceed to boot. You will then boot into Ubuntu on the USB rather than the operating system on the harddrive.\n\nA: A LiveUSB is used to boot a computer system, plainly plugging it into a computer as a normal flash drive would be of no help.\nTo boot from a LiveUSB, you need to ensure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*You know which key to press at startup, which will take you to the BIOS setup.\n\n*Booting from USB is enabled. This is mostly not an option, as booting from a USB is enabled by default.\n\n\nAt startup, you need to press the hotkey, enter the boot options, and select the USB as the device to boot from.\nThe problem with rearranging the boot order is that in future, if you try to boot your system with a USB plugged in it may cause problems.\nSo the above mentioned technique should work just fine.\nCheers! \n", "Q: Install RocketRaid 644L Raid Controller driver on Ubuntu I bought a RocketRaid 644L and get stuck at driver installation. \nuname -a\nLinux hb38-backup 3.2.0-41.generic #66-Ubuntu x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nlsb_release\nDescription: Ubuntu 12.04.2\n\nlspci\nRAID bus controller: HighPoint Technologies, Inc.

Everything is working great when I manually boot into Ubuntu (i.e. pressing ctrl-L at the dev mode screen). However, I am not able to automatically boot into Ubuntu upon restart; the system always boots into Chrome OS unless I press ctrl-L at the boot screen. I tried the command sudo cgpt add -i 6 -P 5 -S 1 /dev/sda a few times in both Ubuntu terminal and Chrome OS bash to try to set the boot priority, but it seems to just ignore this and boot into Chrome OS anyway (no error messages either). How can I set Ubuntu as the default OS?\n\nA: I figured it out after a few hours of googling - here are the details for anyone that might run into a similar problem: \n1.) Remove the firmware write-protect screw inside the Chromebox as shown in the picture here (requires a screwdriver and opening of the case).\n2.) Follow the instructions here under the section \"Boot to SeaBIOS by default\".\nEssentially, once the write-protect screw is removed, the commands (in Chrome OS shell) are: \nsudo su\nflashrom --wp-disable\nflashrom --wp-status\n/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh\n/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x489\nflashrom --wp-enable\n\nSome of the above commands might just be informational, I think the wp-status one and the first .sh command, but not totally sure.\n", "Q: Local Ubuntu Mirror NOT working?

WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. \nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland.

This may allow the driver to support\n  more hardware than was included in the driver's static device ID\n  support table at compile time.  The format for the device ID is:\n  VVVV DDDD SVVV SDDD CCCC MMMM PPPP.  That is Vendor ID, Device ID,\n  Subsystem Vendor ID, Subsystem Device ID, Class, Class Mask, and\n  Private Driver Data.  The Vendor ID and Device ID fields are required,\n  the rest are optional. Upon successfully adding an ID, the driver will\n  probe for the device and attempt to bind to it.  For example:\n# echo \"8086 10f5\" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/foo/new_id\n\n\nSo in this case, you should be good with:\nsudo modprobe alx\necho 1969 e0a1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/alx/new_id >/dev/null\n\nI guessed the driver name alx from the patch mentioned in the comments.

App is freeware PC program, Desktop program.\n\nA: There is already a great answer to this question [here](\nHow to get my software into Ubuntu?), by @an drewsomething .But i will reproduce it here for the OP.\nThere are a number of paths that a package can take to enter Ubuntu. The overview of Ubuntu development targeted at \"upstream\" developers like yourself might be a useful place to start, but I'll try to give you some pointers as well.\nThrough Debian\nGenerally, if you are publishing free and open source software going through Debian first is the best path. This way ensures that your package will have a dedicated maintainer. It also will reach the largest number of users as it will be available in not just Debian and Ubuntu but all of their derivatives as well. Some useful links for requesting/providing new packages in Debian:\n\n\n*\n\n*Work-Needing and Prospective\nPackages - Information on how to\nfile \"Intent to Package\" and \"Request\nfor Package\" bugs as well as list of\nopen ITPs and RFPs. \n\n*Debian Mentors\nFAQ - debian-mentors is for the\nmentoring of new and prospective\nDebian Developers. It is where you can\nfind a sponsor to upload your package to the archive.\n\n*Debian Developer's Reference - Debian Developer's Reference's section on new packages. The entire document is invaluable for both Ubuntu and Debian packagers.\nDirectly into Ubuntu\nIn some cases, it might make sense to go directly into Ubuntu first. Some helpful links:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu App Developer site - for lightweight desktop applications, you can submit them directly on the My Apps section of developer.ubuntu.com, the App Review Board will review them and they will be published in the Software Center.\n\n*Packaging Guide - an introduction to how to package for Ubuntu.\n\n*REVU - a web-based tool to which Ubuntu contributors can upload new packages for review by Ubuntu Developers for inclusion into Ubuntu.\n\n*Sponsorship Process - After entering Ubuntu, you can maintain your package through the sponsorship process.\nPersonal Package Archives\nBeyond the official Ubuntu and Debian channels, Launchpad offers you the ability to distribute Debian packages directly to your users through its Personal Package Archives or PPAs for short. One particularly useful aspect of a PPA is that you can provide daily builds of your software for testing purposes.\n", "Q: Its regarding htc one M7 root and install ubuntu I want to completely remove android from my htc one m7 and want to install Ubuntu in my phone but I want this to be done in one step and I don't want make root once and etc., things so please help me.... and please don't suggest me xda developers because there is a long process in it and I want it in one step.\nThank you.\n\nA: There is no one step process for installing Ubuntu Touch on your device right now. However you can try to port it to your device and then install it. \nPlease start here.\nPlease note that this is a long process too. It will require time and patience.\nIf you are unwilling to spend so much time, I would suggest waiting until somebody else ported ubuntu touch to your device and then installing it.\n", "Q: Booting to a Ubuntu USB Drive on a Mac I want to install Ubuntu onto a USB drive and boot into an actual installation of Ubuntu using my MacBook Air, but I'm not sure if this is possible. To clarify, I don't want to install a live version of Ubuntu, with or without persistent storage. I want to use the USB drive as if it were a drive attached to the computer, and I were booting into another fully-installed OS, with the USB drive functioning as the hard drive for that OS. I have read some things about installing Ubuntu on a Mac, and some things about installing a live version on a USB drive (with or without persistent storage), none of these things are exactly what I want to do. -- And, in fact, I did already try installing a live version on a USB drive, but it didn't work properly for some reason. It would boot into Ubuntu and run, but then the graphics would start to get all messed up (I had some issues with things being entirely blacked-out, and one time, the whole screen just went black and stayed that way). I'm not sure if what I want to do is possible, but if it is, or if there are any other ideas anyone has, I'd really appreciate it! I miss Ubuntu so much, and really want to be able to actually use it again. <3\nThank you for any help you can provide!\n\nA: Fairly straightforward and courtesy of ubuntu.com:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu Desktop\n\n*Open OS X Terminal \n\n*Convert the .iso file to .img using the convert option of hdiutil e.g.,\nhdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso\nNote: OS X tends to put the .dmg ending on the output file automatically.\n\n*Run diskutil list to get the current list of devices.\n\n*Insert your flash media\n\n*Run diskutil list again and determine the device node assigned to your flash media, like /dev/disk2\n\n*Run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN replacing N with the disk number from the last command.

I'm guess this is an error seen on the MAAS server as Landscape autopilot doesn't directly talk to vsphere; MAAS does.  It would be helpful if you tried powering the nodes in MAAS via the UI http:///#/nodes to confirm that it succeeds.\nAlso, I have see MAAS' inability to power nodes through vsphere in a case where the vsphere password has non-printable characters potentially due to some urlencoding magic that MAAS does in order to execute power changes through the vsphere API. Here is the bug for more details. In that bug, I found changing my password worked around the issue and MAAS was able to power nodes through pyvmomi.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Error While Creating New Resolution Mode I was trying to create a new resolution for my second monitor following this steps:\nCan't set a higher screen resolution in a external display in a Dell Mini 10v laptop\nbut i got this error:\nX Error of failed request:  BadName (named color or font does not exist)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  140 (RANDR)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  16 (RRCreateMode)\n  Serial number of failed request:  29\n  Current serial number in output stream:  29\n\nwhen i ran this code:\n$ xrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\n\nhow do i move forward?\n\nA: Solved.

I am looking for a new laptop, with the intent to run Ubuntu Linux on it. \nI have a preference for Lenovo, but Asus is good too. So I started looking at the Ubuntu Certified hardware list but then I realized that page doesn’t really help me shop for a New laptop. I cant tell when the laptops came out, if they are new or old, and I see no way to search the certified hardware list for specific hardware details (like CPU speed, RAM, weight, size, networking options, etc...) which would interest me when trying to buy a new laptop with Ubuntu certified hardware. Is there a better site? Is there a sorting mechanism I am missing?\nI am not asking for Prices or for specific vendors. What I am asking, is how I use the list of Ubuntu certified Hardware, in the objective sense, for getting a new laptop. \nFor a little more detail, I have about 500$-600$ for this, which puts me out of business for getting a system76 machine.\n\nA: See latest probes of Ubuntu-powered laptops in this list: https://linux-hardware.org/?view=timeline\nExample probe: https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=16e0fe515b\nYou can find manufacture year in the Host Info section of a probe.

And it's getting blazingly fast if either regain access to network or the network is down (as in ifconfig wlan0 down).\nWhat can I do to still restrict access to network and have the network connectivity on a different user?\n\nA: The problem is that Wine needs 127.0.0.1 access. Use these commands:\niptables -A OUTPUT -p all -s localhost -m owner --uid-owner username -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -p all -m owner --uid-owner username -j DROP\n\nYou can replace localhost by 127.0.0.1 if you like or need.\n", "Q: Drop down terminal that can split gnome I am looking for a good drop down terminal that can be split for gnome. At work I use KDE and Yakuake and it works really good but I don't really like KDE that much. I installed Yakuake in gnome and it is really buggy so I removed it and I am looking for a good one. \nI also see that there are similar topics but they are all out of date. I have looked into terra but the last update to the ppa was in 2013 so was avoiding that one a bit. I am already using screens so having screens nested inside tmux for multi panel terminal doesn't really sound like it will work that well.\nUbuntu 15.04 with Gnome.\n\nA: Personally I think Tilda is the best dropdown terminal. \nI have tried a lot of them, including Yakuake, and I have to say that Tilda is the most customizable one, at least for my taste. At the github page there is information and screenshots regarding configuration options\nTilda exists in the repositories so you can give it a try fairly easily.\n\nA: I used terra terminal for this, but unfortunately developement was abandoned a long time ago and installing manually downloaded packages doesn't work (they're installed, but the program fails to start due to some python dependencies).\nI ended up using guake in combination with tmux. It's not the same since it doesn't split in two but creates a session similar to screen that you can split, but it's totally depending on keystrokes to create/split and change focus so it's not the same:\nCtrl + B, then % Splits vertically\nCtrl + B, then \" Splits horizontally\nCtrl + B, then left/right/up/down Change focus\nCtrl + B + left/right/up/down Change focused window size\n\nAgain, I remember reading in some forum that somebody was requesting such a feature in guake itself, but couldn't find any actual code.\n\nA: Went with terminator and followed this guide to allow for the drop down.

I'm a new Linux user converting from windows. In windows, if I open vlc or other application use it, minimize and decide to run the application again by clicking on a file that is associated with it it will bring the application to the front and be in focus.\nIn ubuntu I have noticed with applications like nautilus, vlc and deluge that if I open the application the first time it brings it to the front with focus but if I minimize and then run it again by clicking on for instance a video file to launch vlc it starts playing in the background, the vlc icon shakes in the launcher but the application does not pop up.\nWhy on earth the ubuntu programmers hava decided to make it like this functionally I will never understand.

With a driver more up to date, it works. First add the bumblebee package, then run the software updater of sudo apt update and new nvidia drivers become available.

If it is ejected or safely removed, /dev/sdc1 goes out from /dev/ folder and /dev/sdc remains, but it is not writable.\nIs it possible to write directly on /dev/sdc?\n\nA: /dev/sdc1 is a \"device file\", and represents the first partition of the device /dev/sdc.\nIt represents the whole partition as a single raw file (i.e. as the sequence of bytes as written in the partition).\nThis is not something understandable in terms of directories / files without interpreting such sequence as a filesystem.\nWhat you see \"out of /dev/\" is the mount point of the filesystem stored in /dev/sdc1, and it's a directory hierarchy result of interpreting the raw content of the partition accordingly to such filesystem.\nThis is needed in order to read / write directories / files; Ubuntu knows how the filesystem works and will be able to handle the partition properly and accordingly to the filesystem in use, in such a way that data can be read / written to it keeping the filesystem consistent.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 installation stuck I am using an usb drive configured to install ubuntu on my laptop.

Sure you should be able to do so (if your firewall rules don't prohibit it.)\nBut what happens when you ping your domain name? ping can only send packages to IP addresses, so it has to resolve the domain name to an IP address. If you do that manually, for example via dig, you should see your public IP address:\n$ dig www.example.com +short\n93.184.216.34\n\nIf this doesn't work (this isn't showing your IP), you cannot ping, because your name server configuration is probably broken.\nIf it does work and you still cannot ping, check if you have iptable rules after all:\nsudo iptables -L\n\nThere might be rules prohibiting incoming our outgoing icmp packets \n", "Q: HDD spin down time is not working after sleep I have two hard drives - ssd and hdd.

When you boot to Windows it switches it to another mode.\nThe default mode is the network card mode. It is possible to use it in this mode in Ubuntu, but it requires manual configuration and connecting/disconnecting in CLI. Scripting can help.\nI suspect that the version of Network Manager supports it in Ubuntu 15.05, but I did not test it yet.\nThe easiest solution is to switch the modem to \"modem\" mode. It can be done by running in terminal\necho -e 'AT^SETPORT=\"A1,A2;10,12,13,A2\"\\r' | sudo tee  /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nThen replug the modem and wait for about 20 seconds for it to boot. Then the option in Network Manager will appear.\nDisadvantage of this is that in Windows, if you use the vendor connection software, it may not work. But you can setup a telephone connection in Windows instead.\nBut it looks like your Windows switches the modem to a good mode for linux, so it should not be a problem.\nThis setting can always be reverted by running\necho -e 'AT^SETPORT=\"A1,A2;12,16,A1,A2\"\\r' | sudo tee  /dev/ttyUSB0\n\n", "Q: Hard Drive invalid NTFS and hidden partition Hi i recently bought a western digital green 2To and put it in an enclosure to use it like a simple external hard drive.

Its a common error that users can't boot into Windows through Grub while using Secure-boot. Some \"image not found\" error comes up. Disabing secure-boot works though.\nThat is when when we install ubuntu after Windows.\nDoes this happen even if we install Windows later than Ubuntu & use Windows loader to get into Ubuntu?\n\nA: I can't say that it definitely occurs in that case, but I don't see why it wouldn't. The problem is basically a GRUB limitation. As such, the order of OS installation is unlikely to make any difference, unless that results in some subtle change to the GRUB configuration that works around the problem. As I know of no such simple workaround, it seems unlikely that order of installation would make any difference even if that changed the GRUB configuration. Furthermore, installing Windows after Ubuntu will cause GRUB to become the secondary boot loader, which means you'll have no OS boot selection menu when you start -- you'll just boot straight to Windows. This is easily corrected if you know how, but it's an extra step.\nFWIW, the bug you refer to is reported here. If you're affected by the bug and haven't already done so, please click the \"Does this bug affect you\" link and confirm that you're affected. This will raise the \"heat\" on the bug and make it more likely that it will be fixed.\nAlso, if you're affected by the bug, a number of workarounds are described in the comments. Aside from disabling Secure Boot, these include using the firmware's own boot manager (comment #9) and using my rEFInd (comment #11; note that installation is easier today than it was two years ago, when I posted that comment -- simply installing the rEFInd PPA or Debian package should do almost everything automatically, provided rEFInd detects a valid copy of Shim).\n", "Q: Locked myself out of Ubuntu Im after some help desperately!\nI currently have a server running ubuntu 14.04.

The server also cannot be accessed by Plex.  (I'm assuming that the firewall is doing what it is supposed to and blocking all incoming connections!)\nSo, im a bit stuck, i can't access the server to turn off the firewall.\nI have tried plugging it into my TV and it says 'Mode not supported' (i believe this is a samsung HDTV thing) so i cant use that to get into it.  I believe this is due to it having the incorrect resolution.  \nI have tried using the samsung TV and getting into the GRUB menu, but as soon as it hits UBUNTU load screen, thats when my tv says it is unsupported.\nAny help really appreciated!!!!!\n\nA: VNC uses port 5900, so if you didn't open that port, you have locked yourself out of access to that application.  Sign in using SSH and open the appropriate port in ufw for VNC.\nDepending on your setup you may have to forward the appropriate ports in your LAN's router as well.\nI'm not clear on what the TV has to do with this problem.\n", "Q: Recovering Files Recently, I got a virus on my computer. I took it to an IT guy, and he had to backup all my files, factory reset the computer, and then put them back on again.

I installed Ubuntu, and I could see all of my Windows files again. Why? And how do i make sure that I don't lost any of those files?\n\nA: Open terminal and run sudo blkid command. If it says just one line with TYPE=ext4 it means you only have Ubuntu. If you have more than one lines, especially if it says TYPE=ntfs , you probably have installed Ubuntu together with Windows on your machine, so there is two OS on your disk now. Which is good !

Why do Apache and Nginx display the same webpage?\nTake a close look at your configuration files. You will see that they both load the same content:\nApache is loading (document root): /var/www/html\nNginx is loading (root): /var/www/html;\nThis means both servers will show the same content, as they are loading the same file(s). You can change your \"root\" directory to be two different locations by editing your configuration files.\neg apache:\n<VirtualHost *:8080>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/apache\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\neg nginx:\nserver {\n    listen       8080;\n    server_name  127.0.0.1;\n    root /var/www/html/nginx;\n    index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;\n\n    location / {\n            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n    }\n\n    error_page 404 /404.html;\n    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;\n\n    location = /50x.html {\n            root /var/www/html/nginx;\n    }\n\n    location ~ \\.php$ {\n            try_files $uri =404;\n            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;\n            fastcgi_index index.php;\n            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;\n            include fastcgi_params;\n    }\n}\n\nYou'd then need to make each directory and put a file in them:\nmkdir /var/www/html/nginx\n\nmkdir /var/www/html/apache\n\nAnd put content into each of these folders. It's also worth checking the permissions of each folder are appropriate for the web server to access them.\n2. How do I check to see if Apache has stopped and Nginx has started\nThere's a simple way to check the status of each service. Assuming you're logged in as root:\nservice apache2 stop #Stop apache\nservice apache2 status #is apache still running?\n\nYou can also use the ps command to get the process list:\nps aux | grep -i apache\n\nThis effectively gets all running processes, and searches for any with the name apache.\nYou can then start nginx and check it's running:\nservice nginx start #start nginx\nservice nginx status #is nginx running?\n\n(optionally another way to prove the process is running):\n    ps aux | grep -i nginx\nIt's also possible to see which program is listening on which port:\nnetstat -ntlp\n\nThis will tell you the local address, port, and process name of everything listening for connections on your computer. You should see in this list either nginx or apache running with port 8080 (based on your configuration files) exposed.\n\nA: You are using the same base path for web files (/var/www/html) and that is why the same content is displayed when using nginx or apache.\nThe easiest way to know who is responding to requests is to review the response headers:\ncurl -I 127.0.0.1\nSee what appears in front of Server.\nThis can also be done through the Network or Networking tabs in the developer console of web browsers, look for the value of \"Server\" in the response headers.\n\nA: There can be a scenario where your apache service is stopped but even then what you are seeing is the /var/www/html directory as root and apache webpage. This is because of the directories in nginx - /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ (consists of enabled virtual hosted servers) and /etc/nginx/sites-available/ (consists of available virtual hosted servers). One option is to delete/clean these directories with configuration files and other option is to just comment out the line in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n##\n# Virtual Host Configs\n##\n\ninclude /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;\n\n############Comment out the following line############\n\n#include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\n\n############Comment out the following line############\n\nThen check for the following:\nNginx Configuration Test\nsudo service nginx configtest\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Testing nginx configuration                               [ OK ]\n\n\nor\nsudo nginx -t\n\n\nnginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok\nnginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful\n\n\nRestart Nginx Service\nsudo service nginx restart\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting nginx nginx                                     [ OK ]\n\n\nStatus of Nginx Service\nsudo service nginx status\n\n\n\n*\n\n*nginx is running\n\n\n", "Q: I just lost both wired and wifi network (Ubuntu14.04) Something terrible has happend to my Ubuntu 14.04 installation.

Please help !\n\nA: Since you can ping by ip address, you probably have a DNS issue. \nWhat you can attempt is setting custom DNS server on your Ubuntu machine. My preferred method is adding supersede domain-name-servers xx.xx.xx.xx in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file.\nFor instance, this is excerpt from my /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf. Line numbers added for ease of finding where to place that line:\n    16  #send host-name \"andare.fugue.com\";\n    17  send host-name = gethostname();\n    18  #send dhcp-client-identifier 1:0:a0:24:ab:fb:9c;\n    19  #send dhcp-lease-time 3600;\n    20  #supersede domain-name \"fugue.com home.vix.com\";\n    21  supersede domain-name-servers 208.67.220.220;\n    22  #prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;\n    23  request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,\n    24      domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,\n    25      dhcp6.name-servers, dhcp6.domain-search,\n    26      netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,\n    27      rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers,\n    28      dhcp6.fqdn, dhcp6.sntp-servers;\n    29  #require subnet-mask, domain-name-servers;\n\nWhat does it do ? Basically, when you connect to a router, the machine asks DHCP server on the router to provide it with specific settings, among which is DNS server address. supersede domain-name-server basically means, give me everything else, but replace whatever the router has given me with my own DNS server. In the example above I use openDNS. With that setting, openDSN will be my domain name-server no matter to which network I connect\nOnce you have edited the file, restart network-manager with sudo service network-manager restart\n", "Q: How do I reinstall/change to another linux destribution? My computer currently only has Ubuntu on it and I'd like to change a linux distrubution or reinstall linux\nI know there is an option in windows to return the PC to factory settings, is there a similar option in ubuntu? can I use a boot manager to boot from a USB and then reinstall Ubuntu from there?\n\nA: If your goal is to try different flavor of Ubuntu or different distribution entirely, I suggest you install that in VirtualBox. This will save you trouble on installing-reinstalling, and possibly going back to Ubuntu if you chose so. \nHowever if you insist, here is a general guide on installing different OS on your machine\n\n\n*\n\n*Download *.iso of the desired Linux distribution\n\n*Use Startup Disk Creator or another app of your choice in Ubuntu to create a bootable USB or DVD\n\n*Reboot your machine and on the initial screen with your manufacturer logo, and press the key assigned to changing boot order. Most commonly the button is F12, but depending on your BIOS it may be different. \n\n*Select your installation media as the boot device.\n\n*Follow installation instructions for your desired Linux distro. This should be provided on the distro's website\n\n\nA: What is your intention is a bit unclear for me.From my point of view your intention is to reinstall ubuntu in a clean state. If so you can download ubuntu/any linux and pick a usb and put the ubuntu/linux (You can google about unetBootin) and install via usual way (Going to Bios->Boot Options and set usb as 1st boot device and so on). \n If you want to get rid of unnecessary software and packages you could run the following commands\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nOne of my favorite part in ubuntu or any linux is the way the os keeps the files, normally you'd never want to go for re installation due to bloatware\n", "Q: Sporadic messages output to console after logging in Coming right from a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 Minimal/Netboot (plus some small utilities like acpid, wicd-curses, etc.), after logging in, I occasionally get floating messages (the kind typically seen in the bootup sequence) like the following:\nrandy@leviathan:~$  * Starting AppArmor profiles\nSkipping profile in /etc/apparmor.d/disable: usr.sbin.rsyslog\n\n* Setting up X socket directories...

Typically, you can find them for troubleshooting in /var/log/boot.log after you booted and logged in. Now, it is unclear why you are getting them after logging in, but what you can do is the following workaround: add reset command to the end of your .bashrc file, which will clear and reset the terminal each time you login\n", "Q: ubuntu-device-flash can't find BQ Aquaris 4.5 I tried to reinstall Ubutnu Touch on my BQ Aquaris 4.5.

Can anyone help?\n\nA: It's not clear what you're trying to achieve: What is this .exe file and what does it have to do with updates? .exe files are usually Windows executable files, so I doubt you'll be able to click on it and have it do what you want.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to update all of your packages (applications), \n\n\nA very standard way to do this is to open a terminal (press Ctrl + Alt + T) , type these two commands that use the \"apt-get\" package:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n(You will need to put in an administrative password)\nThere are other ways to update software, but this is probably the most common for ubuntu. Also, depending on your choices on install, the application \"Software & Updates\" should automatically open and tell you when updates are available.\n\n\n*If you want to install new software:\n\n\nYou can use the Ubuntu Software Center App which may be the easiest way if you're not familiar with the command line (click the Dash on the top left, type Ubuntu software, and click on it when it comes up). \nIf you known the name of the program, you can use the terminal again instead:\nsudo apt-get install <program-name>\n\nReplace  with the name of the application/package, like sudo apt-get install firefox.\nIf you have a guess of what the name is but don't remember, like I wanted a package that I know has \"spell\" in the name, you could look for it like this:\nsudo apt-cache search spell\n\nThis will spit out a list of packages that match that search. Keep in mind it's case sensitive.\nAgain, I'm totally guessing that these are your questions. Right now as it stands, I don't think your question makes much sense, so check out my question at the beginning of this answer.\n\nA: If you want to update you can use apt-get:\nFirst you need to update the package sources:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen you need to update the packages:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAnd after that, you need to update your system:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: How do I remove virtualbox.list from etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list I am trying to update software of my Ubuntu 14.04 but there is an error: \nmalformed line /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list (dist) ; access to this source denied.\nE:opening etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list-ifstream::ifstream(13: Permission denied)\nE: List of source could not be read\nE:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.\n\nCould you please help me to remove this virtualbox.list.\nI really appreciate yourhelp.\n\nA: You'll need super-user privileges to delete that file.

How would I add a second and third state (in my code)?\nExec=firejail firefox\n\nand\nExec=firefox\n\n\nA: Limiting/changing your question a bit into \"What are the different sections in a .desktop file for?\"\nExplanation of different sections in a .desktop file\nIn my answer, I will use a simple .desktopfile, since the example of firefox has many distracting lines, not making the answer any clearer. \nThe principle however is exactly the same for all .desktop files, to be used in Unity.\n1. The \"body\" of a basic .desktop file\nSay you have an application (gedit in the example), but no .desktop file. You could simply create a file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Gedit\nExec=gedit\nType=Application\n\nname it e.g. gedit_starter.desktop. To use it from your desktop (double-click to run the command gedit), simply make it executable. To make it appear in Dash, save it in either /usr/share/applications (for global use) or ~/.local/share/applications (for local, personal use).\nAdding extra options (entry keys)\nThe example above is a .desktop file in its simplest form; a simple command, a generic icon. You can add additional lines, to give the .desktop file an icon, add extra options or localized names etc. See this link to find options to add entry keys, such as a customized icon.\nNote that the (possibly set-) icon and the set name (in the Name= line) will not show on the file if you store it on your desktop, unless you make it executable. See below the example of firefox:\nnon-executable\n\nexecutable\n\n2. Adding right-click items (from the Unity Launcher)\n\nThe section, as mentioned in [1.] contains the \"main\" command of the launcher file. This will run if you click on it (Unity). To create right-click items, you need two additional sections:\n\n\n*\n\n*a line, listing those additional right-click options, separated by a \";\". From the \"real\" gedit``.desktop file's example:\nActions=Window;Document;\n\nEach of these items corresponds to:\n\n*a shortcut section, like:\n[Desktop Action Window]\nName=Open a New Window\nExec=gedit --new-window\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nLooking into this section:\n[Desktop Action Window]\n\nrefers to the name, as listed in the Actions= line. The name may contain spaces, e.g.Recently used, as I did in this answer.\nName=Open a New Window\n\nrefers to the name, as it appears in your interface\nExec=gedit --new-window\n\nrefers to the command to run on right-click\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nrefers to the desktop environments that should display the desktop entry\nThat is basically how it works. \nYour example\nIf I understand your question well, and you want to add both Persistent and unsafe to your firefox quicklist (as a right-click option), you'd need to change the line:\nActions=NewWindow;NewPrivateWindow;\n\ninto:\nActions=NewWindow;NewPrivateWindow;Persistant;unsafe;\n\nand add to the bottom of the file two shortcut sections:\n    [Desktop Action Persistant]\n    Name=Persistant\n    Exec=<command>\n    OnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\n\n    [Desktop Action unsafe]\n    Name=unsafe\n    Exec=<command>\n    OnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nwhere you need to replace both <command> by the commands you want it to run.\nNote\nIf you want to edit a .desktopfile, always copy the default (global) file from /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications (for local, personal use), and edit the local one. After log out / in, the local one will overrule the global one.\n\nA: By the way if you do this and then have trouble actually opening links in Firefox (or any program) as a \"default app\" for a filetype, try adding %U to the Exec line, like this:\nExec=firefox %U\n\nThe %U is a placeholder for the URL being passed to the program. I think other placeholders are available as well, this is just what worked for me in Firefox.\n", "Q: ssh client not connecting through public ip I have set up ssh server on my Raspberry pi and forwarded 22 port on router to it.

What does rm -rf do when used to remove files or directories?\nHow do the -r and -f options work together?\n\nA: rm is short for remove. \nThe r flag is to remove directories and their contents recursively and the f means force, and it overrides any confirmation prompts.\n\nA: The command rm -rf is the same as rm -r -f.\nFrom rm's man page (type man rm in a terminal to see it) -r does:\nremove directories and their contents recursively\n\nAnd -f does:\nignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt\n\nSo in combination they do both.\nIn fact it is a very dangerous command because it will recursively remove everything within the directory you choose (or just remove the file you choose), and it will do so without ever prompting you.\nPlease use this command with care!\n\nA: As has already been mentioned, rm -rf <ARG> is meant to forcefully remove files recursively, where <ARG> is a directory ( though it can be a file just fine). \nThe whole point of -r ( recursive removal ) is that rm cannot remove directories if they aren't empty, simply because the underlying system call which rm uses ( unlink ) operates only on empty directories. Thus, what -r flag does, is depth-first search descending into directories and removing files first, and only then when directory is empty - it will remove it. This same effect is achieved via find command with -delete flag (when you don't specify filtering by -type, but that's another story). \nAs for -f, it does two things - one prevents prompting for whether you want to remove the file or not (such as when you are removing a file owned by another user from within your directory, it won't show rm: remove write-protected regular empty file 'f1'? confirmation prompt), and ignores non-existing files. So for instance, with a non-existent file name, you should get rm: cannot remove 'nonexistent': No such file or directory error.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is rm allowed to delete a file under ownership of a different user?\n\n*Doing an rm -rf on a massive directory tree takes hours\n\nA: In addition to the previous correct answer, I would like to teach you how to fish:\nWhen you are not sure about how a command works, what options has and what it does, open a terminal and type\nman <command>\n\nFor example:\nman rm\n\nOnce in there, you can search for the option. A man page can be really long to read, so in the terminal type:\n/<pattern>\n\nSo for example, doing:\n/-f\n\nYou can easily land to:\n-f, --force\n              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt\n\nAfter typing /-r you'll get:\n-r, -R, --recursive\n              remove directories and their contents recursively\n\nYou can move between search results using n (next) and N (previous).\nBonus:\nIf you need to do something, but you don't know the command name, use apropos to search in man pages:\napropos <pattern>\n\nFor example:\napropos directory listing\n\n\nA: Note that in a directory like this\n.\n├── AAA\n│   └── file2.txt\n└── BBB\n    └── AAA\n        └── file1.txt\n\nrunning rm -rf AAA will produce\n.\n└── BBB\n    └── AAA\n        └── file1.txt\n\nIt's always better check on dummy folders with rm if you re not sure 101%.\n", "Q: Compiz on XFCE - I can't login now I have a dual monitor setup.

I tried rebooting afterwards and all I see is a red screen. I don't even see the login screen.\nCan I undo what I just did?\nI used my other machine and SSH'd into the problematic one while exporting X and ran the command xfce4-settings-manager and removed the compiz --replace ccp startup application and rebooted the problematic machine but I still see a red screen.\nI've obviously replaced 'something' with Compiz but I'm not entirely sure what the 'something' is.

This generational conflict caused apt-get to ask the removal of those older packages and attending libraries. \n(Kudos to Sneetsher for pointing me to this.)\nIn the end, I managed to get Paraview, Skype and Google Earth properly installed and functioning after having run apt-get -f install, that is a general overhaul of broken dependencies. I did so on suggestion of apt-get itself. \n\n*However, while apt-get -f install was tending to its task, I noticed that some applications were disappearing from the desktop menu. I considered this natural, hence I moved on to reinstalling those. The installation of Banshee as first go went well (I can't recall whether using apt-get or dpkg). With Brasero came the fun. \n\n*After commanding apt-get install brasero, apt-get asks me to remove another large number of libraries, in the order of hundreds. Mistakenly I consider those applications to add and give my go ahead. At the end of this spree of autoimmune exuberance, the first evidence is that the browser cannot connect to URLs any longer -- thus the internet connectivity is knocked off. I then give the reboot a chance. The system goes through the POST seamlessly, then it hangs on the Ubuntu splash screen.\n\n*Cutting the long story short, I managed to reboot in recovery mode and get to a responsive command line terminal. As the POST rolls through its checks, I can see that it fails on starting LightDM Display Manager (but maybe somewhere else that I miss).\n\n\nNow the state of the play from the recovery-mode command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*ping yields a 'user unknown' \n\n*xterm yields a 'display is not set'\n\n*both lightdm and gdm yield a 'currently not installed'\n\n*dpkg-reconfigure lightdm yields a 'broken or not fully installed'\n\n*apt-get install lightdm gives a streak of 'failed to fetch' arguably because the internet has been cut out (checked out that the cable is in place)\n\n*I can see the external drives though! \n\n\nHence I was thinking to circumvent the internet cut-out by saving a bridgehead of deb files on one of those drives and then running dpkg or apt-get on them from the command line. Clearly, I am not so much in favour of reinstalling the whole OS.\nDoes it make sense to you?\nIf it does, the questions are\n\n\n*\n\n*Which packages and dependencies would be able to restore the internet connection?\n\n*Since the dependencies could easily be in the order of tens if not hundreds, is there a place where these are conveniently zipped/tarred in a single bundle? Of course I can't rely on remote fetching.\n\n*Say I manage to restore the internet connectivity, then I will be able to fetch the remote repositories. Which commands should I run to make sure that all 'broken pieces' are rescued and restored?\n\n*Why on Earth did Brasero needed to remove 100+ library packages of essential nature? This seems truly excessive to me!\n\n\nThanks for having patiently read this long post.

They show only 1 solution and (except apt-get) don't show the architecture of each package.\nIf you face any conflict, use aptitude. It shows other solutions and shows clearly all packages from all available architecture.\n\n*If you have to install some i386 tools with no option for amd64. Leave them to be installed the last. If you have them already installed and you are trying to install native arch amd64 packages then you get a conflict (basically unmet dependencies message). Let aptitude uninstalls the i386 ones, then run clean up with apt-get autoremove to remove residues (auto-installed dependencies from i386 arch). Install amd64 packages you wanted then try installing back the removed i386 tools.\nWhy is that? If you try to install a i386 tool, all its dependencies will be installed as i386 too, even amd64 ones available and can work. Later, if you try to install another amd64 tool which have at least one overlapped dependency, you get the conflict.\nAptitude will seem like removing the packages, but actually it is replacing some i386 packages with the corresponding amd64 ones.\nSee this show case, Ubuntu 14.04, problem when install gstreamer1.0-libav, unmet dependencies\n", "Q: Can I run Windows online games on Ubuntu?

I've never experienced any problems related to the size of my EFI partition.\nWhy therefore, is the official minimum size 100MB?

I have a Win 7 partition, an Ubuntu partition, and a data partition. Both Win 7 and Ubuntu access the data partition successfully. Ubuntu handles the boot choice between Win 7 and Ubuntu.\nBefore I installed Ubuntu, I used Veracrypt for full disk encryption (FDE). I travel with this laptop and I want to be absolutely sure that if it's lost or stolen my data can't be accessed.\nI've been reading about how to resume using Veracrypt for FDE and I'm not sure I can do that anymore. Specifically, I want to enter the Veracrypt boot first, and then arrive at a screen that lets me choose between Win 7 and Ubuntu. Is there a way to do that?\nI'm not seeing anything that says that's possible. It looks like I should use Veracrypt to encrypt the Win 7 partition and the data partition but use Ubuntu to encrypt its own partition. Is that correct?\nHere's what I think I need to do. Am I correct?\n1 - Remove Ubuntu so I can reload it differently.\n2 - Restore the Win 7 boot loader so the system works as it did before I installed Ubuntu. (How do I do this?)\n3 - Reinstall Ubuntu (Using an Alternate install?) and place it's boot loader on the same partition as Ubuntu, not in the laptop's MBR. Also have Ubuntu encrypt it's own partition at the same time.\nAt this point, I should be able to turn on my laptop and see the Veracrypt Boot Loader. To log into Windows I should enter the Veracrypt password. To boot into Ubuntu I should press ESC which will send me to the Ubuntu loader and ask me for Ubuntu's decrypt password.\nI'm not sure how the data partition would be accessible via each operating system, but I think I just need to re-read the right posts OR ask that in a separate post.\nThanks,\nBob\n\nA: \n1 - Remove Ubuntu so I can reload it differently.\n\nThat depends on how different. You could use only home folder encryption (PAM & ecryptfs) if that is sufficient for you (it obviously is good enough to land in the next version of Android) and avoid reinstalling. Alternatively you could also encrypt your home partition and mount it during login (PAM & LUKS).\n\n2 - Restore the Win 7 boot loader\n\nThis was answered here: How to create or recover Windows Bootloader after deleting Ubuntu boot drive\nIdeally you should get rid of MBR and its limitations (and therefore Windows 7), but a UEFI loader for Veracrypt may still take a while to develop and release. Using one hard drive for each OS is always the best option, no matter if booting MBR or UEFI\nIt's possible to chainload an image of the Truecrypt MBR loader in Grub to boot Windows and loading Veracrypt MBR should be possible too. (How do I get Grub2 to boot a Truecrypt-encrypted MBR? Remember to always backup your headers, some solutions even make use of backed up headers and rescue images.)\nSo this would be my suggestion for MBR with one HDD and 3-4 primary partitions (try to avoid extended partitions):\n\n\n*\n\n*Grub installed by Ubuntu for OS selection\n\n\n*\n\n*boot unencrypted Ubuntu Root\n\n\n*\n\n*encrypted home with LUKS or ecryptfs (PAM_mount)\n\n\n*boot chainloaded Veracrypt Windows\n\n\n\n\nRelated: Is there a reason to use TrueCrypt over VeraCrypt?\n", "Q: Is it possible to create a virtual host on a virtual machine?

The desktop is not fully loaded yet ans the command cannot be run.\nAdd to your Startup Applications a break before the script starts, and it will run fine:\n\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && python2 /path/to/script.py\"\n\nI tested your script both with and without the break, and indeed failed if I ran it without, but succeeded with the break.\nA few remarks\n\n*\n\n*Be aware that if you don't use the shebang (#!/usr/bin/env python) you must precede the path to the script by python to run it. No matter if it is executable or not.\n\n\n*On slower systems (or on a VM) , the break of 15 seconds might not be sufficient. If so try to start with a relatively long break, experimenting \"down\" to the limit.\n\n\n*About the script; didn't really look into it, but I definitely wouldn't use os.system any more, use subprocess.Popen() instead, and oh, you can save a line by removing the first os.system(to_send) and un- indent the second one, since you will run the command in both cases after the if / else route . :)\n", "Q: Install mooshak 1.6.2 in ubuntu 14.04 I am trying to install mooshak to host a programming contest in my server.

I don't know which folder was affected, so I have changed everything back to root ownership, but realise I will never get things back to normal (even if I found a good guide in the first answer here). I now want to backup my files onto USB before I reinstall Ubuntu, but can't get to my USB ports. Have followed these instructions and it looks like Ubuntu is recognising the USB ports, so I guess it has to do with the permissions/ownership problems (as everything has gone haywire with the machine and I guess also the USB ports are affected).\nI have tried running the following to find what I need to change to get things working again:\nsudo find /usr -exec stat -c '%U %n' {} + | grep -v root\n\nBut I don't know what permissions/ownerships I need to change specifically to get the USB working. /media/ should be owned by root according to another machine I have, and it is, so I guess it must be something else. Any ideas? (I'm sorry to have to ask this kind of thing - I guess it is what comes from experimenting too much with too little knowledge)\n\nA: If you have destroyed the ownership and permissions throughout the systems, chances are that the automatic mechanism for mounting the USB drive are busted. \nYou have two possibilities --- and I would go with the first if you are not an experienced Unix user: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use a Live disk. Boot from it and choose not to install (\"check Ubuntu without installing\" or something similar). \nOnce in the Live session, use File Explorer to mount your main disk (again, I do not remember the exact procedure, but it's not difficult), insert your USB disk, and backup your files. Maybe you will need to use sudo if your UID is different from the standard one; but you have a full system working and shouldn't be difficult. \n\n*Manually backing up your home directory from a root shell --- notice that this is a dangerous process. \nIn this case, you drop to a root shell (sudo -i or equivalent) and the insert your USB drive. Although it will not be automounted, you should see in the system log /var/log/syslog something like this: \n[...]\nSYS: Sep  6 12:13:27 samsung-romano kernel: [43555.542311] sd 6:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg2 type 0\nSYS: Sep  6 12:13:27 samsung-romano kernel: [43555.542606] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] 1957888 512-byte logical blocks: (1.00 GB/956 MiB)\n[...]\n\nThe important part is the sdb --- this is how the device is known to the system. You can mount it manually; let's do it under for example /mnt:\nmkdir -p /mnt\nmount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\n\n(normally USB drives are partitioned with just one partition. The above command should work 99% of  the times). \nNow you have the USB drive under /mnt. You can copy thing there as root (remember to use cp -a to maintain ownerships and modes) or using tar or whatever. Or you can change the mount point  to your normal user and do the copy as your user. \nAnyway, check your backup in anther machine before reinstalling everything. And notice that recent Ubuntu do allows a new installation without touching your /home --- although a backup is always recommended. \n", "Q: how to permanantly install arduino ide 1.6.5?

By default this is done by gpg-agent, but there are other tools implementing a subset of its functionality. These instructions are for gpg-agent only. If you use an agent like gnome-keyring, seahorse-agent or the KDE Wallet Manager, then these instructions don't apply.\nMost common Problem\nSymptoms\nThe most common issue is that gpg-agent (a part of GnuPG) cannot launch pinentry (the tool used to query your passphrase). Enigmail would display messages like:\nwhen reading messages:\nError - no matching private/secret key found to decrypt message; click on 'Details' button for more information\n\nwhen sending messages:\n- Send operation aborted. Error - encryption command failed\n- Send operation aborted. Key 0x....... not found or not valid. The (sub-)key might have expired\n\nHow to Analyze\nTry sending a signed and unencrypted message to yourself.\nCheck the output in the Enimgail log: go to menu Enigmail > Debugging Options > View Log.\nSearch for the following text: parseErrorOutput: status message. You will probably find this message several times. Check what follows below.\nIf the message says something like \"no pinentry\", \"problem with the agent\", \"Invalid IPC response\" or \"problem with gpg-agent\", then there is something wrong with your gpg-agent and/or pinentry setup.\n\nHow to Fix it\nExecute the following script from a terminal to find out if a graphical version of pinentry is used:\n\npinentry <<EOT\nSETDESC Hello World\nCONFIRM\nEOT\n\nYou should get a graphical window with a confirmation message \"Hello World\". If a \"window\" is opened within your terminal window then pinentry is text-based, which does not work with Enigmail. To fix this, ensure that a graphical version of pinentry is installed. On Linux/Unix systems, these would typically be pinentry-qt/pinentry-qt4 or pinentry-gtk/pinentry-gtk2, and on Mac OS X pinentry-mac. Rename the existing pinentry file to \"pinentry-text\" or similar, and create a symlink from pinentry-qt, pinentry-qt4, pinentry-gtk, pinentry-gtk2 or pinentry-mac to pinentry. Then restart your PC.\n\nIf the above does not help, check the contents of $HOME/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf. Make sure that there is a configuration entry pinentry-program containing the full path to a graphical version of pinentry as above. E.g.:\n\npinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-gtk\n\nThen save the file and restart your PC.\n\nIf you still can't access your key, then execute the following script from a terminal:\n\ngpg-connect-agent <<EOT\nGETINFO version\nEOT\n\nThe output should be something like the text below, where 2.0.26 represents the agent version number. The version number should match your gpg version number:\n\nD 2.0.26\nOK\n\nIf you get an error message like \"ERR 280 not implemented\" then you don't use gpg-agent, but one of the alternatives like gnome-keyring. We recommend you switch to gpg-agent by disabling your current agent. See e.g. askubuntu for how to disable gnome-keyring or how to disable KDE wallet.\n\nIf you get a useful result from above, then execute the following script from a terminal:\n\ngpg-connect-agent <<EOT\nGET_CONFIRMATION Hello\nEOT\n\nPinentry should now open as a graphical window (just like above), with the difference to the step above that this instance of pinentry was launched from gpg-agent. If this is successful, then GnuPG 2 should work correctly in Enigmail.\n\nIf gpg-agent still cannot launch pinentry from Enigmail, then you need to start debugging gpg-agent. Execute the following commands from a terminal:\n\nkillall gpg-agent\ngpg-agent --debug-level expert --use-standard-socket --daemon /bin/sh\n\nThis will start gpg-agent from the command line, open a new shell and print the debug output to that shell. If the command succeeded, you will see somehting like:\ngpg-agent[76979]: gpg-agent 2.0.26 started\nLeave the terminal window untouched, start Thunderbird and try to use Enigmail. As you'll try to access gpg-agent, you will see the output in your terminal window. If gpg-agent cannot start pinentry successfully, you will see something like this:\n\ngpg-agent[76993]: starting a new PIN Entry\ngpg-agent[76993]: chan_19 <- ERR 67109133 can't exec `/usr/bin/pinentry': No such file or directory\ngpg-agent[76993]: chan_19 -> BYE\ngpg-agent[76993]: can't connect to the PIN entry module: IPC connect call failed\ngpg-agent[76993]: command get_passphrase failed: No pinentry\n\nPress Ctrl+D in the terminal to end the debugging session. The bold line should tell you the reason for the error (in the example above, pinentry cannot be found). Try to fix the error and repeat the test.\"\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, but found that killing gpg-agent was a workround.\n(From the source code I found that you can enable enigmail logging by editing the \"defaults/preferences/enigmail.js\" file somewhere under ~/.thunderbird, setting the \"extensions.enigmail.logDirectory\" property to \"/tmp\". The log file \"/tmp/enigdbug.txt\" then showed the full gpg command that enigmail was running, ending with \"--use-agent\". I ran that gpg command from the command-line, feeding it an encrypted email message. It complained with the error message \"gpg: problem with the agent: No PINentry\". Googling for that error message turned up the suggestion to kill the gpg-agent. Meanwhile, the NSA rubs its hands in glee that the user experience of PKI encryption is so rubbish.)\n\nA: I had a similar problem. Thunderbird was asking again and again to put in my key's password and Gnome keyring wouldn't remember it, although I asked it to. The problem was, that gpg-agent wasn't running in my session. The problem vanished when I manually started it in the current session with:\ngpg-agent --debug-level expert --use-standard-socket --daemon /bin/sh\n\nTo solve the problem permanently you have to assure, that the agent is running in your session:\n1. Check you have the following file /etc/X11/Xsession.d/90gpg-agent. Mine looks like this:\n  : ${GNUPGHOME=$HOME/.gnupg}\n\n  GPGAGENT=/usr/bin/gpg-agent\n  PID_FILE=\"$GNUPGHOME/gpg-agent-info-$(hostname)\"\n\n  if grep -qs '^[[:space:]]*use-agent' \"$GNUPGHOME/gpg.conf\" \"$GNUPGHOME/options\" &&\n     test -x $GPGAGENT &&\n     { test -z \"$GPG_AGENT_INFO\" || ! $GPGAGENT 2>/dev/null; }; then\n\n     if [ -r \"$PID_FILE\" ]; then\n         . \"$PID_FILE\"\n     fi\n\n     # Invoking gpg-agent with no arguments exits successfully if the agent\n     # is already running as pointed by $GPG_AGENT_INFO\n     if ! $GPGAGENT 2>/dev/null; then\n         STARTUP=\"$GPGAGENT --daemon --sh --write-env-file=$PID_FILE $STARTUP\"\n     fi\n  fi\n\n\n\n*Check you have the file ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf, with at least the following line:\nuse-agent\n\nIf not, you can add it with the following command:\necho \"use-agent\" >>  ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf \n\n\nA: Got the same error error about pinentry. At the end, I figured out that the gpg-agent was using the wrong pinentry. Solved it by setting the right pinentry by editing ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf and adding the following line\npinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-gtk-2\n\nDefault for the system I'm working at was pinentry-x11(it's an company wide installation which allows a variety of window managers), which did not work for gnome3. - So one has to make sure that the gpg-agent is using the correct pinentry for the actual window manager in use.\n\nA: In my case it was just that I didn't have any pinentry tools except for pinentry-curses (command line with pointer support). So in Fedora install any of these passphrase/PIN entry dialogs:\n\n\n*\n\n*pinentry-qt.x86_64 based on Qt4;\n\n*pinentry-gtk.x86_64 based on GTK+;\n\n*pinentry-emacs.x86_64 for emacs;\n\n*pinentry-gnome3.x86_64 for GNOME 3.\n\n\nI used the GNOME 3 pinentry package.\n\nA: In thunderbird, select the message, click on the hamburger, expand the Enigmail menu and select decrypt/verify. You'll get a password prompt after which the message will be decrypted.\n\nA: I had a similar problem!\nFollowing the gpg-agent debug done with:\ngpg-agent --debug-level expert --use-standard-socket --daemon /bin/sh\n\nI found out that something was broken between enigmail and gpg and it never asked for a passphrase.\nBut in the case the passphrase was pre-loaded all worked perfectly.\nIn my case the problem what that, in the past, I forced the follow option in the ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf\npinentry-mode loopback\n\nThis broke the process. You can check the command that enigmail is running enabling the expert mode in Enigmail and then in \"Debugging Options --> View Console\"\nCommented and everything worked.\n\nA: I had the same problem with Ubuntu Budgie 18.04.

When I have Windows installed and want to do a dual boot, I will click Continue in that box, I will install Ubuntu but then I would loose Windows (it happens even if I have partitions set and changed as they should be when dual booting).\nI tried to look in BIOS and changed a few settings to Legacy instead of UEFI mode, but no luck :-(\nWhat can I do? Where is the problem? \nI have an ASUS motherboard, AMD 6100 6-core CPU, AMD R7 GPU (if this helps).\nBtw, the same thing happens if I want to install Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Gnome...\nThank you for all your answers.\nGod bless you.\nSCREENSHOT LINK:\n\n\nA: It sounds like you've got a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode installation of Windows, but the Ubuntu installer is booting in EFI/UEFI mode. Proceeding with an EFI-mode installation of Ubuntu would likely reach a certain point but then fail. Repairing it at that point would be possible, but only if you know more than you clearly do.\nThe simplest solution is probably to force your Ubuntu installation medium to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. This can usually be done by using the firmware's built-in boot manager, which is usually accessed by hitting Esc or some function key at boot time. In the boot manager, there are likely to be two entries for your boot medium, one of which includes the string \"UEFI\" and the other of which doesn't. Select the boot option that lacks the \"UEFI\" string. Alternatively, it may be possible to create an Ubuntu installation USB that lacks the EFI boot loader file, although the details of how to do this vary from one method of writing the USB drive to another.\nStepping back further, IMHO a better way to solve the problem is to re-install everything (both Windows and Ubuntu), but this time in EFI mode. Most modern computers are based on EFI firmware and provide a BIOS compatibility layer (aka a CSM or legacy support) to support older BIOS-mode boot loaders. This feature can usually be disabled in the firmware setup utility, which is desirable because it greatly simplifies the boot process. I describe this issue in more detail on this page, if you're interested in looking into it. Although the emphasis of that page is on the perils of installing Linux in BIOS mode when the computer already has an EFI-mode Windows installation, the principles are the same in your case, just with reversed boot modes for the two OSes. OTOH, disabling the CSM to simplify the boot process means that you'll have to either re-install Windows or jump through hoops to convert it to boot in EFI mode. If you try this and re-install Windows, your best bet is to completely erase the partition table on the disk before you begin the re-installation.\n\nA: If the computer came with Microsoft Windows pre-installed. Go into you Bios and try installing in CSM boot mode. From what I understand any device pre-installed with Windows is made to have only windows on the UEFI partition, as to preserve the OEM product key Microsoft instills into your UEFI Firmware.\n", "Q: Deleted Ubuntu prtition from machine and going back to Win - can't get past \"grub rescue\" on startup I wanted to go back to an all Windows machine after trying Ubuntu 15.04. It was a good experiment, but not for me.\nI had installed Ubuntu 15.04 on its own partition and it put in a dual boot menu. At start-up I chose either Ubuntu or Win 7.\nAfter making the decision to delete Ubuntu, I went into the Disk Manager in Windows and used the Delete Volume command to free up the space. That left me with all free space where I had Ubuntu.\nWhen I rebooted thinking I would go straight to windows, I get the \"grub rescue >\" command and can't figure out what to do to get back into Windows.\nI have read several of the other fixes in this forum, but they all seem to be aimed at recovering the Ubuntu partition and not to getting past the rescue screen and back to Windows.\nAny assistance will be appreciated.\n\nA: First, an insight to your problem: the default installation of Ubuntu would set the boot loader to the Ubuntu partition grub. When you delete the partition you have deleted the boot code along with it. \nSolution: Repair Windows loader and set it as the boot loader.

However after a few days the drive again is inaccessible.\nAny ideas what is causing this? \nThanks in advance,\nJoe\n\nA: You might start Ubuntu without properly shutdown the windows. If you are restarting and switch to windows to Ubuntu cause problem . similarly hibernate also like that so better if you try to switch to Ubuntu, then let the PC shutdown and give a little time then start with Ubuntu. Because file system of Windows is NTFS in Ubuntu its different so your operating system may confuse this student transformations.\n\nA: It seems that you have not turned off fast startup option in windows.\nFast Startup (a.k.a Hybrid Boot or Hybrid Shutdown) is turned on by default in Windows. \nTo turn it off : Go to Control Panel > Power options > Choose what the power buttons do  And the uncheck the Turn on fast startup option.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: dual boot ubuntu 14.04 and WIN10 share NTFS problem same as described above:\n1-Enter Win10 and open a cmd prompt as admin. \n2-Change to shared disk partition (slice). \n3-Run \"chkdsk\"\n4- \"shutdown\" or \"restart\" and select Ubuntu from dual boot.\nShould work now.\nI had this problem when I did a Word 2013 save on the data slice.\nI re-saved the file from WIN10 Word 2013. Problem disappeared.\nNext time I used the \"chkdsk\" method. It reports no errors, but resets \"something\" that allows mount to work in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: ACPI open/close lid scripts - xrandr does not execute but other commands do See SOLUTION at the end.\nI have used this guide to write a script that activates when I open or close the laptop lid. My setup is a laptop monitor and an external monitor working well together.\nBasically (everything works fine the first 3 steps, the confusion starts on step 4):\n1) I have created the ~/export_x_info file about permission issues and running it on startup containing:\n# Export the dbus session address on startup so it can be used by any other environment\nsleep 5\ntouch $HOME/.Xdbus\nchmod 600 $HOME/.Xdbus\nenv | grep DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS > $HOME/.Xdbus\necho 'export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS' >> $HOME/.Xdbus\n# Export XAUTHORITY value on startup so it can be used by cron\nenv | grep XAUTHORITY >> $HOME/.Xdbus\necho 'export XAUTHORITY' >> $HOME/.Xdbus\n\n2) I created /etc/acpi/lid.sh pointing to the actual script on my home directory containing these two lines:\n#!/bin/bash\n/home/myname/scripts/lid_event\n\n3) On the lid_event I put the following:\ngrep -q closed /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state\nif [ $? = 0 ]\nthen\n    /home/myname/scripts/close;\nelse\n    /home/myname/scripts/open;\nfi\n\nUntil now everything is as expected. I have checked the \"/proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state\" file and changes depending on lid being open or closed. All files I have created are executable so there is no problem there.\n4) On my \"close\" script I have this (\"open\" script is similar so no need to mention it):\n #This runs so that root can run the following command under the user's environment\nsource /home/myname/.Xdbus\n\n#When laptop lid closes, close laptop screen.\nDISPLAY=:0.0 su myname -c xrandr --output eDP1 --off\n\nWhen I close the lid I want the laptop screen to close and have only the VGA screen up. The above command works great when manually executing it at the terminal or manually executing this script but when it's about ACPI it does not execute!\nNow, the weird thing is if I put a simple command like \"touch ~/file\" on the above script, it executes perfectly!\nIt seems to be a specific problem with xrandr. I suspect that there might be some permission issues unresolved but I cannot find a solution.\n\nA: SOLUTION \nIt seems that the info on the ubuntu community is not complete. You need to make one more step in order to work. According to this, you additionally need to create /etc/acpi/events/lm_lid and put:\nevent=button/lid.*\naction=/etc/acpi/lid.sh\n\nNow it works fine for me. I have updated the Ubuntu guide so you can safely follow the guide here\n\nA: You need to quote the command that su is to run so it is one string:\nDISPLAY=:0.0 su myname -c 'xrandr --output eDP1 --off'\n\n", "Q: Popcorn Time stuck in apt-get So I'm just coming back to Ubuntu after some time away, running 14.04 and I've gotten things customized the way I like them, more or less.

Can we find out the software components which are currently resident in the memory. If yes, how?\nAny command to find the software components?\n\nA: Your question seems to assume that your application is either completely in memory or not. But this is not the case. There are different types of data loaded for an application and all are handled slightly differently:\n\n\n*\n\n*the binary of the application\n\n*shared libraries needed by the application\n\n*space allocated by your application for data\n\n*memory mapped files allocated by your application\n\n\nNevertheless, at any point in time it is mostly at the descretion of the Linux kernel to decide what is actually in memory and what not. Loading data into memory is typically done in pages of 4096 bytes, so even each of 1 to 4 above may be in memory only partly.\nThe total size of what is in memory for your process is called resident set size, typically called RSS. When you run htop or top or ps it is the column RES or RSS that contains the information you want.\nI must admit, however, that I am not sure if shared libraries are counted into it or whether they are separated out in the SHR (for shared) column.\n", "Q: Install a program on Ubuntu I have a problem with installing programs and apps.\nFor example I download a program for Ubuntu, mount it with Furius ISO Mount then I tray with terminal and\nsudo apt-get install nxnsetup\n\nand it show me next:\nReading package lists...

How do I do this? \n\nA: The short answer is, you don't. There's no need for you to be manually creating directories in system paths, or to change the permissions of any of the folders or files in those paths.\nIf there is some specific problem you are having, which results in you thinking this action is appropriate, then you are likely hitting a bug, or trying to do something wrong based on bad information. Please ask a question instead about the specific issue you're trying to resolve with this course of action you're attempting to take, to get better answers.\n\nA: I will assume that you created a few partitions with Gparted, and you are not able to access them since the owner is root.\nI had this problem myself and accidentally found a painless workaround.\nUnmount partition, open Disks from dash, click the desired partition, then click the little gears > more actions > edit filesystem... and give it a new name.

Is there a way through which I can make the sudo command give me permissions for a longer period than its default time?\nIt can be a pain having to keep entering the sudo password, when requiring the installation of many packages, so it would be nice if there exists a command or configuration that can be done to affect it usage period.\n\nA: Try this .\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the following command in a Terminal:\nsudo visudo\n\n\n*Scroll down to the line that looks like this:\nDefaults        env_reset\n\n\n*Change it to for example: \nDefaults        env_reset,timestamp_timeout=30\n\nChange 30 to the time, in minutes, that you want it to wait before it times out.

The \"-s\" switch gives you a console with root permissions, that last until you exit it. No need to hazle around with the default settings.\n\nA: After seeing one too many questions from users who modified config files and were confused about why their changes were overwritten after a package upgrade, I'll note that if you want to modify timestamp_timeout, it is better to do it by creating a file in /etc/sudoers.d rather than modify /etc/sudoers directly.\nSo you should do\nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/timeout\n\n(the name of the file can be whatever you want as long as it does not contain a period (.) nor end with a tilde (~)). Instead of opening /etc/sudoers in your editor of choice, it will open /etc/sudoers.d/timeout, normally as an empty file since it does not exist. Put your\nDefaults timestamp_timeout=X\n\nin it, and save as usual. Then if a new version of /etc/sudoers comes out, you don't have to choose between installing the newer version or keeping your changes--you will automatically have both.\n\nA: Behavior of sudo is configured in /etc/sudoers file.

You can change this value in /etc/sudoers.\nYou don't directly edit /etc/sudoers, instead use visudo to do it.\nFrom man visudo:\n     visudo edits the sudoers file in a safe fashion, analogous to vipw(8).\n     visudo locks the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits, pro‐\n     vides basic sanity checks, and checks for parse errors.  If the sudoers\n     file is currently being edited you will receive a message to try again\n     later.\n\nSo, type sudo visudo in a terminal, which will open the /etc/sudoers file in nano text-editor. \nLook for this line:\nDefaults    env_reset\n\nAnd add timestamp_timeout=X  where X is the time you want to set in minutes.\nSo as an example:\nDefaults    env_reset,timestamp_timeout=5\n\nIf you specify 0, you will always be asked the password. If you specify a negative value, the timeout will never expire.\nOnce done, save and exit.\nSee RootSudoTimeout\n\nA: All of the other answers so far seem to center around changing the default timeout for how long before you have to type your password again with sudo.

First time I tried to install Ubuntu, I had some problems and I found out that the GPT table was corrupt. So, I fixed it, using the command sudo gdisk /dev/sda option w. Then I started the installation, but it suddenly stopped working, it was towards the end. Apparently, it is a bug in GRUB, the following information was given:\nProblemType: Bug\nDistroRelease: Ubuntu 15.04\nPackage: ubiquity 2.21.25 [modified: lib/partman/automatically_partition/question]\nProcVersionSignature: Ubuntu 3.19.0-15.15-generic 3.19.3\nUname: Linux 3.19.0-15-generic x86_64\nNonfreeKernelModules: wl\nApportVersion: 2.17.2-0ubuntu1\nArchitecture: amd64\nCasperVersion: 1.360\nDate: Sun Sep 6 00:17:48 2015\nInstallCmdLine: BOOT_IMAGE=/casper/vmlinuz.efi file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed cdrom-detect/try-usb=true noprompt floppy.allowed_drive_mask=0 ignore_uuid boot=casper quiet splash ---\nLiveMediaBuild: Ubuntu 15.04 \"Vivid Vervet\" - Release amd64 (20150422)\nProcEnviron:\n LANGUAGE=es_EC.UTF-8\n PATH=(custom, no user)\n LANG=es_EC.UTF-8\n SHELL=/bin/bash\nSourcePackage: grub-installer\nUpgradeStatus: No upgrade log present (probably fresh install)\n\nHow can I fix it ?\n\nA: Your corrupt partition table must have had a cause, and that cause might be related to your subsequent problem of a failed GRUB installation. For instance, if the disk is failing, that could affect both the partition table and the GRUB installation; or if the partition table appeared to be damaged because of inconsistent RAID configurations across your OSes, that could also affect GRUB installation. Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell, given the information you've provided, what the cause of the partition table trouble was, so I can't offer any solutions that would be more than shots in the dark. It's also possible that these issues are unrelated -- for instance, some other tool might have damaged the partition table, and that would be unlikely to have any effect on a later GRUB installation. Thus, my first recommendation is to be aware of this issue and alert to future partition table troubles. If a problem recurs, get help. You might also run a SMART test on the disk, just as a precautionary measure.\nI don't see anything in the information you posted that really helps diagnose your GRUB problem, so that's also a shot-in-the-dark sort of situation. I can, however, suggest a possible way to get moving again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from same.\n\n*If you haven't done so already, disable Secure Boot on your computer.\n\n*Boot to rEFInd. With any luck, it will show options to boot Ubuntu.\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu using rEFInd. (If there are multiple Ubuntu boot options, try each one until one works or until you've exhausted all the options.)\n\n*If you can get Ubuntu booted, you can proceed with further diagnostics and/or attempt to install a boot loader. You can try to manually install GRUB or install the rEFInd Debian package or PPA.\n\n\nIf you continue to have problems, post back with details. (Edit your original question or create a new one.) Cut-and-pasted error messages, or screen shots of the same, may be helpful. The output of sudo parted -l may also be helpful.\n", "Q: Laptop gets unexpected hard resets when using apt-get I am not able to install any software or update my packages anymore. A sudden reset happens everytime apt-get (upgrade, install or autoremove) finishes downloading and (apparently) right after grub comes in action.\nMy laptop is an Asus G750 with Windows 8 pre-installed on the HDD (which I barely use) and Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS installed on an SSD (which I use frequently and I am using now).\nI have screen-captured the exact moment when the system resets. These results are after executing sudo apt-get autoremove.\n\nNote that I used to have this problem before and at some point I could not boot into Ubuntu anymore, therefore I reconfigured my HDD and installed another Ubuntu to perform backups. After that I wiped out my entire SSD and installed a fresh Ubuntu (however the older Ubuntu still stays in the HDD and apparently the laptop resets after grub finds it on sdb9). The problem still remains in the new freshly installed Ubuntu. Is it because Ubuntu is residing on SSD? Or is it because grub cannot handle multiple OSs on different hard drives?\nWhat is causing this? And is there any way to force grub to skip scanning the other HDD after every apt-get?\n\nA: What you see in that photograph is not a system reset (or reboot), it is just the output of the command update-grub.\nWhen installing or removing packages, sometimes additional actions are required to properly setup or clean up the environment.\nThe process of installation and removal for kernel packages always runs update-grub to generate a new GRUB configuration file. You can run it manually, it's harmless:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n\nI am not able to install any software or update my packages anymore\n\nThere's not enough information to say anything about that. Maybe it's related to what we can see in the first line of the photograph: \"1 not fully installed or removed\". You have to provide more information (the command you ran and its full output).\n", "Q: MKV seek broken after re-encoding I have a few MKV files that need the title to be changed.

Yes, the  old story: Trying to create an image of a partition to save in a different location... the accident is/was cloning to an external drive  instead of the intended location and now the external drive has lost its structure and data. \nI was trying to make an image of a partition and save it to an external hard drive. I (somewhat) followed the directions on this post: Cloning with DD command  while also using these and other commands such as  dd if=/dev/sda1 of=~/disk2.img  but my attempt was a big fail not to mention a lost of my hard drive. \nAfter I typed the command,  dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/(forgot the drive here) repeatedly and with different parameters, I  realized the destination was wrong. Even worst,  in the process of copying I thought I had stopped it by pressing Control + C then I unplugged the drive. I was wrong.\nNow my external drive  is screwed up. It is not being recognized by Linux or other OSs. Linux gives me an error when plugging the h.d. in. See image below. \nSo, can the cloning be undone or do I have to opt for data recovery?\nIs my hard drive ruined?\nAlthough this error was not my intention, an answer on this post makes me think this is what happened to my drive. \n\n\nA: Not really.\nCloning writes raw blockdata to your drive, making it extremely hard to recover information if you choose a bad path.\nThat said, you might be able to send it off to a professional data recovery team, but that's expensive and there's no guarantee that it'll work.\n\nTo recover your drive to a usable state, simply open up GParted or your Disk utility and create a new partition on your drive.\nRecovering data itself might be possible in very rare conditions, if by some miracle you stopped the clone before it reached into a second partition. If this is the case, you'd just have to rebuild the partition tables in their exact position. Unfortunately, this is harder than it looks and is usually impossible.\nFinally, there have been some reports of photorec working, but that isn't the norm. YMMV.\ndd is very often and aptly referred to as Disk Destroyer. Take extra care when using that command.\n", "Q: slow touchpad sensitivity I have recently installed Ubuntu 15.04.

Looking more closely at the error in your original question, the error says it needs libegl1-mesa OR libegl1-x11, and your error in the comment indicates that the package libegl1-x11 wasn't found in the repository, so instead of installing every package they list in the error, we'll try to install packages selectively, since some packages automatically include the other packages you need:\nsudo apt-get install unity-control-center libegl1-mesa libgbm1;\n\nAnd try upgrading again.\nsudo apt-get update;\nsudo apt-get upgrade;\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade;\n\n(I'm frankly not sure if running \"upgrade\" before \"dist-upgrade\" will make a difference, but it shouldn't hurt)\n", "Q: What does 'exec' do? I recently meant to run the command pkexec, but accidentally managed to run the command exec by itself with no options or arguments. I looked in the man pages for the description of exec, but I still have no idea what it means:\nDESCRIPTION\n       The  exec() family of functions replaces the current process image with\n       a new process image.  The functions described in this manual  page  are\n       front-ends  for execve(2).  (See the manual page for execve(2) for fur‐\n       ther details about the replacement of the current process image.)\n\nAnd actually the description goes on... But the rest of the description didn't help me very much either... So this is really my question, what does the exec command do? And did I do anything by just executing it by itself with no options or arguments, just as exec? Does it have any relation to the pkexec command?\n\nA: \"exec() family of functions\" ... are, well, functions. They are used in source code. They are not commands to be executed by users1. They are typically used by programs which need to execute another (for example, the shell itself, sudo, pkexec, etc.). A program which calls exec directly will find itself replaced by the exec'd program, so typical usage is usually fork and exec.\nA contrived example would look like:\n$ cat foo.c \n#include <unistd.h>\nint main()\n{\n    const char * path = \"/bin/echo\";\n    char * args[] = {\"echo\", \"Hello\", \"World!\", NULL};\n    execv(path, args);\n}\n$ gcc -o foo foo.c\n$ ./foo           \nHello World!\n\nYou can see real-life instances of exec usage using strace on various programs, including strace itself:\n$ strace -e execve ./foo\nexecve(\"./foo\", [\"./foo\"], [/* 52 vars */]) = 0\nexecve(\"/bin/echo\", [\"echo\", \"Hello\", \"World!\"], [/* 52 vars */]) = 0\nHello World!\n+++ exited with 0 +++\n\nNote how strace itself uses exec to call the program, and then the program in turn calls exec.\n\n1 ... except for the exec shell builtin, which is a shell feature.\nexec the shell builtin is like the exec functions in that invoking exec with a program name causes the shell to be replaced by it. However, common usage of exec is usually for modifying or adding file descriptors.\nAnother contrived example:\n$ exec 3</dev/urandom\n$ read -u 3 -n 10\n$ echo \"$REPLY\" | base64 \noZN5Qsn3nAs+1GFUCg==\n\nYou might think that we could read in from /dev/urandom directly. Yes, we could. However, this is useful when:\n\n\n*\n\n*we need to read from/write to multiple file descriptors\n\n*we need to replace one or more of the standard file descriptors (for example, send stdout to a file for the whole shell session).\n\n\nA: While doing man exec you have encountered the exec() family of functions which are basically wrapper over the execve(2) system call. \nThe exec you have executed is a shell built-in :\n$ type -a exec \nexec is a shell builtin\n\nNow from help exec :\nReplace the shell with the given command.\n\nExecute COMMAND, replacing this shell with the specified program.\nARGUMENTS become the arguments to COMMAND.  If COMMAND is not specified,\nany redirections take effect in the current shell.\n\nNormally a new process is created by a combination of fork(2)-exec() \n system calls. Here fork() will create a child process with a new PID by duplicating the parent process and then exec() replaces the child process with the desired executable we want to run. For example, when we want to run an executable say top, the shell calls fork(2), thus creating a child process which is exactly the same as the shell with a new PID and then this newly created process is replaced by /usr/bin/top using exec() call.\nNow in the shell builtin exec, the fork() is not called, instead exec() is called directly so the shell is replaced by the executable directly and the new process will inherit the PID of the shell.\nNote that only exec without any argument or redirection will not do anything.\n\nA: in addition to what muru said, exec is a bash builtin command. The following description is copied from bash man page (you can use 'man bash' to view it):\n\n       exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [arguments]]\n              If  command  is specified, it replaces the shell.  No new process is created.  The arguments become\n              the arguments to command.  If the -l option is supplied, the shell places a dash at  the  beginning\n              of  the  zeroth argument passed to command.  This is what login(1) does.  The -c option causes com-\n              mand to be executed with an empty environment.  If -a is supplied, the shell  passes  name  as  the\n              zeroth  argument  to  the  executed command.  If command cannot be executed for some reason, a non-\n              interactive shell exits, unless the shell option execfail is enabled,  in  which  case  it  returns\n              failure.   An  interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed.  If command is not\n              specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell, and the return status is 0.  If there\n              is a redirection error, the return status is 1.\n\n", "Q: How to view youtube videos in 1080p in Firefox? Since Firefox 40 it plays in HTML5 but can't choose 1080p...

Everything worked fine with secure boot on. But now it suddenly stopped working and Ubuntu can't boot with secure boot turned on (through shimx64) and just redirects me to windows when I choose that option. I can however turn off secure boot and boot from my grubx64 boot option.

I noticed that /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi was not listed under \"Boot files\" for sda1. I am not sure what caused it to stop working but it may have been because of an update. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: My hunch is that you're running into problems with the signature on your copy of Shim. This is a problem I've encountered before with some EFIs; they're sometimes finicky and don't like signed binaries that are just fine on other computers. Specifically, I've seen this problem with an ASUS P8H77-I motherboard -- but other brands and models may be subject to the same problem, as well.\nIf I'm right, you have basically two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Secure Boot.\n\n*Find another (possibly older) Shim program and use it.\n\n\nThe first option is pretty self-explanatory and you've obviously discovered it already. For the second, there are probably at least a dozen Shim binaries floating around with Microsoft signatures. One that's never given me troubles, but that's old, is Matthew Garrett's signed Shim 0.2. To use it, you should overwrite the shimx64.efi and MokManager.efi binaries in /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu with the ones from the archive you find. When you reboot, you'll probably be greeted by an ugly text-mode file selector (MokManager) that makes an Apple II's user interface look sophisticated. Use it to select a Canonical certificate file. This file is available in some Ubuntu package or other, but I don't recall which one. For convenience, I've collected several together for my own rEFInd program; see here for the individual files. You need the canonical-uefi-ca.der file, and it should be stored on the ESP (under /boot/efi in Ubuntu) so that MokManager can read it. Once you enter the Canonical signature file and exit from MokManager, the system might hang, reboot, boot into Windows, or boot into GRUB. The next time you boot, though, everything should work normally.\nUsing an older Ubuntu Shim package is likely to be a little easier, since you won't have to use MokManager. You'll need to track down an appropriate package, install it, and possibly copy the grubx64.efi and MokManager.efi files, as just described. Be sure to keep copies of those files somewhere safe, though; if my hypothesis is correct, the package manager is likely to try to upgrade Shim and replace your files with the broken version.\nIt's unlikely that the case difference you've observed is important. The ESP (mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu) uses FAT, which is a case-retentive but case-insensitive filesystem. In other words, ubuntu and Ubuntu are identical to FAT. OTOH, maybe your firmware has a case-sensitivity bug that interacts with the Secure Boot setting. That seems a bit far-fetched, but stranger things have happened.\n", "Q: Combine multiple images with X and Z coords I'm working on terrain for a game, and the output I chose in the terrain generation software is 256 1024x1024 tiles that I need to combine into one big .png.\nI've tried running some image stitching applications through WINE with no success.

In the \"Live\" boot, I use dmraid to construct a softraid from the two 750GB hard drives on my machine, and then select that when I install Ubuntu.  It goes well until it attempts to install the Grub bootloader.\nI've tried a few tutorials on installing the bootloader in this kind of arrangement--e.g., manually creating the partitions, doing chroot to the install and then calling \"grub-install\", etc.  This never seems to work.  I get one error or another, and it never really sets the install to bootable.  I even tried setting up a fakeraid (my BIOS provides it), but the installer doesn't seem to like it very much.\nI'm guessing that this approach isn't even feasible without some serious hacking.  The softraid would not even be active at boot time, so I'm guessing a small, non-raid drive (e.g., SSD) would have to be used to contain the install and then it would build the two larger drives into the softraid after startup.\nMy question(s) is, then:  Is this even possible, and if so, can somebody point me to a definitive tutorial on setting it up?  I'm not looking to dual-boot (this will be a Linux-dedicated machine), but I would like to have the (only) two drives in the machine in a RAID0 for the entire install.\n\nA: Your best option is to install a dedicated RAID controller (Newegg.com) and use it instead.

I don't think it will ever be corrected.  If you utilize utilities to create a USB installer, you should be fine.  However, if you want advanced mode options such as creating a UEFI only boot media, you will have to do some extra work.  Here is the easiest solution I have found.  Make your UEFI boot stick, whichever method you prefer.(example is for fat file structure mounted to sbd1 - alter if you are using something else)   Copy the .ISO file you downloaded to that same stick.  Boot away.  When you get to the CD error, do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt-F2\n\n*Enter to start new terminal session \n\n*mkdir /media/usb\n\n*mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/usb\n\n*mount -o loop path/to/iso/file/UBUNTUSERVER.ISO /cdrom\n\n*Press Alt-F1\n\n*Say \"No\" to search again.  Then click \"Detect and mount CD-ROM\"\n\n\nA: Just to note - I managed to go over this problem like this: \nOnce I get the \"Your installation CD-ROM couldn't be mounted...\" message and I'm back at the main Ubuntu Server install screen, I simply plugged the USB thumbdrive out, then plugged it in again, and then after pressing the \"detect CD\" option, I got \"The CD-ROM autodetection was successful... The installation will now continue.\" ... and so the installation continued.\n\nA: After downloading the .iso image from Ubuntu's web page you have to make sure that during download the file is not corrupted by checking the .iso file in terminal with md5sum and sha256sum. To me:\n\n\n*\n\n*download the .iso file again \n\n*check its originality withs md5sum and sha256sum (in terminal locate the downloaded file \"cd download_directory\" then hit \"sudo md5sum FILE NAME.iso and \"sudo sha256sum FILE NAME.iso\" compare the both with given ones in the Ubuntu's web page) if it correct\n\n*then hit \"dash\" search for \"startup Disk Creator\" \n\n*there hit the \"other\" locate the .iso file then\n\n*there format the \"flash-drive\" \n\n*there at least give an extra 1 GB more free space\n\n*Hit\"Make Startup Disk\" when finishes Restart the PC\n\n*When restarting hit \"the F12 button\" to select the boot option.\n\n*From there select \"Removable Flash Drive etc\"\n\n*There it should work.

When I attempt to mark libsdl1.2-dev for installation in Synaptic, fails with the error: \"Depends: libpulse-dev but it is not going to be installed.\"\nBy trying to install libpulse-dev manually I have determined that the problem is that the version of libpulse offered is a more recent version than the version of libpulse-dev offered; apparently someone pushed a newer version of the pulseaudio binaries into the repository without bothering to push the new versions of the header files as well. As a result of this, Synaptic detects the version mismatch between the two packages and refuses to install libpulse-dev. \nI have done some research and considered these options:\n1: Downgrading my version of libpulse in order to match the version of libpulse-dev.\n2: Using apt-get to download libpulse-dev ignoring its dependencies.\nHowever, neither of these options seem like a good solution to me. Synaptic does not handle downgrades anywhere near as gracefully as it handles upgrades; it wants to uninstall dozens of programs when I mark libpulse for downgrade. I'm also concerned that downgrading libpulse could put me in dependency hell, with other programs also needing to be downgraded to be compatible with the older version of libpulse, although I'm too scared to find out if this is actually the case. The second option also seems dangerous, as presumably some structs and function prototypes may have changed in the new version of pulseaudio. I'd rather not use out-of-date header files unless I know for a fact that there were no interface changes which could lead to subtle, headache-inducing bugs down the road.\nSo, does anyone know of a safer way to work around this issue?

Instead let your alias invoke a script containing for instance:\n#!/bin/sh\nfind . -iname \"$1\" -exec vi {} \\;\n\nNote that this will invoke vi once for each file found. If there are many such files, you'll be doing many :q!'s or ZZ's to get out of them. If you want to invoke one instance of vi to edit all files found, change the \\; to a +:\nfind . -iname \"$1\" -exec vi {} +\n\nAlternatively, you could use command substitution to provide the arguments to vi:\nvi $(find . -iname \"$1\")   # do not use when file names may contain whitespace\n\nHowever the downside to this is that it will fail on file names containing whitespace.\nIf you prefer not to create a script file for the command, instead put the statement in a shell function:\nfvi () { find . -iname \"$1\" -exec vi {} + ; }\n\n\nA: ... or use a dirty hack to use alias as if it took parameters ...\nAs several answers have pointed out, aliases do not support parameters the way shell scripts and functions do. Invoking an alias amounts to expanding the alias to its value, then executing the resulting command line with all arguments still in place. \nNo parameter substitution takes place. If you want parameter substitution, define a function instead of an alias. It's just as many keystrokes:\nfvi () { find . -iname \"$1\" -exec vi {} + ; }\n\nHowever, if you insist, here is a hack to refer to command line arguments inside an alias expansion: grab them from the shell history. In your case, this will do the job:\nalias fvi='find . -iname \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e \"s/^.*\\sfvi\\s*//\")\" -exec vi {} + #'\n\nThe output of the subshell executing history | tail -n1 | sed -e \"s/.*\\sfvi\\s*//\" is whatever follows fvi. This gets spliced into the find . -iname HERE -exec vi {} + command, which is what you need.\nExcept ... there is that queer hash sign at the end of the alias definition. I leave it to the reader to figure out its raison d'être, for the smile that unveiling a full-on hack brings. ;-)\n\nA: If you really need an alias, than you could use this answer.\n\nAn alias in the bash doesn't accept parameters. Therefore you need a function and an alias and a slightly changed find command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit your .bashrc\nnano ~/.bashrc\n\nand add the lines below at the end of the file\nmyfvi() {\n    find . -type f -iname \"$1\" -exec vi -o {} +\n}\nalias fvi=myfvi\n\n\n*Reload the configuration or logout and re-login\nsource ~./bashrc\n\n\n*Start with\nfvi '*statis*'\n\nBut you could also use the function directly\nmyfvi '*statis*'\n\n\nExample\nI have three files in my folder\n$ ls -laog\ntotal 4288\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 4329472 Sep  7 11:43 .\ndrwx------ 67   20480 Sep  7 11:28 ..\n-rw-rw-r--  1       0 Sep  7 11:43 bar\n-rw-rw-r--  1       4 Sep  7 11:23 foo\n-rw-rw-r--  1       4 Sep  7 11:23 foobar\n\nAnd when I use the alias\nfvi 'foo*'\n\nvi opens with two files.\n\n", "Q: Recent update blew out audio I have a Dell XPS 13 (2015) with the recent BIOS update installed before installing Ubuntu.

I use Ubuntu 16.10 with XFCE4 but that does not matter at all.\nWhy DVD-RAM? Because it is more reliable and more stable archiving data. See Wikipedia for details on DVD-RAM.\nHowever, DVD-RAM is rather an external drive than a DVD to write on. Not all drives can write and read. However, most modern Laptop and Computer optical drives can.\nCareful: DVD-RAM is slow by modern means. Don't force the mount and umount to break.\nWe have to format it as UDF file system. This is the appropriate FS for the DVD-RAM (I do not quote the details here, use duckduckgo.com)\nKnow your CD-Writer: Mount a CD, with „mount“ watch out for the name. Like /dev/sr0.\nTake the DVD-RAM out of the cartridge if necessary, put it in your drive and reboot.\nPrepare:\nsudo apt-get install udftools\nsudo apt-get install dvd+rw-tools\nMake a mount point:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/dvdram0\nand adapt the user rights etc. You need to adapt the rights again for the mounted DVD-RAM (different than vfat floppy or external drive).\nAdapt the fstab:\nsudo vim /etc/fstab\nFor automatic mount enter a new line like\n/dev/sr0 /mnt/dvdram0 auto user,users,rw,auto,exec,utf8 0 0\n\nThe first auto may better be \"udf\". The second auto depends on you: Try noauto if the boot process hangs.\nFormat the DVD-RAM:\nsudo mkudffs --media-type=dvdram   /dev/sr0\nThe default options for mkudffs probably match your needs. Otherwise: man mkudffs !\nMount the DVD-RAM:\nmount /dev/sr0\nshould do it, otherwise use as sudo mount /dev/sr0. With the fstab entry it will be found.\nWhen you ask your CLI now with mount it should answer something like:\n/dev/sr0 on /mnt/dvdram0 type udf (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,utf8,user=myname)\n\nNow again adapt the access rights for the mounted(!) drive:\nsudo chown myname /mnt/dvdram0\nsudo chmod u+rwx /mnt/dvdram0 \nTest your access rights:\nmkdir /mnt/dvdram0/mydirectory\nwithout sudo it should work.

I restarted the system and  it automatically booted Ubuntu without showing any option for windows. Here is my output before and after running the boot-repair program:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/12306439/\nP.S. I am a complete newbie in Linux and this is my first attempt at any OS except Windows so I am completely at loss here,\n\nA: From the file you uploaded at paste.ubuntu.com, I see that you must see GRUB that allow you to select between Ubuntu and windows.\nIf you can see grub2 during booting, you can select windows from there.\nIf you don't see GRUB , try pressing Esc key repeatedly just after you turn on your device. This may help you enter the GRUB.\nAlso try this \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into ubuntu. Open terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+t.\n\n*enter sudo update-grub. press Enter key.\n\n*reboot.\n\n\nA: Several points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your disk uses GPT, and there's evidence of an EFI-mode Windows boot loader. On a GPT disk Windows must boot in EFI mode. This in turn means that, if GRUB controls the boot process, it must be an EFI-mode version of GRUB; the BIOS-mode GRUB will be useless to you.\n\n*You've got both BIOS-mode and EFI-mode GRUB installations. This makes it hard to tell which GRUB is in control of the boot process. Given the preceding point, if the BIOS-mode GRUB ends up being run, it's Game Over in terms of booting Windows, at least for that particular boot. The best way to ensure that this won't happen is to disable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), aka legacy-mode boot support, in your firmware setup utility. (Many Ubuntu installation guides provide the bad advice to enable this feature. Doing so creates confusion and problems like yours.)\n\n*Your EFI System Partition (ESP) is near the end of the disk rather than near the beginning, where it's more commonly found. Your configuration is legal, but the fact that it's unusual could explain the next point....\n\n*Your grub.cfg file shows no evidence of a Windows entry, which is consistent with what you're reporting. Creating a fresh GRUB configuration file might fix this problem. Typing sudo update-grub in Ubuntu will create a new configuration file; however, whatever problem caused Windows to not be detected before might persist and prevent it from being detected again. Thus, this procedure might be ineffective. Running Boot Repair is a more radical possible solution; this re-installs all of GRUB. Again, it's not guaranteed to do any better, and there's a small chance that it will actually make matters worse.\n\n*Another approach is to bypass GRUB. There's evidence that you tried my rEFInd, but you don't say whether it worked or why you abandoned it. In any event, rEFInd is usually better at detecting and launching Windows than is GRUB, so it's worth trying (again). You can try rEFInd on a CD-R or USB flash drive as a test if you don't want to (re-)install it on your hard disk, then install it to your disk only if you're satisfied that rEFInd is working.\n\n\nSo in sum, I recommend you try your choice of rEFInd, update-grub, or Boot Repair, in increasing order of riskiness. (rEFInd is least risky if you try it from a USB flash drive or CD-R, and slightly more risky if you install it to your hard disk.) I also strongly recommend you disable your CSM, no matter what other solution you attempt.\n", "Q: What is the command to delete a directory that has files in it? I did man rmdir.

I use ubuntu mate 15.04.\nThank you for your help.\n\nA: It isn't using Java or Flash. It's Three.js which uses WebGL.\nIt might be possible your browsers aren't seeing a 3D graphics device powerful enough, or it might be that you don't have the drivers set up correctly, or it could just be that you don't have your browser set correctly.\nI'd start with the last by viewing the official WebGL support page. If that doesn't work it will direct you to your browser's settings. If that doesn't work, it's time to look at your graphics setup in Ubuntu.\n\nIt seems your Intel 945 integrated graphics might be so underpowered that it's been blacklisted to stop things grinding to a halt. It might also just not support enough features.\nHowever you can force Firefox to ignore the blacklist by opening about:config in Firefox (put that in the address bar) and setting the following keys to true:\nwebgl.force-enabled\nlayers.acceleration.force-enabled\n\nThis may make Firefox crash however.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run a Windows .msi installer? Is it possible to install a Windows program from an MSI installer so that the installed program can be run with the Wine program loader?\n\nA: Open the terminal, change directories with cd to the location of the .msi file, and install the .msi file with a command of the form wine msiexec /i whatever-filename.msi.\nAccording to the official WineHQ FAQ:\n\nMSI files cannot be run directly, you need to use the msiexec program. msiexec is a tool for installing .msi packages. MSI files can be installed in Wine from the terminal like this:\nwine msiexec /i whatever-filename.msi \n\nAlternatively:\nwine start whatever-filename.msi\n\nThat will then run the MSI program the same as if you had double-clicked it in Windows.\n\nThe first command can be changed if necessary to suit the circumstances. For example:\nWINEPREFIX=/path/to/wineprefix wine msiexec /i /path/to/filename.msi  \n\nor using wine64 instead of wine:\nWINEPREFIX=/path/to/wineprefix wine64 msiexec /i /path/to/filename.msi \n\nA WINE prefix is a folder that contains all of the WINE configurations as well as all of the Windows pieces that WINE uses for compatibility, including libraries and a registry.\nIf you want to uninstall the same .msi file later on run wine msiexec /x whatever-filename.msi\n", "Q: Disable hyperlinks in gnome-terminal Is it possible to disable hyperlinks in gnome-terminal? The terminal should never underline any text, and clicks should always start selecting.\nThere are two reasons why I want to do this: First, I simply click into a terminal window when it's at the back without looking what's in the terminal, and often accidentally click a hyperlink that's there. Second, when using npm, there will be lots of text that look like e-mail addresses, but which aren't, e.g. react@0.13.3. \n\nA: Actually, It works as you need in Ubuntu 14.04 (gnome-terminal 3.6) and in Ubuntu 15.04 (gnome-terminal 3.14)\nLinks activated only with:\n\n\n*\n\n*a Left Click while holding Ctrl\n\n*or using Right Click → Open Link.\n\n\nDouble Click makes selection.\n\nA: Unfortunately gnome-terminal offers no configuration option to disable these. You might want to recompile it, removing the entries from url_regex_patterns in src/terminal-screen.c.\nThis hyperlink feature doesn't influence the normal text selection by mouse, you can still click and select the text. Clicking on a hyperlink to bring the window forward shouldn't have any undesired side effect. (The feature influences the rarely used rectangular selection (Ctrl+Click becomes \"open link\" instead), and populates the right-click menu with extra entries.)\nOf course, I understand that underlining the text and changing the mouse pointer shape on hover is visually unpleasant when you have many false matches, but I don't see how it causes an actual behavioral problem.\n\nUpdate: \ngnome-terminal version 3.18.3 reimplements the matcher regular expressions from scratch, in a way that leads to much fewer false positives than in preceding versions. E.g. \"react@0.13.3\" is no longer treated as a valid e-mail address.\n", "Q: USB ports not working all of a sudden I work with Ubuntu Studio 14.04 since an year, and I never had issues related to USB ports.\nNow, since a week or so, all of my USB ports (two 2.0 and one 3.0) stopped working.

Therefore you could also use\nsudo a2enmod php5-cgi\n\nAfter that don't forget to restart the apache2 service\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nas commented by @ThomasW.\n\nfor nginx you should be using php5-fpm, NOT php5-cgi\n\n", "Q: function keys for volume not working properly in ubuntu 14.04 LTS When using the volume buttons (+, -, mute) they are reacting weirdly. When I press the key for increasing the volume a bit, it'll go to the maximum automatically and when I decrease the volume, it'll automatically go to 0.\nVolume control with the mouse works fine.\nThe buttons are working and get recognized:\nChecked with keyboard system settings tool: they get recognized by the tool both from the laptop directly as well as from my USB keyboard.\nWho can help?\n\nA: It is similar to bug \nOpen terminal and run the commands:\n gsettings reset org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys volume-up\n gsettings reset org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys volume-down\n gsettings reset org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys volume-mute\n\nhope it work .\n\nA: Even if not determining the cause of the problem, or fixing it, I will provide a workaround.\nGo to Settings -> Keyboard Shortucuts -> Sound and Media -> Volume down and assign a shortuct.\nLikewise for Volume up.\nThat will at least get you going.\nI tried it with F2/F3 and it worked great. Of course, I am taking a keyboard shortcut that should be free and available, but that is probably a minor issue.\nRelated:\n\n*\n\n*https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/solved-keyboard-hotkey-for-sound-volume/16911\n\nA: So long as the system is registering the keypress, you should be able to bypass this with xmodmap. Increasing and decreasing the volume is usually done in increments of 6% (unless you've changed this, which wasn't easily done on 18.04), so bypassing the default keypress — even with the same keys — may resolve the issue.\nFirst things first: determine the keycodes for volume up and volume down.\n\n\n*Open Terminal (if it's not already open)\n\n\n*Use the showkey command to determine if the media keys are being detected and what the keycodes are:\nsudo showkey\n\nOnce showkey is running, press the media keys. You may see something like this in the output:\nkeycode 114 press\nkeycode 114 release\nkeycode 115 press\nkeycode 115 release\n\nNote: On my Lenovo Thinkpad, 114 is Fn+F2, and 115 is Fn+F3. You will probably see something different if you have dedicated keys for volume.\nIf you do not see any output, it means that the OS does not recognise the key presses at all and there's little you can do about it aside from searching for (or writing) a custom driver that will add support for your keyboard to Linux. Suffice it to say, if you don't see any input, you can skip the rest of this answer.\n\n\n*Write down the keycodes that you see for your media keys\nNow we get to create a keyboard mapping file for xmodmap. Again, in Terminal:\n\n*\n\n*Create a file that will contain your keyboard mappings in your home directory, such as .xmodmap:\nvi ~/.xmodmap\n\nNote: Feel free to use a different text editor. The use of vi here is more muscle memory than an implicit endorsement.\n\n\n*Add the lines for your volume control:\nkeycode 114 = XF86AudioLowerVolume NoSymbol XF86AudioLowerVolume\nkeycode 115 = XF86AudioRaiseVolume NoSymbol XF86AudioRaiseVolume\n\nNote: Be sure to replace 114 and 115 with the keycode values that were recorded from showkey.\nThere are other XF86 keysyms that you might find useful, such as:\n\n\n\n\nXF86 keysym\nAction\n\n\n\n\nXF86AudioMute\nMute the audio\n\n\nXF86AudioPause\nPause the currently playing audio (or restart)\n\n\nXF86AudioNext\nMove to the next audio track\n\n\nXF86AudioPrev\nMove to the previous track (or rewind the current track to start)\n\n\nXF86AudioStop\nStop the currently playing audio\n\n\n\n\nMy Lenovo does not have dedicated keys for previous and next, so I remapped Fn+F11 and Fn+F12 for the purpose.\n\n\n*Save the file\n\n\n*Tell xmodmap to use the configuration file:\nxmodmap ~/.xmodmap\n\nNote: There is no need to use sudo here.\n\n\n*Try it out\nSo long as the OS can identify the keypresses for your audio keys, this should do exactly what you're looking for.\n", "Q: How can I add image icon (e.g. national flags) to indicator-sysmonitor based on IP location? I recently installed system indicator monitor by fossfreedom (https://github.com/fossfreedom/indicator-sysmonitor) and I am able to add a custom shell command.  \nSince I VPN to many different servers around the world, I would like to have this monitor show a flag icon based on location.  Currently, I configured it to show two letter country code (e.g. US, UK, BR, etc.), but I want it to replace this with the location of a flag icon in my directories.\nI installed a series of flag icons from famfamfam-flag-png, which installs 16x11 flag pngs here: /usr/share/flags/countries/16x11/\nSo using the 'indicator-sysmonitor' I thought I can add a custom script ($HOME/scripts/checklocation) such as:\n    curl ipv4.icanhazip.com | curl ipinfo.io | grep country | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/,//g' | sed 's/\"//g'\nwhich reports the two letter country code, then I can replace it with the path to the appropriate icon. But I am not sure how to do this...  Need help configuring my custom script above to report the appropriate flag icon and then to make it work so it would replace 'LOC: BR' with just the flag for BR in my panel.\n\nA: You're currently using this long chain of commands to get your country code:\n$ curl ipv4.icanhazip.com | curl ipinfo.io | grep country | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/,//g' | sed 's/\"//g'\nUS\n\nYou can simplify that whole thing to a single http://ipinfo.io lookup:\n$ curl ipinfo.io/country\nUS\n\nYou can combined that with the flag image path like this:\n$ country=$(curl -s ipinfo.io/country)\n$ flag=\"/usr/share/flags/countries/16x11/${country}.png\"\n$ echo $flag\n/usr/share/flags/countries/16x11/US.png\n\n", "Q: Run thousands of commands sequentially I have a task now to run some thousand of commands sequentially.

These will not be digested by Windows or Mac.\nThese files could be renamed to \nScreenshot 2015-09-07-25--10--10\n\nI have to move a large amount of files from Ubuntu to another OS. I copied them to an NTFS drive using Rsync, but that lost some files.

(question mark)\n* (asterisk)\n\nAnother issue is that Windows is not case-sensitive when it comes to file names, (and most OS X systems as well).\n\nA: You could do something like:\nrename 's/[<>:\"\\\\|?*]/_/g' /path/to/file\n\nThis will replace all these characters with a _. Note that you need not to replace /, since it's an invalid character for filenames in both filesystems, but is used as the Unix path separator.\nExtend to a directory and all its contents with:\nfind /path/to/directory -depth -exec rename 's/[<>:\"\\\\|?*]/_/g' {} +\n\nNote that both / (which marks the end of the pattern) and \\ are escaped. To retain uniqueness, you could append a random prefix to it:\n$ rename -n 's/[<>:\"\\/\\\\|?*]/_/g && s/^/int(rand(10000))/e' a\\\\b\na\\b renamed as 8714a_b\n\n\nA more complete solution should, at least:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert all characters to the same case\n\n*Use a sane counting system\n\n\nThat's to say, foo.mp3 should not become foo.mp3.1, but foo.1.mp3, since Windows is more reliant on extensions.\nWith that in mind, I wrote the following script.

Since the script only renames the file itself (not the path), there is no risk of messing with directories.\nThe replacement is defined in the list: chars (see further below). It is possible to give each string its own replacement, to be able to reverse the renaming if you'd ever want to do that. (assuming the replacement is a unique string). In case you'd like to replace all problematic strings by an underscore, simply define the list like:\nchars = [\n    (\"<\", \"_\"),\n    (\">\", \"_\"),\n    (\":\", \"_\"),\n    ('\"', \"_\"),\n    (\"/\", \"_\"),\n    (\"\\\\\", \"_\"),\n    (\"|\", \"_\"),\n    (\"?\", \"_\"),\n    (\"*\", \"_\"),\n    ]\n\nDupes\nTo prevent duplicated names, the script first creates the \"new\" name. It then checks if a similarly named file already exists in the same directory. If so, it creates a new name, preceded by dupe_1or dupe_2, until it finds an \"available\" new name for the file:\n\nbecomes:\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\ndirectory = sys.argv[1]\n\n# --- set replacement below in the format (\"<string>\", \"<replacement>\") as below\nchars = [\n    (\"<\", \"_\"),\n    (\">\", \"_\"),\n    (\":\", \"_\"),\n    ('\"', \"_\"),\n    (\"/\", \"_\"),\n    (\"\\\\\", \"_\"),\n    (\"|\", \"_\"),\n    (\"?\", \"_\"),\n    (\"*\", \"_\"),\n    ]\n# ---\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n    for file in files:\n        newfile = file\n        for c in chars:\n            newfile = newfile.replace(c[0], c[1])\n        if newfile != file:\n            tempname = newfile; n = 0\n            while os.path.exists(root+\"/\"+newfile):\n                n = n+1; newfile = \"dupe_\"+str(n)+\"_\"+tempname\n            shutil.move(root+\"/\"+file, root+\"/\"+newfile)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as rename_chars.py.\n\n*Edit if you want the replacement list. As it is, the scrip0t replaces all occurrences of problematic characters by an underscore, but the choice is yours.\n\n*Test- run it on a directory by the command:\npython3 /path/to/rename_chars.py <directory_to_rename>\n\nNote\nNote that in the line:\n(\"\\\\\", \"_bsl_\"),\n\nin python, a backslash needs to be escaped by another backslash.\n\nA: I think the above solutions might work, but you have another case: ext filesystem allows longer filenames and folder names. You also have to consider the length of the names and trunk them using some algorithm, adding numbers or something in the end in the case of duplicate names.\n", "Q: Most basic ubuntu package I want to build a Linux system from scratch, and i want the most basic Ubuntu package.

Already tried:\nservice libvirt-bin reload\nreload libvirt-bin\nand killall -HUP libvirtd without success. Is there a way to reload this configuration file? Or do I need to restart all the guests?\n\nA: Do not do it in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf, but rather do it in the definition file for the guest itself, for example in /etc/libvirt/qemu/serv64_dev.xml. here is an example of the relevant section:\n<graphics type='vnc' port='-1' autoport='yes' listen='0.0.0.0'>\n  <listen type='address' address='0.0.0.0'/>\n</graphics>\n<video>\n  <model type='vmvga' vram='9216' heads='1'/>\n  <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x02' function='0x0'/>\n</video>\n\nUse virsh edit domain name to edit, example virsh edit serv64_dev (from any directory), as it does some additional checks upon exit.\nThe default editor used by virsh edit is as defined by the $EDITOR environment variable, or VI if it does not exist. add export EDITOR=\"/bin/nano\" to your ~/.bashrc file to set, for example, nano as your default editor.\n\nA: You need to allow the port in Ubuntu's firewall as well.\nroot@ubuntu:~# ufw allow 5901\nSkipping adding existing rule\nSkipping adding existing rule (v6)\n\n\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu need a FQDN to get internet and email working?

I\"m not sure if an email client (not the same as an MTA) has the same requirements. \n(At work I got around this with a Perl program which talks directly to the SMTP server, because I only needed to send emails.

This is not true, because you have 30198MB of memory available for your applications. \nThe rest that does not show up as \"free memory\" (3068MB) is used as cache. This is a great technology that makes HDD access much faster by caching data that Ubuntu thinks you might need soon from the disk into the free RAM. This cache is not shown as \"free\", but is available because the kernel can drop cache immediately when RAM is needed for your applications. \nSee http://www.linuxatemyram.com/ for more well visualized and easily  understandable information.\n", "Q: Resize root Partition that is lvm'ed I know this question has been asked many times, but I'm having a hard time figuring this out.

Touch) but I have not been able to.\nThe touchscreen is recognized as a tablet device but I can live with that.\nIf I give some Options such as Option \"Ignore\" \"on\" under the following section in 10-evdev.conf then it works (meaning, it disables the touchscreen). If I do the same under the touchscreen catchall, it does not work! Also, in the xorg log, I can see that it is recognized as a tablet (I believe this is a bug in the kernel but it really doesn't matter as long as I can configure the touchscreen and have it working properly)\nSection \"InputClass\"\n  Identifier \"evdev tablet catchall\n  MatchIsTablet \"on\"\n  MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n  Driver \"evdev\"\nEndSection\n\nNow, my problem is that no matter what Option I've tried, I am not able to disable dragging. If I touch the screen and drag my finger across the screen, it draws a rectangle or actually drags the icons on the desktop. \nAll I need from the touchscreen is click (tap) functionality since I'm going to be using is as a kiosk.\nCan anyone give me the right configuration to disable dragging?\nThanks\nNahom\n\nA: OK, found the solution:\nYou need the Linux eGalax driver from here ....\nhttp://www.eeti.com.tw/drivers_Linux.html\nAfter you unzip this download, look in the Programming Guide in the /Guide directory. It contains lengthy instructions. I did not follow them all, but note that my PC only has a single point touchscreen.

(https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootPartition)\n\nNow when I start my computer, it says \"Windows Boot Manager boot failed\". Will you guys be able to help? I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!\n\nA: Both your Boot Repair output files indicate the presence of backup files created by Boot Repair -- that is, the utility copied the Windows files (such as bootmgfw.efi to another name and replaced the original files with duplicate copies of GRUB. Boot Repair sometimes does this to work around bugs with certain EFIs, which tend to ignore or forget the EFI boot order variables. Recent versions of Boot Repair will only do this if you explicitly tell it to do so in the Advanced menu, but older versions over-applied this ugly hack of a fix (to an equally ugly bug) to all repairs. Thus, it's not clear to me whether you're using an older Boot Repair or you told it to apply this workaround. Either way, the workaround is likely at least part of the problem, since your grub.cfg file provides pointers to the original Microsoft boot loader filenames, not their backups. This might have happened if you used update-grub in Ubuntu to create a new grub.cfg file after applying the Boot Repair workaround. (Boot Repair itself should create a grub.cfg that points to the backed-up file.)\nYour second Boot Repair output lacks the backup files for the main Windows boot loader file (bootmgfw.efi). I assume this is because you modified or copied this file (you wrote that you \"replace[d] the bootmgfw.efi in /boot/Microsoft/Boot,\" but you didn't specify what you replaced it with). Depending on what you did, this might make recovery more difficult.\nYour efibootmgr output (lines 1689-1700 in your second Boot Repair output) indicates that your computer is configured to boot the Windows entry -- but as the Windows boot loader has probably been replaced by GRUB, a boot through GRUB to Ubuntu would not be surprising.\nIn sum, your system is in a tangled mess of a state. For recovery, I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your ESP! The EFI System Partition (ESP) is normally mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu. It's a FAT partition that holds boot loader files, and to enable recovery from future mis-steps that might make matters even worse, backing it up is in order. Fortunately, it's relatively small, and a file-level backup (made with cp or tar, for instance) should suffice. Copy the ESP to a FAT USB flash drive for greatest flexibility -- you may even be able to boot using the flash drive in a pinch.\n\n*If you're using an old copy of Boot Repair, trash it and get the latest version instead.\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a boot medium from the files. The point is to have rEFInd as an emergency system; you should be able to boot Ubuntu and/or Windows from rEFInd, should things go south.\n\n*Launch Boot Repair, enter the Advanced menu, and select the option to restore backed-up files. This may get things working again. OTOH, there's a chance that this will make matters worse -- that's where the backup and rEFInd may become helpful.\n\n*If the preceding doesn't help, boot using the rEFInd boot medium. It should show you options to boot both Linux and Windows -- possibly multiple options for both. Try each of them and see if you can get into either or both OSes. You may be able to use this to recover from a disaster (say by restoring your ESP backup) or to gather further diagnostic information. For instance, if you select a Windows icon and it boots GRUB, then that's a clear indication that the replacement I described earlier has occurred and has not been fixed. Note that a problem at this point could take many forms, so I can't provide explicit instructions without writing a small book. You'll have to wing it or post back with details for more help.\n\n*If you can't get into Windows at this point (via either a fixed GRUB or rEFInd), then you'll need to restore your Windows boot loader using Windows tools. This is a topic best covered in a Windows forum. Be sure to specify that you're booting in EFI mode; there's a lot of inapplicable BIOS-mode advice still floating around, and people who know only BIOS mode offering inapplicable advice. Chances are that recovering the Windows boot loader will cause the computer to boot straight to Windows. You can use the rEFInd external medium to boot back into Ubuntu and then use efibootmgr to restore the Ubuntu boot loader to the default, or use Boot Repair to re-install GRUB, or install rEFInd to your hard disk by installing its PPA or Debian package, as you see fit.\n\n*Once you get everything working, make a fresh backup of your ESP, so that you can restore it to a working state if and when new problems arise.\n\n\nA: In my case the \"Locked-ESP detected\" error seemed to be caused by my partitions being mounted. (I was running Boot-Repair from a Ubuntu Live USB, as explained in the 2nd option of the Boot-Repair wiki).\nOnce I unmounted the partitions (I used gParted, right-clicking on every partition and choosing unmount), Boot-Repair succeeded in repairing my system (using Recommended Repair).\nSee also this article.\n", "Q: How can I dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 10 but have my PC boot into windows without prompting me at start up I want to be able to put Ubuntu on a spare Hard Drive of mine while still primarily booting from Windows 10 on my SSD however I would like to be able to boot straight into Windows by default without going through grub. But I would still like the option if i turned on the pc to say hold down a key and then it give me a boot menu, is this in any possible?\nThanks \n\nA: It is quite easy to do. You can install Ubuntu to HDD and install grub there.\nThen set SSD as the first boot device in bios.\nThen you will be able to use your bios boot menu to boot to Ubuntu. \n", "Q: 14.04.3 Login screen loop Graphic card failure I'm running 14.04.3 on a ASUS Netbook X201E.

This is usually done by hitting Esc or a function key as the computer begins to start, but details vary greatly from one model to another.\n\n*The EFI boot manager probably has entries for Windows, Ubuntu, rEFInd, and probably some others. Select the rEFInd or Ubuntu entry.\n\n*Once Ubuntu boots, open a Terminal.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr in the Terminal. You'll see a series of Boot#### entries, a BootOrder line, and a few more things. Note the BootOrder line; it specifies the order in which the computer will attempt to launch the various Boot#### entries. Chances are Windows will be at the top. Note the numbers associated with other boot entries -- particularly rEFInd, if you want to restore it as the default. Note that the Boot#### numbers are hexadecimal, so you might have something like Boot000B as an option.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr -o a,b,..., where a,b,... is a list of numbers for a new boot order. For instance, sudo efibootmgr -o 5,2,3 would set Boot0005 as the default, Boot0002 to be tried if that fails, followed by Boot0003. Recently, efibootmgr has been insisting of four-digit numbers on some computers, so you might need to use something like sudo efibootmgr -o 0005,0002,0003.\n\n*Reboot to test the results.\n\n\nWith any luck, the system will reboot into rEFInd (or GRUB, if you set it as the first entry).\nThere are other ways to do this. For instance, you can boot an Ubuntu emergency disk rather than boot your normal Ubuntu installation. You'd probably still need to go through the EFI's own boot manager, though, so this won't really gain you anything unless your Ubuntu installation is damaged -- and in that case, you've got a bigger problem on your hands!\n", "Q: my app was rejected for ubuntu touch store due to 'unconfined' I got a message from the review process\n\nThe moderators noted the issue to be addressed as follows:\nsecurity_template_valid (compass.apparmor):\n(MANUAL REVIEW) 'unconfined' not allowed\n\nI have been accessing the /sys/devices/platform/msensor/driver/sensordata to read the values from the magnetic sensor (qt libraries do not work so I had to take direct approach in reading sensor status). However apparmor does not allow reading from file even by setting\n\n\"read_path\": [\n          \"/sys/devices/platform/msensor/driver/\"\n      ],\n\nIs there any easy way to overcome that problem, to get a simple compass application to a store I have programmed, the code is open ...\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: First, the error message that you quote suggests that the problem is not with the specific read path, but that you're using the 'unconfined' profile.  Instead, you should be using the standard confined profile with the additional read path, so that the permissions are as limited as possible.\nOnce you do that, you may get a rejection that says,\n\nfound redflagged fields (needs human review): read_path\n\nAt this point, you can request a manual review.  I think there will be a link or a button on the \"Feedback\" page of your app's myapp.developer.ubuntu.com site, but it might be hiding somewhere else.  There is, unfortunately, no timetable for the manual review process.  You may want to go into #ubuntu-touch and bug someone to take a look at it.\nEventually someone will decide whether or not to allow this.  I don't know what criteria are used to judge these reviews.  My guess is that if your app is pure QML it will be accepted, since they can examine your code to check that it doesn't do anything nefarious.  I'm less sure of what will happen with compiled code.\nIf the official app store doesn't accept your app, you may wish to submit it to the Open App Store, which exists to hold useful apps that can't live under the restrictions of the official store.\n", "Q: Is it possible to MOUNT and entire external disk and not by partitions? I want to mount an entire drive in read-only mode.\n\nA: No, that's not possible. Only file systems can be mounted and there is one per partition.\nIf you want to mount several partitions at once, that's possible, but they need different mounting points. Please write a comment if that's what you want.\nIf you want to delete all but one partition and make this one partition as big as the entire external HDD, that's also possible. Again, write a comment and I will help you.\n", "Q: software suggestion for drawing software diagrams i am new to Ubuntu.\nneed a suggestion for software to making **ERD,class & level diagrams in Final year project\n\nA: Dia is a popular one. It doesn't really have a way to export/import to SQL though, in case you want that from your ERD diagram editor. It should be able to draw whatever kind of diagram you want fairly easily though.\nIf you need Database interaction try mysql-workbench. It claims to let you mess with the schema of an actual connected database as an ERD, though I haven't used this feature myself.\nBoth are in the Ubuntu software repos.\n", "Q: Buttons on a Logitech G300 aren't recognized properly NOTE: I have checked other solutions, but they differ in the principle that they offer customization of mouse buttons and add different functions to them, whereas I only want the buttons to be recognized properly. \nE.g. I want left click to be mouse1 (but that works), right click to be mouse 2, middle mouse3, G4 to be mouse4, G5 to be mouse5 and so on.\nAtm. G5 is recognized as mouse8, G4 as mouse9 and G7 and G6 are both recognized as Control_L, so I can't even use them.\n\nA: You can use  Logitech-Gaming-Software.

I have noticed that unlike in other browsers, in Firefox there is no proper History view as such, because the only way to get a history in the right order is to set it on Most Recent Viewed (if you go Menu > History > Show All History) but that still means that if at 17:45 I go to askubuntu.com, then if I go there again at 18:55 I will never be able to see at what time previously I went there.\nAnd I will only be able to see the last time I went to that page, now for some (although I don't know how) this might be more efficient in some way or just better, but for me it really is not, so is there a way of viewing the full history properly where I can see all the times that I have gone to the same page and not just the most recent? Or is this a feature which I will have to request in Firefox (Google Chrome has this feature)?\nJust to clarify: I want to make it so that each visit to each individual page gets a new individual entry in the history view instead of it overriding the previous entry about me visiting that page.\n\nOS Information:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\nCodename:   vivid\nFlavour: GNOME\nGNOME Version: 3.16\n\nPackage Information:\nfirefox:\n  Installed: 40.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.15.04.1\n  Candidate: 40.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.15.04.1\n  Version table:\n *** 40.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.15.04.1 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid-security/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     37.0+build2-0ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid/main amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: According to this mozillazine page the history for the browser is stored in places.sqlite file in the profiles folder (.mozilla/firefox/ on Ubuntu.)\nSo, I pulled that file up and took a look at the tables within the database. Within the moz_places table there is a column last_visit_date which provides you with an Unix time/Epoch time number.\nHowever, there are no other columns that provide a number for initial visit and thus no way to provide a true browser history other than the one that Firefox themselves provide.\nTL;DR: As far as I can tell by looking at the Firefox SQLite files, there is no way to get a full history other than the one the browser provides.\nEDIT: I have created a basic Firefox addon that will write the date & time (in Unix/Epoch format) along with the page title and page URL to the firefoxHistory file in your home directory.\nThe code is available on this github gist.\n\nA: As I wrote already here for Firefox and Google Chrome, here the part for Firefox:\nThe history can be found in a database table in places.sqlite in SQLite format 3:\n$ file ~/.mozilla/firefox/rsbxl7fx.default/places.sqlite\n~/.mozilla/firefox/rsbxl7fx.default/places.sqlite: SQLite 3.x database, user version 26\n\n\n\n*\n\n*rsbxl7fx.default\nDepending on your profile\nTo view the history you need to install sqlite3:\nsudo apt-get install sqlite3\n\nStart sqlite3 with\nsqlite3 ~/.mozilla/firefox/rsbxl7fx.default/places.sqlite\n\nand list eg. all tables:\nsqlite> .tables\nmoz_anno_attributes  moz_favicons         moz_items_annos    \nmoz_annos            moz_historyvisits    moz_keywords       \nmoz_bookmarks        moz_hosts            moz_places         \nmoz_bookmarks_roots  moz_inputhistory\n\nOr the history with:\nsqlite> SELECT datetime(a.visit_date/1000000,'unixepoch') AS visit_date, b.url FROM moz_historyvisits AS a JOIN moz_places AS b ON a.place_id=b.id WHERE 1 ORDER BY a.visit_date ASC;\n\n\nAlternatively, a GUI may be used:\n\n\n*\n\n*sqlitebrowser\nsudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser\n\nand start with:\nsqlitebrowser ~/.mozilla/firefox/rsbxl7fx.default/places.sqlite\n\n\n*sqliteman\nsudo apt-get install sqliteman\n\nand start with:\nsqliteman ~/.mozilla/firefox/rsbxl7fx.default/places.sqlite\n\n", "Q: What is the group nvidia-persistenced Since I use the PPA ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa I have the group nvidia-persistenced in my system. Why this group is needed?\n% cat /etc/group | grep nvidia\nnvidia-persistenced:x:154:\n\n\nA: \nThe nvidia-persistenced utility is used to enable persistent software state in the NVIDIA driver. When persistence mode is enabled, the daemon prevents the driver from releasing device state when the device is not in use. This can improve the startup time of new clients in this scenario.\nThe daemon does not require root privileges to run, and may safely be run as an unprivileged user, given that its runtime directory, /var/run/nvidia-persistenced, is created for and owned by that user prior to starting the daemon. nvidia-persistenced also requires read and write access to the NVIDIA character device files. If the permissions of the device files have been altered through any of the NVreg_DeviceFileUID, NVreg_DeviceFile_GID, or NVreg_DeviceFileMode NVIDIA kernel module options, nvidia-persistenced will need to run as a suitable user.\n\nSo this group is created to handle specific permissions for this daemon. E. g. /var/run/nvidia-persistenced is owned by nvidia-persistenced.\nSource\nAnd this user and group is not specific to the PPA. It is created for Nvidia drivers installed from Ubuntu repositories as well.\n", "Q: Cheese not detecting webcam I'm trying to record video with a webcam I bought (Logitech C170), looks like Cheese doesn't detect it).

I even tried re installing. I tried the commands sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade, it runs and shows \nE: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nAlso it shows \"use this source\" instead of install button.\n\nA: You're using an outdated version on Ubuntu.  Install Ubuntu 14.04 instead, and everything will work.  Ubuntu 12.10 is not a LTS version, so questions about it really are solved by upgrading to 14.04 (the current LTS - Long Term Support - version).\nThe problem is that the repos have been removed from the apt-get master list server side, so what apt-get is looking for doesn't exist anymore.  Really, your best bet is to upgrade to 14.04, or 15.04 if you want a more recent (and less buggy for some GPUs) version.\n", "Q: SWAP increasing during network traffic I have a huge HDD with /home mounted and a small SSD with / and swap (6GB for the latter, 5.7GB shown in Ubuntu 15.04).\nFrom another computer, I initiated writing into my HDD. I intend to transfer about 250GB via my 100Mb/s ethernet connection. The files are large enough which leads to the fact that the network is used almost optimally (usually around 100%, seldom 99%).\nAfter a while I noticed that the swap partition (on my computer - the destination of the transfer) is becoming more full (about 20% right now). When I pause the transfer, the percentage stagnates.\nI assume that my HDD can't handle the load of incoming data and the swap is used in order to maintain the transfer speed.\nI expect that when I pause the transfer, the swap percentage will decrease slowly. But it doesn't.\nSo I kindly ask for some answers to my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What happens when the swap partition is full? Will the transfer speed be automatically decreased in order to make HDD comfortable? Will the computer reboot? Or freeze?\n\n*If the transfer finishes before the swap is full, will it empty itself and store the data to the HDD? If not, what should I do?\n\n*Can I command the network card (or some deamon maybe?) to accept the packets more slowly? If so, how?\n\n*Can I force the system to move data from swap to HDD when the transfer is paused? If so, how?\n\n\nA: My guess is that since the data you are transferring are written in memory through DMA from your network card, and then stored to disk again using DMA (i.e. memory regions that cannot get swapped), the kernel just swaps pages from other applications, which is normal and, imho, shouldn't alarm you.\n\n\n*\n\n*When system cannot allocate any memory theoretically it terminates processes to free memory (I don't know the algorithm that it uses to choose which ones). Practically system freezes and/or panics in my experience.\n\n*When transfer is complete, swap data will be read back to memory when needed.\n\n*You can turn off the swap and then turn it on again using swapon and swapoff commands.\n", "Q: 14.04 crash - blank desktop icons, toolbar icons and menu icons, no desktop button on login I work with Linux professionally, but the desktop is not something I know much about; thus the call for help from those more knowledgeable than myself.\nThis is a new install (8 months ago) of 14.04 on a Dell M6800 notebook.\nThe system crashed and dumped core showing a core listing on the screen.

There are some files missing from it. In order to get a module that works for the A6100, CONFIG_RTL8821AU needs to be enabled during compile and then there is a build failure due to missing header files. See https://github.com/diederikdehaas/rtl8812AU/issues/99\nI stumbled onto a similar Github repository that appears more complete: https://github.com/Rajpratik71/Realtek-rtl8811AU_8812AU_8821AU_linux-source-code.git  The 8812au driver produced by this repository works with a6100. \nAlso working is the rtl8812au driver from https://github.com/abperiasamy/rtl8812AU_8821AU_linux\nAll of these drivers appear to be based on MS Window device driver code from Realtek, but there is no attribution and I didn't see where the source code came from.\nThe 8812au above driver has about 20% dropped packets; the rtl8812au driver drops something like 300%. \nWith the 4.4.0 kernel source there is a driver for the 8821ae, which is PCI, not USB. Maybe this one can be adapted.\n", "Q: If I install Xubuntu desktop Are there any conflicts with installing different Desktop environments in Ubuntu ?\nI have already installed Gnome-Shell and can't log-out the session to switch DE.\nI have to reboot to change.\n\nA: I'm not sure what exactly your problem with GNOME might be, but to answer your general question: You can have different DEs in Ubuntu (and Linux in general) without any problems.\nOnly when using PPAs, you sometimes can run into trouble with library dependcies and stuff.\n", "Q: SDK QML slider on release signal I am using the slider component from the 15.04 Ubuntu SDK components, see here for the docs. Currently, there is no signal for releasing the slider handle, but there is one for when it is touched (when there is a click on the slider). I was wondering if there is a way to implement this, perhaps using the boolean variable pressed, which tells us: Whether the Slider is currently being pressed?\n\nA: QML properties come with signals that fire when that property changes.  A property foo has the corresponding signal onFooChanged.  This suggests two ways you could notice when the slider is released:\n1) Connect to the onPressedChanged signal.  This will be fired both on press and on release, so you'll need to check that the value of pressed is false before running the code that you want to run on release.\n2) Connect to the onValueChanged signal.  Assuming you have live set to false, this will fire only when the slider is released at a new value.  Depending on your needs, this may or may not be desired.\n", "Q: Unable to reboot and/or shutdown? wait-for-state stop/waiting\n*Using makefile-style concurrent boot in runlevel 6\nCan't open /etc/init.d/.depend.stop: No such file or directory\n\nI recieve this message upon a reboot and/or shutdown attempt.

NVIDIA graphics have problems on Ubuntu, so it's good you use AMD graphics. I actually have a similar rig (same RAM, graphics and CPU) and Ubuntu runs just fine.

The desired number to look up is given as first command-line argument.\nIt would make much easier if there wasn't the header line - that would eliminate enumerate() call, and simplify line check to if i.strip().split(\",\")[1] == sys.argv[1]\n", "Q: Ubuntu hangs before boot So, basically I encountered the error when the power went off.

Shortly after I posted this question, I added a swap partition, and things have been pretty smooth\n", "Q: wifi is not coming up in network connections in xubuntu 15.04 I have no problem with wired connection, but wifi is not even an option on my newly installed xubuntu 15.04.

You always need to use sudo before that command. So if a user is not a member of group sudo that user won't be able to run any command as root even with using sudo.\nIn your case, as you were running :\nmkdir -p $HOME/.ansible/tmp/testfolder\n\nyou will get permission denied message as the directory /home/ubuntu/.ansible is owned by root and there is no permission for others to write on it.\nOn the other hand while you were using :\nsudo mkdir -p $HOME/.ansible/tmp/testfolder\n\nyou were impersonating root who has the permission to write on that directory so the command was a success.\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu on same partition as Windows 7.

Later, I found out about the awesomeness that is Linux and decided to have it on this computer as the main OS for development and such. I installed it alongside Windows 7, without issue, and the world seemed perfect then. A good time after that, the 1 TB drive arrived and I gave all that to another Windows 7 as a separate partition from the other, older Windows 7. It seems Windows likes rather large files, even in its updates.\nSince it isn't all great fun to have about 200 GB to Linux and >1.25 TB for Windows, I wanted to give my Linux install a \"bonus\" for being so awesome. I just wanted to do it after the latest release of Linux Mint. During the process of installing the new version as a clean installation (and, of course, backing up prior), I had chosen the option of essentially formatting the entire 500 GB drive to a blank state and installing the new version of Linux Mint there with the aforementioned setup. The 1 TB drive was never touched, at least I don't remember so.\nAfter the installation was over and the computer was rebooted, there was no way of accessing the Windows drive. To elaborate, I would get a \"BootMGR is missing\" error when trying to directly access Windows from the BIOS boot menu, and Windows 7 was unlisted in the GRUB menu. I did manage to \"fix\" the Windows \"BOOTMGR is missing\" issue (via Windows 7 install DVD), however Windows will still not load, and instead the computer reboots and directs me back to the GRUB menu, in which the Windows entry is missing anyway.\nI can access files on my Windows partition through my file manager, as well as mount the drive, without issue.\nI have tried tools such as boot-repair, and the Windows installation disk (the latter possibly making the situation worse?), with both not being especially helpful in results.\nThis concludes my \"essay\", if you will, and I hope I was thorough enough in my problem's explanation.\nIf there is any material I should post (such as the contents of \"grub.cfg\") please let me know.\nThank you in advance for your most appreciated help!\nEDIT:\nHere are the contents of \"grub.cfg\":\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/00_header ###\nif [ -s $prefix/grubenv ];

Choose 'System repair', select the Windows on the second hard drive and open a command prompt. Issue \nbootrec /fixmbr\nbootrec /fixboot\n\nThis will write a new Master boot record and bootloader to the disk. You should now be able to boot from the Windows drive by selecting it in the BIOS boot menu.\nAlternatively, or if the above approach does not work you may select 'startup repair' from the repair menu instead of opening a command prompt.\nIf that went well, boot into Mint, and update Grub via\nsudo update-grub\n\nwhich is synonym to\nsudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nThe script should recognize the Windows bootloader on the second hard drive. You should see a corresponding message written to the terminal. If that's the case, all went well and you will be able to load Windows from Grub.\n", "Q: Cannot boot Ubuntu on dual boot with Windows 10 I have a dual boot with Ubuntu and Windows 10.

Our servers will be OK? What will revert our servers?\nThanks!\n\nA: From the Ksplice User's Guide (http://www.ksplice.com/uptrack/guide):\n\nKsplice and Kernel VersionsBack to top Ksplice Uptrack updates your\n  running kernel in memory. We recommended that, in addition to using\n  Ksplice, you continue to use your package manager to update the kernel\n  on disk as new kernels become available. That way, if a reboot becomes\n  necessary (e.g. power loss or a hardware upgrade) you have the option\n  of booting into a newer kernel. Under this plan, you would install all\n  the updates available via both Ksplice Uptrack and your package\n  manager.\nKsplice Uptrack also works great in environments where it is desirable\n  to stay with a particular original kernel version (e.g. because of\n  third party modules that are compiled against that kernel) but you\n  want to stay up to date with all the important security and\n  reliability updates for your kernel.\nBy default, Ksplice Uptrack will reinstall rebootless updates during\n  the boot process so you remain secure even after a reboot. You can\n  configure this behavior by changing the install_on_reboot option in\n  /etc/uptrack/uptrack.conf.\n[...]\ninstall_on_reboot will restore the Linux kernel to the same version\n  as before rebooting. There may be additional updates that could be\n  applied. If you wish all available updates for a particular kernel\n  version to be applied, set upgrade_on_reboot to yes.\n\nSo, nothing bad should occur. If a power loss happens, your system will boot on the default kernel version and Ksplice will by default re patch your system with security updates at boot time so you don't get uncovered. It will make your boot time longer, so, if you need a faster boot, you should install the updates for your packages using your default package manager too.\nAs a note, if you will update the kernel of a server you should like to do a kernel only update, isolated from other system updates, always as possible.\n", "Q: acer aspire v3-112p not booting ubuntu from hardware I just kill windows and was installing ubuntu 14.04 in a acer v3-112p, the process seemed allright, but when I was trying to boot the machine again from the HHD, I have this 'no bootable device' message.

I need to use Tor with Chrome but all the tutorials are for windows, the only one for Ubuntu involve having the vidalia manager but the tor bundles i download dind't come with it.Does anyone know how to do this?\n\nA: It is not impossible to configure chrome to use Tor. You can do this by, for eg:\ngoogle-chrome --proxy-server=\"127.0.0.1:8118;https=127.0.0.1:8118;socks=127.0.0.1:8118;sock4=127.0.0.1:8118;sock5=127.0.0.1:8118,ftp=127.0.0.1:8118\" --incognito check.torproject.org\n\nor by other methods as described here. \nNote that this is highly discouraged, because using any browser besides Tor Browser with Tor is not going to give you the protection you needed. The Tor Project advises against this because their discussions with Chrome team to add missing APIs, mainly - Web Request, Content Scripts, and the Proxy APIs - that would be useful for privacy enhancing extensions, were unsuccessful. There are also several bugs that should be dealt with before even a low-grade privacy-by-design can be provided through Tor in Chrome's Incognito mode.\nSo, in short,as said in the FAQ :\n\nCurrently, it is impossible to use other browsers and get the same\n  level of protections as when using the Tor Browser.\n\n", "Q: Which GPUs offer the best support for linux? I have a HD 7870 graphics card on Ubuntu 15.04. The proprietary drivers have already phased it out for support, so I am debating getting a new graphics card. \nThe questions I am trying to ask is this; what proprietary drivers seem to be the most stable with Ubuntu, steam on linux, and in particular, mine craft? \n\nA: Nvidia graphics cards are cooler and quieter than similar capacity AMD graphics cards across the board, which is worth considering if you are using OptiFine HD mod in Minecraft. According to Steam’s hardware survey as of August 2015 only 27.0 percent of Steam gamers have an AMD video card, compared to 52.2 percent for Nvidia.\n\nA: The best experiences I have made with Nvidia. Of course with the proprietary drivers and currently with this PPA.\n", "Q: Restoring Ubuntu default icons folder Here's the stupid thing I did: I deleted many folders inside the icon folder, with root privileges, and now some icons are gone, but not the main ones, the ones from compiz for instance, or some from top notification bar, like the skype one. I looked for days to find a solution to restore the icons folder, or to find the default Ubuntu icons to put them back to the folder, but I have found none.\nI use Ubuntu Tweak Tool to switch between themes, icons, or cursors, and it works perfectly, but no theme or icon pack seems to bring back some of the icons like I mentioned before. \nI hope there is a way to reinstall ubuntu default icon packs. Thanks in advance ;)\n\nA: Unfortunately, applications  like compiz usually install their own icons. You can install these icons by re-installing the application to replace the missing files.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nThat should work if the files are missing, however, if it doesn't, you can download the application and manually replace the files like so:\ncd\nmkdir aptget;cd aptget\napt-get download compizconfig-settings-manager\nar xvf *\ntar xvf data*\nsudo cp -rT ./usr/share/ /usr/share/\ncd ..\nrm -R aptget\n\n\nA: I solved it: Downloaded the ubuntu 14.04 iso. Mounted it with VirtualBox, used root to go to the icons folder, archive it, uploaded it to the internet. Then downloaded it to my OS, and just copied it to the 'shared' folder. Basically I restored the icons folder by copying it from the ubuntu iso file. ;)\n\nA: You can download an unzip in the :\n/usr/share/icons\ndownload default icons from here:\nhttp://4uploader.com/dl/257/icons.7z\n", "Q: How to Update Qt 5.4.1 to Qt 5.5?

The iPhone caused the trouble.\nWith Debian 6 i use this line to connect the iphone to the caldav calendar:\n http://192.168.1.1/davical/caldav.php/user/home/\nFor Ubuntu 14.04 i use this:\n http://192.168.1.1/davical/caldav.php/user/calendar/\nFrom Thunderbird it works fine. But the iPhone only see the entrys created with it. But not the normal from Thunderbird.\nHas anybody worked with caldav and iphone to help me?\n\nA: Today I can present a solution for a particularly nice problem:\nHow to connect an iPhone to a Caldav calendar using Ubuntu 14.04. So far I had connected iPhones to a Debian 6 server which actually worked perfectly. However, the outdated Davical version had some disadvantages in combination with Outlook. \nThat’s why I decided to install Davical on the Ubuntu 14.04 Server as well to the effect that it also offers the calendar service. \nThe connection of Thunderbird/Lightning worked perfectly as well and also Outlook synchronizes the data with the server by means of the Evo commands. Only the iPhone has proved to be problematic. \nSo far I proceeded in such a way that I installed the calendars in Lightning then imported the data and finally entered the URL of the calendar in the iPhone.  \nUp to now the composition of the URL has been like this: \nhttp://192.168.1.1/davical/caldav.php/user/calendar/\n(for Debian’s older version of Davical 0.9 it must be home instead of calendar)\nAlong this path the iPhone does not find the calendar.\nThe solution is to first of all configure the calendar on the iPhone. Here you select the address again as above. When you have saved the calendar, you log in to the web interface of Davical and navigate to the user\n(user functions -> user display) and select the user there. Under “collections of principal” you will find a link in the following format: \n/davical/caldav.php/user/D553F027-30BE-1F30-BAB2-5F8AC31F74D2/\nYou have to insert this link in Thunderbird/Lightning as a URL to the calendar. In our example this would be:\nhttp://192.168.100.1/davical/caldav.php/user/D553F027-30BE-1F30-BAB2-5F8AC31F74D2/\n", "Q: keyboard \"acts weird\" while playing Diablo 3 Wine I've just recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my computer, and I'm quite the noob still. \nI have managed to get Diablo 3 working through Wine though, but I'm encountering one final problem. \nQuite often, my keyboard would seem to stop responding. The caps lock/num lock keys still toggle on and off, but none of the others seem to have any effect. \nI've found a way to get the keyboard to respond again by pressing ESC two or three times. This is an annoying problem though, and I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for it. Can anyone help me find it? \n\nA: If you're using Ubuntu with the Unity desktop, what might happen when you play is that you press the Alt key. That's the key which by default brings up the Unity HUD. Because of the way Wine and X11 interact, you don't see it but it's there and now it's \"stealing\" input. That is why pressing Esc cures the problem.\nYou can rebind that. Install CompizConfig settings manager, click on the Unity Plugin and in the \"General\" tab, redefine \"Key to show HUD when tapped\". I bound it to Ctrl+Alt.\nYou could also bind the functionality of the Alt key in-game to some other key so you don't have to tap it when you want to see what loot there is on the floor.\nIf you accidentally tap the Windows key, something similar might happen. This is the key which usually invokes Unity Dash (think Windows start menu). It's strange why Blizzard did not add an option to disable the Win key in D3. They have it in SC2.\n", "Q: Mouse pointer disappears on primary monitor? I just installed ubuntu 14.04.03 LTS with the AMD frglx driver on my Lenovo E550.

You mention upx packer, did you ever read the manual of upx? \nIf you lost the source, or do not have access to code of somebody else doesn't matter here, it is simply not possible. \nThe binary executable was produced with a compiler, don't believe anything stated on this site, just read the manual of exactly that compiler. Then, you could add here, in what language the original code was written, which compiler was used, and then you might note yourself that this steps (preprocessing, compiling, linking, maybe packing) are not reversed as a whole, but could only be analyzed what the original author might have intended, and written.\n\nA: This is probably a binary file (an ELF File) as described nicely here:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format\nIf you have altered it with a normal text editor and saved your changes, this was no good idea and you may have destroyed it.\n\nA: As Oli pointed out already in his answer, you can't get the very original source code of an executable.\nDuring the compilation of a source code (compilation intended as in its typical wider acceptation, hence as the whole process that \"transforms\" a source code into an executable), lots of informations are lost.\nThe C preprocessor, for one, will do the following (among other things):\n\n\n*\n\n*Interpret, execute and remove preprocessor directives (# statements)\n\n*Remove comments\n\n*Remove unnecessary whitespace\n\n\nOn the other hand what isn't lost during the compilation of the source code is technically revertible to a functionally equivalent source code.\nThis is because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Binary instructions have a 1:1 corrispondency with assembly instructions; the assembling of an assembly source code is just a mere conversion of the assembly instructions to the binary instructions based on a table of corrispondencies; a single binary instruction is always identifiable and revertible to a single assembly instruction;\n\n*Assembly instructions don't have a 1:1 corrispondency with C instructions; the compilation of a C source code is usually not just a mere conversion of the C instructions to the assembly instructions based on a table of corrispondencies, in fact it's often the opposite; usually a C instruction is converted into multiple (often different based on the compiler) assembly instructions; however, patterns of multiple assembly instructions are usually identifiable and revertible to a single C instruction;\n\n\nThere are tools called decompilers whose purpose is to try to revert an executable to a functionally equivalent source code; however the result is usually something far from the very original source code (and usually also uncompilable);\nConsider this program:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define MESSAGE \"Literal strings will be recovered\" // This preprocessor directive won't be recovered\n\n/*\n\nThis comment and the comment above won't be recovered\n\n*/\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    printf(MESSAGE);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBy compiling it into an executable and decompiling it into a source code again, this is more or less what you usually get back (in this specific case I used gcc / Boomerang):\n// address: 0x80483fb\nint main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp) {\n    printf(\"Literal strings will be recovered\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAs predicted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preprocessor directives are missing\n\n*Comments are missing (aside from // address: 0x80483fb, which has been added by the decompiler)\n\n*Unnecessary whitespace is missing (aside from newlines and tabulations, which have been added by the decompiler)\n\n\nThis is also a pretty good result; it's not rare to get inline assembly instructions into the code:\nasm(\"assembly_instruction\");\n__asm__(\"assembly_instruction\");\n\nThe bottom line is (as pointed out already in the other answers): you can't get the very original source of an executable*.\n*However, depending on the executable and on your luck, you might be able to get something using a decompiler.\n\nA: It's binary. The source code has been compiled. You can view it in an editor (a hex editor like bless might make for more refined changes) but you really need to know what you're doing. It's likely only good for making string changes.\nFor anything more hardcore, you can start to reverse engineer the binary into assembly code. This is often regarded as the lowest level human-parsable computer language.\nobjdump -d helloworld | less\n\nBut it'll include a lot of compiler nonsense too. For example, if you compile the most simple helloworld.cpp with G++ and then objdump it, you end up with 226 lines (208 stripped) of yuck. You could write a \"hello world\" in just 15 lines of assembly, compile it and objdump it but that still blossoms into 166 lines (stripped).\nIf you're good enough with assembly, this may give you enough access to understand what's happening, and even let you change it... But to answer your original question:\nYou cannot turn compiled code back into the original source code.\nSorry. It's a one-way transformation that loses information (comments, formatting, readable algorithm concepts, etc), is statically linked to other things and is generally optimised in such a way that would make it unintelligible to anything but the best and most seasoned programmers.\nTo give you an idea of the scale of the problem, the whole idea of reverse engineering software has its own Stack Exchange site.\n\nA: Executables are usually binary if you are talking about compiled programs. You can find more information by using file path/to/executable. You can display binary executables in hexadecimal by using e.g. hexdump -C path/to/executable | less (whatever good that would do you). If you want to \"convert it back to its original form\" you'd have to use an appropriate decompiler see this post, e.g., though that would give you quite unreadable code not the original it was compiled from. \nIf it's not a compiled binary it would be some kind of executable script, which should be easily readable in any text editor. What you showed us here is probably a a compiled executable. ELF means \"Executable and Linking format\" which is a common binary format on Linux/Unix systems. There's a possibility to extract the readable string parts from binary files by using strings path/to/executable, if this is what you need. \n", "Q: How to run bin file on 14.04?

If I re-add it, everything works fine again.\nIt makes sense, because desktop switcher is one of the few panel plugins that needs feedback from the desktop, in order to show window miniatures and its placement.

If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.\nSwap should equal 2x physical RAM for up to 2 GB of physical RAM, and then an additional 1x physical RAM for any amount above 2 GB, but never less than 32 MB. \nRecommended swap space: 4 GB\n(That's formula which usually used but in practice you do not need to allocated a Swap Space when you have RAM more than 5 GB unless you run a busy server).\nFor SSD:minimum is 8 GB.

I am running Kubuntu from External Hard Drive. My Internal Hard Drive has Windows on it. I don't want to use it while on Ubuntu and want to turn it off to produce less heat as well consume lower battery. I think spinning down hard drive isn't an option for me. Because, it wear out the hard drive and I don't plan to spend on HDD's :)\n\nA: sudo hdparm -Y /dev/sdX\n\nwhere /dev/sdX is the device you'd like to turn off.  You can also run sudo blkid to determine the device's 'fingerprint' (UUID), which would allow you to more reliably control which device is being turned off.\nIn this case, you'd run:\nsudo hdparm -Y /dev/disk/by-uuid/DEVICE-IDENT-HERE\n\n\nman hdparm\n   -Y     Force  an  IDE  drive  to  immediately  enter  the  lowest power\n          consumption sleep mode, causing it to shut down  completely.   A\n          hard  or soft reset is required before the drive can be accessed\n          again (the Linux IDE driver will automatically handle issuing  a\n          reset  if/when  needed).   The  current power mode status can be\n          checked using the -C option.\n\n\nA: You likely have the udisks2 package installed; you can use \nudisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdX\n\nwhere /dev/sdX is the device you'd like to turn off.\nFrom udisksctl man page (version 2.7.6):\npower-off\n    Arranges for the drive to be safely removed and powered off. On the OS\n    side this includes ensuring that no process is using the drive, then\n    requesting that in-flight buffers and caches are committed to stable\n    storage. The exact steps for powering off the drive depends on the\n    drive itself and the interconnect used. For drives connected through\n    USB, the effect is that the USB device will be deconfigured followed\n    by disabling the upstream hub port it is connected to.\n\n    Note that as some physical devices contain multiple drives (for\n    example 4-in-1 flash card reader USB devices) powering off one drive\n    may affect other drives.

I use only Ubuntu 14.04 lts on my computer, no other OS. Today I downloaded a package called 'Tor browser bundle' (tor-browser-linux64-5.0.2_en-US.tar.xz) from Tor-website to an empty folder called 'Current folder' and extracted it with Ubuntu's Archive Manager without using terminal. Now, even after extracting thrice I can't find extracted folder anywhere except enlisted in Archive Manager's window which also shows its location as '/', so I searched in '/' or Computer folder but couldn't find it there too. Later on I learnt that for security reasons that package shouldn't be unpacked or run as root. As I'm not a technical guy, I don't even know if I extracted it as root. \nFor your info: It didn't ask for any password while extracting. I have only one password I use for logging onto computer & while installing some Ubuntu software updates. One of the folders in Computer folder called 'root' doesn't open (I'm not complaining) saying \"you do not have permissions necessary\". So, where do I find the extractions and whether I extracted them as root? Thanks for your precious time.\n\nA: A few points to make based on your post:\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't look like you've run anything as root. It would have asked for a password.\n\n*Running things as root isn't automatically evil...\n\n*...Just as things can be insecure (and ruin your day) when not run as root.\n\n\nYou've just not been able to find where this has extracted to. You haven't really run anything new. You are probably no less secure than before you did whatever it is you did.\nI'd suggest following the given instructions to the letter instead of deviating and using Archive Manager... Well obviously not to the exact letter because you have to replace LANG with en-US... But you know what I mean.\nIf whatever you were doing extracted anything, it would have created a directory called tor-browser_en-US. You can find this:\nfind / -type d -name 'tor-browser_en-US' 2>/dev/null\n\n", "Q: AnonymoX /etc/hosts override I have some sites blocked via /etc/hosts-entries. My problem is, that after activating AnonymoX, Firefox can still reach these sites. I tried to block the sites for the fake-ips in the hosts file, but without success.\nFor example:\n127.0.0.1 www.website.com\n186.79.175.220 www.website.com\n\nFirst entry successfully blocks website when AnonymoX is disabled.\nSecond entry fails when browsing with fake-ip.\n\nA: AnonymoX is an add-on for Firefox that allows you to browse websites through their own network of proxy servers. \nThat means, your computer connects to an AnonymoX server and sends it the HTTP request. The AnonymoX server then connects to the requested website's real host server, passes your anonymized request on to it with its own AnonymoX IP address as source. The real web server processes the request and sends the answer (e.g. HTML website) back to the AnonymoX proxy, which redirects it back to your own machine.\nSo to your computer, it looks like the AnonymoX proxy is the web server responding to your requests, while to the real web servers, the AnonymoX proxy looks like the one who visits their sites.\nThat means that the web servers can't identify you as visitor, but also implies that you yourself don't have direct contact with their servers and therefore can't block them by their IPs, because you don't connect to those IPs any more but to the AnonymoX ones. You also can't block them by their URL by manually resolving them to your localhost or a fake IP with /etc/hosts-entries or other system-wide DNS manipulations, because AnonymoX handles all the DNS resolving, as otherwise you would connect to the web servers directly. Your browser sends all requests uniformly to AnonymoX.\nWhat you can do is to filter sites before the request gets passed to AnonymoX, e.g. by another add-on that filters outgoing requests and blocks URLs in your browser. Or you could add another proxy server after AnonymoX which is able to filter sites, so that your computer communicates with the AnonymoX proxy, that communicates with the second, filtering proxy, which finally communicates with the real web servers.\n", "Q: Why Ubuntu is not Installing 'Synaptic Package Manager' as default when installing it on the hard drive? I always ask my self about this, and I would really like to know why.\nI mean Synaptic is on EVERY Ubuntu user's launcher and I know it, that is because it is important.\nWhy do I and every Ubuntu user have to install it after installing Ubuntu manually ?\nCan't Ubuntu does it for us automatically ?\n\nA: It's not a default package. That's the technical reason.\nThe rationale behind that is all down to the Ubuntu project leadership. They think the Software Centre more than good enough a replacement (it does do things Synaptic can't) and thought continuing to have two was confusing.\nFWIW, I haven't had Synaptic for years, and I'm still alive.\nMost people use what they're given; the Software Centre in this case. And when that stops working, tools like apt-get and dpkg prove themselves more powerful than any GUI, even Synaptic.\n\nA: Synaptic became obsolete as a graphical tool for \"apt\" when it got replaced by Ubuntu Software Center. \n\nI mean Synaptic is on EVERY Ubuntu user's launcher \n\nYou probably overestimate the usage of Synaptic. On none of my and none of the computers I maintain Synaptic is installed and I know not a lot of people that use it. So \"every\" is not correct and I probably would claim less than 5% of all computers using Ubuntu have it installed. \n", "Q: find vs. locate There are the commands find and locate to search for files on the disk.\nI know that find recursively processes all needed subdirectories to search files and therefore is slow but up-to-date, whereas locate uses a database that gets updated every now and then (when exactly?) to quickly show results which might be outdated though.\nAre there any other differences? In which situations would one prefer the one or the other? And when does the locate database get updated usually?\n\nA: locate is really only good for finding files and displaying them to humans. You can do a few things with it, but I wouldn't trust it enough to parse and —as you say— it's impossible to guarantee the state of the internal database, more so because it's only scheduled to run from /etc/cron.daily/mlocate, once a day!\nfind is live. It filters, excludes, executes. It's suitable for parsing. It can output relative paths. It can output full paths. It can do things based on attributes, not just names.\nlocate certainly has a place in my toolbox but it's usually right at the bottom as a last-ditch effort to find something. It's easier than find too.\n\nA: As much as I like Oli (which is a lot!) I disagree with him on the find command. I don't like it.\nfind command takes over three minutes\nTake for example this simple command:\n$ time find / -type f -name \"mail-transport-agent.target\"\nfind: ‘/lost+found’: Permission denied\nfind: ‘/etc/ssmtp’: Permission denied\nfind: ‘/etc/ssl/private’: Permission denied\n    (... SNIP ...)\nfind: ‘/run/user/997’: Permission denied\nfind: ‘/run/sudo’: Permission denied\nfind: ‘/run/systemd/inaccessible’: Permission denied\n\nreal    3m40.589s\nuser    0m4.156s\nsys     0m8.874s\n\nIt takes over three minutes for find to search everything starting from /. By default reams of error messages appear and you must search through them to find what you are looking for. Still it is better than grep to search the whole drive for a string which takes 53 hours: `grep`ing all files for a string takes a long time\nI know I can fiddle with the find command's parameters to make it work better but the point here is the amount of time it takes to run.\nlocate command takes less than a second\nNow let's use locate:\n$ time locate mail-transport-agent.target\n/lib/systemd/system/mail-transport-agent.target\n\nreal    0m0.816s\nuser    0m0.792s\nsys     0m0.024s\n\nThe locate command takes less than a second!\nupdatedb only run once a day by default\nIt is true the updatedb command which updates the locate database is only run once a day by default. You can run it manually before searching for files just added by using:\n$ time sudo updatedb\n\nreal    0m3.460s\nuser    0m0.503s\nsys     0m1.167s\n\nAlthough this will take 3 seconds, it's small in comparison to find command's 3+ minutes.\nI've updated my sudo crontab -e to include the line at the bottom:\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n  0 0  1   *   *     /bin/journalctl --vacuum-size=200M\n*/5 *  *   *   *     /usr/bin/updatedb\n\nNow every five minutes updatedb is run and locate commands database is almost always up-to-date.\nBut there are no attributes?\nYou can pipe locate output to other commands. If for example you want the file attributes you can use:\n$ locate mail-transport-agent.target | xargs stat\n  File: '/lib/systemd/system/mail-transport-agent.target'\n  Size: 473         Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file\nDevice: 10305h/66309d   Inode: 667460      Links: 1\nAccess: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nAccess: 2018-03-31 18:11:55.091173104 -0600\nModify: 2017-10-27 04:11:45.000000000 -0600\nChange: 2017-10-28 07:18:24.860065653 -0600\n Birth: -\n\nSummary\nI posted this answer to show the speed and ease of use of locate. I tried to address some of the command short-comings pointed out by others.\nThe find command needs to traverse the entire directory structure to find files. The locate command has it's own database which gives it lightning speed in comparison.\n", "Q: I have problems when mounting my USB drive in a nonstandard location My USB drive gets mounted under /media/username. I tried using umount to mount under /media/usbdisk instead. Well, theoretically it worked, but when I used MultiSystem Multiboot USB Creator it doesn’t recognize my USB drive under /media. I searched this entire site and didn’t find a solution. This issue also happened with the Sardu Multiboot USB Creator. And when I tried YUMI, it also did not recognize the drive.

I could find only partial solutions to this problem.\n\nA: It may be confusing that bootable USB creators don’t recognize the USB drive when the OS is doing it properly. The simple solution is to use Gnome’s own disk utility. Use Startup Disk Creator and format your drive (clicking “erase disk” will do the job for you).

Is there any simple way to install newer version of package from newer version repository?\nI tried this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto\nBut this method seems to be able make mess in system when used wrong and it doesn’t work for me.\nPS: It's this package http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libav-tools&searchon=names\n\nA: Pinning won't preference a newer version; Apt does that by default. Pinning is only for sticking on older versions.\nIf you've added a newer repo that contains a newer version of a package, and apt update; apt dist-upgrade doesn't upgrade it, chances are the repo isn't providing updates for your release of Ubuntu (eg 14.04). Visit the PPA's Launchpad page and check the releases it supports.\nThere isn't a universal solution for this. For some [small] things, you can edit the sources configuration (in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/...) and change trusty to whatever release it is that's supported but that often isn't safe.\nYou may be in the position of needing to build it yourself.\n", "Q: Why cant I install brightness-controller I have been having problems with adjusting the brightness.....it is at max (when I look at it, it is at max in the settings.

I installed Ubuntu 12.04 a while back & haven't had any problems until I got this new printer. \nI went to Canons website & they don't seem to have the driver I need. I found some drivers on other websites & downloaded them but they don't appear on the list of drivers when I try to install the printer. \nI'm new at this stuff, so I'd like to avoid using the terminal if I can. I'm a bit nervous about getting under the hood (although I will if I have to).

Scroll down for the .deb versions.\n(I linked to the 32 bit version, if yours is 64 bit just use the dropdown box menu to change it).\nOnce you have downloaded the cnjifilter....deb.tar.gz file, open your file manager and locate the file. Right-click it and select \"Extract Here\".  When this process finishes, you will have folder with the same name as the file you downloaded except it will end in \"deb\".  Doubleclick that folder to open it.\nInside the folder will be two folders and a file called install.sh.  Right-click the file and select Properties.  Click on the Permissions tab in the window that opens.  If the box labeled Execute is not ticked, tick it.  Then select Close in this window.\nNow open a terminal window by typing Cntrl-Alt-T simultaneously.  Then type\ncd ~/Downloads/cnijfilter-mg2500series-4.00-1-deb/ \n(if the folder name is different, substitute what your folder is called)\nNow type\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nA prompt will appear and ask for your password.  When you type it in, you will not see any feedback, not even the cursor moving.  Press enter after typing your password.  \nNow the install script will start.  I cannot run it on my computer so I do not know exactly what it will ask, but hopefully it will be intuitive.\nLet me know in the comments if you encounter any difficulties with this.\n", "Q: Cannot install iTunes on Ubuntu I cannot install iTunes on my PC (32bit) running Ubuntu 14.04LTS.

Any advice?\nAlso, I have been told that I need a disk burner to make this work, but I do not currently have one, and I'd rather not buy one to make it work.\n\nA: You need to be able to download the ISO image file, and save that file to your computer.  Probably \"right-clicking\" the download link and select \"save link as...\" is the best option for you.\nIf you do not have a CD (or DVD) burner, then you can use a USB flash drive that is large enough to hold the contents of the ISO.

This is \"Download from\" drop down menu.\n\nYou do not have to edit sources.list manually. It will be updated automatically.\nBut all mirrors contain same packages. I do not recommend to use country specific server pools, like .in. It randomly picks a server from the pool. Not all servers always work well.

So anybody have any ideas of how I can mount the HDD?\n\nA: I would not be surprised if the adapter is somehow faulty.  The use of a second USB cord to get power violates the USB specifications and anyone that can't be bothered to follow this very basic USB specification is quite likely to violate some other specification.\nI'd suggest returning the adapter if you can and getting one that powers the drive properly.  That would be with a single USB plug for power and data, or with USB for data and a connection to a wall outlet for power.\n\nA: I HAD the same problem.\n1) Restart your pc + login\n2) Plug in the USB\n3) Type \"lsusb\" in the terminal\n4) WAIT for ASMedia to show up\n5) Look at your file explorer and WAIT\n6) KEEP WAITING for 5 minutes.\nIf the hard disk still doesn't show up, repeat (I had to do it approx. 20x).\n\nA: If you are using a desktop (i am), you can plug the hard drive into your motherboard using a sata cable and reboot (don't forget sata power then :) ). I had a much harder hard drive where this worked to get it show up in the disk list using \"Disks\".

I'm writing a script that will clean my computer before I reinstall or install Ubuntu (I'm just like starting fresh). There is a way but is there a command to clean all options instead of doing each (--clean [insert option from bleachbit --list here] *) one by one?  Or does that option not exist?\n\nA: The command bleachbit --clean *.* is generally not recommended, so it is not implemented in BleachBit. However, power users can get the same effect with the following mini-script:\nbleachbit --list | grep -E \"[a-z0-9_\\-]+\\.[a-z0-9_\\-]+\" | xargs bleachbit --clean\n\nPlease note this command ignores all warnings!\nYou can filter options by adding another grep before xargs. For example, this may save you a few hours:\nbleachbit --list | grep -E \"[a-z0-9_\\-]+\\.[a-z0-9_\\-]+\" | grep -v system.free_disk_space | xargs bleachbit --clean\n\nReference: BleachBit forum: Command line: delete everything\n\nA: Provided that you have a preset in your \n\n$HOME/.config/bleachbit/bleachbit.ini\n\nyou can do:\nbleachbit -c --preset\n\nthe good thing about that is that your preset settings can be exactly what you need.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 not loading after clean installation (hangs at \"GRUB loading.\") I bought a new Laptop. Lenovo Y500 with the Intel Quad and GT650 SLI configuration. (maybe this is important)\nI set the whole thing up to load Legacy BIOS primary. As usual I installed on the HDD Windows. In parallel, I installed Ubuntu on the internal mSATA 16GB SSD. Creating only 2 partitions, root and swap, both in the SSD. Also the bootloader is placed on the SSD, so I manually decide on every boot which drive and for that which OS should be loaded.\nAfter the installation Ubuntu keeps only loading a black screen. When I hold Shift while staring, I get a GRUB loading. and absolutely nothing more. I cannot even switch with Ctrl-Alt-F1/2/3... to any console. Odd thing is that Ubuntu runs fine, when I start it in live-mode directly from the USB-drive.\nI'm kinda clueless how to solve this problem, cause I'm not that \"pro\" with Linux, but like to do little works with it. Just tried to install 15.04, the \"beta\" 15.10 and for variety a Mint distro with Cinnamon. All leading to the same problem.\n\nA: Since nobody seems to have a clue, what's wrong with my book (which should truly not be a reproach) i just tried a few more things myself. Like using another tool to create a bootable USB drive, swap partition size, using another drive etc. Nothing seems to work...\nFinnaly i found an unremarkable comment in a lenovo forum, which tells, that the problem is simply the UEFI system, which is always loaded first, even if you choose to use legacy BIOS only. For that you should use a full compatible UEFI Linux distro like Fedora. So i downloaded the newest image, burned it on my USB drive and got exact the same problem booting it the regular way. Not even the live mode works. But the Fedora image provides, in contrast to the Ubuntu image, another \"EFI boot\" menu entry. Booting this works fine and also after the installation it keeps working. You not even need to install any nVidia drivers or edit the boot options.\nWiFi, Bluetooth, brightness control, SLI ... all this seems to be supported out of the box.\nIt's not the prefect solution, cause i'm Ubuntu fan, but if it's not working ... well, it's not working.\nHope this helps users of the same notebook-model, which can't get started with linux too, becase of the configuration.\n", "Q: Encrypting Ubuntu 15.04..? When I first installed Ubuntu it gave me the option of encrypting the install.  At the time I opted not to do so.\nI am interested in doing so now.  I know there are speed considerations, but I am not concerned with them.  Do I have to do a clean install of Ubuntu to get the full disk encryption or can I do it right from the running OS..?!\n\nA: First you should always back up any important directories/files then install some encryption software by running sudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils cryptsetup. You will have to encrypt your home directory while you’re not logged in. This means that you’ll need another user account with administrator (sudo) privileges – you can create one from Ubuntu’s User Accounts window. Login as the new user and run \nsudo ecryptfs-migrate-home -u user\nDo not reboot until you have logged back in as your normal user. \nAfter you log in, click the Run this action now button to create a recovery passphrase. Keep this passphrase somewhere safe – you’ll need it if you have to manually recover your files in the future.\nWhen you set up an encrypted home directory while installing Ubuntu, your swap partition is also encrypted. After setting up home directory encryption, you’ll also want to set up swap encryption. To do so, run the following command in a terminal:\nsudo ecryptfs-setup-swap\nNote that an encrypted swap won’t work properly with Ubuntu’s hibernate feature – which is disabled by default, anyway.\nEdited ..\nThe biggest problem with Ubiquity's automation is the absence of all control which ultimately means you can not dual boot with it, not even with other Linux distros. You can either reformat the entire drive and install only the encrypted Linux, or you can install alongside Windows or whatever else—unencrypted.\nOther negatives are relatively trivial, some not. Your drive's partition table must be MBR format and while the installer does this for you, GPT is out of the question. You're also stuck with logical volumes (hence, needing MBR) which does increase convenience, but at the expense of complexity and overhead. A consequence of logical volumes and MBR is that if your computer has UEFI, the distro will be installed in legacy BIOS mode so you can't use Secure Boot. This setting also gives you a swap size equal to that of your system RAM (often unnecessary) and you have no choice over what kind of encryption is used.\nThe options for encryption are endless this is a quick way to encrypt the important personal files I dont think a full guide (which it would need) is necessary jere, if the OP wants a guide .. just ask and I will be happy to edit my answer to provide a full detailed guide\n", "Q: Drivers for older GPUs Hello I want a old driver for ATI Radeon 4550. This card can run smoothly Ubuntu? I'm new to Ubuntu and I want a driver for it.\nMy specs are:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: Intel core2 duo e6600 2.4 GHz dual core\n\n*Ram: 4 GB\n\n*GPU: ATI Radeon 4550 older but powerful for me.\n\n\nA: You have to stick with the already installed open source radeon driver.\nAMD Catalyst does only support graphics chips as of Radeon HD 5000.\nBut that is no problem because Ubuntu runs great with radeon driver!\n\nA: The open source drivers provided by the repository should work without a problem. \nIf you are new to Linux it can be a hassle to install the proprietary ATI drivers, as it requires you to do all the work from inside the terminal. I have also had problems where the ATI drivers caused problems with the X Window Server, whereas the open source drivers worked like a charm. I have an R7 290x using the open source drivers on my desktop computer (Debian 8) and it is able to run the Cinnamon desktop environment without an issue. It also worked fine out of the box with Ubuntu 14.04. \nIf you are looking to play games on Linux, I don't see any reason why you should be worried about getting the ATI official drivers. An older card like the 4550 can handle the Unity desktop environment and some basic games. If you do not yet have the open source drivers from the repository, open a terminal window and type the following command:\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install fglrx\n\nThis will scan the repositories for the fglrx package and prompt you to accept the installation. \n", "Q: grub-install: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition I have an installation of Ubuntu 15.04 that has been working fine for some weeks. Today, my box locked up to the point I had to power it off in order to clear the error. When I did so, it stopped booting.\nWhen booting, it comes up and displays a cursor and nothing else.\nI tried following the advice here: http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/11/reinstall-grub-ubuntu-wont-boot/ but when I do so, it gives me this error:\nInstalling for i386-pc  platform.\ngrub-install: warning: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible.\ngrub-install: warning: Embedding is not possible. GRUB can only be installed in this setup by using blocklists. However, blocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged..\ngrub-install: error: will not proceed with blocklists.\n\nAny advice as to what to try next?\n\nA: To solve the problem, I had to mark the first partition as \"bios_grub\" via gparted.\nThis partition can be used for nothing else afterwards! It does not hold the boot image, but only the boot manager.\nBefore:\n$ grub-install /dev/sdb\nInstalling for i386-pc platform.\ngrub-install: warning: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible.\ngrub-install: error: embedding is not possible, but this is required for cross-disk install.\n\nAfter:\n$ grub-install /dev/sdb\nInstalling for i386-pc platform.\nInstallation finished. No error reported.\n\n\nA: Way too late to help you, but this might help someone else who, like me, landed on this page in search for a solution to this problem.\nA small partition has to be created on the disk and marked as a code EF02  \"BIOS boot partition\". Somewhere I read it should be 200MB, I only had room for a 1007.0 KiB one and it worked just the same.\n\nA: I'm also late posting but for others' benefit, I just encountered the same error on a Ubuntu Server 18.04 machine configured for EFI boot from a GPT disk.\nOversimplifying, two boot modes exist (BIOS and EFI) and two disk partition schemes exist (MBR and GPT).  BIOS/MBR are from the \"old\" days, EFI/GPT are current.  GRUB installs in (a) the boot sector of a MBR-formatted disk; (b) for BIOS-mode systems in a small (<1 MiB) unformatted \"BIOS Boot Partiton\" on a GPT-formatted disk; and (c) for EFI-mode systems in a ~512MiB vfat/FAT32-formatted EFI System Partition.\nIt looks as if the OP had a BIOS-mode system with a GPT disk.\nMy case was an EFI-mode system with a GPT disk but I was getting the same error.\nThe problem was that there also are two forms of GRUB, one for BIOS-mode systems (grub-pc)(i386-pc) and another for EFI-mode systems (grub-efi)(x86_64).  The former was installed and the latter, wasn't.  The giveaways were (a) the error was inappropriate because the system was booted in EFI mode to a GPT disk; and (b) grub-install insisted on a device specification (e.g., /dev/sda)(and threw the above error when it got one) but doesn't take one when executed on an EFI-mode system.  The fix was simple once the problem was identified:\n# apt install grub-efi\n# update-grub\n# grub-install\n\nHopefully, this will save someone else some time.\n", "Q: VirtualBox not installing on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I am trying to get VirtualBox working on my 14.04 LTS machine.\nAfter installing I keep getting this error:\nThe provider 'virtualbox' that was requested to back the machine\n'default' is reporting that it isn't usable on this system.

Now (probably after the last kernel header update) the laptop automatically boot win10.  \n\nAttempt:\n\nI believed that the problem was a corrupted ubuntu ESP, so I followed the standard CHROOT procedure from a live usb to reinstall the ubuntu ESP on sda2, running the command  \napt-get install --reinstall grub-efi-amd64\n\nAll worked perfectly, but after the re-installation, during the update-grub phase, the windows boot loader was not found, also running a further update-grub command. I exited the chroot and rebooted.\nAfter the reboot the ubuntu ESP started correctly but, as expected, without the Windows boot loader option. I logged in into my Ubuntu and did another update-grub.\nThis time the Windows Boot Loader was found, Youppie! Problem Solved!\nWell that's not that easy. After another reboot, the GRUB prompt was not shown and win10 was automatically booted. Again.\nNote:\nI repeated the procedure twice, sampe steps, same intermediate results, same final effect.  \n\nThe loop in bullets:  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Autoboot win10  \n\n*Restore from live usb with chroot \n\n*update-grub -> win10 loader not found  \n\n*reboot->grub prompt shown -> boot into ubuntu  \n\n*update-grub -> win10 found -> reboot \n\n*Autoboot win10\n\n\n\nThe efibootmgr output before step 6:\n\nBootCurrent: 0004  \nTimeout: 0 seconds  \nBootOrder: 0004,0003,2003,2001,0002,2002  \nBoot0000* EFI Network 0 for IPv4 (F8-A9-63-4E-C6-FF)  \nBoot0001* EFI Network 0 for IPv6 (F8-A9-63-4E-C6-FF)  \nBoot0002* Lenovo Recovery System  \nBoot0003* Windows Boot Manager  \nBoot0004* ubuntu  \nBoot0005* EFI USB Device (JetFlashTranscend 16GB)  \nBoot2001* EFI USB Device  \nBoot2002* EFI DVD/CDROM  \nBoot2003* EFI Network  \n\n\nuname -a output:  \n\nLinux Elianto 3.16.0-48-generic #64~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Aug 20 23:03:57 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux  \n\nIf you need further data from intermediate steps (commands output) ask in the comments.\nThank you.\n\nA: Two possible solutions occur to me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager. This tool is more reliable about booting Windows than is GRUB, so it may work around whatever is causing GRUB to ignore the Windows entry. Note that this means you'll be bypassing GRUB, at least for Windows boots; instead, you'll see rEFInd's menu. (To boot Ubuntu, rEFInd should be able to either boot Linux kernels directly or use GRUB.)\n\n*Create a manual GRUB boot stanza for Windows, as described in my answer to this question. You'll need to change some details, such as the partition identifier (it should probably be (hd0,gpt2)).\n\n\nAlso and FYI, your /dev/sda2 is the EFI System Partition (ESP). Note that it's the EFI System Partition -- it \"belongs\" to the EFI (the computer's firmware), not to any one OS. OSes are required to store their boot loaders in the ESP, but the ESP doesn't really belong to any one OS; it's normally shared by all the OSes. That said, it's possible to have multiple ESPs on a disk, and some users restrict each OS to using a dedicated ESP. That doesn't seem to be the case for you, although I can't be 100% positive of that without more detailed information, such as the output of sudo parted /dev/sda print or sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda. (Summaries such as you provided are almost always inferior to cut-and-pasted program output.) This isn't really relevant to your problem, but I thought I should clear up this bit of confusion.\n", "Q: 14.04 bluetooth Unable to select SEP in the past I had problem getting the bluetooth to work. although I fixed it with ubuntu 14.04 bluetooth BCM43142 no discovery (tx timeout) i still had issue with lags and skips 14.04 bluetooth lag (latency, delay) and skipping\nnow I cannot even pair to a device. here are some details:\n$ uname -r\n3.19.0-26-generic\n\n$ cat /etc/*release* | grep -i dist\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\"\n\n$ lspci -nnk | grep -i network -A 2\n01:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 802.11b/g/n [14e4:4365] (rev 01)\n    Subsystem: Dell Wireless 1704 802.11n + BT 4.0 [1028:0016]\n    Kernel driver in use: wl\n\n$ lsmod | grep -i 'bluetooth\\|btusb\\|wl'\nbtusb                  40960  0 \nwl                   6369280  0 \ncfg80211              524288  1 wl\nbluetooth             491520  22 bnep,btusb,rfcomm\n\n$ lsusb | grep -i bluetooth\nBus 004 Device 003: ID 0a5c:21d7 Broadcom Corp.

new to Unix. I have installed Ubuntu to program in C and will be using the \"Learn C the Hard Way\" online textbook (http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex0.html). I attempted the section in the textbook meant for setting up your computer and the second command is causing me some problems.\nThe first command in the link above executes without issue but when I try and run the second command:\n$ su -c yum groupinstall development-tools\n\nit prompts me for my password and when I enter it, it says \n\nsu: Authentication Failure\n\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: Look again at the web page. You are trying, wrongly, to run a command for an RPM based Linux like Fedora. Instead, run the command that says:\nFor Debian based systems, like Ubuntu you should just have to install a few things using these commands:\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential\n\n\nA: Ubuntu is Debian based, use the first command and leave the second which is for Redhat based like Fedora.\n\nLinux\nOn most Linux systems you just have to install a few packages. For\n  Debian based systems, like Ubuntu you should just have to install a\n  few things using these commands:\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nThe above is an example of a command line prompt, so to get to where\n  you can run that, find your \"Terminal\" program and run it first. Then\n  you'll get a shell prompt similar to the $ above and can type that\n  command into it. Do not type the $, just the stuff after it.\nHere's how you would install the same setup on an RPM based Linux like\n  Fedora:\n$ su -c \"yum groupinstall development-tools\"\n\n\nOnce you've run that, you should be able to do the first Exercise in this book and it'll work. If not then let me know.\nAnyway, that error message from su because you need to enter the root password. It is not the same as sudo which you use your own user password.\n", "Q: dpkg was interrupted.

I tried running pm-suspend --quirk-s3-mode, but when I resumed from that it displayed the screen I had before pressing enter, only it was completely frozen and no key-combos would break it.

I'm not sure what to make of that clue...\nCURRENT WORKAROUND:\nSince hibernate seems to not cause a problem and I have an appropriate amount of swap memory, I just hibernate as the default action for things like closing the lid. Here are the steps I followed to enable hibernate. I also modified other default power settings to go to hibernate using the dconf Editor under org>gnome>settings-daemon>plugins>power\n\nA: I deal with two simple approaches with this issue. The first, which not always works (as you mentioned) just restarts the mouse module after the suspend action. \n\nsudo rmmod psmouse ; sudo modprobe psmouse\n\nHere is a nice discussion on how to do this \"automatically\":\nhow to execute a command after resume from suspend?\nAn alternative approach is to kill the module before suspend, avoiding to lock of the module after the resume (which apparently is what generates the issue, as WinEunuuchs2Unix underlined). \nTo do that I use a simple command line to suspend the laptop instead of just  closing the lid \"manually\". Of course this is not fancy at all, but works and it is a straigh forward solution. No time to hack involved. \n\nsudo rmmod psmouse ; sudo pm-suspend\n\nAnd then, after resuming the laptop, you should re-enable the module by typing:\n\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nYou can always hack the default pm-suspend script, but I won't recommend it. It is simple and safer to generate these ad-hoc small command sequences. \nLast, an easy, fast way to quickly do the \"killing/suspend\" and the \"re-enable\" of the mouse module is to associate those steps with keyboard shortcuts: How can I change what keys on my keyboard do? (How can I create custom keyboard commands/shortcuts?). \nHope it works, it does for me, although is really uncomfortable to deal with this in such way. I have this issue in both, HP and Asus Laptops. \n\nA: It was recommended that I post my workaround as an answer:\nI found that hibernate (sudo pm-hibernate) did not experience the same problems with touchpad restarting, therefore I just set all relevant power options to hibernate instead of suspend. This requires a little bit of effort since hibernate is disabled by default. Here's what needs to happen\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you have adequate swap space (swap memory > RAM). I have an adequate swap partition on my SSD but you can add swap memory without re-partioning your drive.\n\n*Follow the steps here to enable hibernate\n\n*Set additional power options to evoke hibernate instead of suspend. I did this using the dconf Editor (sudo apt-get install dconf-editor). To change relevant settings, open dconf Editor and navigate to: org > gnome > settings-daemon > plugins > power\n\nA: This bug is reported in launchpad: Elantech touchpad stops working after suspend. After suspend the OP tries # modprobe -r psmouse and # modprobe psmouse and it doesn't work. But what if psmouse was removed before suspend and inserted after suspend? \nIf this works manually then you can automate by creating a new file in the  /lib/systemd/system-sleep/ directory containing:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase $1/$2 in\n  pre/*)\n    echo \"Going to $2...\"\n    # Place your pre suspend commands here, or `exit 0` if no pre suspend action required\n    modprobe -r psmouse\n    ;;\n  post/*)\n    echo \"Waking up from $2...\"\n    # Place your post suspend (resume) commands here, or `exit 0` if no post suspend action required\n    sleep 2\n    modprobe psmouse\n    ;;\nesac\n\nIt is known after a suspend the psmouse module can't be removed. We also know it can be removed and inserted before a suspend. So this technique removes it before suspend. After resume insert it and hopefully the kernel won't reject it.\nThe sleep 2 command is from my own problems where systemd and kernel (via gnome or APM) were both sleeping and waking up. I needed to redirect pulseaudio sound back to the TV due to a bug introduced in Ubuntu 16.04/pulseaudio 8.0. The 2 second delay was necessary for kernel and systemd to finish waking up.

I created a script to restart the driver on wake from suspen d as suggested by nihal111 and it works.\nI'd like to add that to get the touchpad to be recognised at all, I had to disable secure boot, switch to EFI booting (disable legacy boot) and add kernel parameter i8042.nopnp to grub config. Not 100% sure that I needed all three of them, but after doing that it started working. The wake from suspend fix sorted out the final issues, and it is now working great!\n\nA: I have several Asus laptops, I have had to disable the touchpad on all of them.  They cause locking issues, and other problems.\n\nA: Drivers that don't respond well to suspension are pretty common regardless of the OS. I'm glad you found a workaround via hibernation. \nSince suspend doesn't fully power off and hibernation does, that would appear to indicate that the driver doesn't respond well to the \"1/2 life\" of suspension, but is perfectly capable of coming up during a power-on cycle which is what hibernation provides upon waking. \nsource: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/pm-action.8.html\n\nA: The various modprobe solutions didn't work for me. What did work was switching to a text-only tty and then back to graphics, with Ctrl+Alt+F3 and then Ctrl+Alt+F2. Note that switching to a different graphical session with Ctrl+Alt+F1 and then back to my original graphical session with Ctrl+Alt+F2 didn't work.\nNote: the F<number>s for your system might be different. E.g. in the past I remember that the graphical sessoin was F7.\n", "Q: Downloading wine-x64 when opening Software Center Whenever I open Ubuntu Software Center or the \"About my computer\", the program seems to freeze and a small Window pops up saying\n\"Downloading wine-x64-unity3d-installer (7MiB)\"\nIt takes about a minute to download, and then Software Center (or Details) unfreezes and I can resume what I wanted to do. The next time I turn on the program, exact same problem occurs. Why is this happening? Does Ubuntu Software Center run on Windows libraries and isn't native to Linux (what a ridiculous idea)\nI tried purging wine and anything that has to do with wine. The only thing left on my computer is a package called \"wine-staging\". I am unable to remove this package as DPKG tells me that the package has dependencies. \nWhat is causing this issue?\n\nA: I found that the cause of this were remaining wine \"addons\". The solution was to enter:\n\n\"sudo dpkg --purge pipelight-multi gnome-exe-thumbnailer\"\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, that's an annoying side effect from having pipelight enabled. You can disable that plugin or you can wait for it to fully install.\n", "Q: How can I install and run Ubuntu directly from an SD card? I've heard that this is possible and I want to do this. I downloaded Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS.iso(64-bit) file and used win32 Disk Imager to write it onto two SD cards to try and get it to work. The SD cards I used were a 64GB Class 10 SDXC card and a 32GB Micro SDHC card (with adapter). I formatted them as exFAT and FAT32 respectively and have tried to format them both as NTFS to see if that worked. I also tried this on a 8GB USB drive formatted as NTFS and it worked just fine. Right now I'm using a Lenovo Y70 laptop with these specs:\nWindows 10 Home (64-bit),\nIntel Core i7-4710HQ 2.5 GHZ,\n16B GDDR3L,\n1TB + 8BG SSHD,\nNVIDIA Geforce 860m (4GB DDR5),\nCard Reader (Support: SD, SDHC, SDXC, MMC),\nI have turned safe boot off and turned legacy support on in BIOS and it still won't even recognize it as a bootable drive, I'm really not sure what I'm doing wrong.\n\nA: If you have a dual-SD card reader where you can insert both cards at once, it's possible.\nWhat you need to do is:\n\n*\n\n*\"burn\" the .iso file on the \"install SD\"\n\n*boot from the install SD\n\n*install on the second SD (wiping it completely)\n\n*remove the \"Install SD\"\n\n*boot from the second SD.\n\nDone!\nIf you want to optimise the system a bit have a look here for some advanced settings.\n\nA: I have a HP Stream laptop with 64GB eMMC internal drive on which Win10 is installed. Tried to install Ubuntu on the SD card and boot off the SD. This process failed as I noticed that GRUB is not aware of any bootable images on the SD card.\nThe workaround for this problem is as follows;\n\n*\n\n*Create a small, 500MB, ext4 partition in the eMMC drive alongside Win10 and use it to mount /boot\n\n*/ and/or /home can reside on the SD card\n\n*Install GRUB on the ESP on eMMC card\n\nWith above now I can dual boot Ubuntu and Win10.\nThe solution was initially posted by RockDoctor in this thread on a hp forum.\n\nA: This is possible, however you will need to have a device that supports booting from an SD. Like a Raspberry PI. If you have an image you can use dd to write it to the SD card.\n", "Q: Replace LikewiseOpen on Ubuntu 15.04 I have just upgraded from 14.04 to 15.04 and I'm getting some errors during start up;\n[FAILED] Failed to start (null).\nSee \"systemctl status lsassd.service\" for details.\n\nThere are multiple instances of these errors for these items;\n\n\n*\n\n*lwregd.service\n\n*dcerpcd.service\n\n*lsassd.service\n\n*lwiod.service\n\n*netlogond.service\n\n*eventlogd.service\n\n*lwsmd.service\nI've run that command and get the following log messages;\nSep 09 08:25:18 XXXXXX systemd[1]: Starting (null)...\nSep 09 08:25:18 XXXXXX  lsassd[1320]: /etc/init.d/lsassd: 24: .: Can't open /usr/lib/likewise-open/init-lwsm.sh\nSep 09 08:25:27 XXXXXX systemd[1]: lsassd.service: control process exited, code=exited status=2\nSep 09 08:25:27 XXXXXX systemd[1]: Failed to start (null).\nSep 09 08:25:27 XXXXXX systemd[1]: Unit lsassd.service entered failed state.\nSep 09 08:25:27 XXXXXX systemd[1]: lsassd.service failed.\n\nThe other instances of the errors all have a similar error message.

Since swap was in the middle, I removed sda3 too and used the space to expand /home so I had to rebuild the swap partition at the end. Now the setup is this:\n/dev/sda1 (ext4) /\n/dev/sda2 (ext4) /home\n/dev/sda3 swap partition\n\nThe swap partition works perfectly, it's mounted on boot or manually with swapon an unmounted with swapoff. By the way, I have removed it from /etc/fstab since the laptop has 4GB of RAM and I never use the swap while the system is running. I wrote a little script that mounts the partition before hibernating and unmounts it when the system is recovered from hibernation.The problem is now when I hibernate and boot the system, the boot process doesn't look for data on it. My guess after some tests is that the system doesn't \"trust\" this new partition and doesn't check for data on it. I guess the UUID has changed?\nThe weird thing is, if I manually mount the partition with \"sudo swapon /dev/sda3\" and then I hibernate the system, the data get saved. I know this because when I'm back on the desktop and remount the partition manually, the swapon utility complains that \"there's data on this filesystem, cleaning up\" (not this exact message, I don't have the laptop right now with me).\nIs there a way to force the redetection of this partition as the default hibernation file to look on boot? \nEDIT: I just realized that I made a mistake when I rearanged the file system: I gave it only 2 GB instead of 4... So, the partition is not big enough for the 4 RAM in the system. Shouldn't it be still able to hibernate if the memory in use was only 500 MB, which is the case? Or would I need to resize it? If so, can I resize the sda3 partition to make it 2GB smaller? The enlarging process was quite straight forward but I'm not sure if shrink a partition is more dangerous, because involves moving some physical data.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yep, it must be greater or equal RAM size (let it strictly greater).\n\n*Partition shrinking needs to move some data blocks. It's up to you to backup or to take the risk. However, 2GB is considered a short time operation, if it is taken from the end of partition (ie sda2). If it was from the beginning of a large partition (example: sda4), my advice forget it.\n\n*To fix the hibernation\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the new UUID\nsudo blkid\n\n\n*Update the resume configuration file with the correct UUID\ngksu gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume\n\n\n*Update RAMDisk\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\n\n*Reboot\nReference: Community Wiki: Swap FAQ\n\nA: Not really sure about that, but i saw that swap partition is mapped on /etc/fstab\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n....

Is it correct?\nPlease explain what happened exactly here in a step-by-step way.\n\nA: \nI expect that echo is blocked here. Is it correct?\n\nA command substitution is always processed before the \"final\" (in this case \"outer\") command is run.\nSo echo is not \"blocked\", but is waiting for the command inside the command substitution to finish its execution, which never happens because the command itself spawns an ssh interactive shell.\nYou can verify this in multiple ways, for example by hitting Ctrl+D, by typing exit and hitting Enter or by opening another terminal instance and running:\npkill -15 -x ssh\n\nAs you can see, terminating the ssh instance by any mean will let the command substitution finish its execution, finally letting the echo command run on its output, which in this case is nothing. \n", "Q: installing Ubuntu 64 bit 15.04 on Origin EON 17SLX(machine has windos 8.1 preinstalled) I am trying to install ubuntu 64 bit 15.04 on a Origin EON 17SLX\nI have disabled fast boot and the secure boot option is disabled in the firmware.\nTo boot to windows, the EFI boot must be enabled, otherwise the machine does not see its windows boot up section.\nI have tried creating a ubuntu boot usb by using  unetbootin-windows-613, when the machine tried to access the usb, a lot of text is printed scrolling like mad, eventually the machine lock up showing some form of collapsed image.\nI am not sure what the issue is, according to all of the on line help that I have read disabling fast boot and secure boot and booting from an EFI boot usb stick should work.

Set this directory up with a \"group\". And you give access to this directory to all users by adding them to this \"group\" so they can put documents in there they want to share. That way you can keep their home their home. It also plans for the future: new users added to the system need to be added to this \"group\" and they have the same directory on the system to put files in there to share.\nBut if you really want 1 user to be able to access another users home add that user to the group of the other user. You can add an existing user to an existing group with:\nusermod -a -G {group} {user} \n\nwhere {group} will be the name of the user you want {user} to access.

Flickering stops when I change Compositor Rendering Back-end To OpenGL 3 and then change again to OpenGL 2.\n\n\n*\n\n*OS: KUbuntu 15.04\n\n*Graphics: Intel HD 4000 \n\n\nA: I was having the same issue but with a different graphics card and a different OS (Fedora 22 KDE spin). I just came across this:\nhttps://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/69542/fedora-22-full-screen-tearingflickering-under-kde/\nwhich has several options that seem to solve the problem under Fedora at least. I'm trying option 3 and it seems to be working so far, and the first two options are things that can be changed purely through the kde system settings app (shouldn't be specific to OS).\nHope this helps you!\nEDIT:\nIn an effort to make this answer better, I'm putting a summary of the link given above here. To solve there issue there are three options\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into System Setting > Hardware > Display and Monitor > Compositor and change the tearing prevention to \"Full screen repaints\"\n\n*As an alternative, in the same menu change the compositor to XRender\n\n*If you'd prefer to not do either of the above, create a script file in /etc/profile.d named kwin.sh (or anything ending .sh really). In that file place the line export KWIN_TRIPLE_BUFFER=1\nThis is recommended if your .xsession-errors file mentions that Triple Buffering is not available. To find this, I just opened the file in kwrite and searched for triple, sure enough it said not available. After making the file, that message is no longer present on subsequent reboots.\n\nA: I have flickering too. I also found that changing compositor settings fixed it, but only temporarily. The reason this worked is that it restarts the compositor. I don't have a full solution yet, but restarting the compositor with SHIFT+Alt+F12 twice is an efficient workaround.\n\nA: On my system Kubuntu 18.04 with NVIDIA proprietary driver none of the solution listed int he answer worked, for me disabling \"Sync to VBlank\" make the issue stop for now (a reboot was needed)\n\nA: had also that flickering with KDE on Kubuntu 15.10 running on a i5-3320M with integrated HD4000.\nit was really annoing my when i played games like mincraft in fullscreen.\nAfter i stopped the compositor, no Fullscreen flickering.\nI acutally set startup without the composer, that is my soulution.\nAll other methodes written above had no affect.\nMaybe this is a thing KDE developers need to fix, cause i read a lot about this on the net an many people using ivy-bridge cpu´s have this flickering problem.\nGreetings\n\nA: I had that problem very extremely with KDE Plasma 5.9.5 on Arch Linux in a VirtualBox guest VM. The problem seems to have been solved by\npacman -S virtualbox-guest-utils\nsystemctl enable vboxservice.service\n\n\nA: In case this helps anyone else searching for a similar issue: I had intermittent flickering in Kubuntu 15.10 on a Macbook Pro retina. The desktop would load without issue, however on around every other boot, at some point the display would start flickering when minimising/resizing windows.\nOption 1 'full screen repaints' fixed this for me.\n\nA: I have the same problem with intel drivers on Debian .\nIt's a PSR bug.\nSo you must disable it. \nIn Debian  I add in to\n/etc/default/grub: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\" i915.enable_psr=0\".\n\nAnd run \nsudo update-grub, to regenerate /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\n\n", "Q: Can't login to MySQL as root anymore? It looks like I can not login to MySQL (actually MariaDB) as root user anymore in Ubuntu 15.04 (I upgraded from 14.04 via 14.10)\nI already tried to reset the password.\nWhat is working, is sudo mysql - but I want to login as root from an other user using mysql -uroot -p. When I create a new user with full rights and password, it is working.\nWas there something changed?\n\nA: So you've gone from version 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1 to 10.0.20-0ubuntu0.15.04.1. Sounds scarier than it is, that's just what they called 5.6 for some reason.\nIt seems that newer versions of MariaDB have added a plugin to the user table to force authentication through a fixed path. In this case, the root database user is forced through the unix_socket plugin. This also seems to be known as auth_socket in some circles.\nAnyway this plugin restricts things so only the system root user can log in as the database root, with no password. It's a security choice they've made.\nYou can revert this by blanking the plugin field for the root user:\nshell$ sudo mysql -u root\n\n[mysql] use mysql;\n[mysql] update user set plugin='' where User='root';\n[mysql] flush privileges;\n\nA specified password should work after this.

And how many times the volume was mounted after the last check ?\n\n*I also would like to know why it's only on this server and not the others I have (there are configured almost identically except this one has logical volume) ? \n\n\nA: The dumpe2fs command is the one to get this information for you, so long as you're using an ext* filesystem. Ubuntu tends to use ext4 as default. I tend to use it with the -h option, to only output the summary. This contains the most useful information.\nTo get the info you require, type:\ndumpe2fs -h /dev/sda1\n\n'Mount count', and 'Maximum mount count' are the fields you're looking for, but 'Check interval' also influences disk checks based on time. I've found that if you cancel a disk check 'Maximum mount count' changes to -1, so no disk checking will take place based on number of mounts.\nTo change the maximum mount count or interval, use the tune2fs command the -c option controls max mount count, an -i controls interval. man tune2fs contains more info about this command.\n", "Q: How to install wlan driver mt7601u ? file(mt7601Usta.ko) is missing while doing it How to install wlan driver mt7601u ? file(mt7601Usta.ko) is missing while doing it?\ni am facing a problem while setting up wlan connection for my new mediatek wlan adapter . \nunable to setup the connection , while making it was showing that file is missing .\nwhen i replaced the file which is downloaded externally from online , it is prompting as a invalid file .\nhelp me to go wireless\n\nA: There's a PPA with this driver.

The parentheses capture those two groups as $1 and $2 respectively. The -l turns on automatic trailing newline removal (chomp) and adds a \\n to each print call. So, we print $1 to standard output and $2 to standard error and then redirect each to a different file. \nSince this is Perl, there's more than one way to do it. This is the same idea as Wayne_Yux's answer but simplified:\nperl -lane '@A=grep{$_==0}@F; @B=grep{$_!=0}@F;print STDERR \"@A\"; print \"@B\"' file > filex1 2>filex2\n\n\nAlternatively, a simpler grep -P:\ngrep -oP '^.+?(?=\\s0\\s)' file > filex1\ngrep -oP ' \\K0 .*' file > filex2\n\n\nA: Assuming once you get a 0 all the rest of fields are like this, you can say:\nawk -v FS=\" 0 \" '{print $1 > \"f1\"; gsub($1 \" \",\"\"); print > \"f2\"}' file\n\nThis sets the field separator to the string 0 and prints the first field (that is, up to the first 0) into the file f1. Then, it removes this first field from the original line and prints its result into the file f2.\n", "Q: Has anyone successfully installed CUDA 7.5 on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS x86_64?

If they don't, do the following\nsudo modprobe nvidia\n\n\n*Set Environment path variables\nexport PATH=/usr/local/cuda-7.5/bin:$PATH\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-7.5/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\n\n*Verify the driver version\ncat /proc/driver/nvidia/version`\n\n\n*Check CUDA driver version\nnvcc –V\n\n\n*Switch the lightdm back on again \nsudo service lightdm start\n\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F7 and login to the system through GUI\n\n*Create CUDA Samples, Go to NVIDIA_CUDA-7.5_Samples folder through terminal, then run following command:\nmake\ncd bin/x86_64/linux/release/\n./deviceQuery\n./bandwidthTest\n\nBoth tests should ultimately output a 'PASS' in terminal\n\n*Reboot the system\n\nA: There are two ways to install suiting CUDA-driver (for Optimus and else built-in graphics-chipsets on hybrid mainboards) - the first described here is the easiest and the second description is more cumbersome but effective too :\nA)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-355 nvidia-prime\nsudo reboot\n\nB)\nDescription of method B is here, but already older (explained by user dschinn1001) - this method B is more humblesome and can be risky, but not harmful. :\nHow can I Install Nvidia Driver GT 520 and Cuda 5.0 in Ubuntu13.04?\nThe beta-driver-package for Nvidia to download for Linux is here :\nhttp://www.nvidia.de/object/cuda_1_1_beta.html\nMethod A is more simple, but not clear, how it interacts with xscreensaver and method B is older, but the driver-package is updated too in recent time, and after method B is done, it should work better with xscreensaver conditioned that xscreensaver is installed. (I tested method B on 13.10 and this was working very good, even with xscreensaver. And I think the rest of this thread is up to the hardware.)\nIn addition and in reference to bumblebee with Optimus-graphics-chipsets these adjustments for bumblebee are necessary too :\nHow to set up nVidia Optimus/Bumblebee in 14.04\n\nA: Sounds like lp bug 1428972.\nUser fennytansy added a workaround in comment #10:\nsudo apt-get install libglew-dev libcheese7 libcheese-gtk23 libclutter-gst-2.0-0 libcogl15 libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 libclutter-1.0-0\n\nA: I rebooted Ubuntu today, and found there is another unmet dependency something like libcog15 : Depends: mesa-driver... (I cannot remember the full package name), so I used apt-get install to install the \"mesa-driver\". After that, CUDA 7.5 installed successfully.\nNote that my Kernel version is 3.19.0-28-generic and the gcc version is Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04, which is not found at CUDA 7.5 official documents. I will check if it really work.\n\nA: I successfully installed CUDA using the runfile method. It's a little trickier to setup because your primary graphics driver also has to be installed using the runfile method (See Here). \nTry installing just the driver. This can be done by using the runfile method. It will prompt you for each portion of the install and you can disable the GL libraries and toolkits. The unity control center has been giving me issues as well with due to the CUDA sample's need to use libGLU.so instead of libGL.so. This is an easy fix when building your own learning examples. \n\nA: I spent a full day seeking to use \"ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\" to update the NVIDIA drivers to version 352. Everything failed.\nAfter one install, the gpu-manager.log reported that the drivers were installed while Xorg.0.log would report the opposite.\nThe nouveau driver had been removed and blacklisted:\n     sudo apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n     cat /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau-nomodeset-jsrobin.conf \n        blacklist nouveau\n        options nouveau modeset=0\n        alias nouveau off\n        alias lbm-nouveau off\nI finally gave up and used a purely \"NVIDIA...bin\" solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Blacklisted nouveau, as shown above.\n\n*completely uninstalled the nouveau Xserver as cited above.\n\n*Set the system bios to have PCIe (the two nvidia cards) as primary and deactivated the mainboard HD4600 interface.\n\n*booted into recovery mode, activated network, then went to console mode.\n\n*Ran \"NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-352.41.run -uninstall\"  just to make sure nothing was left.\n\n*Deleted any old directories in /etc, /usr/local, that looked like a remnant of past cuda or nvidia installs.\n\n*Ran \"NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-352.41.run\" \n\n*Ran \"NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-352.41.run --check\" to verify that everything was correct (it was).\n\n*Then ran \"cuda_7.5.18_linux.run\" to complete the install.\nThings are currently working. Both monitors are up and working. Currently working on building the cuda sample files.\nBe certain to use the \"--help\" flags on the NVIDIA install bins.\nThe main reason I decided to go the bin route (along with one of the alternatives not working, is that the \"bin\" approach provides an easy route to recovery after a \"mesa\" OpenGL update.\n\n\nA: Try uninstalling the nvidia driver, and directly installing cuda without it.  On a fresh Ubuntu 14.04, I followed the instructions from the nvidia website.  Aside from verifying compatible versions of things (gcc, kernel), the instructions were:\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.5-18_amd64.deb \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cuda \n\nHappily, the correct nvidia driver was installed as a by-product of the steps above.\n\nA: I tried sudo su and apt-get install cuda instead of sudo apt-get install cuda. It worked.\n sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.5-18_amd64.deb\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo su\n apt-get install cuda\n\n\nA: Please refer to:\nhttps://github.com/astorfi/Caffe_Deep_Learning/blob/master/Installation/readme.md.\nIt is related to installation of Caffe in essence but it address the CUDA installation as well.\n\nA: -problems with lightdm log in ( login loop )\n-problems with driver istall ( \"Driver Installation failed: it appears, that a X server is running...\" )\nTo successfully install a NVidia CUDA Toolkit on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit I've just had to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a liveImage of Ubuntu on pendrive ( 8GB pen is enough ) -\nsuch a try will save a ton of nerves, before unsuccessful\ninstall on your host Linux system!!!\n\n*login on live session on pendrive ( \"Try Ubuntu, before install\"\n)\n\n*add sudo user at live session:  \nsudo adduser admin  ( #pass: admin1 )   \nsudo usermod -aG sudo admin\n\n*logout from live session, log in as #admin\n\n*download CUDA Toolkit from NVidia official site ( ~1.5GB )\n\n*change privileges for downloaded installer file ( DO NOT INSTALL\nAT THIS STEP! ):\nsudo chmod +x cuda_X.X.run\n\n*switch to console view:\nCtr+Alt+F1 ( to switch on terminal view )\nCtr+Alt+F7 ( to switch from terminal view to graphical server )\n\n*at console view ( Ctr+Alt+F1 ) log in:\nlogin: admin\npass: admin1\n\n*stop graphical running service:\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\n*check if graphical server is off - after switching Ctr+Alt+F7\n the monitor should be blank black, switch back on console view\n Ctr+Alt+F1\n\n*install CUDA Toolkit, with such configuration:\nsudo ./cuda_X.X.run\n( press 'q' for license read skip )\ndo not install OpenGL library\ndo not update system X configuration\nother options make yes and paths as default\n\n*turn on graphical server:\nsudo service lightdm start\n\n*log in as user ( if you automatically log in as #ubuntu at live\n session log out ):\nlogin: admin\npass: admin1\n\n*check whatever nvcc compiler works with provided simple\n parallel vector sum at GPU Blocks:\nsave vecSum.cu and book.h at new files, compile and run at terminal:\n/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin/nvcc vecSum.cu && clear && ./a.out\n\n*check console printout - it should be similar to:\n0.000000 + 0.000000 = 0.000000\n-1.100000 + 0.630000 = -0.000000\n\n-2.200000 + 2.520000 = 0.319985\n\n-3.300000 + 5.670000 = 2.119756\n-4.400000 + 10.080000 = 5.679756\n-5.500000 + 15.750000 = 10.250000\n-6.600000 + 22.680000 = 16.017500\n-7.700000 + 30.870001 = 23.170002\n-8.800000 + 40.320000 = 31.519997\n-9.900000 + 51.029999 = 41.129967\n\n\n*if everything went well on pendrive live session, do the same\non your host linux system\nP.S.

Setting the keyboard layout can be done with setxkbmap from your Xsession script before the line where you start the WindowManager.\nsetxkbmap -model sun_type7_usb -layout gb -option ctrl:swapcaps\n\nAs a bonus info, you can get all the available models, layouts etc. from these commands:\nlocalectl list-x11-keymap-models\nlocalectl list-x11-keymap-layouts\nlocalectl list-x11-keymap-variants [layout]\nlocalectl list-x11-keymap-options\n\nThese informations were primarily found at ArchWiki, where there is some more information about keyboards in general though it may differ a bit from Ubuntu.\n\nA: *\n\n*Try edit /etc/default/keyboard\nXKBMODEL=\"sun_type7_usb\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"gb\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"ctrl:swapcaps\"\n\n\n*To apply, Reboot or run:\nsudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change\n\nReference: man keyboard\n\nA: If the layout change works on the login screen, but breaks after logging in, it means that the same resources are intercepted by a third-party program.\nIn my case, it was the ibus daemon. It has its own layout settings. I found it by searching among open files by encoding, since I decided that this program should use encoding files:\nlsof | grep -i CP1251 | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq\n(CP1251 is my default locale :) utf-8 in your case)\nAmong browsers, openoffice, pulseaudio a demon ibus was discovered. After deleting it, the layout stopped breaking. (It can also be reconfigured to a non aggressive mode of operation)\n\nA: *\n\n*Unity has its own settings daemon that take care of layout setup, which reset any previous Xorg setup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check current setting:\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options\n\n\n*Then add ctrl:swapcaps to it and set it back.\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \"['ctrl:swapcaps']\"\n\n\n*Set layout to gb\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources [('xkb', 'gb')]\n\n\n\n*If it didn't work, disable keyboard plug-in of settings daemon\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.keyboard active false\n\nReference: Permanently set keyboard layout options with setxkbmap in gnome/unity\nBTW, You can use GUI tool instead of command line if you want, look for dconf-editor\n\nA: Have you try this:\n    gsettings set org.gnome.setting-daemon.keyboard.layout KEY=active VALUE=true\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: How to turn off screen (headless installation) How can I turn off screen?\nNone of the answers here helped me.

Can anyone help me update this app to the latest version freefilesync 7.1?\n\nA: The newest version, as can be seen on the official site is 7.6. To update you just have to extract the new version over the old directory. \nA better way to install and update freefilesync, would be to use the official ppa. This way you always have a version that is compatible with your current Ubuntu version.\nhttps://launchpad.net/~freefilesync/+archive/ubuntu/ffs\nThe process for installing the ppa is standard and described on the site I linked.\nAs of November 2015 the ppa is up to date, again.\n\nA: If you have Ubuntu 14.04 (or earlier) the most easy way is to use the Freefilesync PPA :\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:freefilesync/ffs\nsudo apt-get update\n\nWith this PPA FreeFileSync will automatically be updated when you run sudo apt-get upgrade (or when starting the Update Manager).\nSee here : What are PPAs and how do I use them? for more information about PPAs.\n", "Q: quickly run is not working This is my terminal answer after quickly run command.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"bin/browser\", line 35, in import browser\nFile \"/home/alen/browser/browser/init.py\", line 12, in from browser import BrowserWindow\nFile \"/home/alen/browser/browser/BrowserWindow.py\", line 32\nself.refreshbutton = self.builder.get_object(\"refreshbutton\")\n\nIndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level\n\nThere are another two lines of code in BrowserWindow.py I put:\ndef on_refreshbutton_clicked(self, widget): print \"refresh\";\n\nfor my button to work.\nWhat's wrong?\n\nA: \n2.5.

I installed Samba, LAMP (for subversion access), Firebird-SQL-Server and that's it. Everything works fine. We planed to change the physical PC to a virtual machine and I installed everything on a Hyper-VM system (running on a Windows Server 2008 R2 host). Everything here works fine, too. \nI updated both servers everytime with \"apt-get dist-upgrade\" and so I have Ubuntu 14.04.3 on them now. But since I updated to 14.04.3, I got problems with my network connections.\nThe issue is the same on both machines (physical an VM).\nWhen I try to access the Samba shares from my Windows notebook (or accessing subversion repositories), it works several minutes, and then the system crashes.\nOn the physical PC, I can't access via PuTTY (ssh) and I can't login at the PC itselfs. When I press the Numlock key on the keyboard, the LED doesn't changed the state.\nOn the VM, I can't access via PuTTY, but when I use the console, I still can controll the VM.

EDIT\nSeems to fix my life. Sort of. Governor is ondemand and my computer is no longer lethargic. The modprobe and rdmsr commands gave identical output, only that my CPU seemed fine before and after suspend. However, applications still appear to use an oddly high percentage of CPU use.\nThanks a lot for the help. I'd be happy to keep debugging.\n\nA: Your computer (typically Dell LapTops on battery after resume from suspend) might be suffering from a situation whereby sometimes Clock Modulation becomes enabled. In its current form the intel_pstate driver is incompatible with Clock Modulation and it will drive the target pstate to minimum, regardless of load.\nFor your computer the minimum pstate is 6 and I think your processor has the extra Clock Modulation percentage bit, for a minimum modulation percentage of 83.3%, so the expected CPU frequency would be about 525MHz.\nI believe the magnitude of this issue is not understood, and I am attempting to acquire supporting evidence (and I have a little now).\nI also believe that the issue occurs when using the acpi-cpufreq CPU scaling driver, but its response is completely different. So much so that the typical user would probably not even notice. (and I have no evidence to support that claim other than having the tested the response curve of the driver to various Modulation percentages.)\nWould you be willing do do the tests described in this answer? And also when using the acpi-cpufreq driver instead of the intel_pstate driver.\nIf you prefer to just get a fix and move on, then I would suggest disabling the intel_pstate driver, and your system will default to using the acpi-cpufreq driver.\nTo disable the intel_pstate driver edit, as sudo, /etc/default/grub and add intel_pstate=disable to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line. Example, with other stuff that I use:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"ipv6.disable=1 intel_pstate=disable net.ifnames=1 biosdevname=0 crashkernel=384M-:128M\"\n\nYou will need to run sudo update-grub afterwards.\n", "Q: udevadm trigger not permitted message on the screen The solution for the problem described is given in askubuntu, I tried booting with bootable USB.

If BIT doesn't find a config it will ask if you would like to restore it. Than you just need to choose the snapshot from which you would like to restore and hit enter.

Under what circumstances is a reboot of an Ubuntu system necessary? I often read in answers that after changes in the system the system is to be restarted, but is that absolutely necessary?\n\nA: I actually had a situation earlier today that proves this. Sometimes, there are residual things left over in the system after a change is made. For example, I had a user that was not able to access /dev/dsp despite having been added to the appropriate groups. There was a lock placed on it by the first user that accessed it. However, even after killing that user, the lock was still in place and the second user could not access it. However, after a reboot, both users were able to simultaneously use /dev/dsp without any conflict. Doing a reboot releases any residual things that could prevent changes from properly taking effect.\n\nA: The question should really be closed as primarily opinion based.\nThe fact is, it depends on what was updated, how exposed your system is to the open Internet, and what system services you have/need running.\nSimply installing new versions of a package does not result in the related services and applications being restarted. For example, if you are running Firefox while you install an updated package for it, then you will be notified within the browser when you switch back to it, that it needs to be restarted, after the update was installed. Likewise, the kernel itself needs to be \"restarted\" when updates are applied for it. Because the kernel is the lowest level above the hardware, you do need to reboot the system, for the new kernel to be loaded. For other services, they can be restarted without rebooting. An update to Unity or underlying libraries used by the services of the environment, will need you to log out and back in, to restart them. For system services, it may be possible to manually restart them after an update is applied, but doing so automatically could be very disruptive if you are trying to use the system.\nThe only way to know absolutely certain if a certain action is necessary, is to know what the changes are, and what your risk is for not performing that action. Security fixes obviously require more abrupt action than simple changes to other things, that you may never directly encounter. The more directly your computer is connected to the Internet, the more risk there is, as well. You'll have to consider all the variables, and make a decision whether to reboot now, or later, when you install updates.\n\nA: \nWhen is it necessary to reboot an Ubuntu system?\n\nA running machine and strictly when doing an update/upgrade? Probably never (but do read on). The Linux system is set up in such a way that after you updated the system where it would require a reboot to activate the new features (ie. read the kernel got changed; changes to apache, mysql only require a restart of the service) you can always keep working with the current state the system is on.\nNow if you want these new features active the easiest method of doing so is rebooting. But for all we care you keep working on this machine and reboot it the next weekend or the weekend after that. Or next christmas. Is it smart? Maybe not. But there is nobody stopping you from doing so. The system is smart enough to not accept the next update if the server has not rebooted yet. \nTo me the only reasons where a reboot is necessary is after first install or when doing maintenance where single user is required (think things like partitioning, fixing hard disk errors) or when some idiot ran the famous fork bomb (though that one could be fixed from the system itself). \nFor all other reboots to occur is at the grace of the administrator. And I can not call that \"necessary\".\n\nA: First of all, I appreciate this question because it will always be current.\nThe other answers are correct and very detailed - that is why I go short.  \nThere are scenarios where a reboot is necessary, like after installing a new kernel.\nThere are scenarios where it is recommended, like after the install of a new desktop.  \nIn most scenarios, like after installing or upgrading software rebooting is not necessary.\nWhenever you are in doubt I recommend to perform a restart, so you are on the safe side.\n\nA: *\n\n*After kernel panic;\n\n*After partitioning or filesystem modifications (more specifically, resizing root partition; I'd recommend to avoid resizing the hard drive from which you boot in general, regardless of partition; if you are resizing something external, like SD card or USB, no reboots necessary );\n\n*After kernel upgrade and security patches (although that [might not always be necessary];\n\n*After system became unresponsive for whatever reason, and you've no option but to use magic SYSRQ keys or hard reset\n\n*After making changes to some dconf schemas , depending on the way application may have been developed. Related answer\n\n*Your CPU is overheating (you don't wanna keep on roasting those cores, do you ?)\n\n\nA: There are generally two situations where a reboot is usually necessary:\n\n\n*\n\n*The kernel is upgraded.\n\n*libc (rather, glibc) is upgraded.\n\n\nThere is a mechanism for reloading the kernel without restarting (How can I upgrade my server's kernel without rebooting?). With glibc, the biggest problem is init. It is possible to restart init (see Restarting init without restarting the system).\nFor the average user, neither is recommended, and restarting is necessary.\nApparently, there exists a third case:\n\n\n*dbus has been upgraded. dbus-daemon is apparently incapable of restarting (from what I can understand of the discussion on this LWN article). And since a lot of things rely on DBus...\n\n\nA: Install the package debian-goodies:\nsudo apt-get install debian-goodies\n\nand run the command\nsudo checkrestart\n\nYou will see a list of services and now you have the choice:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart each service\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your system\n\n\n\n$ checkrestart\nFound 20 processes using old versions of upgraded files\n(15 distinct programs)\n(14 distinct packages)\n\nOf these, 12 seem to contain init scripts which can be used to restart them:\nThe following packages seem to have init scripts that could be used to restart them:\ngpm:\n        3044    /usr/sbin/gpm\nrpcbind:\n        2208    /sbin/rpcbind\nbind9:\n        8463    /usr/sbin/named\nopenssh-server:\n        22124   /usr/sbin/sshd\nntp:\n        4078    /usr/sbin/ntpd\ntftpd-hpa:\n        3417    /usr/sbin/in.tftpd\nuptimed:\n        2704    /usr/sbin/uptimed\ncron:\n        3019    /usr/sbin/cron\npostfix:\n        22145   /usr/lib/postfix/qmgr\n        8892    /usr/lib/postfix/master\nhddtemp:\n        3174    /usr/sbin/hddtemp\nautofs:\n        2792    /usr/sbin/automount\nopenbsd-inetd:\n        3254    /usr/sbin/inetd\n\nThese are the init scripts:\nservice gpm restart\nservice rpcbind restart\nservice bind9 restart\nservice ssh restart\nservice ntp restart\nservice tftpd-hpa restart\nservice uptimed restart\nservice cron restart\nservice postfix restart\nservice hddtemp restart\nservice autofs restart\nservice openbsd-inetd restart\n\nThese processes do not seem to have an associated init script to restart them:\nisc-dhcp-client:\n       3775    /sbin/dhclient\n\n\nA: Actually, it depends what you're trying to accomplish:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do an apt-get dist-upgrade and a new kernel comes in, and you want to activate it, you need a reboot.\n\n*If a new version of FireFox comes in, you obviously don't.\nAnd in between those two extremes are 50 shades of grey:\n\n;-)\n\nA: I can't think of any situations of where a reboot is absolutely necessary.\nReally, you can leave Ubuntu running indefinitely. It might get malware (because kernel and libc updates aren't applied) and it might panic or crash out... But what are avoiding those actually going to do for you?\nGiven the complexities of life, it might be more necessary to ignore the constant demands of computers, and sustain yourself in other ways. Like breathing, eating, loving... living.\nBut even then, are they absolutely necessary? Is your existence on this plane within the absolute definition of necessity? I honestly don't know. Bit of a weird question to ask.\n\nTo the two big-fat-joke-spoilers who downvoted this post and those that follow,\nThis question was incomplete, or at least open-ended. When you throw around words like necessary, you need to give a context. \nMany answers already assumed the OP meant highly desirable (in a technical sense), so posted answers that fit contexts like necessary to avoid being hacked or necessary if your computer crashes. They're good answers. Adding another wasn't really warranted.\nBut they say assumptions are the mother of all muck ups (or something like that anyway) so I peeled it back to absolute necessity. If you insist on using an old copy of 10.10, Time and Space will carry rolling on, as are their wonts.\nYou'll note I'm not recommending that position.\n", "Q: what is the difference between ubuntu openstack and openstack kilo to build a private cloud? I am trying to build a private cloud.\nI was wondering what is the difference between\nubuntu openstack using maas to build the machines http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/ubuntu-openstack\nwhich have some heavy prerequisites.\nAnd openstack kilo and it's previous versions https://www.openstack.org/software/kilo/\nwhich have no explicit prerequisites.\n\nA: I'm guessing that you're a little confused.  Ubuntu's website simply describes how you can install OpenStack on it.  (You could install OpenStack on some other flavor of Linux if you wanted to.)\nOpenStack Kilo is like saying Windows 7.  The \"7\" part tells you which version of Windows we're talking about.

I did\nsudo apt-get install cairo-dock\n\nAnd when it reinstalled, the app cache was still there. Is there any way that I can remove the entire cache? \n\nA: Even if you unninstall a program, the settings are kept under your $HOME/ in case you want to use them again. In the case of cairo-dock, there are stored under:\n/home/<yourusername>/.config/cairo-dock\n\nSo if you want to reset to defaults, all you need to do is open a terminal and run:\nrm -rvf ~/.config/cairo-dock\n\nThis will delete all the settings (without asking you for confirmation!) and when you re-run cairo-dock it will load with the default ones.\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't ask for password after booting I'm using Ubuntu 15.04 and already changed the settings refered to password.\nBut my PC doesn't ask for any when I start it.

(Intend to chainload Lubuntu from Syslinux/ISOlinux) I have installed Fatdog64 on a re-purposed laptop, and am trying to install Lubuntu alongside Fatdog in a multiboot setup. However, the Fatdog install is not recognized by the Ubuntu Minimal installer, and thus is not offering an option to multiboot into it with GRUB. I've had GRUB(2) nuked by Ubuntu updates before, and I've been practicing with Fatdog on a USB install, so I'm more comfortable with the Syslinux bootloader than GRUB. Thus, I'd like to install [L]Ubuntu without putting GRUB on the MBR.  \nI understand some about MBR and bootloading, having chained to/from GRUB, GRUB4dos, sys/isolinux, and Windows, but I realize I don't actually understand how Ubuntu boots, and if it must be booted from GRUB (and thus requiring GRUB somewhere on the system, and hence the PBR if not the MBR). I also know there is a \"Maintenance-Free\" custom GRUB screen how-to (help.ubuntu.com/community/MaintenanceFreeCustomGrub2Screen), but at this juncture I'd rather stick with the iso/syslinux setup so that I can reuse the knowledge in USB/CD booting setups I am concurrently utilizing.\nSince I want to keep Syslinux on the MBR (Master Boot Record), does GRUB need to go on the PBR (Partition Boot Record) where I installed Ubuntu, or does it just not get installed? \n\nA: Referencing the syslinux.org documentation, chain.c32 can direct booting to a particular bootloader and particular partition. In my case, Lubuntu booted by simply using ...\nCOM32 chain.c32 \nAPPEND hd0 5\ntext help\n   Boot into Lubuntu\nendtext\n\n... as Lubuntu created a logical partition and installed itself on the first partition therein (usually the first partition in a logical partition is designated the fifth partition).\nI believe this could be used to boot other OS installations by sending the boot sequence to the partition, and if necessary, specifying a loader (such as ntldr for windows)\nPerhaps my original question came from a confused perspective - I wanted to still chainload GRUB from syslinux. Although this [text above] answers how to boot into Lubuntu using the Syslinux I have as MBR bootloader, I'd still like to have GRUB (or GRUB2) on a different partition, so that I can play with that installation and learn by doing. I'm open to direction on how to do that, and will happily mark that as the answer to my question.\nEdit to add: Referencing this blog post, there are options to cross-chain-load many different boot loaders. I'm just trying to get Syslinux to chainload GRUB.\n", "Q: Only allow websites to use already installed fonts and not download their own in Firefox I have read a lot lately about fonts being malicious, and as a website can just download its own custom font onto your machine so that it can use it, it could exploit something with this and do something bad.\nSo I was wondering if in Firefox there is any way to make it so that websites aren't allowed to download their own fonts for use, but instead websites are only allowed to demand to use fonts already installed on the machine, and so that websites that want to download their own font are just given the default fonts?\nBecause I could just get all sites to use the same default fonts, but I find that that just looks ugly, one font can look lovely on one website, but horrible on another, so I would like to give them some ability to choose, but just restricted choosing for security reasons.\n\nOS Information:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\nCodename:   vivid\nFlavour: GNOME\nGNOME Version: 3.16\n\nPackage Information:\nfirefox:\n  Installed: 40.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.15.04.1\n  Candidate: 40.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.15.04.1\n  Version table:\n *** 40.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.15.04.1 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid-security/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     37.0+build2-0ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid/main amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: Given your username, I'm surprised you aren't using NoScript (emphasis mine):\n\nWhile its primary aim is preventing malicious JavaScript from running,\n  NoScript effectively blocks Java™, Silverlight™, Flash®, and other\n  plugins and embeddings (such HTML video/audio elements and\n  downloadable fonts) on sites you haven't explicitly whitelisted.\n\n", "Q: MX4 Pro Ubuntu Edition can't normal boot during the ubuntu OS update on my Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition I reboot the system after 5 minutes.

I have an HP laptop, and thought about going all Linux on it. The problem is that the UEFI on the laptop won't let me prioritize Linux, so it will always load the Windows boot loader if I don't hold F9 everytime it starts up. Even with Legacy boot mode ON, UEFI is still prioritized, and the Windows boot loader will boot first.\nI feel that UEFI is a set back, and I want to know if I can create a new partition table with no UEFI, just legacy BIOS. Could this cause my laptop to not be able to power on? Could my laptop still boot? Would some of the hardware (i.e. keyboard, touchpad, webcam, USB ports) stop working? Could Ubuntu still recognize my computer details (i.e. computer name, internal hardware, memory and storage) Could I reinstall Windows on a new partition table without buying a new key if I needed it?\nI don't think I'll go all Linux quite yet, though. I just want to know in case I do.\nThanks for any help! :-)\n\nA: You are confusing the terminology a bit.\nUEFI and BIOS are not partitioning schemes but refer to the style of firmware on your motherboard - specifically, UEFI is a replacement of BIOS, and brings new UEFI boot mode, but UEFI can still boot in the old BIOS boot mode too.\nThe distinction in partitioning schemes is DOS/MBR style partitions vs newer GPT style partitions.  GPT is a newer scheme that is not limited to 4 primary/extended partitions.\nTo boot in UEFI mode, you need to be using the GPT partition scheme and have an EFI partition.  However, if you use GPT partitions you do not need to boot in UEFI mode.  How you boot is a function of how the operating system has installed its boot manager.  Modern versions of Windows will automatically realise that you are using GPT and that the system is capable of UEFI boot and install a UEFI boot manager.  Depending on the version, Ubuntu may do this too.\nThere is nothing stopping you from repartitioning using DOS/MBR partitions, and re-installing Windows and Ubuntu.  It would force everything to boot in BIOS compatibility mode.  Note that you would need to reinstall Windows from its original installation disc, as the boot type is determined at installation.\nYou don't, however, need to do this to get dual-booting working between Windows and Ubuntu.  It's perfectly possible to dual-boot between Windows and Ubuntu, both using UEFI boot.  Many other questions on this site deal with this.  It can be difficult sorting out the problems, but there are no more problems than when we used to boot using MBR - in both cases Windows setup/repair liked to overwrite the existing boot manager with its own, making it necessary to re-install Grub's boot manager after running Windows setup.  In this case you just do it with EFI rather than an MBR boot manager.\nIf you do want to get UEFI working please ask a new question and give more information about your system and setup, but if you don't - the short answer is that you are welcome to repartition using DOS/MBR.\n\nA: \nI want to know if I can create a new partition table with no UEFI,\n  just legacy BIOS.\n\nThe partition table (the hard disk, really) has nothing to do with UEFI/BIOS. You would have to flash the firmware of the laptop. That is ... something I have never attempted, but look up coreboot.\n\nCould this cause my laptop to not be able to power on? Could my laptop\n  still boot? Would some of the hardware (i.e. keyboard, touchpad,\n  webcam, USB ports) stop working? Could Ubuntu still recognize my\n  computer details (i.e. computer name, internal hardware, memory and\n  storage)?\n\nCreating a new partition table will affect none of these (except in that it will wipe any software you installed, so Ubuntu will have to be reinstalled before it can detect anything - also, drivers).\n\nCould I reinstall Windows on a new partition table without\n  buying a new key if I needed it?\n\nPossibly. IIRC a Windows key can be reused if the hardware hasn't changed much, but you should really contact MS customer support.\n", "Q: How to I install the default Grub theme for ubuntu? I installed Ubuntu Mate on my Ubuntu 15.04 install just to try it out. It's pretty nifty, but it's replaced my minimal grub theme (with a purple background) with a gray-green menu I don't like in the least. I tried using Grub Customizer to change the look of Grub but I'm not having much success: the only theme that's available in Grub Customizer is the Ubuntu Mate one, and my efforts at a custom theme aren't working very well (for some reason my 1920x1080 wallpapers are not being properly rendered). Any thoughts on how I can get the minimalistic grub menu that comes with ubuntu unity back?\n\nA: The default theme is provided by plymouth-theme-ubuntu-logo.

However, adding sudo to that line disables the touchpad as intended.\nIs udev not executing this command with superuser permissions?\nUbuntu 15.04\n\nA: synclient depends on X server to work. See man synclient. So you need to define the DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY environment variables of the current running server.\nIf you are using just a single user account with simple server setup, try this:\nRUN+=\"/bin/sh -c 'DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/home/<username>/.Xauthority synclient TouchpadOff=1'\"\n\nChange <username> to your username.\n", "Q: I cannot open .sh file in ubuntu 15.04 I right click and into properties I allow the permision to run as a programe. But still cannot run it. It is still opening in text document file\n\nA: Double clicking an sh file won't execute it because sh files are really just text files containing terminal commands. It's always kind of annoyed me that certain files aren't able to be executed by double clicking them, but that's just the way Linux works. If you want to run the sh file, you need to use the terminal.\nPress ctrl + alt + T to open a terminal. Now there are two ways to execute an sh script from the terminal. One is done by cding to the parent directory and then running it from there, while the other way just points directly to the file. I'll show both of them below.\nFor these examples I'm using my own user name and path I made up. You have to specify the actual path to your sh file.\nBy using cd\ncd /home/zacharee/Downloads/program/\nsudo ./program.sh\n\nBy just putting in the full path:\nsudo /home/zacharee/Downloads/program/program.sh\n\nEither way will work fine.\nNow, if you really want to be able to double click executable scripts from your file browser to run them, you can try this:\nOpen Nautilus (the file browser) and open the File... menu. From here, select Preferences and go to the Behavior tab. There should be a dropdown menu option named something like Executable Text Files:.

I'm a relatively new linux\\ubuntu user and have run into a serious problem. My Ubuntu 15.4 installation won't boot.  I'm not sure why, but when I try to access the grub loader by holding down the shift key, nothing happens.  There I some files on the machine I need, so my thought was to boot from a USB drive, then recover the files.  I was able to boot the machine from the one bootable USB I had on-hand (which is V 13.10, I think), but now I can't access my files because I don't have ownership privilege.  I tried to use sudo from a terminal, but I still can't find my home directory with the files in it.  Is there any way to get enough privilege to recover my files?  Once I do that, I can either rebuild the operating system or replace the disk if it's bad.  \n\nA: Case 1: I think what went wrong with your bootable USB effort is you forgot to mount your old home folder if you created a separate partition for it.\nCase 2: If you didn't create a separate partition for home you need to mount the old root folder.\nOnce you have done that and you can see the folder but just not access the contents inside it, then you need to \nFor Case 1:\nsudo chown -R \"$USER\" /<MountPoint>/<OLDUSER>\n\nFor Case 2:\nsudo chown -R \"$USER\" /<MountPoint>/home/<OLDUSER> \n\nReplace  and  appropriately.\nThen you should be able to contents of  folder\n\nA: When booted with the Live OS, go to your hard drive with a file explorer.

If you must, use gksudo instead.\nsudo runs a command with superuser privileges, but does not change the home directory.  Graphical applications usually assume that the current home directory belongs to the current user, and that they are allowed to store (and refer back to) configuration files there.  However, if they do this under sudo, you'll have the root user trying to store files in your home directory, ending up with incorrect file permissions which will cause later problems.\nIt's possible your problems will go away immediately if you use gksudo instead, though you should check for root-owned files in your home directory anyway as they may cause further problems.\n", "Q: Strange problem: black screen when selecting live ubuntu or install ubuntu I've putted ubuntu to a flash drive and came to grub menu selected try ubuntu live the screen goes black with some words\"acpi pcc probe failed\" then the screen goes totally black,\n I've tested the monitor on another PC and it worked fine,\ni restarted the PC and came to grub menu again and selected install ubuntu first was the same as selected live ubuntu but the second the setup started fine!!!\n i installed the system and after i finished restarted the PC and again like the first time the screen goes black after i selected the system to boot ):\n i tried to select advanced options for ubuntu then start ubuntu in recovery mode there i selected resume normal boot and it worked and booted to ubuntu fine!!?\nbut i still wondering the reason to this problem??\nmy graphic card is radeon hd 5450 and the hard is gpt\ni tried before installing opensuse but it's the same issue!\n\nA: Solved,\ni tried pressing F6 on Grub boot menu and selected nomodeset in it work but\nafter installing Ubuntu and reboot the screen resolution are low 640x480 and the monitor is unknown!!\nnow trying something else\n", "Q: How to change Ubuntu server domain name?

I did, and the  output was similar to what I get when I ping from a client (I can copy over the exact output, but I'd have to do it by hand and I can't see it being helpful, this is the exact output pinging from a client):\n<client>:~# ping dell.local\nPING dell.local (10.0.2.6) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from 10.0.2.6: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.184 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.2.6: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.243 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.2.6: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.207 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.2.6: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.193 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.2.6: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=0.290 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.2.6: icmp_seq=6 ttl=64 time=0.233 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.2.6: icmp_seq=7 ttl=64 time=0.255 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.2.6: icmp_seq=8 ttl=64 time=0.227 ms\n^C\n\nEDIT 2:\n<user>@dell:/data# rpcinfo -p\n   program vers proto   port  service\n    100000    4   tcp    111  portmapper\n    100000    3   tcp    111  portmapper\n    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper\n    100000    4   udp    111  portmapper\n    100000    3   udp    111  portmapper\n    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper\n    100024    1   udp  58196  status\n    100024    1   tcp  57892  status\n    100003    2   tcp   2049  nfs\n    100003    3   tcp   2049  nfs\n    100003    4   tcp   2049  nfs\n    100227    2   tcp   2049\n    100227    3   tcp   2049\n    100003    2   udp   2049  nfs\n    100003    3   udp   2049  nfs\n    100003    4   udp   2049  nfs\n    100227    2   udp   2049\n    100227    3   udp   2049\n    100021    1   udp  47379  nlockmgr\n    100021    3   udp  47379  nlockmgr\n    100021    4   udp  47379  nlockmgr\n    100021    1   tcp  41662  nlockmgr\n    100021    3   tcp  41662  nlockmgr\n    100021    4   tcp  41662  nlockmgr\n    100005    1   udp  41182  mountd\n    100005    1   tcp  43363  mountd\n    100005    2   udp  59166  mountd\n    100005    2   tcp  59611  mountd\n    100005    3   udp  42491  mountd\n    100005    3   tcp  54650  mountd\n\nEDIT 3:\nHere is the contents of /etc/hosts on the client (replacing the client host name with 'client'):\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n127.0.1.1   client\n\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\nAnd on the server:\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n127.0.1.1   dell\n\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\nAnd here is /etc/exports on the server:\n/ 10.0.0.0/8(rw,fsid=0,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,sync,insecure)\n\nNote that, regarding the obvious security concerns with the above, this is a special purpose network that only I have physical access to, and to which only I know the wireless password.\n\nA: you can edit your /etc/hosts files and add a line like the example below: \n192.168.1.2  server.servername.com server\nThis makes \"server.servername.com\", and \"server\" resolve to the IP 192.168.1.2\nAlternatively you can install a DHCP server, I can send you to a good how to if thats your goal as well.\nALSO:  Be sure your ports are open, and all of the RPC services are running (portmapper, etc) \nTRY:\nrpcinfo -p\nmattcurry.com\n", "Q: Wanted: Drive Activity Light panel item for Lubuntu 14+ I am seeking a panel object of some kind which would put a flashing light on the panel for Lubuntu 14.04 LTS, for I have an elderly small screen laptop which has no drive activity lamp. \nLots of such for Windows, not finding it for GNOME/LXDE except for System Monitor, which is overkill for my taste. Just a flashing light on the panel, that's all I care for.\n\nA: I have a proposal to use keyboard indicators instead. You can find Disk-Indicator program on GitHub: https://github.com/MeanEYE/Disk-Indicator .\nDownload ZIP archive, unzip it somewhere. It needs to be compiled.\nIts Makefile has a glitch though - it treats warnings as errors, so it won't compile right away. But if you edit the 4th string of the Makefile:\nCOMPILE_FLAGS=-Wall -pedantic -Werror -D _DEFAULT_SOURCE\n\nand remove -Werror option from it, then it will compile properly. After editing it run make in the folder where this Makefile is located.\nconfig.sample file contains the settings: which LED should be used (Scroll Lock is the default), which events to track and which drive should be used. Make a copy of this file and edit this copy as needed. For example, I copied it into .config and here's my setting:\nled=x|scroll event=both device=sda\n\nSmall help file can be found on GitHub page or in the file README.md.\nNow run the program:\n./disk_indicator -c .config\n\nIf you insist on using the panel indicator or you have no LEDs on the keyboard, you can combine this program with an Indicator for Lock Keys which can be found here: https://launchpad.net/~tsbarnes/+archive/ubuntu/indicator-keylock . It places keyboard indicators on the panel and reacts to this Disk-Indicator program nicely. But it has a side effect - notifications on status change, which are annoying. These notifications can be suppressed - indicator developer provided the method. There's a hidden option to disable them:\ngsettings set apps.indicators.keylock notifications false\n\nAlso system notifications can be disabled completely, as described here: How to disable system tray notifications in 14.04?\nIndicator for Lock Keys is invisible by default, you should press Caps, and it will appear in the tray. Check the setting to show it always and switch to Scroll Lock tracking (both settings can be found in its Preferences).\nIcon in the tray may seem not very bright. It is located in /usr/share/icons/hicolor/22x22/status/scroll-lock-on.png and can be edited easily with Gimp.\n", "Q: mongstat Failed: not authorized on admin to execute command { serverStatus: 1, recordStats: 0 } After adding auth mongodb authentication , you can not use mongostat, with the following error : Failed: not authorized on admin to execute command {serverStatus: 1, recordStats: 0}\nIf you encounter this problem , the trouble to tell me how to solve Thank you\n\nA: With authentication enabled, you have to create a role (and a user with that role) that is sufficient to run mongostat.

The live-media filesystem is in an NTFS partition on the same (USB) drive.  grub2 does not have NTFS support built in.  When booting with Secure-Boot ON, grub2 will not load modules, so its \"search\" command is not able to find the NTFS partition, and it is unable to load the kernel and initrd from that partition.\nI have tried\n\n\n*\n\n*linux kernel live-media-path=path-to-casper-directory\n\n*linux (hd1,msdos1)/kernel live-media-path=(hd1,msdos5)/path-to-casper-directory\n\n*linux (hd1,msdos1)/kernel live-media=/dev/sdb5 live-media-path=/path-to-casper-directory\n\n*set root=hd1,msdos5\nlinux (hd1,msdos1)/kernel live-media-path=/path-to-casper-directory\n\nMost of those boot, but fail to copy the live-media filesystem to ram:\n    Begin copying live-media to ram...\n    Not enough memory (4GB > 187GB) to copy live-media to ram\n\n(this is an approximation of the messages in /var/log/casper.log)\nI've seen mention of the \"live-media=\" kernel option to specify the live-media device, but I've also seen mention of that option not working.

Long story short, I have an external USB hard drive formatted using a MBR partition table, and I want to install Ubuntu in UEFI mode in a ~23.40 GB unallocated space before a ~442.33 GB NTFS partition that I need to keep:\n\nTo install Ubuntu in UEFI mode I need the partition table of the drive to be formatted as gpt.\nI don't think there's an easy / direct way to convert a MBR partition table to a gpt partition table, so I'm also looking for the complicated / indirect way.\nFor example I think something can be done by noting down the NTFS partition start, writing the new partition table and adding the NTFS partition to the new partition table, but I've never done this and I have no idea where to start; furthermore I don't wish to try this for the first time in this case, since I'm not really confident with this stuff and I can't afford losing the NTFS partition I need to keep.\n\nA: There actually is an easy way to do it: Run gdisk on the disk and then type w to save the changes (which, if you do nothing else, consist of converting from MBR to GPT, which gdisk does automatically). That said, there are a few caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the disk is bootable, it will cease to be bootable after the conversion. Bootability can often be restored by installing a suitable boot loader. NTFS implies Windows, which would mean a conversion from BIOS-mode to EFI-mode booting. Making this change is possible, but is a bit tedious. Here is one page that describes how to do it. If the disk is strictly a data (non-boot) disk, then this issue isn't important for you.\n\n*If the final partition on the disk ends too close to the end of the disk, it may need to be shrunk by a small amount -- just a few sectors, normally, although many tools will require rounding to 1MiB units, so you may lose 1MiB or so. GParted often ignores tiny gaps like this, so it's unclear from your screen shot if you'd need to do this.\n\n*If the first partition begins too close to the start of the disk, its start point may need to be moved. That's obviously not the case for your disk.\n\n*Some meta-data, like partition type codes, won't be correctly converted. This isn't an issue for your disk.\n\n\nFor more on this subject, see my GPT fdisk documentation on MBR-to-GPT conversions. (Note: I'm the author of gdisk, which is installed by default with recent versions of Ubuntu; so that page can be considered official documentation.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Mac installation I would like to install Ubuntu 64 bit on Intel Mac with Yosemite. I would like to continue using both OS X and all the applications and Ubuntu.\nSince the latest version of Ubuntu allows double installation without partition, can I choose this option without loosing anything previously installed on my Mac?\n\nA: Yeah you can use both OS harmoniously.\nAll you need to do is freeing up some space to install Ubuntu.\nYou can do it either by using Disk Utility on OS X and shrink your working partition.\nOn El Captian it look like this.\n\nOr, you can let Live Ubuntu media to do it while installation by adjusting the slider (red circled), here it's showing Windows 7 but the procedure for OS X is exactly the same.\n\nThen install Ubuntu alongside OS X and by default GRUB will be installed. Select Ubuntu to use Ubuntu or OS X to use OS X.\nIf GRUB is not installed you still can boot into Ubuntu by pressing down your option key on the Macbook while booting.\n", "Q: How to get left edge scrolling on Ubuntu 14.04? How do I configure Ubuntu 14.04 to use left edge scrolling instead of right edge scrolling? My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 14R.\nEDIT\nubu@ubu:~$ synclient -l | grep 'Circ' \nCircularScrolling       = 0\nCircScrollDelta         = 0.1\nCircScrollTrigger       = 7\nCircularPad             = 0\n\n\nA: To enable left-edge scrolling, you can essentially follow @kos's suggestion. In my case i used something like:\nsynclient LTCornerButton=3 LBCornerButton=2 RTCornerButton=3 RBCornerButton=2 TapButton3=2 ClickFinger2=0 ClickFinger3=0 LockedDrags=0 VertEdgeScroll=1 HorizEdgeScroll=1 VertTwoFingerScroll=1 HorizTwoFingerScroll=1 CircularScrolling=1 CircScrollTrigger=1 PalmDetect=1 CircularPad=0\n\nThe left edge scrolling will be enabled in 'natural-mode' by default (I don't know why). But you can reverse this with a bit of effort.\nFirst thing to do is to get the xinput id of the touchpad. The following code will give you that:\nxinput list | egrep \"slave.*pointer\" | grep -v XTEST | sed -e 's/^.*id=//' -e 's/\\s.*$//'\n\nNow get the button-map of this device by:\nxinput get-button-map <id-num-here>\n\nThis should give you something like:\n  1 2 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\nNow, if the numbers are indeed in order, this means that the scrolling is not reversed. What we need to do to reverse the scrolling, is reverse numbers 4 and 5, which represent the scroll wheel. To do this:\nxinput set-button-map <id-num-here> 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \n\nNow you're left-edge scroll should work properly. \nIf you want to reverse it to original state, you can use the same command as above by giving the original order of sequence.\nAs you might notice, this comes with a price - that your right-edge scrolling is now reversed! As the OP notes below, this can be reversed again to normal by enabling natural scrolling on mouse and touchpad settings.\nSource: This excellent blog post!\n\nA: This works, however the scrolling type for circular scrolling is set by default to natural scrolling; see Ron's answer to invert the scrolling direction.\nCircular scrolling is disabled by default;\nFirst off, enable circular scrolling:\nsynclient CircularScrolling=1\n\n(synclient CircularScrolling=0 to disable it again)\nAt this point the circular scrolling should be set to be triggered on any edge;\nSet the circular scrolling to be trigged only on the left edge of the touchpad:\nsynclient CircScrollTrigger=7\n\n(synclient CircScrollTrigger=0 to set it to be triggered on any edge again)\nOther possible values for CircScrollTrigger from X.org are:\nOption \"CircScrollTrigger\" \"integer\"\nTrigger region on the touchpad to start circular scrolling\n0   All Edges\n1   Top Edge\n2   Top Right Corner\n3   Right Edge\n4   Bottom Right Corner\n5   Bottom Edge\n6   Bottom Left Corner\n7   Left Edge\n8   Top Left Corner\nProperty: \"Synaptics Circular Scrolling Trigger\"\n\nThis will work only until reboot; to make the changes permanent, add the commands to /etc/init/lightdm.conf after the line post-start script:\npost-start script\n    synclient CircularScrolling=1\n    synclient CircScrollTrigger=7\n    sleep 5\n    clear > /dev/tty7\nend script\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu update to 14.04 I wanted to update my Ubuntu 13.04 OS to 14.04 Os.

Also, i have tried to mount the .ISO file using various software, but my software center has gone nuts; it doesn't let me install any software. \n\nA: Yes it is definitely possible\nYou can also do it from installation cd/bootable usb it won't bother your windows installation.

The flash drive is formatted FAT32 (required for UEFI boot). If I extract the same file on a Windows PC to a USB drive everything works just fine. How come Windows can extract this file to my USB drive and Ubuntu can't?\n\nA: The files you are trying to copy are symbolic links that just points to other files.\nYour usb drive is formatted with FAT32 which do not support symbolic links, so you can not place one on the drive.\nTo know where the real files are open Nautilus (the file browser) right click on the file icon and select Properties, if it is a link, its Type will start with Link to, and its Link target will tell you where the real stuff is so you can copy them from their real location.\n", "Q: Which version ubuntu works best on a Mac?

Do you have advice about which version is best to use?\nUseful sources from which I can learn to operate Ubuntu ASAP are also very welcome. \nThanks! \n\nA: Give the specifications of the MacPro, you should find that the latest Long Term Support version 14.04, which can be gotten here, works well.  Ravan suggested some good resources above for installation help.  I would also suggest the Mac Installation wiki on ubuntu.com as well.\nAs for resources to learn to use Ubuntu, you will find it very intuitive, but askubuntu.com is one of the best places to find specific information and answers to questions. This tutorial is a great place to get started though. (It refers to older versions, but the principles remain the same.)

The trail is only cleared after viewing the activity overview (when super key is pressed on the keyboard).\nThis only happens on the centre display. The centre display is the only display to have a black bar at the top when viewed in display settings (I assume this means that it is the primary display).\nscreenshot: \n\n\nA: I was having the same issue which seems like it was being caused by trying to set my monitor positioning using xrandr.

When I've started IDLE via the dash, I can right-click on the icon and choose the 'Lock to Launcher' option. After clicking it, however, the option is still there, whereas it should have been replaced by the 'remove from Launcher' option. So, apparently, this does not work this way. Can I somehow create a custom file making a launcher icon for IDLE appear? The commands that happen when I start IDLE are\nstefan@stefan-HP-Pavilion-13-x360-PC:~$ ps ax -f | grep python\nstefan    2087  1922  0 12:30 ?

All the starter does is to execute /usr/bin/idle.\nDragging the icon from the dash directly to the launcher (as Jacob suggested) keeps it in the launcher. However, after clicking it, another icon appears which is different from the starter icon and which has the defect I'm describing here. Maybe that issue can be solved as well?\n\nA: The simplest solution\nHere's what you can do (simpler than you feared :) ):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Dash\n\n*Type Idle (or Idle3, depending on the version)\n\n*Drag the icon from Dash to the Unity Launcher:\n\nThen the right- click text sais:\n\n(Which is Dutch for: \"Remove from launcher\")\nThe command to run Idle\nTo complete the answer: the command to run Idle is:\n/usr/bin/idle\n\nor for  specific version(s) e.g.: /usr/bin/idle3, or: /usr/bin/idle-python3.4\nSimply look inside the .desktop file in /usr/share/applications in the line, starting with Exec= for the right command.\nPrevent an extra icon from Idle when it is launched\nIdle produces windows of the WM_CLASS \"Toplevel\". To make these windows appear under the same icon as you just put in th launcher, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the global idle.desktop file from /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications.\ncp /usr/share/applications/idle.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n\n\n*Open the file (drag it over an open gedit window).\n\n*Add to the bottom of the file the line:\n\n\n     StartupWMClass=Toplevel\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out and back in. From then on, all Idle windows will appear under one icon:\n\nThat's it...\n\nEDIT\nAs a result of the fact that windows of one WM_CLASS in principle only appear under one Launcher icon (at a time) in Unity, please note:\nAlthough the chances are practically none, grouping Toplevel windows under the Idle icon could show a downside in rare situations:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you run different versions of Idle at the same time (e.g. editing code for two python versions at the same time), all windows are grouped under the icon of the version that started first:\n\n\n*If you run python applications, using tkinter as a GUI (quite unusual these days), usually secundary windows are set as \"child\" of the main window by using wm_transient()\nIn \"unpolished\" applications (like Idle), this might not be the case. In such cases, the secondary window (\"Toplevel\" windows in tkinter), will also show up under the Idle icon, If Idle ran first.\nBut again, normally this will probably never happen, and if it does, it does no harm but what I described.\n", "Q: dependency problems prevent configuration of energytycoon On a virtual ubuntu box (15.04) I am trying to install a debian package using the following command\nsudo dpkg -i energytycoon_release1_package.deb\n\nwhich results in some errors:\nSelecting previously unselected package energytycoon.\n(Reading database ... 271927 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack energytycoon_release1_package.deb ...\nUnpacking energytycoon (1.0) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of energytycoon:\n energytycoon depends on libogremain-1.6.4.\n energytycoon depends on libois-1.2.0.\n\ndpkg: error processing package energytycoon (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus (3.10.1-0ubuntu5) ...\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils (0.22-1ubuntu3) ...\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon (0.5.1+15.04.20150202-0ubuntu1) ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index...\nProcessing triggers for mime-support (3.58ubuntu1) ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n energytycoon\n\nWhen I try to install one of the missing package, I get the following output: \n> sudo apt-get install libois-1.2.0\nReading package lists...

When Ubuntu Software Centre opens, search for \"gdebi\" and using Ubuntu's Software Centre install the gdebi package installer.\nStep 3: Go to your Download folder and Right click on the .deb file and select open with gdebi package installer and proceed with the installation.\nStep 4: Check your version number by going to \"Help\" -> \"About\"\nStep 5: Happy viewing\nWe think that the reason it doesn't come with a default API key and works out of the box is due to how it was originally packaged for the Ubuntu Software Centre. Additionally if you install the .deb package using the Ubuntu Software Centre (backend Gnome Software Centre) it will automatically default to the version that doesn't have an api key.

For animations synfig saves an image sequence if you choose a single image format.\nYou will need to do similar steps for 3d objects, render out the object to an image that you can then read with natron.

My computer at work has a tendency to generate an excessive amount of core files, which can be useful for debugging, but slowly take up all of the available space on my computer.

I think a better way would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use locate to find all the files starting with \"core.\"\n\n*Feed that list into file\n\n*Make a list out of everything that file says is a core file.

There's no one 'method' for it.  And you have to configure each and every bit for use in your setup and network requirements.\nIt's not as simple as 'install microsoft server, connect windows 7 to the domain'.

Not only as alternatives, but as substitutes. I am studying animation and digital arts and have got all the needed software for free, leaving Adobe and Autodesk 90% away of my life. Now I'm interested in using a free OS such as Ubuntu.\nFrom what I have read, everything I use so far is available for Ubuntu, except for my games. I currently run Ubuntu in a virtual machine and it looks pretty good for me. But a friend told me that installing only Ubuntu as my main OS may give me trouble or even get to damage physical parts of my computer, mostly because of the drivers.\nI would like to know if that is true. Despite any answer, I would like to know if there's any warranty I could get if I become a 100% Ubuntu user.\nI've been really enthusiastic after hearing about this free and professional OS and would appreciate your sincere answer a lot.\n\nA: Software can not destroy hardware, unless you connect a USB-powered explosive kit to your computer... \nThe only way how the system could damage your machine in a not reversible way is by overheating your devices, but before this happens, the BIOS will do an emergency shutdown to save your chips. And although Ubuntu has some minor problems with a handful of drivers, especially for graphic cards, which may lead to inefficient power and fan management, this is only very very rarely a problem and just leads to that described shutdown.\nBut I don't understand why your friend warns you from installing Ubuntu as only OS for that reason. It's completely irrelevant how the rest of the disk looks like, whether I dual-boot with other systems or not, the running system controls the computer. There is no difference in whether you still have Windows as second OS installed or not, as long as you're running Ubuntu, you're just plainly running Ubuntu.\nThere is no risk in damaging anything except your current data (which you always have when repartitioning your disk and installing a new system - not only with Ubuntu), but when you make a backup before running the installer, you're on the safe side.\nTo conclude: Ubuntu does not harm anybody or anything. If you like it, install it. It does not matter if you replace Windows with it or install both along each other on the same computer, do what you feel more comfortable with. Make sure you have got a current backup of your data and nothing bad will ruin your day! :) \n", "Q: How to set a custom page to replace the default Firefox New Tab page I am using Firefox 40, and I don't really like the New Tab page, so I would really like to set it to the DuckDuckGo homepage, how can this be achieved so that when I click the New Tab button I get the DuckDuckGo homepage?\nI have already done some research into this, but this is all that I found.

In case you're unfamiliar with the Toshiba Satellite Radius 11, it is EFI and has a GPT hard drive. I boot into the live USB and install Ubuntu using the default \"Erase hard disk and install Ubuntu\" option. I reboot and it usually boots. \nHowever, it is incredibly \"fragile\". For example, if the computer force shuts down, then the bootloader appears damaged, and the computer throws an error that it had nothing to boot into. To fix this, I need to boot into the Ubuntu live USB and run Boot Repair. Is there any way to fix this? \n\nA: My first suggestion is to edit your /etc/fstab file so that the EFI System Partition (ESP) mounts read-only, or even not at all. (You could set it so that it doesn't auto-mount, but can be mounted manually.) This will limit operations that involve updating the boot loader on the ESP, but those are few and far between -- mostly just GRUB updates. The idea behind this suggestion is that your uncontrolled shutdown may be leaving the ESP's FAT filesystem in a state to which your firmware objects. Mounting it read-only, or not at all, should prevent such problems from occurring. The big risk to this approach is that if you fail to mention a GRUB update, it won't be written properly to the ESP. In a worst-case scenario, the system might fail to boot; but a more likely scenario is that you'll continue to boot with an outdated GRUB.\nAnother suggestion is to prepare and learn better tools for recovery. You can put my rEFInd boot manager on a CD-R or USB flash drive and keep it ready. If this problem recurs, you could then use rEFInd to boot into Ubuntu, thus bypassing the need to boot a recovery disk. That might be enough to get it to boot correctly on the next reboot; and if not, you might be able to use efibootmgr to re-register GRUB with the firmware, if it's forgotten that. You'll need to learn to use some new tools, and figure out precisely what's happening that's causing your boot to fail, but the end result should be a quicker and easier recovery than running Boot Repair from an emergency disk.\n\nA: Fixed it!

For some reason, the machine hangs on shutdown and on standby. Specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Telling the machine to shutdown (e.g., sudo poweroff, sudo shutdown now, etc) causes the normal shutdown routine until the final line \"System will now halt.\" Once here, the system freezes and the only way I can get it to turn off is to manually hold down the power button for a few seconds for a hard shutdown.\n\n*Telling the machine to standby causes it to go to a black screen and become unresponsive. Only way to bring it back is to hold down the power button for a few seconds for a hard shutdown. After bring the machine back up, I get a \"System Error Detected\" notification on resume.\nA few pertinent notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The MBP is running an integrated intel iris pro and an AMD Radeon R9 M370X combo for graphics, and I'm using the proprietary driver from fglrx-updates. I know from other seemingly related cases in earlier versions of Ubuntu, the problem stems from the proprietary graphics driver. However, switching back to the open XOrg driver and apt-get purging fglrx-updates does not solve either problem.\n\n*If I try and hibernate instead of standby, the display goes back and returns back to the desktop a few moments later (as if it's waking itself from hibernate).\n\n*Reboot works fine. In fact, the only way I can get a clean shutdown on the machine from Ubuntu is to reboot and either shutdown from rEFInd or boot into OS X and shutdown.\nI'm not sure what logs make the most sense to post (it's my first time asking a question), but if anyone has any insights I would be happy to get the right ones posted ASAP.\nUPDATE 1: Putting it in standby actually causes the screen to turn off, then turn on almost immediately, then turnoff again and hang.

If anyone else is willing to confirm this patch on 14.04 with an earlier kernel release (3.X), please comment below.\nUPDATE: I can confirm that this works in Ubuntu 16.04 with Kernel v4.4.0-28-generic.

This can be done by running sudo -i followed by the individual lines.\n\necho LID0 > /proc/acpi/wakeup simply flips if LID0 should cause a wakeup or not.\n\nA sad side-effect is that the computer will no longer power on when the lid is opened\n", "Q: What's the definition of a linux distro? Disclamer: the question i am asking is what determines what linux distro i'm using not \"am i still useing ubuntu\" now for the question. I use to think that a linux distro was defined by its desktop environment, but now I have 7 desktop environments. Am I still useing ubuntu? Have I made a ubuntu dirivitive? I know some distros have difrent ways you install stuff like debien & ubuntu use apt-get, & arch uses pacman. So what i'm asking is what determins which linux distro you are useing?\n\nA: From Wikipedia:\n\nA Linux distribution (often called a distro for short) is an operating system made as a software collection based on the Linux kernel and, often, on a package management system.\n\nSo basically, a Linux distribution is a set of packages that creator selects for you. \n\n\n...but now I have 7 desktop environments. Am I still using Ubuntu?\n\nYes! Because even you have modified with desktop environments, the remaining set of softwares are still the safe.\nThe fun thing to note is, even if you modify all the softwares to match other distro, the name of Ubuntu will still be connected somewhere deep in the source code. ;)\n\nA: The desktop environment is what you see, the distro defines what 'is running in the background'.\nLinux is the kernel which manages everything from process scheduling to memory management.  \nA desktop environment gives the user an interface to talk with the kernel, which by itself talks to the computer hardware. Examples for known desktop environments are GNOME, KDE, XFCE.\nSo even if you are using different desktop environments you are still running the Ubuntu system.\n\nA: Linux distro is basically used for Linux distributions. When you decide to use Linux on your desktop, you need to choose a distro. Linux OS is developed by different organizations and people working on different parts.\nSystem services, graphical programs, terminal commands – many are developed independently from another. They’re all open-source software distributed in source code form.\nLinux distributions do the hard work for you, taking all the code from the open-source projects and compiling it for you, combining it into a single operating system you can boot up and install. They also make choices for you, such as choosing the default desktop environment, browser, and other software. Most distributions add their own finishing touches, such as themes and custom software – the Unity desktop environment Ubuntu provides, for example. \nFor more details - Source - http://www.howtogeek.com/132624/htg-explains-whats-a-linux-distro-and-how-are-they-different/\n", "Q: Cannot access text mode - black screen I am trying to install CUDA and Theano using this guide:\nBefore installing CUDA, it is recommended to switch to text mode and kill x server.

Security is probably the most essential reason to always stay up to date.\nUnwanted updates in your question I consider third-party updates being meant.\n\nYou can adjust this in the  Other software tab.\n\nA: There are different dimensions to the usual APT sources.\nFirstly, there's the repository:\n\n\n*\n\n*main\n\n*universe\n\n*restricted\n\n*multiverse\n\n\nThe choices of respository don't affect the importance of updates you receive, it just affects which software is supported.  You should have all of these selected, unless you know you are not using any software from one of these.\nIf you disable any of these, it effectively turns off all update support from any already-installed software you may have from that repository.\nSecondly, there's the classification of update:\n\n\n*\n\n*-security\n\n*-updates\n\n*-proposed\n\n*-backports\n\n\n\"-security\" should always be enabled, because it contains important security updates.\n\"-updates\" is optional but recommended.  It contains updates that may fix bugs but are not necessary for security patches.  You could disable it if you wanted fewer updates, but it tends to receive fewer updates than -security anyway. \n\"-proposed\" should usually be disabled.  It contains updates that have not been officially approved.\n\"-backports\" is a special one.  If you enable it, you gain the option of installing newer versions of installed software, but only if you do it manually.  If you never manually choose a software version from backports, you won't get any updates from it and having \"-backports\" source won't affect you, but if you do, it'll stay updated.\nThis is all a rather long-winded way of saying there's no magic bullet to reducing the number of package updates you receive.  The one viable option might be to disable \"-updates\", but that doesn't save you much.\n", "Q: What happens after the supported 9 months? For Lubuntu 15.04 version... What will happen after the 9 months supported time?\nWill we be \"out of the space\" with our today installation?\nWill we be able to upgrade to the new version without to lose our today installation?\nThanks for your help!!!\n\nA: In short, you'll stop getting fixes for security problems.\nWhen a security flaw is discovered in a piece of software during its security support lifetime, the vendor (Ubuntu) will endeavour to release an update to the software which fixes the security flaw.\nAfter the security support lifetime has elapsed, the vendor will no longer provide updates which fix security flaws, even if new security flaws are discovered.\nFrom your point of view, after the support lifetime elapses, you will not notice anything happening at first, except that software on your system will cease to receive updates, and this may leave your system vulnerable to security flaws even if they have been publicly reported.\nThus, it is important to upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu which is supported, so that you can continue to receive security updates.\nYou can upgrade Ubuntu at any time to the next version, or from one LTS version to the next LTS version, whether security support has ended or not, though it's a good idea to do so before that happens so as not to leave your system vulnerable.\nIf you choose to install the LTS version (the most current one of which is 14.04), this will receive support for 5 years, instead of the usual 9 months.  This is a better option if upgrading at least every 9 months is too frequent for you.\n", "Q: Stuck at \"Starting adaptive readahead daemon preload [OK]\" After upgrading to 14.04 from 12.04 my laptop (Asus X552c) got sluggish, especially when on Google chrome.

Using the bash shell's built-in string substitution capabilities to perform the latter step \npdftotext \"$file\" - | pcregrep -M \"${string// /\\\\s+}\"\n\n\nIf you can't use pcregrep then you might be able to get the output you want using plain grep with the -z switch: this tells grep to consider the input \"lines\" to be delimited by NUL characters rather than newlines - in this case, effectively making it treat the whole input as a single line.

Without it, you would get the entire contents of the file printed. \n\nAnother approach would be to use grep's -z switch which tells it to use \\0 instead of \\n to define lines. This means the entire input will be treated as a single \"line\" and you can use Perl compatible, or extended regular expressions to match it:\n$ printf 'foo\\nbar\\nbaz\\n' | grep -oPz 'foo\\nbar'\nfoo\nbar\n\nThis, however, won't help unless you know before hand how the string has been split into multiple lines.\n", "Q: IMAP mailbox not downloading files Summary: I have a university mailbox using IMAP protocol. My Ubuntu email clients do not download my inbox emails, not even the new ones. I can send emails though.\n\nI use thunderbird on Windows 7 (laptop) as well as the gmail app on my android smartphone and both of them sync with the server.

Both of them do not download the inbox emails but can send emails.

From memory the issue I was having was that INBOX was in one place and my folders were in another, and not contained in INBOX as thunderbird expected.  \nThat said, the best advice is probably to ask one of your University tech guru's how to correctly configure thunderbird, or some other IMAP client.  \n\nA: The university has two servers!

However, when I use it in Linux I have a problem. When I do not use the PC or watch a video, mouse sometimes generates short moves in response to touching the table or even people walking in the room. Those responses end screensaver and cause video player GUI to show. This is annoying.\nWhat can I do to counter it? \n\nA: A possible solution is the background script below. \nWhat it does\n\n\n*\n\n*After an (arbitrary) idle time, the script will disable the mouse, making it insensitive to whatever you do with it. I would set this relatively short, so there is little chance of disturbance in between.\n\n*A simple keystroke however (any) will enable the mouse again.\n\n\nSince xprintidle is triggered by either mouse- or keyboard events (not by what happens on screen), the script will not be disturbed by e.g. playing a movie.\nThat way, you won't have to fear an unwanted mouse action will disrupt anything, while you still have easy access to the controls and your computer.\nAs always (and as it should be with background scripts) the script is written in such a way that consumes practically no resources.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n# ---\n# set your device (mouse), as found from the command: xinput list\ndevice = 8\n# set the desired idle time (in seconds) to disable the mouse\nset_idletime = 5\n# ---\n\n# don't change anything below\nidle1 = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    idle2 = int(int(subprocess.check_output([\"xprintidle\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip())/1000)\n    if all([idle1 <= set_idletime, idle2 > set_idletime]):\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xinput\", \"set-prop\", str(device), \"Device Enabled\", \"0\"])\n    elif idle2 < idle1:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xinput\", \"set-prop\", str(device), \"Device Enabled\", \"1\"])\n    idle1 = idle2\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs xprintidle:\nsudo apt-get install xprintidle\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as mouse_toosensitive.py\n\n*Find out the device (number, integer) of your mouse by running in a terminal:\nxinput list\n\nIn the head section of the script, set both the device number and the desired idle time (see explanation in the script).\n\n*Test- run it by running it from a terminal window with the command:\npython3 /path/to/mouse_toosensitive.py\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your startup applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && python3 /path/to/mouse_toosensitive.py\"\n\n\nA: Of course I'm sure you have already experimented with the mouse controls such as:\nxset mouse\n$ xset mouse [speed] [threshold]\n\nand \nFind your input device number\n$ xinput\n$ xinput --set-prop 9 'Device Accel Constant Deceleration' 3\n\nIf experimenting with the available values there doesn't help, try changing your mouse pad to a surface that has more drag.  In other words experiment with different type of mouse pads for various sensitivities in that capacity.\n\nA: If you're using xscreensaver, there's a configuration parameter that fits right in - pointerHysteresis:\n\nIf the mouse moves less than this-many pixels in a second, ignore it (do not consider that to be \"activity.\") This is so that the screen doesn't un-blank (or fail to blank) just because you bumped the desk. Default: 10 pixels.\n\nAnother solution I would try is to buy a nice silicone mousepad which may reduce the unwanted motion to a minimum.\n\nA: Place an ink pen under the back of the mouse to lift the optical sensor above the distance where it will react to movement, remove ink pen when you want to use the mouse again.\n", "Q: Using AMD Graphics card I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 in my Lenovo Z51-70.

I would like to compile the Guest Additions from Virtual Box 4.2.12 on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS.

After countless hours of rebooting and reinstalling VMs and different Guest Additions I know with 100% certainty, regardless of the source of the bug, that 4.2.12 solved all my partial redraw issues in gvim.\nNow in a new 14.04 VM I am unable to compile 4.2.12 and am desperate to get it working.

Well there is a very obscure bug with either GTK or Guest Additions for Ubuntu under a Windows 7 host (both 64 bit, with 3D enabled). There are redraw issues in gvim when switching tabs (tabs do not redraw properly) and when moving through the file, where only partial updates happen. gvim is absolutely essential for my workflow.

Debian uses the deb package system, which all of its derivates adopted.\nYou can use the tool dpkg to install a .deb package on Ubuntu:\nsudo dpkg -i /path/to/package.deb\n\nIf possible, you should prefer software from an official repository or at least PPA that you can install with apt-get, aptitude or a GUI tool like the Software-Center or Synaptic.\n\nThe RPM (RedHat Package Management) system is a different package system for other Linux distributions, i.e. RedHat Linux and its derivates. They're incompatible with the deb packages used by Debian and Ubuntu.\nHowever, it's still sometimes possible to convert .rpm packages into .deb packages using the tool alien, so that you can install it. This fails for packages with deep system integration though, because those are often highly adapted to the specific distribution and therefore unable to run anywhere else.\n\nA: You can not install rpm package in Ubuntu. \nGet a deb package that exactly corresponds your Ubuntu version and architecture. \n", "Q: Error installing python-numpy On a virtual Linux box with Ubuntu 15.04 (freshly created) I am about to install python-numpy, but I get some error:\n>sudo apt-get install python-numpy \nReading package lists...

Unfortunately, it didn't work. I still see the Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable message.\nI tried to google around and look for a solution for this but no avail.

The file format and\n     configuration options are described in ssh_config(5).  Because of\n     the potential for abuse, this file must have strict permissions:\n     read/write for the user, and not writable by others.  It may be\n     group-writable provided that the group in question contains only\n     the user.\n\n ~/.ssh/identity\n ~/.ssh/id_dsa\n ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa\n ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n     Contains the private key for authentication.  These files contain\n     sensitive data and should be readable by the user but not acces‐\n     sible by others (read/write/execute).  ssh will simply ignore a\n     private key file if it is accessible by others.  It is possible\n     to specify a passphrase when generating the key which will be\n     used to encrypt the sensitive part of this file using 3DES.\n\nOther files like authorized_keys, known_hosts, etc. should be writable only by the user, but can be world-readable.\nGnuPG\n~/.gnupg (and contents) should be accessible only by you. With other permissions, GPG will complain about unsafe permissions.\n\nA: In general files and directory in your home should be owned by you.\nI have some strange root-owned files that are probably the result of executing sudo command; in fact there are programs that write things under $HOME (which well behaved programs requiring super-user privileges shouldn't do --- the effect is root taking ownership of files that should belongs to the user).\nNormally deleting or re-owning them (depending on the file) does not create problems and often it solves some, like the infamous .Xauthority file --- and sometimes, after running sudo dconf-editor, you have things in configurations you can't modify anymore. \nAbout special modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*scripts must be executable, of course, at least to the owner; \n\n*so must be directories too (where x means right to cross);\n\n*.ssh must be drwx------ (0700) and the private keys in it -rw------- (0600)\n\n*if you have a Public directory for sharing, it should be probably drwxr-xr-x (read permission to anyone) or drwxrwxrwt (with write permission and sticky bit, for enabling writing). \n\n\n...

Thanks.\n\nA: Your interfaces file asks both ethernet and wireless to start automatically. If the ethernet cable is detached, obviously it can't.\nMoreover, in a server, which usually runs headless, it is preferable to set a static IP address so that you can easily ssh and ftp into it. Therefor, I suggest that your interfaces file be set up like this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n#auto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.150\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nwpa-ssid <your_router>\nwpa-psk <your_wpa_key>\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 192.168.1.1\n\nBe sure to select a static address outside the range used by the DHCP server in the router, switch or other access point.

I used to use NEdit as a graphical text editor, but lately it no longer works right due to lack of maintenance. So I am looking for a replacement. Is there any graphical text editor that can send a selection of text directly to a shell command that is NOT defined in advance? \nIn NEdit, you select a chunk of text, tell it to filter it through a  shell, and have a window come up where you enter the shell command (for example awk '{print $1}') and immediately get back the output of that command in the editor.\nWhat other tool can be used to have the same functionality? \n\nA: With gVim, select the text, type :! and the command you want. The selected lines will be replaced by the output of the command.\nAn example:\nEditing /etc/apt/sources.list:\n\nSelected the text and pressed :! (the '<,'> in the command line is automatically added), with command awk '{print $3}':\n\nThe text was replaced with the output:\n\nOf course, Vim's regex is powerful enough that I wouldn't use an external program (especially not sed, probably not awk) with it. Some care has to be taken with the commands - % with various suffixes is used to add information about the file (:!echo % prints the path of the file, for example), so you'll have to escape those.\nNote that the :! command without a range (or selection) does not replace any lines.

To find out the window class of your running application, do the following:\n- Start the application\n- start a terminal\n- run \"xprop\" in the terminal\n- click on the program's window\nYou now get the window's properties printed in the terminal. Near the bottom should be a line \"WM_CLASS\". It contains one or more Strings, which are the window classes assigned to your program's window. Try to find one that is unique for your window (Wine applications seem to have \"Wine\" as one window class, which probably causes your windows to appear with the Wine icon, so take the other one if there is one).

I am dualbooting Windows 10 and Ubuntu. Both are running on the same hard drive, but on different partitions. When I am running Ubuntu I'm seeing my primary harddrive partition where the Windows OS is, in the Ubuntu launcher.\nWhen I rightclick this, it gives me the option of \"unlock from launcher\" or \"unmount\". What would happen if I unmounted this partition (where Windows 10 reads and writes)? It wouldn't damage my dualboot setup? \n\nA: Unmount option will disconnect your Windows partition from Ubuntu.\nIt will not damage anything on that partition. It is 100% safe.\n\nA: Ubuntu handles drives somewhat differently from how Windows does. Ubuntu has various devices available to be read from/written to; you can see a good chunk of them by running ls /dev in Terminal. \nYour drives (and their subsequent partitions) are accessible from a location assigned to them by the system, but it's usually something like /dev/sda1 or /dev/sdb3. While you can use these (and people do) it's a bit easier to remember what the partition or device is if it has a name to it.\nThus, the system will create a folder (usually in the /media/USERNAME directory) that allows you to access your files, and it will give it the label that the filesystem has for that partition or device. This is what is called mounting a filesystem. This will also prevent certain changes (like formatting the partition) from occurring.\nThus, when you tell Ubuntu to unmount the Windows filesystem, you're telling it to remove that /media/USERNAME/FILESYSTEMNAMEHERE link. It will also allow other things to be done to that filesystem if need be, but those aren't applicable to your question.\nTL;DR: No, unmounting the Windows 10 partition will not harm the files in any way, shape, or form. You're simply disconnecting those files from being quickly accessible for the time being (while you're using Ubuntu). It is purely a software-level change and will not affect the physical disk itself.\nIf you're still curious, go ahead and read this Q/A over on Unix & Linux. There are several very good explanations of what mounting/unmounting is and what it does in Linux.\n", "Q: Change the DHCP range for LXC without changing physical interfaces I am trying to change the DHCP range of my LXC containers.

I tried everything to make it go graphical but it just would not work.

My question is, I can still go into the old partition and copy files and place them on the new partition.

It can also be 'chroot'-ed though, I don't see you needing this.\nFor restoring individual software settings/etc you need to search for those individually. Most of what you need will simply be in your /home/(yourname) directory. NOTE:BACKUP your NEW /home/* area before starting any file copy/replace.(Or anywhere else you restore to.)\nExample:\nsudo tar -cvpzf new_home_backup_defaults.tar.gz /home\n\nThunderbird - data restore\nThunderbird linux default data location.\nIt says folder name can be different depending on version.So try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Thunderbird and open a shell cli ('Konsole' if in KDE)\n\n*In filemanager locate OLD mounted /home/(username) folder. Unhide hidden files.\n\n*Look for .mozilla-thunderbird OR .thunderbird\n\n*COPY entire hidden folder to new /home/(username)/ in Konsole based on above.\n Example: cp -r /mnt/oldpartition/home/(username)/.mozilla-thunderbird ~\n\n*Start Thunderbird.\n\n\nOther application settings:\nIf you see other apps not setup, slowly/carefully start restoring settings (hidden \".{appname}\" files or folders normally) from your OLD /home/(yourname) folder to the new one. This is probably the best place to start. (For instance '~/.mozilla' are user Firefox settings). DO NOT BLINDLY COPY ALL FILES - be especially careful with your X/startx/display manager settings. \nKubunut Vs Ubuntu\nThere is no difference between ubunutu and kubuntu in regards to where your /home/* folders are. EDIT: You added to your question - technically, yes, you could configure individual software from old partition data but why? Just copy the \"hidden dotfiles\" to your new partition /home. Kubuntu is just a KDE desktop instead of Gnome. Same overall distribution, different Display Manager (KDM) and desktop environment (KDE) by default.\nYour old partition backup\nPersonally, I would just backup the OLD partition assuming there is no damage or missing files - then just restore from that as needed (again, mounting backup as  read-only). Also, before restoring any /home/ files, backup your new /home/(yourname) area. (Or anywhere else you touch via restore)\nAfter backup is verified and depending on partition, you can also EITHER resize your new Kubuntu partition to use that partition as well (wipes it out), OR use the old partition as a new mount point - you can safely clear all data from it as you have a tested backup to restore things from.\n\n", "Q: Build with clang for older ubuntu releases So the problem started as I lately updated my Ubuntu Vivid (15.04).

Notification area is there but no keyboard layout indicator. \nBack to square 1.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04 Black Screen After Login I have a 2012 Asus Eee Pc running Ubuntu 14.04 With Xubuntu as the desktop environment. When I had 12.04 installed, if I suspended a session by closing the laptop lid, it would resume normally after start up. However now, it presents me with a login screen(sometimes twice) and then goes black. By pressing ctrl-atl-delete I can switch to another account, but not into my original login. Suspending by going to the power menu works normally.\nI've Googled the issue and I've uninstalled Light Locker thinking it would help. It worked once then the problem continued. \nMost of the solutions I've seen have to do with Nvidia drivers. This netbook uses an Intel Atom processor, so that can't be it.\nAny suggestions? Would switching to Lubuntu fix this?\n\nA: I think I fixed it. I changed the session to XCFE rather than Xubuntu and changed the power settings to suspend when the lid is closed. For now it works ok.\n", "Q: How to install NodeJS 4 using apt? How can I install NodeJS 4 on Ubuntu using apt-get utilities?\n\nA: Instructions were taken from here: https://github.com/nodesource/distributions\nwget -qO- https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -\n\nand then:\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n\nHere is the system versions:\nubuntu@424c7702-0947-e7c7-c532-dfec484fc109:~$ lsb_release -r\nRelease:    15.04\nubuntu@424c7702-0947-e7c7-c532-dfec484fc109:~$ node -v\nv4.0.0\nubuntu@424c7702-0947-e7c7-c532-dfec484fc109:~$ npm -v\n2.14.2\n\n\nA: Node Version Manager always has the latest\nI'm strongly of the opinion that installing Node with Node Version Manager is the best option on Ubuntu, if you're installing it on a computer where you intend to do development (instead of a production server).\nWhen you install through the official repositories, you end up with something terribly outdated. You can always add a PPA, but you'll still end up with messy permissions where globally installing modules from npm requires admin privileges.\nWith NVM, everything is kept in your home folder (so no need for sudo), and you can install multiple versions of Node (including 4.0) and switch between them with ease.\nInstallation with NVM\nTaken from the NVM installation instructions:\nGrab the latest copy of NVM (you may need to sudo apt-get install curl first):\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.26.1/install.sh | bash\n\nTell your shell to use nvm (you may want to add this to ~/.bashrc so it happens automatically in the future):\nsource ~/.nvm/nvm.sh\n\nThen install the latest node version:\nnvm install 4.0\n\nAnd tell nvm which version of Node you want to use:\nnvm use 4.0\n\nYou may also want to add the nvm use 4.0 line to your ~/.bashrc, so that you don't have to pick a node version each time you start your terminal.\nNow if you check which node it should give you a path to the node executable inside your home folder. Running node --version should tell you you're running v4.0.0.\n\nA: With kudus to @jarsever, I personally don't subscribe to the \"curl|sh\" paradigm. \nIf you feel the same kind of unease as I do when asked to just pipe some arbitrary text off the internet and into a root account's shell process, then you may want to try this for the same effect but with (slightly) less fear, uncertainty and doubt:\nversion=4\napt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 68576280\napt-add-repository 'deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_${version}.x precise main'\napt-get update\napt-get install nodejs\n\nI believe the process should be clear, and you can also do the same through Ubuntu's Software Properties UI.\n\nA: I like to use nodeenv from pypi (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nodeenv), you install the package using pip, then setup a \"node/virtualenv\" and tell it to install a prebuilt version, fast and simple.\nPaul\n\nA: This worked for me\necho 'export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc\n. ~/.bashrc\nmkdir ~/local\nmkdir ~/node-latest-install\ncd ~/node-latest-install\ncurl http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz | tar xz --strip-components=1\n./configure --prefix=~/local\nmake install \ncurl https://www.npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\n\nSource: https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 sometimes hangs on purple screen when booting My laptop (toshiba tecra m11) sometimes hangs on a purple screen when booting.

This question is a side-effect of Default owners/permissions of files in user home directory, and after a search which found this Q&A on Unix&Linux SE.\nWhen you use \nsudo command \n\nonly a bunch of environment variable are preserved, for security reasons (although this point here is debated... but well). It is a matter of configuration defaults to decide if $HOME is preserved or not; in Ubuntu by default it is preserved and you need to use sudo -H to not preserve it (and setting it to the target user). \nCheck it (be careful with quoting, we don't want $HOME be resolved before calling sudo!): \n[romano:~] % sudo bash -c 'echo $HOME'\n/home/romano\n[romano:~] % sudo -H bash -c 'echo $HOME'\n/root\n\nI can see that preserving $HOME has the possible negative effect that you can use sudo whatever and if the program writes or modify files in $HOME (configuration, whatever) you will end with a file owned by root and  subsequently not modifiable by the normal user. \nThis can wreak havoc especially with new users... we have quite a bit of login loops due to a root-owned .Xauthority due to a (admittedly crazy) sudo startx in a terminal emulator under X, or unmodifiable configuration settings due to a misguided sudo dconf-editor, and so on. \nOn the other side, I see no positive effects. So I am now running with \nDefaults        always_set_home\n\nin my /etc/sudoers(1), checking it: \n[romano:~] % sudo bash -c 'echo $HOME'\n/root\n\nThe question: What are the positive effects of preserving $HOME by default, if any? \n\nFootnotes \n(1) Always, always, edit /etc/sudoers with visudo and with a terminal (better a VC) with a sudo -i shell running. You will be grateful when you make some mistake cutting yourself out of superuser powers. \n\nA: You are correct in pointing out potential problems with sudo and applications that write files in $HOME.\nThe reason for this behaviour would not really be a conscious developer choice, but more that it wasn't really necessary for the intended purposes for which  sudo was first conceived: for use with simpler unix-style applications that just take some input and return some output in a predictable manner and then return.  It wouldn't originally have been designed to contend with larger applications that run interactively and manage their own files.\nAs rightly pointed out, sudo -i <command> is good for any application that's interactive (think of the i as standing for interactive, even though that's not what it stands for).  -i has further theoretical benefits over -H in that the target user's environment, eg .profile, is read too.\nThere's also gksudo <command> for graphical interactive applications, but sudo -i <command> works well enough for those too.\nIf you don't want to type sudo -i <command> all the time you could create a script/alias for it I guess.\n", "Q: wifi is not working in my laptop in ubuntu but in windows it is working In my Acer aspire e 15 e5-573-5108 wifi is not working is their any solution...\nthis is my wireless-test-info\n########## wireless info START ##########\n\nReport from: 11 Sep 2015 23:21 IST +0530\n\nBooted last: 11 Sep 2015 23:07 IST +0530\n\nScript from: 30 Apr 2015 17:23 UTC +0000\n\n##### release ###########################\n\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\nCodename:   vivid\n\n##### kernel ############################\n\nLinux 3.19.0-28-generic #30-Ubuntu SMP Mon Aug 31 15:52:51 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nParameters: ro, quiet, splash, vt.handoff=7\n\n##### desktop ###########################\n\nUbuntu\n\n##### lspci #############################\n\n02:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

Using the disk utility in OSX to create the other two partitions and rEFInd to work as my boot manager but I have run into some difficulties. I installed the rEFInd manager via ./install.sh and I would like to customize the theme but I cannot locate the file EFI in my Macintosh HD location. Any advice? I am also new to trying to create a triple boot so any other additional information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. \n\nA: If you used install.sh, without any options, to install rEFInd from OS X, then the rEFInd binary and support files ended up on your EFI System Partition (ESP), which OS X does not mount by default. Given your plans, the easiest way to access it is to wait until after you install Ubuntu. If you install Ubuntu in EFI mode, the ESP will be mounted at /boot/efi, and rEFInd will be in /boot/efi/EFI/refind. You should have no problems modifying the files from Ubuntu, although you'll need to use sudo to do anything with those files.\nAlternatively, you can mount the ESP in OS X. There are several ways to do this; one is:\nmkdir /Volumes/ESP\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/ESP\n\nNote that this example assumes that your ESP is /dev/disk0s1, which is the default location for the ESP on Mac systems. If you've repartitioned your disk from scratch with non-Apple software, it might be somewhere else. You can check with diskutil, gdisk, parted, GParted, or other tools to be sure you're using the right partition. (OS X's Disk Utility deliberately hides the ESP, though, so it's useless for this task.) Once you mount the ESP like this, rEFInd will be in /Volumes/ESP/EFI/refind.\nOne more point: Before proceeding with your Windows installation, you may want to read this question and its answers. If you created any FAT partitions with Disk Utility, that tool probably turned your disk into a hybrid MBR, which is an ugly and dangerous hack used by Apple to enable BIOS-mode booting of Windows. This might indeed be necessary, but Windows 8 and later often boot fine in EFI mode on Macs, and to do this, the disk must not have a hybrid MBR. Understanding the interactions between boot mode (EFI vs. BIOS) and partition table type (straight GPT, GPT with hybrid MBR, and straight MBR) will help you keep your hair as you set up a triple-boot on a Mac.\n", "Q: MAAS: 1.5.4 to 1.8.0 migrations issue I have attempted an upgrade from 1.5.4 to 1.8.0 (from the \"stable\" line of the PPA) on ULTS14 to go with an upgrade of Juju to 1.24.5 and I get the appended migration error.\nIs there a away to get it to progress beyond that point\nIs it possible to revert to 1.5.4 (or to 1.7.6 for example)?\nWhat can I do at this point?\nThe MAAS instance manages 12 physical servers which are used by a Juju instance.\nThere is some previous material suggesting a reinstall of the packages, and I tried that, but that did not change the outcome, which I think depends on a data migration issue.\nUpgrading MAAS from 1.5.4 to 1.7.0 or latest on ubuntu 14.04\nPython error during MAAS upgrade\n * Restarting PostgreSQL 9.3 database server\n   ...done.\nSyncing...\nCreating tables ...\nInstalling custom SQL ...\nInstalling indexes ...\nInstalled 0 object(s) from 0 fixture(s)\n\nSynced:\n > django.contrib.auth\n > django.contrib.contenttypes\n > django.contrib.sessions\n > django.contrib.sites\n > django.contrib.messages\n > django.contrib.staticfiles\n > piston\n > south\n\nNot synced (use migrations):\n - maasserver\n - metadataserver\n(use ./manage.py migrate to migrate these)\nRunning migrations for maasserver:\n - Migrating forwards to 0138_perf_index_on_node_events.\n > maasserver:0121_recompute_storage_size\nError in migration: maasserver:0121_recompute_storage_size\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n......\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/db/backends/util.py\", line 53, in execute\n    return self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\ndjango.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation \"metadataserver_noderesult\" does not exist\nLINE 1: ...\".\"name\", \"metadataserver_noderesult\".\"data\" FROM \"metadatas...\n\nTo study the state of the MAAS database I have used this SQL query and the results look plausible and consistent, so I guess that the upgrade did not damaged it:\nselect\n  m.mac_address                         as \"Ethernet\",\n  w.name                                as \"network\",\n  w.id                                  as \"netid\",\n  w.ip                                  as \"subnet\",\n  l.ip                                  as \"lease\",\n  w.default_gateway                     as \"gw\",\n  n.hostname                            as \"node\",\n  n.storage                             as \"storage\",\n  n.power_parameters                    as \"WoL\"\nfrom\n  maasserver_macaddress                 as m\n    left join maasserver_macaddress_networks as m2n\n    on m.id = m2n.macaddress_id\n      left join maasserver_network      as w\n      on m2n.network_id = w.id\n  left join maasserver_dhcplease        as l\n    on l.mac = m.mac_address\n      inner join maasserver_node        as n\n      on m.node_id = n.id\norder by\n  n.hostname,\n  w.ip,\n  m.mac_address\n\n\nA: It turns out that removing carefully the not-quite-installed 1.8.0 packages and installing 1.7.6 work as expected as per the tests already done.

How would I take this and turn it back into a Jar file?\n\nA: Assuming you've isolated the part of the email containing the base64-encoded file, the process for decoding the file is as follows:\nbase64 --decode < [in_filename] > [out_filename]\n\n...where [in_filename] is the name of the file containing the base64-encoded data and [out_filename] is the name of the file that will contain the decoded results.\nFor the curious, the base64 command is provided by the coreutils  package, which is considered an essential package and therefore should always be available.\n\nA: The uuencode / uudecode sisters are exactly what you want (to install do sudo apt-get install sharutils).\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by extracting the Base64 text from the attachment. Save it somewhere (for the example, it'll be at ~/attachment.jar.b64).\n\n*Open up a shell (and if necessary, cd to the right directory)\n\n*Run the below command to actually turn it into a Jarfile:\nuudecode -o attachment.jar attachment.jar.b64\n\n\n*Enjoy!\n\n", "Q: Muon Discover fails to find Wine Well, this is a beginners question. I am using my first personal Linux installation running Kubuntu 15.04.\nThere have been several software packages I couldn't find using Muon discover. In most cases I used the command line and/or installed some third-party source to solve the problem.\nHowever today I tried to install Wine... and Muon Discover couldn't find it. I can't believe that such a popular application is not available through the default sources.\nShould Muon Discover find Wine? If yes... what could be the problem? Why is Muon unable to find Wine?\n\nA: I think I found the answer by myself, by chance.\nMuon discover has an important option in its menu. It is called \"Show technical packages\" which is available in the popup options menu (the one with a wand like icon in the top right corner of the window).\nTo make it even more counter-intuitive... the option menu icon is only visible if you have already filtered out some packages by entering a search phrase.\nWine obviously is considered such a \"technical package\". So setting the checkbox shows wine... and a lot of other stuff.\nI wonder if this is the way it should behave.\n", "Q: Nokia Booklet 3G - Black Screen with underscore after Linux install my computer is Nokia Booklet 3G. I've tried to install Lubuntu and Ubuntu Mate. Both end up in same situtation. When the installation is ready, in the end it asks do you want to restart computer, I press yes and the computer restarts. I end up with black screen with blinking underscore. This happens with both installations.\nI've tried to reinstall Ubuntu Mate, but the installer crashes? (not sure how common is this yet).\nI also tried to wipe the harddrive with DBAN but it was SUPER SLOW. My hard drive is 160 GB and it literally took 6 hours to get 5% done. HDtune says my harddrive is okay (tested with MiniXP on HBCD).\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a different laptop.  Fact is, there are many laptops that reportedly won't let you install Ubuntu or other Linux Distro.  But the problem apparently isn't with Linux.\nIt's with Grub2.  There's something it does, or doesn't do. in the install process that cripples your PC.  Nobody has spelled this out yet, but there is an easy fix.\nDownload the Boot-Repair-Disk iso image file and burn it to a CD.  It should show up in a search of the internet.  After you've done a Linux install, reboot to this CD.  It will check your system, and if your laptop is like mine in this respect, it may tell you that it has to replace grub2.  I let it, and it later showed me on two screens the commands I had to enter in a terminal window to complete the job.  As I recall, you can copy and paste the commands.  You also have the option to open a terminal window while there.  The toolbar is on the bottom of the screen.\nThat was it.  I've had no problems in that regard since.  I'm using Ubuntu 14.04, which gave a black screen and blinking cursor right after I installed it.\nIt should not be necessary to wipe your hard drive.  In extreme cases, that means overwriting every part of the drive multiple times so as to virtually guarantee that whatever was there before is completely and utterly gone.  It should be enough just to format your hard drive, something that takes very little time with Linux because it does not do the whole drive, but only the part you need immediately.  Windows does it differently, so it takes a long time.  You have gparted (gnome partition editor) that you can run from the LiveCD for this purpose.  Or if going right into the install process, you can make changes to the hard drives and partitions as part of the install process by choosing the \"Something else\" choice that appears at the bottom of the page where you select the manner in which the install is to be done.\nBest choice for what to set up your partition(s) as is generally accepted as ext4.  You need one pzrtition to be root, meaning make it \"/\".  If more than one partition, you can either ignore the others, or designate one or more to other root folders.  I usually only do one as root and let the installer just add the others to the same partition (default).\nYou need a swap partition as well,  I'd say 16GB would be a good sizem but some might go more or less.  It makes uo for insufficient RAM sometimes, but if you have to use it, your machine will be very slow.  It's better to have more RAM is possible.\n160GB drive is not a whole lot.  For some people it would be more than enough.  But with Terabyte and more drives available for $85 and less, I would think seriously about replacing the one you have with a bigger one,  Just get the 2.5\" size.  They all have the same connectors, you just remove a plate on the bottom of the laptop and take the old one out, stick the new one in its place and put the plate back on.  Takes less than 5 minutes.  With a Terabyte drive, you could divide it into three partitions equally sized at about 315GB, have a good swap partition with the remainder, and have three separate, identical or different, operating systems in place.  Gives you lots of room to play around or grow in.\n", "Q: error loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.0.0 A whole pile of my applications are no longer launching (xchat, vmware, etc) with this error.\nxchat: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI did some searching and tried a few of the posts found (on this site and others) but I can't seem to get past this. I checked in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux_gnu -- assuming that is where it wants to find the file -- and sure enough there is no entry. I'm just not sure how to put it there.\nCan someone help?\n\nA: Reinstall the package libssl1.0.0\nsudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0:amd64  \n\nThe 64 bit shared library should be at\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.0.0\n\nwith a link to it at\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so  \n\nThe static library is at\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.a\n\nIf it's just the links missing, you can replace them yourself without doing a package reinstall.  \n\nLooks like the file was deleted (or moved --see if locate libssl.so.1 finds it).  Of course, the package manager would know nothing about that, so try the -f force on the install, and if that fails, try the apt-get  --reinstall switch.\n", "Q: Writable access for all users in fstab What should I change in this line so every user can have writable access: curlftpfs#root:12345@192.168.1.226/mnt/usbmounts/sda3 /media/MediaPlayer fuse rw,uid=1000,umask=0777,user,suid,allow_other,exec,auto,utf8  0   1\n\nA: For other readers:  fstab (all lowercase) stands for File System TABle, and is a file located in directory /etc (short for etcetera), so its path and name together are /etc/fstab.  This is a text file, so easily read and changed with a text editor like gedit or nano, two of the most popular, because they are easy to work with.\nEach line in /etc/fstab has a purpose.  They identify the device, by designation or UUID, its mount point, its type, its options (separated by commas), dump, and pass.  The lines below the labels are one device per line.  Spaces between fields are necessary, but the number can vary, do the fields do not necessarily line up under the column headers.  They just have to be in the right order, from left to right.\nTo change the contents, you have to have root privileges.  This means using the sudo command.  Research that one online if you want more info on  how to use it.  For more details on what you can do with /etc/fstab, do a \nsearch on fstab options.  Internet search with a search engine like google or bing and look for fstab options.  For what uid= is or does, I searched myself using fstab uid and found this linK:  https://superuser.com/questions/430707/how-do-i-configure-fstab-so-that-a-partition-can-be-used-by-different-users-simu\nFor your information, uid is short for UserID.  If it is there, it gives ownership of that device to one person,  If you had a gid= instead, it gives ownership of that device to one group and members of that group.  A gid=1000 makes more sense than uid=1000.  Getting rid of both means anybody that logs in can access the device,  But every folder and file has its own permissions settings, which still keeps your preserved content from being seen or used by others unless that is what you want.\nHowever, you are not completely out of the woods.  If someone gets sudo rights, can log in as root, or access your data from another install or boot process, say from a LiveCD or attached USB drive, they can access these devices via their own versions of /etc/fstab and root privileges.\nTo prevent this from ever happening, some people use encryption as a means of blinding others from getting into their own account's files. I say blind rather than block, because they are still all there.  You just can't make out what they say or do unless you have the decryption key to unravel the encryption process.\nBut what if you forget or lose the decryption key?  And of course there is a counter key, which is the encryption key.  You need both. Although with a simple binary method like XORing or switching the bits/bytes/words/quads around in a reverse direction way of doing things, the same key can serve both purposes.\nWhat does a key look like?  It's any string of characters that does not repeat itself over and over.  It could be a quotation, a passage from the Bible, a poem, even a long irrational numbered sequence.  Like PI, but that particular one is probably overused.  But there are other ones. Take the constant e for instance.  This is an irrational number that is part of our natural world and has been calculated out to an incredible number of places.  Here is a page on the internet where it has been carried out to 1,000 places:  http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/e_10000.html.\nNow suppose you searched for PI out to 1,000 places which you can find here:  http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/1000_places.html.\nNow suppose you mingled one set of digits with the other set of digits and come up with something entirely different from what either was originally.  You could alternate picking a digit, add digits in the same column alignment together and follow that with \"casting out nines\", meaning add any carry back in.  4 plus 7 equals 11, so you,add 1 plus 1 and get 2.  That becomes the new digit for that position.\nPI begins with 3, and e begins with 2, so what if these were taken as offsets into either or both tables?  After a few twists like this, the chances anybody would stumble on your method of coming up with a super long key would be greatly diminished. And all you have to do is collect both tables as files, run them through a program that works one against the other with rules that you devise, then stores the results where you alone know this is your encryption/decryption key.  Entering the key when you need it is just a matter of editing the file, doing a Select All, then a copy and paste into the encryption/decryption process.  If the 1,000 pr so digits is too much, cur off the excess at the beginning or the end.  Just as long as you commit the method of creating the key to memory, you can always do it again and again and get the same results.\nGoing from /etc/fstab to encryption/decryption seems like a huge leap, but it's all about increased vulnerability and what you can do to fight it  No encryption or decryption method is beyond reverse engineering, especially when done in computer code, but the matter of key generation can be beyond the vision and ability of anyone, unless they uncover your method of how you pick and link your sources for it together.\n\nA: OP answered:\nI removed uid=1000 and all work better now\n", "Q: Kubuntu: Chrome and Firefox Tab and bookmarks fonts are really tiny How do you make them bigger?

I adjusted other fonts in System Settings and they worked on other areas like the panel bar tabs and normal fonts on webpages.  The issue is the web tabs and bookmarks have no adjustments as far as I can find.\nThese small fonts are in all programs.

I do not focus specifically on how to install but the taxonomy of installations, so I am not aiming at some practical usage but the theory behind. \nThe first time I installed a programm on Linux, \nI used a graphic interface put in a keyword and clicked onto the program to install similar to android, \nthan I learned to open the Terminal and type \"sudo apt-get install xyz\"\nand it worked as long as the program was in one of the official sources, \nthan I stumpled upon programs that are not within the official sources, but are included in a so called PPA, a non-standard kind of source, in order to use it I had to add it by typing \"add-apt-repository ppa:somename/somename\", after this I had to update the sources and could install it same way I used with the standard sources before,\nthe last way of installing a program I met was called \"binaries\", it is said to do all the work manually like something called dependencies and such stuff which I did not master.  I would like to know if those are all possible Ways of installing in theory or if there are still others out there ? \n\nA: There are very many, as \"installing\" means more or less the same as \"copying a bunch of files with some side-processing\".\nBut broadly speaking there are two that you have already mentioned:\n\n\n*\n\n*From original \"program sources\", with explicit build and copy commands issued by yourself.\n\n*Using a \"package manager\", using \"packages\" built by yourself or someone else.\n\n\nIn both case where are dozens of variants.

Is this a bug or a configuration mistake?\nSamba Configuration:\n[global]\n   workgroup = WORKGROUP  \n   admin users = nick  \n   log level = all:2  \n   inherit permissions = yes  \n   inherit acls = yes  \n   map acl inherit = yes  \n   server string = %h  \n   dns proxy = no  \n   name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast  \n   interfaces = eth0  \n   bind interfaces only = yes  \n   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m  \n   max log size = 1000  \n   syslog = 0  \n   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d  \n   security = user  \n   encrypt passwords = true  \n   passdb backend = tdbsam  \n   obey pam restrictions = yes  \n   unix password sync = yes  \n   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u  \n   passwd chat = *Enter\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *Retype\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *password\\supdated\\ssuccessfully*  \n   pam password change = yes  \n   map to guest = bad user  \n   socket options = TCP_NODELAY  \n   usershare allow guests = no  \n\ninclude = /etc/samba/shares.conf\n\n[printers]  \n   comment = All Printers  \n   browseable = yes  \n   path = /var/spool/samba  \n   printable = yes  \n   guest ok = yes  \n   read only = yes  \n   create mask = 0700  \n\n[print$]  \n   comment = Printer Drivers  \n   path = /var/lib/samba/printers  \n   browseable = yes  \n   read only = yes  \n   guest ok = yes  \n\nShares Conf:\n[Home]\n   comment = Home Directory  \n   path = /home  \n   guest ok = no  \n   browseable = no  \n   writeable = yes  \n   inherit owner = yes  \n   inherit permissions = yes  \n   valid users = nick,brittany  \n\n[Shares]\n   comment = Default shares  \n   path = /shares  \n   guest ok = yes  \n   browseable = yes  \n   writeable = yes  \n   inherit acls = yes  \n   inherit permissions = no  \n   hide unreadable = yes  \n   directory mask = 755  \n   force directory mode = 1750  \n   force directory security mode = 700  \n   create mask = 755  \n   force create mode = 1750  \n   force security mode = 700  \n   security mask = 077  \n   directory security mask = 077  \n\n\nA: With the additional information you posted, it is a misconfiguration server side.\nThe behavior you are seeing is because the server is configured to allow fairly unrestricted access.\nUnder [Shares] you have \nguest ok = yes\nfrom http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-do-i-set-permissions-to-samba-shares.html\nguest ok: If this parameter is set to yes, the users will have access to the share without\nhaving to enter a password. This can pose security risk.\nDepending on how you wish to configure your share you have a number of options to be more restrictive.\nI suggest\nguest ok = no\n\nYou may also want \nbrowseable = no\n\nSort of depends on exactly what access you wish for which shares.\nSee\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba/SambaServerGuide\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-do-i-set-permissions-to-samba-shares.html\nhttp://beginlinux.com/blog/2010/01/samba-tutorial-create-private-user-shares/\nand How can I set up Samba shares to only be accessed by certain users?\n", "Q: Bind triple left click to mouse wheel click using xbindkeysrc? I want my middle mouse button, button 2, to create a triple left click event (highlight a line). When I use xbindkeys -n -v it registers the triple click event but it doesn't appear to work/register with anything else. I do restart xbindkeys in the background after testing with xbindkeys -n -v.\nBelow is the relevant line in my xbindkeysrc file:\n    \"xte 'mouseclick 1' 'mouseclick 1' 'mouseclick 1'\"\n    b:2\n\nAnd here is the output of xbinkeys -n -v\n    \"xte 'mouseclick 1' 'mouseclick 1' 'mouseclick 1'\"\nm:0x0 + b:2   (mouse)\n    got screen 0 for window 293\n    Start program with fork+exec call\n    Button press !\n    e.xbutton.button=1\n    e.xbutton.state=528\n    Button release !\n    e.xbutton.button=1\n    e.xbutton.state=784\n    Button press !\n    e.xbutton.button=1\n    e.xbutton.state=528\n    Button release !\n    e.xbutton.button=1\n    e.xbutton.state=784\n    Button press !\n    e.xbutton.button=1\n    e.xbutton.state=528\n    Button release !\n    e.xbutton.button=1\n   e.xbutton.state=784\n   Button release !\n   e.xbutton.button=2\n   e.xbutton.state=528\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The problem is that you're still holding down button 2 when button 1 is being sent, and the two interfere. You only need to change\n\nb:2\n\nto\n\nb:2+Release\n\n(i.e. execute upon release of button 2), and it should work.\n", "Q: failed to create symbolic link ‘/usr/local/bin/code’: File exists error while trying to setup VSCode I looked at the  microsoft docs but i am not good enough on terminal.\nIt says run this command:\nsudo ln -s /path/to/vscode/Code /usr/local/bin/code\n\nI customized it like this.

(Note: without the quotes)\n\n\nif the folder opens in visual studio code then that link you created perhaps unknowingly is working so your good to go, but if the folder doesn't open then that link is badly created.\nUse these steps to correct the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*run this from your terminal sudo rm -R /usr/local/bin/code\n\n*then rerun sudo ln -s /path/to/vscode/Code /usr/local/bin/code \n\n*now navigate to the folder you created previously from a terminal and try and run this from that folder 'sudo code .' (Note: without the quotes), it should launch vscode with that folder.\n\n\nPlease do and let me know if it helped.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall steam without the software center or the terminal The Ubuntu software centre force closes when I open it and the terminal will not install or remove anything due to an error.\nThe error message was:\nError: Opening the cache (E:Encountered a section with no Package: header, \nE:Problem with MergeList/var/lib/apt/lists/repo.steampowered.com_steam_dists_precise_steam_i18n_Translation-en,          \nE:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.)
