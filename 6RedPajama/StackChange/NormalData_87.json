["Q: Does Preload in conlict with other read-ahead type processes? I would assume not as Preload is installed to use idle priority. Though I wonder if it is a duplication of efforts with other processes installed in Ubuntu. Does anyone have any more information?\n\nA: Well I have been using preload for some years on all my ubuntu installations and never had any problems. And I'm quite prone to tinkering with the system.\nEven the launchpad preload bug's page does not list any direct conflicts.\nI would say you are safe.\n\nA: I ran it on Ubuntu 10.10 on a system that really needed performance as I was developing on it.  I was using LXDE as the desktop environment and I didn't notice any problems with it.  It had only 1Gb ram and 1.8Ghz processor.  I did notice things I used more frequently like chromium or mysql query browser did seem to start faster after a few days of using it.\n\nA: I'm not sure what the current status is. But back in 9.10 I had problems with really long boot and login times it turns out the preload just wasn't working at all and it wasn't just me, I found other threads where the preload package was just broken. It might be fixed now though.\n", "Q: Restore Gnome Bookmarks with passwords I have a bunch of bookmarks in my laptop, I know I can copy ~/.gtk-bookmarks to my desktop\nBut i have to re-entry all the passwords for ftp, ssh, etc...\nIs there a way i could restore the bookmarks along with theirs respective passwords.\nMy username/id is the same in both computers and both keyrings are unlocked on login.\nAny help?\n\nA: I believe these are stored in the Gnome Keyring with no technical connection to bookmarks. Try copying ~/.gnome2/keyrings from your old home directory to restore the entire keyring.\nYou can use Accessories -> Passwords and Encryption Keys afterwards to clean up any old passwords you don't use anymore.\n", "Q: Best alternative of Itunes for the use of iPods I have a large music collection on an external drive, and until I installed ubuntu, my preferred music player was Itunes. I am currently using Rythymbox. Is there a program that is better for listening, loading onto Ipods, and general organization?\n\nA: It's a question of personal preferences. I use both Rythmbox and Banshee and still don't know which one I like ;)\n\nA: I find Banshee to be an excellent Media player. It feels less like a utility than Rhythmbox does, however both are quite capable.\n\nA: There is always Amarok as well ... this, like RythmBox is a fairly heavy, full featured music player. Songbird is always an option as well, but the reviews don't seem to be good. \n\nA: My recommendation is Banshee, but it's a matter of your preference.\n\nA: Well linux is all about choices. Although you may have a very hard time exactly replacing itunes if you use ipods as well, in terms of music management there are many choices.\nClementine\nA QT based music player and manager. Available in the repos but may require ppa installation if you want the latest release.\n\nOther than this there are:\nXnoise\nwhich can be installed from ppa. \nBeatbox\nWhich is quite new and in heavy development. But can be installed from ppa.\n\nA: Try Exaile and Banshee, and search 'music' in the Ubuntu Software Center.  Let us know what you decide on.\n\nA: Rythmbox has come a long way since I first began looking for an iTune-Alternative.  Since the advent of the Ubuntu One Music store, I've gotten a lot more comfortable with purchasing and saving tracks for use with (yes, I said with) my iTunes library. If I had a non-apple MP3 player, I'd definitely go with Rythmbox.\nAs is, Rythmbox accurately detects and manages 'most' of my library when connected to my ipod.\nYou will still have issues with any proprietary tracks, but I've grown fond of it.\n\nA: Have a look at quodlibet ! -> http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/\nIt requires a bit of reading to fully see how awesome it is.\nI find it to be by far the most practical for large library.\nI tried them all, im sticking with this one.\n.. but it's a matter of your preference :D\n\nA: guayadeque  is really good too!\nFor more information see its SourceForge site and main site.\n\nA: As others have said, it's a matter of personal preference. You could run Songbird under WINE if you want to get the closest iTunes feel. \n\nA: Banshee allows you to save the ratings in the ID3 tags so you don't have to rate again when you move your collection. The only other player I know that's doing this is Songbird. But Songbird is no longer officially supported for Linux.\n\nA: gtkPod is also an app which I used to add music onto my iPod, but that was during the Karmic release, I have no idea how far Rhythmbox has come since then though.\n", "Q: How to recover deleted files? Are there any tools, methods, incantations to recover recently deleted files on Ubuntu?\nIf it makes any difference, I want to recover a Keepass 2.x database file. But would be better to have a method/tool that works on any kind of file.\n\nA: TestDisk / PhotoRec\nTestDisk can sometimes recover recently deleted files using PhotoRec, which is part of TestDisk. Available on official repo and newer version on their site.\n\nTestDisk is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software: certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.\nPhotoRec is part of TestDisk, and is a file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo Recovery name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.\n\n\nA: Try Scalpel\nsudo apt-get install scalpel\n\nfor more info\n\nman scalpel\n\n\nA: If using secondary internal HD (suspect the same for external HD) for recovered file import (from main HD, where the files originally were), it’s necessary to make a directory, into which the files will be put in on secondary HD.\nTo do it, you need to have BIOS setting for booting from CD first!\n1. Start Live Ubuntu Rescue-Remix CD, give command to boot, then when it boots into terminal, check your HDs by command – Code: sudo fdisk -l\nRealize what HD is main, and which is secondary, and what partition to check for files and into which to recover them – linux ext3 or Windows NTFS! Mine was Linux. Have enough room on it!\n(Then you can try to run Photorec (“sudo photorec”) and hopefully you’ll be able to see all your HDs. I was not that lucky, so I had to make directory and mount sec. HD.)\n\n\n*Make directory for recovered files first, e.g. – media/disk. Give command – Code: sudo mkdir /media/disk\nIf alright, terminal prompt simply returns.\n\n\n*Must mount secondary HD, or it’ll be invisible, even if “sudo fdisk -l” does show it. Give command for your secondary HD –\nCode: sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb2 /media/disk\nIf alright, terminal prompt simply returns.\n\n\n*Run Photorec by command – Code: \nsudo photorec\nGo thru settings, and only choose file types that you want, otherwise you’ll have thousands of files to sift thru!\nFor more details you may please visit: http:/www..ubuntumanual.org/posts/357/recover-your-deleted-files-in-ubuntu\n\nA: Autopsy and the Sleuthkit tools are great for recovering deleted files, with a user-friendly UI, as well as being available in the repos:\nsudo apt install autopsy\n\n\nA: Install scalpel\nsudo apt-get install scalpel\n\nEdit the scalpel.conf file and uncomment the file types you want to recover.\nCreate an empty folder (eg:recovered_data)\nFind the partition your data was. You can use lsblk to get the partition map.\nsudo lsblk\n\nRun scalpel (assume the data was in sda1)\nsudo scalpel -o recovered_data/ /dev/sda1\n\n\nA: If you deleted some file by accident but still know some strings which were written in that file you can use:\ngrep -a -B 25 -A 100 'containing string' /dev/sda1 > result.txt\n\n\nA: I have used foremost to recover damaged hard disk both under NTFS (windows), FAT32 (Flashcard from a Nokia phone), and ext3 with great results. Command-line only, but quite it's easy, something like this:\nsudo foremost -i /dev/sda -o <dir where recovered files will be stored>\n\nIt will order the recovered files on folders by file-type. Openoffice docs are recovered as zip files. As you need to execute it as root (in order to directly access the hardware), output files are also owned by root, so you will likely need to change their ownership afterward.\n\nA: extundelete is really great if your file system is ext3 or ext4.\nNote: extundelete requires you to unmount your drive to work properly (this is a good idea to do ASAP anyway, to avoid potentially overwriting the hopefully-recoverable bytes in the deleted files).\nUnmounting the drive on a live system can be tricky... you'll often get the 'device is busy' message.  To clear this 'properly' requires shutting down all processes accessing the file system.  But... you were likely working in your home directory, and a zillion processes are hooked into your home directory, so good luck with that.\nThe trick to getting around this is to do a 'lazy' unmount:\n$ mount\n/dev/sda7 on /home type ext4 (rw)\n$ sudo umount -l /home\n\nwhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*that example is for me prepping my /home mount for use with extundelete.  You obviously need to replace /home with your mount of interest\n\n*I did the mount command first to figure out what device (/dev/sda7) I need to pass to extundelete (output is truncated for brevity)\n\n*that is a lower case L in the -l option\n\n\nA: To recover the directory you can use extundelete \n\n\n*\n\n*Install extundelete\nsudo apt-get install extundelete\n\n\n*Command to recover\nsudo extundelete --restore-directory /home/Documents/ /dev/sda1\n\nNote: In place of dev/sda1 put your hardisk partition name.\n/home/Documents/ is your path to deleted directiory.\n\nA: R-Linux(Recovery studio) is one of the best. I have used this tool many times before. I worked at a company where they used the commercial version, 9/10 times it recovers everything you want. Truly superb application. I saved mine and my friends behind many times before.\n\nR-Linux is a free file recovery utility for the Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 FS\nfile system used in the Linux OS and several Unixes. R-Linux uses the\nsame InteligentScan technology as R-Studio, and flexible parameter\nsettings to provide the fastest and most reliable file recovery for\nthe Linux platform. However, unlike R-Studio, R-Linux cannot recover\ndata over a network or reconstruct RAIDs, or provide object copy.\n\nFeatures (from their website):\nR-Linux recover files:\n\n*\n\n*Removed by virus attack, power failure, or system crash;\n\n*After the partition with the files was reformatted, damaged, or deleted;\n\n*When the partition structure on a disk was changed or damaged. In this case, R-Linux can scan the disk trying to find previously existing partitions and restore files from found partitions.\n\n*From disks with bad sectors. In this case, R-Linux can first copy the entire disk or its part into an image file and then process the image file. This is especially useful when new bad sectors are constantly appearing on the disk, and the remaining information must be immediately saved.\n\nR-Linux Advanced features:\n\n*\n\n*Standard \"Windows Explorer\" - style interface.\n\n\n*Host OS:\n\n*\n\n*Linux variant: Linux, kernel 2.6 and above\n\n*Windows variant: Win2000, XP, 2003, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8\n\n\n\n*Supported file systems: Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 FS (Linux) only.\n\n\n*Recognition and parsing Dynamic (Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Win7), Basic, GPT, and BSD (UNIX) partitions layout schema and Apple partition map. Dynamic partitions over GPT are supported as well as dynamic partitions over MBR.\n\n\n*Creates image files for an entire hard drive, logical disk, or its part. Such image files can be processed like regular disks. Images can be either simple exact object copies (Plain images) compatible with the old versions of R-Linux, or compressed images that can be compressed, split into several parts, and password-protected. Such images are fully compatible with the images created by R-Drive Image, but incompatible with the old versions of R-Linux.\n\n\n*Recognizes localized names.\n\n\n*Recovered files can be saved on any (including network) disks accessible by the host operating system.\n\nA: Recently I used ext3grep to recover a large SQLite 3 file that was deleted from an ext3 file system.\nI had tried many other undelete tools, all which couldn't recover the file (from a dd image of the disk).\nIn order to use ext3grep, I needed to download and compile the source. Carefully reading http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlo17/howto/undelete_ext3.html from top to bottom in order to understand how the ext3 file system works and how to use the journal to find where deleted files use to be on the disk was also required.\nThis is not a simple solution, but very, very powerful. If you're prepared to invest a few hours to study the document and compile the program, it's well worth it.\n\nA: The Sleuth Kit\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleuth_Kit article on Wikipedia points to GUI tools, as well.\n", "Q: How do I make xinput mouse settings persistent for a USB mouse? I use xinput to change the settings of my USB mouse:\nxinput set-ptr-feedback 'USB Optical Mouse' 4 1 1\n\nHow can I make these settings persistent after unplugging the mouse or rebooting?\n\nA: You could cron the command or add it to your startup but neither are particularly elegant. If I were you, I'd add this to my udev rules and let the system detect events and fire off the command when it needs to.\nFirst we need the mouse vendor and product strings. You can find these through lsusb. Look for your mouse.

You can write your own or be cheeky and edit another one. There is a helpful little README in there too that I suggest you peruse (cat /lib/udev/rules.d/README).\nWhichever you do you want to add a rule like this.

You might not need xinput at all. Here's an example of a custom configuration for a mouse.\n\nA: I can think of no other solution than starting a little daemon that\nperiodically polls xinput --list and runs a command when a device is\nplugged in or removed.\nSample code:\n#! /bin/sh -x\n#\n# xievd [INTERVAL]\n#\n# Poll `xinput` device list every INTERVAL seconds (default: 10)\n# and run script in ~/.xievd/${device_name}.sh when a device is\n# plugged-in (or pulled out).\n#\n# The device name is the same as given by `xinput --list`, with\n# the following transformations applied:\n#   * any non-alphanumeric character is deleted (except: space, `_` and `-`)\n#   * leading and trailing spaces are removed\n#   * any sequence of 1 or more space chars is converted to a single `_`\n#\n\ninterval=${1:-10}\n\nscripts_dir=\"$HOME/.xievd\"\nif [ ! -d \"$scripts_dir\" ]; then\n  echo 1>&2 \"xievd: No scripts directory -- exiting.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nstate_dir=\"$(mktemp -t -d xievd.XXXXXX)\" \\\n  || { echo 1>&2 \"xievd: Cannot create state directory -- exiting.\"; exit 1; }\ntrap \"rm -rf $state_dir; exit;\" TERM QUIT INT ABRT\n\nprocess_xinput_device_list() {\n  touch \"${state_dir}/.timestamp\"\n\n  # find new devices and run \"start\" script\n  xinput --list --short \\\n    | fgrep slave \\\n    | sed -r -e 's/id=[0-9]+.+//;s/[^a-z0-9 _-]//ig;s/^ +//;s/ *$//;s/ +/_/g;' \\\n    | (while read device; do \n        if [ ! -e \"${state_dir}/${device}\" ]; then\n          # new device, run plug-in script\n          [ -x \"${scripts_dir}/${device}\" ] && \"${scripts_dir}/${device}\" start\n        fi\n        touch \"${state_dir}/${device}\"\n      done)\n\n  # find removed devices and run \"stop\" script\n  for d in \"$state_dir\"/*; do\n    if [ \"${state_dir}/.timestamp\" -nt \"$d\" ]; then\n      # device removed, run \"stop\" script\n      device=\"$(basename $d)\"\n      [ -x \"${scripts_dir}/${device}\" ] && \"${scripts_dir}/${device}\" stop\n      rm -f \"$d\"\n    fi\n  done\n}\n\n# main loop\nwhile true; do\n      process_xinput_device_list\n      sleep $interval\n      sleep 1\ndone\n\n# cleanup\nrm -rf \"$state_dir\"\n\nSave the code above in a xievd executable file somewhere in your PATH, add it\nto your startup applications, and then create a\n~/.xievd/USB_Optical_Mouse shell script:\n#! /bin/sh\nif [ \"$1\" = \"start\" ]; then\n  xinput set-ptr-feedback 'USB Optical Mouse' 4 1 1\nfi\n\n", "Q: Start ssh server on boot I've been doing my google-fu, but I can only find outdated guides or guides pertaining solely to the server variations of Ubuntu.\nI need to set it up so that ssh server is run on boot, so I can access the computer remotely without having to first physically log in on the host computer.

Why would it automatically install this?  I don't want my server saving power at the expense of performance.\n\nA: Frequency scaling isn't static. As soon as there is work to do, the CPU hops into action, P states boost up, and everything flies.\nIt's enabled because it's widely seen as a good thing. Saves you energy (good for your wallet and the environment). Keeps heat down (so important in a server room). And it's pretty unnoticeable.\nMoreover on modern Intel chips, if you have scaling on you can use \"turbo boost\" where one core will run at higher-than-stock speeds for a time. This is very useful for spikes of single-threaded work. Without scaling enabled, you don't get this.\n\nA: Ubuntu prior to 18.04\nInstead of disabling execution of the /etc/init.d/ondemand (as suggested by George) script you should use the this command\nsudo update-rc.d ondemand disable\n\nTo make the init system not start the script, this is the recognized way of doing it! Disabling the exec permission (sudo chmod -x /etc/init.d/ondemand) might be overwritten if the package is updated.\nUbuntu 18.04+\nUbuntu relocated this script to ondemand.service which execute /lib/systemd/set-cpufreq; use this command to disable the service\n~$ sudo systemctl disable ondemand\nRemoved /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ondemand.service.\n\n\nA: Set all CPUs to performance governor:\nfor GOVERNOR in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; \\\ndo \\\n    echo \"performance\" | sudo tee $GOVERNOR; \\\ndone\n\nAll supported governors by Linux kernel:\n\n\n*\n\n*performance Run the CPU at the maximum frequency.\n\n*powersave Run the CPU at the minimum frequency.\n\n*userspace Run the CPU at user specified frequencies.\n\n*ondemand Scales the frequency dynamically according to current load. Jumps to the highest frequency and then possibly back off as the idle time increases.\n\n*conservative Scales the frequency dynamically according to current load. Scales the frequency more gradually than ondemand.\n\n*schedutil Scheduler-driven CPU frequency selection\n\n\nSee https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/governors.txt\n\nA: You could install the rcconf debian tool:\nsudo apt-get install rcconf\n\nthen disable the \"ondemand\" service from there.\n\nA: On some systems, the 'ondemand' governor is unfortunately broken.\nThis is the case for \"Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad  CPU   Q9300  @ 2.50GHz\" and kernel 2.6.32-42.\nThe kernel thinks it can set the frequency individually for each CPU while the hardware actually only allows setting the frequency on groups of several CPUs (e.g. CPU 0 and 1 together, and CPU 2 and 3 together).\nYou may find out that the kernel isn't aware of this by looking at the /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/affected_cpus files which contain \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\" instead of \"0 1\", \"0 1\", \"2 3\", \"2 3\".\nThe visible effect of this missmatch is a single-threaded process that starts running full speed on one CPU (the 'ondemand' governor reacts fast), and then, after about 20 seconds (depends on setting details), looses some of its speed.\nThe reason is the OS, with the 'ondemand' governor, periodically reapplies low freqs on the idle CPUs, not expecting that it will also implicitly change the freq of our busy CPU. It's not even visible when you look at /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/*cur_freq or /proc/cpuinfo, the OS is just not aware of it!\nSo, on these systems the solution is to switch back to the simple 'performance' governor.\nPS: In my case, running the CPUs constantly at their full freq didn't change anything concerning fan noise. I suppose when a CPU is idling, a lower or higher frequency will not have much impact on its power usage.\n\nA: To make all CPUs run at maximum performance continually on a Ubuntu desktop or server, run:\nsudo chmod -x /etc/init.d/ondemand\n\nat the shell prompt and enter your password.\nThis disables the shell script that makes all CPUs run at speed \"OnDemand\", making them default to full speed (Performance).  You will need to reboot for this to take effect.\nI have only tested this in Ubuntu Jaunty 9.04, but it should work and not cause any problems on any version of Ubuntu.\nI think the Ubuntu defaults are strange for this.  A desktop or server should run at full speed, in my opinion.\nRegards,\nGeorge\n\nA: I have a new processor AMD Athlon II X4 631 (Fusion processor for socket FM1) and it doesn't save any energy whatsoever (I looked it with energy meter)! I don't have a turbo core, so I don't need ondemand setting. Most new processors save enery by themselves.\nWhen benchmarking, there is a little difference, in the range on 1-2%, when comparing ondemand and performance setting.\n\nA: This is old, but since no one mentioned it, and for the sake of completeness, I will add that the argument how CPU which runs on the maximum speed will waste power, produce heat, fan noise etc. is WRONG.\nAlmost all modern CPUs, especially Desktop / Server CPUs, will enter deep sleep mode when idle (google race to idle.).\nVoltage scaling will probably save more power, so on laptops this could increase running time a little, but on desktop and servers running performance governor will be fine for most of 'normal' users (who don't run server farms or similar.).\nI use performance gov with my i7-2600k and the CPU temperature is usually around 30 C.\n", "Q: Will the new open source Broadcom drivers be available in the current LTS release?

It provides you with a ID and password to connect with from your workplace. you can also setup TeamViewer in Ubuntu to autostart in background, autohide notification, setup a single permanent password etc. Have a look at the options, there is a lot to configure and very straight forward.\n\nA: The protocol that Windows desktop sharing uses is called RDP. There is an RDP server implementation for Linux called xrdp but development has fallen behind and the RDP client in Windows 7 won't talk to the older version of RDP that it uses.\nSo if you want to connect to xrdp from Windows 7 you have to copy the old RDP client (mstsc.exe and mstscax.dll) from a WinXP install to the Windows 7 box and run it independently. At that point you might as well just be using a VNC client instead, really. VNC servers for Linux are much better-supported.\n\nA: install remote desktop support on your ubuntu machine\nsudo apt-get install xrdp\n\nConnect from your Windows machine with regular remote desktop application.\nReference: http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/05/connect-to-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin-via-windows-remote-desktop/\n\nA: I believe you can use various VNC applications on Windows that are compatible with the built in one on Ubuntu. I really can not recommend any specific ones, as I have not used them since 2005. Remember to go to System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop to set it up if Ubuntu is the guest.\n\nA: I can attest that you can use vnc in windows 7 to connect to an ubuntu host just fine.  I use the regular old VNC viewer.  There really isn't a feature difference that I can see between doing this and using remote desktop.\n\nA: The most user friendly solution, that requires practically no set up at all, is an application called teamviewer\ninstall a client on every machine you want to access and your off. It runs over port 80 so theres usually no firewall config necessary. A few caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*its not foss (although it is free as in beer)\n\n*it runs over the web (even for connections on the local network) and the data it sends in unencrypted, so its not suitable if your transferring anything sensitive.\n\n\nthe company i used to work for used it quite a lot for remote support at work\n\nA: I've administrated Windows servers from my Ubuntu 10.04 laptop using the default Terminal Connection client. The only problem I see is that you are limited to either standard 4:3 resolutions or full screen, but nothing in between. So on my 16:9 laptop screen, the 4:3 resolution does not work well. Using the version 7 Windows RDP client that is installed with Windows 7, you can many options on resolution but also how you want to send over the details of the remote desktop from sound, usb, added desktop visuals. \nThe larger problem is from Windows 7 you will need to make sure you enable Remote Desktop, give your account remote access, also if needed allow from Windows Firewall.\nFor basic needs I think the Linux Terminal Connection client works well enough. Keep in mind that the future version of Windows RDP client will support more features such as sending 3D processed video using the remote computer's video card. These features will not work with non-Microsoft RDP cllients, except for approved third party vendors like Citrix. \n\nA: Another cool option you can use is download the software called Synergy on both systems. It is completely free and all you have to do is say setup the one running on Windows as the server and the one on Ubuntu as the client. In the server side you have to just drag a computer to whatever side you want and name it the same as the computer's actually name. After that just go to the client computer and type in the server computer's IP and it will automatically connect. You just have to keep internet connection for both and its a good idea to set both the server and client Synergy programs to auto start at bootup.\n\nA: ThinLinc can let you access Ubuntu from other systems. We have clients for Windows, Linux, Solaris and OS X. Note that it is a partially proprietary solution though.\nIt is primarily designed for full remote desktop servers, but it works fine for simple remote access as well. Usage is free for up to 10 users.\nYou can download it here:\nhttp://www.cendio.com\nAnd there is information in the Ubuntu wiki about setting it up:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ThinLinc\n\nA: The Windows 7 remote desktop viewer that comes installed with the os will only connect to windows machines using the rdp protocol. I agree with most of the others that it would probably be best to install a VNC viewer on the Windows computer and use the vnc sharing built in to Ubuntu 12.04. Also this will allow you to connect to your remote Ubuntu machine from anywhere if you configure port forwarding on the router. For a quick guide with screenshots on how to set up vnc sharing on Ubuntu 12.04 follow this link: UbuntuLinuxGuide\n\nA: This is a very old post, nevertheless still of interest. So I am wondering why nobody mentioned nomachine and the xnserver/xnclient. At work I used this for years to work remotely from a windows machine on a linux server. ...and I have the (important) impression, that it is free (not open source, though).\n", "Q: x61 Fingerprint Reader as a scanner? I've got an x61 tablet pc with fingerprint reader, and I want a way to see the image(?) scanned when I swipe my finger. Obviously I can use it for login - I don't really care about that, it's easier for me to type my password. I just want to be able to see the fingerprint it gets.\n\nA: The X61 series uses a UPEK Touchstrip fingerprint reader that, when using Linux drivers, does hardware image processing and then returns a status to the computer. Due to this design there is no way for you to access the scanned image.\nWith that said, there is evidence that with proprietary Windows drivers the device operates in a different mode that is capable of returning a scanned image, but it doesn't looks like there's been any development done in this area.\n", "Q: How do I get the wacom zoom wheel working?

When i was using windows, i used to run defrags, ccleaner and revouninstaller once a month to keep the system and the registry clean.\nI know ubuntu (and all linux distro) has a different system structure and doesnt need defrags, but i've heard there are some mainenance tasks that help to keep the system clean (for example, sudo apt-get clean or sudo apt-get autoremove)\nHow many of those commands/software (and please explain what they do and if they can compromise the system stability) do you know and use regularly?\n\nA: I recomend 2 gui-programs to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*bleach bit\n\n*ubuntu tweak.\n\n\nbleach-bit is the \"ccleaner\"-equivalent for linux, so you can figure what it can do:\nsudo apt-get install bleachbit from console to install.\nubuntu tweak is kinda a \"tweak-ui\"/software center/gconf/etc\nwhat we are interested here is the \"package cleaner\" option:\n\nTo install ubuntu-tweak:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nA: The purpose of the commands you mention is solely to save disk space. Furthermore, on most machines nowadays the savings would only amount to a tiny fraction of your disk space. So they're not very useful.\nMost common maintenance tasks are performed automatically by the system. If you're curious about them, the scripts that perform them are in /etc/cron.*. The name or contents of the script might give you a hint of what they do. Don't change anything you don't understand — these commands are there for a reason.\nOne maintenance task which is not done automatically is installing security and stability updates (major bug fixes). By default, you will get a notification that updates are available. You should follow on the notification at the first opportunity. This is not done automatically in case the updates arrive at an inconvenient time, like when you're on a pay-per-byte Internet access or you have to switch off your computer right now; also because there is a (very small) risk that the updates break something and it's better not to do it unattended.\nUpdates are the only maintenance task that I trigger manually. If I had to do anything else, I'd consider it a bug. If it has to be done, it should be automated.\n\nA: From the offical man page of apt-get (shortversion by me):\n   clean\n       clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files.\n       It removes everything but the lock file from\n       /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/. \n       This frees up disk space\n\n\n   autoremove\n       autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically\n       installed to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no\n       more needed.\n\nThere is also the gui computer-janitor (System => Administration => System Janitor)\n\nA: I am a software junkie - I keep trying out new software, installing it on my machine and then removing it. So for me apt-get -clean and apt-get -autoremove are used fairly regularly :-) \nI also recommend checking the update notifications and updating regularly. \nOne tool you might look at (I believe it is available in the administration section) is the computer janitor. It's great at identifying redundant packages which you can remove and free up space. \nOne other thing you might want to look at are redundant services - like  Apache, SSH, telnet, etc which may not be relevant or needed for a single desktop installation. If they are configured to run at start-up, you might be wasting performance/memory on unneeded services.\n", "Q: How to open a remote session? Earlier, I was trying to find a way to connect to Ubuntu from Windows 7: Is it possible to use remote desktop from Windows 7 to Ubuntu?\nThe solution was simple enough, I installed TightVNC Viewer on Win7 and I can see/control the current Ubuntu session.

Some applications treat it as one big 3840*1200 panel but that's pretty undesirable in first person shooters as your sights end up in the gap between the two screens.\nSo I usually run Wine games in a 1920*1200px window. The window manager makes it full-screen on one screen and that works great for some games. However some games lag and that allows the mouse to fly out the side of the Wine window, causing my player to spin like a fox on drugs.\nAnd then there are a whole load of native games (X3, OpenArena, Quake4, QuakeWars, etc) that don't have a good windowed mode. Using windowed mode on X3 results in the mouse becoming uber-sensitive.\nWouldn't it be nice if I could launch some games in a new X session that just used one screen?!\nIt would. I've got as far as this for Steam:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nX :3 -ac & nvidia-settings --load-config-only\nsleep 10 # wait for X to catch up\n\ncd ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/Steam/\nDISPLAY=:3 WINEDEBUG=-all wine \"Steam.exe\"\n\nNow this technically uses two screens but when games launch in fullscreen mode once they've already been set to 1920*1200, they seem to adapt and use one of my xorg.conf metamodes. It would be better if I could explicitly state the mode in this executable. Is there a way to do that?\nThere's also no sound. I've got the WinePulse patch so I just need to get PulseAudio hooked into this session (or vice versa) and I'm good to go for now, I think.\nEdit: Ralf picked up on a few things but missed (or misconstrued) some others.  This is probably down to my over-verbose question. Despite the length of the post, I only have two problems.\nHere are my problems in a succinct setting:\n\n*\n\n*How can I start a new X session with a specified resolution? I would preferably like to specify an existing metamode or the exact resolution when I call X.\n\n\n*How can I get applications on the new X session talking with the right PulseAudio server? At the moment, they don't seem to line up. I've tested this with totem, not just Wine apps.\n\nA: For sound, all you have to do is run ck-launch-session in the script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nX :3 -ac & nvidia-settings --load-config-only\nsleep 10 # wait for X to catch up\n\ncd ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/Steam/\nDISPLAY=:3 ck-launch-session\nDISPLAY=:3 WINEDEBUG=-all wine \"Steam.exe\"\n\nSound from both X displays get merged.\n\nA: Running more than one X session\nI think this is exactly what you want. And running more than X session is possible, that doesn't mean all video-drivers allow you to use the same video-card. So running more than Xsession, means you are going to need more than one video card.\nMetamodes \nGames can change the resolution of your desktop and the setup of your screen using meta-modes.\nSay you have a large 1680x1050 monitor on the left, and an older, smaller monitor on the right which has 1025x768 as the highest resolution.\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier  \"Default Screen\"\nDefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"1\"\n    Option         \"TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder\" \"CRT-0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"CRT-0: 1680x1050 +0+0, CRT-1: 1024x768 +1680 +0; CRT-0: 1680x1050 +0+0, CRT-1: NULL; CRT-0: 1400x900 +0+0, CRT-1: NULL;\"\nEndSection\n\nWhen you can select the resolution in a game you'll have these options:\n2704x1050      this refers to the total viewport size of using two monitors\n1680x1050      this means the second monitor is off, and you will use a high resolution\n1400x900       this also only used the first monitor, but it will run a bit quicker \n\nYou could add a lot of meta-modes. Just make sure that the 'resulting' viewport has a unique resolution. Otherwise the games won't understand it. \nInterestingly, when you alt-tab out of a game, your system will switch back to the original meta-mode, and when alt-tab back into a game, it will go to back to configured meta-mode for the game. \nWine/Steam\nThe meta-mode trick will work with wine as well. However, there are games that don't support changing the resolution. \nA nice workaround: \n- turn on emulate virtual desktop, in wine-config, and set it to your desktop size\n- compiz will automatically turn it into 'fullscreen' mode and hide panels\n- the mouse will be captured properly. Your other monitor is still on, and displays whatever is there. You will need to alt=tab to reach it though. Perhaps its a good idea to associate a shortcut to minimize window. \n\nIf you still have issue with mouse capturing with certain games, you can use mousewarp mode:\nWINEFORCEMOUSEWARP=yes wine yourapp.exe\n\nPulseaudio & Wine\nYou can use this PPA, to get a wine that has the pulse-audio driver enabled. Make sure to also select it using wine-config.\n https://launchpad.net/~neil-aldur/+archive/ppa\n\n\nA: To answer your question more specifically. You can use nvidia-settings to change the meta-mode. A fragment from nvidia-settings --help:\n-a, --assign=[ASSIGN]\n  The ASSIGN argument to the '--assign' commandline option is of the form:\n\n    {DISPLAY}/{attribute name}[{display devices}]={value}\n\n  This assigns the attribute {attribute name} to the value {value} on the X\n  Display {DISPLAY}.  {DISPLAY} follows the usual {host}:{display}.{screen}\n  syntax of the DISPLAY environment variable and is optional; when it is\n  not specified, then it is implied following the same rule as the\n  --ctrl-display option.  If the X screen is not specified, then the\n  assignment is made to all X screens.  Note that the '/' is only required\n  when {DISPLAY} is present.\n\n  {DISPLAY} can additionally include a target specification to direct an\n  assignment to something other than an X screen.  A target specification\n  is contained within brackets and consists of a target type name, a colon,\n  and the target id.  The target type name can be one of \"screen\", \"gpu\",\n  \"framelock\", \"vcs\", \"gvi\", or \"fan\"; the target id is the index into the\n  list of targets (for that target type).  The target specification can be\n  used in {DISPLAY} wherever an X screen can be used, following the syntax\n  {host}:{display}[{target_type}:{target_id}].  See the output of\n  `nvidia-settings -q all` for information on which target types can be\n  used with which attributes.  See the output of `nvidia-settings -q\n  screens -q gpus -q framelocks -q vcs -q gvis -q fans` for lists of\n  targets for each target type.\n\n  The [{display devices}] portion is also optional; if it is not specified,\n  then the attribute is assigned to all display devices.\n\n  Some examples:\n\n    -a FSAA=5\n    -a localhost:0.0/DigitalVibrance[CRT-0]=0\n    --assign=\"SyncToVBlank=1\"\n    -a [gpu:0]/DigitalVibrance[DFP-1]=63\n\n", "Q: Is there a significant disadvantage to aliasing rm to do something else? I've been bitten a few times recently with rming things I shouldn't have - for example, forgetting to ulink symlinks, not rm them.\nI'm thinking of writing a small bash script to simply move the target to ~/.local/share/Trash, as I haven't grasped restoring files (seems to involve a lot of Linux hackery that I'm not going to achieve any time soon).\nThe only problems I can think of are:\n\n\n*\n\n*scripts/applications needing to rm files (really a problem?

It works nicely with the gnome trash, you can recover files deleted from the command line with nautilus or the trash applet and restore files trashed from nautilus from the command line using trash-list.\nIt will take care of different files names and remember the original location of the files too.\n\nYou can also try gvfs-trash, as ændrük notes in the comments. But trash-put has a couple of advantages over gvfs-trash:\n1) It's not tied to gnome or gvfs. It will work even on a server without gnome or in other desktop environment. It achieves gnome compatibility because it uses the freedesktop trash spec, as gnome.\n2) It tries to use the same format as rm, so it can be aliased to it. It will not fail the first time that a script tries to trash-put -Rf dir\nThe main advantage of gvfs-trash is that it's installed by default in Ubuntu.\n\nA: The 'significant disadvantage' is that you'll get used to rm not being the big nasty, use with extreme care tool it is. This means if you ever (in your whole life, so pretty likely) use another computer not set up with this 'soft-rm' then you may use rm more carelessly, forgetting your safety net is not there.\n", "Q: What does the Ctrl-Alt-+ shortcut do? Simple question. I was about to assign the Ctrl+Alt++ keyboard shortcut to increase the volume, but I then realized it was already assigned for something. If I press this key combination the screen flashes black for a second, and then comes back. Pressing Ctrl+Alt+- produces similar behavior. So I'm curious, what's this shortcut supposed to do?\n\nA: Ctrl + Alt + F1 through F12 are mapped for switching between virtual consoles. Your graphical display is usually mapped to vt7 or vt8, so F7 or F8.\nCtrl + Alt + BkSp aborts your graphical server and kills all graphical processes.\nCtrl + Alt + - and + switch to a smaller or higher screen resolution, respectively.\nCtrl + Alt + Esc runs xkill by default. The next window you click is killed.\nThere are several others, but I can't recall them.\n\nIf you want to map +/- to something, I'd suggest using the Windows key as a modifier, if you have one. It's treated as a \"Super\" Meta-key, and doesn't normally have any mappings at all.\n", "Q: samba share not allowing username to be entered I have two samba shares.

Whenever I plug by digital camera in, a nice media-icon pops up. Great! !\nWhen I right click on this icon, I can only open Rhythmbox or VLC-media-player. Both applications are rather senseless to be used here. When I want to download photos (be it\nby means of F-Spot, Shotwell or Picasa) I have to unmount the camera first.

I just read that Broadcom has open-sourced their wireless adapter drivers and was curious if this would have any affect on my Dell XPS M1330 which sometimes has flaky wifi.\n\nA: lspci should have an entry for your wireless adapter, including the manufacturer.\n\nA: You can use lshw to show information on all devices in you system, forinstance what driver the device uses, this information will look something like this:\n*-network\n            description: Wireless interface\n            product: PRO/Wireless 2200BG [Calexico2] Network Connection\n            vendor: Intel Corporation\n            physical id: 2\n            bus info: pci@0000:0b:02.0\n            logical name: eth1\n            version: 05\n            serial: 01:22:ff:00:11:99\n            width: 32 bits\n            clock: 33MHz\n            capabilities: pm bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n            configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ipw2200 driverversion=1.2.2kmprq firmware=ABG:9.0.5.27 (Dec 12 2007) ip=192.168.2.100 latency=64 link=yes maxlatency=24 mingnt=3 multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11g\n            resources: irq:21 memory:b4001000-b4001fff\n\nIn the line starting with configuration: it says driver=ipw2200 which mens my wireless uses the ipw2200 kernel driver this can in turn point you to weather you will (in time) benefit from this release.

I'm about to (at least, want to..) buy a laptop with an ATI Radeon HD 4250, and I haven't a good opinion on ATI's drivers. How is the actual performance of the open/proprietary driver (currently I have nVidia, and I'm very satisfied)?\nThe intended use for the laptop is: watching videos, programming in Java/PHP/maybe Qt... but, I like to know if Compiz runs well. Yes, I'm a hardcore (?) programmer that uses Compiz. :P\nSomeone has this GPU? Experiences? Thoughts?\nThanks! :D\n\nA: Im using an Packard Bell easynote TJ75 with a ati mobility radeon HD5650, and its not bad at all.\nCompiz benchmark is around 500~600 frames/sec, i can play good World of Warcraft or Call of duty MW 4 (under wine), for example (well, there is some slowdown sometimes).\nBTW, im using the experimental drivers:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates/ubuntu lucid main \ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates/ubuntu lucid main\nhttp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x3B22AB97AF1CDFA9\n\nSometimes compiz has some issue (for example, does not load the windows icons, minimixe, maximize and close), but i dont know if this is really related with the ati card.\nI have an ati on my desktop too, with ubuntu 9.10 no kind of driver used to works, with ubuntu 10.04 it works perfectly.\nHere's a screenshot for you, with the compiz expo effect:\n\nAs you see, ati card and drivers does not work bad at all.\n\nA: Radeon 4200 here. The ATI proprietary drivers performance for me is acceptable, but the stability is not. They tend to lock up my laptop shortly after using any full-screen games or video, and they leak memory like a sieve. The \"-radeonhd\" open drivers work extremely well. They are fast and very stable. I have a very low-end laptop, so I can't vouch for playing games like COD:MW on it. Compiz runs extremely well though.\n\nA: According to Wikipedia's comparision of AMD chips you have a rv620 chip.\nThis chip is not supported by the opensource driver. See here for more info\nSo currently you are using VESA. Which is slow.\nSo for 2D support alone I would recommend installing the closed source fglrx driver.\nThat will also give you 3D support. Compiz will run fine, but there might be small issues with certain games on Wine. It's always hit or miss with any combination of driver, card, wine-version and game.\n\nA: This question is now more than two years old and the proprietary drivers have come to the point to being legacy for this particular hardware (Mobility Radeon 4200-series) on both Windows and Linux. The FGLRX-drivers did never work well with this graphics hardware and Unity suffered from poor performance with the FGLRX-driver. Even after disabling V-sync. I would strongly recommend to use open-source drivers, making use of the X-swat PPA if you want the latest stable open source drivers.\n", "Q: How do I renew my DHCP lease? Short of rebooting, how can I release and renew my DHCP lease? It would be useful to know a GUI and terminal method.\nI'd especially like to know if there is a means to do this without requiring admin privileges.\n\nA: Maverick comes with nmcli, a command line interface to the network manager. \nI can't see a simple way of telling it to renew a lease, but running:\nnmcli con\n\nGets you a connection list, and running:\nnmcli con down id 'Connection Name'\nnmcli con up id 'Connection Name'\n\nTakes the connection down and back up. It may be possible to do something similar with the device instead.\nThe connection list seems to include all connections, so this will probably work with PPTP and VPN connections too.\n\nA: To renew your dhcp lease at the terminal:\nsudo dhclient -r; sudo dhclient\n\n\nA: In my case I had to specify which card to renew:\nNote: you might want to join the two on one line, as otherwise you might lose the remote connection you're on after the first!\nFirst release the current IP address:\nsudo dhclient -r eth0\n\nthen renew the IP address\nsudo dhclient eth0\n\n.. or do them together to avoid losing connection:\nsudo dhclient -r eth0 && sudo dhclient eth0\n\n\nA: In the network drop-down selector of the system tray you can press the network you are already connected to. This will make NetworkManager ask for a new lease from a DHCP server.\n\nThis also works for wired networks, but I don't think it works for PPP connections (mobile broadband).\n\nA: If you're on a systemd based-version of Ubuntu without a GUI (i.e. server version) then this is the way to renew the DHCP lease:\nsudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd\n\nNote: If you're connected via the interface whose DHCP lease you're renewing you may get disconnected, unless you're connected via a statically configured interface or the console.\n\nA: This works on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nWhen I do that, Network Manager asks for a new DHCP lease.\nI prefer this to manually (re)starting dhclient because I've had problems by stale dhclient processes (ones not managed by Network Manager) spontaneously and incorrectly reconfiguring my network settings at random points when it's least convenient.\n\nA: Having just upgraded to Maverick Meerkat Beta 1, something broke in my standard, vanilla eth0 configuration which I've not debugged yet. The quick and dirty workaround has been\nsudo dhclient\n\nwhich notices that there was a (possibly dead) client already and obtains a new lease:\nThere is already a pid file /var/run/dhclient.pid with pid 2436\nkilled old client process, removed PID file\nInternet Systems Consortium DHCP Client V3.1.3\nListening on LPF/eth0/00:1a:92:24:9c:85\nSending on   LPF/eth0/00:1a:92:24:9c:85\nSending on   Socket/fallback\nDHCPDISCOVER on vboxnet0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3\nDHCPREQUEST of 192.168.2.2 on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67\nDHCPACK of 192.168.2.2 from 192.168.2.1\nbound to 192.168.2.2 -- renewal in 118389830 seconds.\n\nThis isn't a fix, just a hack. I'll follow-up when I figure what went bad.\n\nA: Lacking this specific capability via nmcli, I believe the best CLI solution is to release and kill the dhclient instance managed by NetworkManager, rather than starting a new one. NM will then bring it back up again automatically, avoiding having to restart the entire NM infrastructure.\nsudo dhclient -v -r -pf /run/sendsigs.omit.d/network-manager.dhclient-eth0.pid\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-v - make verbose\n\n*-r - release and shut down\n\n*-pf - pid file of NM's instance\n\n\nA: How you renew the DHCP lease depends on the DHCP client the system is using.\nSince 16.04, Ubuntu has used Netplan- a high-level abstraction- to set the networking gears in the renderer: directive in the config file /etc/netplan/fileName.yaml.\n\n*\n\n*Where renderer: NetworkManager, restart NetworkManager to renew the lease\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\n\n*Where renderer: networkd, then dhclient is used to renew the lease\nsudo dhclient -r; sudo dhclient\n\nAs a general rule at the time of this writing:\n\n*\n\n*Server versions of Ubuntu use systemd-networkd to control the networking in netplan\n\n\n*Desktop versions of Ubuntu use NetworkManager.\nObviously if you're a SysAdmin handling systems others have implemented, they could have changed the value of renderer to change the default, so worth checking the netplan config file to validate which system is authoritative.\n\nA: You can release dhcp or dhcpv6 by picking dhclient-xxxx.lease or dhclient6-xxxx.lease\nex.\nsudo dhclient -lf\n/var/lib/NetworkManager/dhclient-8c3bf569-fa6e-33d7-becb-a4095f8137c0-eth1.lease\n-r -v eth1\n\nsudo dhclient -6 -lf \n/var/lib/NetworkManager/dhclient6-6657588-f38e-45fd-b88d-6145401fae5e-eth1.lease\n-r -v eth1\n\n", "Q: Which bluetooth headphones work best?

The GRUB screen looks something like this (has a fedora logo at the bottom)\n\n\n*The problem is that when I insert the CD and try to boot, it takes me directly to the GRUB menu for Fedora/Vista, nothing for Ubuntu.\n\n*So, I tried Ubuntu's CD boot helper to help me boot from the CD, and I get this error\n\n\n*The BIOS says that I should press F2 for setup and F12 for boot options. I tried them. Nothing happens except that it goes straight to the GRUB menu.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: What you want is for your computer not to even get to GRUB. You want it to check for a CD in the drive before it goes to the hard disc (and loads GRUB).\nThis is done in a computer's 'BIOS'. Just after you turn the machine on, look for a screen, usually with the manufacturer's logo, but more importantly some text that gives you a button (normally something like F8 or F12 to change the boot order. Or alternatively to change the BIOS Settings or Startup settings. Here you want to 'move' the option to boot from CD above the option to boot from hard disc.\nIn your case, as you already have GRUB and a linux install, if these keyboard settings don't work, you can add an entry to GRUB to boot from CD by following this guide.\nThe Ubuntu wiki has an article describing some common problems when booting from CD.\n\nA: It was a stupid problem.\nMy machine has function keys that need to be pressed in combination of Fn key (opposite to what is there in most laptops). So, I was trying just that (Fn+F2, Fn+F12).\nTurns out while booting, you need to press F2 without the Fn key.\n\nA: Maybe you own an USB keyboard which gets activates too late.

I'm building a security-intensive (stores credit card numbers, etc) using Python and Django with UWSGI (written in C), NGINX, and PIL (Python Imaging Library). I'm trying to work my way up in the Ubuntu world to be less of an ignoramus, so I just bought the Official Ubuntu Server Book. Just reading this book isn't going to make me even an amateur level server admin compared to the peeps on here though, so I have to ask:\nWhich flavor of Ubuntu would be an optimal route to go down with the above requirements, and more importantly, why? I've read good things about Hardy, but I know not the reasons why it's \"good\".\n\nA: Hardy 8.04 and Lucid 10.04 are both Long-Term Support (LTS) releases and will be supported for quite a while.\nBoth are getting updates and security fixes until 2013 and 2015 respectively. Contrary to answer by Source Lab, LTS server editions are maintained for 5 years.\nHardy has python 2.5 as default whereas lucid has 2.6 as default. If not all of your dependencies are proven to be reliable with 2.6 I would recommend sticking with Hardy for now.\n\nA: Disclaimer: I deploy Django sites on \"current\" releases, not LTS. I'm sure I don't do everything perfectly but here's my opinion on the matter.\nThere's a lot of faith in LTS releases but the rules/benefits don't quite apply to Python stacks.\nI say this because keeping your python stack bound to a repository with its own updates can mean disaster when it comes to dist-upgrading. Versions jump so far that it's a lot harder to track down things have have been both deprecated and deleted from Django before you've seen the first deprecation notice. \nYou'll also get ferociously very fed up with the version of Django that comes with Lucid after a time. It won't support the production-ready features Django will have then so you'll want to install from outside the repositories.\nIt lets you keep multiple, fairly static virtual environment python stacks around. This means you can have a websites on old versions of things, other websites on other versions in another stack, test updates on new stacks, etc. It's a powerful concept but you need to keep on top of the versions as you don't have a package manager holding your hand for security updates.\nhttp://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2009/05/notes-using-pip-and-virtualenv-django/\nIf you're looking for the best of both worlds, use the latest versions. Before you upgrade to the next level, dump an image, copy to a local virtual machine, boot it up, upgrade packages, test your sites and fix anything that needs fixing. You have to spend some time keeping things stable at package level and you have to maintain your code occasionally...\n\nAs far as \"flavor\" goes, you want the server install, not desktop. ubuntu-desktop includes a whole load of flange you just don't want on a production server.\nYou can also get a \"minimal\" install which has barely anything on it. I've started from both but I had to install the ubuntu-standard package to be comfortable. This turns it into a basic ubuntu-server install.\n\nA: Install an LTS version of Ubuntu Server (current LTS is 10.04) and install it. That will give you a base on which you can install various server software, for example:\nsudo tasksel install mail-server\n\nto install a mail server ready-to-use stack\nYou can list all tasks using\nsudo tasksel --list-tasks\n\n\nA: Basically I would use the latest LTS release for a server, as of writing that would be 10.04 (Lucid Lynx). The reason is quite simple! On a server you properly want to use a system that doesn't need to be upgraded in a few months.\nThere is no reason to use Hardy Heron for a new server, it is currently two years old and will be abandoned in a year.\nUbuntu is released every six months and they are abandoned after eighteen months, except the LTS version that are released every other year and are kept alive for three years.\nEDIT: Server versions of LTS is kept alive for five years.\n", "Q: Automatically reconnect wireless connection The wireless connection in my house unfortunately often disappears, requiring a wireless router reboot.\nMaking this worse is that my ubuntu media pc, does not automatically reconnect to the wireless network when it's been gone, and then comes up about a minute later. The network in question is setup as \"connect automatically\" in the network settings.\nIf I manually select my wireless network, using the wireless icon in the topright of my screen, everything works fine, until the next time that wireless goes down.\nI'm looking for a way so I don't have to remember to do this manually all the time.\n\nA: This seems to be posted all over the net with no good solutions. I guess the best fix/workaround is to make it check for internet connectivity and if it is not there then reconnect. I did this via a ping test to google.com and then I simply made it restart networking.

But if my wife then logs on, I can't see either my account or my wife's.\nCan it be set up as a service, so it is enabled when I turn on the computer?\n\nA: Assuming you are talking about Ubuntu's built in VNC service, (when you say remote deskop I always think Windows RDP,) You need to look at your setting at   \nSystem -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop\nThere you should see all the settings you need.  This ofcourse just shares access to the computer so two users cannot log into two different accounts,  you can share mouse control or one can watch though.\nAlso this link may be of help:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC/Servers\n\nA: Dump vino. Its only job is to share the currently open session which means you can't do what you want.\nThere are a couple of alternatives to VNC but I'll start with another VNC solution first. TightVNC is another open source server that, with a bit of kicking, lets you pipe a whole new GDM screen through VNC, effectively allowing you to login as who you want.\nThe downside to this is you don't get to remote-control apps running on the real computer screen as when you login to this, you'll get a brand new desktop session. You might just want to control whoever's logged in so this wouldn't be for you.\nUnfortunately the only tutorial I've* been able to find is for Gentoo (another linux distribution).\n*And when I say \"I've\", I mean xiaclo on #ubuntu. I couldn't find any tutorials.\n\nIf you do just want to control whoever's logged in but hate having to configure VNC, I use x11vnc over ssh from my phone (it's a linux phone). Here's the one command I fire off:\nssh oli@192.168.0.4 -L 5900:localhost:5900 \"x11vnc\" | vncviewer\n\nThis tunnels the VNC server's connection back over the SSH to a local port so you connect from your client to localhost:5900. The  | vncviewer bit just opens the VNC client at the same time. That might be specific to my phone, so you might need to change that to whatever VNC viewer you use.\n\nNoMachine/FreeNX\nThere are other options perhaps better suited to the task. NoMachine/NX/FreeNX/etc are RDP-style servers that allow logins but they need a NX client. The benefit over VNC is it's really fast and quite low-bandwidth.\nThe Ubuntu help page should get you started but I'll warn you, it's not a short journey.\n", "Q: Readline not compiled by default - Causing `require': no such file to load -- readline When trying to install ruby 1.9.2 on Ubuntu 10.04 (64-bit), I get the following error after performing the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Dependencies\n\n*./configure to create make file\n\n*Make\n\n*Make Install\n\n*Make Clean\n\n*ruby -ropenssl -rzlib -rreadline -e \"puts :Hello\" (This should output 'hello' if all is well).,\n\n\nInstead of outputting hello, I get this:\nrequire: no such file to load -- readline`\nAfter searching online, I find this solution:\nBlockquote\n\nIf you’ve compiled Ruby from source, you might get this error when executing script/console:\n/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/irb/completion.rb:10:in `require': no such file to load -- readline (LoadError)\n  One way of fixing this is to compile readline, which is distributed along with the Ruby source:\ncd /opt/src/ruby-1.8.5-p2/ext/readline\nruby extconf.rb\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThis totally worked for me. My question is, why didn't ruby compile this to begin with? Did I forget some sort of config option?\n\nA: The reason Ruby didn't automatically include readline support was most likely because you didn't have libreadline, and its development files, installed on your system. When you run ./configure it does an inventory of your system, and uses that data to create an \"optimal\" Makefile.\nThe easiest way to get libreadline, and its development files, is to install the package libreadline-dev.\n\nA: Many (in fact, most) libraries and programming languages don't compile readline by default (PHP is another example). You need to configure that manually in the configure script or using this method.\nJust make sure you use the same option whenever you compile Ruby.\n", "Q: How to setup bluetooth tethering with iPhone?

Depending on the situation, I use either my speakers or my headset for audio output. Given that my headset is an USB headset it behaves as its own audio device.\nCurrently I switch between audio output devices by clicking on the speaker icon in the upper right tray, where I select Sound settings, goes to the Output tab and there choses the device I want.\nWhat I wonder is if there might be some easier/quicker way to switch back and forth to my USB headset? Perhaps a dedicated tray icon, a key mapping, or so?\nI am running Ubuntu 10.04, with the default Gnome desktop.\n\nA: Well, you can install pavucontrol, it shows apps with sound device selection on the first tab, it'll save you some effort. But what you really want I think is to mark you USB headset as default device, then every time you plug it in all sound will be redirected to it, and when you plug it out - it'll be back to speakers. Effortless, really.\n\nA: Of course switching devices by using the Applet is also working fine. But the cool thing about writing a script, is that it is super fast. I put mine for example on the keyboard shortcut alt+s. thus when I want to switch from headphones to speakers, I only need to press alt+s.\nAnyway. Andrew said: \n\nIf you have more than two audio devices and want to swap to a\n  different one, you'll need to replace the logic on line 7 with some\n  conditionals.\n\nThat's what I did. I share it, in case someone has troubles with it:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n#sinks=($(pacmd list-sinks | grep index | \\\n#    awk '{ if ($1 == \"*\") print \"1\",$3; else print \"0\",$2 }'))\nsinks=($(pacmd list-sinks | grep index | \\\n    awk '{ if ($1 == \"*\") print \"1\"; else print \"0\" }'))\ninputs=($(pacmd list-sink-inputs | grep index | awk '{print $2}'))\n\n#find active sink\nactive=0\nfor i in ${sinks[*]}\ndo\n    if [ $i -eq 0 ]\n        then active=$((active+1))\n        else break\n    fi\ndone\n\n#switch to next sink\nswap=$(((active+1)%${#sinks[@]}))\n\npacmd set-default-sink $swap &> /dev/null\nfor i in ${inputs[*]}; do pacmd move-sink-input $i $swap &> /dev/null; done\n\nWhat I did differently is a) find the active sink in a for loop. And b) switch to the next sink by increase the index by 1. Then I modulo the result by the number of sinks. That assures that e.g. when having 3 sinks, (2+1)%3=0. Thus from sink index 2 we would switch to sink index 0.\nIn this way the switch allows to move upwards through the available sinks. \n\nA: The question is quite old but my answer may still be useful for GNOME 2 users. I used PulseAudio Mixer Applet for the exact problem described here. You can change input and output devices right in the panel menu. It's the most convenient way I found.\n\nA: To cycle through your list of sound devices, use the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndeclare -i sinks=(`pacmd list-sinks | sed -n -e 's/\\**[[:space:]]index:[[:space:]]\\([[:digit:]]\\)/\\1/p'`)\ndeclare -i sinks_count=${#sinks[*]}\ndeclare -i active_sink_index=`pacmd list-sinks | sed -n -e 's/\\*[[:space:]]index:[[:space:]]\\([[:digit:]]\\)/\\1/p'`\ndeclare -i next_sink_index=${sinks[0]}\n\n#find the next sink (not always the next index number)\ndeclare -i ord=0\nwhile [ $ord -lt $sinks_count ];\ndo\necho ${sinks[$ord]}\nif [ ${sinks[$ord]} -gt $active_sink_index ] ; then\n    next_sink_index=${sinks[$ord]}\n    break\nfi\nlet ord++\ndone\n\n#change the default sink\npacmd \"set-default-sink ${next_sink_index}\"\n\n#move all inputs to the new sink\nfor app in $(pacmd list-sink-inputs | sed -n -e 's/index:[[:space:]]\\([[:digit:]]\\)/\\1/p');\ndo\npacmd \"move-sink-input $app $next_sink_index\"\ndone\n\n#display notification\ndeclare -i ndx=0\npacmd list-sinks | sed -n -e 's/device.description[[:space:]]=[[:space:]]\"\\(.*\\)\"/\\1/p' | while read line;\ndo\nif [ $(( $ord % $sinks_count )) -eq $ndx ] ; then\n    notify-send -i notification-audio-volume-high --hint=string:x-canonical-private-    synchronous: \"Sound output switched to\" \"$line\"\n    exit\nfi\nlet ndx++\ndone;\n\nAll credit goes to tsvetan from the Ubuntu forum.\n\nA: Thanks for the scripts! I added a part for input (microphone) as well in case anyone wants to use it:\nwhile read line ; do\n  case $line in \n    *\\*\\ index*) x=1 ;;\n    index*) x=0 ;;\n    name*) \n      source=$(echo $line | sed -e \"s/.*<//;s/>.*//\")\n      if [[ $x = \"0\" ]] ; then\n        pacmd set-default-source $source &> /dev/null\n      fi ;;\n  esac\ndone < <(pacmd list-sources | grep -e alsa_input -e index)\n\n\nA: In order to change the default audio output device from the command line, you can use the pacmd Pulse Audio command-line utility.\nI found the need to do similarly today, wanting to switch between headphones and speakers, both plugged into separate audio cards. Here's the shell script I wrote to do so:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nsinks=($(pacmd list-sinks | grep index | \\\n    awk '{ if ($1 == \"*\") print \"1\",$3; else print \"0\",$2 }'))\ninputs=($(pacmd list-sink-inputs | grep index | awk '{print $2}'))\n\n[[ ${sinks[0]} = 0 ]] && swap=${sinks[1]} || swap=${sinks[3]}\n\npacmd set-default-sink $swap &> /dev/null\nfor i in ${inputs[*]}; do pacmd move-sink-input $i $swap &> /dev/null; done\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*This swaps between the first two audio output devices that the pacmd utility lists. If you have more than two audio devices and want to swap to a different one, you'll need to replace the logic on line 7 with some conditionals.\n\n*Just swapping the default sink device does not do anything for the applications currently running — they will continue to output to the previous device. This script also moves the sink destination for all existing inputs. I.e., if you run this script with music playing on one device, it will instantly swap to the other. If you'd like the existing applications to continue on the previous device, comment out the last line (and line 5, if you'd like).\n\n\nA: I was looking for a way to do this to switch between the internal speakers on my laptop and an apple airport base station which is plugged into my stereo. I decided to assign hotkeys to switch. I wanted the audio preferences window to pop up for a second to give a visual confirmation of the switch and used wmctrl to close the window afterwards. \n(I used ctrl+F8 and ctrl+F9 as the hotkeys since the Fn function of these keys on my laptop is to increase and decrease the volume so it seemed obvious to have the ctrl functions change the audio output.)\nI used the following 2 (almost identical) scripts:\n#! /bin/bash\ngnome-volume-control -p output &\nsleep .7 \npacmd set-default-sink 1\nsleep .8 \nwmctrl -c \"Sound Preferences\"\nexit\n\n#! /bin/bash\ngnome-volume-control -p output &\nsleep .7 \npacmd set-default-sink 0\nsleep .8 \nwmctrl -c \"Sound Preferences\"\nexit\n\nThe first changes to the apple base station (which I assigned to ctrl+F9) and the second one switches back to internal speakers (ctrl+F8). This assumes that these are the only 2 output devices installed.\n\nA: I built upon Andrews script to make it use notify-osd to announce what it just did. Edit the lines with the names after your needs.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nsinks=($(pacmd list-sinks | grep index | \\\n    awk '{ if ($1 == \"*\") print \"1\",$3; else print \"0\",$2 }'))\ninputs=($(pacmd list-sink-inputs | grep index | awk '{print $2}'))\n\n[[ ${sinks[0]} = 0 ]] && swap=${sinks[1]} || swap=${sinks[3]}\n\npacmd set-default-sink $swap \n\nfor i in ${inputs[*]}; do pacmd move-sink-input $i $swap &> /dev/null; done\n\nif [ \"$swap\" = \"0\" ]; then\nnotify-send -u normal -i audio-volume-medium-symbolic \"Sound output changed.

I recently solved my problem How to check if Network Proxy is really applied? \nNow I can use sudo apt-get install application-name easily - but the problem is that the normal user (not the superuser) cannot see the proxy.\nFor example, these commands have different outputs:\nwget http://whatismyip.com\nand\nsudo wget http://whatismyip.com\nIt shows that the first command does not use the proxy while the second clearly says:\n\nConnecting to localhost|127.0.0.1|:8080... connected.\n\nthe strange thing is that when I check http://whatismyip.com with Firefox, it shows the proxy IP not my real IP, which means that Firefox sees the proxy.\nWhy can't wget see the proxy?\n\nA: Did you check that after doing Apply System-wide... that the following things happen :\n\n\n*\n\n*the file /etc/environment has entries with the proxy settings you specified.\n\n*Any terminal program launched after closing the Network proxy dialog has the proxy variables set in their environment ?\nset | grep -i proxy\n\nshould give you entries like this\nhttps_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/\nhttp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/\nftp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/\n\nwget as per the manual would use these proxies.

Deleting many images can be extremely slow, as it tries to update the result count at every delete.\n\nAll three of these tools find visual duplicates, not just files that are identical byte for byte.\n\nA: fdupes\nYou can use a command line tool called fdupes to find duplicate files (see man fdupes for more details). I don't know of any way to find 'duplicates' that have been resized. A program that did this would require some sort of intelligent algorithm that analyzed the image contents, because when an image is resized its data is changed, so traditional duplicate finding methods would not work.\nTo install fdupes in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install fdupes\n\n\nA: dupeGuru Picture Edition works absolutely great, and is worth trying.\nThey have a Launchpad PPA, dupeguru (new all-in-one package) or dupeguru-pe (old picture edition package) can be installed from it using those commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hsoft/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install dupeguru\n\n\nA: imgSeek \nimgSeek can find duplicates as well as similar pictures (so it should be able to find resized photos and photos with different filenames and metadata) and even search photos based on a sketch. It is available in desktop and server versions.\nI haven't actually tried it myself, though.\n\nA: FSlint \nfslint is a graphical program that can find duplicate files of any type by md5sum. If the images are not identical, they won't be flagged as duplicates. The image below shows a bunch of duplicate pdf files in my Downloads directory:\n\nYou can change the advanced search parameters to search by file type and restrict yourself to images only. That's done through changing the \"extra find parameters\" as find command options. For example, here I am only looking for *.jpg files (in the same path, only looking at my \"Downloads\" folder:\n\nfdupes \nfdupes is an equivalent command-line based tool. Both are available in the repos.\n\nA: Visipics\nVisipics is a free Windows application for that function, but works just fine on Linux, via wine, of course (It's better than geeqie/gqview regarding the sorting of the duplicates (geeqie's results are absolutely \"un-sortable\")).\nYou can tell it to auto-select the images based on criteria such as smaller file size, non-compressed type, lower resolution (it won't do the opposite though, you'd need to do it manually, which wouldn't be much better than doing it on geeqie, except that the selection doesn't require holding Shift/Ctrl), and even prioritize folders (but the last priority is folder priority).\nYou must pay attention to symbolic links, though -- it can \"randomly\" select to save a symbolic link to a file while deleting the actual file as a \"copy\". That's a shame.\n\nA: I've written this Python script to find visually similar images, and delete all but the largest one.\nIt uses findimagedupes internally, to find the duplicate images.\nIt can be invoked with the -d and -r options for your use-case which would:\n\n*\n\n*Not delete (the lower-sized visually-similar) files.\n\n*Output a \"dups.txt\" file which would contain the duplicate (visually-similar to be precise) files.\n\nhttps://github.com/AnirudhKishan/DeleteVisuallyRedundant\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu sometimes ugly when I log in? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDesktop forgets theme? \n\nSometimes, maybe once every week or two, things look like this when I log in:\n\nWhen this happens, I log out and then back in and things look normal again:\n\nThis happens in Ubuntu 10.04 on my ThinkPad X60 and my custom built desktop. It has only ever happened on the first log in after booting the computer.\nWhat could cause something so intermittent?\n\nA: It's possible that gnome-settings-daemon (which controls theming) crashes or fails to start on login. If you want to confirm this as the case, you can enable crash reporting and see if it crashes when you notice it. From there, you can send in your crash report so it will hopefully be fixed.\nTo do this, open /etc/default/apport and change \"enabled=0\" to \"enabled=1\". You'll want to open this file as root; in a terminal type sudo nano /etc/default/apport to accomplish this. Change the value, hit Ctrl-X to quit, and press Y to save. Reboot, and crash reporting will be running and you'll be able to send in the problem when it happens.\n", "Q: How to configure domain name on school network I'm trying to set up my server (running Ubuntu server 8.04) on my university network so that I can access it from anywhere on campus. Last year I had it plugged into my router and set my router's domain like network.myschool.edu and hostname to dlh. This allowed me to access the router using dlh.network.myschool.edu, and I just used port-forwarding to access the server.\nNow I'm just plugging the server in sans router and I'm trying to emulate the same setup. I have Avahi installed and I've tried setting my /etc/hostname to both dlh and dlh.network.myschool.edu. It doesn't seem to be working though when I try to ping from another computer.\nHonestly though, I don't understand the whole domain/hostname thing very well and I'm not sure how this is done properly.\n\nA: The school will have a fully resolved domain name of the nature “school.edu” and machines on that network will be resolved by the school DNS Server to be “server.school.edu”. This DNS Server will also, probably in cooperation with a DCHP server, allocate the machine an IP address.\nFor your machine to take part in this the school IT support department needs to make changes to there servers. If they cooperate and depending upon the setup they use your machine might become available on the local network and possibly on the internet with a fully resolved name.\nAlternately, as you already had the machine set up at home you could leave it there and access it via the internet.\nOr again, if you are willing to work with IP addresses you might get away with a standard DCHP configured machine on the local network and simply connect to the IP address.\nUse ifconfig on the server to find its IP address then from another machine try pinging that address or connecting to a service on that machine. \n\nA: I would contact the network administrator of your school. Maybe they have changed some setup to provide additional security.\n", "Q: Stuck in logon loop Here's the deal. I set up a computer with Ubuntu 10.04 for my grandmother. Everything worked fine. I connected it to the internet at her house today. After rebooting the computer I found that the computer would kick you back to the logon screen if you attempted to logon to her account. It worked fine logging on to my admin account, and also in Gnome's safe mode. I thought it had resolved itself, but turns out it hadn't, and now I don't have physical access to the computer, plus the remote connection I'd hoped to use only works intermittently.\nI need some suggestions for troubleshooting for when I'm at her house at some point next week. Ask for any more details, but I'm afraid I won't be able to provide many more until I've checked it out in person, since she is basically unable to use a computer beyond web browsing.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Ideas for debugging:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any odd applications in session startup (~/.config/autostart) that may be causing a logout by killing gnome-session prematurely?\n\n*Check ~/.xsession-errors on the account after it fails to sign in. There should be details of what's going awry.\n\n*If not, check /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see if X itself is crashing. This is unlikely, as you mentioned that other accounts could sign in fine.\n\n\nIn the meantime, if any of these suggestions don't root up any problems, I'd create her a clean temporary account to use until you're able to resolve the issue.\nEdit: This is assuming you have SSH access; it may be a little difficult to relay these instructions over the phone.\n\nA: The solution for me was to delete ~/.gconf.

In my case I would click on the login name and then it would just loop back to the screen.\nI tried deleting the ~/.gconf with no luck, or at least doing that alone wasn't enough. To do this, I switched to the terminal from the login screen Ctrl+Alt+F2\nrmdir ~/.gconf\n\nThe solution seemed to be a forced reinstall of gnome-session, which clearly I must have broke while playing with user or login settings or when I was uninstalling packages I didn't want (Evolution, UbuntuOne).\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session\n\nAnd then rebooted with,\nreboot now\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and it was due to an xserver upgrade which stoped recognizing my nvidia drivers, which I had installed manually.

I would like to turn this 32GB USB 2.0 flash drive into a 32 GB partition with Ubuntu installed on it which I can boot and read/write persist as any normal hard drive install would be expected to do. The trick is that I don't want to have to install Ubuntu to create this thing. Can I create it from a live boot of a CD? If so, I'll take the challenge to the next level by saying I'd like to avoid that as well. There has to be a way to create it from Windows to USB right? (I have ISO of 10.4)\n\nA: UNetbootin is what you want. Runs on Windows and Linux and creates bootable flash drives from ISO images, 10.04 included. However, the default setup does not use persistent space, so changes made will be lost on shutdown. An appropriate way to work around this is to follow these instructions.\nI believe you may be able to add persistent to the boot options alone, but I haven't tested this and the other method is what seems to work for most.\n\nA: +1 to PenDriveLinux. They've been working on this for a while, they have half a dozen solutions. I've personally used one or two from a windows install (within a Ubuntu-hosted Virtual machine!) and works great.\n\nA: Following creates persistence partitions of any size:\nBoot Live CD.\nPlug in flash drive.\nStart Partition Editor\nCreate 1GB+ FAT32 partition, (on the left side of the bar).

After installing and restarting your session (or just nautilus) you'll be able to right-click on any file/folder and select \"Open as administrator\" and be prompted for your password. Works well for opening root nautilus windows, root archive managers, root text editors... you get the idea.\n\nA: I've added a Nautilus script that allows me to - from nautilus - open the current folder as root. That way, I could open the current folder as root, right-click and extract the archive using Archive manager and then move the files to /usr/local.

I resized the partition and then installed ubuntu on the free space. Now my windows doesn't load\nI have tried mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows \ntried changing fstab tried changing grub.cfg\nI also installed ntfs config tool but it doesn't detect the windows partition\nbut sudo fdisk -l show me the windows partition on /dev/sda1 with ntfs\n\nIf I can't mount the windows partition now, can you tell me how do I dual boot? When I switch on my laptop, it directly boots into Ubuntu without any grub menu. How do I fix this issue to show a grub menu and dual boot into both windows & ubuntu?\n\nA: Like the responses in SU mentioned the encrypted partition onto which windows was installed is not really a ntfs partition - it contains data in a format only safeboot can understand. Now to have dual boot in such a system would have needed you to resize the partition before Safeboot encryption was setup.\nThere is one way to reach the situation you want (dual boot with Windows on a safeboot encrypted partition and ubuntu on another), if the following prerequisites are met:\n\n*\n\n*You are willing to backup all the data and reinstall ubuntu\n\n*You are willing to backup all the data and reinstall windows and windows apps\n\n*You are willing to setup the encryption again.\n\n*You have some kind of windows or safeboot rescue cd (see this)\n\nEven with all these, the method I can think of has some caveats. Read along. These are the steps:\n\n*\n\n*backup all data in ubuntu partition. To make restoration easier you could note the list of packages already installed by running the following command and backing up the resulting selections.txt file\n sudo aptitude --get-selections > ~/selections.txt\n\n\n\n*Boot into ubuntu livecd / liveusb and delete the ubuntu partition.\n\n\n*From within the same live user session, resize the ntfs partition to its original size (the size it was before you started to install ubuntu).\n\n\n*reboot with the safeboot+windows resuce cd and repair the system.\nIdeally this should detect a damaged boot record and should restore the possibility to boot back into windows within the encrypted partition.\nCaution\nI am totally not aware of safeboot and never used it and don't know if there is a rescue cd or if it can do step 4. The step 4 is only a helpful suggestion based on a few minutes of googling. Take support of your IT or of mcaffee if possible.\nWith the above you should have your system back at the same state before you started installing ubuntu.\nNow you need to resize your ntfs partition - this is not possible by fdisk, gparted or the ubuntu installer if the partition is encrypted. So, if it is possible, turn off encryption temporarily and decrypt the entire partition in place temporarily, then resize it and turn back encryption on. Again I am a total illiterate novice w.r.t safeboot trying to help with an abstract conceptual suggestion the practical application of which you need to figure out. If switching back to non-encrypted mode temporarily is not possible (due to tool constraints or lack of space) then u need to back up all data and settings and application information and re-install windows and apps again after re-partitioning the disk (because, repartitioning will mean a reformat of entire disk in this case).\nIf you get this far, putting back ubuntu on the remaining space available should be trivial.

I know Ubuntu comes with a \"Remote Desktop\" option that appears to be a straightforward VNC server, and I'm trying to understand the alternatives. Here are the possibilities I've heard about so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*VNC \n\n*VNC + SSH Tunnelling\n\n*NX Server, free edition\n\n*FreeNX\n\n*NeatX\n\n*X2Go\n\n*X11 Forwarding over SSH\n\n*xrdp \n\n\nI'm coming at this from a Windows user's perspective: To the best of my experience, RDP (aka Terminal Services) is a reasonably secure (barring mitm/server spoofing), efficient desktop sharing protocol with well-supported clients, that can be exposed to the internet when necessary without major fears of intrusion. To the best of my knowledge straight VNC is none of those things, which is where I get confused - why wouldn't a better desktop sharing technology be developed or used in the open-source world? I know VNC can be wrapped with SSH, but that seems beyond the reach of a casual user. X11 forwarding over SSH may be more or less efficient, I have no idea, but is definitely even more complicated, and doesn't (as far as I know) give you access to already-running stuff (no desktop sharing as such, just remote application running).\nSo, I'd like any feedback/preferences amongst these or any other \"Free\" desktop sharing options, using these criteria and/or any others:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security (esp. for access across internet)\n\n*Efficiency (bandwidth usage, responsiveness, etc)\n\n*Free-ness, as in Speech (not sure where RDP or FreeNX lie for this)\n\n*Free-ness, as in Beer (are there any commercial solutions with usable dependable free offerings?)\n\n*Ease of use (server and client side)\n\n*Cross-OS Client availability\n\n*Cross-OS Server availability\n\n*Support for independent sessions and shared (and/or \"Console\") sessions\n\n*Ongoing support/maintenance/development\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: I stumbled upon this while researching xrdp, which is the only one you mentioned that I haven't used. Some observations:\nNX Server: not so speedy (v3, still awaiting v4), might pose performance issues depending on your environment. The Qt-based client software is clunky but better than any open source implementations. Can't share a user's session remotely.\nFreeNX: similar to NX Server, not the fastest, no opensource client software worth mentioning. I used this for 16+ months. Can't share a user's session remotely.\nneatx: has some showstopper bugs, eg. the session disconnect bug that won't let you login again using the same login credentials if your session fails (clear temp files using another login, then it works until your next failure). This is a 1+ year old bug IIRC. I used this for 10+ months. Can't share a user's session remotely.\nVNC: ultra slow, no inbuilt security, however the client software options are pretty good for *nix/Windows platforms. No good VNC server for OSX yet. Unique selling point: CAN see a user's screen. Sufficient for remote desktop support but nothing else. Used this at a Windows \"managed services\" shop for the past few years, mostly K-VNC (enterprise) and UltraVNC servers.\nx2go: fast, polished, the best so far. Supports remote audio, printing, clipboard etc. Can't share a user's session remotely.\nI'm about to give xrdp a shot because I dislike installing more stuff on fragile Windows systems, and I always end up working on the darned things.\nCheers.\n\nA: I'm using right now FreeNx in production, and in the past our company has been a NoMachine customer. We use FreeNX on the server and the proprietary but free NoMachine client on the desktops (both Ubuntu and Windows).\nThe relationship isn't complex, NoMachine had a proprietary product (free as in beer up to 3 users) but releases the back-end stuff as open source. FreeNx is build with this back-end and is always somewhat less polished, and a couple of versions behind the NoMachine server. NoMachine has announced on December 21th 2010 that the next version it's NX technology (NxServer 4) will be close source only.\nx2go was another company that build a open source product based on NoMachine open source libs.\nFinally, Google has released NeatX, a complete independent implementation of the NX protocol. It's far from complete but usable, and totally open source.\nSo, recap you needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security: They all are SSH connections. Tick.\n\n*Efficiency: Right now I'm tunnelling Windows RDP sessions in NX and having better speeds than naked RDP. Tick.\n\n*Free-ness as in speech. FreeNX, NeatNX, tick. NxServer. Fail.\n\n*Free-ness as in beer: NxServer up to 3 users\n\n*Ease of use: NxServer is very easy to setup and administer. Others are worse on the server side. FreeNx is on the official repos.\n\n*Cross-OS client: I haven't found a decent Andriod client. Great clients for all main desktop OSes and a java-based one that can be embeded on a web.\n\n*Cross-Os server: Nope. NxServer can tunnel RDP sessions, but doesn't work on windows.\n\n*Independent and shared sessions: Tick.\n\n\nA: I'm very fond of X2Go.

I put in my laptop login and password...message now is: hylton@hylton:~$\nWhere do I go from here?\n\nA: There are several things you can do. There is no need to immediately jump into a reinstall. You can (now that you're in the command prompt) delete the various directories which are full of photos and other un-needed files. To do so you'll need to navigate to those directories and run the delete command.\nThis falls under the classification of \"Basic Bash\" but you'll mainly be using cd, ls, and rm. For the example we'll assume you've placed the Photographic content in your \"Pictures\" directory.\ncd ~/Pictures\nls\nrm *.jpg\n\nThat will go into the Pictures directory, show a list of all the files, then it will delete all jpg files - the last part of the command will very depending on your file formats. If you wanted to delete all files in that directory just use an * if you wanted to delete all files and sub-folders you'll need to use rm -r * Be very careful when using the rm command it's permanent\nIf you are feeling a little more impatient you can just remove the entire Pictures directory like so:\ncd ~\nrm -rf Pictures\n\nAt any time you can check the diskspace you have available on your machine by typing df -h which will print out relevant diskspace information. Once you've cleaned space off you can run several other commands to help clear up diskspace:\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nWhich will clear your package cache and free up additional diskspace.\nIssue a restart of your computer and everything should come back up. If not you'll likely have some corrupt configurations on your machine and need to reinstall packages.\n\nA: that is your home directory.i.e. /home/hylton Now.

It's extremely difficult to debug due to the fact that it only happens every once in a while.\n\nA: Whenever I trip on this panel visual corruption, I do a right click on the panel bar, select \"Preferences\" or \"Properties\" (sorry, my language is Italian, I am not sure which is the correct menu option equivalent to \"Proprieta\") and just increase the height of the panel by a couple of pixels, WITHOUT CLOSING THE WINDOW.\nGnome repaints the higher panel bar almost on the fly, correcting whatever defect there was, and as soon as it has done so, I revert the pixel height back to the previous value and close the panel \"Properties\"/\"Preferences\" window.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but I resolved this issue using a script I found in http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/how-to-restore-default-gnome-panels-in-ubuntu/ I normally don't use script's and such, but this one came from a site that I trust.\n\nA: I workaround this by adding the command killall gnome-panel to System->Preferences->Startup Applications\n\nA: Run alt+f2 gnome-panel --replace to fix the problem.

It takes me about 5 tries to resize a window on my computer.\nIs there a way to increase the resize margin on the edge of windows?\n\nA: The thickness of the window border is set by the theme you are using.\nSo to make the window edges bigger try a different theme.\n\nA: It looks like this will be fixed in Natty.\n\nA: (This is from my answer to a duplicate question that was closed. )\nIt depends on the theme used. You could change your theme, or edit the theme if you really wanted to, but an easier and more consistent way is to hold down Alt and drag with the middle mouse button. You can imagine it as slicing the window into a 3x3 grid, and clicking in any rectangle but the center one will allow you to drag the appropriate side or corner.\nNote that Alt + MiddleButton is the default configuration. To change it (at least in Compiz):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System -> Preferences -> CompizConfig Settings Manager if running classic Gnome, or search for CompizConfig Settings Manager in the Dash if running Unity.\n\n*Find the Resize Window plugin; it's under Window Management.\n\n*Open it and go to the Bindings tab if you aren't already there.\n\n\nThe last two settings are called Initiate Window Resize. One of them is the middle click option described above; the other is a similar keyboard binding that allows you to resize with the keyboard arrow keys (as well as the mouse without clicking).\n\nA: To modify Ambiance to have a wider margin, open /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml and increase the values of the following properties:\n<distance name=\"left_width\" value=\"1\"/>\n<distance name=\"right_width\" value=\"1\"/>\n<distance name=\"bottom_height\" value=\"1\"/>\n\nYou may want to back up the original file before modifying, and/or make a duplicate of the entire theme.\nNote that you can also resize windows by pressing Alt + Button2. \n\nA: There is also a default keyboard short-cut in gnome -- Alt-F8 -- that is a 'resize window' function.\n\nA: Right click on the title bar and select Resize from the popup menu.\n\nA: The GNOME desktop environment is designed to give priority to usability and simplicity over customizability. Hence, the width of the window border is something that is not easily changeable. In all practical considerations, Jacob's recommendation that you use Alt+middle-click instead of dragging the window borders is likely to be the best solution for most users.\nWith that said, the size of the window border does vary between Metacity themes. As a first step, you might try picking a different theme from GNOME-Look.org.\nIf you're really determined to adjust just the window border without changing the rest of the theme, it is possible to modify existing themes. Here's a reference to get you started.\n\nA: As others have mentioned, it depends on the theme. Try a few out. What I frequently do instead is hold down Alt and middle-click (right-click in some environments) and drag to resize, which works anywhere on the window.\nNote that many themes that seem to have a 1px border (or no border at all) actually do tend to have a generous invisible border just outside the window. You usually don't have to pinpoint a tiny window border to resize.\n\nA: Current Solution (2019) for Ubuntu-MATE 16.x, 18.x**\n(possibly more, pls add to comments)\nYes, those borders are a pain, bordering on –pun intended– masochism...\n\n1 create copy of a theme\nWell, ClearLooks is (for some reason) not really a \"full theme\" to pick on the Theme tab, but rather a \"Border Theme\" under „customize..“ on the Window Border Tab:\n\nWell, never mind, let's create a copy (use rsync or cp as you please):\n(If you are fond of another \"border theme\" then duplicate that one accordingly.

So I went for a different approach and disabled the overlays all together!  Scroll still works, of course, and the nice orange scroll indicator is still present.  On Ubuntu 13.04, I did it like this:\ngsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode 'overlay-touch'\n\nYou can revert it by doing:\ngsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode 'overlay-auto'\n\n\nA: OK, to maximize the window the keyboard shortcut is ctrl+super+ up(on the keyboard) to minimize it is ctrl+super+down. To resize it is alt+ F8\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but IMO none of the answers really solved this particular question, they just added workarounds.\nThe actual answer to this is what's described in this GitHub issue's comment, which is to manually edit a setting that isn't exposed in the GUI. (No, the Settings > Windows > Behavior > Window drag/resize threshold (Pixels) entry doesn't fix this, contrary to what 99% of users would think.)\nTL;DR The \"real\" solution to this is:\ndconf write /org/cinnamon/muffin/draggable-border-width 20\n\nwhere 20 represents \"20 px\". The default is 10 px. Note that cinnamon and/or muffin would be replaced with whichever environment you're using. Should be somewhat easy to decipher which pertains to your system since all the other Settings > Windows fields would be listed inside it (i.e. running dconf list /org/env/windowsSettings/ would show the other Windows settings' fields).\n", "Q: Which Time Tracker application do you recommend? I have to do three or four jobs a day, and each has several parts. I want a time tracker tool to help me know how much time I've spent on each part and each job overall. \nI've found some like gnotime and hamster.\nWhat application do you recommend for such a case?\n\nA: Hamster\nHamster helps you to keep track of how much time you spend on various\nactivities during the day. Whenever you move from one task to another, you can change your current activity, or you can record time spent afterwards.\nMain app: hamster-time-tracker (Ubuntu 20.04 and later) hamster-applet (Ubuntu 18.04 and earlier)\nTo install hamster-time-tracker in Ubuntu 20.04 and later open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install hamster-time-tracker\n\nAppindicator: hamster-indicator\nTo install hamster-indicator in Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install hamster-indicator\n\nI've grown fond of Hamster, and used it for tracking how long I worked on a Summer of Code project. It's added to your indicator menus (or systray). When you want to start/stop/change tasks, just hit Super+H and type what you are doing.\nIt makes some pretty nice statistics for you that can be exported as HTML, for sending to others. You can categorize parts of a job into groups to keep track of what exactly you're doing at the time.\nEach task is labelled as [task]@[job]. For example, you could have dev@project, doc@project, etc. Hamster will do some auto-completion on these as well so most of the time you only need to type a few characters. Tags can be added to tasks as well for further categorization.\n\n\nScreenshot by Toms Bauģis\n\nA: I'm surprised ActivityWatch isn't mentioned in any of these threads. Found it after a lot of searching online.\nRepository link with install instructions\nIt has exactly the features that I needed:\n\n\n*completely local data (no account signup needed)\n\n*application level time tracking (also website level time tracking if you install the browser extension)\n\n*idle time detection\n\n*categorization of applications into work/fun/etc.\n\n*tracks activity from the background, instead of me having to consciously log tasks/events\n\nWould have probably bought it even if it was paid, but best part, it's completely open source! Plus, it's under active development, unlike other 2010 apps in this thread which are unmaintained 11 years later.\n\nA: Hamster is rather nice if you want one that's got a panel applet.  There is another one that is written in Java called jTimeSched.  This one has been useful on a thumb drive because I can run it on Windows, Mac and Linux, provided the host computer has Java installed. (It is available here and is not in the repositories.)\n\nA: For all fans of Harvest (getharvest.com) i recommend simple gtk application:\nhttps://github.com/tkowalewski/harvest-gtk\n\nA: KTimeTracker is a nice tool and is supported by Canonical.\n\nA: Watson is an open source command-line tool for time tracking. The code is here on Github. It comes with an (optional) server-side backend called crick, which can collect the time tracking data of a team.\nAfter looking around for quite a bit and only finding no longer working / no longer maintained / convoluted / commercial time tracking software for Linux, I found watson and settled for it. It has well throught-through commands so I don't really mind that it's \"only\" a command-line tool.\n\nA: If you access to a web server Kimai is a nice PHP/SQL web application. You configure different clients and for each of them different projects and also different tasks. Also it can be used by many users. The information can be exported to PDF, CSV and XLS.\n\nA: Yes, I'd also recommend TSheets. It's simple to switch back and forth from your jobs to accurately account for the time spent on each project. I also like that it has a Who's Working widget where I can see who on my team is working on what project in real time. \nhttp://www.tsheets.com/workforce-management.html#whos_working\n\nA: Have you tried toggl\nIts an online app but it has a native linux client \n\n\nA: I use gtimelog.\nWell.  I wrote gtimelog.  So it works for me.  YMMV.  I'm not the best software maintainer, I'm afraid.\n\n\nA: You may also try Timedoctor.com.\nThat is what we use in our computers now running on different platforms. I was actually tasked to do research on the best time tracking software today and out of many referrals and suggestions “Time Doctor” is the only software which I could grade as “A”.\n\nA: This might seem an overkill for the OP but it's really useful to deeply track your productivity: RescueTime.\nIt's supported on Linux (besides Mac/Windows). You install a small application that stays in your tray and it tracks all your windows, generating later a report on your productivity.\nIt can automatically categorize a LOT of applications, and for those he understands wrong or doesn't know, you can set what the window means: very productive, productive, neutral, distracting or very distracting. That sums up to a productivity score for your day. You can also ignore some applications that has no actual meaning and you spend very little time on (such as Nautilus/Caja).\nThere's a paid version that adds features such as offline time tracking (you can manually enter what you did, such as meetings or client calls, the app asks what you were doing when your computer was idle!!!!), Zapier integrations, even deeper statistics and other stuff I don't actually know because I didn't use the paid version after the trial :)\nThis was the only application that really helped me stay focused - because I was afraid of receiving that dreaded email by Sunday morning saying I was unproductive D:\n\n\nA: I recommend Emacs with Org-Mode, installed by default together with emacs. Here is a screenshot of a Org-Mode buffer:\n\nWhy Emacs + Org-Mode? to avoid context switch, keeping you in the flow state!!! Sounds a bit radical, right?, I know, but I realized that -- in practice! \nWhen I give Org-Mode a chance I completely abandoned my old way of work and started keep me more focus on what really matter (code). My old workflow was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop code and go mark as done some items;\n\n*Switch to the opened browser, looking for the remember the milk opened TAB;\n\n*Check my TODO tasks for that day and check OUT done items;\n\n*go back to my editor;\n\n*finally, restart the work (may take some more minutes to deeply focus again).\n\n\nWith Org-Mode, I just need to switch to the Org-Mode buffer, pressing Ctrl + x b, and mark items as DONE -- switching back to my previous buffer. No more browser (or external app) + editor.\nI also would like to suggest to adopt The Pomodoro Technique, a really simple technique to get the most out of time management. Its more simple then GTD and easy to use in Emacs + Org-Mode: Put a timer of 25 minutes in all your tasks and Org-Mode will alert you always a task end. Better then ever!\n\nA: arbtt is an automatic rule based time tracker. It looks at the active window titles on your desktop and automatically logs the title. It can catagorize the titles based on how you configure it, and then it can report back stats.\nSo it might report back how much time is spent on a webdomain, in vim, and on facebook so you can look at your productivity. \n\nA: A good one that I have used in the past is Klok, an adobe air application.  It works great for tracking all your different projects, and giving you charts and graphs to break down how you're spending your time.  The free version only exports timesheets in MS Excel format -- they want you to buy the full version for html and xml export.  \n\n\nA: If you have Internet: HarvestApp is one the best tools out there. Thats is if you don't mind time tracking on a web-app.\nsidenote: They have free trial accounts, too.\n\nA: You can also try Fanurio. It is working on multiple platforms including Ubuntu. After installing it they will give a 14 days trial. If you like it you can buy the software to unlock the unlimited edition.\n\nA: We use http://projectsputnik.com. It has amazing time tracking features plus great project management functionality. Additionally you can mark some of time entries as billable and see the ratio of billable hours to total worked hours.\n\nA: From my experience, I would suggest Replicon time clock software for time tracking.\n\nA: I  prefer Rachota. It is a jar file with a simple GUI. http://rachota.sourceforge.net/en/index.html \nIt stores time sheets in XML and there is some options for tracking teams etc. Just download it, place it in your favorite folder and run as java from command line or launcher icon\njava -jar /...folders.../rachota.jar\n\n\nA: TSheets time tracking software has exactly what you're looking for. You'll have the ability to list an unlimited number of jobs for each day and specifically account for the time on the tasks within each job code. Also, it's easy to generate reports that show the breakdown of each task and the project overall. \nhttp://www.tsheets.com/overview-of-online-timesheet-software.php#multi_job_codes\n\nA: Talygen is highly recommended for all those who love to track their time and activities. I've been using Talygen for a couple of months. It helps me track multiple projects. \n\nA: For command-line tool I recommend timew, watson or timetrap.\n", "Q: Setup a local testing SMTP server I need to set up an SMTP server, really the goal is so that this server has no communication with the outside world, I would create the server, and would want a mail client looking at messages the server generates (brownie points if all messages go into the same inbox). This is basically to test out my mail system and see how it looks on different clients, while at the same time not actually sending emails to people.\nAny advice, any known systems that do this?\n\nA: There are two solutions off the top of my head:\nThe first is to install postfix and accept the default configuration. Any mail sent to username@server (or just a username if it's all on one server) would be delivered to that specific user. It's fairly easy to get going and can be expanded to a full mail system in the future without much pain.\nThe second solution, which I leaned of in the Django documentation, is to run:\npython -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25\n\nYou may need to run this as root to claim the port. Any mail that is sent to your server will appear on the terminal as long as you have this running. It's great for testing out mail in different applications.\n", "Q: Upgrade from Kubuntu 9.10 to Ubuntu 10.04 I'm planning to switch from KDE to gnome (Kubuntu to Ubuntu) and from 9 to 10 in one step - \ndo you have any hints what would be the least painful way to do this ? \n\nA: The best thing to do would be to first upgrade to 10.04 normally. Make sure everything is at least working the way you want it to. Then, to start the transition, install the ubuntu-desktop package in Synaptic or via the command-line. That will pull in a bunch of new applications and dependencies.\nAfterwards, reboot, and you'll should have GNOME ready to use. If you don't see it, choose \"Ubuntu Desktop\" or \"GNOME\" from the login screen. You will still have a lot of KDE applications installed at this point; remove or keep whatever you see fit.\nAnother thing to note is that you may be asked which display manager you want to use (gdm or kdm), simply select GDM to get the GNOME display manager and sign in from there. KDM should still work fine as well and you can also continue to use that if you like.\nOnce you've got it all cleaned up, remove the kubuntu-desktop package to stop receiving updates to the Kubuntu distribution on future upgrades. Enjoy.\n\nA: Personally I would always do a fresh install—for any OS, not just Ubuntu. Upgrades are always messy and can leave behind a lot of unwanted packages and conflicting config. Ubuntu has been getting better at not breaking on dist upgrades, but nothing is certain. If you're switching major DEs anyway, it's not as if you really need to keep your existing set of installed packages.\nBackup your home directory and any other places you've put documents, of course (ideally, keep them on a separate partition).\n\nA: I had a number of issues when upgrading from 9.10 to 10.04, mainly because of things I did myself. I had a large number of programs that were from PPAs or testing versions that seemed to give me grief (e.g., Google Earth, Firefox) after the upgrade. My suggestion as well (as @bobince mentioned) would be to back up your data to an external hard drive, wipe your original hard drive and set up a separate partition for Ubuntu and one for your personal data. Going forward, whenever you want to upgrade or if you manage to screw up your install somehow (which I have done on a few occasions) you can always just use the nuclear option to reinstall the whole thing without any data loss. This seems to break it down fairly simply, and can be done as you are reinstalling.\n\nA: Here is an excellent link that provides the solution you are looking for. \nLet me know if you need more help.\n\nA: Posted in the question\nSolution\nFor my case best was to upgrade Kubuntu from 9 to 10:\nsudo apt-get upgrade          # upgrade all existing packages to newest version\nsudo do-release-upgrade       # upgrade system (takes some hours)   \n\nthen switch to Gnome-Ubuntu. \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop   # switch to Gnome on login\n\nWorked absolutely seamlessly.\n", "Q: View PDF with \"fit to page size\" by default Whenever I open a PDF file in Ubuntu, the document viewer shows that file zoomed so that the page width fits to the screen width (and the lower part of the document is not visible). Due to the large monitor I would really prefer to have it show the full document with a smaller zoom instead (I think that might be called \"fit to page size\" in English).\nI found no preference in the document viewer to change its startup behaviour. Is there any preference for that which I missed? Are there alternative PDF viewers which can be configured to fulfill my needs or which have this setting as default?\nThanks for any suggestion.\n\nA: Evince (default PDF viewer) should automatically remember individual display settings for different documents. However, in 10.04, there doesn't appear to be a preference for the default view mode.\nIn Ubuntu 10.10+ (GNOME 2.30+), Evince has an option on the Edit menu for this: \"Save current settings as default\".\n\nIn that case you would change the zoom to Best Fit and set up all of your display preferences, and then activate that option which would apply to future documents. There are other PDF viewers out there that also do this, but I haven't found any as simple to use as Evince.\n\nA: You can also run the following command in the terminal to change the default setting:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince.Default sizing-mode 'fit-page'\n\nIf you also want to have all windows maximized by default, additionally run the following command, replacing 1920, 1080 with your screen size:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince.Default window-ratio '(1920, 1080)'\n\nAfter the first launch of Evince after that, it rewrites that ratio to something else (that still works).\n(Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Evince 3.36.10.)\n", "Q: How to log on to a Ubuntu server; from windows with a plain gui I was hoping to setup and maybe browse the internet from a Ubuntu server i setup at home. Seeing that I have installed, Ubuntu server, I was hoping if there is software I can install to get a browser going on it from my windows PC. is this what vnc4server is for?\nAny links or suggestion helping me on this task, would be appreciated. \nPlease and thank you.\n\nA: Instead of using VNC, you can grab the \"free forever\" version of the Nomachine NX server from www.nomachine.com. Just be sure to install nxnode, nxserver, and nxclient on your Ubuntu server with SSH configured as above. The windows client for this system is also a free download from the same site. This is what I use to do things that are easier in Ubuntu than Windows when I'm away from home and all I have is my laptop. If you're interested I can post more detailed instructions later.\nI have read that NX is less bandwidth-dependent than VNC, so you may get better performance on an insufficient or spotty connection using NX rather than VNC. Good luck with your setup in any case.\n\nA: Assumptions:\n\n*\n\n*This \"server\" is a desktop install (ie the ubuntu-desktop meta package is installed)\n\n*Server sits behind a router which connects to the internet and shares it out through NAT\n\n*Your user is set to auto-login\n\n*You're trying to connect from outside your home network. I had rather assumed you were trying to do this from work but now realise that may not be the case.\n\nStep one: Make your internet connection locatable.\nMost ISPs give their users dynamic IPs. This is as much (try to) stop people hosting things as it is protecting them from people who find out their IP and want to attack their computer directly. Either way, it makes things hard if you want to connect to your home network.\nWe fix this with one of many services that fall under the category \"dynamic DNS\". In short your computer (or router) tells a third party service what your current internet IP is and they store it as a DNS entry. You end up with a domain name that you can connect to your home network through.\nDynDNS is probably the biggest but there are hundreds of companies providing very similar sets of services for free. The good ones have Linux clients available. But check your router as lots come with clients built in and that could save you some time.\nI won't mention this again but it's an essential thing to do.\nStep two: SSH\nRather than connecting directly to a VNC (or other) server, I strongly suggest you install a SSH server and connect to your desktop over SSH and tunnel the VNC port back to your computer. Sounds like a pain in the bottom and.. Well.. It is. But it provides you strong authentication and should keep bad people out. VNC has in the past had quite a few security issues so it's best (IMO) not to give people direct access to it.\nInstalling the server is pretty simple: sudo apt-get install openssh-server\nHowever, I would move it to a non-standard port (mine are all in the 4xxxx range). This helps stop people detecting it by port scanning and therefore helps stop people try and brute force their way in. You can read more about ports here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/openssh-server.html\nAdditionally, you can login over SSH via a key. This is much stronger than password authentication but it requires you have your keyfile with you all the time. Pretty trivial if you're used to taking a USB key around with you or you're happy leaving your key on the Windows computer.\nWe'll stick with password auth for now.\nOne more thing, we need to make it so people outside the network can access the SSH server. This part is called port-forwarding. Simple but it varies from router to router. You should be able to find a guide here if you need one: http://portforward.com/\nStep three: VNC\nI hate VNC but it serves a purpose. It's slow, falls over all the time but it's by far the most simple way to connect to your computer.\nRather than installing a SSH server that runs all the time, I use x11vnc.\nStep four: Putty\nYou need something to connect to SSH from Windows. Putty is that application. Getting and installing the app is simple enough (there are even portable versions if you just want to carry it around on a USB stick).\nWe need to tell Putty to make the remote VNC server available over SSH. This is known as tunnelling. Fortunately it's dead simple. It's graphical so look here for a screenshot guide: http://oldsite.precedence.co.uk/nc/putty.html (Just use port 5900 instead of whatever port they're using!)\nAt this point you should be able to connect to your server over SSH. Test it out. When you're logged in, run x11vnc, it'll detect the display and eventually say something along the lines of \"awaiting connections\".\nAt this point you can run your VNC client (sorry, having not used Windows properly for years, I've no idea what the best client is). When it asks, connect to localhost (yes, localhost), port 5900 (should be default).\nBish bash bosh. You should have full control of your home desktop.\nYou can streamline this with various run-on-connect commands. I'm no Putty expert so I'll leave this to you.\n", "Q: How can I put old Ubuntu CDs to good use? I have a fair number of older Ubuntu CDs sitting around for releases that are not supported anymore. They have beautiful pressed labels and sleeves that I would hate to just throw away.\nWhat can I do with them?\n\n\nA: I would use them, possibly with a clear plastic coating/wrapper, as a 'set' of drink coasters for entertaining. I had some old CDs that I printed labels for that read (in proper album cover art fonts) \"This is a Coaster, Vol. I\" and \"This is a Coaster, Vol. II\", etc. They made me smile all the time and I got some great comments from guests. It would rank up there with the hard drive clock as far as geek decor.\n\nA: Stick them to a wall, on a large frame, for decoration.\n\nA: eBay!\nOn a more serious note, you can use them to test older releases that are still supported for bugs and whatnot. It's also possible some machines may not be able to handle more recent versions of Ubuntu, and these would be perfect. Or use them to take a trip down memory lane and see how the releases have changed. Or you can get creative and build something out of all of the discs - who knows. ;)\nI'm in the same boat: I've got discs as far back as 5.10. Even have some 6.10 discs that never actually made it to shipping to the masses. I'd say they're definitely worth holding on to: you never know what might come up.\n\nA: If you come into contact with older hardware they may come in use!  I built computers from a variety of hardware and having an older version or two of Ubuntu made things much easier than trying to figure out just what exactly wasn't supported in the newer versions.\n\nA: If you have some friends or colleagues which have never experienced Ubuntu (but are open for new suggestions), why not just give them the CDs for trying out Ubuntu? If the CDs are nicely labeled they will even make the same professional impression that a Windows CD makes.\nOn the other hand, if you really want to have friends try out Ubuntu, providing a self burnt image of the current version may lead to a better experience (hardware support etc.). In that case you may still use the sleeves.\nBTW: I also remember a blog post from a LoCo meeting, where old CDs where distributed to interested guests. Maybe there is some kind of social event or meeting in your area where you want to give away those CDs?\n", "Q: Custom php.ini for VirtualHost Is there a way to use a different php.ini file foreach VirtualHost in apache?\nI know that there are the php_admin_values\n<Location /stat/>\n    php_admin_value safe_mode off\n</Location>\n\nBut i want to specify a full php.ini file for a virtualhost.\n\nA: You will need to use something like suPHP to achieve this. In addition to running each VirtualHost's php execution as a different user - it allows you to have multiple php.ini files for VirtualHosts and Directories (Based on .htaccess suPHP_Config flag)\nYou can install suPHP via aptitude: sudo apt-get install suphp-common libapache2-mod-suphp One of the main differences is you can now setup php to be executed as a user - rather than having all php scripts executable by the www-data user - this alone provides a lot of convenience and security when hosting multiple users on one server as it cuts down the needs for 777 and 666 permissions (In fact you should never need to use 777 or 666 ever again - 755/644 should always be sufficient)\nAn example virtual host:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n   ...\n   DocumentRoot /home/marco/www/\n   suPHP_UserGroup marco marco\n   suPHP_Config /home/marco/etc/php.ini\n   ...\n</VirtualHost>\n\nYou can also set the suPHP_Config directive in .htaccess files - provided you have AllowOverride setup properly.\n", "Q: Group share permisssions to windows clients? On our home network we have Ubuntu 10.4 amd64 Desktop functioning as a file server and a couple of WinXP laptops.

The array seems functional from the BIOS standpoint.\nThe problem arises in the installation when it comes to partitioning the drives. The Ubuntu installer only offers me to \"Configure iSCSI volumes\". There are no options offered.\nIt then offers to \"Log into iSCSI targets\" and asks for an IP and port #. I've tried entering the loopback IP, but it says that no iSCSI targets exist there.\nDont know where to go from here. I havent found any documentation on the subject anywhere on the Ubuntu.com and ubuntuforums.org sites...\nAny ideas?\nUpdate 1: I'm running a real hardware RAID using Nvidia CK804 controllers ( 2 of them, 2 HDDs each )\n\nA: The Nvidia CK804 chipset isn't \"real\" hardware RAID, I'm afraid. It's largely software driven, \"fakeRAID\". In Ubuntu you'd use the dmraid driver to utilise it.\nThere is a strong argument for using software RAID instead (performance is very similar and it's much more portable - with caveats). The only reason I'd use fakeRAID over softRAID is if I needed to dual-boot to Windows and needed a shared RAID5 NTFS partition. SoftRAID has better tools, monitoring and support IMO.\nAnyway, if you're still interested in dmraid, read through the Ubuntu Help page on FakeRAID. It's not the clearest of pages but it should get you sorted. You also now know the phrases you'll need to search.\nOn another note, I would also suggest that perhaps the operating system install doesn't need to be on any sort of RAID. I personally leave all the OS data on an SSD and only put parts of user profiles on RAID. There's also a cron job to backup /etc/ to the RAID volume once a day (things don't change that much) and reinstalling is fairly trivial.\n\nA: I found out that Ubuntu installer is confused by some real raid controllers and even thought I can see the partitions in fdisc or gparted, they are not listed by the installer.\nTo solve this problem I have started the Live CD in 'Try Ubuntu` mode and removed the dmraid package. After that I have started the installer and the partitions were there.\nYou can also press Esc or Shift while the CD boots and from 'F6 - Other options' enable the no dmraid options.\nI found uninstalling the dmraid package a better solutions since I don't have to wait for all the boot stepts and detect when the CD is booted.\nHere is the related bug report : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/459054\n", "Q: How do I mount .cue file? I have a cd image that is not a .iso but a .cue. I cannot mount it. I use ubuntu 10.10 64 bits, and I've tried a lot of programs. furiosmout just says it is not a image file, and it just didn't work. I found a program (acetone) that can convert .cue in .iso, but it says I need other packages (that I could not come to). I was looking for an easy way. Any help?\n\nA: Typically a .cue file will be accompanied by a .bin file that contains the actual image data. If you'd like to convert it to the .iso format, the Iso9660 Analyzer Tool (apt-get install iat) should do the trick:\niat my_image.bin my_new_image.iso\n\n\nA: This has been bothering me in the past and I never did find a solution. I set out for an answer and found it on a whim; these instructions are derived from the script on that site.\nYou'll need the .bin file that should be accompanying the .cue file. Note the file sizes: the .bin is likely several hundred MB, while the .cue is probably less than one KB. If you have a large .cue file, it's possible it's named incorrectly, so it doesn't hurt to try this anyway:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install fuseiso (sudo apt-get install fuseiso)\n\n*Run fuseiso -p image_file.bin /path/to/mount, and you should see the mount point fill up with files. This can be run as a normal user, and the directory doesn't have to exist.\n\n*When finished, run fusermount -u /path/to/mount to unmount and remove the directory fuseiso created.\n\n\nHopefully this helps.\n\nA: And also bchunk can do the same trick as iat:\nbchunk IMAGE.bin IMAGE.cue ANYNAME.iso\n\n\nA: The best way is to use cdemu; I regularly use this utility for mounting bin/cue pairs. The program doesn't seem to be in the repositories, but there is a ppa available at Launchpad; you can install it with these steps:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:cdemu/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gcdemu cdemu-client\n\nJust a simple sudo apt-get install cdemu, as suggested here, won't work for this ppa. More information on ppas and how to use them is available here.\nAs outlined in the man page, and reiterated in this useful article, it is simple to use. You can either use the gcdemu gui or issue cdemu commands in terminal.\nJust specify the location of your cue/bin pair (both must be present in the same directory), and run, for example:\ncdemu load 0 /home/mike/isos/Timeshock.cue\n\nTo check that it has loaded, run cdemu status, which will return: \nDevices' status:\nDEV   LOADED     FILENAME\n0     1          /home/mike/DOS/TIMES/Timeshock.cue\n1     0  \n\nTo see the device allocation, enter cdemu device-mapping:\nDevice mapping:\nDEV   SCSI CD-ROM     SCSI generic   \n0     /dev/sr2        /dev/sg4       \n1     /dev/sr3        /dev/sg5 \n\nYou can also cd to /media and run ls to show the new entry:\ncdrom  floppy  floppy0  ISOimage  Timeshock  ZEN STONE\n\nStrangely enough, I still had to click to mount them in my file manager (Thunar).\nYou can unload the image pair by specifying the same device (0) used when loading the pair:\ncdemu unload 0\n\nIf any errors occur, or you can't load or unload your images, just logout and login again.\n\nSide Note: I was able to run Timeshock (a Pinball game) in Wine as the image mounted by cdemu was seen in Wine as H: /media/Timeshock. (The game had been previously installed in Wine) Some games, however, may require the disk to be assigned a D: drive letter in Wine.\nYou can also use cdemu for many other things than just mounting bin/cue pairs, and it may be very useful to anyone who has specific needs to emulate drives or to mount more unusual image types.

I opened Wine configuration page for the first time while music was playing in the background. Just when I opened the Audio tab, the sound stopped working and Wine alerted me about my audio driver. Now my PC has no sound!\nWhat should I do to get back audio? I don't need audio in Wine.\n\nA: To get sound back when Wine destroys it all, you only need to do:\nkillall -9 pulseaudio\nThe pulseaudio system will restart itself in a few seconds, there is no need to manually run it.\nTo avoid this situation I usually try and close apps that will make sound while Wine is running, in particular Firefox with Flash.  I also set my IM status to away (where the client is configured to not make message sounds)\n\nA: Wine and pulseaudio have always had difficulties working together.  If your not sure about the different sound systems available on Ubuntu/Linux, here's a very simplified overview (from my memory, so it may not be 100% correct).\n\n\n*\n\n*OSS Older linux audio subsystem, essentially only allows audio output from one application at a time.  \n\n*ALSA - Newer audio subsystem, allowed output of audio from multiple applications at the same time, however only allowed 1 master volume to control all application volumes (e.g. no turning down the music when you get a call on skype.  You can have sound from both applications, but only at the same volume).\n\n*PulseAudio - Essentially an interface layer that sits on top of ALSA, allows multiple applications to have their own volumes and sound settings. This is the default on Ubuntu.\n\n\nThere are several other differences between each one, but that's all that really matters to the end user as far as I'm concerned.  However Wine and PulseAudio are historically pretty buggy together, and I have a feeling that sound output will die when you run any Wine application (not just winecfg).  You have a few options to prevent this, none of them ideal (ideally you wouldn't have to do anything!)\n\n\n*\n\n*Kill the pulseaudio subsystem before doing anything with Wine.  Open system-monitor, go to the processes tab, highlight pulseaudio process and press \"kill\" (or something along those lines, I'm posting from work).  Alternatively run this at the terminal: killall -9 pulseaudio Then open wine, do your thing and sound should work correctly.  When your done, if you want pulseaudio back, press super+f2, type pulseaudio, and hit enter.\n\n*Alternatively, you can follow the instructions in this blog post to configure wine to use the OSS subsystem.\n", "Q: How to set up an e-mail whitelist My home network is set up as follows:\nPCs -> Wired Network    ---|\n                           |--- Server --- Internet\nPCs -> Wireless Network ---|\n\nThe server runs the fetchmail, postfix and dovecot daemons under Ubuntu to retrive e-mail from the ISP and store it on the server. E-mail is accessed from any of the PCs on the wired or wireless networks via an IMAP interface hosted on the server.\nThis all works great.\nI'm about to let my young children use e-mail for themselves. But before I let them loose on the world, I wanted the server to implement a whitelist for e-mails that are retrieved from the ISP and sent to their mailbox. Ideally, the incoming senders full address should be listed in the whitelist for it to be forwarded to the mailbox. Anything that isn't in the whiltelist should be forwarded to a different mailbox which I can then look through and update the whitelist as appropriate.\nHow do I set up the various daemons to do this?\n\nA: I've accepted aatdark's answer, but here's a more detailed description of what I did (I haven't the rep to edit aatdark's post).\nFirst off, I'm using Ubuntu 9.04.\nAlso, there was no need to install additional packages.\nI had a set up like this:\nISP -> fetchmail -> postfix -> dovecot (for imap access)\n\nI needed postfix to use dovecot's deliver program as that had the ability to run sieve scripts. To do this, edit the main.cf in /etc/postfix and change or add the following:\nmailbox_deliver = /usr/lib/dovecot/deliver\n\nThis tells postfix to use dovecot's deliver program. To get deliver to run sieve scripts, edit dovecot.conf in /etc/dovecot and find the line with \nprotocol lda {\n\nand add the following entries:\npostmaster_address = <some address>\nhostname = <hostname>\nmail_plugins = cmusieve\nsendmail_path = /usr/lib/sendmail\n\nFinally, to implement the whitelist as I originally required, search the dovecot.conf for\nplugin {\n\nadd the following:\nsieve = <location of sieve script> # I have /var/sieve-scripts/%n.sieve, this uses the user name as part of the script filename\n\nand the script file looks like:\nif address :is [\"From\"] \"whitelisteduser@domain\"\n{\n    keep; # we know this user so let it through\n}\nelse\n{\n    redirect \"myemail@domain\"; # redirect everything else\n}\n\nIt's a simple script, I know. But it's a start. I hope there's a way to use an external data source instead of the explicit sender's email address\n\nA: I think sieve can manage what you want achieve.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_%28mail_filtering_language%29\nTo get a fully setup mailsystem + sieve + webmail i can recommend iRedMail ( http://www.iredmail.org/)\nSieve supports the moving and filtering of mails.\n\nA: You need to use some filtering middleware like amavisd. But setting it up is quite complicated, there is a how-to set it up, integrate it in postfix, spamassasin (antispam) and clamd (antivirus) in the community documentation. \nSetting is white-list in amavis is quite easy if you manage to get that far. Just look at the /etc/amavis/conf.d/20-debian rules.\n", "Q: Setting up a new machine with 2 HD Here's the partitioning scheme I set up on a machine with 2 80GB drives:\nSDA\n1) root = 15G\n2) swap = 4G\n3) home = 60G\nOk? Or is there a better scenario?\nThen the partitioner shows the second drive:\nSDB which is 80G and I'm not sure which mount point I should set for the second drive, so I just labeled it as an unused partition for now. Should it be set to /home in order to use the space? Also, I'll replace this one with a bigger drive eventually. With that in mind, what is the best way to deal with the second drive?\nThanks. \n\nA: I'd probably put /home/ on the second drive not in a partition of the first. Specially if you are going to replace it. Just for the extra space.\n\nA: Personally I would wait, putting it in just to take it back out doesn't make sense. If you have no special needs and just want a lot of space you could do like this: (i will imagine that the new disk is a 320GB just for kicks ;)\nsda1  /       75GB\nsda2  \"swap\"  5GB\nsdb1  /home   320GB\n\nBut there are a lot of different ways to set up disks these days! You could also use LVM or Software RAID (try asking google or make another question here) but it's properly not for first time Linux users since this is quite critical :o A software raid0 solution could look like:\nsda1 /       20GB\nsda2 \"swap\"  5GB\nrd0  /home   385GB (sda3 65GB + sdb1 320GB)\n\nPersonally i would just do the first example, but the choice is yours...\n\nA: For a home machine, your chosen set of partitions is great - having /home separate means that you can move it around and upgrade your OS with ease.  Since you have the second disk now, you could put /home on it for now and move it to the new drive when it arrives.  Then the upgrade steps would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the new drive in the machine beside the existing ones (3 drives at once temporarily)\n\n*format the new drive with a big partition and mount it anywhere\n\n*copy all of your data from your current /home to the new partition\n\n*remove the old drive and plug the new one in where it was\n\n\nIf your new drive is plugged into the same spot as the old one was (and has the same number of partitions), it should be detected with the same drive/partition id (eg sdb1), and you shouldn't even need to edit /etc/fstab.\n[edit: clarified that you would need the same partition scheme on the replacement drive to get the same drive/partition id]\n\nA: I like a partitioning scheme like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ around 50GB\n\n*swap 2xram space\n\n*/media/big space for movies, mp3s, games, ...\n\n*I had a partition for /home/user/.wine because Windows games take a lot of space, but lately I had trouble because wine couldn't use the files of the old installation\n\n\nAdvantage of putting the space under /media and not /home: if you want a clean install it's much easier like this. And I don't know if you can use the same /home partition for different Linux OS. Furthermore you could make your space partition NTFS to share it with a Windows installation.\n\nA: If you're going to keep having two drives, I recommend that you put them to good use: replicate all your important files on the two drives. It's called software RAID1; Linux supports this reliably and efficiently. That means your disk partitions would look like this:\nfirst disk            second disk\nsda1  md0             sdb1  md0\nsda2  swap            sdb2  swap\nsda3  /LARGE          sdb3  /MORE\n\nmd0 is a RAID1 volume; sda1 and sdb1 automatically contain identical data. That way, if one of your disks fails, you don't lose any important files, and you can continue working with your computer until you get the failed disk replaced.\nmd0 would contain two partitions: / (for the operating system) and /home (for your important data — stuff that you created, as opposed to stuff that you downloaded or ripped or compiled from somewhere). I like to have 20GB for the OS (I install a lot more programs than the average user). It's hard to say how large /home should be: it depends what data you (plan to) have that you consider important.\nThe Ubuntu installer can create RAID1 volumes, but you need the “alternate” or “server” installer, not the default “desktop” installer.\n", "Q: How to Reset Default Window Effects I was dumb and removed all the window effects under the compiz manager animation settings and I was wondering how to reset the window effects to what they were by default (using gnome). \nUpdate 1\nI think there's been some confusion regarding what, exactly, is being asked.

But still I seem to have this version 6.5.7 around.\nI guess my question is how do I remove/disable ImageMagick 6.5.7-8? \n\nA: It's likely you installed imagemagick 6.5.7 to /usr/local, if you can't find it in your package listing.\nTry which convert to see where imagemagick binaries are located. (convert is one of the utilities shipped with imagemagick.) Also try convert --version to see which version is active. If you get a different version than what Ruby/Rails is seeing, check your project configuration to make sure you don't have any extra paths it may be looking in. Also, be sure that imagemagick wasn't installed to your Rails app directory; I think it may try to include things there as well.\n\nA: I'm up and running! Solution posted here on Stack Overflow. \n", "Q: Increase space for /root in Ubuntu Wubi \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs it possible to extend the disk space available to a wubi install? \n\nI have ubuntu 10.04 installed inside Windows 7 through Wubi. I need to increase the size of /root or root.disk. How can I do this? wubi-add-virtual-disk does not work since root.disk is already present.\n\nA: Found this information on the wiki:\n\nHow do I resize the virtual disks?\nYou can use LVPM, at http://lubi.sourceforge.net/lvpm.html\nAs an alternative, you can use the following script to move /home to a dedicated virtual disk.\nDownload wubi-add-virtual-disk, open a terminal and run:\nsudo sh wubi-add-virtual-disk /home 15000\n\nWhere the first argument is the directory to move to a new dedicated disk, and the second argument is the size in MB.\nYou should now reboot. If you are happy with the result, you can now remove /home.backup. To undo the changes remove /home, copy rename /home.backup to /home and remove the /home line in /etc/fstab.\nNote that contrary to previous information, this script is not suitable for moving /usr - experienced users may be able to do this manually, at own risk, following a process similar to that outlined in the file. (Do not rename /usr until the very last moment, as rsync is installed there.)\n\nSo, essentially you do need to create a new disk, move your data over to it (it seems like this script might do that for you, but I'm not completely sure) and then remove the backup image when you're satisfied.\n", "Q: What's a good cctv app to start out on? Zoneminder or Motion? I've been asked to put together a cctv solution for a small business. Ubuntu is my choice OS, and I'm looking at Zoneminder or Motion as the app of choice. Any experience with one or the other? Also, any recommendations on cameras? I'm thinking we'll try a stock usb webcam to begin with, but I have no experience in this area. The store area is about 25 feet long, 10 feet wide, with large west-facing windows.\n\nA: I have had good success with Motion and the logitech webcam pro 9000.\nOne note of caution, in the motion package that is in the repositories for 9.10 I had to add the following lines to the init.d script.\nmkdir -p /var/run/motion\nchown motion:motion /var/run/motion\nafter the DEFAULTS entry.\nOther than that, works pretty well. It outputs whatever the camera is seeing to a web port so you can monitor it from either your network or via ssh tunnel. The config file is pretty simple too. It outputs to both still images and creates flv files which are better for reviewing several hours of motion capture quickly.\n", "Q: When I resume from suspension - the screen is blank I use ubuntu 10.04 in HP Pavilion dv4 2165 dx. After putting my computer in suspend, when I open the scree comes very low brightness; even I cannot see anything there, so eventually I press the power button to shut down and start it again. It happens every time. How to solve this problem.\nthanks\n\nA: It looks like you're affected by bug #578673 (the key for searching was to search for the model of your video controller: Intel HD Graphics). Make sure you have recommended updates (lucid-updates) checked in the “Updates” tab of the Update Manager settings, and that you have the latest kernel (at least 2.6.32-24.42).\nIf that doesn't help, read through the comments and see if someone has made a suggestion that might help you. If you can't find anything, report a new bug. Be sure to mention your exact hardware and kernel version and that the fix for bug #578673 didn't help you.\n", "Q: Panel applets are jumbled on login Sometimes when I login, I see that the applets (notification area, evolution applet, session applet, indicator applet and workrave applet) are jumbled up - they appear in some random order.\n\nOnly change I remember doing recently is to delay execution of startup applications as described here\n\nA: If your panel is jumbled up, you can try reloading the panel by running the following command in a terminal or the Alt+F2 run dialog:\nkillall gnome-panel\n\n\nA: Have you recently change you monitor setup? Whenever I switch between and external monitor and the internal monitor the applets are usually jumbled.\nTo fix it, right-click on the all the applets and make sure \"Lock to Panel\" is not selected. Now, right-click on all the applets and click move. Drag you mouse to the place you wish for the applets you want moved, then click.\n\nA: It is indeed a problem with attaching an external monitor of a different resolution and going between that and the default screen.\nI switch monitors frequently and my applets always get jumbled like crazy, whether locked or not, even if I refresh it.\nWhat I finally did was moved everything to Avant Window Manager since it scales with my resolution and doesn't mess up from changing monitors.\n", "Q: \"input/output error during read on /dev/sda\" during installation At the moment my laptop does not have any OS. I am trying to install Ubuntu 10.04 using a live cd, which runs perfectly, but after the initial installation steps it shows an\n\ninput/output error during read on /dev/sda\n\nand the installation stops.\nI am selecting the option to erase and use the entire disk. I also tried doing manual partitioning - of the 60 GB hard disk I allowed 52 GB to be the root partition formatted as ext4, and the rest to be a swap area, but I still got the same error.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: From your description, it sounds like your disk is dying. To confirm this, I suggest using a low-level disk integrity checking tool, like Salvation HDD Scan and Repair\nFormatting the disk will only resolve problems at the filesystem level. If the aforementioned tool detects any errors, your only recourse will be to replace the disk.\n\nA: I have experienced this problem because of bad installation media. Download from torrent or check the MD5 sums against the ones here.\n\nA: I had this problem too; I fixed it by changing the HDD to SATA mode in BIOS.\nSee this post for more details.\n\nA: Try some diagnosis on your drive, the Ubuntu-live-cd has a pretty good disc-analysis-tool! Else try SystemRescueCd 1.6.0. These tests will give you an idea if your drive is still ok.\n", "Q: Fan won't turn on. How do I turn it on manually? I just got done installing Ubuntu 10.04 on an acer laptop. The fan was working fine in Vista but now with Ubuntu the fan doens't turn on, so now it's overheating after an hour or so of use. What's wrong? And if I have to, how do I turn on the fan manually?\nP.S. Not my laptop, it's a friend's daughter's.\n\nA: *\n\n*File a bug. Even if there is a bug that looks like it matches yours exactly, go ahead and file a new, unique bug.\n\n*Download the current daily iso. Put it onto a usb drive and boot into the live image to see if that has the same problem.\n\nA: Of all the people to answer my question, I wouldn't have expected my Dad! He found the solution here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=4925392&postcount=117\nThat script is written for exactly the model I'm dealing with, an Acer Aspire 5720z with 2gigs of RAM, though it can be edited for any other model in that line.\nInstalling that script fixed it. Now the fan runs the way it should.\n\nA: Don't use it (with Ubuntu) until you find a fix. Constant overheating will eventually kill it dead.\nYou don't specify the model. Please edit your question to show exactly which model we're talking about.\nBut I've have seen this problem before around the internet. Everything I've seen suggests that downloading and installing a BIOS update (available from the Acer website) should fix this.\n\nA: If nothing else works, you might try fancontrol.\nPackage name is just \"fancontrol\". Depends on lm-sensors, which is probably already installed on the laptop. Use pwmconfig script to configure it. Use sudo pwmconfig as it needs elevated privileges.\nFancontrol gets and sets settings for fan speed, temperatures at which to start and stop the fans, and so forth. \nOn my laptop, pwm-config complains the \"There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed\"\nRunning sensors-detect results in \"Sorry, no sensors were detected.\"\nRunning sensors one temp1 sensor, an ACPI virtual device.\nMy laptop runs ok, I only mention those errors in case you or others run into the same problems and other answerers have relevant information.\n", "Q: How do I start dhcp3-server automatically on startup?

I found a fix for it and just wanted to post an update with what I had to do.\nThe trick was to edit the init file.  Change the \"start on...\" line.  Add the following to the end of the line: \nand net-device-up IFACE=<your DHCP server IP>\n\nSo my my \"start on\" line looks like this now:\nstart on runlevel [2345] and net-device-up IFACFE=eth1\n\nThe problem was that the dhcp server was trying to start before eth1 was ready.  This makes it wait until eth1 is up and ready before trying to start the dhcp server.\n", "Q: What webcam can I buy that works out of the box with Ubuntu? I need to set up a video conference, yet I have no webcam. I'm looking to buy something that works out of the box with Ubuntu 10.04, and as many possible conferencing apps as possible. Can anyone recommend me something I might be able to find at a local store? \n\nA: You might want to have a look at the Hardware Compatibility List from Ubuntu, especially the section about webcams.\n\nA: You can take a look here.\n\nMany webcams will \"just work\" in Ubuntu. There is a USB standard that defines USB streaming video called UVC. This stands for Universal Video Class, and it does for webcams what UMS does for USB memory sticks and hard drives. This allows one driver to work with many webcams. When looking to purchase a webcam for use with Ubuntu, you should look for a UVC compatible camera. The Linux-UVC project has a good list of UVC compatible webcams as well as The Quickcam Team for Logitech cameras.\n\nWhat you can do is test the webcam at the store with a LiveCD or your laptop. If you have a desktop you can test it at home and if it doesn't work you return it. This last thing is what I did when I bought my webcam (Genius iSlim 330 - works out of the box).\n\nA: Most will just work. Getting a definitive list is somewhat harder because the list varies from kernel (and its UVC version) to kernel.\nIn my experience, the cheaper, the better. As soon as you start getting into software-controlled things like tracking and flashes, you tend to need drivers that just aren't available. Dirt-cheap webcams seem to all share common hardware.\nIf in doubt, buy something that isn't in a sealed box so you can return it if it doesn't work.\n\nA: See this,\nSupported cams: \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras\n\nA: The Logitech C200 has been reported as a webcam that works out of the box on Lucid,\nMost UVC compliant webcams will work in Linux in general, here is a list of UVC Compliant cam hardware from Logitech: http://www.quickcamteam.net/devices/logitech_uvc_device_list.pdf\n\nA: According to the webcam page on the wiki, there is a list on the Linux UVC page that keeps track of compatible cameras.\nPersonally I've had great support with Logitech cameras. They have a page that shows which models work with Linux out of the box.\n\nA: The Creative Live! Cam Socialize HD works great - just plug it in... A bit pricey perhaps, but a good quality cam.\n/N\n\nA: I have a Logitech C500 that has worked like a charm out of the box. Caveat: it does not work well with Cheese Webcam Booth by default- none of the webcams I have tried work well with Cheese. The C500 yields an acceptable picture after tweaking the preferences in Cheese.\nIt works perfectly with guvcviewer.\n\nA: Most of them work out of the box. If you use Skype see the list for compatibility\n\nA: I am using a Logitech \"QuickCam Pro for Notebooks\". It works fantastic out of the box on my Karmic and Lucid boxes. Most time I use it for video conference with Skype and sometimes for a little bit of fun with Cheese.\n\nA: WebCam A4 Tech 16.0Megapixel PK-810 G -> works out of the box with Kubuntu 13.04, including audio.\n", "Q: Banshee syncs to ipod but then there are no songs/playlists on the ipod My current setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04  \n\n*Banshee 1.6 (I followed the instructions to set up the PPA and get the latest version)  \n\n*IPod 5th gen video (MA147LL) with firmware 1.3  \n\n\nHere is the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*I restore the Ipod on a windows machine  \n\n*I plug in the Ipod on the Ubuntu machine  \n\n*I set the sync preferences to be \"Sync to \" and \"Sync when connected and when libraries change\"  \n\n*Banshee says it is syncing with the Ipod  \n\n*When it says it's done, I disconnect the Ipod and there are no songs or playlist on the Ipod  \n\n*When I plug the Ipod back into the Ubuntu box, Banshee tells me the database on the ipod is too new or needs to be repaired.  \n\n\nIf log snippets or anything else would help in resolving this, please let me know.\nEDIT:\nSo it doesn't work with 1.7.5 either.\nHere is the link to the bug I opened for this:\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=629838\n\nA: Banshee 1.6's support for newer ipods can be hit and miss. However the Banshee team have been working pretty hard to make this work on newer versions by porting it to gio/udev. This improves ipod support, but unfortunately is not out in stable form yet.\nHowever you can use the following PPA if you want to use the current 1.7.x development release:\nppa:banshee-team/banshee-unstable\nIf you want to follow the stable releases of Banshee (which will have 1.8 when it comes out) you can use this PPA:\nppa:banshee-team/ppa\nI recommend using the 1.7 PPA for now, and when 1.8 is released switching to that PPA and you should be good. I've been using 1.7 for a while now and I haven't had problems. From your question it looks like you're running the stable PPA already, so switching to the unstable one for now should do  the trick.\nIf it doesn't work in 1.7, then you've found a bug, you should report that to the Banshee developers.\n\nA: I don't know of any other tools that do this, but Amarok2 can scan your ipod for 'stale and orphaned tracks' which should fix your songs not showing up.  Also, always make sure to properly eject your device, that has always been my number one reason why my ipod ends up 'empty' after just being synced.\n", "Q: How do I enable visual effects when running Ubuntu as a Guest machine in VirtualBox? I have Ubuntu 10.04 64bit guest with Windows 7 64-bit host. I do have 3D Acceleration enabled in Virtualbox settings.\nEvery time I enable visual effects in Ubuntu the Virtualbox GUI crashes. What do I need to do to have visual effects enabled in Ubuntu? Virtualbox's logs don't say anything useful at crash.\nMy graphics card is an Nvidia 8800 GTS with the latest 258.96 drivers, but I'm sure that's not part of the issue.\n\nA: Inside the guest, install the package virtualbox-ose-guest-x11 and restart the VM; that may resolve the issue. X on the guest needs to be aware of the VirtualBox drivers, and as far as I know this is the way to go about that. Versions 2.2 and up should make this functionality seamless, but it's possible there are some bugs in there.\nAlso, be sure you've allocated plenty of video memory in the VM settings. I gave it a go just now with 128 MB VRAM (which might be excessive) and it worked fine after installing the -x11 package I mentioned. Start high if you can and lower it if you need to until it stops working.\n\nA: I thought the 2D and 3D acceleration support for guests was only in the PUEL edition of VirtualBox, and not in the OSE version.  (I'm likely wrong about this, I'm much more familiar with the PUEL, not with OSE version of VirtualBox.)\nEither way, I'd install the guest additions that come with your exact edition/version of VirtualBox, not what happens to be in Synaptic.  Click on Devices->Intall Guest Additions.  Once you click on Devices->Install Guest Additions, if that doesn't make the VBox CD image available on your guest desktop, reboot the guest.

Following is the entry which I added:-\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.32-24-kgdb' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n        recordfail\n        insmod ext2\n        set root='(hd0,1)'\n        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 12878c3b-c553-4b4b-986a-6e32daea3ad1\n        linux   /vmlinuz-2.6.32-kgdb root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu-root ro kgdbwait kgdboe=@192.168.140.23/,@192.168.140.158/  quiet\n        initrd  /initrd.img-2.6.32-24-server\n}\n\nI have also compiled and copied /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15.5-kgdb & /boot/System.map-2.6.15.5-kgdb to target m/c from devlopement m/c. \nSTD entry before adding KGDB in grub.cfg was:-\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.32-24-server' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n        recordfail\n        insmod ext2\n        set root='(hd0,1)'\n        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 12878c3b-c553-4b4b-986a-6e32daea3ad1\n        linux   /vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-server root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu-root ro   quiet\n        initrd  /initrd.img-2.6.32-24-server\n}\n\nPlease suggest how to get rid of this problem.\n\nA: If you are using grub2 (which was the default in 10.04), menu entries should not be manually added to grub.cfg. Instead they can be added in  /etc/grub.d/40_custom or you can drop a new file in /etc/grub.d/. More GRUB2 info can be found here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Custom Menu Entries\nAs for the KGDB kernel itself, I'm certainly not an expert here. My understanding is that you need to also set kgdb8250=<port number>,<port speed>. You might try looking here for more KGDB specific help:\nhttp://kgdb.linsyssoft.com/docu.htm\n", "Q: Upgrading kernel and drivers in a BackTrack ISO I'm using the latest BackTrack ISO release for security analysis. BackTrack is basically a configured Ubuntu distro. However, I'm missing my wireless card driver (Broadcom 4313). There are several forum posts on the site explaining how to upgrade the kernel and install the drivers. However, I use the ISO file from a USB drive as a \"Live CD\" (i.e., no installation) and can therefore not change the original ISO.\nMy question is: how can I take an ISO file (any, for this matter), update its contents and repackage it to a new ISO that can be live-mounted? is there a procedure for this? Do I need to use a virtual machine?\n\nA: I had used isomaster in the past to add BIOS update programs to a FreeDOS iso. I believe that it is what you want. You can find it in add/remove programs.\n\n\nA: Modifying an Ubuntu live CD is trickier than just replacing files in the ISO image.\nThe root filesystem of the live operating system is actually contained within a compressed SquashFS data file. The modification process typically consists of unpacking the SquashFS file, chrooting into the extracted filesystem, making your modifications, exiting the chroot, repacking the SquashFS file, and then regenerating the ISO.\nThis procedure is well described on the LiveCDCustomization page of the Ubuntu wiki.\nMy only experience is with adding packages to the live CD, but there isn't any reason you shouldn't be able to use this to replace the kernel, provided you can compile it successfully.\n", "Q: How to have pidgin chat windows open up on all workspaces? I use pidgin as my chat client on ubuntu lucid. Whenever I have a chat window open, I like to mark it as \"Always on visible workspace\" as it's just more convenient.\nIs there a way that I can force chat windows to already be marked as that when they open up? So, if someone started a conversation with me on gtalk (for instance) the window would automatically be on all workspaces, and I wouldn't have to mark it manually.\n\nA: If you are using compiz (desktop effects), you can set up “window rules“. Install compizconfig-settings-manager and open it in the System->Preferences menu. Chose the plugin Window rules and set a rule identifying the Pidgin window (for example using its title) and set the sticky attribute for such windows. \nYou can find an explanation for the various possible rules here: http://wiki.compiz.org/WindowMatching but the compiz settings manager also allows for simply clicking on a window to set up a matching rule.\n\nA: On systems without Compiz, you can also accomplish this using Devil's Pie and the following configuration in ~/.devilspie/pidgin.ds:\n(if (is (application_name) \"Pidgin\")\n    (if (is (window_role) \"conversation\")\n        (pin \"TRUE\")\n    )\n)\n\n", "Q: Move RAID1 to new machine I have an older server with / on one hard drive and /srv on a RAID1 partition, which I remember took some time to set up (I set it up after the installation). I will be installing Ubuntu 10.04 onto a new server, but would like to take the /srv hard drives to the new machine.\nWhat steps need to be taken to ensure a complete and proper migration? Should I tell the installer about the additional drives, or connect them after setup has completed?\nFor reference, I will be installing the \"Standard\" Ubuntu desktop, and adding server applications, rather than installing a \"Server\" Ubuntu and adding desktop applications.\n\nA: I checked in a VirtualBox: The Desktop Installer does not recognize existing mdadm Raid1 devices. \nYou should \n\n\n*\n\n*install ubuntu\n\n*plugin the 2 raid hdds afterwards. \n\n*(you should reboot to be on the safe side)\n\n*Then install mdadm with sudo apt-get install mdadm\n\n*cat /proc/mdstat You should see your inactive RAID\n\n*sudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md_d0 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 (change the sdb1 and sdc1 to your raid partitions)\n\n*sudo mdadm --detail --scan\nThe output on my system is:\n  berni@virtual2:~$ sudo mdadm --detail --scan\n  ARRAY /dev/md/d0 level=raid1 num-devices=2 metadata=00.90 UUID=bcb40263:0fe2be0e:4a925ea7:19eea675\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the whole ARRAY .. line to the end of /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf\n\n*Now your raidconfig is preserved and you can use /dev/md0 as a normal device\n\n*For example sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid\nThis stuff is working on Lucid & Maverick\n", "Q: What are some good PHP editors? I'm currently using PhpStorm by Idea JetBrains, but its buggy and I'm really looking for something that will allow me to get work done without too much hassle.\nPlease limit one IDE/Editor an answer.\n\nA: Bluefish \nThis is another good editor that supports PHP and is more web-focused than Gedit or Geany so may be more suitable for PHP. You can install it from the package bluefish.\n\nA: I suggest using the Eclipse PHP development tools\nYou can use the same IDE on all systems and in addition to the simple features of a text editor you get all the additional stuff that you need for larger projects: context aware code completion, refactoring, integration of versioning systems, issue tracking, deployment to remote servers and much other stuff.\n\nA: I'm using both Komodo Edit and Geany.\nKomodo is (imho) better but is a bit too weighty, especially with big files that reference many other files (in your file includes another one, Komodo scan it to get the function/classes it contains and offer them in the auto-completition function).\nFor big files I use geany; it's really fast and complete.\n\nA: Netbeans is a great IDE with lots of PHP support.  I can't even start to name all the features I use but there are a fair amount.  Check it out here:   \n\n\n*\n\n*http://netbeans.org/features/scripting/index.html    \n\n*http://netbeans.org/features/php/index.html\nI've used both Eclipse for Java and Netbeans for PHP and I feel Netbeans is a bit stronger for PHP as well as XHTML and CSS. That's my personal preference anyways.    \nLooking at PHPStorm I assume you're looking for something similar to it, so a full IDE.\nNetbeans and Eclipse are the closest to that as far as I'm familiar with.  \nNetbeans has most, if not all, the features that PhpStorm has on that page plus a whole lot more.\n\n\nA: Quanta Plus is part of the kde web development package and is a good solution for KDE users.\n\nA: Try a slightly pimped version of gEdit. This the way to do it:\nsudo apt-get install gedit gedit-plugins\ncd ~/Downloads\ngit clone http://github.com/gmate/gmate.git\ncd gmate\nsh ./install.sh\n\nWith the plugins you can enhance even more.\n\nA: Geany \nThis is an advanced editor/lightweight IDE with lots of features. Like Gedit, it has syntax highlighting for PHP and is extendible through plugins. It has some more advanced features than Gedit such as code folding. It can be installed from the repositories by installing the package geany and optionally geany-plugins.\n\n\nA: I use Eclipse with Aptana\nAfter having installed Aptana you can add some additional plugin, as php development tools, subclipse etc.\n\nA: vim\nWell, you have to work a little at the start to make it an IDE but it's great once you do it. It has GUI version called GVim as well. Install it with\nsudo apt-get install vim-gtk\n\nhere are some tips on making it work with PHP and here are the list of plugins you can use to enhance vim to better work with php.\n\nA: Gedit\nThis comes pre-installed with Ubuntu and is simple and lightweight. It has syntax highlighting for a very large number of languages including PHP. It is extensible using plugins.\n", "Q: Getting screen resolution correct with nvidia drivers I have a new install of ubuntu.\nUpon first installing the nvidia drivers are not active and I get the correct screen resolution. 1680x1050\nThen I install the nvidia drivers and the best resolution I can get is 1280x1024.\nIn searching around there is a lot of information related to this and similar issues.

In searching the forums and other web sites I've found LOTS of others with similar issues, but it's all so scattered that it's hard to tell which ones are not dead ends.

When you delete the file Ubuntu or Xorg will detect that it is missing and attempt to rebuild it, guessing at sane settings. If the settings are not satisfactory then you can change them if necessary- but starting over with a \"clean\" auto-generated xorg.conf is a good way to make sure leftover parts of the configuration aren't tripping you up.\nPLEASE NOTE that this worked for me in 9.10 but I have not tested it in 10.04.

reset on it and set it up from scratch with basically just the defaults so I seriously doubt that's the problem.\n\nA: Since ifconfig shows wlan0, I think that the driver is installed and working, so there is probably some other problem...\nSo, just an initial stab at eliminating the most common problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you installed the package \"wpasupplicant\"? This package provides functionality for encrypted network connections (WPA)\n\n*Have you manage to successfully connect to the network before? If the router you're trying to connect to has a MAC-filter (i.e. the router is setup to only allow connections from a configured list of computers/network cards), you may need to properly configure the router...\n\n*If none of the above works, you may try installing the package 'linux-backports-modules-wireless-lucid-generic'\n/N\n\nA: Try downloading the latest drivers from Ralink.com. I have an MSI with a similar card and had to build the drivers from source. It's very easy to do, and it now works perfectly.\n\nA: you should be able to find more info in the syslog.  For example, when I connect to a network, it shows this:\nSep 17 15:13:11 excelsior NetworkManager:   Activation (wlan0) successful, device activated.\nSep 17 15:13:11 excelsior NetworkManager:   Activation (wlan0) Stage 5 of 5 (IP Configure Commit) complete.\nafter some other messages about DHCP and address info.\n\nA: I've experienced difficulties with Realtek wifi-card on Ubuntu 9.10/10.04. Following this guide at least made the wifi-card usable. Limited support in 9.10/10.04 for my Realtek card is a known issue. I often, but not always, lost connection, when my session timed out.\nWorkaround (9.10/10.04): I simply turned off the wireless access and turned it on again using NetworkManager applet. Not elegant, but it worked.\nSolution: Upgrading to 10.10 (beta) has provided flawless support so far.\n\nA: Ok, ruling out the simple things...\nHave you actually checked that the transciever (router) is not of the older wireless systems? (Wireless A, B, etc etc).\nI'm unaware of your network situation, or your level of knowledge; but a similar sounding problem I know of was resolved due to the older router being unable to make sense of wireless N devices.\nAlso, early wireless devices are unable to connect to multiple machines. \nAgain, apologies if that was a patronizing answer, but it can't hurt to help! :)\n\nA: Install this kernel please:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.33.3-lucid/\nRT2860 driver in Ubuntu 10.04 has issues that prevent it working.

I found a folder called ~/.local/share/TpLogger/logs. If I just copy that folder, and paste it into a new installation, will my logs be preserved? Or will they not be associated with the new accounts? I don't want to risk it until I know for sure.\n\nA: ~/.local/share/TpLogger/logs is the path to the empathy logs.  The version of Empathy in Maverick uses telepathy-logger to log.\nI haven't tested restoring those, but I think account names are consistent, so should work.\n\nA: Yes, that will work on Ubuntu 10.10.\nOn 10.04 (and I assume older versions), the folder you need to copy is ~/.local/share/Empathy/logs/\n. \nIf you use nautilus (the default file manager) to copy/paste the folder, you will need to allow it to 'merge' the folders when you paste.\nYou could use this command to backup:\ncp -r ~/.local/share/Empathy/logs/* /path/to/backup/directory/empathy-logs\n\nor  cp -r ~/.local/share/TpLogger/logs/* /path/to/backup/directory/empathy-logs\nAnd this command to restore:\n cp -r /path/to/backup/directory/empathy-logs/* ~/.local/share/Empathy/logs/\n\nor   cp -r /path/to/backup/directory/empathy-logs/* ~/.local/share/TpLogger/logs/\n", "Q: Installing Mercurial: start with Ubuntu Desktop or Server? I need to set up a Mercurial server for experimentation.  The setup will be in a virtual machine, and I figured this was a good time to check out Ubuntu (the other option was Windows).\nThe Mercurial server will be light use; as it is purely for lab / demonstration purposes; however, I need to set up a full multi-repository server, which requires a web server (Apache seems to be the obvious choice).\nSo, the question is: should I start with Ubuntu Desktop or Server?\nThanks!\n\nA: It doesn't really matter - you can install the same packages (such as apache2) on Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop.\nIf you start with Ubuntu Desktop, you will need to install server related packages whereas Ubuntu Server comes with them pre-installed. You will also probably want to uninstall software not required for a server.\nIf you start with Ubuntu Server and need/want a graphical user interface (by default it is just command line) and desktop applications, you will have to install these.\nUbuntu Server FAQ\n", "Q: How to setup Shotwell for multi-user access? Typical use case: A family notebook with multiple user accounts.\nHow do I setup Shotwell so all users have access to the same photo directory and each is able to import photos?\n\nA: dalloliogm is partially right, but it's not like we never considered it.\nFirst, if you have multiple users who want to use Shotwell on their own photo libraries, and they have their own accounts on the machine, then everybody can log in to their own account and have their own database and their own picture library.  That's true for Shotwell out-of-the-box.\nIf you're expecting each user to have their own database and picture directory but not have their own account on the machine, there is a solution.  Run Shotwell like this:\n$ shotwell --datadir=<datadir>\n\nShotwell will use the supplied directory to hold the database and other assorted files for the library.\nThe larger problem is one where you want all the users to share the same photos, as in, the assorted Shotwell databases point to the same physical photos.  We currently have no support for updating the database if the backing file is changed or moved.  The next release (0.8) should have better support for this, as it will scan the library at startup and also optionally monitor the user's library for run-time changes.\nAlso, Shotwell is a non-destructive editor.  If one user crops a photo, for example, the other users won't see that change because the backing file has not changed.  Synchronizing databases is something we're thinking of, but it's not a simple problem.\n\nA: I have just tried this method and it seems to work but I can't guarantee it's bug-free, so use it at your own risk.\n1.Press Alt+F2 and type gksudo nautilus then press enter.\n2.Enter your password, nautilus will start with administrator rights.\n3.Browse to /home and right click -> Create folder, name it as \"shotwell_common\". Then right click on it, then click on properties-permissions. Give read+write access to \"others\". After that right click on the folder again then click on \"Make Link\". A link will be created there(in /home) named \"link to shotwell_common\".\n4.Create another folder in /home named \"shotwell_library\" and change the permissions as above.\n5.Start nautilus by clicking on Places->Home Folder from the menu on panel and press Ctrl-H. A folder named \".shotwell\" will be visible. Delete it. Now copy the \"link to shotwell_common\" from /home to /home/user and rename it \".shotwell\". Then launch shotwell and go to Edit->Preferences. Enter the path /home/shotwell_library as library location. \n6.Import atleast one image file into shotwell. Shotwell's \"photobrowser.db\" file will be now created inside /home/shotwell_common.\n7.Launch terminal and type sudo chmod -R o+rw /home/shotwell_common and press enter, as usual it will ask for password blah blah.\n8.Repeat step-5 for every user of your computer.\n9.You may now delete \"link to shotwell_common\" from /home now following step-1/2/3.\nDon't forget to tell your family members two points:\na)When they import some images they should always choose the \"copy to library\" option.\nb)They have no privacy while using shotwell now. \n\nA: Either create a new partition or earmark an existing one for sharing all types of files between all the users of the notebook. Add an entry for the partition in your /etc/fstab file so that the partition is mounted in /media during boot. That way, every user will be able to access the files inside the partition from their respective desktops. \n\nA: The reason why Shotwell doesn't have support for multiple users is because the developers didn't think of this use-case, and nobody asked them to implement it. \nSo the best thing you can do is to open a feature request ticket in their bug tracker application, and see what the developers answer you. Alternatively, you can write to their mailing list.\n\nA: Shotwell 0.15.0 on Mint 16.\nI'm using;\nshotwell -d \"/home/dan/.shotwellMultiLibrary/Dans\"\n\nand\nshotwell -d \"/home/dan/.shotwellMultiLibrary/Others\"\n\nto maintain two libraries, which seems to be working for starting up in the right library, except that the preferences are shared, so the 'watch' library (and other preferences settings) are incorrectly picked up from the last used.\nGuess this might be related to https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=718721\nPerhaps the later versions which haven't yet made it to the repo may fix this problem?\n", "Q: Debugging python memory leaks I'm trying to debug a memory leak in telepathy-butterfly. I tried to use valgrind, but Empathy does not connect to MSN when telepathy-butterfly is run this way.\nSo, I figured out the only option left is to debug the memory leak by printing object sizes from within the code.\nI was able to get all objects (using the gc module) and print their sizes and types. The leak seems to come from a dictionary (or dictionaries), which have no __name__ property, so I can't tell where their coming from.\nI tried to check all objects in globals(), but it looks like they are not related to the dictionaries that leak.\nSince this is my first time hunting memory leaks in unfamiliar python code, I thought it is best to ask for advice.

When booting from the server or alternative install CD, there are some choices tied to function keys (F4, F6, etc.) along the bottom of the screen.  Some are relatively obvious, others... not so much so, or least it'd sure be nice to be able to read a description of what the intended usage is before committing to an install process only to find that I should have left well enough alone ;)\nI can't seem to find a description of these options in the official documentation... anyone know where it might be squirreled away, or who I could get ahold of to find out?\n\nA: The boot options for the desktop CD are documented (incompletely) at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions; there doesn't seem to be a page for the server CD, but many options are the same.\nDon't worry too much about these options: for the most part, you're not expected to understand them. Apart from the obvious ones like choosing a different keyboard layout or choosing between doing an installation, a rescue or a memory test, most options are intended for poorly-supported hardware or highly unusual requirements. If an option isn't listed on that BootOptions page, the expected workflow is to try booting, find that it doesn't work, enlist the help of Google or a guru to diagnose the problem, and learn that the problem can be worked around by adding the more_magic=xyzzy option.\n\nA: *\n\n*F1: It is obvious: It shows some help.\n\n*F2: Here you can enter your native language.

Early screenshots of Unity showed web applications on the launcher that would get launched in the browser.\n\nI heavily use Chrome's \"appmode\", which makes .desktop files of web applications and runs them as a seperate application. I would like to put these applications on my launcher so that when I click on it it launches gmail in a separate window, like a separate application from my browser. \nAm I missing something? Launching the application from the .desktop file from the file manager just opens it my existing browser.\n\nA: Ken's answer complicates the subject a bit, I think.\nUnity has a switch, -b, I think, that allows that. like unity -b http://mail.google.com\nI'm not sure if it's really -b, so you better check with unity --help.\n\nA: Only way I know right now is with gconf.

Which is probably better for a new machine running Ubuntu?\n\nA: In terms of hardware, I think at this moment ATI is providing more bang for your buck, with many cheap cards outperforming NVIDIA cards of the same value.\nHowever, while ATI's open-source drivers are continuing to improve, I don't think they (nor the binary fglrx driver) compare with NVIDIA's proprietary driver -- yet. If you're using a typical desktop/office machine, you may be okay with a nice ATI card and either set of drivers. However, if you plan on doing any gaming, I think you may have less of a hassle using NVIDIA. So, at this point in time, I'd say an NVIDIA video card may be your best bet purely because of the drivers.\nI have an NVIDIA GTS 250 and it's been running without issue, except for a text rendering bug in 10.10 (which is still beta) which has already been fixed in a newer driver.\n\nA: The scenario has changed in Ubuntu 16.04 ;-)\nIf you were using the AMD Catalyst (fglrx) driver on older Ubuntu you may wish to avoid upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04.\nThe ‘Xenial Xerus’ does not support the widely used proprietary graphics driver for AMD/ATI graphics cards.\nInstead, Ubuntu \"recommends using open source alternatives (radeon and amdgpu)\", and say \"AMD put a lot of work into the drivers, and we back ported kernel code from Linux 4.5 to provide a better experience.\"\nMore details:\n\n*\n\n*OMG! Ubuntu!: Why Radeon Users May Want to Avoid Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\nIf you already have an AMD graphics, Don't panic! You will definitely find a lot of workarounds and fixes. But if you are planning to buy a new laptop fully supported by Ubuntu, best bet is to go with nvidia graphics.\n\nA: After an entire year with this card, I will not be using ATI in the future. Both the proprietary and open source drivers have serious, albeit very different, issues. In fact, the experience has been so frustrating that I will make an effort to never use hardware that needs restricted drivers ever again.\n\nA: Certain nVidia cards have no Free Software Driver (edit to add: Nouveau doesn't support all nvidia cards). When a security upgrade to Xorg breaks ABI compatibility and therefore breaks your driver, you're stuck on SVGA...well, that's if you're lucky.\nWith the AMD/ATi driver you have a Free Software Driver that is upgraded when Xorg is upgraded. It is not dependent upon the manufacturer to support it, even if you choose to use the proprietary driver.\n", "Q: How do I load ecb at emacs start up?

All you need to do is enable the features you want. This has to be done on a per-user basis so as not to annoy the users who don't want those features. In the case of ecb, if you want it active all the time, call (ecb-activate) in your .emacs. If you want a more complex set up, read the “Installation and first steps” chapter in the ecb manual, but skip the “Installation” section which the distribution has already done for you.\n", "Q: Which font formats can I use? I've learned that I can put .ttf font files in ~/.fonts to use them on Ubuntu.\nWhich other font formats can I use this way? I'm having trouble finding the right documentation.\n\nA: Font rendering in most applications is done by FreeType 2.\nSo mainly, you can use:\n\n\n*\n\n*TrueType\n\n*OpenType (with TrueType or PostScript CFF glyphs)\n\n*PostScript Type 1, Type2 (aka CFF) & Type 9 (CID-keyed Type 1)\n\n*a whole bunch of legacy bitmap font formats\n\n\nA: From the types that wiki page lists, I know that TrueType and OpenType should work fine. Certain bitmap and PostScript fonts might work, though googling around it seems you may not get anti-aliasing with those.\nFontForge fonts can't directly be used, but you can easily use FontForge to convert them. EOT and WOFF fonts can be used indirectly through the browser for the web, but not on the desktop. Other types you may simply have to try and see if they work.\n", "Q: Install a i386 printer driver into an amd64 distribution or how can I find a good printer based on features? I just bought a Lexmark Interpret S408 all-in-one printer. The box said that it supported Ubuntu 8.04, but I told myself it should work with Lucid... well no. The only driver I have found is for i386 while I have a amd64 image installed; the architecture is incompatible.\nSo, the quesiton is : Is it possible to install that driver anyway, somehow? Or do I need to take that printer back to the store and buy another one?\nIf the latter is the only alternative, I need a printer that \n\n\n*\n\n*has wireless connection capability\n\n*can do color printing\n\n*is of good price (less than $200 CAD)\n\n\nThank you for your answers, help, and tips.\n** UPDATE **\nThe driver was given in the form of deb package (for Debian distributions) and I managed to extract the actual deb package driver out of the install program. I ran\nsudo dpkg -i --force-all lexmark-inkjet-09-driver-1.5-1.i386.deb\n\nand the driver installed, and I was able to print something out. But that pretty much ends there; I cannot access anymore of the printer settings, etc. (i.g. scanner, fax, wifi settings, etc.) I should suffice for now as I'm satisfied with the printer's features (and size, and prince), but if I could have a full-linux-supported printer like that one, I would return this one in exchange for the other.\n\nA: It's better to look for hardware that's supported by drivers shipping with Linux distributions, than to select hardware because its manufacturer advertises Linux support. That's because hardware manufacturers aren't always very good at writing drivers, especially for non-Windows OSes. Beware especially of binary-only drivers: they're hard to integrate with anything but the particular distribution the driver maker tested their code with.\nFor printers, favor one that's on the Gutenprint supported list. Sometimes a newer model now available in stores hasn't made it into the list yet, but a slightly older model is supported and the driver works with the newer model. Postscript printers (rare in your price range) are always ok. Otherwise, beware; Google to see if other people have gotten it to work before buying.\nThe Gutenprint compatibility list is short on Lexmark models. You can still try to print and see what happens, and search or ask on the Gutenprint lists to see what people think of your model. If it's definitely not supported by Gutenprint, install the i386 driver, even if you have an amd64 installation: amd64 kernels can run 32-bit programs, and the libraries a driver is likely to use are in the ia32-libs package.\n", "Q: moving from Fedora 12 to Ubuntu 10.04 I recently moved from using Fedora to Ubuntu.\nThe reason I was using Fedora in the first place was that I was using Redhat at work. Now I am trying out Ubuntu and will finally settle for one (update to Fedora13 or use Ubuntu) in a couple of days.\n\nWhat should I expect different here? What is awesome and what is missing?\n\nA: I did a presentation on the differences between the Red Hat Way and the Debian Way at Ohio LinuxFest last year.

Other than that I like the package management and its desktop friendly approach. I haven't used fedora that much to tell the difference other than the fact that apache2 is named httpd in red hat machines:).

I  would just like to know the reason.\n\nA: You can run multiple instances of Synaptic. But only one of them can have administrative access. That's to prevent simultaneous modifications of the package databases, which could easily lead to them being corrupted.\nYou can run any number of instances of Synaptic with read-only access by typing synaptic at a command prompt.\n\nA: Basically: Synaptic is working at very low level for installing/configuring software. Having two instances working at the same time, changing settings and stuff, would most probably lead to corrupted software, with unusable features - and if it is about system software, it could render your OS unusable.\nThen Synaptic just can't be launched twice at the same time, to prevent such problems.\nYou could see it as a \"security feature\" ;-)\n\nA: Synaptic is just a graphical front-end to APT (Debian's package manager: Advanced Packaging Tool).\nAPT automatically locks one of a few special files (/var/lib/dpkg/lock among others) as it runs any operation. It is theoretically possible to programme APT to allow for concurrent processes to modify the package database. However, in practise, it is difficult to do so without risking corruption. Since most users don't need to use the packaging tool in this way, the developers have decided to disallow concurrency by implementing a lock.\nIf you want to install several packages at once, you can do this by ticking all of those packages in Synaptic, or listing them on the command-line, like this:\nsudo apt-get install package1 package2 package3\n", "Q: Cannot list Home folder All of a sudden I can't access my home folder.

It seems I can't even delete as root.\n\nA: Hey. assuming so, but you did chown -R to make sure you hit all the other files?\ncheck permissions on whatever file you can't access (assuming you can see it at all?)\nAre you just not able to view anything in the folder at all, or what?\nsudo ls -la /home/solomon/ and maybe you'll see what's up.\n\nA: It might be caused by a problematic symbolic link. I had a broken symbolic link in ~ pointing at a remote network directory. Removing it did help.\nOther broken symbolic links in ~ pointing at /media/<whatever> are not causing any issues though.\n", "Q: How to make a keyboard layout permanent I'm currently working on a Ubuntu machine that has been set up by a user using a German keyboard layout. I prefer another one and changed it using the \"Keyboard\" dialog (I even deleted the old one).\nHowever after each reboot those changes are gone. The German layout has reappeared and is (again) the default one.\nHow can I make those changes permanent?\n\nA: Have you clicked System->Preferences->Keyboard->Layouts->Apply System-Wide?\nI seem to remember you may need to switch layout on the login screen one more time after that before it sticks.\n\nA: Yes this worked for me on my Mint 17.2 installation\nI was getting a backslash for hash key etc\nThe standard default layout was set for English (US)\nand I removed this and added just ENGLISH\n", "Q: How can I find duplicate songs? The title says it all. How can I detect duplicates in my media library?\n\nA: You can use fdupes for that:\n$ fdupes -r ~/Music\n\nwhich gives you a list of all duplicate files.\nYou can easily install it with \nsudo apt-get install fdupes\n\n\nA: I ran into a similar issue when I had a bunch of duplicate image files.  In my case, I just used md5sum on the files and sorted the results:\nfor file in $(find $rootdir -name \"*.jpg\"); do echo $(md5sum $file); done | sort\n\nFiles with the same contents generated the same hash, so duplicates could be found easily.  I manually deleted the dupes from there, although I could have extended the script to delete all but the first occurrence, but I'm always paranoid about doing that in an ad-hoc script.  \nNote that this only works for duplicate files with identical contents.  \n\nA: It might be a dozen years late, but I just wrote a command-line program that tries to detect similar audio files by comparing acoustic fingerprints: https://github.com/derat/soundalike\nIt uses the fpcalc utility from Chromaprint to generate the fingerprints, and then builds a lookup table to find possible matches before comparing fingerprints more rigorously.\n\nA: dupeGuru Music Edition is what you want. Set the scan type to \"Audio Contents\" in Preferences. Please note that the program is fairware so please contribute if you can.\n\nI suggest you couple this with MusicBrainz Picard which can tag your music files automatically.\n\n\nA: There is a plugin that was made some time ago for this. I've used it recently but it still leaves a little to be desired. There is a \"PPA\" for it - but no built packages yet, just the Bazaar branch. The install instructions go something like this:\nwget http://scrawl.bplaced.net/duplicate-source.tar.gz -O tmp.tar.gz && mkdir -vp ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/duplicate-source/ && tar -xf tmp.tar.gz -C ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins && rm -v tmp.tar.gz\n\nIf you're interested in using the Bazaar'd source code do the following instead:\nmkdir -vp ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins && cd ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins && bzr branch lp:rb-duplicate-source duplicate-source\n\nOnce it's installed restart Rhythmbox and you should have a Duplicates Finder now in the plugin list.\n\nAfter activating it - there are additional configuration options available.\n\nAfter the plugin is enabled - and when it finds duplicates - it'll add an additional option to your library list:\n\nA few settings that I've found as \"odd\" - I've tried this on a media library with over 120,000 songs (over 1,000 duplicates) and a library with about 1,000 songs and maybe 30 duplicates. On the former it took a VERY long time and crashed Rhythmbox several times during the search. I eventually went with Automatically \"Remove from Library\" to avoid having to rebuild the list. On smaller libraries everything works great though.\nWhen a duplicate is found - if you have the default options selected - the lower quality version of the song will be added to the list. So it's safe to select all songs on the Duplicates list and \"Remove\" (Either delete from disk or remove from library).\n\nA: Try FSlint or dupe gredtter\nTo install FSlint type in terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T)\nsudo apt-get install fslint\n\nhope this is useful..\n\nA: I've used FSlint to find duplicate files in general. FSlint is \"a utility to find and clean various forms of lint on a filesystem.\"\n", "Q: How can I change the order of the users in the login screen? I have several user accounts on a machine my mother uses most of the time. How can I sort the users so that her account shows up first in the list?\n\nA: I had the same problem, so I did an inquiry:\ngdm simple greeter uses ConsoleKit for obtaining the list of users. you can check the list (in the gdm order) by running:\n$ ck-history --frequent --seat='Seat1'\nuser1    148\nuser2    145\ngdm      143\n\nif 'Seat1' is not working, enter seat values from 'ck-list-sessions'.\nI do not know of a way to hand edit the ck-history list, but you can easily increase the frequency number for a logged in user e.g. by running (when user2 is logged in):\n$ for n in `seq 1 10`; do echo exit|ck-launch-session; done\n\nthe numbers will change to\n$ ck-history --frequent --seat='Seat1'\nuser2    155\nuser1    148\ngdm      143\n\nand the login screen user list will be reordered in the same way.\n\nA: The login screen doesn't simply sort by name. In fact, in lucid, the default login screen sorts first by usage frequency, and by display name as a fallback. So your mother will show up first after a few times.\n\nA: In response to both Gilles and Arancaytar's solutions: they might both be right. I had the same problem as Arancaytar. The account I logged into most frequently was strangely at the bottom of the list. But after reading Gilles solution, I tried logging in not by clicking on my name in the user list, but by clicking on \"Others\", manually typing my username, and then my password. After that I logged out to check, and my name was on the top of the user list. It seems like the login screen, for some strange reason, only records the frequency of logins when you manually enter your username. I haven't confirmed this definitely though.\nIn short, for those still having problems, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out.\n\n*Don't log in by clicking your name in the list.\n\n*Click on \"Others\" instead.\n\n*Log in by manually entering your username.\n\n*Log out to check if your name is now on top of the list.\n\n*If not, repeat step 4 a few more times, and hopefully it'll work.\n\n\nComment to say if this is successful for anyone else who still has problems!\n", "Q: Stop using flash? Or improve the flash experience? I'd like to setup my Ubuntu to work without Flash (= not installed), but still be able to view videos on sites like Youtube, wisevid, etc.   I want to try this because recently Flash has crashed a couple times. It also often 'feels' sluggish. Also a couple other flash related questions here got me thinking there might be a better way of doing things.   So how should i do this?     Note: Answers that have flash + work-arounds are also welcome. \n\nA: If you want to avoid flash and still go ahead and watch YouTube videos, install LightSpark, an open-source implementation of the Flash Player that works well in Ubuntu. Just run the below commands in a terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal):\nsudo apt-get remove flashplugin-installer\n\nThe above commmand is to make sure you don't have flash installed. After that, to install lightspark, run the below commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:sssup/sssup-ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lightspark\n\nThen close and start your browser (Chromium/Firefox) again to begin using LightSpark\n\nA: For YouTube videos you can use minitube\nsudo apt-get install minitube\n\nMinitube is a YouTube desktop client.\nWith it you can watch YouTube videos in a new way: you type a keyword, Minitube gives you an endless video stream.\nMinitube is not about cloning the original YouTube web interface, it aims to create a new TV-like experience. \nMinitube does not use the Flash Player. \nhttp://flavio.tordini.org/minitube\n\nA: There is no need to install any extra software like minitube.

There are some programs that can help to do this. The following are available from the software repositories:\n\n\n*\n\n*youtube-dl (command line) - downloads videos from youtube\n\n*clive (command line) - downloads videos from a number of websites\n\n*cclive (command line) - a C++ rewrite of clive\n\n*abby (graphical) - A GUI frontend to clive or cclive\n\n\nNot all video websites are supported but for some that aren't you may be able to find the URL of the video that is streaming and download it using wget or a GUI downloader such as d4x. Finding the video URL will require looking at the HTML code. To do this in chromium, you can right click next to the video and click 'inspect element'. You will be able to find the video URL within <embed></embed> tags. It will typically have a .flv or .avi extension. This will only work for websites that do not encrypt the URL (like youtube and megavideo do).\nYou can 'stream' a video (play it while it is downloading) by opening VLC and using Media->Open File... and locating the video or running vlc FILE in a terminal.\nThere are also browser extensions available, such as this one for firefox.\n\nA: youtube-dl was already mentioned as an very convenient and open-source alternative to a flash-plugin. Other examples of site-specific flash substitute programs are:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPlayer - for various BBC televesion and radio programs\n\n*Mediathek - for various german public television websites\n\n*arte-dl - for the French/German public television chanel\n\nA: The GUI downloader I use is DonwloadHelper  http://www.downloadhelper.net/ \nWorks great for me (Ubuntu 10.4 AMD64 and Firefox).\nFlash has been crashing for me lately as well (or so Firefox Tells me), but it still running anyway, just close the notification bar with the little \"x\". If you run Yahoo in a tab, then close that tab, that seems to eventually bring Firefox to a crawl. I stopped using Yahoo and switched to Gmail (plus my other e-mails like hotmail)...\nVortex\n\nA: I think you can use greasemonkey userscripts for this. Here are some examples. \none\ntwo\nthree\nFor downloading here is an app\n\nA: Install flash anyway... but only for the videos to \"load\" on the page... then, go to /tmp/ and for a video (hint: search for a video preview), and open the downloaded video in VLC for example :P\nYou may want too add a \"flash blocker\" to your browser to prevent load flash objects unwanted...\n\nA: For what it's worth, since installing the new ‘preview release’ of Flash Player 10.2 I've not had a single crash (which is a great improvement; previously Flash has been wicked unstable for me on both Linux and Windows).\nI couple this with FlashBlock (for Firefox, though there is a similar add-on with the same name for Chrome) to avoid unwanted Flash ads, Flash-storage user-tracking and exploits.\n\nA: My preferred way is to use this script that takes the Flash video and opens it automatically with your favorite media player (Gnome MPlayer, VLC, etc.). \nMake sure that you have zsh installed: \napt-get install zsh\n\nThen in /usr/local/bin/ create an executable play-flash file containing the following script: \n#!/bin/zsh\n\n VIDEOS=($(find /proc/*/fd -lname \"/tmp/Flash*\" 2> /dev/null))\n\n if [[ $#VIDEOS == 0 ]]; then\n        echo \"No videos found\"\n        exit 0\n fi\n\n if [[ $#VIDEOS == 1 ]]; then\n        echo \"Playing unique video available\"\n        gnome-mplayer --controlid=1 $VIDEOS\n        exit 1\n fi\n\n IFS=$'\\n' VIDEOS_LS=($(ls -1lHh $VIDEOS))\n select CHOICE in $VIDEOS_LS; do\n        if test $REPLY -ge 0 2>/dev/null ; then # just test for integer argument\n                gnome-mplayer --controlid=1 $VIDEOS[$REPLY]\n        elif [[ $REPLY[1] == c ]]; then\n                VIDEO=$VIDEOS[$REPLY[2,-1]]\n                if read \"NAME?Name? \"; then\n                        if [[ -z $NAME ]]; then\n                                NAME=$(ls -l $VIDEO | grep --only-matching \"Flash[^ ]*\")\n                        fi\n                        echo \"cp $VIDEO ~/\\\"$NAME.flv\\\"\"\n                        cp -i $VIDEO ~/\"$NAME.flv\"\n                fi\n        fi\n done\n\nIf you're using Xfce (but it should be similar for other DEs), now you can create a panel launcher that executes this script. But do make sure that the launcher has enabled the Run in terminal option: \n\nEvery time you load a Flash video in your browser and pause it, and then hit the panel launcher, you will either have the video played or you will have a selection of currently loaded flash videos to choose from. I've used this solution for years and it works very well. (Sometimes it doesn't work as expected on Youtube, but it works most of the times with most other websites.) It improves the flash experience, and reduces the number of CPU cycles and the temp of the laptop. Once the downloading of the .flv file is complete, you can easily save a copy from within the media player.\n\nA: If you only like to watch the youtube videos, you can with vlc. Only thing you need to copy the youtube URL and paste to the VLC main window and hit Play (enter). You also can drag and drop the URL from the browser to the vlc main window with mouse or touchpad. It even easier.\n\nA: At jan-2012, you may solved the problems. \nBut, one must have in mind that Ubuntu does not upgrade software to a newer version than that in the release.\nIf you have ubuntu 10.04 you can enter getdeb in the repositories, by this way you can upgrade to the last version of programs, although not from the ubuntu official site.\nBy now I have FireFox 9.0.1, it works very fine. I can see videos from many sites, including youtube of course.\n64bit processors are not new at 2010, many computers manufactured by 2006 have one of those.\nLinux does not have problem to address 4GB of ram, but windows does, for that reason the manufacturers more recently sell their computers with 64bit windows versions, being 64bit every time more common, for that reason the absence of 64bit plugins is disappearing. Not so the monopolistic imposition of the monopoly's OS. \nFirefox 9 is also working very well under w7-64. \n", "Q: Create a special version for rebuilt package I've recently recompiled suPHP from the apt-get source to include several commandline options. After building the pacakge it remains at version 0.7.1-1 and aptitude keeps trying to install over the custom one I've built. How can I update the version to reflect something like 0.7.1-1-marco0 - or something similar to that (like how Ubuntu will occasionally place ubuntu0 or ubuntu1 to a version to indicated an edit to the upstream's source)\n\nA: Run dch -i in the source directory to add a new changelog entry. If you update the version line to something like 0.7.1-1ubuntu0+marco1 (the key being the +) it'll sort as being newer than 0.7.1-1 but still older than 0.7.1-1ubuntu1 when Ubuntu releases a security update (since missing security updates is bad)\nIf you really want to not get security updates for it, you can lock the version of the package with sudo aptitude hold suphp\n", "Q: How do I get my machine to boot with a Grub: out of disk error? I have over the last week installed four differing versions of Ubuntu, 8.04, 8.10, 9.10 and 10.04, all fail with similar error messages from Grub on booting or rebooting. The message is Error: out of disk or similar on the older versions.\nThis is NOT the standard failure that is solved by deleting a couple of lines from the Grub config file, as discussed on the Ubuntu Forums, and it is not possible to reboot into the installation from the live cd. However the machine does boot the live cd.\nMy suspicions are that there is an incompatibility between the specific BIOS on my machine and GRUB. The machine is an old AMD based system with a small amount of memory.\nThe machine was running Ubuntu 8 without issues before this process started.\nI have since discovered that partitioning the disk with a small boot area of say 200MB allows Ubuntu to boot. However, Grub 2 is still displaying the error during the boot process.\n\nA: At last a solution.\nThe solution suggested Jacques Botha did not work -- the Live CD ignores the added instruction to align the disk.\nHowever, buried in the base of the launchpad bug trail is a suggestion to use partitioning software to generate the partition and align it manually before doing the installation. So my solution was to boot the Live CD and use gparted to make the partition and set it to be ext3.\nThis done, I booted from the CD and used text based installation but did not allow it to repartition the disk. Thus it has now installed Ubuntu 10.04 into an ext3 (not ext4) disk system. Thus I am not certain if the problem was ext4 or the disk partitioning but the system is up and running.\nA point for the Ubuntu dev team: I think the Live CD has now gotten so heavy that a “lightweight graphical system” or a “textual live boot” is required for older machines and some servers. Even eliminating the eye candy would make such a difference as machines like mine only just run the full eye watering system.\n\nA: Partition alignment changes may break some systems\nBy default, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS aligns partitions on disk to 1 MiB (1048576 bytes) boundaries. This ensures maximum performance on many modern disks, particularly solid state drives but also new \"Advanced Format\" disks with physical sectors larger than the traditional 512 bytes. Very few systems nowadays need the old alignment, used in the days of MS-DOS when it was useful for partitions to start at the beginning of a cylinder.\nIn some rare cases, optimal alignment may cause problems. Some BIOS implementations (those on Asus P5P800-MX and Asus P5GZ-MX motherboards) have been reported to hang after installation. It may be difficult to install Microsoft Windows XP and older after installing Ubuntu, although more recent versions of Windows should be compatible with optimal alignment and indeed may produce it themselves. If you find that you need to use the old cylinder alignment instead, then add the partman/alignment=cylinder boot parameter when starting the installer\n\nA: In many older machines the motherboard/BIOS supports a limited quantity of hard drive space. For example my mx6030 only supports 113 GB or so, but Ubuntu shows the full 320 GB of the hard drive. You can try limiting the partitions you make to the size your motherboard/BIOS supports.\nAnother thing you can try is installing boot files to your root partition (/) during installation, when Ubuntu asks you to choose a location.\n", "Q: Is there a CIL (Mono) library for using the Messaging Menu?

I've connected a HDTV with HDMI on my Radeon 4670, using the open source ati driver. However there is \"overscan\" which cuts off a bit of each edge of the screen, about the size of the gnome-panel. How can I fix this so it displays the full resolution?\n\nA: The issue was with the TV, not Ubuntu. \n\n\n*\n\n*Samsung TV - go to Menu / Picture / Picture Options / Size / Screen Fit (instead of 16:9).\n\n*LG TV - go to Settings / Picture / Aspect Ratio / Just Scan (instead of 16:9)\n\n*Sony TV - hit Home button, go to Settings / Screen / Display Area / Full Pixel\n\n*Sharp TV - hit View Mode button, select \"Dot by Dot\" or \"Full screen\"\n\n\nA: I'd suggest checking your graphics card driver software, I know ATI comes with overscan options. In windows there was a program called power strip that I used to fix this on mine with Windows 7.\n\nA: I Have struggled with this problem for longer than I care to say! This may help if you have a NVidia graphics card, and Ubuntu 14.04. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Ubuntu software center, search for NVidia drivers and\ndownload \"Nvidia X Server Settings\".\n\n*Once downloaded, click on the Nvidia icon, and select x server\ndisplay configuration.\n\n*Once there, simply slide the underscan slider until the desired size\nis achieved.\n\nA: Both right,\nNew TVs are set to allow overscan, so the driver will often do that very overscan that is available when set to a desktop resolution.\nSo, the driver for the video card - might - have an overscan setting to resolve this if lucky, or as Hew found out you might be able to set the TV to display the incoming signal without overscan.\nTry the video display driver first, then if no luck, try your TV settings.  It is best to correct in the driver setting first, instead of setting a fixed display.\n\nA: As the above comments are saying, the problem is most likely due to the TV and not the driver. \nHowever, if you have a Sharp Aquos TV, \"Dot by Dot\" mode might not be available in the menu as Pakman mentioned; I couldn't find an option for enabling \"Dot by Dot\" mode anywhere.\nInstead, I solved the problem by discovering that my remote has a dedicated \"Wide Mode\" button for this setting, which looks kind of like this: |<>|.

A Sharp TV would not let me change selection from \"stretch\" to \"dot by dot\". It gave me a message:\nNo input selection available\n\nA solution that served my purposes (not losing part of the screen) was to switch to the lower resolution of 1360 x 768 instead of 1920 x 1080.\nSince I just wanted to run emacs on the TV, losing some resolution was not a big deal. \nThis is kindof a dumb workaround, but since no-one else seems to mention it, I figured this answer would contribute.\n\nA: In my case, activating overscan on the monitor (a Philips 244E) didn't fully solve the problem (the monitor's space was not fully covered).

One of them is a Windows 2008 server and it allows me to assign multiple IP's to one card if I use static IP's.  Is there a way to do this if it is using DHCP? \nLooking at http://linux.die.net/man/5/dhcpd.conf I don't think it is, at least the attempt I had didn't work.  As I understand it the following would just choose the best IP and assign it that one, rather than all of them:\nhost mymachine {\n    hardware ethernet 00:00:00:00:00:00;\n    fixed address 192.168.10.96, 192.168.10.97;\n}\n\nEDIT\neverything I have read would suggest this is not possible. Hope someone can prove me wrong, or show an alternative way of dealing with this so that all IP's are dealt with at a central location and machines can have more than one IP (dev and web servers).\n\nA: Do you really need to give out multiple IPs for devices to get traffic routed to them using iptables? For webservers, it may be easier to use a single IP and different ports, or just use virtual hosts in Apache, for example.\nIt doesn't appear to me as if giving multiple IPs to an interface using DHCP is really possible. at least the manual for dhcpd.conf doesn't mention it is:\nThe fixed-address declaration is used to assign one or more fixed IP addresses to a client. It should only appear in a host declaration. If more than one address is supplied, then when the client boots, it will be assigned the address that corresponds to the network on which it is booting. If none of the addresses in the fixed-address statement are valid for the network to which the client is connected, that client will not match the host declaration containing that fixed-address declaration. Each address in the fixed-address declaration should be either an IP address or a domain name that resolves to one or more IP addresses.\nWhich means you can put more than one address, but they need to be in different subnets (according to the subnet configuration in dhcpd as well). FWIW, I don't recall seeing a DHCP client which supports giving out more than one IP for an interface... that's even if other applications like NetworkManager supports it.\n", "Q: How do I block people with Empathy I'm trying to block a user from contacting me, but can't seem to do this from the Empathy interface.

There are several issues when we switch from one user to another, such as the NetworkManager icon being present only on the first account (which is ridiculous).\nA similar problem occurs when there is a DVD in the drive. When a second user logs in, the DVD cannot be seen (unmounted, ejected) until you physically eject the disk (i.e. press the button on the drive itself) and reinsert it.\nMy amateurish guess tells me that automount mounts the disk with the current user's permissions[citation needed] so the other can't unmount it. This is a bit absurd since every user has the \"Mount user-space filesystems (FUSE)\" and \"Use CD-ROM drives\" permissions (I am the only sudoer, though).\nIs there any way this could be \"fixed\"? It's only a nuisance, but I can already see my co-users asking questions and being annoyed.. :)\n\nA: First I have no solution only a workaround guess...\nIf you often use the same DVD try to copy these files in local folders or create an ISO-file and set up the right group permissions... \nAdditionally you can deactivate automount (option no-auto in /etc/fstab) and mount the dvd by yourself via command line.

Displaying a notice on first run asking each user if they want to use the previous default instead would be nice.\n(Is it even possible to add a new entry in that dialog?)\n\nA: I will go for a configuration dialog in the app, plus a command line script.\nBoth should read the previous keyboard shortcut value, store it and restore it when the user asks (or delete the value if no one was present).\nThe dialog should let final users adjust the behaviour. The command line script can be used by packagers to set the default behaviour according to distribution guidelines, and to make it uninstall clean (restoring the keyboard shortcuts that it grabbed).\n\nA: \nunconditionally overrides any existing setup you have for PrtSc, which might be annoying\n\nIt would. As others have said, I'd make this an option somewhere prominent in the preferences, perhaps a first-run choice-dialogue too.\nBut importantly, I would have it remember the setting it was changing from and store that somewhere. On uninstallation, I'd have it go through all the users and if enabled reset their print-screen keybind to whatever it was before.\nThe complicated bit is the post-rm script will run as root and you need to run commands as all the desktop users.

Is it possible to switch into a Windows environment from Ubuntu without rebooting the computer?\n\nA: Using a \"Bare Metal\" hypervisor for virtual machines (such as VMware) may allow you to do this. There is a cost in resources of course. This is not the sort of VM where one OS is the host and another a guest ... both are equal, and run under a thin low-level hypervisor.\n\nA: Run one operating system as a guest in a virtual machine, with the other system as a host. (You can also run both as guests inside a hypervisor.)\nIf you want good integration between Windows and Linux, and don't mind running Windows as the primary operating system, you can run coLinux, which is a virtualized Linux running on top of Windows. There is an Ubuntu-based distribution of coLinux: andLinux.\n\nA: No, not with a dual boot setup. The only way to come close to this is to install Windows in a virtual machine using software such as Virtualbox. Virtualbox can be installed from the Ubuntu Software Centre (just search 'virtualbox').\n\nA: You will need to go for the newest hybrid laptops. \n\n....Lenovo's new dual CPU, dual-OS ThinkPad X1 Hybrid is perhaps the\n  most fully realized attempt yet to give users Linux and Windows in a\n  well-designed portable machine. Lenovo's laptop, which will be shown\n  at the Consumer Electronic Show next week, can switch between Linux\n  and Windows with one click, and runs Linux on a dual-core Qualcomm\n  chip....\n\nNews source \n\nA: Not as I think you mean. The only way to go from a proper \"bare metal\" install of Ubuntu to a \"bare metal\" install of Windows is through BIOS.\nHowever, virtualisation might be an option (it is for me). I only have a few Windows applications that I occasionally need for work (Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks) that don't work acceptably with with Wine. I use VirtualBox to boot a \"virtual\" install of Windows. Note this requires quite a powerful machine with plenty of RAM to run really well.\nWine is another option. Wine allows you to run some Windows applications on Ubuntu but the coverage is a lot lower for most applications than a virtualised environment.\nIf you explain what you're trying to do in Windows, perhaps we can explain the best of those solutions.\n\nA: If you just need to run some windows applications, you might try using wine.\nJust do\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nand when install is finished, you just download some program for windows and go to file properties -> Permissions -> mark Allow executing this file as program.\nThen you just normally double click on that exe file.\nMany programs work pretty good with wine.\n\nA: No, because each operating system is different. If you needed to install inside of a Virtual Machine and run an operating system inside another.\n\nA: I know I'm a little over a decade late for the party here but maybe this will help somebody else looking to do this now.\nI know exactly what you want to do and why you want to do it. Virtual machines suck sadily, this ability is not possible on one motherboard.\n(Unless you want to write your own BIOS to split cores for each set of BIOS and assign ram to different split cores. Probably easier to modify BIOS on a dual processor motherboard. That's way out of my pay grade.)\nGet yourself two identical computers. Install Windows on one, and Linux on the other (or you're operating system of choice, maybe you prefer IBM's 0S/2.) Buy a monitor switchboard then the other operating system is a simple as \"control+Alt+F1\". Saves you time, keeps you more productive, show off to your friends. Saves you desk space, Gives you the ability to not need multiple monitors, keyboard, and mouse setups just to run two computers. Some affordable switchboards are capable of hosting upto 16 different PCs.\n", "Q: How do I use REISUB with an Apple slim aluminum keyboard? I'm using the Apple slim aluminum keyboard, which doesn't have the SysRq key:\n\nWhat key(s) should I press for the magic SysRq key when I need to type REISUB?\n\nA: This answer also posted here.\nAfter 3 or 4 hrs of hard searching, reading, and trial and error, here's a more thorough and generic answer which should work for any Apple/Mac laptop or keyboard, not just the \"Apple slim aluminum keyboard.\" In my particular case, however, I'm using this solution for a 2008 MacBook white running Xubuntu 16.04 LTS.\nMany thanks to Bengt Olsson for his excellent instructions here which gave me the necessary start to figure out the missing details.\nThis solution is done in the user space, and does NOT require recompiling the kernel like some suggestions.\n\n*\n\n*Download source for keyfuzz, and extract it (I can right-click it and go to \"Extract Here\" to extract it in my GUI file manager, for instance). To read more about keyfuzz, see here. It is released under the GNU GPL 2.0 or later open source license (yaaay open source!).\n\n*\n\n*Dont' use a directory too deep (or with spaces possibly) or else the ./configure command below will fail.\n\n\n\n*Install dependencies, or else running ./configure below may spit out some errors:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lynx xmltoman gengetopt\n\n\n\n*Compile and install keyfuzz with the usual commands:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\n\n*Navigate to /dev/input/by-id and find your Apple keyboard that ends in -event-kbd:\ncd /dev/input/by-id\nls\n\nFor me it's:\n\nusb-Apple_Computer_Apple_Internal_Keyboard___Trackpad-event-kbd\n\n\n\n\n*Add the following line to your /etc/rc.local file, to cause this command to run each time your computer boots up and loads this user. Notice we are using the Apple keyboard entry we just found above. This command uses keyfuzz to map F12 or F13 on your Apple keyboard or laptop to the system \"Magic SysRq key\", for soft reboots.\n\n*\n\n*To map F12 to SysRq: 458821 99. Many thanks to \"pjjjv\" for figuring that out here!\n\n*To map F13 to SysRq: 458856 99.\n\n*Since my MacBook 2008 does not have F13, I am using the F12 option above. Also remember to use your proper keyboard entry we found above. The command I added to rc.local for my case is:\necho \"458821 99\" | keyfuzz -s -d /dev/input/by-id/usb-Apple_Computer_Apple_Internal_Keyboard___Trackpad-event-kbd\n\n\n\n*Here is my entire /etc/rc.local file, with the appropriate entry:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.   \n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\necho \"458821 99\" | keyfuzz -s -d /dev/input/by-id/usb-Apple_Computer_Apple_Internal_Keyboard___Trackpad-event-kbd\n\nexit 0\n\n\n\n\n\n*Reboot.\nNow I can press Alt+F12 (or you can use Alt+F13 as described above) and issue REISUB to soft-reboot your computer. Works perfectly on my MacBook 2008 laptop running Xubuntu 16.04 LTS.\nNote that you can see the results returned by issuing REISUB as you press each key by first jumping to an alternate session with Ctrl+Alt+F1 (F1 through F6 work actually) before issuing the command. To get back to your main X Window session use Ctrl+Alt+F7.\nIf you get a result that says\n\nThis sysrq operation is disabled\n\n\nthat's normal for several of the commands, as they pose a potential security risk. The Boot one should still work, however, allowing you to soft-reboot your computer. Here is some more information on this, from mniess here:\n\nStarting with Ubuntu 12.10 a more fine-grained control of which Magic- SysRq features are enabled is possible. Just edit the file /etc/sysctl.d/10-magic-sysrq.conf.\n\n\nThe file is well documented and tells you exactly how to enable which features. The current default was picked for security purposes and should only be changed if you know why you need to (for security implications see bug #194676).\n\n\nA: Just did this. If you don't want to recompile the kernel like suggested in the first link of the first answer, there is a simpler way. It's kind of outlined in the second link of the first answer, but here is the actual procedure: \n\n\n*\n\n*Download source for keyfuzz\n\n*Compile and install with the usual commands\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\n*Add the following line to your /etc/rc.local file:\necho \"458856 99\" | sudo /usr/local/sbin/keyfuzz -s -d /dev/input/by-id/usb-Apple__Inc_Apple_Keyboard-event-kbd\n\nNow it should be possible to press Alt+F13 and issue REISUB.

If SysReq key works, you can kill processes one-by-one using Alt+SysReq+F. Kernel will kill the mostly «expensive» process each time. If you want to kill all processes for one console, you can issue Alt+SysReq+K.\nNOTE: You should explicitly enable these key combinations. Ubuntu ships with sysrq default setting 176 (128+32+16), which allows to run only SUB part of REISUB combination. You can change it to 1 (all commands enabled) or 244 which is potentially less harmful. To do this:\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/10-magic-sysrq.conf\n\nand switch 176 to 244; then\necho 244 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq\n\nIt will immediately work! You can test this by pressing Alt+SysReq+F. For me, it killed active browser tab, then all extensions. And if you will continue, you can reach X Server restart.\n\nMore info on all the Alt+SysReq functions here.\n\nA: Some other resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/Freeze\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/BlankScreen\n\nA: You might get some extra information when you switch to the TTY view.

You can have different sessions on most of the F-keys but that's different question altogether.\n\nA: The simplest solution is to add the \"Force Quit\" applet to your Gnome top panel and when a program doesn't respond, click on the force quit and then on the application.\nI am surprised with so many answers, this isn't mentioned. Of course, you can always do a ps -A and pipe that to grep for your program name. And kill -9 that. I prefer simplicity.\n\nA: My ubuntu is super prone to freezing (probably 20 odd times a day).\nI use the magic sysrq key too, but instead of using it to reboot or kill xserver, \nI use the 'f' command which calls oom_kill, effectively dropping a process.\nI've only ever seen this drop chrome tabs (as I tend to have quite a few heavyweight\nones open at a time).  Anyway, this get's me out of this mess 95% of the time.\nSo when my ubuntu freezes (locks up, mouse stops responding etc), I hold alt + sysrq and then hit f (if you don't do this correctly it will take a screenshot instead).  I usually have to repeat this combo a couple of times before ubuntu spurs back to life.\nI'd have given up on ubuntu a long time ago if I hadn't discovered this, hope it helps someone!\n\nA: When a single program stops working:\nWhen a program window stops responding, you can usually stop it by clicking the X-shaped close button at the top left of the window. That will generally result in a dialog box saying that the program is not responding (but you already knew that) and presenting you with the option to kill the program or to continue to wait for it to respond. \nSometimes this does not work as expected. If you can't close a window by normal means, you can hit Alt+F2, type xkill, and press Enter. Your mouse cursor will then turn into an X. Hover over the offending window and left-click to kill it. Right clicking will cancel and return your mouse to normal.\nIf your program is running from a terminal, on the other hand, you can usually halt it with Ctrl+C. If not, find the name and process ID of its command, and tell the program to end as soon as possible with kill [process ID here]. It sends the default signal SIGTERM (15). If all else fails, as a last resort send SIGKILL (9): kill -9 [process ID here]. Note that you should only use SIGKILL as a last resort, because the process will be terminated immediately by the kernel with no opportunity for cleanup. It does not even get the signal - it just stops to exist.  \n(Killing a process by kill -9 allways works if you have the permission to kill. In some special cases the process is still listed by ps or top (as \"zombie\") - in this case, the program was killed, but the process table entry is kept, becuse it's needed later.)\nWhen the mouse stops working:\nIf the keyboard still works, press Alt+F2 and run gnome-terminal (or, if these fail to launch, press Alt+Ctrl+F1 and login with your username and password). From there you can troubleshoot things. I'm not going to get into mouse troubleshooting here, as I haven't researched it. If you just want to try restarting the GUI, run sudo service lightdm restart. This should bring down the GUI, which will then attempt to respawn, bringing you back to the login screen.\nWhen you have an Intel Bay Trail CPU\nSee https://askubuntu.com/a/803649/225694.\nWhen everything, keys and mouse and all, stop working:\nFirst try the Magic SysReq method outlined in Phoenix' answer. If that doesn't work, press the Reset button on the computer case. If even that doesn't work, you'll just have to power-cycle the machine.\nMay you never reach this point.\n\nA: Freezes such as you have described can be both software and hardware related and as you have found sometimes frustratingly difficult to diagnose.\nHardware\nIf this is a desktop PC look at your hardware-cards. For both laptops and desktops possibly acpi type issues.\nIt might be useful to temporarily simplify your configuration to have just the graphics card connected with a standard keyboard and mouse.  All other cards should be removed. \nFor acpi related issues, try booting with noapic nomodeset in your grub boot option.  Its also worth trying acpi=off although this could have other undesirable effects such as constant fan usage.\nAlso worth checking the bios version level and seeing if the vendor has a newer bios version.  The readme notes should hopefully reveal if any newer version fixed crashes and freezes.\nSoftware\nI note you have tried the standard 270 drivers but have failed due to freezes.  Can you clarify if you had similar issues with the open-source driver?  Obviously you will not get Unity during testing this.\nGraphics freezing can be one of/or a combination of the driver/compiz/X/kernel\nIf you are willing to try any of the suggestions below first backup your system with a good backup tool such as CloneZilla. You  will need an external media device to receive the image such as a large USB stick/drive or separate internal hard-drive.\nInstalling newer nVidia driver\nDeactivate (uninstall) your current 173-nvidia driver using the Additional Drivers window.\nThere are a small number of important fixes primarily in the 275 stable but a small number also in the 280beta that fixed freezes - it is worth a shot to see if these apply to your graphics card. Unfortunately nvidia dont go into detail on which cards they specifically fix (readme.txt) \nHowever - I would strongly recommend a backup unless you feel confident on reversing a nvidia install - especially since you had serious issues with the slightly older 270 drivers. I've used clonezilla countless times and it has always got me out of trouble. You do need a large external drive though - USB stick/external drive or a separate drive.\nX Updates\nThe latest graphics drivers have been packaged in the x updates ppa.\nNote - this will lead you away from the standard baseline - if upgrading in the future ppa-purge the PPA itself before upgrading.\nYou can also manually install the drivers from nVidia:\nTry installing the latest nvidia stable 275 or 280 drivers - \n32bit 280 drivers: ftp site and 64bit: 280 drivers: ftp site\nTo Install\nCTRL + ALT + F1 to switch to TTY1 and login\nsudo service gdm stop\n\nTo stop the X server\nsudo su\n\nTo run as root\ncd ~/Downloads\nsh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-280.04.run\n\nTo install the 32bit driver (equiv for 64bit) then reboot.\nTo uninstall\nsudo sh NVIDIA* --uninstall\n\nAlso remove /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nX/Kernel/Compiz\nIf you run classic Ubuntu with effects do you get the same freeze issues as standard Ubuntu?  If you cannot reproduce the freeze with classic Ubuntu (no effects) then this will point you towards a compiz issue.  I would raise a launchpad bug report with the compiz team.\nIf space is available (e.g. 20Gb), you could dual boot/install alongside the latest oneiric alpha.  Obviously this will itself be unstable, but it will come with the latest X and Kernel. You may need to also install manually the beta 280 graphics drivers above since it probably will not be offered in the Additional Drivers window.\nIf during testing you dont see the same freeze activity you could try uplifting your X version with the x-edgers ppa and using kernel kernel 3.0 in Natty.  Going this route is not really desirable - and could cause you upgrade issues in the future - and may have other unforeseen stability issue.  Again, use ppa-purge to remove the PPA.\nKernel 3.0 is packaged with the PPA - you'll need to install the headers as well as the kernel itself from synaptic BEFORE rebooting if you intend to install the nvidia drive later.\nThis is a testing ppa - do have a ready backup if you want to try this route.\n\nA: Hit Alt+F2 to run a command. Type xkill and hit Enter.\nYour mouse cursor will transform into a cross that can force to close any window you click on.\nIf somebody can provide a screenshot, I think that would be useful.\n\nA: There were some missed bugs between the relation of Unity/Compiz, the X.org system and the Video driver. These bugs of course are dealt with with newer, updated versions of Unit, Compiz, X or the video Driver.\nWhen inside Unity and everything is slow and basically damaged, to go to TTY1, press CTRL+ALT+F1. When in the terminal, type your user and password to get to the prompt line. You can also get to the TTY when booting by pressing ESC or holding SHIFT, then on the GRUB menu, selecting recovery mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Xorg Edgers PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa sudo apt-get update\n\nDepending on your video card you can either install the 304 series, 310 Series, 313 Series or any newer one that appears there. I recommend always test the latest version and only if it throws a problem, then go down from there until you reach a version where everything works correctly. For example, if you have a GT 9500 or later (Like in my case to which I also have a 440 GT, 560 TI and 680 GTX) the only version that solves all my problems is the 313.18 that came out a couple of days ago. So I would do this:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-313\n\nThis would install the latest version of the 313 series. It fixes MANY video problems with compiz, unity and xorg. The 310 series also fixes many issues but have not tested that one with my video cards. The other Nvidia versions are nvidia-experimental-304 and nvidia-experimental-310 as of this writing.\n\n*Reboot to test if your video card not works correctly with Ubuntu. If you get any problems regarding Nvidia config file, simply open a terminal and type sudo nvidia-xconfig and reboot.\nThere are other nice questions that could also help like:\nHow can I update my NVIDIA driver?\nHow do I install the Nvidia drivers?\nCan not install Nvidia driver\nWhat's the difference between the nvidia-current, and nvidia-current-updates packages?  \nOr even one that is more generic: How to correctly enable Desktop Cube in Unity 3D?\n\nA: To debug the freeze, you can use Magic SysRq key, for example:\nNote: Consider holding ⇧ Shift  (depending on your keyboard).\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt-SysRq-9 (no ⇧ Shift) - Set the console log level to 9 to show more of kernel messages\n\n*Alt-SysRq-w - Display list of blocked (D state) tasks\n\n*Alt-SysRq-l - Shows a stack backtrace for all active CPUs.\n\n*Alt-SysRq-t - Output a list of current tasks and their information to the console\n\n*Alt-SysRq-p - Output the current registers and flags to the console\n\n*Alt-SysRq-q - Display all active high-resolution timers and clock sources.\n\n*Alt-SysRq-m - Output current memory information to the console\n\n\nOther things to try during freeze:\nNote: Consider holding ⇧ Shift (depending on your keyboard).\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the nice level of all high-priority and real-time tasks by hitting Alt-SysRq-n.\n\n*Try forcing a return to a text console try hitting Control-Alt-F1 (from F1 to F12).\n\n*Kill all processes on the current virtual console (can kill X) by hitting Alt-SysRq-k.\n\n*Perform a system crash (if it is configured) by Alt-SysRq-c.\n\n\nIf nothing works, you should perform a safe reboot by Alt-SysRq-REISUB, which is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt-SysRq-R: UnRaw (take control of keyboard back from X).\n\n*Alt-SysRq-E: tErminate (send SIGTERM to all processes).\n\n*Alt-SysRq-I: kIll (send SIGKILL to all processes, forcing them to terminate immediately).\n\n*Alt-SysRq-S: Sync all mounted filesystems (flush data to disk).\n\n*Alt-SysRq-U: Unmount (remount all filesystems in read-only mode),\n\n*Alt-SysRq-B: immediately reBoot the system.\nNote: If above hard reboot combination won't work, the freeze could be caused by defected hardware, not video drivers.\nIf you can't use Magic SysRq key, see also: Diagnosing and fixing apparently random Ubuntu crashes?\nAfter reboot, check your kern.log for details, especially call traces generated by above kernel commands. This can help to find the right bug report for it, and find the solution. Check the following kern.log example.\nYou can check the latest crash log by:\njournalctl -b -1 # Then hit Shift-G to jump to the end.\n\nTo list other journal logs, run:\njournalctl --list-boots\n\nSuggested solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade your Ubuntu and kernel to the latest version.\n\n*If problem repeats, the workaround is to install NVIDIA drivers, which replaces Nouveau video driver.\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu desktop hangs occasionally during regular use\n\n*How to fix non-responsive Ubuntu system?.\n\n\nA: If you're getting a lot of freezes, there might be something wrong with your hardware. I used to get hard lockups every 48 hours due to some less than optimal RAM. Memtest86+ showed the fault after 40 minutes of testing. Swapped the RAM out for some more (under warranty) and I'm now at 32 days, 1 hour of uptime.\nUbuntu doesn't tend to leak its guts all over your memory like Windows can over time. Even if one application or a poor X video driver does, you can restart LigthtDM very simply and just keep going and going and going. I've actually been through three beta versions of the nvidia driver in this one boot :)\nAnyway... While knowing how to restart softly is a very handy thing, finding, reporting and fixing the system should be your next priority. If it's an always-on system, you should easily be able to make it between kernel updates* without needing a restart.\n*You should restart when you get kernel updates as they'll be security fixes that won't be applied until you reboot into the newer kernel.\n\nA: When everything stops working, first try Ctrl + Alt + F1 to go to a terminal, where you can likely kill X or other problem processes.\nIf even that doesn't work, try using holding down Alt + SysReq while pressing (slowly, with a few seconds between each) R E I S U B.\nThis puts the keyboard in raw mode, ends tasks in various states, syncs the disks, etc, and finally reboots the machine. \nYou will get much better results doing this than just pulling the plug. Of course, if this fails, you're pretty much left with pulling the plug.\n\nA: Also, sometimes it's simply the X-Server which hangs - a case I've most often found when you're using Compiz.\nIf this is the case you can kill X, which will restart and drop you back at the log-in screen.\nThe default sequence is Ctrl + Alt + Backspace\nAlthough this is turned off by default (presumably new-users were accidentally hitting it) and can be turned back on like this: \n\n\n*\n\n*System → Keyboard (i.e. the Keyboard Preferences Dialogue)\n\n*Layouts tab\n\n*Click the Options button\n\n*At the Key Sequence to kill the X server point check Ctrl + Alt + Backspace.\n\n\nA: My first favourite when total freeze occured - Alt + SysRq + K.\nThat combo kills X, and returns me to the graphical login screen. If that doesn't work, try Alt + SysRq + R E I S U B.\n\nA: I was having similar issues with 10.04.  X would hang and and nothing but a reset would fix it.  I updated my nvidia drivers to the latest version and I haven't had issues since.\n\nA: Replace with the latest Linux kernel 2.6.35 or up that will solve your problem.  Follow these steps from this link.\n\nA: if possible, try to open an ssh shell from another computer. this is an option If you knew in advance that the computer might hang soon, open the connection first before you perform that task.\nI do this sometimes when I know vmware runs crazy and the GUI of ubuntu (the vmware host) becomes unresponsive. I can do a suspend from the ssh shell, it might take a while until it gets thru, and after a while the computer is idle again.\n\nA: In the very specific case you are using Virtualbox to run a 64-bit guest on a 32-bit  (Ubuntu) host using VT-x or AMD-V (hardware virtualization technology built-in your CPU) only\nVirtualbox may make your 32-bit host randomly crash when you run a 64-bit guest on it using VT-x or AMD-V (hardware virtualization technology built-in your CPU). It is a known issue.\n2 solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to run 32-bit guests only on your current 32-bit host [recommended if you have less than 2 GB of RAM];\n\n*You have to switch to Ubuntu 64-bit as host (you can even perform a 32-bit to 64-bit \"migration\" by reinstalling Ubuntu 64-bit without touching to your \"/home\" folder) [recommended if you have 2 GB of RAM or more].\n\n\nPlease note that you can run 64-bit and 32-bit guests on a 64-bit host using Virtualbox without any problem.\nOther answers have very well covered general cases...\n\nA: If you have tried all of the above and the freezing problem remains, you might want to try what I did.\nApply generous amounts of contact cleaner to CPU, RAM and any other chip complex enough to show those tiny, tightly packed pins. They can lose conductivity from dust accumulation as well as shorting due to humidity.\nSome days after the cleaning (I used CRC 2-26) and a series of really brutal stress tests, my PC hasn't frozen once.\nSo, for all of you getting sudden unexpected freezings, give up messing around with your OS beyond what's reasonable and do an exhaustive dust and contact cleaning.\n\nA: DoR and Phoenix has answered this well. To make this page more complete I would add:  \nIf it is only X that is \"broken\", than you can use kernel to kill it: \nSysRq + Alt + K \nFor laptops (depends on the model, typically needed if \"SysRq\" is written in blue):  \nFn + SysRq + Alt + K (release Fn after pressing SysRq).\n\nA: In such cases you can try CTRL-ALT-F1 to get to a console. Then login with your password.\nRestarting the GUI\nYou can try to restart your graphical desktop with:\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nIf you're running Ubuntu 11.04 or earlier, you should use this instead (as gdm used to be the default display manager):\nsudo service gdm restart\n\nIf you're using Kubuntu instead, then the default display manager is kdm, so you should instead use:\nsudo service kdm restart\n\nIf you're using  another display manager, replace ligthdm/gdm/kdm with its name.\nRestarting the Machine\nIf you want to do a clean system reboot, use:\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\n\nA: What I do is opening a terminal with eg. Ctrl + Alt + F2\nLogin and use the terminal to kill the process that is lagging\nps -e | grep <procesname>\n\nThis shows the processID of the process with that name\n(sudo) kill <processID>\n\nThis shuts down the process safely, in case that doesn't work use\n(sudo) kill -9 <processID>\n\nUse the man pages for more information about these commands.\nYou can get back to the graphical user interface with Ctrl + Alt + F7\n\nA: The first thing to look at is if it is just X that's frozen, or the whole system.  Enable ssh and then ssh into the system.  If you can't ssh into it, then it's probably a kernel lock up.  If you can ssh in, then it might be just a gpu lockup.\nNext try restarting X. Do this by restarting the display manager:\n\n\n*\n\n*On Ubuntu 11.10 and later, LightDM is the display manager, so run:\nservice lightdm restart\n\n\n*On Ubuntu 11.04 and earlier, GDM is the display manager, so run:\nservice gdm restart\n\nIf that works, then it's perhaps an X bug.  If it still doesn't work, then you may have a GPU lockup in the kernel drm driver.  It would be useful to know at this point whether you're running the -ati (open source) driver, or -fglrx (closed source) driver.\n\nA: To diagnose the freezes you should be able to use the net console (or serial serial console for that matter). Follow the set up instructions outlined here.\n\nA: If you have to do a hard shutdown I'd be wondering if the memory (RAM) was failing. On your next boot, try running memtest86. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*while booting, hold down a shift key\n\n*the GRUB menu will appear\n\n*use the cursor keys to select the last option \"memtest86\"\n\n*press enter\n\n\nYou'll get a basic display and it will try reading and writing lots of values to all of your RAM. As long as there are no failures, you'll see a green status. If there is any failure it will turn red. In that case you'll need to replace at least one stick of your RAM.\nThere is also community documentation of diagnosing hardware failures.\n\nA: If you ever use the magic SysRq key as suggested in the first answer, just try getting the keyboard to work first with Alt + SysRq + R; then try Ctrl + Alt + F1 again.\nIt may work and you may save yourself a reboot. Only if it doesn't work you should try the whole REISUB sequence.\n\nA: Just press Ctrl + Alt + F1 on your keyboard to open TTY1. When it opens, run the kill command. An example is below.\nFirst you use ps.\nThis will show you all processes running (ps | less if you want to see the results page by page). \nThen you look for the PID of the process you want to terminate.\nAfter this use: kill pid\n\nkill command- Stop a process from running\nSyntax: kill [-s sigspec] [-n signum] [-sigspec] jobspec or pid kill -l [exit_status]\nDescription:  Most modern shells, Bash included, have a built-in kill\nfunction. In Bash, both signal names and numbers are\n\naccepted as options, and arguments may be job or process IDs. An exit\nstatus can be reported using the -l option: zero when at least one\nsignal was successfully sent, non-zero if an error occurred. Using the\nkill command from /usr/bin, your system might enable extra options,\nsuch as the ability to kill processes from other than your own user ID\nand specifying processes by name, like with pgrep and pkill. Both kill\ncommands send the TERM signal if none is given.\n\n\nExtra: Use Ctrl+Alt+Del for Task Manager in Linux to Kill Tasks Easily\n\nA: I have found that the culprit in my case was plain and simple overheating. I live in a warmer climate and if I am not running airconditioning my laptop starts locking up. Pointing a fan directly at it resolved the problem.\n\nA: One of the solutions I found that stopped my computer from freezing was to stop the  cpu scheduler setting itself to ondemand. This is found in the /etc/init.d/ondemand script. \nI just renamed the file.\nsudo mv /etc/init.d/ondemand /etc/init.d/ondemand.bk\n\nThis breaks all the symbolic links to ondemand. So it won't start up at boot time. This will put some error messages into your log.\nA better way is to use update-rc.d. I was lasy and have not tried these commands. \nsudo update-rc.d -f ondemand remove  \n\nOr:\nsudo update-rc.d ondemand stop 2 3 4 5 S\n\nTo start it again:\nsudo update-rc.d ondemand Start 2 3 4 5 S  \n\nAlthough starting it again caused my computer to free again. So I left it disabled.\n\nA: *\n\n*Press Ctrl+alt+t to get the terminal, then find the hanging process (ps -ef | grep ) then kill it using pid found (kill -9 )\n\n\n*Press Ctrl+alt+F2 (in some cases fn key also to be pressed) to enter single user mode.\nLogin and restart lightdm/kdm service\nsudo service start lightdm.\n\n\n*Graceful reset press alt+print screen+r+e+i+s+u+b\n\n\n*If still issue, then power off button is last resort :)\n\nA: I had a custom built PC keep freezing on me.  I put the temperature sensors in the gnome panel and was able to see if the CPU, HDD, Motherboard (basically any system temp) were getting hot at the time of the lock.\nYour ATI card might be running hot and you need increased airflow. \n\nA: If you are using motherboard of intel 8xx, then I would strongly recommend to migrate to Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat, I think they have solved the Xorg related bugs.\nI had faced the same problems but once I installed Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat, I have never faced any Xfreeze issue.\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installed on Lenovo Thinkpad core i5, it kept on freezing completely and I had to manually restart it by power cycle. I solved it by updating my Ubuntu kernel to latest version. It might fix your problem too. Here are the instructions to do that:\n1- Go here: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nDownload 3 (maybe 4) debs to a folder somewhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-headers-VERSION-NUMBER_all.deb\n\n*linux-headers-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb\n\n*linux-image-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb\n\n*linux-image-extra-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb   # if available\n2- Install the debs with whatever package manager front-end you use (for example, Gdebi), or use these commands:\ncd /path/to/folder/where/you/put/the/debs\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nSource: How to update kernel to the latest mainline version without any Distro-upgrade?\n\nA: I have a simple fix for random freezes happening under Ubuntu 12.04 (kernel 3.5.0-41) on HP DV7, just use unity_2d :\nsudo vi /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nReplace user-session=ubuntu with user-session=ubuntu-2d\nsudo reboot\n\nMore info on http://cleanstructions.blogspot.fr/2013/10/fix-random-freezes-ubuntu-1204.html\nMemtest passed many times and it just happened from one day to the other, possibly after an upgrade. I just couldn't investigate the kernel panic, the whole system was locked and logs (when available) were not displaying anything relevant to me.\nHas anyone has an idea about what is wrong with my graphics card for not supporting open GL anymore?\n\nA: For those who:\n\n\n*\n\n*have screen freezes but applications are still working\n\n*and you can do Ctrl + Alt + F1\n\n*and you have no other option but to restart (service lightdm restart doesn't work)\n\n*and you have too many applications open and don't want to lose your session\n\n\nMaybe you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*go do the Ctrl + Alt + F1\n\n*run pm-suspend (will suspend the machine)\n\n*start the machine; \nyou should get the machine back to the state before the screen freezes (at least for me it did)\n\n\nI've tried all solutions suggested above, but none of them work or part of it worked but I was still forced to restart the machine and lose all running applications.  This is not the best solution but at least I don't lose the applications I need when working.\n\nA: Before you try the next key combination, please remember that Ctrl+Alt+F7 brings you back.  Remember?  Really?  OK, then: If the Ubuntu GUI doesn't show up or freezes just use Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to a terminal.\nYou should have pressed Ctrl+Alt+F7 to see this message again.\nIt is the easiest solution, but not permanent, after that your Ubuntu can continue to  freeze, but you can repeat this process every time, when Ubuntu freezes. :)\n\nA: In my case compiz causes the freezing; I can move mouse cursor, but mouse clicks do nothing. The keyboard works, so, my recipe is restarting compiz\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl + Alt + F1\n\n*Run this command:\nkillall -9 compiz\n\n\n*Press Ctrl + Alt + F7\n\nA: After suffering with this for over a year I worked around the problem by using Xfce as the desktop environment. I simply installed it using APT: \n    sudo apt-get install xfce4\nI have a 2009 PC with in-built graphics and it intermittently had problems every time graphics settings were adjusted (whether via Ubuntu's auto updates or not I'm not sure). \nI suppose I could have given Unity 2D a try but Xfce works.\n\nA: First of all use the top command in the terminal to see the PID of the unresponsive program Top Function in Terminal\nThen kill -9 \"pid\" without the quotes. \nIf the nothing at all responds to your click and key strokes or your mouse stops working then press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and restart the display manager by running:\nsudo service lightdm start     # Ubuntu 12.04/14.04  \n\nor  \nsudo systemctl start graphical.target     # Ubuntu 16.04 and later\n\nIf it fails, don't worry. Pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7 will bring you back to your desktop environment.\n\nA: Installing the wrong graphics driver was the root of the problem for me.\nUsing nouveau, stopped the freezing, but it was slow.\nI realized by using nvidia-detect that the graphics driver I should install was nvidia-304 for Geforce GT 8500.\n\nA: On my laptop when it freezes, I'm able to do control + alt + fn + f7, then control + alt + fn+ f2. This gets to the shell, then I login with my username and password. To go back to the desktop I do chvt 8 this gets me back to my current desktop. To find out the active tty's type w then chvt to the current one.\nThat way you can resume your work without rebooting or losing anything.\n\nA: I just needed to power-cycle the machine after installing the candidate kernels from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown. No hardware problems here but beware of such side effects when running on non-stable kernels.\n\nA: If you are able to switch between applications, and not able to use them (for example, unable to change tabs in a browser or scroll) Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, just click the log out button and press Cancel instead of logging out. This will restore the original unfrozen state.\n", "Q: How can I empty the trash without first opening it? The only way I've seen how to empty the trash is to use the Empty Trash button that is displayed after choosing Go | Trash in Nautilus. If there are too many items in the trash it can take a long time for the list of files to load, especially when Nautilus defaults to generating thumbnails.\nIs there a way to empty the trash that doesn't require opening it first?\n\nA: If you have the \"Trash Applet\" on the lower right of the screen by default, you can right-click and get a menu with \"Empty Trash\". In the shell you can just\n$ empty-trash\n\n\nA: If you enable a trash icon on the desktop, You can right click on it and select 'Empty Deleted Items'. Also, within the file manager, you don't have to navigate into the Deleted Items folder; you can right click on the Deleted Items place on the left hand side and select 'Empty Deleted Items'.\n\nA: In Unity, a trash icon is provided at the bottom of the launcher.

There are also some things to fix this issue in the bug thread.\nI haven't found a plugin for empathy to add the tray icon back.\n", "Q: Where do applications typically store data? I was wondering if there was a standard location for storing user level application data. What I mean by that is stuff like Firefox bookmarks, Skype message history/password, etc. I'm asking because I am not sure if I should go with home directory encryption vs full disk encryption.\n\nA: Your home directory is the only place where you can store files permanently. Applications typically store their configuration and automatically saved data in a file or directory called .application-name in your home directory. (Some applications save in groups, e.g., ~/.gconf contains data from many Gnome applications.)\nHowever, you can have confidential or privacy-relevant data stored in other places. Whether you want to encrypt these places depends on how sensitive you think that data is.\n\n\n*\n\n*Anything (well, almost) that can be in RAM can also be in swap. It takes a bit of work and a bit of luck, but someone who steals your disk could find some worthwhile data in the swap.\n\n*Many applications store temporary files in /tmp.\n\n*If receive mail locally (as opposed to fetching it from a POP or IMAP server), it arrives in /var/mail. If you send mail using the traditional unix method (sendmail), it transits via /var/spool/postfix (or whatever your MTA is). If you don't understand this paragraph, it doesn't apply to you.\n\n*If you set up recurring tasks, they are stored in /var/spool/cron.\n\n*When you print something, it transits in /var/spool/cups.\n\n*The system logs might contain data you'd rather keep private, such as network errors from sites you've tried to connect to or from.\nYou can encrypt the swap partition with dm_crypt (install the cryptsetup and read the documentation; or do it as part of the initial installation, but I think you'll have to use the alternate CD).\nOnce you've encrypted the swap, /tmp is best dealt with by making it tmpfs. See here for a write-up.\nYou might choose to use tmpfs for other things such as print spools. But it's not suitable for others such as system logs. If you're going to encrypt every possibly-sensitive data, you might as well encrypt the whole system.\n\nA: From the examples you have provided, I take it that you mean application data specific to a certain user's configuration, usage or the data owned by the user (e.g., mail messages, templates, themes). In this case, these data are stored in the user's home directory as \"dot-files\" or inside an application-specific \"dot-directory\".\nQuoting from the Unix file-system hierarchy standard:\n\n/home : User home directories (optional)\nPurpose\n/home is a fairly standard concept, but it is clearly a site-specific filesystem. The setup will differ from host to host. Therefore, no program should rely on this location.\nRequirements\nUser specific configuration files for applications are stored in the user's home directory in a file that starts with the '.' character (a \"dot file\"). If an application needs to create more than one dot file then they should be placed in a subdirectory with a name starting with a '.' character, (a \"dot directory\"). In this case the configuration files should not start with the '.' character.\n\nThe linux file-system hierarchy standard also states almost the same thing.\nFor example, the user's configuration for the vim editor is stored in .vimrc inside the home directory, the firefox profile (containing among other things the users bookmarks and history information) is stored in a separate directory  within the user's home-directory (~/.mozilla/firefox/<randomstring>.default)\nTypically all applications will store information about user initiated sessions, passwords etc within the user's home directory in such \"dot-files/ directories\".\nSo (extrapolating a bit), if you want just enough encryption that user-specific data is protected, then home directory encryption alone would suffice.\nHaving said that, it is possible, like with all things linux, to customize and override the default location and choose to store these application specific user-data elsewhere. However, in Ubuntu, that needs to be explicitly done by the user.\n\nA: In addition to what Giles said, if you use Apache Webserver (or pretty much any other webserver) they save your website files in /var/www\nI'm not sure where SQL Server saves your Databases as a default...I'm forever learning :)\nVortex\n", "Q: How can I prevent maximized windows from overlapping conky window I run conky in its own window of type \"panel\".

I've got several Ubuntu machines on my network at home, but the DNS is provided by a windows server (2K).  When I ssh to them from another , if I ssh to them as \"machine\" I can't connect, but if I connect as \"machine.local\" I can connect.\nI think similarly, I can't connect from a windows client (like putty).\nWhat's going on here? - it's clearly an Ubuntu thing.\n\nA: By default, Ubuntu includes avahi. This is an implementation of zeroconf which allows computer hostnames to be resolved with the virtual \".local\" name. Whenever your computer tries to connect to \"hostname.local\", avahi will perform local network broadcasts to see if there any computers with that hostname. Other computers running avahi (or something compatible) should answer. \nIf you look in /etc/nsswitch.conf, you will find the following line:\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\n\nThe mdns4_minimal is the configuration setting that makes this redirection work.\nYour question actually suggests that avahi is running successfully as you say that you can connect to your Ubuntu computers using \"hostname.local\". However, you do not make it clear (\"When I ssh to them from another, ...\") if you are trying to connect from another Ubuntu computer, or from another Windows computer. Without installing other software such as Bonjour, Windows computers cannot resolve zeroconf-style \"hostname.local\" names.\n\nA: To fix your issue, you just need Avahi. This announces your Ubuntu machine names to the Windows lot.\nsudo apt-get install avahi-daemon\n\nmachinename.local works thanks to another implementation of zeroconf (of which Avahi is also) called Bonjour, created (IIRC) by Apple. It's installed by default. I don't know why Avahi isn't also but given the confusion it causes people, it probably aught to be.\nThere's more on this on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.local\n", "Q: How do I use ffmpeg's \"-vf\" / \"-vfilters\" option without recompiling ffmpeg myself? I have ffmpeg install from apt (version 4:0.5.1-1ubuntu1). I have a video that is up-side-down, so I want to flip it vertically. The ffmpeg documentation says to use the -vf option (which I see was recently renamed from -vfilters). However that just doesn't work for me. I get an error like: ffmpeg: unrecognized option '-vf'.\nI know there are all kinds of legal reasons why ffmpeg is not the full options, but surely flipping a video should be OK? There are many guides for ubuntu and ffmpeg which advise to recompile it yourself. e.g. the number 2 hit for \"ubuntu ffmpeg\" is a guide on ubuntu forums on recompiling ffmpeg yourself.\nI don't want to recompile it myself. I am a fan of package managers and \"doing things the right way\". There should be a way to get this functionality in the packaged version, otherwise there is a bug in the packaged version.\nHow can I get the -vf/-vfilter option in ffmpeg? (If I can't get it, why not?)\n\nA: You are right, the ffmpeg packages in Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 do not support video filters. If you use Ubuntu 10.10, you can add unofficial packages from the Debian Multimedia Project and install their ffmpeg version (you should not do this if you use Ubuntu 10.04, there are too many conflicts with older packages. Also do not combine those packages with ubuntu-restriced-extras). Then the following works\nffmpeg -i in.avi -vf vflip out.avi\n\nAn easier option ̣- if all you want to do is flip videos - is to use the mencoder package instead of ffmpeg. After installing the package, the following works (copying the audio, encoding the video with libavcodecs):\nmencoder -vf flip -o out.avi -oac copy -ovc lavc in.avi\n\n\nA: If you don't want to compile it yourself, you should just grab a static build from the ffmpeg Downloads page (scroll down to 'FFmpeg Linux Builds').\n\nA: you could try avconv\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/507386/libav-vs-ffmpeg-better-to-use-libav-avconv-today\nlooks to me like libav is thought to become a successor of ffmpeg\n", "Q: pgadmin3: Unable to initialize gtk, is DISPLAY set properly? I'm having some trouble getting pgadmin3 to run on a remote server.  I'm logging in to the server using SSH with the -X option.  When I first installed pgadmin3, I was able to launch it using the command \"pgadmin3 &\", and PG Admin would launch correctly using my local X server.  Something has happened though, and now PG Admin will no longer launch.  It bounces back with the message \"Error: Unable to initialize gtk, is DISPLAY set properly?\"\nI'm using the same SSH command to log in to the server, and the same command to launch PG Admin, yet it is no longer working.  I haven't made any changes to my SSH configuration, nor have I installed any new software, so I'm at a loss as to how this broke and how to go about fixing it.  What could have happened to break this, and where do I start with fixing it?\n\nA: The clue is in the error message: What is the DISPLAY environment variable set to?\nIt is probably incorrect or has changed.\n\nA: Check that the xauth package is installed on the server, as it is needed for ssh X forwarding to work properly.\n\nA: None of these address the problem - I have the same thing and no fault in the $DISPLAY value.  Even if you avoid SSH and go direct it does not work.\nSo what changed?  It worked before and then it just stopped working???\nRunning the xhost command (i.e., typing it in a terminal and pressing enter) fixed it for me - but I still am clueless why it worked before without this step.\nThen do your su, run the program, etc.\n", "Q: What is the \"floppy0\" icon in Computer?

I want to understand why it is here.\n\nA: You could try deleting 'floppy0' in /media.\nOr perhaps blacklisting the floppy driver by editing \n/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nand adding\nblacklist floppy.\n\nA: I was confused about this for a while on a computer I built without a floppy drive. I disabled the interface in the BIOS, even, yet it still was being seen by the OS. Turns out there was still an entry for the floppy drive in /etc/fstab that was causing it to be shown, even though there was nothing for it to load.\nIf removing the line there doesn't do the trick, try adding blacklist floppy to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf to prevent the kernel from loading the floppy driver at all.\n\nA: The floppy disk drive is a legacy drive and is incorporated in most operating systems so that it is available if required.\nSince the distributions of Linux cannot match every hardware configuration they do their best guess at matching the most configurations and hence they have not completely removed it in you particular case.\nIf you added an external floppy drive you would at least have the device available (although I think it is still blocked somewhere)\n", "Q: Patch for new 64bit kernel vulnerability?

It appears that things have been moved around a bit in recent releases. The \"Mouse Keys\" tab wasn't there in my Keyboard preferences (Ubuntu 11.10, gnome shell), so @JavierRivera's solution set me on the right track, but didn't solve the problem of turning off the \"control pointer using keypad\" option. This is where I did find it:\nSettings > Universal Access > Pointing and Clicking\n\nI also enabled \"Numeric keypad keys work as with Macintosh\" since I'm using an imac keyboard. This option is found in:\nSettings > Keyboard Layout > Layouts > Options > Miscellaneous compatibility options\n\nwhich seems to be necessary for me.\n", "Q: Enable remote VNC from the commandline?

If you  use folder view then you can have a  different folder for each desktop and in that folder you could make a link that would only be visible for that folder view. It can be really confusing for most people, but  I've done it with a different wallpaper and a different folder view on for four different desktops.\nHere's how I would do it: Right click on the Desktop, choose Activities. Click on the Desktop in the ribbon at the bottom and choose new activity. You choose folder view and set the location as a different folder from in your home directory.

Ubuntu seems expensive to develop and maintain. Bandwidth, development, marketing, and maintenance all cost money, and since Ubuntu is free to download and use, I don't see who pays for it all.\nI ask because I'm a happy Ubuntu user since 2006 and wonder how sustainable the project is.\n\nA: The Ubuntu project is lead by a company called Canonical Ltd.\nThey make their money by providing enterprise software services, training, support, consultancy, and various other services directly related to Ubuntu.\nYou can read about the relationship between Canonical and Ubuntu.\n\nA: In short: Canonical funds it.\nWhere they get the money from is perhaps a better question. Well they sell services and support and they also have a fairly wealthy founder in the shape of Mark Shuttleworth.\nEdit: As others have said, the latest report we have on finances is from 2008 when the company wasn't near breaking even but as I've just detailed in a comment, for things you believe in, breaking even isn't everything... Especially when you can afford for it to make a loss.\nOf course the aim is for the project to become self-sufficient but at the moment the only return on investment comes through the channels I've already talked about. OEM services, B2B support, consumer level paid support. You have to respect that once Ubuntu hits critical mass gets real demand, the demand for professional services and complimentary products also increases.\nIf you want detailed financial information, I suggest you call Canonical. They'll either give you the numbers or tell you to stop being so nosey... But they're the only people that can tell you for certain.\nEdit 2 (Re: \"can't have it both ways\"): - Utter nonsense!

Is there a way to disable the middle mouse button paste behavior that is here by default on gnome?\nI have a sensitive mouse wheel and whenever I scroll texts, sometimes it pastes stuff randomly into the text. I lose quite a lot of credibility when I send a file to someone else that has random text snippets pasted all over it.\nI have seen a solution that goes by mapping the mouse's middle button to a non-existant mouse button, but that implies getting rid of the middle mouse button altogether (i.e. no tab-closing, opening links into a new tab automatically, etc.). I'd like to keep my middle mouse button active, just disable the pasting behavior.\nThis also happens when I scroll text with my touchpad (accidentally hit two-fingers without moving, bam.) \nSo the problem will not be fixed just by changing for a new mouse (in fact I believe it happens more often with my touchpad than with my mouse).\n\nA: I use gnome-tweak-tool for disabling middle button paste in Ubuntu 16.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install it\nsudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n\n*Run it by searching \"tweak tool\" in installed apps or just type gnome-tweak-tool in a terminal.\n\n*Go to \"Keyboard and mouse\" -> \"Middle-click paste\"\n\n*Turn off.\n\nThat's it.\nOr using just CLI\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-enable-primary-paste false\n\nTested on 16.04.\n\nA: I realise that this is not exactly the answer you want, but you can turn this off in Firefox (e.g. if you don't mind the feature elsewhere, but still want middle click in Firefox to open links in new tabs)\nIn about:config, set\nmiddlemouse.contentLoadURL false\nmiddlemouse.paste false\n\nNot what you asked, but as this question is linked to from a few places I hope someone finds this answer useful.\n\nA: Edit: In my opinion the following answer is a better solution than mine: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/501445/72554\nHere's the simplest solution I've found to keep middle click functional without it pasting things.\nFirst install sxhkd and xsel.\nThen configure ~/.config/.sxhkd/sxhkdrc like so\n~button2\n    echo -n | xsel -n -i\n~control + c\n    echo -n | xsel -n -i\n~control + x\n    echo -n | xsel -n -i\n\nAnd that's basically it.\nNow start sxhkd (or configure it to launch on startup). Now, middle mouse will no longer paste anything but will otherwise function like normal.  (As long as you use only ctrl+c and ctrl+x to copy things that is, if you copy things with the mouse it can paste once before it returns to normal.)\n\nA: I suggest using one of these, which work mostly well for me:\nusing xbindkeys: \nwhenever middle-button is pressed, clear the primary clipboard. At least on my system it is cleared, before the pasting happens.\nDetails: create xbindkeys-config: \nxbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\n\nPaste the following new hotkey:\n\"xclip -i /dev/null\"    \n    b:2``\n\nReload xbindkeys (e.g. killall xbindkeys;xbindkeys). Done.\nusing xdotool:\nClear the clipboard on window focus change (should work with most windowmanagers). Details:\nExecute the following command:\nxdotool search --onlyvisible . behave %@ focus exec xclip -i /dev/null\n\nNote that with this command you can still use the primary clipboard within the same window, or pressing middlemouse onto another window BEFORE focusing it (if you don't have \"focus follows mouse\", or somthing, activated).\n\nA: For Gnome applications you can use gnome-tweaks (new name of gnome-tweak-tool package) under the \"Keyboard & Mouse\" tab there's the \"Middle Click Paste\" option or editing directly the org.gnome.desktop.interface/gtk-enable-primary-paste Gnome option.\nFor KDE applications seems that there's an equivalent solution.\nFor the whole X (including non Gnome applications) you can install XMousePasteBlock which then has to be running (by the user is enough, no root required) in order to work. This disables completely the middle click paste without disabling the other middle click functions.\n\nA: Jared Robinson gave a simple solution that works on my machine:\nRun the following command:\nxmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\"\n\nTo persist this behavior, edit ~/.Xmodmap and add\npointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n\nA: The best way I've found so far is to use EasyStroke, which can globally intercept middle-button click and allow to behave as middle button only in certain apps. \nYou can add a \"group\" in EasyStroke to apply this interception in multiple applications at once.\nI've set to disable middle click in some of my text editors, IDE and MATLAB only and works as intended.\nReference:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11811126&postcount=25\nComplete EasyStroke How-To:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/easystroke/wiki/Documentation\n\nA: This currently isn't possible - though, as you have mentioned, there are ways to disable the MOUSE 3 button - or remap it- none of those get at the source of the issue. The X11 Primary Selection.\nWhile this isn't a solution, hopefully this explanation will make it clear WHY. In Ubuntu there are two clipboards at work. One, which everyone is familiar with, the freedesktop.org clipboard (captures Ctrl+C command) The second is a clipboard manager that has been at play since before Ubuntu even existed - X11. The X Server (X11) manages three other clipboards: Primary Selection, Secondary Selection, and Clipboard. When you select text with your pointer it gets copied to a buffer in the XServer, the Primary Selection, and awaits pasting by means of the Mouse 3 button. The other two were designed to be used by other applications in a means to share a common clipboard between applications. In this case the freedesktop.org clipboard manager in Ubuntu already does this for us.\nThrough the extent of my research I can not find a way to disable the X11 selection manager. There are no compilation flags, applications, or configuration values that can disable this. There are various ways around this on a per application basis (majority of these applications being command line ones) - but nothing on a global scale.\nI realize this isn't an ideal solution - but seems to be the truth to the issue. The only relevant solution I could muster is actually a hack, create a script that executes an infinite while loop that just replaces the Primary Selection with a null value.\nFirst install xsel (Tool for manipulation of the X selection) sudo apt-get install xsel\nThe code is as follows:\nwhile(true)\ndo\n    echo -n | xsel -n -i\n    sleep 0.5\ndone\n\nIf you place this in a script and add it to your startup scripts this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nA: Somehow, I ended up without any xmodmap files on my Ubuntu install, so I had to find a different approach to this problem.\nTake a look at the xinput command. \nxinput list | grep -i mouse\n\nwhich lists information about your mouse.  It shows my mouse is \"Dell Premium USB Optical Mouse\" and also that I have \"Macintosh mouse button emulation\".  Armed with that info, I can \nxinput get-button-map \"Dell Premium USB Optical Mouse\"\n\nwhich gives me a listing that looks like\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n\nHere is the useful, required knowledge.  My mouse has, theoretically, 18 buttons.  Each button's default action has the same name as it's button number.  In other words, button 1 does action 1, button 4 does action 4, etc.  Action 0 means \"off\".\nThe position in the listing shows the function assigned to that button.  So if my button map read\n1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n\nthis would mean button 1 (position 1) does action 1 (normal left button), button 2 (position 2) does action 3 (middle button) and button 3 (position 3) does action 2 (right button).\nTo make a left handed mouse all you would need would be a button map that starts\n3 2 1 4 5 .....\n\nOr, in your case, it looks like you want the middle button to do the same thing as button 1 (left button) so your map needs to start\n1 1 3 ....\n\nI'd reset my mouse button mappings thus:\nxinput set-button-map \"Dell Premium USB Optical Mouse\" 1 1 3 5 6 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n\nIn your case, you may have a different number of mapped buttons and have some special button map already defined.  Likwely, your mouse has a different name, too.  First, get your mouse's \"name\". Then, use the get-button-map operation to find your base button map. finally, use the set-button-map option, modifying button 2 to do action 1.\nThis is not a permanent change.  I added the necessary code to my .bashrc so it executes every time I login or open a terminal.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: This middle mouse button paste behavior is a feature of the X server (and gpm on the text console) and as far as I know at least X.org can't be configured to disable it - all you can do is to change the mapping of the physical mouse buttons as others already suggested.\nChances are good that you can configure your touchpad to avoid unwanted middle clicks, see gpointing-device-settings (not installed by default) or the synaptics manpage if you prefer to use your editor for configuration.\n\nA: the link below fixed the problem for me.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Input#Example:_Disabling_middle-mouse_button_paste_on_a_scrollwheel_mouse\nthe page refered by the above link has a section for how to disable the middle mouse paste on scrollwheel, by executing few commands the user can fetch the mouse buttons mapping and can also change the mapping.\nas explained in the page i disabled the the middle button by executing the command:\n$ xinput set-button-map 4 1 0 3\n\n\nA: For a solution to the problem, please view this guide I wrote:\n\nA while ago, I wrote a patch to disable the 'middle mouse button paste' functionality in GTK. I thought that there would be others who want to disable it as well, and hence I thought I should write a small guide to explain how this feat can be accomplished.\nNow, some may ask, why would anyone want to disable it? There are a few reasons:\n\n*\n\n*The middle mouse button doesn't actually paste the so-called XA_CLIPBOARD clipboard, but the XA_PRIMARY clipboard. This is probably counterintuitive to many (users coming from Windows, perhaps), and therefore some may view it as more user-friendly to disable the \"inconsistent\" or unexpected behavior.\n\n*Some may accidentally paste text using the middle mouse button, and want to avoid that.\n\nA bit of background regarding the XA_CLIPBOARD and XA_PRIMARY clipboard:\nThe XA_PRIMARY clipboard is used mostly for storing selections. Whenever you select some text in for example the GNOME Text Editor (gedit), this text is copied to the XA_PRIMARY clipboard. This text is not pasted when you use the 'Edit -> Paste' menu item, only when you click the middle mouse button. The XA_CLIPBOARD clipboard is mostly used when one uses the general 'Copy/Paste' functionality (through keyboard shortcuts, such as CTRL+C and CTRL+V, or through the menu items 'Edit -> Copy' and 'Edit -> Paste').\nPerhaps a patch of this sort (or more drastic changes to the X clipboard and/or how libraries/applications use it) could some day become standard in Linux. I realize opinions on this differ greatly. However, for people who seek to minimize the chances of accidentally pasting some random text, the patch can be pretty useful. For example, with the patch, you can't accidentally paste (at least, with the middle mouse button) text into a document you are editing, or into a web page, or into an instant message, etc.\nThe guide is for Debian or Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Mint.\nWhat follows are terminal commands with a brief description of what they do (the lines starting with # are comments, which contain these descriptions). You should start a terminal and enter the commands one by one, after carefully reading the descriptions.\n# This is a small guide that explains how to patch GTK so that the middle mouse\n# button doesn't paste text anymore.\n\n# NOTE:\n# The below instructions are for GTK2. However, they should be easy to adapt\n# for GTK3 (at the time of writing, the patch works fine for GTK3 too).\n\n# First, update the system by first synchronizing the package index files, and\n# then upgrading the packages.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n# Get the build dependencies and essential packages needed in order to compile\n# code and create packages.\nsudo apt-get build-dep libgtk2.0-0\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\n# Create a temporary directory, in which we will store the GTK sources and\n# later on the packages.\nmkdir /tmp/gtk\ncd /tmp/gtk\n\n# Download the actual patch that will disable the 'middle mouse button paste'\n# functionality (it should be stored in the directory '/tmp/gtk', and will be,\n# if you indeed executed the command 'cd /tmp/gtk').\nwget http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/slipstream/patches/gtk_disable_middle_mouse_button_paste.patch\n\n# Retrieve the GTK sources.\napt-get source libgtk2.0-0\n\n# You should adapt this line so that it changes to the correct directory (the\n# name of the directory that I used here will probably not match the name of\n# the directory that was created during 'apt-get source libgtk2.0-0', as it\n# contains a version number that often changes). You can find out what the\n# correct directory is by entering 'ls -d */' (without the quotes) and looking\n# at the names of the directories that it shows.\ncd gtk+2.0-2.20.1\n\n# Apply the patch that we downloaded earlier.\npatch -p1 < /tmp/gtk/gtk_disable_middle_mouse_button_paste.patch\n\n# The output of the previous command should be:\n#     patching file gtk/gtkselection.c\n# If it wasn't, then something went wrong. Maybe you mistyped something, maybe\n# the current directory isn't the correct directory, maybe the GTK sources\n# were changed and the patch doesn't work anymore, etc.\n\n# Build the package (you may have to be patient, this may or may not take a\n# while).\ndpkg-buildpackage -uc -us --source-option=--auto-commit\n\n# You should adapt this line so that it installs the correct package. The\n# package that we want to install is the package containing the GTK library,\n# thus _not_ the 'bin', 'udeb', 'common', 'dev', or 'doc' package. To find out\n# what the exact package is that you should install, try to find the package (a\n# file with a name ending in '.deb') which is closest to the example filename I\n# used here (the packages are stored in '/tmp/gtk', and you can list the\n# packages using the command 'ls /tmp/gtk/*.deb' (without the quotes)).\nsudo dpkg -i ../libgtk2.0-0_2.20.1-2_i386.deb\n\n# And lastly, to make sure that only the patched library is in use, you should\n# either log out and back in, or restart your computer.\n# And then, the 'middle mouse button paste' functionality should be disabled.\n# To test whether it is, try selecting some text in the GNOME Text Editor, or\n# in a GNOME Terminal, and then press the middle mouse button while the cursor\n# hovers over some place where you can normally type text. If indeed no text\n# appears, then it appears that the patch worked.\n# If however, the patch did not work, try to re-read this document, to see if\n# you made any mistake. And if you did, you may want to either start all over\n# again (should be fail-safe), or continue with the guide from the point where\n# you made a mistake.\n\n\nOr, more directly, here's the patch to disable the 'middle mouse button paste' functionality in GTK:\ndiff -ur gtk+2.0-2.20.1/gtk/gtkselection.c gtk+2.0-2.20.1-patched/gtk/gtkselection.c\n--- gtk+2.0-2.20.1/gtk/gtkselection.c   2010-05-01 22:14:29.000000000 -0500\n+++ gtk+2.0-2.20.1-patched/gtk/gtkselection.c   2011-09-17 10:45:37.000000000 -0500\n@@ -1065,6 +1065,24 @@\n   display = gtk_widget_get_display (widget);\n   owner_window = gdk_selection_owner_get_for_display (display, selection);\n\n+  if (selection == gdk_atom_intern(\"PRIMARY\", TRUE)) {\n+      GtkSelectionData selection_data;\n+\n+      selection_data.selection = selection;\n+      selection_data.target = target;\n+      selection_data.type = gdk_atom_intern(\"STRING\", TRUE);\n+      selection_data.format = 8;\n+      selection_data.data = (unsigned char *)\"\";\n+      selection_data.length = 0;\n+      selection_data.display = display;\n+\n+      gtk_selection_retrieval_report(info, selection_data.type,\n+              selection_data.format, selection_data.data,\n+              selection_data.length, time_);\n+\n+      return TRUE;\n+  }\n+ \n   if (owner_window != NULL)\n     {\n       GtkWidget *owner_widget;\n\n\nA: The only answer that worked for me was given on https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/277488/288916 Radivarig (All credits go to him).

But, as you, I was frustrated that simple button mapping problem can't be solved elegantly by a software fix. Fortunately, I had the problem on my job computer, and my employer owns a variety of spare mouse controllers. It was a no cost fix! \nI think a proper mouse hardware implementation should not send random middle clicks while scrolling. Recently I found this behaviour to get annoying even while using Windows!\nNow that I've fixed the hardware bug with the proper hardware solution (change the mouse) I even started an addiction to \"paste on middle-click\" behaviour!!\nHappy linuxing!\nSincerly,\n\nA: SW:\nUbuntu 14.04, with Gnome fall back.\nHW: I have a laptop and so the middle button is actually the mouse on/in the laptop.\nSolution:\nGo to Ubuntu SW center and download Unity Tweak Tool.\nStart Tweak Tool. Under the Mouse settings it has switch to turn on/off the middle click insert.\nHave a lovely day.\n\nA: I may have a partial answer for you, if you are using a lenovo X... with \ntouchpoint/touchpad.\nThere is a \"known\" bug with the synaptics mouse buttons. If you try a USB mouse\nand have no problem, but with the touchpad/touchpoint mouse (build into the keyboard) you do have random responses that can delete swaths of text as you type, then this may be the bug I'm talking about.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1506817\nIf this fits your situation, then add your name to the list of people who have identified this bug, at that bug report. Maybe if there are many more of us reporting this, it would get fixed.\n\nA: In KDE Plasma 5.20 I had to disable both using this answer and klipper (System Tray Settings -> Disable klipper)\nNow middle-click pasting is disabled but the but button still works for closing tabs etc.\n\nA: On Kubuntu an additional step may be required to solve the problem.\nIt seems that Klipper, the clipboard manager provided by KDE, breaks the scripts that fix the behavior by clearing the clipboard selection.\nThe following will globally disable paste on middle click while retaining all middle mouse button and ctrl+c/v functionality.\nFollow the steps described in this answer, that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xbindkeys xsel xdotool\n\n\n*Place this in ~/.xbindkeysrc\n\"echo -n | xsel -n -i; pkill xbindkeys; xdotool click 2; xbindkeys\"  \nb:2 + Release\n\n\n\n*Reload xbindkeys -p\n\nIn step 2. you may need to remove the  + Release part as described in this post, depending on what works on your machine.\nSet up xbindkeys to run on startup.\nThen open Klipper, e.g. via the clipboard icon in the system tray > right click > Configure Clipboard. Uncheck the option 'Prevent empty clipboard'. Reboot and the problem should be solved.\nThe latter idea is thanks to milaq's XMousePasteBlock.\n\nA: For anyone experiencing this while using a JetBrains IDE like PyCharm/IntelliJ/Android Studio/etc - note that these IDEs actually have their OWN \"paste on middle click\" setting which you can disable in settings.\nYou may have disable middle-button BOTH in the IDE AND using whatever you find here to get it to work.\n\nA: You might want to try emulating a two button mouse. With a two button mouse you paste by clicking both mouse buttons at the same time (rather then the scroll wheel).\nInstall gpointing-device-settings:\nsudo aptitude install gpointing-device-settings\n\nhttp://live.gnome.org/GPointingDeviceSettings\nAlternately, if you do not wish to install gpointing-device-settings , and you are not bothered by command line options, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Input On this wiki page there are several command line / configuration options, choose the one you prefer.\n\nA: I tried the xinput-redirection trick, changing the center mouse \"button\" (actually a wheel) so it acts just like the left mouse button.  It still works as a wheel, and has (apparently) stopped pasting things into random places in the middle of my source code as I scroll past.\nIn my case the command was\nxinput set-button-map \"PixArt USB Optical Mouse\" 1 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n\nbut YMMV by mouse model.\n\nA: The only working solution I know is to disable copy on text selection instead:\nClone https://github.com/CyberShadow/hax11, read the docs (about NoPrimarySelection)\nBuild hax11, add preload of hax11.so using export LD_PRELOAD=<PATH_TO_HAX11.so> (see repo docs), add\nEnable=1\nNoPrimarySelection=1\n\nto ~/.config/hax11/profiles/default\nSee original answer\n\nA: did you check out gpm ? More info at http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man8/gpm.8.html. Available via sudo aptitude install gpm on lucid. I don't see the disable-paste program in the ubuntu package however, the -A option may be worth giving a try.\n\nA: It's more than a gnome feature, i think it works almost everywhere, it works in the console too, and I think it worked even in my \"Linux from Scratch\". \nSo it's really a basic feature perhaps even somewhere in the kernel.\nBTW: It's really useful, and it's not the regular paste like Ctrl + V, everything that is marked with the cursor goes in a second storage and with middleclick can paste, what you marked last.\n\nA: That's a good question, which i don't have an answer for (yet).\nA quick and dirty workaround is to remap it NOT to 0, but to 1.\nThis way, it turns middle-\"click\" to left click, and does not affect your scroller...\nIt is so far the best I can think of.\nNote:This information came from Ubuntu Forums, not my own noggin! :)\n\nA: Using what I learned in the posts above, this bash one-liner works perfectly for me...\nmouse_id=$(xinput list | grep 'Mouse' | awk '{print $9}' | sed 's/[^0-9]//g') && xinput set-button-map \"$mouse_id\" 1 0 3\n\n\nA: In KDE5, there's an option in the Control Panel to enable / disable centre-click which is disabled.\nsudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\n\nOnce you install that package and restart, the option to disable centre-click becomes available.\n\nA: Contrary to the title, the 10-year old problem seems to be really\n\nI have a sensitive mouse wheel and whenever I scroll texts, sometimes it pastes stuff randomly into the text. I lose quite a lot of credibility when I send a file to someone else that has random text snippets pasted all over it.\n\nAlso, you can't safely write programs.\nLess destructive than \"to disable the middle mouse button paste\", I see 3 possible solutions, only the first one effective so far:\n1-Exchange buttons 2 and 3\nxinput set-button-map <id> 1 3 2\n\nwhere <id> should be replaced by the mouse id as explained above by Wes Miller.\nTo make the change permanent, writte in .xprofile. (.bashrc won't work unless you use bash.)\nThus,\n\n*\n\n*if you accidentally click button 2 while scrolling, this will only open the alternate action menu, that does nothing harmful by itself,\n\n\n*last but not least, you can can still click to paste X buffer with button 3 (right).\nThe inconvenience is that you need to reverse your clicking habits, which feels like driving on the other side of the road.\n2-Find a mouse with a fourth button and remap button 2 to button 4\nHowever, I am unable to certainly identify such a mouse on the market. If you know one for sure I am interested but not a costly wired gaming mouse.\nI have tried another 3 button mouse: the wheel click is less sensitive but the problem persists.\n3-Use middle button emulation\n% xinput list-props <id>\n\nThis should return something (among others) like\nlibinput Middle Emulation Enabled (353):    0\n\nActivate middle button emulation:\nxinput set-prop 15 353 1\n\nNow, you also need to deactivate button 2.  Remapping to 0 or 25 won't work because it will also deactivate middle button emulation.  This kills solution 3.\nTested on Ubuntu 20.04.\n\nA: To solve this issue, I went to the Mouse option by searching it in the menu bar, then I saw Enable middlemouse pate and I disabled it.\n\n[NOTE]:\nI'm using Ubuntu Mate 22.04\n\n[UPDATE]:\n\n", "Q: How do I safely use a virus infected USB drive in Ubuntu? I have an USB drive which I know is virus infected (an anti-virus on my friend's machine detected it). Unfortunately neither of us know the virus name and I don't want to take the risk of plugging it to my Windows box again.\nOf course, in all probability the virus affects only Windows. (But I'm not sure)\nI want to know if I can safely plug the USB into my Ubuntu Lucid laptop and copy the stuff I need from the drive. If there are some precautions I need to follow what would they be?\n\nA: Viruses that work on Linux are rare, but they do exist. I would recommend scanning the USB volume with ClamTk (It's just called \"Virus Scanner\" in Software Center). This will help you to identify the virus, which may be useful information. You might consider re-scanning the volume after reformatting it as well. It's probably overkill, but it shouldn't take long.\n\nA: There is very little to worry about. Just copy the files you need to your laptop then format the drive. Don't copy files if you don't know what they are because these are likely to be the virus. Make sure you don't execute anything on the drive just to be safe. \n\nA: Linux systems usually do not execute code from a USB stick when just connecting it. Thus copying stuff from it should be safe.\nKeep in mind that the copied files may contain malicious code. For example, some evil java-script inside a html file or an evil office-script inside you word/open-office-writer documents. That means, you should be careful with these files - don't open these files with programs that are known to execute embedded scripting code.\nWell, and don't directly execute binary executables that are copied from that stick.\n\nA: How to \"safely\" plug in a usb drive to Linux.\nHere are my approaches. This is especially useful if you're worried about the USB \"drive\" actually being a microcontroller which identifies itself as a USB HID device like a keyboard and mouse combo and starts running commands on your computer by typing and using a mouse--same as you would. One example of this is the Hak5 \"USB Rubber Ducky. An 8-bit Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro (ATmega32U4 mcu) can be made to do this too using the USB Keyboard and Mouse libraries. Most 32-bit microcontrollers can do this too.\nSo, if that kind of stuff happens, you want to wipe your whole OS when done, and you want to be running a \"blank\" OS with nothing personal on it at the time you plug in the device. Here are some options.\n\n*\n\n*Preface notes:\n\n*\n\n*If you need the internet at any point on your \"throw-away\" OS while using the questionable thumb drive, connect only to a guest home WiFi network, which restricts access from the rest of your network. Do NOT connect to your main home WiFi network, as that would open up vulnerabilities to other systems on your network, since  being on the same wifi network as them would make their IP addresses accessable.\n\n\n\n*Option 1 (safest option I think): use a virtual machine\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu into a fresh virtual machine in Virtual Box (no cost to use), running in Ubuntu.\n\n*\n\n*ie: In Ubuntu, install Virtual Box, into which you install another Ubuntu system as a virtual machine.\n\n\n\n*In the Virtual Machine, plug in the USB drive and copy files to/from it as needed.\n\n*Reset or delete the virtual machine when done.\n\n*Note: if you need to share files between the virtual machine and your real, host computer, you can copy files to and from a shared folder that is shared between the virtual machine and your host computer.\n\n\n\n*Option 2: boot from an Ubuntu live USB which is run from RAM\n\n*\n\n*Note: if you choose this option, I recommend you have your main, internal hard drive LUKS encrypted so that even if a program tried to mount and read from or write to your internal disk, it couldn't. LUKS encryption is an option when installing Ubuntu as your main OS, for instance.\n\n*Install Ubuntu or similar to a live USB, intended to install Ubuntu.\n\n*\n\n*You can also use Parted Magic instead, for $13~$49. It's a great tool! (I'm not affiliated in any way; I just like the tool and frequently use it for computer restore and repair).\n\n\n\n*Boot from the live USB, but choose the option to \"run from RAM\" (assuming you have enough RAM).\n\n*Once the OS boots and has copied everything needed from the thumb drive to RAM, unplug your boot drive.\n\n*When done, just turning off the computer \"wipes\" the whole OS you just used, since it was all in RAM only.\n\n*Note: if you need to get files to or from the thumb drive you are plugging in, you may be opening up a security vulnerability, which is why I feel like Option 1 above is better. You could, however:\n\n*\n\n*Mount your main drive.\n\n*Plug in another USB drive.\n\n*Leave the boot drive plugged in and use it to share files.\n\n*I don't think any of these are super secure options, so do them only if you can't do Option 1 above.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*I also shared this here: Information Security: Safe to connect a USB to Linux?\n", "Q: I managed to break my ATI drivers, what should I do? Somehow, I managed to break my ATI drivers by trying to install a new driver from AMD's website.

I want something that runs on my computer that somehow interrogates X and tells me exactly the font, not a guess.\n\nA: I don't think there is a general solution. Once the text has been rendered, there's no reason why any component of the system would have kept the information of what font it was rendered from around. So you'll have to somehow watch when the program renders the text. In any case, how to get at the information depends on the rendering engine.\nMost programs render through the fontconfig library. If you start a fontconfig-using program with the FC_DEBUG environment variable set to a suitable value, it will show some information about fonts being loaded, though not what font is being used for rendering which text. Still, try running FC_DEBUG=2053 myprogram. See /usr/share/doc/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.txt.gz for the meaning of $FC_DEBUG.\nTraditional unix programs render text using bitmap fonts managed by the X server. Then you could see what font was used to render what text by spying on the X protocol conversation and watching for OpenFont, ImageText and a few other messages. I don't have ready-for-use tools to suggest.\nIf you're only interested in a particular application, there may be a better way that's specific to that application.\n\nA: A great resource for identifying fonts is here:\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\n", "Q: Movie player Totem shuts down without any error message I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 and have an issue with Movie Player Totem.

My problem is that such a hang occurs so seldom for me, that I don't remember most of the answers at that time and I have no second machine to ask the Internet while my main system hangs.\nI always remember how to open the console using some Ctrl-Alt-Fx combination. So is there a possibility to have some lines of \"intro text\" in that console, which tell me directly after switching to the console how to kill hanging processes and how to properly reboot? Think of it as a \"reminder to self\".\nDOS had the ability to change the prompt in a console to arbitrary output.

Metacity, the default window manager in GNOME (and hence the fallback when Compiz is disabled), does just the same thing.\nLooking back to your original reason for wanting to do this, one workaround would be to use the \"Windows\" key instead of Alt:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the setting at System -> Preferences -> Windows -> Movement Key\n\n\nYou can also choose to disable the feature entirely:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using Compiz, open CompizConfig Setting Manager and disable the \"Initiate Window Move\" binding for the \"Move Window plugin\".\n\n*If you're using Metacity, run gconf-editor and set /apps/metacity/general/mouse_button_modifier to be blank.\n\n\nIt seems to me, though, that the most appropriate solution would be to change Inkscape's behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Inkscape FAQ describes the modifications you will have to make to one of Inkscape's configuration files.\n\n\nA: I don't know if there is a way to disable the behaviour for a specific window, but you could change the key biding to Super + Click instead.\n", "Q: What version of Evolution will be in Maverick? I've tried Evolution 2.30.3 from Jacob's ppa on Lucid and the version of 2.30.3 in Maverick beta, they differ and both have significant shortcomings. You can't right click on an email and create a meeting, event or task, for example. Some settings don't work in the Maverick version -- (un)compress weekends in month view, for example. No alarms for events just adds to its woes.\nIf evo is not working reliably in Maverick, I'll stick with 2.28.3 in Lucid.\n\nA: According to its Launchpad page the current version in Maverick is 2.30.3.\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evolution\n(Tip: You can use any package name in Ubuntu and replace it in that URL and find that information for any given package in the archive and any supported release.)\n\nA: According to Ubuntu Packages it appears to be Evolution 2.30.3-1ubuntu3 Though as Maverick hasn't been released yet it may change - though unlikely as it's so close to release.\n", "Q: How do I turn off PCI devices? With the purchase of an Intel SSD and 85WHr Li-ion battery and the linking of wifi and bluetooth to my laptop's wireless switch, extensive Intel PowerTop usage, switching from compiz to metacity, stopping of the desktop-couch daemon, removal of Ubuntu One and several other services from my startup, disabling of everything possible in my BIOS, and physical removal of my optical drive, I've gotten my battery life up fairly high, but I think there's still more to be done.  Specifically, when I'm in class taking notes, I want to temporarily but completely power down:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ethernet\n\n*Firewire\n\n*USB ports\n\n*SD card reader\n\n*Optical drive\n\n*Webcam\n\n*Sound card\n\n*PCMCIA slot\n\n\n..without turning them off in my BIOS like they are now, if possible, because then I have to restart my computer to use any of them.  As it stands, I still haven't managed to power down:\nFirewire\nUSB connection to webcam\nsound card\nHow do I tell Linux to disable and power down these devices?  Is it true that any PCI slot can be physically powered down?\nMy current idle power consumption is 7.9 watts plus the screen.  (10.0W at min. brightness)\nAlso, how do I set the screen timeout to ten seconds?  gconf editor isn't honoring it when I set it to that.  Will switching from nVidia to Nouveau save any significant amount of power?\n\nA: Try echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/slot/$N/power for appropriate slot.\nlspci -vv may help to identify the device. This is not very well documented...\n\nA: I could be wrong (if you think I am, just leave a comment) but I always thought that things that were plugged in (or soldered on, as is the case in most laptops) are always \"on\" and available unless disabled in the BIOS.\nHowever most of these devices will only be using significant power when they're actively being used. The only real exception to this is wireless but you have a hardware switch for this. USB ports also power their plugees so you need to unplug USB things but that doesn't sound like an unreasonable request.\nYou can, of course, unload certain kernel modules which stops software having access to hardware but I doubt this would turn them off.\n", "Q: Java and ALSA problems I'm trying to use a Java-based application that requires sound in Ubuntu 10.04 using sun-java from partner repos . However, the sound is way too fast. It seems like a chipmunk got into my speakers. :)\nIs this happening to anyone else? Any ideas on how to fix it?\n\nA: As \"nhnb\" says: it seems like this bug is fixed in OpenJDK.  OpenJDK is based on the open source parts from Sun Java, with the parts that are not open source replaced by alternative code, and which apparently also fixes some bugs...\n\nA: I have similar problems using pulse audio and Java applications, except for me I get no sound for my entire system once JVM starts... but if I have an application running before JVM starts, it's sound still works.\nI run my java programs with aoss javaws /program/to/run\nThat fixes my sound, but makes the java programs crash a lot... so it's a trade off.

I've recently enabled Ubuntu's encrypted /home/ directory features and I was asked to remember a passphrase in case I would need to recover the data manually. \nWhat is the best way to store this passphrase without compromising security?\n\nA: KeePassX\nFor all the reasons cited by Decio Lira but without all the WINE overhead.\nhttp://www.keepassx.org/\n\nA: You shouldn't be using software to store the recovery passphrase for your encrypted home directory. If you store the passphrase in an application, it would get stored in your home directory and wouldn't be available when your encrypted home directory is the very thing you are trying to recover!\nWriting it down on a piece of paper, or storing it on a usb key in a physical secure location such as a safe would be the best way to store your encrypted home directory passphrase.\n\nA: I use Lastpass to store stuff like that. If you already have Lastpass, just create a secure note.\n\nA: Write it on the wall, hidden in a little corner of your house.\nBut, also, an excellent idea is to write it wherever you choose but do not write it down literally; use a mnemonic system.\nFor example, write: \"dumbest_commander+my_nr\", if your password is \"gwbush3355\" and 3355 is a number you know and remember well; or write down: \"little love+yr\", if the password is the first person you fell in love with followed by the year that happened; or write down: \"colourcitysport\", if your password is \"greencalcuttatennis\" because your favourite colour, city and sport are: green, calcutta and tennis; or write: \"pornstr + b-yr\", if you want to use your favourite pornstar's name followed by her/his birthyear as a password, etc., etc. It is up to your imagination. \nThis is good for personal use when you have many different passwords and/or don't use them very often. This is the intelligent way to do this kind of things.\n\nA: I just heard of passwordcard.org from Planet Ubuntu .. it's a pretty genius system for creating strong passwords, and saving them for later.  You essentially make a card at the site using some hexidecimal number, and you get a card full of random passwords.  You then determine a way to get a password from the card (for instance, for your encrypted partition, choose the smiley face column, blue row, all the way to the end). Check it out at passwordcard.org \n\nA: The best way to store a passphrase is to memorize it. The best way for me to store a passphrase is not to save it, so that I have to type it over and over and over. Eventually I can throw away the sticky note.\n\nA: Write it down, on a bit of paper.  Put that paper somewhere safe, like where you put your passports and important papers.\nEncryption keys should be copied onto a USB stick and put into the same place.\nI use Password Gorilla and PasswordSafe for everyday password storage and have the password to that in my brain (its complex, the only one I have to remember and used daily) and on a safe bit of paper (in case that fabled bus hits me).\n\nA: Keepass\nExcellent tool not just for passhrases, but for any login/password you have to store.\nI personally use for all my passwords for all on line services I use.\nSome of its features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Strong Security\n\n*Multiple User Keys\n\n*Portable and No Installation Required\n\n*Export To TXT, HTML, XML and CSV Files\n\n*Import From Many File Formats\n\n*Easy Database Transfer\n\n*Support of Password Groups\n\n*Time Fields and Entry Attachments\n\n*Auto-Type, Global Auto-Type Hot Key and Drag&Drop\n\n*Intuitive and Secure Clipboard Handling\n\n*Searching and Sorting\n\n*Multi-Language Support\n\n*Strong Random Password Generator\n\n*Plugin Architecture\n\n*Open Source!\n\n\nWarning\nKeepass is actually a windows app, but you can run version 1.x without problems (at least for me) with Wine or versions 2.x with the newest version of mono. See update.\nor\nyou can use the linux native KeepassX\nsudo apt-get install keepassx\n\nPersonally I prefer to use the original Keepass, since I can run it from my thumb drive on any system I have to use. But KeepassX is fine if you intend to use it only on your personal computer.\nPS: You can install Mono, KeepassX and Wine from the Software Center if don't already have them.\nUPDATE:\nAs of Ubuntu 11.04 (at least that's when I noticed), you can install Keepass 2 from the Software Center or\nsudo apt-get install keepass2\n\nA: As some others recommended here writing the password down is a good idea. However I want to add some points:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the beginning it is hard to memorise your password or passphrase. So I would suggest to often relogin during a day. This helps to memorise it.\n\n*Keep your password somewhere near you. A good idea might be your wallet. Usually not many others have access to it. Users tend to keep an eye on it. So it is a good place for »saving the passphrase«.\n\n*When you can easily remember your passphrase I would suggest to throw away your paper. Instead split it into three or more parts, write every part on a separate piece of paper and hand it out to some friends. Bonus points if the friends do not know each other. If you forget your password you can recover it.\n\n*If you own a bank safe, you can also put it there. It is safe from a »normal« burglar, but authorities and corrupt employees can get access.\n\n\nThere are other ways of storing your password. You should thing about some short term strategy until you have memorised your password. Later you should switch to some long term strategy with higher security requirements.\n", "Q: PPTP VPN on Non-Standard Port How can I run a VPN connection on a non-standard port? I have set up a VPN on my router running DD-WRT which I connected to my main router. I have forwarded the port to port 90 and can not connect to the VPN with the Network Manager. If I change the port back to 1723 (the default port) I can connect just fine. Does anybody know how to fix this?\nHere are the relevant IP addresses:\n1.1.1.1=DD-WRT Router\n192.168.1.154=IP on Internet Router\n64.7.134.78=IP\nI want it to work like this:\n1.1.1.1:1723 > 192.168.1.154:1723 > 64.7.134.78:90\n\nBut it will only work like this:\n1.1.1.1:1723 > 192.168.1.154:1723 > 64.7.134.78:1723\n\n\nA: It sounds as though you have forwarded the port to port 90 on the DD-WRT, is that correct?\nHave you checked your iptables configuraton on the DD-WRT to ensure that your packets to that port will be received? \nI don't currently know how to get Network Manager to PPTP to a specific port. I am looking into it and I will edit this answer when I find out.\nYou also might try appending the port number to the end of the IP address, like 192.168.1.1:90 for example.\nI can't find any way to induce Network Manager to send to a custom port, unless the above suggestion works. \nLooking at /usr/share/doc/pptp-linux/USING and at man pppd I don't see any way to specify a custom port either, unless, again, the method above works.\nIf it does not work, the best thing I can think of is to add a static route, defining the VPN's address range as the destination and the VPN tunnel exit address and port as the gateway.

It's a bunch of windows spatially arranged in a specific way. Of course, I could do a bunch of startup scripts to get the same effect, but it would take long to do and be difficult to manage.\nAnother reason is that one of my workspaces is a virtualized Windows OS which takes some time to load.\nAre there any drawbacks to systematically hibernating instead of powering down? All I can think of is potential memory leaks, but it doesn't seem to be a problem so far.\n\nA: Pros:\n\n\n*\n\n*Whatever you were doing prior to hibernation is still there next time you boot.\n\n*Hibernation (unlike suspend) uses no power when in hibernation.\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hibernation takes longer to boot that a normal start up (but the time savings in having all of your applications running may make this worth while).\n\n*The more RAM you use, the longer it takes to hibernate/restore. I used to use hibernation a lot in Jaunty and Karmic but Lucid uses quite a lot more RAM so hibernation takes a long time.\n\n*For hibernation to work, you need swap space >= to the amount of RAM in the machine.\n\nA: I suspend my laptop regularly (which hibernates if the battery goes too low) and rarely shut down, the only annoying thing I notice is that if you get a kernel security upgrade you need to reboot the machine to apply it, so there's a convenience/security decision to make there. \nWhen I am at home on my private network I tend to not care and leave it, but when I am travelling on someone else's network I reboot to apply the updates.\n\nA: There is a critical con to suspending in RAM or to disk, though it affects only users with sensitive data.\nSuspending (in RAM and even on disk) is advisable in a secure environment, but may be a big issue in case the computer is lost. Data can easily be recovered from RAM. Note that after resuming the suspend to disk, data are again in RAM.\nThe most critical pieces of data are the passwords and keys, that will allow to recover all other data after a normal login.\nData can be easily recovered from RAM using ieee 1394 which includes a by-design a DMA feature (!) so pluging a smartphone to the computer without loging is enough to get the data.\nThen there are more clever ways, like freezing the DRAM (and its data) and pluging it to another device to read it.\nSee: DMA attack and Freezing DRAM attack.\n\nA: There are two different suspent modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*suspend-to-ram - usually just called suspend\n\n*suspend-to-disk - usually just called hibernate\n\n\nSuspend-to-disk is usually relatively slow such that on some machines it is just faster to do a real boot.\nSuspend-to-ram leaves the RAM powered. Depending on your hardware this may consume very little energy. On most hardware the suspend/wake-up is very fast (1 - 2 seconds) and it does not consume a lot of your battery. For example on my Thinkpad it is no problem to leave it > 10 h in suspend-to-ram.\nThe only disadvantage of suspend-to-disk I can think of, is that is more difficult to setup with encrypted swap partitions.\nSure, for kernel-upgrades you have to reboot a long running system - but you have to do that in any case. And technologies like ksplice are changing that for a lot of security related patches.\nRegarding memory leaks - if you have a memory leak, it is most likely in some bad behaving application and then you can just restart that one application.\nI supend-to-ram all the time because it is so convenient to directly restart working where you left - I just reboot for security related kernel upgrades or distribution upgrades. Thus, an 'uptime' of over 100 days on my laptop is nothing special.\n\nA: I've never seen a Linux system run out of memory simply because it wasn't rebooted often enough. If you leave a mamory-leaking program running for a long time, it may eat up all your memory, but killing that program will get you back to a responsive system. There's no reason you need to reboot during the normal course of events, except for kernel updates. \n\nA: I havent experienced hibernating slower then usual startup.\nMaybe mega new computers with fast CPU but still with HDD. Then faster maybe is usual startup then needed to read from swap file- hibernated information. Also if a lot ram hibernation is slower if its used all then all whats in ram is beeing written on hibernation and more is read from swap on start.\nHibernation is good couse u can stop working nothing is lost and start compter to immidiatly continue your work.\nBut if speed is mentioned then SSD are fast so using them will make hibernation also fast and theres another technology coming ive read about 3 weeks ago but cant find in google now - New Ram witch will hibernate in Ram. Yes with still all hardware off but somehow information stored like in USB Flash drives.\nAlso about hibernation in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernation_%28computing%29\nPower saving\nAfter hibernating, the hardware is completely powered down (just like for a regular shutdown). Therefore a hibernated machine uses no more electrical power than one which is switched off -— modern machines, even if switched off, often consume a little power allowing them to be woken on an alarm timer, by Wake-on-LAN, etc. Hibernation thus allows to save electrical power, while avoiding the work associated with restoring all running programs after shutting down the computer, then switching it back on.\nHibernation is often used on laptops, which commonly have limited battery power available, and can usually be set to happen automatically on a low battery alarm. Most desktops also support hibernation, mainly as a general energy saving measure.\nHardware maintenance\nHibernation is also useful if hardware maintenance must be performed which requires powering down the hardware (e.g. changing the CPU or the Power supply). For servers which need to be started up as quickly as possible after maintenance, hibernating and resuming can be quicker than shutting down, then restarting the server applications, and will allow long-running calculations to resume instead of being restarted.\n\nA: I don't think there are any drawbacks to hibernating.\nCheck out this HowStuffWorks article for some more information.\n\nA: My machines only get rebooted for kernel updates. If that never happened my machines would constantly be going from Suspended to Unsuspended. Even when traveling - having the machine wakeup in a matter of moments - with all my applications running as I left them - is so much more efficient than having to wait the few moments it takes to boot up, login, launch applications.\n\nA: Another Pro of Hibernating against Suspend is: You can use it during flights, while I guess that suspend is against flight regulation (send me a comment if not).\n", "Q: How can I cache NFS shares on a local disk? I use NFS to share media to computers around my house. Unfortunately one of the machines is on a slow wireless link, is there a way to cache network shares on the local disk for performance?\n\nA: Stefan led me down the right track. This will work on any system 12.04 and newer. \nYour filesystem will also need extended attribute support. If you're using EXT4 you're fine, if you're using EXT3 you'll need to ensure your filesystem is mounted with the user_xattr attribute.\nHere's how I set it  up on the client machine, you don't need to do anything on the server side.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, install the user space daemon:\nsudo apt-get install cachefilesd\n\n*Then turn it on by editing /etc/default/cachefilesd and changing the run line to RUN=yes\n\n*Ensure your NFS mount in /etc/fstab has an fsc option. Don't forget to remount it after you've made the changes.

Basically with LAMP and then setting up WordPress and most likely Drupal. I also plan to experiment with setting up a home intranet. This system will not be serving over the Internet.\nMy desktop has a fairly standard /, swap, /home partitioning scheme. Would this be an adequate scheme for the server as well? Or would it be beneficial to do something fancy like creating separate partitions for /usr, /var, /tmp, and /home? \nI'll probably wind up doing things like corrupting MySQL and having to start over while on my learning curve. Also, I have 2 drives and plan on setting up with software RAID0 if that matters. \nThanks.\n\nA: For a production system it can be a good idea to put directories that can fill up quickly on  their own partitions, like /tmp/ or parts of /var. \nSometimes you want to use different file systems or file systems with different parameters for some directories, like big mail or news spools which hold very much small files.\nIf /usr is on its own partition it can be mounted read-only so it doesn't get corrupted at  system crashes.\nFor a learning system this things aren't needed - but maybe it's something you want to play with.\n\nA: I think from your standpoint there would be no real benefit to creating more partitions outside of your standard partitioning scheme.  Your not going to be overloading the system or mapping core directories to nfs shares or seperate drives, so I don't see any benefit to it.\n", "Q: Computer Hangs Even Before GRUB is Reached Last night I was trying to make it so my iPod Touch would interface with my Kubuntu machine, and somehow I ended up doing something very, very wrong. Now, whenever the computer starts up, before GRUB even loads, I get a few strange error messages:\n[drm] Nouveau - Couldn't find matching output script table.\nGPU Lockup\n\n(Those aren't the exact errors, I had to shorthand transcribe the gist). Not only do those errors (and others that are mostly identical) occur, but part of the way through the boot process my screen turns to this (and is afterward useless until the power is hard-reset :/):\n\nDoes anybody have any idea as to what I did? I've been trying all day to get anything working using a Xubuntu LiveCD, but to no avail. I even erased all of my data trying to perform a clean install from the disc.\n\nA: Since the computer hangs before Grub is reached, you don't have an Ubuntu problem, you have a hardware or firmware problem. Specifically, the problem is in a component related to your graphics chip, perhaps the chip itself, or its heatsink, or a circuit leading to it, or the memory containing its firmware, or the firmware code itself, or …\nIf the hosed display wasn't enough of a cue, the error message you quote points to the same component: Nouveau is a driver for NVidia graphics chips, and “GPU lockup” means your graphics processing unit crashed. This error message is coming from Linux, but not from Ubuntu: it's from ExpressGate, which is an appliance Linux distribution available on high-end Asus motherboards.\nTry powering off the laptop completely; unplug it and pull out the battery, then wait a couple of minutes and try booting. Another thing that has a tiny but nonzero chance of working is to do a BIOS upgrade (even if it's to a version you already have).\nIf the fault is in the hardware rather than in the software, there's not much you can do unless you're comfortable tinkering inside laptops (and perhaps not even then). If the computer is still under warranty, have it repaired or exchanged. If you'd like to save your data and erase the disk, take it out and plug it into another computer using a SATA to USB adapter.\n", "Q: NTFS backup image won't mount I made an image of my NTFS partition before I formatted, but now it won't mount.

I just noticed that ubuntu one is available for Windows if you subscribe.\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/plans/\nWhy is it limited? \nIt would be great advertising, and help the migration.\n\nA: The Windows client referred to on the plans page is for syncing contacts. We charge for this because the client is part of mobile sync and mobile sync costs some money to provide due to licensing fees Canonical pays for some of the server technology.\nWe are currently working on a Windows client for Ubuntu One that will allow you to sync files.

(it says wireless disabled)\nI installed ubuntu side by side with an already existing windows XP, on windows wireless works fine.\nI tried both ubuntu desktop edition and netbook remix, but same problem on these two modes.\nIt happens both when I run ubuntu from the USB and when it's installed on the hard-drive.\nI found many articles about the broadcom network card issues this netbook has, but they all suggest to run: \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo reboot\n\n(e.g. this official guide)\nhowever this doesn't seem to solve my problem.\n\nA: Let me mention the simple answer that you have probably tried for future seekers. This has worked for me on my last two installs involving broadcom wireless drivers. It does however require a wired connection.  \nStart up  System > Administration > Hardware Drivers\nLet it build the database, then see if there is a Broadcom driver available that just needs to be \"activated\". If so do it and see if it works.  \nOn previous versions I always got them working using a variety of complex fixes and commands. I've been pleased that the method listed here has worked very well recently.\n\nA: I had this problem just two days ago.\nhttp://www.broadcom.com/docs/linux_sta/README.txt\nFirst check you have the affected card:\nsudo lspci -n | grep 14e4\n\nThen check that you have the modules that are breaking your installation:\nsudo lsmod  | grep \"b43\\|ssb\\|wl\"\n\n(b43 and ssb are the offenders)\nThen edit the kernel module blacklist file:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf \n\nand add the following to the end:\nblacklist ssb\nblacklist b43\n\nI then rebooted, re-ran the Additional Hardware tool (in the Administration menu) and it installed correctly and worked perfectly.\n\nA: You need to figure out which wireless card you have, and then let us know which one you have.\nI am quite sure it is Broadcom, but we need to know which chipset.\nThat info can be found by typing lspci|grep Network in a terminal. No need to use sudo or anything.\n\nA: Is the wireless on? If not, hold the \"A\" button (on the left) and press On (+).

On the unlock password screen there is a button so that someone can leave a message.  Is this a case of somehow a blank message got left?\n\nA: this is exactly the intended behavior.\nIt is there just in case someone needed you (or your computer) \"while you were out\". This way, they can leave you a message, without breaching into your computer for that.\nSay you went to the restroom, and a co-worker wanted to have you look-up something for them, this way, they can just leave you a message and let you know without having to track you down or leave it on a post-it (which may not be available).\nThe only problem here is maybe we should have the devs add a title bar or other such information to the message that will let the user know it is a \"while you were out\" message, as opposed to just \"something from gnome-screensaver\".\n", "Q: How can I play content from a media server?

Then you can configure cups on your downstairs computer to publish the connected printer. The cups daemon on you upstairs computer then automatically sees the published printer and you can select it from the usual printer dialog.\nYou can configure cups via the web-interace, i.e. you can connect to http://127.0.0.1:631 (on the computer with the printer.\nThe automatically discovering of the shared printer on the printer-less computer only works, if both computers are on the same subnet and if the computer has the show-broadcasted-printers-option in cups enabled.

Is there a GUI utility to mount remote filesystems over SSH (SSHFS)?\n\nA: Gigolo\nGigolo is a front-end to easily manage connections to remote filesystems using GIO/GVfs. It allows you to quickly connect/mount a remote filesystem and manage bookmarks of such.\nTo install Gigolo in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install gigolo\n\n\nA: It's not clear to me if you are strictly bound to using sshfs, but by default the GVFS in GNOME supports SSH connections. In the file manager go to File -> Connect to server:\n\nThis will mount the remote SSH server in a folder you can access from the file manager. If you need to access the mount in the command line it's in .gvfs.\nYou can also mount it in Nautilus. Just hit CTRL+L and in the address bar type: ssh://server-ip/somepath/\n\n\n*\n\n*Where is \"Connect to Server\" for ssh connections in Unity?\n\nA: If you just need to access the remote filesystem, you should be able to go to sftp://hostname.example.com in your file browser without having to mount it.\n\nA: Nautilus can do it:\nFile-->Connect to a server\n", "Q: \"Gnome Do\" stops working After one or two times I use Gnome Do, it stops working.  Yet it does not give out an error message.  I currently have it configured to pop up when with then Super + Space key combination.  I have to constantly go to the menu and activate it again.\n\nA: If you don't like the idea of running Gnome-do from the terminal, one way to figure out what is happening is to start it as gnome-do > ~/.dolog.txt and read that file when do crashes.\nWhat this does it divert the output of gnome-do (read the debugging information) to the file dolog.txt. This file will be found in your home directory, as in /home/username/dolog.txt\nYou may file a bug against gnome-do with that file on Launchpad to help fix it.\nI am also having some problems with gnome-do crashing that way as well, and maybe with all of our inputs, the devs will be able to solve them.\nAs far as your other problem, which is restarting gnome-do once it crashes, you can always try this workaround that I found quite helpful:\nAssign a shortcut key to restarting gnome-do, such as Ctrl+Shift+Space and use that instead to relaunch it.\nAn easy way would be to launch gconf-editor\nthen navigate to apps->metacity->global_keybindings and assign the value <Control><Shift><Space> to run_command_1\nand then go to apps->metacity->keybinding_commands and type exec gnome-do > ~/dolog.txt as the value of command_1\nNow when gnome-do crashes, you will have an easy way to restart it (Ctrl+Shift+Space) instead of going into the menu again...\nAnd since that shortcut is so close to the original shortcut for summoning gnome-do in the first place, it has the added advantage of being easy to remember!\n\nA: I had the same problem, and after running the \ngnome-do > ./dolog.txt\n\nsuggested by Tiede, I got the following error\n=================================================================\nGot a SIGABRT while executing native code. This usually indicates\na fatal error in the mono runtime or one of the native libraries \nused by your application.\n=================================================================\n\ngoogling 'SIGABRT gnome-do mono' gives some background, and reinstalling mono seems to be the key. The following worked for me:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall mono-2.0-gac mono-gac mono-runtime\n\n\nA: If you've just upgraded to a new version of Ubuntu, and you're now having problems with Gnome-Do in dock mode, from personal experience I'd suggest reinstalling Do.

It works fine when I select one photo at a time. When I select more than one it does not upload the photos into my facebook photo album. I tried loading multiple photos from F-Spot onto facebook but have a similar experience. In both instances it only loads one photo at a time which is extremely time consuming.\n\nA: Shotwell on Maverick does it auto-magically. Just select your photos, click on Publish, select Facebook and done.\nI have found a PPA that will let you install Shotwell 0.72 (Maverick's version) in Lucid.\n\nA: Someone has created a script that let Nautilus update a bunch of pictures to Facebook. There is small article in OMG! Ubuntu about it.\n\nA: It's not completely clear /how/ you're uploading the files.  Facebook has a Java-based uploader which allows you to not only specify multiple files, but will also locally scale them down before upload for a quick process.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Java is installed (sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre and make sure you have the \"partner\" respository ticked).\n\n*Go to facebook, login.\n\n*Click \"Profile\"\n\n*Scroll down on till you see the \"photos\" box on the left pane.

According to the developer it is not yet ported to linux.\nHowever, I ran into a thread on the Ubuntu forums about using Picasa and Internet Explorer under the same WINE root in order to take advantage of the Picasa Facebook uploader. I haven't tried it yet and the thread is a year old. May be worth taking a look at. \nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1093761.html\n\nA: I use digiKam (a KDE app, though I use Gnome) and under the Export menu you can export to a dozen or so websites, including facebook.

So, I've been having trouble finding a definitive answer on how to do this.  I've compiled and installed a window manager that is not available in the ubuntu package repositories, and now I'm attempting to add it to the gdm options menu.  What's the \"Ubuntu\" way to do this?  I'm sure there must be a 'most correct' approach.  Anyone have any clues, or links to websites?  I've seen a few answers in the ubuntu forums, but no-one really had a clear, \"This is the right way to do it\" that I found. \n\nA: By gdm options menu, do you mean the list at the bottom of the login screen ?\nIf yes, then, as far as I know, the \"correct approach\" for adding a window manager to the list of session options presented to user at login time is to add a .desktop file to /usr/share/xsessions. Take an existing .desktop file there as starting point (say, gnome.desktop) and modify fields like Exec, TryExec, Icon to suit your new WM.  \nSince this is so obvious (by that I mean covered in the tutorials of many WM's I have tried to add), I think I haven't understood your question well.

When inserted, two items appear in Places -> Computer:\n\n\"SanDisk Ultra Backup: 16GB\" contains my data, and \"CD Drive: U3 System\" contains a Windows executable. The part with the Windows executable doesn't look useful to me so I'd like to remove it. I used GParted to delete the only partition listed on the device and then I created and formatted a new partition:\n\nStrangely, the \"CD Drive\" containing the Windows executable was perfectly intact after this operation.\nWhat's going on?\n\nA: U3 is proprietary software that SanDisk loads on it's USB drive. It runs in a partition you can't reformat, or really detect, and it'll likely always be there.\nIf you have a Windows machine you can run the Un-installer using the guide in the SanDisk KB.\n\nA: The solution came from u3_tool (universe), which can:\n\n\n*\n\n*uninstall the U3 software\n\n*reclaim the CD-ROM disk space\n\n*run on Ubuntu\n\n\nI ran sudo u3-tool -p 0 /dev/sdb and then repartitioned the drive.

When I installed Arch Linux, it detected my video card and monitors correctly \"out-of-the box\". Now I've installed Ubuntu 10.10 \"Maverick Meerkat\" and it has not. \nHow do I configure Ubuntu to use correct Intel driers with a \"Intel 82852/855GM\" graphics card? \n(I use a Toshiba L10 Intel Centrino laptop.)\n\nA: I have also struggled with Toshiba laptops and the 855GM chipset. I've been able to overcome this with the following PPA. This will provide an updated version of xserver-xorg-video-intel that may provide better results than what you currently have. \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:glasen/intel-driver\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf you don't receive updates to the xserver-xorg-video-intel then run \nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\nMore information regarding PPAs and How to use them\n\nA: The Intel i855 (along with the i830 and i845) chips have suffered serious stability regressions since the implementation of DRI2 (and the associated GEM kernel work) in the driver.  These features have stressed parts of the hardware that haven't previously been heavily used in the past, and turn out to have hardware bugs.\nThus, in Ubuntu 10.04 we turned off KMS for these cards.  That didn't help enough, and many users still reported frequent system crashes - from X just not coming up, to the system hanging whenever they tried to play a video, to apparently random freezes every couple of days.\nIn Maverick we've just disabled the autoloader for the Intel driver on these cards.  That should give a baseline stable experience for users of these cards, dropping back to fbdev.\nSee this page for details of how to use the Intel driver (and possibly sacrifice stability).\nUpdate: The Intel driver will be autoloaded in the upcoming Ubuntu 11.10 release, as upstream has (apparently!) worked around the issues that this hardware has.\n\nA: Get rid of your Intel card. Save the money because stealing isn't nice. Then the problem will go away. Don't fight this one. The Intel card is a disaster. (I now use a nvidia gigabyte geforce 210. It's fine. I used to have a 945G Intel chipset).\n", "Q: How to configure a second IP address and bind it to a VBoxHeadless virtual machine? I've requested my ISP to dedicate me a second Internet IP address and have got it. Now I need to configure it (I've never had any experience with using multiple IP addresses on one network interface) on my Ubuntu 10.04 server so that it will be a public address of a VirtualBox (VBoxHeadless) machine (running Ubuntu 10.04 Server as well). Would you be so kind to tell me how can I do so, or at least what docs to read and what specific subjects to google for?\n\nA: The easiest way would be to set the virtual machine to use ‘bridged’ networking on the host's normal eth0 interface. Then set up the guest OS to use the second IP address as a static IP, whilst the host OS continues to the the first static IP.\nWith this approach, you don't have to set up multiple interfaces on the host OS or NAT rules to map the guest to a particular external IP. The guest and the host use different interfaces on the same shared network adapter.\n\nA: Just to add, in my case (strato.nl) I had to set the same MAC address in the guess as the one in the host, also check the route configuration of the host. \n", "Q: logical partition or primary partition Today I was setting up an ubuntu server and while partitioning for RAID0 I wound up setting /home as a logical partition. Basically the partitioner defaulted to that option and I hit return and the system was off on the installation.\nAnyway, does it matter that /home is a logical partition instead of a primary partition?\n\nA: No it does not matter. Logical partitions allow you to have many partitions instead of a limit of 4 with MBR. Example:\n\n[part1 windows C][part2 windows\n  D][part3 Data][part4 Ubuntu LOGICAL -\n  Part 5,6,7 (/, Swap, and /home)]\n\nThere will be no difference.

As Ubuntu 10.10 seems to neither detect my graphics card (Intel 82852/855GM) automatically nor use the corresponding Intel driver even after manually installing it, I am looking into manually configuring X (shouldn't I?). Where can I find the configuration files I need to edit?\n\nA: The xorg.conf does not exist by default any more. You CAN create one though.\nBoot into recovery mode and select Root Shell. Then run:\nX -configure\n\nThen:\ncp /root/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nReboot and you can edit the new Xorg.conf.\n\nA: The configurations files are at /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d \nThey are: \n10-evdev.conf \n11-evdev-quirks.conf \n50-vmmouse.conf\n50-wacom.conf \n51-synaptics-quirks.conf\nCheck the current manual.\nIf you create a xorg.conf file the configurations of this file will prevail.\nAlso check this answer. \n\nA: Usually, you don't need the xorg.conf any more. \nIf you need to configure some devices anyway, you can do so by placing a file in the /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d/ (Ubuntu 10.04) or /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ (since Ubuntu 10.10). There are some files in this directory already. \nYou can find more information on xorg.conf.d (in german, but the configuration files are in english of course). What is important is that the filenames should start with a two-digit number greater than 10.\nAnother guide - in english - is on x org archive. It's still using /usr/lib but it's good.\n\nA: cookiecaper's suggestion to use \nsudo X :1 -configure\n\nworked for me - right from the desktop!

What are correct places for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Global environment variables meant to affect all users?\n\n*User-specific environment variables?\n\n\nA: To add to sagarchalise's answer, I can summarize what the link suggests as appropriate places for settings.  \nFor global settings, system-wide environment variables\n\n\n*\n\n*Use /etc/environment \n\n*Don't use /etc/profile or /etc/bash.bashrc\nFrom the page:\n\n/etc/environment [...] is\n  specifically meant for system-wide\n  environment variable settings. It is\n  not a script file, but rather consists\n  of assignment expressions, one per\n  line. Specifically, this file stores\n  the system-wide locale and path\n  settings.\n\nUsing /etc/profile is a very Unix-y way to go, but its functionality is greatly reduced under Ubuntu. It exists only to point to /etc/bash.bashrc and to collect entries from /etc/profile.d. \nOn my system, the only interesting entry entry in profile.d is /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh.\nFor local or per-user settings\nThe Ubuntu page recommends ~/.pam_environment, which is loaded by the PAM system when your session is started (TTY, GUI, SSH, etc.). It is the user-equivalent of /etc/environment and uses the same syntax. The link suggests alternatives if that doesn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.profile for most shells. This file may also be applied to your GUI session by the display manager, but this need not be the case for all display managers or display servers (X11 vs Wayland) or sessions.\n\n\nAnd bash-specific:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bash_profile or ~./bash_login - If one of these exists, bash executes it instead of ~/.profile when bash is started as a login shell. Bash will prefer ~/.bash_profile to  ~/.bash_login. [...] These files won't influence a graphical session by default.\"\n\n*~/.bashrc - \"... may be the easiest place to set variables\". \n\n\nA: You've got:\n\n/etc/profile: system-wide .profile file for the Bourne shell (sh(1))\n  and Bourne compatible shells (bash(1), ksh(1), ash(1), ...).  \n\nwhich in Lucid and Maverick run\n/etc/profile.d/*.sh\n\nif present, and if the user's shell is bash:\n/etc/bash.bashrc\n\nFor user environment, there is a confusing array specific to the shell and whether it is considered a \"login shell\". If the shell is bash:\n   ~/.bash_profile\n          The personal initialization file, executed for login shells\n   ~/.bashrc\n          The individual per-interactive-shell startup file\n\nfor sh/dash:\n$HOME/.profile\n\nfor zsh, I'm not even going to try to make sense of this.\n\nA: As recommended on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables:\n\n*\n\n*Global environment variables meant to affect all users should go in /etc/environment.\n\n\n*User-specific environment variables should be set in ~/.pam_environment.\nAvoid the profile and rc files for setting environment variables on Ubuntu.  They have caused me more headaches than they are worth.\nThis is easier said than done however ;)\nIt is possible that you may run into the same configuration gap that existed for me.  See the workaround for encrypted home below.\nMy ~/.pam_environment:\nPATH            DEFAULT=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:${HOME}/bin\nIDEA_JDK        DEFAULT=${HOME}/Applications/jdk\n\nWhy the ugly static path? ${PATH} would not work for me. I bricked my login several times trying to work around it so I am sticking with the ugly static copy of the defaults :)\nWorkaround for Encrypted Home Folders\nIn Ubuntu releases up to and including Precise 12.04 Beta 2, if you are using an encrypted home directory you will need to modify /etc/pam.d/common-session to get it to load ~/.pam_environment.  This solution apparently works for earlier releases, but I have not tested it.\nGuenther Montag (g-montag) wrote on 2010-08-19:\n\nThis seems to be an issue with encrypted home directories. I added\nsession required pam_env.so\nat the end of /etc/pam.d/common-session and now ~/.pam_environment gets read. On another system without encrypted home directories (also 10.04) the work around is not needed. Perhaps in my case the system tries to read ~/.pam_environment before it is decrypted.\n\nAdapted from my answer on Super User: https://superuser.com/a/408373/66856\n\nA: I think the community wiki page on environment variables will help you sort out\n", "Q: How to get default /usr/share/vim folder back?

I do my coding work on an Ubuntu machine at work, but I keep a laptop running windows with outlook for the corporate email.  I don't really want to fight with Evolution and get it to work with the corporate setup, but I'd like something that could let me know on the Ubuntu machine if I got a new email in outlook/exchange.  Does such a thing exist?\n\nA: Short of a one-shot tool doing exactly what you want, I can recommend a 2-part approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*davmail can help you connect to exchange server from Ubuntu (via Outlook web access or EWS)\n\n*\n\n*Install using the .deb available on the sourceforge site.\n\n*Follow the steps in Linux Setup and Getting Started pages to have davmail present an \"IMAP interface to your exchange email\". You would only need to configure IMAP port (un-check other things, unless you'd like to further experiment accessing email & calendar information via a linux client like Thunderbird)\n\n\n*Conky can display unread messages on an imap inbox at any convenient location on your desktop. Alternatively, you can try Popper\nBTW, once you are past the (easy) configuration of davmail, you could access your outlook email from either Thunderbird or Evolution as if it were on a local IMAP server. Thunderbird setup instructions are available at the davmail site.\n\nA: Just to clarify for anyone who is confused by the instructions at the DavMail site, when you configure DavMail be sure to use the login and password for your account on the Exchange server, not on your machine at home.\nAlso, an easy way to display the mail count and subjects in Conky is to use Kaivalagi's conkyEmailscript.  Set the server to localhost and add the port number tag.\nExample from my conkyrc:\n${color6}${font LCDMono:style=regular:size=10} Exchange Server: ${color7}${font}${execi 600 conkyEmail  **--port=1143** --servertype=IMAP **--servername=localhost** --username=my-exchange-user-name --password=my-exchange-password --mailinfo=5}${font}\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to run a script every time I connect to a specifc wireless network? There is a specific wireless network I connect to that requires me to use vpnc to access the internet. If I make a script to do this, is there a way to set it up so every time I connect to this network, the script is run? To be clear, I don't want this script run with most wireless connections, just one specific one.\n\nA: You can use upstart for this. Upstart is able to catch the event of connecting to a wireless network (or a network in general) and use that as the prerequisite for running your script.\nUpstart is already used by lots of scripts in Ubuntu and will eventually replace all the System V init scripts at bootup time.\n\nA: Network Manager runs ALL of the scripts in the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ directory (those owned by root, that are executable, that are not readable by other users, and not setuid).\nEnvironment variables are set and passed to this script by Network manager. You'll be interested in the CONNECTION_UUID environment variable (contains a unique string).\nSo, to solve your problem (execute a script when a particular wireless network is connected to):\n1) find out the uuid of the wireless connection you're interested in (by looking inside the appropriate connection file in the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ directory).\n2) write a bash (or perl, or python, or whatever) script that does what you want if the environment variable CONNECTION_UUID is a match to the uuid of the wireless network in (1) above.\n3) put this script into /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ and set the owner and permissions appropriately.\nfurther reading: man networkmanager ( and a litte poking around the scripts in the directories mentioned above).\n", "Q: How to log out without having to confirm?

As far as I can remember, on some of even pretty old cellphones it was possible to say a name to be dialled. From this I conclude that it is possible and not very complex to implement. So, do such a system exist, which listens to voice commands, converts them to console commands according to a predefined map and executes?\n\nA: http://sourceforge.net/projects/speech2text/\nAs i know it features and language to develop own modules.\nYou should give it a try.\n\nA: Gnome Voice Control:\nhttp://live.gnome.org/GnomeVoiceControl \nsudo apt-get install gnome-voice-control\n\nprovides voice control for the GNOME desktop, but I have not been able to find any such system for the console.\nAlso, GNOME apparently did not feel the need to include any documentation on the above site, so who knows what the thing actually does. Sure dev team, I'd love to spend some hours wading through your code to figure out how to use your applet. [/rant]\nOoh, even better! I installed the applet and added it to my panel. Right-click menu has a Help option. \"Great!\" thinks I. \"Now I can find out how it works.\"\nHere's the text of the help page:\n\nThe Voice Control Applet allows you to control desktop\n        with voice.

I was working on developing my command line skills last night and ran into an issue where when I used sudo, I got an error message that said 'permission denied'. However when I used 'sudo su' and became root the command worked. \nWhy didn't sudo work in the first instance?\nIt was:\n$ sudo cat > /var/www/info. php\n<?php\nphpinfo( ) ;\n? >\n^D\n\nFrom the Linux Bible 2010 edition in the section on setting up a LAMP server.\n\nA: sudo does not work for commands that need permissions to write a file, such as:\nsudo echo \"vm.swappines = 100\" >> /etc/sysctl.conf\nIt explains in the sudo man-page.\n\nA: The problem is that the \"> foo.txt\" part is interpreted and executed by your command interpreter (shell) long before the sudo command is being run.  The sudo command has no idea that you want to redirect its output to a file.\nYour command interpreter does not have root authority (but the sudo command will eventually later) so it cannot redirect the output to foo.txt. \n\nA: The <, > and >> are used for input / output redirection for commands - which is a feature provided by the shell (e.g., bash). So if you type a command like sudo cat > /var/www/info.php then the shell that receives this as input tries to open the file /var/www/info.php and provides that file as the standard output to the sudo command. The sudo command is not even aware whether its output is going to a console or redirected to a file, because this is taken care of by the shell that invokes it.\nIf the shell you typed your command into is your login shell or another shell running in a terminal with your user id, then it has same privileges as your user id - not those of root.\nSo in your case, whereas the cat command is executed as root, the copying of its output to /var/www/info.php is attempted by the shell running as a normal user, which, as expected, fails.\nA workaround for such situations is to use the tee command :\nsudo tee /var/www/info.php\n\nThat will have the intended effect of putting all the text entered at the console upto ^D into the file specified as parameter.\nOne perhaps undersirable side-effect is that tee will also echo the output to the stdout, so after you type each line and press enter tee will output a copy of it back. To avoid this you can use the following variant.\nsudo tee /var/www/info.php > /dev/null\n\nDetails about tee can be had via info tee at a terminal.\n\nA: Another way to solve this is to start a subshell with sudo and execute that command in that subshell:\n$ sudo bash -c \"cat > /var/www/info.php\"\n<?php\nphpinfo( ) ;\n? >\n^D\n\nhere, the command that \"has sudo\" is bash, and anything executed in it has root permissions.\n$2c,\n*-pike\n", "Q: I am using Edgy Eft (6.10).

Upgrading to a later version of Ubuntu shouldn't ever degrade performance (that's my opinion, not reality), and can be made to run fine on older hardware with a little tweaking. I run 10.04 and 10.10 on my laptop with 1GB RAM and a 1.2GHz 32-bit processor without problems. \nThere are certain applications (such as Gwibber) which I have heard have adverse impact on system performance. I don't use Gwibber and I have removed it from my desktop system. It runs on the laptop (idle, since I don't use it) without impact. I remember hearing complaints about Gwibber when 10.04 came out, but not so much since then- perhaps the issue has been resolved with an update.\nIf you go ahead and install 10.04 and notice a drop in performance relative to 6.10, I recommend firing up System Monitor and seeing if you can find an application hogging up resources. \n\nA: It's very hard to predict. Ubuntu makes some effort to streamline common tasks, giving an advantage to newer releases. But most applications gain features a lot faster than they are optimized, which gives an advantage to older releases. A newer release is likely to come with a default configuration tuned for a faster machine (especially in terms of display effects), but you can change the configuration.\nLooking at your specs, you have a relatively slow CPU, but a more than adequate amount of RAM, so it's worth a try.\nAnother factor which is strongly in favor of 10.04+ is the ext4 filesystem, which is a lot faster than ext3. It can make a significant difference to anything involving file input/output.\nOne specific task which can benefit from a newer release is web browsing: 10.04 ships with Chromium (it's not the default browser, but it is part of the distribution), and Chromium is usually visibly faster than Firefox. (I don't know if Chromium works on edgy — it's available for hardy, but considering that Chromium uses a lot of libraries, including some from Gnome, edgy is pushing it.)\n\nA: You'll really notice the improved boot time.\n\nA: In my opinion, switching from 6.10 to 10.04 per se may not affect performance. However, the increased UI polish and graphical goodness brought into GNOME desktop could demand more from the hardware. \nI would suggest trying xubuntu or lubuntu first preferable via a live cd/ live usb.\n\nA: CPU does not really mean much to Ubuntu's performance. (Not at least getting things done, it will for tasks that are CPU bound like encoding obviously). With over 1gb of RAM it will run speedy. I can get away with less than half of what you have.\nTry a live CD and see if everything works for you. If it feels fast even off the slow live CD, then it will run great. :)\n\nA: I have 10.04 on a 1.7 GHz P4 and it never consumes more than 50% of the CPU.RAM usage is a little but high though(but i have 512 MB RAM only :( ).\n", "Q: What are benefits of aptitude compared to apt-get? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs aptitude really better than apt-get? \n\nTo install a package I can \"apt-get install\" or \"aptitude install\", to search - \"apt-cache search\" or \"aptitude search\".

You get the text below if you run getweb (without arguments) in a terminal. \nConvenience script to get extra somethings from the web, such as ICC color profiles, firmware, PPD files, etc.\n", "Q: How can I find which command is bound to a given keyboard shortcut? How can I find which command is bound to a give keyboard shortcut? I remember playing with my keyboard shortcuts recently in different places: System/Preferences/Keyboard Shortcuts, \"gnome-keyboard-properties\" and Compiz. Is there a central place where all those shortcuts are kept or do I have to remember all the places where I set a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: No, there's no central place.  Any application can grab certain keys and use them as shortcuts, and it's up to that application to choose a configuration method.  GNOME applications typically use gconf.  Compiz and Metacity even share the gconf keys -- those are the shortcuts you can see in gnome-keybinding-properties.\n\nA: The best place I've found is to use gconf. Hit F2 for a run box and type in gconf-editor, then browse to apps > metacity > global_keybindings. You can also set up custom commands in the keybinding_commands section and call them up there. Example:\nFor keybinding command command_1 I put in \"gnome-screensaver-command --activate\" without the quotes.\nThen for global keybinding run_command_1 I put in \"s\" also without quotes. Whenever I use that key command I activate the screensaver.\n", "Q: How can I get my microphone to work in a virtualbox windows xp guest? I have been trying to get this to work for several days. I have googled until I can't google anymore.....\nI have Ubuntu 10.04 64 bit with Virtualbox Ver. 3.2.8 installed. I have a windows xp pro guest. I am running Rosettas stone in the guest.

I'm upgrading my laptop to Maverick (10.10) and I noticed btrfs is an option for the filesystem. I read a while ago that the Ubuntu team weren't sure if it was going to be stable for Maverick. Does anyone know (with references) if it was approved for stable use? Any other pros and cons?\nFor the moment I've made my root partition ext4 and my home partition btrfs, but I could reinstall. My laptop is a secondary computer.\n\nA: It is not considered stable.\nPeople are usually conservative when it comes to new filesystems. You don't want to lose data, right?\nIf your data under /home is not important to you, brtfs is a good fs choice right now.\n\nA: I've done a bit of googling about this since asking the question and found:\n\n\n*\n\n*there is currently no fsck for btrfs (as of linux kernel 2.6.36, while maverick has 2.6.35), so \"it's rather easy to kill a btrfs by just losing power\".\n\n*the btrfs launchpad blueprint has the comment \" I deferred this for completion in Natty, as we won't be able to complete all the remaining work for Maverick\".\n\n*there is an open bug about dpkg upgrades and installs being very slow on btrfs.\n\n\nSo all these would suggest btrfs should not be used on a production system, or any other system where you care about the data.\n\nA: Main point against btrfs being called stable anywhere: The on-disk format is not fixed yet and could be changed anytime, which would require the user to reformat his or her disks.\n\nA: main problem is that a kernel oops or power loss can corrupt the partition, and btrfsck is not currently able to repair filesystems, although it can recognise faults.\n\nA: Btrfs is plenty stable and has caused me no problems. \nPeople have very widely varying personal risk tolerances for filesystems. to many enterprise-oriented syaadmins a FS must prove it's self for a decade before being blessed stable and others get a thrill from running the latest experimental cluster filesystem. Btrfs is very unlikely to loose your data, though some of the advanced features (like raid5/6) wont work yet. Some of the people that consider btrfs unstable also consider new things like ext4 unstable also. \n\nA: *\n\n*In 2019 it is rock solid!\nI cloned both trans-disk and intra-disk, checked, balanced, removed subvols etc. without any problems.\n", "Q: What is the best way to launch a process when the Internet connection goes up/down?

I doubt it is correct to place public websites to /home/administrator/public_html/. What is the correct place? I am going to use Apache's Name-based Virtual Host Support to host multiple websites.\n\nA: That depends a lot on what you think is good.\nPersonally i have two lamp's running several sites and they use the following setup:\n/var/www/domain.tld/subdomaine\n/var/www/domain.tld/subdomaine-log\n\nReal life example:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerAdmin hostmaster@sourcelab.dk\n    ServerName sourcelab.dk\n    ServerAlias www.sourcelab.dk *.sourcelab.dk\n\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/sourcelab.dk/www\n    <Directory />\n            Options FollowSymLinks\n            AllowOverride None\n    </Directory>\n\n    <Directory /var/www/sourcelab.dk/www>\n            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n            AllowOverride All\n            Order allow,deny\n            allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\n    ErrorLog /var/www/sourcelab.dk/www-log/error.log\n\n    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,\n    # alert, emerg.\n    LogLevel warn\n\n    CustomLog /var/www/sourcelab.dk/www-log/access.log combined\n    ServerSignature On\n</VirtualHost>\n\nIf you use this setup it might be a good idea to alter /etc/logrotate.d/apache2 just prepend lines like this \"/var/www/sourcelab.dk/www-log/*.log\" to the file.\n/var/www/sourcelab.dk/www-log/*.log\n/var/log/apache2/*.log {\n    weekly\n    missingok\n    rotate 52\n    compress\n    delaycompress\n    notifempty\n    create 640 root adm\n    sharedscripts\n    postrotate\n            if [ -f \"`. /etc/apache2/envvars ; echo ${APACHE_PID_FILE:-/var/run/apache2.pid}`\" ]; then\n                    /etc/init.d/apache2 reload > /dev/null\n            fi\n    endscript\n}\n\nThis will make logrotate rotate the log-files once a week and keep a backlog of 52 times one week.

Now, on Ubuntu 10.10 (and I use the same proper graphics driver) it consumes mean of 15% of CPU (least of 11%, max of 34%). What may the reason be?\n\nA: maybe a bug in drivers or kernel?\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.10 is in beta. Have you tried reporting this as a bug? Also, what means are you using to record the cpu usage? Some programs have overhead or report it incorrectly. (Not that I do not believe you).\nAlso reasons may be an obscure bug for your graphics hardware, perhaps due to something in the xorg stack. If it uses OpenGL, perhaps it now is only using software rendering due to an incompatibility. Etc..\n", "Q: How to enable video playing on a second monitor using Intel graphics? On Windows overlay-rendered video playback was working correct on all the monitors. On Linux I not only have to place my external monitor below (instead of right to) my laptop's panel to enable its full resolution , but video player displays blue square instead of the video picture if placed on the second display. Can I overcome it other way than by using software video rendering?\nI use Intel 82852/855GM graphics and Ubuntu 10.10. I mainly use raw mplayer to play video.\nUPDATE: I've noticed, that the problem only takes place when I use a big (1600x1200) monitor (placed under the laptop's panel, otherwise it's impossible to use that big resolution with Intel driver (or just my oldie Intel card)). When I use a 1024x768 external panel (placed to the right of the laptop's panel), overlay video rendering seems to work ok on both screens.\n\nA: Install the xorg-edgers drivers: https://edge.launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers\nI had problems with the default drivers in Ubuntu 10.10 on an 945GM Intel card when the total screen area was bigger than 2048x2048. I have installed the xorg-edgers drivers and it seems to be working fine now (albeit no 3D).\nTo try things without messing your setup, install Ubuntu on a USB stick, boot it, install the xorg-edgers drivers, reboot on the USB stick and see if things work better.\n\nA: As updating video drivers does not help, I've found a workaround. It's to launch a player for the same file (I use raw mplayer) twice (and then close the first instance) - first playback window shows a blue square and a second shows a picture as it is meant to. Note that the problem only occurs on big monitors - if a second monitors is 1024x768 there is no problem, if a monitors is 1600x1200 the problem occurs even if it is the only monitors turned on.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.04 Gnome/X hang I have Ubuntu 10.04 running on a Dell laptop/Nvidia video. Everything works fantastic, except for one \"nit\" that is VERY annoying.. Every so often the graphical interface stops responding, such that the following happens: any gnome-terminals I happen to have open are still working normally, if I have Audacious running, the music continues to play, but all Gnome panels no longer respond, I cannot drag any open windows around, but I can right-click on the desktop and get that Gnome menu, but none of the menu selections respond. The first time this happened, I had to powercycle the laptop, as I didnt have any shell-window open.. It was then I discovered that Ubuntu now disables the ctl-alt-bksp/X restart. I've since re-enabled it, and an X restart restores the gui. This happens often at least once a day, and since I use the laptop daily, it becomes annoying to lose the apps I had running when I have to restart X. I've tried checking dmseg/syslog/messages immediately after this happens, but have not spotted any \"smoking-gun\" pointing to why this is happening. I first thought it might be Compiz causing it, so I disabled it, still happened. Since the laptop has Nvidia 8400M video, I use the Nvidia closed-source \"blob\" driver.. I'm posting here to see if 1) anybody else is seeing this, 2) where I should be looking for the cause....\nThanks\n\nA: When the freeze happens, can you get a terminal by hitting Alt+F2 and typing gnome-terminal? If so, try a tail ~/.xsession-errors before hitting Ctrl-Alt-Backspace or otherwise restarting the X session, as that file will show errors from the current session only IIRC. You might also try ~/xsession-errors.old for information about the previous session. See man xsession for more information.\nAlso, you can try running xlsclients while the machine is running ok and save that output to a file. Then when the session crashes, run xlsclients again and see if there is a difference in the two sets of output. \nIf an entry is missing from the second set of output for a client that still shows on your screen (or that you know you didn't otherwise actively shut down) then that suggests that the client has crashed and possible hung others which depend on it for input.\n", "Q: How can I divide processes amongst multiple computers I have a spare computer that has Ubuntu server edition (10.04.1) installed on it and was wonder if there was a way to use my server to help processes data on my Ubuntu desktop (same release).

Individual programs must be specifically designed to perform distributed computing.\nThe conceptual explanation is that, in order for another computer to assist with a processing task, the prerequisite input instructions and resources must be completely predicted and passed to the computer ahead of time. Even if the difficult problem of predicting processing tasks can be solved, the overhead involved in sending the instructions and resources to another system is too costly for the kind of processing typically done on a desktop computer.\nFor distributed computing to result in a net increase in efficiency, the amount of processing input that can be predicted must be large compared to the overhead in communication. In practice, this limits the possible applications to computationally-intensive mathematical problems like protein folding and 3D rendering.\n\nA: Just in-case anyone else comes looking here I thought I'd share what I've found.\nThere's a project known as LinuxPMI that is designed to share processes between a network of computers configured to use it.\nFor research purposes as projects may merge and become discontinued this history may help in locating it in the future:\nA project called clusterix was created that used openMosix project as it's basis for clustered / grid computing.\n\nA: As stated by someone else, this currently isn't available for general computing. It is available in specialized applications in Linux such as DVDRip.

Is there any simple (IE: right click in Nautilus) way to password protect a particular folder/file in Ubuntu? I've got a few files containing sensitive info and I'd much prefer that if/when I leave my computer alone, they aren't accidentally accessed by someone else.\nThe secruty does not have to be extremely tight. My only concern is that when family/friends come over, I don't really like the idea of them looking at my bank details, accounts or, you guessed it, porn collection.\nA simple, effective way to let me put my machine in the hands of someone else knowing that said machine can not cause me embarresment is the sole reason why I'd like to see this in Ubuntu.\n\nA: greyfade's answer is correct. Ubuntu is a multi-user system. If anyone else uses your computer they should have their own user account. One user per account; there is no good reason for users to share accounts, ever. You can set up a hotkey to log out when you leave your computer. Using Ctrl+Alt+L when you leave locks the computer. If someone else wants to use it, they can log in to their own account without affecting your session.\nAgain, sharing user accounts is a bad habit and a bad idea for many reasons. Please don't do it.\n\nA: If you're only concerned about other users on your system who don't have administrator rights, it's enough to use file permissions to control access. If there are other people with administrator rights or physical access, password protection means encryption¹.\nThe easiest way to encrypt a few files under Linux is the encfs filesystem. On the command line, run\nencfs ~/.encfs ~/encrypted\n\nThen create files under the encrypted directory. They are in fact stored in encrypted form inside ~/.encfs. When you've finished working, run\nfusermount -u ~/encrypted\n\nIf you want to encrypt your whole home directory, ecryptfs is a better option. For more information, see What is the easiest way to encrypt a dir? (on Ubuntu) on Super User.\n¹ Strictly speaking, you also need protection against someone installing a keylogger (“evil maid attack”), but that's a lot harder to achive on current desktop operating systems and hardware.\n\nA: No, not really.\nYou can use Truecrypt to create a volume to store sensitive files in (sudo apt-get install easycrypt for a nice front-end), but otherwise there isn't really a way to password-lock your files.\nI'd suggest that you lock or log out when you leave your computer.\n\nA: Password-protecting a file is nice and fine in a system which is otherwise not physically accessible, ie one that you cannot turn off and restart using a live CD for example. If the computer is a desktop that anyone can turn off, one can restart it with a live CD and gain access to all files on the hard disk, whether those are system files, config files, home directories, etc.\nI would rather recommend that you use an encrypted file system, such as TrueCrypt, which will remain useless on any system unless the authorized user enter the proper credentials. It will do more than just password-protect your files, but will also protect them from external accesses. \nEverything also depends on what would be the cost of some of those files were getting shared, vs the cost and effort to implement something as TrueCrypt and the tool presented earlier, easycrypt.\n\nA: Use a Guest session!\nUnless you expect people to gain increased privileges (e.g. root) in your machine, or for example boot from a CD-ROM and mount and browse your filesystems (or even reading the raw disk sectors), you may not have to encrypt some/all files on your hard drive. You can simply set permissions on directories and/or files to keep the \"curious\" from opening and browsing them. This is why, in normal operations, you \n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use a root account as your normal user.\n\n*Don't give out your password (or root's password) to other users. ;-)\n\n\nThe Session applet on the top right of your window allows you to start a Guest session, which disappears when you log out. See for example this image. The Guest Session option starts a temporary session for anyone borrowing your computer. Your files are not visible -- unless you've specifically given universal read permissions. This is the ideal when you just want to \"borrow\" your computer to a guest who wants to do some quick browsing. It might not be what you want if you'd like to provide permanent accounts (i.e. residing under /home, as your account is likely to be). The Guest account cannot \"see\" anything under /home because the session doesn't have the right permissions.\nChange the permissions\n(Note: If someone has root permissions, this won't make a difference. Such a person will be able to access your unencrypted files just the same.) \nSuppose you have a folder (or a set of files) that you want to keep other users from reading/accessing. \n\n\n*\n\n*Select the folder (or files) you want to affect, then right-click on the selection (with your mouse).\n\n*Select Properties.\n\n*Go to the Permissions tab.\n\n*Under the \"Others\" group, select \"Access to folder\" and \"Access to file\" as \"None\".\n\n\nThis doesn't encrypt the affected files and directories, but it does keep people (not having root permissions, of course) from prying into your account.\nAllow some users\n(Note: If someone has root permissions, this won't make a difference. Such a person will be able to access your unencrypted files just the same.) \nIf you want to allow only a group of users to access a set of files or folders, you can do the same. For example, you may want to reserve read+write permissions for yourself, but only read permissions for a group (or even read+write for them as well) on those files and folders.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the group name you want to select doesn't yet exist, you'll have to create it. Go to System > Administration > Users and Groups.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Manage groups button. \n\n*Click Add. You'll need to enter your password (if your account has admin permissions, otherwise use the root password if you have it).\n\n*Enter a group name. The group names follow the same rules when providing a user name; I suggest you only use letters and numbers, without spaces. You can leave the suggested Group ID (starting at 1001 for example). Select the users that will belong to the group.\n\n*Click OK to apply. Click Close on the previous window. Click Close to close Users and Groups. \n\n*You may need to logout+login for your account to \"see\" the new group. It also applies to any already-logged in users.\n\n\n*Use the same procedure as above to apply Group permissions. Please note that you'll have to provide the Group name when applying permissions. You can only use one group.\n\n\nThis doesn't encrypt the affected files and directories, but it does keep people (not having root permissions, of course) from prying into your account.\nEncryption\nOther users here have provided more details specifically for solutions using encryption. If you really require encryption -- and not just controlling access to your files -- you may want to look into those answers. But please note that access to those files will always be slower, due to the necessary overhead for applying the encryption/decryption algorithms. The description I provided above implements a (very!) basic measure of access control with virtually no performance impact.\n\nA: Try to search for and install ‘ecryptfs-utils’ in Ubuntu Software Center \n\nAfter installing, go to Applications –> Accessories –> Terminal and run the command below:\necryptfs-setup-private\n\n\nYou’ll be prompted to type your login passphrase (password), and to create one for your private folder.\n\nWhen you’re done creating your password, Log Out and Log back in.\n\nNext, go to Places –> Home Folder.\n\nAnd new folder should be created in your home directory called ‘Private’. This folder in encrypted and password-protected. Move all your personal stuff into this folder to secure them.\n\nUsers without access to the folder will be denied.\n\nFor More Help\n\nA: You can use the Archive Manager to zip the file and password protect the zip file.\nThat is probably the closest thing to right clicking and entering a password that you describe.\nTo do this right click on the file and choose \"Compress\" then choose zip as the archive type and in \"Other options\" you have the option to enter a password.\nThis is simple to do and stops the problem of someone mounting the file system from a live CD and getting the file that way.\nAlso you can easily email the file or copy to USB stick, etc without having to worry about having the means to unencrypt the files at the other end, you just need the password.\n\nA: As many pointed out, access control based on user id and encrypted filesystem is the only real way of securing user data. If, however, all that is stopping you from using Truecrypt is because you don't have a free partition / filesystem that you can use exclusively for storing encrypted data, then you can still make an encrypted file-system inside a file within your existing filesystem. \nFor this you need to have \"sudo\" rights, i.e., you must be able to run sudo.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the latest version of truecrypt\n\n*Open TrueCrypt (normally found in Applications -> Accessories)\n\n*Using the gui you can create a new volume contained in a file. You can choose the location of this file.\n\n*Steps 1-3 are one-time setup. After this whenever you mount this file-system using truecrypt GUI, you will see it in nautilus. \n\n*You can move the sensitive files and directories within this filesystem.\n\n*When \"you are leaving your computer alone\", unmout this using the \"dismount\" option in the truecrypt GUI.\n\n*It is also important to use a good password (more than 20 characters at least, as recommended by the developers).\n\n\nA: If you want to encrypt a lot of files that you access regularly, an encrypted filesystem is the way to go. But if you have single files that you want to encrypt/decrypt quite rarely (say, a list of passwords) you can do it very easily with a right-click in nautilus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the seahorse-plugins package\n\n*Create a new key for GPG/PGP (Applications - Accessories - Passwords and Encryption Keys)\n\n*After a restart of nautilus (enter nautilus -q in a terminal or simply log out of your GNOME session) you have two new entries in your right-click menu: Encrypt and Sign, respectively Decrypt for encrypted files\n\n\nA: Thank you all for your answers; it seems there is no way to easily stop accidental viewing of certain files and folders. This is very unfortunate; the closest is the .zip file method, but as I'd rather not compress and decompress, I suppose I'll have to make do with the risk. \n\nA: How about hiding the folders in a location they wont see and set the nautilus option on not to show the hidden folders by default ? The easiest way to make a folder hidden is by making its name start with . \nI know this is not the solution for the question you have asked but just a solution i thought might work for your problem. \n\nA: Here is a very simple way: you can use an application named cryptkeeper, a GNOME applet for managing encrypted folders and available by default in the Ubuntu 11.04 repository and previous. It's such a simple way to secure your folder using a password and encrypt it. \nFurther information can be found here on my website.\n\nA: for simple text file encryption and decryption with sensitive plain text information you can do the following by using terminal. \nopenssl aes-256-cbc -a -salt -in 01.txt -out 02.txt\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -salt -in 02.txt -out 01.txt\n\nthe first command is to encrypt with 256 bit aes and the second one to decrypt. \n01.txt is your plaintext input file and 02.txt obviusly the encrypted output file.\nthe -a is optional and not neccessary, unless you want to be able to copy the text from your encrypted text file.\nterminal will ask you for your password that you then have to type in twice to make sure there is no typo issue for encryption.\nfeatures are, that it works across all platforms, because openssl is supported and mostly pre-configured in all systems by default. you have a good selection of possible encryption-algorhythms to chose from, like: aes, des, blowfish, bf  etc...\nfurthermore you can make your encrypted file a (.) dot-file, in other words a hidden one, by using the \"mv\" command.\nmv 01.txt .01.txt\n\nA: sudo apt-get install cryptkeeper\n\n                                After installing, go to Applications –> System Tools –> Cryptkeeper.\n                                        Cryptkeeper will automatically attach itself to the top panel\n                   \n                     To create an encrypted protected folder, click on Cryptkeeper applet and select                                                                             ‘New encrypted folder’\n                   \n                          Then type the folder name and where to save the folder and click ‘Forward’.\n                   \n                                                              Type the password and click ‘Forward’.\n                   \n                                                      The folder will be created and ready to be used.\n                   \n                   To access all encrypted folder, click on Cryptkeeper applet on the panel and select                                                                                                each folder.\n                   \n                                                   Type the password before it is mounted to be accessed.\n                   \n                                                       Done\n                   \n                 To delete a folder or change the password, right-click the folder in the panel-applet.\n                                                                                      For More Help\n\nA: GPG has a symmetrical encryption option (ie password protect) gpg -c.

Mainly looking for a logical plan to go about this. I can provide additional info if this is not enough to go on.\n\nA: I do not know anything specific that could be done, though Ubuntu does have a built in wireless backports package. That might enable your hardware to work itself. Unless you know you need an external download to allow it to work. To install just search 'wireless backport generic' in synaptic. There should be a meta package for wireless.\nIf you know what configuration files you need, back them up to a flash drive and then restore them manually.

The question says it all. Did Cannonical make any changes to the basic GNU/Linux OS before building Ubuntu on top of it, or is the full GNU/Linux still under there somewhere?\n\nA: There isn't really a \"basic\" GNU/Linux OS. Linux is an operating system kernel. A kernel is a set of protocols that allows the software on your computer to interact with the hardware on your computer.\nA Linux \"distribution,\" like Ubuntu, is a kernel plus a lot of useful software, including an installer, command line interface, editors, GUI, etc. A lot of this software has roots in the GNU project, which is why many people refer to a distribution as \"GNU/Linux\". \nMost of the basic tools are the same across distributions. Canonical's contribution has mainly been to streamline the user experience in the installer and graphical user interface. Once you get under the hood, the tools are basically the same as in any other distribution.\n\nA: Among these question and answers there are a lot of erroneous ideias.\nAn Operating System is a program or a set of programs that manage hardware resources and applications. Period.\nThis is what Linux does.\nThere are a lot of people that have written software that runs on Linux (That can interact with the hardware through Linux). And much of this software is open source.\nAcctually, Linux by itself would not have served any purpose at the beginning without some basic applications to interact with it. A shell and a set of basic commands, like cp, mv, ls, etc, etc. When Linux was released, The GNU Software foundation had already released some POSIX-compillant set of applications that could be ran on any POSIX-compilant system (i.e. Linux). Thus, Linux has mostly (if not always) been distributed with this set of tools, and that is why some insist in calling it GNU Linux.\nThe GNU/Linux distributions are just collections of software that runs on Linux (including the former GNU applications) that ship together with GNU/Linux. Ubuntu is one of them. \nAs the quality of the distributions is important to their companies, sometimes they improve part of the software they distribute, and sometimes they create new software that is specifically tailored for their distributions.\nCanonical (the company responsible for Ubuntu), has made a lot of improvements in applications that run on GNU/linux and has also created new applications that run on this system.\nThe best example of an application that is being written by Canonical is Unity, the new main ubuntu's graphical interface.\n\nA: Strictly speaking, Linux is the kernel that is used by various distributions. GNU is an organisation that developed and popularised a widely used free software license and also provide a home for various pieces of free software.\nSo there is no standard GNU/Linux operating system (despite what it says on gnu.org). There is GNU kernel (Hurd) but that is nowhere near being a production level kernel, though it is packaged by Debian among others.\nThere are multiple distributions that package up the Linux kernel and lots of GNU software (and X software, GNOME or KDE software, etc) and produce an easy to install and maintain operating system. Ubuntu is one of those distributions.\n\nA: Ubuntu IS Linux, Fedora IS Linux, Slackware IS Linux etc.......\nUbuntu is just a distribution. Distributions basically just makes choices as to what to include and not include. Every distro tweaks things a bit but they're all Linux.\n\nA: I really consider them a whole operating system of their own. Though I like when they acknowledge their free software roots. The one answer above states it well. Yes, Ubuntu does use the Linux Kernel and the GNU Userspace. It also adds it's own technology, as well as the Debian infrastructure and package manager.\n", "Q: Switching a server to static IP from DHCP I am running an Ubuntu 10.04 server installation and I recently had to switch it from DHCP to static ip. I edited /etc/network/interfaces file and switched\niface eth0 inet dhcp\nto  \niface eth0 inet static  \naddress 192.168.1.167  \nnetmask 255.255.255.240  \nnetwork 192.168.1.160  \nbroadcast 192.168.1.175  \ngateway 192.168.1.161\n\nYou'll notice the IPs are a little strange. This is because the sever is now on a special subnet dedicated to isolating specific servers. I also edited the resolv.conf file to include the proper DNS servers (including one of Google's just in case all hell broke lose).\nThe problem is that, seemingly randomly, the machine will lose the ability to talk to the outside world. I know the machine is still up, but it acts like it has no networking at all. I think part of the issue is that there is no DHCP running to this subnet (nor will there be) and the dhclient seems to still be running on occasion which causes some sort of conflict (no idea what) which causes networking to die. I cannot, however, remove the dhcp3-client package as it also causes the ubuntu-minimal package to be removed and that would be bad.\nSo, any ideas? What might be calling the dhclient and what can I do to stop it from running?\n\nA: As mentioned by jneves, it is probably the DHCP client messing things up for you.\nAs an alternative to sudo ifdown eth0-edit-sudo ifup eth0, you can just run /etc/init.d/networking restart after you edited the file. It also has the advantage, that you can do it remotely...\n(Not having enough points on askubuntu, I am not allowed to just comment on jneves' answer, so please do consider this a comment...)\nEdit: Completely forgot; as the above command doesn't disconnect you at any time, your SSH-session should actually survive the re-loading of the configuration. It is quite nice to be able to change the network settings while being connected to said machine...\n\nA: If you haven't rebooted the machine since, that behavior is normal. Changing from dhcp to static ip should be:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo ifdown eth0\n\n*change the configuration\n\n*sudo ifup eth0\nThe reason is that if you do the ifdown after changing the configuration, it behaves as if it's taking down a static interface and doesn't kill the dhclient process that will keep just screwing up your configuration. In that case, just kill the dhclient process with\nsudo killall dhclient\n\nand it should all work out.\n", "Q: Performance issues running Ubuntu 10.04 as guest OS in VmWare with Windows 7 host? I have (portable) Virtualbox installed on a USB key running on a 64-bit Windows 7 host. I installed 32 bit Ubuntu 10.04 as a guest OS. \nDuring spikes in processor usage on the guest OS (based on looking at top), the Ubuntu virtual box freezes up for 5-10 seconds. The guest becomes unresponsive with the VirtualBox window showing as \"not responding\". There seems to maybe be a correlation between this behavior and network accesses. \nI've experimented with the number of CPUs allocated to the virtual box, added and removed RAM, and adding video memory -- all to no avail. I have not attempted disabling or changing the processor level virtualization (VT-x).\nI'm wondering if there's anything particular about Ubuntu 10.4 that might be impacting this? Should I have installed 64-bit Ubuntu (or should it matter!?). Is there a VirtualBox setting I'm missing that would improve my experience?\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: I suppose that running VirtualBox on a USB key is the problem. USB keys have slower write times than harddrives. So what happens is that the Ubuntu VM writes data to it's disk (which is also stored on the USB key I suppose) and the data can't be written fast enough on the key so the VM hangs.\nIf you copy the Ubuntu hard disk image to your harddrive and use this one to boot Ubuntu are you experiencing the same problems?\n\nA: I'd agree that you shouldn't expect good performance from a virtualised product running on a USB device (which is presumably FAT). USB is a very slow bus to try running a hefty job like a virtualised OS through.\n", "Q: Easiest way to copy ssh keys to another machine? I am lazy at home and use password authentication for my home machines. I am ready to move to key based authentication. There are many options on the web on how to do this, including catting then sshing the key over, scping the key over directly, etc.\nI am looking for the easiest and recommended way to copy a key over, hopefully there is a convenience wrapper somewhere in the Ubuntu ssh package?\nI'm already aware on how to shut off password logins.\n\nA: The ssh-copy-id command (in the openssh-client package and installed by default) does exactly this:\nssh-copy-id user@hostname.example.com\n\ncopies the public key of your default identity (use -i identity_file for other identities) to the remote host. \nThe default identity is your \"standard\" ssh key. It consists of two files (public and private key) in your ~/.ssh directory, normally named identity, id_rsa, id_dsa, id_ecdsa or id_ed25519 (and the same with .pub), depending on the type of key. If you did not create more than one ssh key, you do not have to worry about specifying the identity, ssh-copy-id will just pick it automatically.\nIn case you do not have an identity, you can generate one with the tool ssh-keygen.\nIn addition, if the server uses a port different from the default one (22) you should use quotation marks in this way (source):\nssh-copy-id \"user@hostname.example.com -p <port-number>\"\n\n\nA: ssh-copy-id does exactly that.

The older package depends on the newer one to make upgrades smoother for people so that if you had installed flashplugin-nonfree in the past you would have the proper flashplugin-installer when you upgraded.\nIn 10.10 there's only flashplugin-installer. Ideally the Software Center should only be presenting one option to the user, so that's probably a bug. Choosing either one will do the right thing. The prompt in Firefox installs flashplugin-installer, so if you just choose that you'll be fine.\nThe Adobe website gives me the option of a .deb and \"APT for Ubuntu 9.04+\". The apt option just activates the partner channel in the Software Center and installs the right one anyway. (It's the same package!) I am not sure if the .deb automatically installs their repository to get updates, so it's probably the least desirable of the three.\n", "Q: Fetch mail from MSN/Windows Live! in Evolution I'm trying to sync a Hotmail/Windows Live/MSN email account to Evolution - however I'm unable to do so with both POP and IMAP. If I understand correctly this is because Microsoft blocks all email clients other than Outlook. Is there a way around this?\n\nA: After a lot of hunting through old threads on the forums. I was mistaken that POP is disabled for all non-Microsoft clients. Here are the settings that worked for me.\nIn Evolution go to Edit -> Preferences. Choose your MSN/Live email account and select \"Edit\".\nReceiving Settings\n\n*\n\n*Server Type: POP\n\n*Server: pop3.live.com:995\n\n*Username: Windows Live Email Address\n\n*Use SSL Connection: SSL encryption\n\n*Authentication Type: Password\n\nSending Settings\n\n*\n\n*Server Type: SMTP\n\n*Server: smtp.live.com:587\n\n*Use Secure Connection: TLS Encryption\n\n*Server Requires Authentication\n\n*Authentication: Plain\n\n*Username: Windows Live Email Address\nAs a side note. When you try to send mail for the first time it will fail. You will get an email from Windows with a link to confirm you are a person and enable this functionality. After that you can Send as expected.\n\nA: Hotmail does indeed support POP3:\n\nhttp://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-Live-Hotmail-POP3-Support-Now-Worldwide-106772.shtml\n\nThe details for connecting are also included in the article.\n", "Q: How to clone audio output? I have two sets of speakers: one is set of stereo loudspeakers with a subwoofer (not 2.1, just a sub with a low-pass filter) and the other is a set of stereo speakers with a headphone jack, used solely as an inline amplifier and volume control for my headphones. \nCurrently I have my PulseAudio output set to \"Analog Surround 4.0 Output.\" My motherboard has output jacks for front, side, rear, and \"Ctr Bass\" which I assume is meant to be a subwoofer channel, for 6.1 surround capability. I have one set of speakers plugged into \"front\" and one set plugged into \"rear\". This gives me approximately what I want: I can listen to the headphones or the loudspeakers just by turning on the appropriate amplifier. \nHowever, I'm not sure that this is quite what I want. I'm assuming that the output of front left and right channels is the same as the rear channels, but I don't know that for sure and I'm seeking reassurance. Just in case I play a game or use some other surround-sound source, I'd like to ensure that these outputs act as two stereo outputs rather than one surround output.\nAlso, I'd like to be able to send audio from a particular client to an output of my choosing. paprefs does not seem to offer this level of fine-grained control. Does anyone know how I can achieve these things?\n\nA: Your fears are founded : rear and front output are the same only when the source is simple stereo (i.e. music, or basic divx films). For other sources (DVDs, but most importantly games), they are different, and you will have a bad experience...\nI Have the same kind of setup as you, but with two sets of speakers and a headset. The only solution I've used so far is use only the front output, with an audio \"strip\". That is crude, but works...\nI'm looking for alternatives, but haven't found yet...\n\nA: I think that in general they are the same, unless and application chooses to use the differently.\nExample: application playing stereo audio: both front and back are the same\nExample 2: application playing movie with surround sound: front and back are different\nAgain, this is just my experience with the computers I've owned. It may differ with you computer.\n\nA: What you want can be done if you don't mind getting your hands a bit dirty:\nYou need to write a small config file (.asoundrc) for your ALSA-sounddriver.\nI can't give you the magic formula because it is very dependent on hardware configuration.\nThere is, however, extensive documentation about how to do it\nSee the links for documentation:\nhttp://alsa.opensrc.org/.asoundrc\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Asoundrc\n\nA: Copy /etc/pulse/default.pa to ~/.pulse/default.pa (only for you as user) or modify it directly (for all users), and add the following two lines to the end:\nload-module module-remap-sink sink_name=multi-ch-stereo master=0 channels=2 master_channel_map=front-left,front-right channel_map=front-left,front-right remix=yes\nset-default-sink multi-ch-stereo\n\nThis should limit your channels to 2 and make sure that these 2 channels are remixed to a multi channel stereo, instead of being used for surround channels when a surround signal is processed.\nremix=yes is the default option anyway. The real action is limiting the channels to two, which are then used by default on front and rear by pulseaudio.\n\nA: The answer you're looking for resides in JACK. When using a LADSPA-compliant application such as Claudia, What you are looking to accomplish (routing specific audio to specific clients, or cloning outputs) is no harder than drawing a line from a source to an output. \n", "Q: upstart config to start sync daemon as non-root user I am planning to use inosync to sync data from master server to several client servers.\nI have created a user called rsyncuser in both master and slaves with access permissions and passwordless ssh access from master to slave servers.\nInosync is working when I use it from the command line as rsyncuser.\nNext I want this to start automatically when server is turned on.

There is no reason to use 'expect fork' with inosync, as it doesn't fork unless you use -d, which is ideally how all upstart managed services would work.\nAlso piping to logger will allow you to leverage your syslog setup rather than creating another log file somewhere. daemon.notice should end up in /var/log/daemon.log.\n", "Q: Dell Studio XPS 16 overheats Since I have switched from Win 7 to Ubuntu, it seems my laptop is much hotter and the fan is much louder.

If you could provide more information about your computer (manufacturer, model, BIOS version) it would be very helpful to find a solution for your problem.\n\nA: Check your CPU is clocked down when not in use. eg. right click a GNOME panel, ‘add to panel’, ‘CPU frequency scaling monitor’. It should go down when you're not doing much. If it's always on top speed you've got a cpufreq problem (sometimes a BIOS upgrade helps fix this).\n\nA: I would first run top and see if you have a load > 1, and if so are any processes eating appreciable percentages of the cpu.  If so, kill the process and verify it brings the temp down, then investigate why that app is behaving badly.\nNext, use powertop to identify if any processes are sucking an unusual amount of power.  Kill and investigate.\nsudo service --status-all  will tell you what services are running.  You can test shutdown of services via sudo service <service> stop.\nUse lsmod to see what kernel modules are loaded.  rmmod can be used to check if the issue is a hardware driver out of control.  (insmod to put the module back, or just reboot).\nYou didn't mention your video hardware, but if you've got ATI or NVIDIA, you could try using the proprietary video driver if your card is supported by it.  Or if you're already using the proprietary driver, try the free one.  Or try upgrading to a newer version (the x-updates PPA contains upgraded drivers).\nI've had three laptops had fans break due to (afaik) age and hardware breakage.  It could be worth ruling out it being just a hardware issues by booting on other livecds or onto windows.  Fan control on Dell XPS seems to be a recurring and known issue...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_XPS ... so you might check Dell support for BIOS upgrades or other solutions.\nFinally, it could be just buggy software control of your fans.  There is fan control software out there which lets you manually enable/disable/tune the fan.  It can be dangerous to manually override BIOS control but if you end up wanting to take this route, google for 'linux fan control software' and be careful.\n\nA: You might want to join all that undervolting business.

Behavior: \nme@local: tree\n.\n|-- ba\n|   `-- file.txt\n|-- foo\n|   `-- file.txt -> ba/file.txt\n`-- foobar\n\nnow, let's say i move the file.txt from ba to foobar:\nme@local: mv ba/file.txt foobar/file.txt\n\nI noticed that the symlink in foo folder still point the ba/file.txt path.\nThere is a way to create symlinks that auto-update the paths when the source file is moved?\nOr symlinks that being deleted when i delete the source file?\nWill be great.\n\nA: You could create hard links.\nHard links have their own downsides, e.g., no links to directories, no links across file systems. And they're not deleted when you delete the \"original\"; in fact, they prevent the drive space for being freed, and you can still access the content through the hard link.\nYou can't create hard links in the file browser (Files, formerly Nautilus), but there's an old bug report (closed, won't fix) about it.\n\nA: There's no way to do this with the normal linux filesystems as far as I'm aware.\nSymlinks are really just a dumb bit of text that says \"look, I'm really called Foo\" - there's no checking that Foo exists, as you've found out. You can make symlinks that point to nothing with the same ease you can make symlinks that point to something useful.\nMaybe someone with more knowledge of filesystems other than ext2/3/4 (like, say, jfs? or zfs? or zfs?) might be able to say if this is possible under more advanced filesystems than ext2/3/4. Maybe NTFS might support this even? NTFS doesn't have symlinks as such, but there is a similar feature called Junction Points.\n\nA: Yes, you can.\nIn the shell, you must type:\nln ba/file.txt foo/file.txt\n\nthis is a strong link, and if you even delete the file in ba/file.txt, it remains in foo/file.txt (you can see how many links there are with ls -l command\nIf you want to do what you did (create a symbolic link), you must type:\nln -s ba/file.txt foo/file.txt\n\n\nA: write a script or program to add an xattr to a file, to tell it the path to a symlink that points to it. then write a wrapper script for utilities you use (eg, mv) to update the symlink's target when the source file is moved.\nAlthough I'm only half joking and this is a feasible solution, there are so many wall cases (as opposed to a corner or edge case...) that is sure to cause a lot of headaches (eg, moving the file with any other program).\n", "Q: What is the difference between upstream and downstream when referring to who to go to as a developer? What is the difference between upstream and downstream when referring to who (or where) to go to as a developer or packager?\n\nA: Think of it as a great river, with the people who write the software as the source of the river. They would be the upstream, futher downstream would be your distribution, and at the end of the river would be the user. Ubuntu is in the middle of the river.\nUpstream would be the software that Ubuntu packages and ships to users. Things like GNOME, Firefox, X.org, the Linux kernel, and many more applications. This is the bulk of the things that are in the archive, as they represent a collection of upstream projects. \nUbuntu has one special upstream, Debian, which Ubuntu derives from. So, they are Ubuntu's upstream for many packages, though for some packages, like the kernel, Ubuntu packages directly from the upstream project, though for the majority of packages Debian is the upstream to Ubuntu, and the project that is packaged is upstream to Debian.\nDownstreams of Ubuntu would be Ubuntu derived distributions, like Linux Mint.\nExamples of usage of this term depends on the context. So for example if you have a bug with Firefox that Ubuntu didn't introduce then you might hear the term \"Make sure you're reporting that bug upstream\". The person means reporting the bug directly to Firefox in this case.\nIn the case of Ubuntu, getting the right feedback from users to the upstream developers is an important thing we do. Here are some links of what we do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upstream information for application developers. I maintain this namespace as a landing page for upstream application developers who want to understand how to work with Ubuntu.\n\n*Reporting bugs upstream, see the report.\n\n*Ensuring patches from users get back upstream so they can be integrated. Remember that every patch carried in a distro has an engineering cost AND improving the software for everyone is a goal.\n\n*Our work with Debian.\n\n\nTo better answer your question here are some examples of how someone would tell you to talk to an upstream:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"I want to make a multimedia application for Ubuntu\" - You would use the upstream gstreamer framework.\n\n*\"I want my app to talk to other apps over the internet\" - You would use the upstream telepathy framework.\n\n*\"I want to add a feature to Firefox.\" - You would go talk to Firefox directly and do all that work upstream.\n\n*\"I want to add an Ubuntu specific feature to Firefox\" - You would talk to Ubuntu as it's likely upstream wouldn't want or care about the feature. A maintainer will let you know.\n\n*Likewise, if you were to report a bug to an upstream app (like Firefox) that was caused by something in Ubuntu, not Firefox, they would refer you to report the bug downstream.

How can I tell a software to use only a specific interface? \nBasically I want Firefox to use eth0 because it is the university lan network and I have to go to intranet sites, the other one is a wifi network open to the internet and I want to bind it to Chrome.\nI'm working and I need to use intranet. So eth0 is my choice but eth0 is an intranet without internet access (obviously).\nSince I want internet access I'm connected to wlan0 (university wifi for students).\nThe problem is if I have both connected sometimes the browser looks for www.stackoverflow.com using eth0. So I wanted to assign a browser to use only a specific interface.  \n\nA: \"ip netns\" creates network namespaces.\nYou can then create virtual interfaces (ip link add... veth) and associate them to the namespaces.\nThe namespaces can be configured to use different routes for example (thus using different interfaces)\nThen you can run commands in that namespace, that will use the created namespace..\n\"ip netns exec NAME cmd...\"\nSource:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/saucy/en/man8/ip-netns.8.html\n\nA: You cannot bind client software to specific network interfaces, but\nyou can tell the kernel that you only want to use one network\ninterface for some IP addresses and the other one for everything else.\nThis is called \"routing\", and can be configured using the commands\n/sbin/route and /sbin/ip.\nIf I read your question correctly, you want to connect to intranet IP\naddresses using interface eth0 and to the Internet using interface\nwlan0.\nIf you run the command ip route list, you should see an output\nlike the following (numbers will be different, and also you can have\nmore lines in it):\n$ ip route list\n10.60.44.0/25 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.60.44.39  metric 1 \n192.168.80.0/21 dev wlan0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.84.122  metric 2 \n[...]\ndefault via 10.60.44.1 dev eth0  proto static \n\nThe first two lines tell you about the networks connected to\ninterfaces eth0 and wlan0: network traffic directed to computers\non those networks will be directly sent to them through the\ncorresponding interface.\nThe last line tells you what the \"default route\" is: if your computer\nwants to talk to a computer on a network it is not attached to (e.g.,\nthe stackoverflow.com server), it will route traffic via eth0,\nrealying through host 10.60.44.1 (called the \"default gateway\").\nSo, to route Internet traffic thorugh wlan0 you should ensure that\nthe last line in the ip route list output reads something like:\ndefault via A.B.C.D dev wlan0 proto static\n\nwhere A.B.C.D is the IP address of the gateway on the wireless LAN.\nIf the output does not contain \"dev wlan0\", you can change it with the\ncommand:\nsudo ip route change to default dev wlan0 via A.B.C.D\n\nYou can find out the correct A.B.C.D for wlan0 in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look into directory /var/lib/dhcp3/: you should find some\ndhclient-...-wlan0.lease files.  Open the most recent one and\nsearch for a line with the string option router in it: the rest\nof the line tells you the IP address A.B.C.D.\n\n*Ask your local network administrators.  (Probably the best thing to\ndo, anyway.)\nWith this configuration, you should be able to:\n\n\n*\n\n*browse the Internet through wlan0\n\n*browse your Intranet through eth0, provided it is on a single network.\n\n\nIf your intranet spans multiple networks, then you will need to add\nroutes for them - and this is definitely something that requires you\nto interact with the local network admins. :-)\n", "Q: Nautilus icon view as default in a specific folder I would like to set a few of my folders with a specified zoom level and set to icon view (e.g. my ebook folder) Is there anyway to do this?\n\nA: My Nautilus does this by default ...

I would like to be able to choose any already-open window and minimize it from the command line. Is this possible?\n\nA: In Kubuntu 12.04 I use the following command to minimize the active window:\nxdotool windowminimize $(xdotool getactivewindow)\n\nI suspect you may replace the $(xdotool getactivewindow) with a string identifying any window that you need to minimize.\n\nA: You could use xdotool to simulate the keyboard event Alt-F3 after focusing on the window. It's a hack, but depending on your problem, it might be enough.\n\nA: You use xdotool.  Note that the default unity shortcut key for minimizing the active window is Ctrl-Alt-0  BUT that this ONLY means the numeric keypad zero.  If you type the regular zero key, the one between the 9 and the -, then it will not work. (Also not when typing it on the keyboard. \nXdotool knows the numeric keypad zero key as 'KP_Insert'.  \nSo to minimize the active window, you first make sure xdotool installed, then use the command: \nxdotool key Ctrl+Alt+KP_Insert\n(Note that the key Alt-F3 mentioned in another answer will not work\n\nA: You can kind of do this with WMCtrl. It's a tool that allows you to control the window manager from the command line. You can find it in the repositories.\nIt's compatible with Metacity and KWin (The defaults for Gnome and Kde).\nYou can use this command to get a list of currently open windows. This will include the window name:\nwmctrl -l\n\nOnce you have the window name, you can use this command to shade a window:\nwmctrl -r \"windowname\" -b toggle,shaded\n\nI don't think minimization is supported because it's not covered by the EWMH spec, but you can do shading and maximization so it might suit your needs.\nEDIT :\nIn 2022, there are option for this :\nwmctrl -r \"windowname\" -b toggle,hidden\n\nSee @dgo.a answer\nCan I minimize a window from the command line?\n\nA: to minimize the active window\nxdotool getactivewindow windowminimize\n\nworks on gnome3.24 shell extension such as custom hot corner, \"xdotool windowminimize $(xdotool getactivewindow)\" won't.\n\nA: Another xdotool example:\nxdotool search --onlyvisible --classname --sync Navigator windowminimize\n\nThis searches (and waits, due to --sync) for a visible Navigator window, and then minimizes it.\nSee xdotool(1) section COMMAND CHAINING:\n\nxdotool supports running multiple commands on a single invocation. Generally, you'll start with a search command (see \"WINDOW STACK\") and then perform a set of actions on those results.\n\n\nA: You can minimise an application window regardless of its current state using wmctrl as follows:\nwmctrl -r \"application-name\" -b add,hidden\n\nTo maximise:\nwmctrl -r \"application-name\" -b remove,hidden\n\n\"application-name\" can be any substring in the application name, and is case insensitive (use the -F option if this is not what you want). \"hidden\" is wmctrl's word for minimise.\nFor example:\nwmctrl -r firefox -b add,hidden\n\nminimises the first window that contains the string \"firefox\", in any mixture of upper and lowercase letters.\nTo see the list of windows, type:\nwmctrl -l\n\ndgo.a's comment above is great if you just want to toggle between maximised and minimised states.\n", "Q: What do the symbols in service --status-all mean?

This would be ok except that the command produces output like the following:\n [ + ]  winbind\n [ ? ]  wpa-ifupdown\n [ - ]  x11-common\n\nI'm guessing that those symbols mean something like listening, blocked, or stopped, but which is which? More importantly, why doesn't the man page say?\n\nA: To provide a shallow and unsatisfactory answer your first question:\n\n\n*\n\n*The command service --status-all literally runs service <name> status for each service that supports the status command. Convention is for these to return success if the service is running and an error otherwise. A [ + ] is drawn upon success and a  [ - ] upon error.\n\n*The [ ? ] is drawn for services that don't mention a status command in service <name>.\n\n\nAs you might have anticipated, I learned this by reading the source code.\nTo address the real issue—the lack of documentation—I suggest filing a polite bug report about the manpage on Launchpad. ubuntu-bug sysvinit-utils should get you started.\n\nA: services-admin was removed from the default installation some releases ago due to the fact that it was unable to handle Upstart jobs.\nIn 10.10, a utility to manage services has returned: jobs-admin will be able to control and configure both Upstart and System V jobs/services. If you'd like to give this a try now, check out the jobs-admin/jobservice PPA.\nAs for the symbols in your question, I believe + is running/enabled, ? is configured to start but may not be currently running (run-once, maybe), and - is likely disabled or not running.\nDisclaimer: I am the developer of jobs-admin and jobservice and worked on it as a summer of code project for Ubuntu. It is not available on a default installation, but I'd like to work towards that for 11.04.\n", "Q: 404 error when trying to update \nLast 14 days I am having problem in upgrading. Each time when I attempt to upgrade, I get a message (See attached image).\nPlease help me in solving this issue\n\nA: (note: all my references to menu entries and window titles may be broken. I don't have an english version of Ubuntu, so I'm just translating from my own UI. I hope it will help you find the propper items anyway.\nAnyone with an English UI is welcome to edit my post with the propper names :-) ).\nYou seem to have a third party repository installed, that doesn't answer anymore.\nActually, given its name, it looks more like a \"sample PPA address\" than a real thing...\nDo you remember adding an external software some times ago (say: 14 days ago) ?\nHere are some ideas about what to do with it:\n1) You can uncheck it from your sources list, to remove the error and upgrade everything else.\nGo to System->Administration->Software Sources, then open the \"Other software\" tab. You should see a list of external repositories, and the one listed in your error (http://ppa.launchpad.net/user/ppa-name/ubuntu/) should be there.\nJust uncheck the box next to it, or even remove it from the list, then close the window and launch the \"Update Manager\" again.\n2) If the PPA should really be working and you installed things through it, removing it from the sources will break the link of this software to its original repository, which means it won't be updated anymore. Maybe you don't really care, and then it's ok, but if you want to know what software it is and see if you can re-install its repository, follow the guidelines below :\nTo locate it, you can go to Synaptics (System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager). On the lower left corner, you can select the \"state\" button, which shows, on the upper left, the \"local\" installed components. All software that are not linked to a repository will be shown there (either installed by a .deb, or because the link is broken as said above).\nIf you have such \"local\" software, you can then try to understand where it was supposed to come from. Then you can try to re-install the propper repository for it (as you did in the first place).\nThis really depends on the software itself, so I can't be more precise...\nHope this helps...\n", "Q: How to mark an option for install during burg install (non-graphical install) So when I tried installing Burg it came to a screen to select which device to install burg on.

That worked for me.\n", "Q: Drag forward installed Python packages when upgrading As somebody who runs multiple webservers each running a set of Django sites, keeping on top of my Python stack is very important. Out of (probably bad) habit, I rely on Ubuntu for a number of my Python packages, including python-django and a lot of python-django-* extras. The websites require these to run but as long as the package still exists, this isn't an issue. I do this rather than using VirtualEnv (et al) because I want Ubuntu to install security updates.\nHowever the Ubuntu repos don't cater for everybody. There are cases where I'll use pip or easy_install to suck in the latest version of a Python package. When you update Python (as occasionally happens in Ubuntu), you lose all your pip-installed packages.\nWhat terrifies me is the deeper I get, the more servers I administer, there's going to be an OS update one day that requires hours and hours of my time running around, testing sites, reinstalling python packages through pip. The worst bit of this is potential downtime for client sites though I do test on my development machine (always at Ubuntu-latest) so this should offset some of that worry.\nIs there anything I can do to make sure updates to Python mean the existing, non-dpgk'd Python packages are brought forward?\nThat would make sure I always had access to the same packages. I'd still have to test for incompatibilities but it would be a good start.\nThere's perhaps one better solution: an application that behaved like apt and dpkg but for interacting with PyPi (where pip and easy_install get most of their mojo). Something that stored a local list of installed packages, checked for updates like apt, managed installing, etc. Does such a thing exist? Or is it a rubbish idea?\n\nA: Regarding how to keep your Python packages when the system Python is\nupgraded: I see two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install non-Ubuntu Python stuff with easy_install\n--install-dir /usr/local/python Then you make sure that all your\nwebapps include that directory into sys.path, for instance by\nincluding it into PYTHONPATH, or using a directory that is\nautomatically included by site.py (whose doc states that \"Local\naddons go into /usr/local/lib/python<version>/dist-packages\")\n\n*You can use virtualenvs, provided you can place all your app data\nand configuration in a directory independent of the code.\nHere's a sketch procedure:\na. Place all the code-independent stuff into directory\n    myapp-data/\nb. Create virtualenv myapp-code.XXX/ (where XXX is some\n    unique version number, e.g., date -I)\nc. Place app code and all dependency packages in myapp-code.XXX\nd. ln -s myapp-code.XXX myapp-code\nWhen you have to upgrade, you just repeat steps b. and c. with a\ndifferent revision code YYY, then: stop currently running app,\nsymlink myapp-code to myapp-code.YYY, start app from virtualenv\nmyapp-code.YYY.  If something goes wrong, you can still roll back to the\nold virtualenv quickly.\nApparently, 2. is more work (but pip plus some shell-scripting will\ntake you a long way towards automating it), but it should also be more\nrobust and will allow you to concurrently run applications that depend\non different versions of some Python package.\nRegarding your question about an apt-get-like for Python packages:\npip explicitly disallows such a thing, and for a good reason:\npackage APIs and behavior may change across different versions.\nTherefore, if your code runs fine against version X, it may fail when\nrun with version X+1.  This is exactly what pip tries to prevent\nwith its \"freeze\" and \"requirements list\" features.\nOf course, the same argument can be applied to any program in a binary\ndistribution like Ubuntu; indeed, what makes apt-get useful is that\nDebian and Ubuntu provide a coordinated release of interoperable\npackages: a lot of effort from the maintainers goes into ensuring that\nall Ubuntu packages in the main repositories are compatible.  \nThere is just no such coordinated release of Python packages: each\npackage is independent and no information is available about what\nversion of other Python packages are compatible with it.  (This could\npossibly be a good addition to PyPI metadata.)\n\nA: I would use a configuration management system like puppet or chef to run scripts on all servers to keep them all in sync. Your scripts (recipes) can manage the upgrade including automatic testing if the upgrade was successful or broke something.\n", "Q: Way(s) of browsing the filesystem that are more flexible I have two related questions, both probably (but not necessarily preferentially) accepting the same answer :\n\n\n*\n\n*When browsing or exploring the filesystem in a GUI, I want to be able to right click on the empty space between the files, choose a menu item and say 'open terminal in this folder,' optionally as root\n\n*Do the converse when using the terminal, optionally as root\nI use Universe with kubuntu but have Debian Lenny running with gnome installed separately, so anything on kde or gnome would work\n\nA: You can use xdg-open to open files and directories from the command line. I have an alias of xopen to make the typing a little easier. Put this in your ~/.bashrc to do that, and to have a root file browser using sudo:\nalias xopen=\"xdg-open\"\nalias xopen-root=\"sudo xdg-open\"\n\nIt will open the file in the application that would be used if you double-clicked on it. For example, if you named a text file, it would open in gedit. And if you pass it a directory, it will open the file browser. So if I am in my home directory I can do\n$ xopen Documents\n$ xopen .\n\nand the file browser (nautilus for me) will open that directory. Also note that xdg-open will return immediately - the new program is launched as it's own process and you can type in your next command.\nTo open a terminal from the nautilus file browser, you should install the nautilus-open-terminal package. Then you can right click on a folder, or in the blank space below the files, and open a terminal with the path set to that directory. Not sure how to make it a root terminal though - I always just use sudo myself.\n\nA: Terminal to Nautilus\nFor the terminal side of things, I would just add this to my ~/.bashrc:\nalias browse=\"xdg-open .\"\nalias browse-root=\"gksudo xdg-open .\"\n\nNautilus to Terminal\nThe nautilus-open-terminal extension that others have mentioned is great for most use, but it does not provide a way to open a root shell. The easiest way for you to get this functionality is to save a script like the following as ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/Open in Terminal (Root):\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI\ngnome-terminal -x sudo -s\n\nA fun variation on this would be to make a GNOME Terminal profile called \"root\" with a scary red background color, an initial title of \"Root Terminal\", and the custom shell command sudo -s. You'd then use a Nautilus script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI\ngnome-terminal --window-with-profile=root\n\n\nA: There's a nautilus script handily packaged in the Ubuntu repositories to do this for you.  Click here to install or run the following command.  \nsudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal\n\nYou may have to restart gnome/nautilus for it to work.\n\nA: If you already have Ubuntu-tweak installed, you can also just tick the box for nautilus extensions.\nNot sure if it's compatible with Lenny, right enough!  :-)\n\n", "Q: Network not starting up on boot Basically my network won't start. Can't use wired connections.\nTo make it a further brain-scratcher, when booting into recovery, and using the network console, the network comes up and works. Outside of recovery nothing.\nAs far as I can tell no settings changed between powering off and on since last time it worked, except for an automatic kernel upgrade. Using an older kernel does not seem to help.\nAlso this hardware configuration worked perfectly fine for over a year with kernel upgrades and all.

Open /etc/network/interfaces and check if there is a line for eth0 If not add the following:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nThis will add the eth0 interface - and use DHCP on boot and wakeup.\nIf you're still not getting DHCP response you may also need to add dhcp back into defaults:\nsudo update-rc.d dhcp3-server defaults\n\nA: What does ifconfig -a show when it's not working? Is there an eth0? If it's not, I'd check the modules blacklists /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist*. I would have expected the recovery console to honour these though so moving on...\nIf you do have an interface, it could be some dodgy config inside network-manager. Recovery mode just uses some defaults IIRC so I'd open up the network settings (right click the applet, click edit connections) and check a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect Automatically is checked\n\n*You have a MAC address\n\n*MTU is automatic\n\n*802.1x security is disabled\n\n*IPv4 is set to Automatic (DHCP)\n\n*Require IPv4 is checked\n\n*There should be no special routes\n\n*IPv6 is set to ignore\n\n\nIf ifconfig -a isn't showing an eth0 device, it could be something bizarrely hardware specific. What does lspci | grep net show? If nothing, do you know what the network chipset is?\n\nA: Could pm-powersave be the cause of your problem?

Does one have better quality etc?\nMy Dell Mini originally came with Fluendo installed, but I have since upgraded several times and just used Medibuntu - but I am wondering if I am missing something.\n\nA: Fluendo multimedia codecs exists as commercial products because of software patents (required for decoding mpeg, mp3, etc) and silly-DRM removal laws (ie parts of DMCA, Digital Economy and ACTA) that stop you removing the CSS DRM on DVDs. The Medibuntu variants are still free software as they're not infringing any copyright (to my knowledge anyway).\nWhether you legally need it or not comes down to where you live honouring software patents or the DMCA-style DRM-cracking laws.\nRegarding quality: the codebase for each implementation is different so there is scope for one implementation being better than another. The only test I've really seen is ffmpeg vs Google's own implementation, where ffmpeg trounces Google.\nDell plays it safe. They want top sell a product internationally that they can advertise as being able to play DVDs. That means they have to adhere to local laws and that undoubtedly means they'll need to license the software in some regions. I expect it is easier (and therefore cheaper) for them to just bulk-license from Fluendo.\n", "Q: How to automatically update burg after a kernel update After every kernel update I have to run update-burg manually. How do I make it automatic?\n\nA: Another method for you is to edit /etc/kernel-img.conf\ndo_symlinks = yes\nrelative_links = yes\ndo_bootloader = no\ndo_bootfloppy = no\ndo_initrd = yes\nlink_in_boot = no\npostinst_hook = update-burg\npostrm_hook = update-burg\n\nFrom: https://bugs.launchpad.net/burg/+bug/594431 (a bug report echos your experience)\nThis can similarly be wiped out by updates but as it's in /etc/ you should (I think) get a prompt to keep your existing configuration when an update does hit.\nAs people in the bug go on to say, this still isn't ideal as there's every possibility that somebody might want to run both burg and grub or at the very least keep the two synced.\nYou could go one further and write a new script like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\nexec update-grub \"$@\"\nexec update-burg \"$@\"\n\nSave it as /usr/sbin/update-bootloaders, chmod +x it, and then stick update-bootloaders in /etc/kernel-img.conf in place of update-grub or update-burg.\nI guess in the long term, an alternatives system needs to be set up for various bootloaders as exists for java, audio and other interchangeable subsystems.\n\nA: Normally update-grub gets called. This is just something that happens. The system expects grub to be the bootloader. Assuming you're never going to use grub again, you can do this:\ncd /usr/sbin/\nsudo mv update-grub update-grub.backup\nsudo ln -s update-burg update-grub\n\nThis moves update-grub out the way and creates a symlink in its place that actually runs update-burg. So when a new kernel installs, it'll call update-grub which is actually update-burg.\nHacky but it should work.\nTo reverse:\ncd /usr/sbin/\nsudo rm update-grub # this is only a symlink\nsudo mv update-grub.backup update-grub\n\n\nA: If you have the habit of doing sudo apt-get upgrade to update your packages and kernels, the following script will solve your problem and is 100% resilient to updates:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check what kernels are installed.\nKERLST=`ls /boot | grep vmlinu`\n\n# Do updates.\nsudo apt-get -y update\nsudo apt-get -y upgrade\nsudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade\n\n# Update burg if kernels changed. \nif [ \"$KERLST\" != \"`ls /boot | grep vmlinu`\" ]; then\n    sudo update-burg\nfi\n\nSave is as a text file apgrade.sh and mark it as executable. This script will perform every possible update, check whether the kernel list has changed, and update burg in case it did. I've been using it since 10.04 (bound to an alias), and no updates have broken it so far.\nIf, however, you like doing your updates manually through synaptic, then Oli's method might be better. \n\nA: Thanks! \nI created a script based on the most-helpful/best-rated information provided here. One subtle change is that the boot-loader executables are no longer exec'd (as in the case of grub it exits; thus the script exits and other loaders are not executed (@Ubuntu11)).\nThe script can be configured for multiple bootloaders.. (if the executable is update-name and in /usr/sbin;-). \nIt could be extended to allow update executables that are not update-name. To do this maybe use name:exec as values in the boot-loaders config variable and split the var then change the execution command accordingly (would probably need to use a different language for this to be elegant).\n#!/bin/sh\n# #################################################################\n#\n# Updates (multiple) bootloaders after kernel update.\n#\n# @shell bash\n# @see http://askubuntu.com/questions/4905/how-to-automatically-update-burg-after-a-kernel-update\n#\n# #################################################################\n#\n# Install:\n#\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------\n# * Save as:   /usr/sbin/update-bootloaders\n# * Then:      chmod +x /usr/sbin/update-bootloaders\n# * Edit /etc/kernel-img.conf and append/replace the following parameters:\n# ** postinst_hook = update-bootloaders\n# ** postrm_hook = update-bootloaders\n#\n# #################################################################\n#\n# Configuration:\n#\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------\n# BOOTLOADERS: configuration variable to list bootloaders\nBOOTLOADERS=\"grub burg\"\n#\n# #################################################################\nset -e\nfor BOOTLOADER in ${BOOTLOADERS}; do\n    EXEC=\"/usr/sbin/update-${BOOTLOADER}\"\n    if [ -x ${EXEC} ]; then\n        echo \"Updating ${BOOTLOADER}...\"\n        ${EXEC} \"$@\"\n    fi\ndone\n# eof\n\n", "Q: How to create a Remote Aptitude/APT Repository?

Some document management software?\n\n*Some documents are in JPG while others are in PDF.\n\n\nA: Just a quick info, not really a solution:\nNotes aren't written to the file itself, they are stored in a file in ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata.\nSince this is in your ~, it makes sense that it wouldn't be shared with other accounts.\nSo it doesn't matter that the files are shared, the notes to the files are your personal notes, and won't be shared.\n\nA: As the notes aren't stored in the file itself (as per ParanoiaPuppy's answer), the only way you could make the notes \"public\" in the sense that they can be shared is to embed your notes in the jpg itself, using Exif (actually as IPTC keywords).  This will only work for jpg files (to my knowledge), so your PDFs would have to be updated some other way, perhaps annotations on the PDF itself.\nTo update the Exif properties on a jpg, I can recommend using jBrout, which I write about, and Exif generally here : http://www.scaine.net/site/2010/01/jbrout/\nIn fact, this might not help, since you might need to use more than IPTC keywords for the notes you're adding.  jBrout supports a \"Comment\" field which does appear to be written to the file somehow, but sadly it's not visible by Nautilus.\nTo demonstrate, here's a file with two IPTC keywords and a comment added via jBrout, then viewed in Nautilus - there's only the keywords visible... no comment.  It's not in the \"notes\" tab either, I'm afraid.\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: mouse stuck after resumption from suspend I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 on a Gateway TA1 convertable tablet PC.

I use my laptop's built-in trackpad as a pointing device with 'tap to click' enabled. This seems to happen between 10 and 25% of the time. It's quite annoying. Anyone have any idea what causes this?\n\nA: Are you tapping close to an edge or corner by any chance?

In Firefox, by default, middle-clicking on a link opens it in a new tab.\n\nA: When I access my computer over VNC from my phone sometimes I find that the Control key gets sent a lot of the time. I know it's a different use-case to yours but it could be that your control key is getting stuck (or you're accidentally pressing it - I know how easy that can be on some small keyboards).\nYou might be able to test this by running xev and seeing what keys get sent when you click. It throws a lot of output so it might be easiest writing it to a log xev > ~/Desktop/xev.output clicking the mousebox a few dozen times like you would click a link and then searching the output for whatever the control key looks like (it might make sense to press the control keys a few times to see what their output looks like for comparison)\nEither that or the links are have the attribute target=\"_blank\" set..

When I open a folder in the tree pane, I want to display the sub-folders, and am likely to want to see all of them.  I often then want to open a sub-folder and view the folders within that.\nWhat often happens is that part of the list of sub-folders is displayed.  I scroll so I can see them all, select one, and then have to scroll to see all of them...\nIs there a way to configure nautilus so that the folder display is scrolled when I open a sub-folder, to enable me to see all the sub-folders - or at least, the first screen of them?\n\nA: Nautilus does not currently have a way to do this.\nFrom a technical perspective, this actually shouldn't be too hard to implement. Nautilus uses the GtkTreeView widget to display the file tree, so in a way it already has the ability to scroll to a specific item in the list. The only missing piece is the instruction from Nautilus to tell GtkTreeView to scroll.\nThe more difficult task is in convincing the GNOME development team that this scrolling behavior will make Nautilus more intuitive for everyday users. If you want to pursue this, the first step is to suggest the idea on Nautilus's Ubuntu Brainstorm page. This is the developers' preferred means of suggesting ideas that would be quick to program.\n", "Q: Tool to convert PDF file into separate HTML files?

In System->Administration->Printers you can select the printer: \n\nRight click on your printer and select properties, then click on the Button next to Make and Model that is labeled \"Change\", then the system will go looking for a driver:\n\nSince you have it installed this won't take long (it can fetch updated ones from openprinting.org so there's never a need to manually install drivers). After the search it will give you an option to use the driver, select the one with (HPIJS). Now the printer options should be available in the \"Printer Options\" section of the last screenshot.\nAs a bonus, HP provides a native tool for Linux users that provides even more features than the bundled generic tool. It's called the hplip toolbox, you can install it by installing the hplip-gui package or just search for it in the Software Center.\n\nThis is the tool I prefer to use to manager my hp printers.

Areca has updated module source code available on the cd that came with the controller and their website.  Using this I was able to install Ubuntu Server on the hardware by using my laptop to build the kernel module and loading it off a USB stick.  \nI then built the driver for the server kernel and updated initrd but when I reboot it doesn't even look like Grub is getting loaded.  The only thing the system does is display a \"_\" in the upper left of the screen.  I believe I'm seeing a Grub issue but combined with the RAID controller/module issues I'm not 100% positive on that.  Does anyone know of any limitations with Areca controllers and Grub?\nOne weird hurdle that I ran across is that the server install cd uses the desktop kernel rather than the server kernel so you need to build the module twice.\n\nA: Looks like the only requirement is that the volume that Grub is installed on is less than 2TB.  In my case it looks like Grub just didn't install properly and reinstalling grub sorted out my issues.\nHowever I've now documented my procedure for installing Ubuntu Server on an unsupported raid controller.

Also, see the Launchpad bug that addresses the issue.\n\nA: Run these three commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:docky-core/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\ngconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/docky-2/Docky/Items/DockyItem/ShowDockyItem false\n\nThis does the exact the same thing as Zoe's answer (add the PPA, upgrade to the latest version, and hide the anchor item), but all automatically. You will have to restart Docky after you finish.\n\nA: In order to remove the anchor icon from docky, you must first upgrade to the most recent version. To do this, you need to add the development PPA to your list of software sources. On Ubuntu 9.10 and later, you may do this by typing:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:docky-core/ppa\n\nand then refreshing the list of packages with\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThis may not trigger the update, in which case you should open Synaptic package manager, and search for docky. Finding the docky package, select it and use the menu item Package->Force Version. This will let you select the version of docky to install. The fix to remove the anchor icon requires version 1.0 or later.\nOnce you have the Docky-Core PPA version installed (the latest version is 2.2 against the 2.0.6 you find on the default repository), you may disable the docky icon by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open gconf-editor by pressing Alt+F2 and typing gconf-editor.\n\n*Navigate to apps/docky-2/docky/items/DockyItem.\n\n*Deselect the ShowDockyItem key.\n\n*Restart docky.\n\n\nAfter you have disabled your anchor icon, you may still access your docky preferences by right clicking any dividers you may have on the dock.\n\nA: gconftool-2 --type Boolean --set /apps/docky-2/Docky/Items/DockyItem/ShowDockyItem False\nand restart Docky. Set final value to True to turn it back on. Worked fine for me on 12.10. Source\n", "Q: gnome-power-manager is running while trying to log in. How to get rid of it?

I have a logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 connected to my ubuntu desktop and it works fine with Skype.\nHowever, Skype inputs and sends my video at the native (for the webcam I think) resolution of 1600 x 1200. I can confirm that the camera supports a wide variety of resolutions starting from 160 x 120 upto 1600 x 1200 (including e.g., 320 x 240, 352 x 288) using cheese. I can select these resolutions and see the output is appropriately scaled.\nAlso, I don't see any improvements in smoothness of motion in the captured video so I suspect the original 1600 x 1200 is scaled down in the path somewhere.\nIs it possible to somehow to enable this scaling capability towards Skype?\n\nA: There should be a skype configuration file in your home directory:\n~/.Skype/YourUserName/config.xml\n\n(Replace YourUserName with your skype user name). Open this file with a text editor, search for the <Video> tag and try to edit it match your preferred resolution:\n<Video>\n<CaptureHeight>240</CaptureHeight>\n<CaptureWidth>320</CaptureWidth>\n</Video>\n\n", "Q: How to stop using built-in home directory encryption?

Based on this answer, I tried with drivers straight from NVIDIA, and got it working for a while. But now (perhaps due to reboot, or apt-get upgrade) I'm out of luck again. \nThere now seems to be a conflict with the Nouveau driver. I've tried removing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau (as suggested here) and reboot\n\n*I've also tried modprobe -r nouveau but it gives FATAL: Module nouveau is in use.\nBut when trying to (re-)execute NVidia's installer (NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-256.53.run)\nit keeps complaining about Nouveau. I'm starting to run out of ideas, so any help would be welcome!\n\nA: Seems that once I got over this problem, I was able to switch to using a newer kernel (automatically installed by apt-get upgrade: 2.6.32-21 to 2.6.32-25), and with that kernel the Nouveau module was no longer in use (probably due to removing the xserver-xorg-video-nouveau package?).\nThen, after installing appropriate linux-headers packages, the NVIDIA installer agreed to proceed and it rebuilt the kernel module and took it into use.\nThen some dual-monitor configuration, and everything seems to be pretty smooth, finally. Whew. :-) \n(Problems with the non-NVIDIA drivers included: 1) for VGA output the image was in the wrong place horizontally; you couldn't get it right even by manually adjusting the monitor 2) colours (or contrast) for DVI and VGA output were very different. There's only one DVI output in the card so I need to use VGA for the other monitor.) \nI'm not sure if anyone will face exactly the same kind of mess that I did, but, to recap, for anyone else with the same or similar graphics card: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can get NVidia GeForce GT 210 to work just fine on Ubuntu 10.04.\n\n*Get the drivers directly from NVIDIA (as described here), but before installing them, get rid of Nouveau completely. \n\n\nEdit: Removing Nouveau drivers \nI had to set up my machine all over again (due to the system disk, an Intel X25-M SSD, breaking down and having to be replaced...), this time bypassing any eCryptfs problems, so now it's a bit clearer to me how exactly you can remove and disable the Nouveau drivers (to be able to install NVIDIA ones):\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\n*As described in this answer: edit /etc/default/grub and add the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"nouveau.modeset=0\" \n\n*sudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nAfter that, you should be able to install NVIDIA drivers without conflicts with Nouveau.\n\nA: The Ubuntu X team maintains a set of backported drivers here. You should try installing those otherwise you'll have to reinstall the drivers every time you get a kernel update.\n\nA: I had similar problem. try this :\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed nouveau using synaptic. \n\n*Download the nVIDIA driver\n\n*Reboot , in the grub menu , select \"recovery mode\"\n\n*Go to Run level 3 by typing telinit 3\n\n*install nvidia : sudo sh \n\n*I had to blacklist nouveau in sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf add this line blacklist nouveau\nthis worked for me.\nI tried this for GT 230\n\nA: I have a 210GT that has worked with zero problems in 10.04 through to 11.04 so far using the nvidia-current driver from the rpeository. In order for the drivers to work properly you may need yo create a new /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. to to that, open a terminal and type:\nsudo nvidsia-xconfig\n\nRunning the above command will backup the old xorg.conf file. Once the new file has been created, all you have to do is reboot.\n", "Q: ESI ESU 1808 soundcard support I need to know if the ESI ESU 1808 soundcard will work on my ubuntu, before I buy it. I've tried to google some answer, but could not find anything relevant.\n\nA: It would appear that the sound card is not compatible with Ubuntu (source: here). However that post is from October, 2007 a lot may have changed. Have you thought about contacting the manufacturer/retailer directly? Most offer some form of pre-sales support. Conversely you may want to get an Asus Xonar instead which are known to work very will with linux (and are great sound cards).\n", "Q: How can I install the Safari web browser? I want to install the Apple Safari browser on my Ubuntu 10.04 machine in order to test the latest HTML5 and CSS3 features of the browser. \nI believe it is possible to use WINE for this but I want to know which version WINE should be used and which version of Windows I should emulate. Will Wine be able to support all the CSS3 animations or should I install Winetricks ?\n\nA: For the latest HTML 5 features, you'll want to use Safari 5, not Safari 4.\nYour go-to resource for running applications in Wine is the Wine Application Database (AppDB), which incorporates invaluable test results from outside of the Ubuntu community and should have the most up-to-date information on compatibility.\nThe most recent test results report success running Safari 5 in Wine 1.3.2, which is available in the WineHQ Repository. Right now there are not any special installation instructions posted. Typically this means you don't have to do any special setup, but you should be open to the possibility that the users posting results for Safari 5 have wrongly assumed that you know to refer back to some part of the Safari 4 installation instructions. If things aren't working as well as reported, try applying the installation instructions for Safari 4.\n\nA: There are detailed instructions at: http://www.junauza.com/2010/02/installing-and-running-safari-4-on.html\n", "Q: What's the best way to get Python 2.5 and 2.7 Ubuntu 10.04 has only two supported Python versions 2.6 and 3.1.  Developers often need more, to test that their Python code works on 2.7, 2.5 (and maybe even 2.4 and older ones).  What's the best way to install those Python versions side-by-side on a lucid system?\nIs it Felix Krull's PPA, which I'm currently using?\nIncidentally, some important packages aren't available in those non-standard Pythons from the deadsnakes PPA:\n\n\n*\n\n*python-setuptools (but you can install python-setuptools-deadsnakes)\n\n*python-profiler\n\n\nA: Your best bet would probably be using debootstrap to create a chroot of an earlier Ubuntu version where 2.5 was supported, or use a virtual machine. \nInstalling it in Ubuntu alongside 2.6 may cause problems. \n\nA: I also use the fkrull's Deadsnakes PPA. I think it is the best way to get Python 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7 at this time. I have not run into any problems using it alongside the default Python2.6. It also helps to keep things clean if you use a virtualenv, especially for those versions of Python that are not the system default.\n", "Q: Keyboard layout switching unvoluntarily when opening new application I use three different keyboard layouts, USA, Can and Rus. My default layout is USA.\nI have set the keyboard layout to be system-wide instead of application specific because it allows me to keep track of only one status. However, whenever I open a new application, the system-wide layout is always reset to the default layout. For example, if my layout was set to Can and I opened vlc, the layout would then switch back to USA for the whole system. I don't quite understand how or why this could be a desirable behavior... \nDo you have any idea as how to get rid of this?\nIf not, where can I open up a feature request?\nEDIT: I did some more testing and in fact, the behavior seems inconsistent. Sometimes the layout will switch, sometimes it won't. I can't pinpoint what is the exact source of the issue.\nEDIT2: I think some applications do it, some don't.

My wife and I both like to listen to the same online audio stream.  That means we end up with multiple computers connecting to the same online stream at the same time.  It would be helpful if I could save on internet bandwidth by connecting to the internet stream on one computer/server and \"rebroadcasting\" it so that it's available to other computers in my house.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Why not connect to the internet stream from one computer and then use PulseAudio to provide the audio to the network?\nYou'll need to install paprefs for this, on the \"server\" (the computer connecting to the internet stream) and on each \"client\" (computer receiving audio data from the server) you wish to use. \npaprefs is a GUI program, but its options are a little opaque. The manpage is, as is too often the case, useless for figuring out the options. It does provide a Web address, http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/paprefs/ , which has a link to \"Documentation\" but contains no actual documentation. I will attempt to walk you through the configuration process, but my setup is different from yours so I may err. Hopefully someone will see it and correct it if I do.\nFirst, run paprefs on the server machine. Under \"Network Access\" tab, select:\n\"Enable network access to local sound devices\"\n\"Allow other machines on the LAN to discover local sound devices\", and\n\"Don't require authentication\"\nThere are two more options on that tab regarding DLNA/UPnp media streaming. I don't know what that is so I have left it alone.\nUnder \"Multicast/RTP\" tab, select:\n\"Enable Multicast/RTP sender\" and\n\"Create separate audio device for Multicast/RTP\"\nThat should do it for the server.\nFor each client, run paprefs and:\nUnder \"Network Access\" tab, select:\n\"Make discoverable PulseAudio network sound devices available locally\"\nUnder \"Multicast/RTP\" tab, select:\n\"Enable Multicast/RTP receiver\"\nThis should suffice for client configuration.\nWhen it's time to listen to your broadcast, connect the server to the internet stream in the usual way. Then open System→Preferences→Sound and select \"RTP Multicast\" from the \"Output\" tab.\nAfter that, on each client, open System→Preferences→Sound and look in the \"Input\" tab. It should contain an entry for an RTP Multicast from (server's hostname). I am not sure of the exact wording as I am not in a position to test it right at the moment. In any case, select the multicast, adjust the volume, and you should be hearing the broadcast (and any other audio) coming from the server.\nAs far as I know, there is no way to bind particular applications to particular inputs/outputs. If anyone knows of such a way, I would very much like to know about it. I have a question on the subject at How to clone audio output?.\n\nA: I've been looking into this too.  I want to broadcast my Pandora, MP3s, or whatever from one source to various netbooks and things connected to receivers throughout my house.  I haven't found the silver bullet yet, but here are some of my pursuits. \nVLC seems to be able to do it as long as you can capture the \"audio out,\" but that's dependent on your sound card.  \nAirfoil is an inexpensive commercial product which claims to be able to broadcast to various OSes, including Ubuntu.  However, I don't think you can broadcast from Ubuntu.  Broadcasting seems unstable from Win 7.\n", "Q: How do I change my monitor's resolution when using a KVM? I'm using 10.04 behind a KVM switch. The KVM is old and doesn't pass DDC through, so when the box boots up it just assumes I can't handle anything beyond 800x600. Apparently the xorg.conf is ignored, so I can't just hack monitor data directly into that. Is there a way to tell the box what my monitor is that will persist across reboots?\n\nA: Hardcoding an xorg.conf is the most traditional solution to dealing with this problem.  What is causing your xorg.conf to get overwritten?\nYou didn't mention what graphics hardware or video driver you're using, but if it is a KMS enabled driver, you may need to turn KMS off.\n", "Q: What are PPAs and how do I use them? I keep reading about Personal Package Archives ('PPAs') and people answer questions with a link to a PPA. What's the best way to use these? \n\nThere are multiple valid answers for this question spanning over several versions of Ubuntu. For your convenience, an index of each is below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 11.04 and newer  \n\n*Ubuntu 10.10  \n\n*Ubuntu 10.04  \n\n*Command Line\n\n\n\n*\n\n*What is a PPA?\n\n*Removing a PPA\n\nA: For Ubuntu 10.10\nWhile many find it easier to add PPAs using command line tools, this can be done through Ubuntu Software Center for those who prefer graphical interfaces. For this demo, we will be adding the PPA for the Banshee Team in order to get the latest stable release of Banshee.\nWe'll begin by opening the Ubuntu Software Center which can be found in the Applications menu.\nApplications > Ubuntu Software Center\n\n\nNow in Software Center, go to Edit > Software Sources\n\nYou will be asked to enter your administrative password.\n\nNow in Software Sources open the Other Software tab and press Add.\n\nIn this dialog, we will enter the PPA's information.\n\nThis information is found on the PPA's website in bold under the heading Adding this PPA to your system. For the Banshee PPA, it looks like this:\n\nNow we can close Software Sources and Software Center will automatically update so that you can access the new packages from the PPA.\n\nThe packages available from the PPA can be seen by expanding the Get Software menu in Software Center's left column.\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 10.04\nTo add a PPA in Ubuntu 10.04:\n\n*\n\n*Run System->Administration->Software Sources:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You will be prompted for your password. Note that you can only add a PPA if you are an administrator user due to the security risks and system wide consequences of adding a PPA. Enter your password into the dialog to continue:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Software Sources window, click on the 'Other Software' tab and click the 'Add...' button. This will bring up a prompt asking for the 'APT line':\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The text to paste into this box is found on the launchpad page in the 'Adding This PPA to your System' in bold letter.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Paste the line you copied into the text box in Software Sources (CTRL+V):\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the Software Sources window; you will be asked to reload your package information. Do this by clicking the 'Reload' button:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can now find software packages from this PPA in Ubuntu Software Centre:\n\n\n\nA: http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb  is my attempt at doing this for the Wine PPA.\nI'll note that Maverick changed and now I have to edit the instructions again (there is no more administration->software sources but instead you have to go there from Software Center).\nLaunchpad's built in instructions are a bit better than they were a year or so ago, but still pretty bad.\n\nA: For Information on PPA (Personal Package Archive) Visit Ubuntu help on PPA.\n\nThere is Y PPA Manager available for Ubuntu. It is a GUI tool to manage PPAs in the best possible way.\nTo install y-ppa-manager run following command in the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install y-ppa-manager\n\nFor more information and key-features, visit https://launchpad.net/y-ppa-manager.\n\nHow to find PPA? (Solution when apt unable to locate package) \nYou can find PPA from launchpad page as suggested in following image:\n\n\n\nYou can find PPA from Ubuntuupdates -Package Search as shown in the following picture:\n\n\n\nThen Add repository from terminal as following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:<someppa/ppa>\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: What is a PPA?\nIt's all very simple once you get the hang of it.  I have run into problems here and there, but generally speaking, PPA's are the only way to get your software updated in Ubuntu between distro releases (don't get me into a rant about that).  It's too much to explain here, so I will point you to some worthwhile documentation.  But first, a few simple rules:\nKnow what you're installing.  Most likely you'll use Launchpad for the majority of your PPA needs, but even so it can be dangerous to your computer.  Usually the worry for me is not malicious intent, but conflicting packages.  If package A requires a modified version of ffmpeg, and package B in a different repository requires a modified version of ffmpeg too, well, now there's a good chance you might not be able to watch videos, for example, with package A or B or at all.\nKeep in mind that anyone can create a PPA, even you.  Just because a person signs the Code of Conduct doesn't mean they know what they're doing.  On Launchpad there is not only updates to stable releases, but also beta and alpha software, and even stuff that doesn't quite work at all yet.  There are many useful repositories, such as to get the latest Nvidia drivers or the current stable release of Pidgin.  Then again, there's stuff that some guy made in his basement for himself and a couple of friends.\nThat said, the Ubuntu documentation web pages should have everything you need to know in a pretty understandable format.\nRepositories in Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu\nSoftware management: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoftwareManagement\nRepositories and the command line: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine\nA quick note: I assume you're using Ubuntu 10.04.  If you're using 10.10 there is no more \"Software Sources\" in your menu, even though it is referred to in some of the documentation.  To access it simply open the Synaptic Package Manager then select Settings -> Repositories from the menu.\nGood Luck and I hope this was helpful.\nEdit: Please know that installing software through the Ubuntu Software Center can be troublesome.  This is because it does not tell you what dependencies a particular app you want to install requires.  That is, you could install the entire KDE desktop, hundreds of MB's worth of stuff, just to get a screen ruler or firewall configurator.  I learned this the hard way...  For example, type \"kruler\" in the search box and you will see the final install size as almost 100 MB.  At least pay close attention to the final install size if you insist on using the USC.  Most new users are unfamiliar with the concepts of window managers and desktop environments having only known Windows, so be careful about simply relying on USC and not learning all about PPAs, which is what I recommend.  It's a little more work and this is just my opinion, but you'll probably be happy you did! :)\n\nA: One thing to keep in mind about using PPAs is that when you add a PPA to your Software Sources, you're giving Administrative access (root) to everyone that can upload to that PPA. Packages in PPAs have access to your entire system as they get installed (just like a regular package from the main Ubuntu Archive), so always decide if you trust a PPA before you add it to your system.\n\nA: Removing a PPA with ppa-purge \nIt may not be safe to just disable any PPA added to our sources by removing it from sources.list or by unticking the PPA in our Software Sources settings. It would then be a much better idea to also remove all packages that were installed from this PPA and replace them with Ubuntu default packages.\nTo do so we have the script ppa-purge  that will not only remove the unwanted PPA but also will replace packages that were installed from this PPA by the default Ubuntu versions. After installation simply run\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:<lp-name>/<ppa-name>\n\nwhere <lp-name>/<ppa-name> is the same name we entered to our sources when adding this PPA. The PPA will then be removed. Packages installed from this PPA will be replaced by default Ubuntu packages (installed packages that are not in the default repositories will not be deleted).\n\nA: For Ubuntu 11.04 and newer\nBefore adding a PPA you should be aware of some of the risks involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\nAlways remember that PPAs are provided by the community, you should be aware of the possible risks before just adding a PPA.\n\n\n*\n\n*First open the dash by either clicking on the Home button (On the top-left Corner) or pressing the Super Key .\n\n\n*Search for 'Software Center' and launch the Ubuntu software center.\n\n\n*Move the mouse to the top panel where the name of the application is written.\n\n*Now Go to the Edit menu and select Software Sources.\n\nFor newer versions,  right click and click Software and Updates\n\nThen, click Other Software,\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter your password when prompted.\n\n\n*Switch to the 'Other Software' tab.\n\n\n*Now  click 'Add', a box will appear.\n\n\n*You have to enter the PPA in the box. It can be found in BOLD on the launchpad page.\n\n\n\n*Now click 'Add source' and close the Software Sources. The cache will be refreshed \n\n\n*Now install the software from the software center.\n\n\nA: If you are having a hard time figuring out the correct add-apt-repository command to run, someone has created a script called ppasearch to make this task easier. To install ppasearch, you will need to run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:wrinkliez/ppasearch\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ppasearch\n\nIf you are on maverick, you can manually download and install the lucid deb. It should work fine.\nThis will add the ppasearch PPA (and its key) and install the package. You can run the script by typing the following command in a terminal:\nppasearch PPANAME\nSo to find the Cardapio team PPA, you might run:\nppasearch cardapio\nAs you can see from the screenshot below, you are then presented with a list of matching PPAs. Once you select the PPA you want, it will get added by the script by using add-apt-repository. ppasearch will even run sudo apt-get update for you if you wish to update your sources.\n\nThere is also a video of the script in action, but it is slightly out-of-date.\nThis script should make it easy for you to add PPAs and their keys without having to search around Launchpad.\n\nA: What is PPA?\nPPAs are for non standard software/updates. They are generally used by people who want the latest and greatest. If you are going extra lengths to get this kind of software, then you are expected to know what you are doing. The selection in the Software Centre is ample for most human beings.\nCommand Line\nOn the command line you can add a PPA using add-apt-repository, e.g.:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa\n\nTo remove a PPA remove the corresponding files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d (this does not remove the packages you installed from the PPA). To see the packages available from a PPA or remove packages installed from a PPA press the \"Origin\" button on the lower left of the Synaptic window and choose the PPA from the list.\nWith can use the usual Software Sources dialog and add ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa where it asks for a APT line and enable or disable them just like other repositories.\nAs anybody can create a PPA there's no guarantee for quality or security of a PPA - just like with any other unofficial software source you have to decide yourself if a PPA it's trustworthy or not. And like any other unofficial software packages from a PPA can cause all sorts of difficulties especially when upgrading to a new release of Ubuntu.\n\nIf you get an error that the add-apt-repository command could not be found:\n\n*\n\n*On 12.04 and earlier, install the python-software-properties package:\n  sudo apt-get install python-software-properties\n\n\n\n*On 14.04 and later:\n  sudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\n", "Q: Why does the XFORCEVESA command throw me onto the command line? Hey all.

Help! \n\nA: As a solution to your immediate problem you can use nomodeset in your boot options instead of xforcevesa.\nI'd also report your problems to the xorg bug list: https://bugs.launchpad.net/xorg and upstream at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=xorg making sure to give the reports as much information about your hardware as possible.\nYou might be asked to try out the updated xorg/drivers and you can find some of these available here: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa which will upgrade various things to their latest versions.\n", "Q: 2 network interfaces connected to internet. Choose the one to use according to the domain name Question inspired from here\nScenario\nI live in a house near my university. That said, students wifi can reach my home so I usually use that even from home. The problem is, being a wifi managed by university sysadmins, it's not possible to connect to some dns (e.g. file uploading domains like rapidshare or megaupload).\nThe good news is I also have an USB internet key that I can use, but, basically that's a scam like all internet mobile plans in Italy because after 20GB they'll cut off my bandwith.\nFinally...the question\nTo optimize my bandwith usage I want to say to my Ubuntu: if I connect to *.domain.com use this interface, otherwise use the other one. For the sake of this question let's call wifi wlan0 and usb internet key ppp0.\nP.S.: it's a really specific question. Do not suggest things like \"use Tor, dude\". I do not want to abuse the university wifi. I actually don't know if that is even possibile with Tor...but still... :)\n\nA: If your example domain \"*.domain.com\" has a static IP address block, you can add a static route to your routing table like:\nme@thiscomputer:~$ whois domain.com\n\nThis should give you some contact information for the owners of domain.com. You can contact them to find out their network address. This address will probably be in CIDR format where:\n192.168.0.0/24 == \"The set of IP addresses from 192.168.0.1 up to 192.168.0.254\". The number after the slash is the number of bits in the network portion of the address. This is equivalent to a netmask of 255.255.255.0.\nYou could also use dig to look up some host addresses and attempt to deduce the netblock from that, or just add routes to discrete hosts, but I would not recommend it.\nWith the address information in hand, you can then add a static route like so:\nme@thiscomputer:~$ sudo ip route add inet 10.0.0.0/24 dev ppp0\n\nIRL it will probably not work exactly like this, consult the manpage for the ip command or the route command (these are different commands which do the same thing, route is older and part of coreutils) to see how to do it right.\nIf the domain's address is not static (configured by DHCP for example) which seems unlikely for a site with a persistent A record, you could work the above method into a cron job running at some interval shorter than the site's DHCP lease. You'd likely have to contact the site's administrator to get this information, or just experiment. If the job runs once a day, that would probably be sufficiently frequent.\n\nA: Is there a web proxy on your university network? If so, use it for normal web browsing, but not to access blocked sites.\nOtherwise, it's possible, but not very easy. Routing (i.e. deciding where to send packets to) is performed at the IP level, which only knows about IP addresses. On the other hand, your routing requirement is based on a host name, but the layer that knows about the names has no control over routing.\nI think any solution will involve a web proxy. (I'm assuming that for other protocols, you'll always use a particular network.) The web proxy itself isn't going to do anything other than relay requests, so any will do: a big one (squid), one specialized for cacheing (wwwoffle), a simple tiny one (tinyproxy), etc. (aptitude search web proxy; aptitude search http proxy).\nNow, for the solution I'm proposing (there may be other ways), don't configure your proxy in any special way (i.e. make it relay all requests), but run it as a dedicated user: create a user alt-routed with no special privilege, and arrange for the proxy to run as this user.\nThen, make wlan0 the default route. Then set up iptables and install the iproute package. The rules you want are to direct outgoing packets that came from a process running as the alt-route-user to the ppp0 interface. There's no direct way to do it, but it can be done by:\n\n\n*\n\n*specially marking (with the mark 1) outgoing packets from user alt-routed;\n\n*using a different routing table (table 1) for packets marked with this mark;\n\n*routing everything to the alternate interface in this table.\n\n\nIf I understand the documentation correctly, this should work:\niptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner alt-routed -o wlan0 -j MARK --set-mark 1\nip rule add fwmark 1 table 1\nip route add 0.0.0.0/0 table 1 dev ppp0\n\nNote that this is well beyond my common usage of these tools, so I might have gotten these commands completely wrong. Confirmations or corrections welcome.\nAny program you run as alt-routed will access the Internet via ppp0 instead of the default wlan0.\nFinally, configure your browsers to go through the proxy for sites that you want to access over ppp0, and not to go through the proxy for sites that you want to access through wlan0. There are several ways to do that, depending on what browser(s) you're targetting and whether you want a GUI or are willing to edit a configuration file.\n", "Q: How do I fix Current Pending Sector Count From the SMART Data, it shows that I have 3 pending sector counts. (Running Ubuntu Maverick.)\nI tried following a forums link regarding how to solve that, but I'm not able to identify the exact sector count to write to that sector. I've run the full self test from the Disk Utility, but the disk Utility does not show the exact sector number in Maverick, not sure about earlier versions though. Has this changed in Maverick?\nHow do I identify the sector and fix that pending count? Is that tip in the forums safe?\nPS:\nI do have other issues with \"Reallocated Sector Count\" , from what I've googled, it's not fixable.. Is there any way to prevent it from rising?\n\nA: This is actually a long comment ;-)\nIMO the filesystem should automatically take care of it in due course, especially since you have run the self test. As you can see it states remapping is done on the event of write failure so the next time it tries to attempt to write to it, it will get remapped. \nCould you state the larger purpose behind doing this ? Apart from the concern on the blocks requiring remapping, is there any other annoyance / problem you are trying to solve by doing this ?\nThe tip in the ubuntuforums post you have quoted is safe so long as you know exactly which sector has gone bad and have a compelling reason to fix it. Typically the sector # is not reported even by file checking programs since it is abstracted and handled internally by the file system.\nBut if you must find the offending badblocks you can use the below steps :\n\n\n*\n\n*Note the device file corresponding to file system. This is of the form /dev/hdc or /dev/sdb depending on the disk type. This is displayed in the Disk Utility (System -> Administration -> Disk Utility). If you click on the disk name in the list displayed in the left-side panel, the device name can be read against \"Device :\" on the right.\n\n*Unmount all the file-systems in that disk. The following command should return no output.\nmount | grep -i <device-name>\n\n\n*Run the following command\nbadblocks -sv -b 512 <device-name>\n\nNote The -b 512 is to align blocksize to 512 so you can use the number reported by this command as input to dd as explained in the forums post\nI would not recommend all the above since it is anyway taken care of by the normal disk operations.\n\nA: worse case you can always do this:\nUnmount the disk or array and stop any array.\ndd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdX iflag=direct,sync oflag=direct,sync\n\nIt will take a long time, but should work.\nIdeally you could query the hard drive growth defect list (glist), but I haven't figured out how to do that.\n\nA: It looks like the conv=noerror option helps.  When there is an i/o error it looks like this option forces dd to retry til it completes the read/write.  I created a source file with the following command for each of the bad blocks found by the badblocks command (given by Kaushik above), and it cleared the \"Current Pending Sector Count\" (\"waiting to be remapped\") to zero from 5.  \nsudo dd bs=512 count=1 conv=noerror ibs=512 obs=512 if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sda iflag=direct,sync oflag=direct,sync skip=3186809 seek=3186809\n\n\nA: When this exceeds 0 it is typically a sign of imminent drive failure. I do not believe this can be fixed without replacing the hard disk.\nRefer to http://kb.acronis.com/content/9133?nocache=1\n", "Q: Sync calendar and contacts with Android smartphone I use Thunderbird with Lighting calendar addon, which stores calendar data in iCalendar format. \nHow can I synchronize this calendar and Thunderbird contacts with Android based smartphone (HTC Wildfire).\nI know I can use Google Account, but I'd prefer to use bluetooth or even better, local access via wi-fi (no internet connection available).\nIs there any complete Ubuntu smartphone synchronization guide somewhere?\n\nA: I'm afraid there's no easy solution... Android phones are meant to be used with internet access, and to synchronize with the clouds (basically: with the Google cloud, but you could do it with some other things, like an exchange server or UbuntuOne account).\nIn any case, synchronizing your phone directly to a local computer is not the way Android works.\nOffhand, I think you could make a exchange-like server on your computer (like Zimbra, or Open-Xchange), and make both your Thunderbird and Android sync to it...\nI'm not sure it would work, and I actually think it's overkill, but... Honestly, I don't see anything else :-(\n\nA: Use gContactSync thunderbird add-on for the Google Contacts sync:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/8451/\nAnd for the Google Calendar synchronisation you should use \"Provider for Google Calendar\" for lightning / sunbird:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/provider-for-google-calendar/\n\nA: It is not perfect but this is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had installed Windows XP as a guest OS on VirtualBox on my Ubuntu machine. Then I installed MyPhoneExplorer on Windows XP. I had also created a folder named VirtualBoxFolder, which I can access both from Ubuntu and from Windows.\n\n*I created a new Calendar in Thunderbird/Lightning. This calendar is On the Network, and the address is \"file:///home/USER/VirtualBoxFolder/CALENDAR_NAME.ics\" (without quotes; you must put your Ubuntu username and your calendar name instead of mine).\n\n*Then I configured MyPhoneExplorer to syncronize with that calendar. So I get acces from my HTC Wildfire to the same calendar as my Lightning has. It runs in the two ways (from HTC to the PC and from the PC to the HTC device).\n\n*I can also locate the calendar in a DropBox directory instead of the VirtualBox, but I do not like to become network-dependent.\nHope this will help.\n\nA: UbuntuOne for mobile devices supports contacts sync.

How to fix? Once I use an external CRT display (explicitly disabling it before shutting down does not help) with my laptop, then when I next start my laptop without any external display attached, mouse cursor is invisible (but works, i still can click buttons, but can't track where the cursor is now).

It also has a stand-alone window when left-clicked with lots of options.  X-tile has recently been fixed to be compatible with Compiz viewports, but be warned that the display size options may need to be tweaked if you use an unconventional desktop layout, such as AWN dock, auto-hide panels, etc.  Don't worry, it's all done through a simple GUI interface.\nYou can find it here: http://linux-apps.com/content/show.php/X+Tile?content=99624\nPYwo: Python window organizer.

And it is awesome.  Once you set your keyboard shortcuts you can use this program to assign simple mouse gestures to them.  For example, if Ctrl+Alt+L is your shortcut to tile a single window to left-top of the screen, you can make an Easystroke rule that when you hold the right mouse button and draw a line up and left the selected window gets tiled as if you hit the keys.  This program also offers application specific gestures, allowing you to set commands for web browsers, file managers, and so on.

As per title, I wish to know if I can, after a successful 32bit setup and consequent software installations, update to a 64bit version.\nI know how to partition (actually one of the solutions is to set /, /etc, /home, /var/www, and /opt as separate partitions) and I know that a clean install is way better than a dirty one, yet I would like to know if/how it's possible to do that.\n\nA: No you can not upgrade from 32 bit to 64 bit.  It has to be a clean (fresh) install\nBefore you do make sure that your system is capable of a 64bit operating system, and check the minimum requirement for Ubuntu 64. You can do so Here\nThe terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's CPU, handles information. The 64-bit version handles large amounts of RAM much better than a 32-bit system. If you are running a 32-bit version of Ubuntu, you can only perform an upgrade to another 32-bit version of Ubuntu. Similarly, if you are running a 64-bit version of Ubuntu, you can only perform an upgrade to another 64-bit version of Ubuntu.\nIf you want to move from 32-bit Ubuntu to a 64-bit Ubuntu, you'll need to back up your files, do a clean install of 64-bit Ubuntu.\n\nA: You will find a  clean install a lot less hassle than any other unusual, obscure, unsupported method.\nYour suggest of partitioning the config files, home directories, etc is probably the best idea, and it is possible to install the same packages on a clean install as on another install.\nOn the other hand, what you requested is possible, there is a little guide for Debian based systems but remember \"this really is for professional-level sysadmins\" and \"this procedure is, in every possible respect, a bad idea. If it eats your firstborn, please don't come crying to me\"... (so good luck)\n\nA: You can now do this fairly easily with recent installers (at least with 13.10 which I just used). Boot into the 64-bit image DVD (or USB drive or whatever) and choose the first option to reinstall, keeping your personal files. This works even if you don't have a separate /home partition.\nThis will reinstall most of the system including apps, but it takes a list of your installed packages beforehand to reinstall them from repo, so as long as a package has a 64-bit version available to it at the time, you should end up with most of your apps when you reboot. In my experience a few didn't get installed - mainly those that had been installed through 3rd party repos such as Google Chrome - but it doesn't take long to install these manually afterwards.\n\nA: I shall cast raise dead, because this thread is one of the top results for \"upgrade ubuntu to 64 bits\", and the chosen answer, while admittedly the smart choice, is not the full story.\nIt is, in fact, possible to upgrade Ubuntu from 32 to 64 bits. You can do it. \nI just finished doing such an upgrade. \nThat said, the words \"can\" and \"should\" look nothing alike, and that is also true of an upgrade and a fresh installation. Can you do it? Yes. Should you do it? Eeeeeh...\nUpgrading from 32 to 64 bits without explodifying my system took me the better part of a week. Including manually fixing 600+ broken packages in aptitude, because the automatic resolver started looping, apparently due to PERL:i386 (required by installed packages) being incompatible with PERL:amd64 (required by the packages you are trying to install). \nThis was after I manually installed a bunch of packages, including the correct version of PERL, to fix an apt screwup: you see, apt-get -f install (which is required to get a mostly-working 64-bits system) will uninstall PERL32 in order to install PERL64... Then merrily proceed to try removing 1234 other packages before getting 'round to actually reinstalling PERL. Needless to say, this is not a good idea, when a sizable portion of the apt system (an lots of other things, really) depends on a working PERL.\nThe reinstallation was performed entirely from console (aptitude FTW, of course), because the console pretty much only requires a working bash (and working curses for aptitude, but if you try to do this, curses will be plentiful, you can bet on it), whereas X requires... Way too much stuff to trust it to keep working while you perform open heart surgery on your system.\nAll that said, the following Debian article explains how to cross-grade your system:\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/CrossGrading\nThis is not the same article described in the original accepted answer, because in the mean time things have changed, mostly for the better.\nThe basics are:\n dpkg --add-architecture amd64\n\n apt-get update\n\n apt-get install linux-image-amd64:amd64\n\n reboot\n\n apt-get clean\n\n apt-get --download-only install dpkg:amd64 tar:amd64 apt:amd64\n\n dpkg --install /var/cache/apt/archives/*_amd64.deb\n\nAt which point you will be able to do this:\ndpkg --print-architecture \n\nResulting in the following line:\namd64\n\nYay. Ubuntu thinks it's a proper 64-bits system. How cute. You know better, of course.\nNow you can run:\napt-get update\n\nThis will download the list of all 64-bits packages, which you will need to finish crossgrading your system.\nAt this point, your system acts very much like nothing happened, except that your ability to install anything is well and truly broken. \nYou see, you now have multiple i386 packages that don't have an actual multiarch equivalent, so you will be stuck with various technically \"unavailable\" dependencies. You already have them installed, so your system will run, but at this stage... I wouldn't trust apt any farther than I can throw it.\nThe article recognizes the need for a fix, and suggests you do so thusly:\n apt-get -f install\n\nThis will cause apt to try and fix the ungodly mess you just made. And believe me, you just made an ungodly mess.\nOne minor hiccup of this procedure is that it will cause portions of the apt system (and other critical subsystems) to be uninstalled partway through, causing errors during the remainder of the process (you don't say), and leaving you up the creek. \nLuckily, not without a paddle. You can install the now-missing packages via:\ndpkg -i/var/cache/apt/archives/(package)*amd64.deb\n\nNote that, at least for me, the network stopped working at one... Well, several... Points. This was due to apt removing a number of packages that are necessary to keep your network working (such as your dhcp client). \nThen, apt cheerfully informed me that it needed to download some additional packages. Without a working network.\nIf this sounds like you are officially boned... Well, that's because you are. \nUnless you have a wired nework (your WiFi packages have already been uninstalled, and WiFI is rather more complicated to get to work anyway), know its configuration information, and are able to use ifconfig, route, etc.\nJust keep trying apt-get -f install until you get no more errors. \nAfter apt is satisfied with the state of your system you can run aptitude and manually fix the 600 broken packages you will find. Apparently apt and aptitude have different ideas of what a working system looks like. Don't ask me why.\nAlso, as I mentioned, the aptitude resolver enters an infinite loop if you try to let it do its thing automatically. Can't blame it, really, it was designed to start on a working system and help the user add or remove some packages, not fix this kind of abomination.\nThis is the part that took me several days to fix, a little bit at a time, using a different system to occasionally go online and make sure I wasn't accidentally reformatting the family dog.\nIf all this hasn't discouraged you yet, note that this was my second attempt at a live upgrade. \nThe first one ended with an mkfs. \nHint, hint, big fscking hint. Or rather, big mkfsing hint.\nBut again, it actually worked in the end. \nThe system is running, it mostly uses 64-bits packages (there are a couple of exceptions that I will have to fix eventually), and can run applications requiring a 64-bits installation.\nIt is possible. \nIf it's your only option, for whatever reason, you can do it by following the procedure described above - if you have the required domain knowledge. \nIf you don't know the difference between sync and rsync, if you aren't comfortable with insmod, if you don't know how to use ifconfig, if you don't routinely prefer aptitude to the graphical installer whose name escapes me at the moment... Just make a backup of your data and install from scratch. \nIt's way less painful, it will save you a lot of time, and it will leave you with a fresh installation, without any unexpected leftovers ready to bite you in the rear 11 months from now.\nIf you already made a backup of the stuff you don't want to lose, and have no other choice - or just like learning by banging your head against things (particularly the wall)... Well, you can try.\nIt might even work.\n\nA: It is possible to upgrade ubuntu 32bit to 64bit, it will have lots and lots of unwanted files, and you have to clean it manually. Truth is \"HEADACHE\".\nI WILL NEVER/NOT RECOMMEND FOR NEW ONES.\nWhat ever you do, first back-up your important data. Then go for research with os.\nFirst try live-cd of 64bit. If it works go for fresh install, recommended.\nAlso there are some software, which are still 32bit. So to install 32bit software on a 64bit os, we need some backward processing.. these will also a bad thing.\nThink for some time : whats your requirement, what you are going to do, next plan/work with 64bit os.\n\nA: This might be a much more reasonable thing to do once the multiarch spec is implemented.  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchSpec -- currently postponed to 11.04, but keep in mind it's been postponed for about 6 releases now.  That said, actual progress was made in 10.10, so maybe it'll happen this time.\nUntil then, don't bother.  Backup your data, repartition if you want, and reinstall.\n\nA: Your OS is still 32bit as you upgraded from a 32bit - see the answer in the comment for further information.\n\nby the way is it possible for the coexistence of 32 bit Win and 64 bit\n  Ubuntu?\n\nAbsolutely - it's called a dualboot - you would have the option at login to use either one. \nDownload and burn the 64 bit iso and boot with it, it will prompt you with various options - you would want to choose the Install alongside option.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\n\nA: I just tried the solution suggested above by Nick (Oct 19'13): Using the Ubuntu 64-bit Live CD to do a 64-bit reinstall.\nI used the Ubuntu 14.04.4 Live CD. But if the first option is indeed called a \"reinstall\", it more precisely appears as:  \nErase Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS and reinstall  \nWarning: This will delete all your Ubuntu 14.04 programs, documents,\nphotos, music, and all other files.  \n\nThe two other options offered by the installer on the Live CD are:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Install alongside (dual boot option)\n\n*Erase disk and install Ubuntu \n\n\nTo be real sure, I tried with a test disk, and indeed, the first thing the \"reinstall\" option does is to reformat the existing ext4 partition. No luck.\nSo I'm afraid the \"upgrade in-place to 64-bit\" solution Nick suggested doesn't exist anymore in 14.04.\nAnd BTW, Canonical, I hardly see the point for the installer having both the so-called \"reinstall\" option and the \"Erase disk and install\" one. Both seem to do about the same thing.  \nToo bad, since such an upgrade-to-64-bit-in-place option could have been real nice!\n\nA: There is an automated tool capable of doing this:\nhttps://github.com/pbkwee/distrorejuve\nSee --help; use --to-64bit switch\n\nA: You need to do a fresh install with the 64bit version of Ubuntu.   It is possible to have 32bit windows and 64bit Ubuntu, as long as they are not sharing the same disk or partition, for obvious reasons.   Refer to the documentation for howto on dual-booting.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\nIt is important that the CPU on the machine you're installing onto supports 64bit instruction set (which most modern CPUs should by now)\n", "Q: How can I easily use the gcc compiler for arm for building in a development IDE? I would like to replace the non-open lpcxpresso IDE with a free IDE. Any pointers how to do it best? How can I point one of the existing IDEs to use the arm gcc compiler?\n\nA: I'm by no means an expert on the subject, but hopefully I can point you in the right direction. As far as IDEs go, there is a GNU ARM plugin for the Eclipse IDE. It is a  Manged Build Extension that supports a number of GNU ARM Toolchains like CodeSourcery G++ Lite, GNUARM, WinARM, Yagarto, devkitPro.\nOutside of an IDE, you could consider running a QEMU ARM image. A discussion on how to setup a QEMU ARM image and to build ARM packages with it can be found here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/BuildArmPackages\n\nA: The only free Linux choice is to run eclipse/arm-elf-gcc using the makefile project option of this IDE, where you will write your own makefile. The drawbacks are the lack of ready to debug feature, so you will need to use OpenOCD, there is plenty of info on the internet.\nAs second choice, you could run a CoIDE over wine or virtual machine, and use their own debugger. This IDE only works on Cortex M3 chips, is free, has a open-hardware debug probe and its use is extremely easy.\n", "Q: Disk very slow after going from 9.04 to 10.04 My disk is very slow after I installed ubuntu 10.04 over my old 9.04.

Maybe a server kernel?\n", "Q: What if I run a virus/trojan Windows EXE on Ubuntu with Wine? I've got a file said to contain information I was looking for. Unfortunately it is an executable instead of DOC (as it was meant to be) and the site I've download it from looks suspicious for me. If I was not using Linux, I'd run it on a VM or a separate PC. But running Linux, do I need to worry, or can I just run it with Wine? Can Wine system be infected?\n\nA: simple way to \"secure\" wine is in winecfg tell all the desktop integration folders to point to your .wine folder and remove drives other than the drive_c inside the .wine folder.\n\nA: The news is only slightly better than it is on Windows.  If you run the executable, it can do anything an executable can, up to and including getting whatever data is in your home folder.\nThe good news is that most Windows viruses aren't (yet) written in a way to work well on Wine.  In some cases you can delete the wine folder and be otherwise unaffected.\nThe bad news is that a wine executable is an executable in the full Linux sense -- there's nothing stopping it from doing anything a malicious shell script might, including escaping the .wine folder.\nWine has a wiki page on securing Wine here: http://wiki.winehq.org/SecuringWine -- partial measures you can take include things like scanning a file with ClamAV before running it.\n\nA: There was an ancient article about this 5 years ago. Short version: Almost all Windows viruses aren't written to run well on Wine. Maybe Wine has gotten better, but it's not the sort of compatibility that Wine is looking to offer.\nThere are a couple viruses that infect both Windows & Linux but they're very very rare and didn't spread all that well.\n\nA: It is not so much viruses but rootkits that are dangerous to Linux.

It is a D-Link Wireless WNA-1330 PCMCIA Card. When I installed Ubuntu 8.04, the wireless connectivity worked just fine without issue to my DSL router (that has a DHCP server on it). I was able to connect to the DSL router and surf the web.\nI then ran the upgrade process to 10.04 in the Package/Update Manager. After the upgrade, the wireless card ceased to work. It would light up like it should, and it would see the network of wireless DSL routers in my neighborhood, but not let me connect with the WEP key.\nWhen I checked the logs, I found it was timing out in trying to get an IP address for some reason. So, I read that I should set it to a static IP.\nI set it to a static IP address and then it connected properly to the wireless router. The DSL router's network page also showed the connection. But then when I tried to surf the web, it wouldn't work. I tried pinging multiple hosts and all I could do was ping the DSL router 192.168.1.1. I also had packet loss when pinging that router.\nSo, I changed the config to use Google's Public DNS (8.8.8.8) and reconnected the wireless. This time, I could ping multiple sites on the web (with some packet loss) but could not browse them with the web browser. As well, I still cannot browse my router's management page on 192.168.1.1.\nWhat do you think is going on?\n\nA: This is a known problem for some Atheros chipsets. The driver was changed from madwifi to ath5k. While the former used to work perfectly, the latter fails for most people. Still it is default.\nIf lsmod | grep ath5k outputs anything, it might be your problem, too.\nHere's what you can do to fix it: Delete /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ath_pci.conf and edit /etc/modprobe.d/backlist.conf to add\nblacklist ath5k\n\nto the end.\nNow get the latest madwifi driver from http://snapshots.madwifi-project.org, unpack it, change into the newly created directory and run these lines\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nmake && sudo make install\n\nNow reboot, run\nsudo modprobe ath_pci\n\nadd the ath_pci to /etc/modules and reboot again. You should now be fully switched to the new driver.\n\nA: What Jorge Castro said is the next best thing to do after you have tried the latest available ath5k driver. There have been many updates to the driver since the kernel you are running. The following command will fetch the latest available ath5k driver compiled for your kernel (all latest wireless drivers for that matter):\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-lucid-generic\n\nReboot after that and try connecting again. If issues persist - proceed as Jorge wrote.\n\nA: First off I would stick with DHCP if that's how it's supposed to be working.  Make sure the proprietary driver is enabled for the wireless adapter in System > Administration > Hardware Drivers.  If it's still not working, try booting from a live ubuntu CD/USB and see if it works from there.  If it does work there, you'll know that something is broken on your specific install; Maybe you have lingering ndiswrapper drivers or something else.\n\nA: I had the same problem with a D-Link wireless adapter card when I upgraded to 10.04. Before the upgrade, things worked perfectly, but after, nothing would connect. I could see the SSIDs from wireless access points but couldn't connect.\nThe only way I was able to fix the issue was to install and configure Ndiswrapper (a tool that allows you to use the windows drivers for your wireless card). After I did that, everything works fine. I think that in the upgrade to 10.04, they found that the existing wireless drivers were conflicting with other libraries that the devs wanted in 10.04, so they decided to actually remove the drivers for these wireless cards in the installation/upgrade. I'm not 100% certain that this is what is wrong in your issue, but I would say definitely try Ndiswrapper to see if it fixes the issue. It sounds like a driver problem.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem with a Windows-PC till I found out, that my router somehow reset it's dhcp-configuration and only offered 20 dhc-leases instead of 70 (so there weren't enough leases for this computer, all the other computers worked fine). So you may want to check your router configuration first...\n\nA: Try turn off ipv6 support altogether. It can mess up with your configuration.\n", "Q: Why is mainstream Ubuntu still i386-compiled? I pretty much believe (am I wrong?) that over 90% (if not over 99.9%) of Ubuntu 10.x i386 installations are run on i686 computers. So why is Ubuntu still not i686-optimized?\nThe only case I can imagine, when one's install modern Ubuntu on i386 machine is a low-end netbook on something like Geode CPU. So, if Canonical guys would like to support those, then why not to leave \"Netbook Remix\" i386 and make mainstream desktop Ubuntu i686?\n\nA: New releases of Ubuntu(10.10 and above) won't work on anything older than i686. http://princessleia.com/journal/?p=2989\n\nA: During the 10.10 development cycle the decision was made to drop support for i386 and i486 entirely.  You can see the original specification here: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/foundations-m-686-compile.  I believe support may have been dropped for i586 as well, although that was a bit more controversial.\nImportantly, this wasn't just kernel optimizations (686-compiled kernels had been available long before), but every package in the archive.\nHowever, the name i386 for the 32-bit version of Ubuntu still lingers around in a few places, such as in package description fields (which are built for arches \"i386\" and \"amd64\" rather than \"32bit\" and \"64bit\").  These are just cosmetic issues in technical parts of the distro, however, and for a whole host of reasons aren't worth updating.\n", "Q: What are the differences between regular processes and services? What are the differences between regular processes (like firefox, gimp, skype, etc.)  and services (httpd, mysqld, etc.)? Obviously, services are different in their function, but I'm really wondering what's going on under the hood at the OS level? Are they treated in any different way?\n\nA: Under the hood, services are ordinary processes. What sets them apart is what they do and how they are started (but it's not a hard-and-fast definition). Services typically don't have a user interface, and are typically started when the system boots and run in the background, listening to requests coming from other programs or through the network. Such processes are called daemons in the unix world.\nThere's a more general definition of service that's more conceptual: a service is a feature that your computer provides. This definition roughly matches what is managed by the service command. Many services are provided by daemons, but that's not always the case. For example the gdm service (the default login manager) is provided by a process that's not really a daemon (it has a user interface for you to type your password). Services like console-setup, mountall or networking (to take examples from /etc/init) aren't provided by continuously running processes, but are enabled and disabled by running some state-changing commands.\nAnother somewhat related concept is that of servers. A server is a program that listens to connections from other programs. (The connections might come through the network or by various local communication means.) Many servers are daemons, but a short-lived program can be a server and won't be considered a daemon; a program with a user interface also won't be considered a daemon. For example, the Emacs editor can run a server that listens to external requests to open files (i.e. running emacsclient myfile opens a file in a running instance of Emacs by contacting its associated emascsserver process); Emacs can start in daemon mode, meaning that the server is started but no GUI (a window will be opened when you open a file). By extension, a server computer is a computer whose main purpose is to run server programs.\n", "Q: MagiX export project to AVI The whole day I struggled hard for a presentation of a video that I need it for tomorrow. When I am trying to export that project to AVI format, its throwing me an error message stating:\nDuring export with an external codec, an error has occured. Please check and adjust the export settings...\nHow can I overcome this?\n\nA: I'm not familiar with Magix system, but if this project is able to output successfully into ANY video format, then your best bet is to export the video, then transfer with ffmpeg.\nThere is a free GUI utility for ffmpeg called winff , available from the default ubuntu repositories. \nsudo aptitude install winff\n\n\nIt's easy,(for a video conversion application) ... and it does the conversion really well from almost any format to almost any other.\nScreenshots from winff:\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between /etc/init/ and /etc/init.d/? What is the difference between /etc/init/ and /etc/init.d/? \nMore generally, what meaning does the .d suffix convey to a directory?\n\nA: The \".d\" is usually appended to a directory name to indicate that what used to be (or what could have been) handled by a single script or a single configuration file has been split into multiple files for the sake of convenience, but which should be included, or executed, together.\nFor example, /etc/apache/conf.d/ or /etc/apt/sources.d/\nIn cases where it's important which order they should be included/executed, the files in these directories sometimes start with a number, like \"00-default\" or \"80-user\" so that they execute in the right order.\nIn the case of /etc/init.d/ it sort of indicates that the scripts in \"init.d\" should all be executed.  Nowadays, however, the init system of modern operating systems is a bit more involved than that, but the directory name is still there.\n\nA: /etc/init.d contains scripts used by the System V init tools (SysVinit). This is the traditional service management package for Linux, containing the init program (the first process that is run when the kernel has finished initializing¹) as well as some infrastructure to start and stop services and configure them. Specifically, files in /etc/init.d are shell scripts that respond to start, stop, restart, and (when supported) reload commands to manage a particular service. These scripts can be invoked directly or (most commonly) via some other trigger (typically the presence of a symbolic link in /etc/rc?.d/).\n/etc/init contains configuration files used by Upstart. Upstart is a young service management package championed by Ubuntu. Files in /etc/init are configuration files telling Upstart how and when to start, stop, reload the configuration, or query the status of a service. As of lucid, Ubuntu is transitioning from SysVinit to Upstart, which explains why many services come with SysVinit scripts even though Upstart configuration files are preferred. In fact, the SysVinit scripts are processed by a compatibility layer in Upstart.\n.d in directory names typically indicates a directory containing many configuration files or scripts for a particular situation (e.g. /etc/apt/sources.list.d contains files that are concatenated to make a virtual sources.list; /etc/network/if-up.d contains scripts that are executed when a network interface is activated). This structure is usually used when each entry in the directory is provided by a different source, so that each package can deposit its own plug-in without having to parse a single configuration file to reference itself. In this case, it just happens that “init” is a logical name for the directory, SysVinit came first and used init.d, and Upstart used plain init for a directory with a similar purpose (it would have been more “mainstream”, and perhaps less arrogant, if they'd used /etc/upstart.d instead).\n¹ not counting initrd\n\nA: As you point out, the \".d\" nomenclature is puzzling and strange, and doesn't really have any place in any modern system -- you'll notice that most modern services have tended to drop it.\nThe reason the directory is /etc/init and not /etc/upstart is because Upstart is the project name, the actual installed binary is still /sbin/init thus it would not make sense for its configuration to have a name that didn't match the binary.\n", "Q: Anybody know what happened to gmplayer in Maverick? My long-term media player (for various reasons) has been gmplayer. A simple floating UI that remembered its fullscreen layout and just worked for me. I'm not trying to convert anybody but please respect that I'm not looking for alternatives.\nIt used to live in a package called mplayer-gui. Since upgrading to Maverick, I can't find it anywhere.\nApparently an Ubuntu-sent changelog says I should use SMplayer instead but as anybody who has used both will tell you immediately, they're completely different styles of media player.\nI'm not against progress but I can't see anything but regression here.\n\nA: Copied from Bug 649240:\n\nmplayer-gui has been removed in\n  maverick because it is broken\n  upstream.

I have problems transferring binary programs to a micro-controller prototype board when using ubuntu/kubuntu to mount the board via usb. With MacOS and Windows there are no problems. I have found the writing from Ubuntu definitely changes the written file. I suspect that the write caching is the problem. How can I disable it, or what else might be the problem.\n\nA: Read this first: http://groups.google.com/group/linux.kernel/msg/8d1591196c0ae15e?pli=1\nI am unsure if it is true or not.\nYou can try using hdparm to set the write caching feature to off at runtime. (You will probably need to run this after every boot or every time you remove and reinsert the device)\nsudo hdparm -W 0 /dev/devicename\nPlease ensure you know the correct device name (sdb, sdc or so on).\nYou can find out the device name by running:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou can also edit /etc/fstab and add the mount options sync,dirsync however I am not very familiar with how /etc/fstab works with removable devices. I think they need a permanent mount point.\n\nA: kudos to @NightwishFan for the hdparm switch to set the drive's write-caching feature.\nNote that the sync mount option decreases the speed by a magnitude (over 10 times). flush mount option ensures an effective writing with no performance cost. Also I've been using it with no issues for a few years on all the FAT devices (spinning or flash-memory based) I've used: Actually the whole set of mount options is noauto,users,noatime,flush,umask=111,dmask=000, set manually or in /etc/fstab.\n\nA: I have replaced \"sync\" in favor of \"noatime,flush\" like stated in @tuk0z answer.\nThis lead to the USB floppydrive behaving the same like sync, but it writes files so much faster, like the normal operationspeed you expect it to be.\nReading image files from floppy does not result in random artifacts anymore. Also reading DD floppies does not result in weird characters in filenames.\nPerhaps it's a bit unfortunate how the official documentation of \"mount\"\nput the usage in context.\nKudos!\n", "Q: Graphics card problems after update During the week I did a update through the update manager and since then my desktop graphics have stopped working properly.\nI usually just quickly glance through the list of packages to be updated before pressing install and this time I notice that a component called fglrx was going to be updated. I can only speculate that this has anything to do with it. I chose to update...\nAfter the update I did a reboot and that's when the trouble began. My system was unable to boot into high resolution mode and gave me the option to boot into low graphics mode or reconfigure. I tried the reconfigure option but it didn't do anything and after I fiddled around a bit I was able to get back to a low-res desktop.\nThe first thing I tried was sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but this seem to do nothing. It just dropped me back to the command-line without a message.\nThen I checked if my hardware drivers where still enabled so I opened System / Administration / Hardware Drivers panel and after searching for available drivers it came up with an empty list. I decided to downloaded the latest ATI x86_64 drivers and did an install of those. Installation was successful and I did a reboot.\nI'm currently in high-res mode but I don't seem to have any hardware acceleration. Dragging a window around the desktop is a painful process to watch. There is an aticonfig command line utility that outputs about 50 zillion options. I'm pretty sure there used to be a graphical UI version of it but I can't seem to find it anywhere in my Applications menu.\nWhen I issue the following command: fglrxinfo I get the following output:\nX Error of failed request:  BadRequest (invalid request code or no such operation)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  136 (GLX)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  19 (X_GLXQueryServerString)\n  Serial number of failed request:  15\n  Current serial number in output stream:  15\n\nI'm on Ubuntu 9.10 and I have an ATI Radeon 5450 video card.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: First do a sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.legacy, then check to make sure there is no file in /etc/X11 with the name xorg.conf, then restart X or reboot the machine. If X does not find an existing xorg.conf it will attempt to generate one, and sometimes changes in the system or a change to the video driver will cause problems with the existing xorg.conf file. Also, this is an easy thing to try and easily reverted if it does not help.\nLooking around on Google, it looks like the Radeon 5450 is a somewhat old card. Cards that are more than three years old or so often get rotated out of fglrx support. Sometimes the cards become unsupported by fglrx and picked up by the \"radeon\" open-source driver. Sometimes there is a lag in between these things happening and you are out in the cold.\nBy \"uninstall the upstream one\" is meant to get rid of the driver you downloaded from ATI. ATI's drivers are notoriously unreliable. I see that the driver is provided in the form of a .run file. I don't see any uninstall instructions for it. You might have to parse the scripts contained in the file and go manually delete all the things it installed. I would open the file and look in it myself, but my net connection is too skinny for me to grab that 100MB file in a timely manner.\nI strongly recommend that you try to use the \"radeon\" driver instead of fglrx. If it works and provides the features and performance you need, stick with it. Also, please read the pages linked by NightwishFan if you have not done so already. \n", "Q: Is it possible to hide the \"Copy To\" and \"Move To\" context menus? I've just read this question and realized that I had never used either the \"Copy To\" or \"Move To\" context menu - is it possible to hide them?\n\n\nA: It is unfortunately not possible to do this in either 12.04 or 12.10, because of the changes to Nautilus and the removal of /usr/share/nautilus/ui/nautilus-directory-view-ui.xml. It has been asked very recently (June 2012) in the gnome nautilus mailing lists, and it is clear from the developers' responses that one would now have to download the source code, patch it, and then recompile it to eliminate or hide the copy to and move to menus.\nEmmanuel Bassi, a gnome developer, responded to the same request on the mailing list by noting that:  \n\nThe UI definitions are part of the application:\n  modifying them is the equivalent of modifying the binary on disk.\n\nIn another response, Emmanuel goes into more detail and points out that:\n\nIt's not possible because now (in the interest of relocatability\n  of the application, and to improve the startup time) the UI\n  description file is \"compiled\" inside the binary itself; the UI\n  description file is only available in the Git repository, and every\n  change requires recompiling Nautilus.\nGiven that editing the UI file once installed was never a supported\n  action for the reasons I pointed out in this thread, this is not a\n  break in functionality.\nWhat you want to achieve cannot be done with the current, or any\n  future, version of Nautilus; the only way to do it is to actually\n  modify Nautilus so that it can do what you want.\n\nThis is the official position on Nautilus, and so the only thing to do is to suggest a patch, or simply prepare your own patch and build your own custom version. The source code that you need is available from the git repository.\nThere is no dirty 'hack' that can accomplish what you want at the moment, as the developers have explained. It may change in the future, but this is the current state of affairs.\n\nA: For 11.10 and earlier\nYes, edit the file:\n/usr/share/nautilus/ui/nautilus-directory-view-ui.xml\n\nand find the last instance of this:\n    <menu action=\"CopyToMenu\">\n        <menuitem name=\"Copy to next pane\" action=\"Copy to next pane\"/>\n        <menuitem name=\"Copy to Home\" action=\"Copy to Home\"/>\n        <menuitem name=\"Copy to Desktop\" action=\"Copy to Desktop\"/>\n    </menu>\n    <menu action=\"MoveToMenu\">\n        <menuitem name=\"Move to next pane\" action=\"Move to next pane\"/>\n        <menuitem name=\"Copy to Home\" action=\"Move to Home\"/>\n        <menuitem name=\"Copy to Desktop\" action=\"Move to Desktop\"/>\n    </menu>\n\nand make the insides empty like this:\n    <menu action=\"CopyToMenu\">\n    </menu>\n    <menu action=\"MoveToMenu\">\n    </menu>\n\nThat should solve your problem.\n", "Q: How to change the order of the OK/Cancel buttons?

How can I change it? What should I do to change it and set sequence to OK / Cancel in all dialogs?\n\nA: You can't change that (without changing the program).

Try installing the lpr package from the repositories and then installing the deb and see if that works.\nGuess 2: It sounds like you're trying to install a deb from a website for a brother 7340 printer: This page might be a good starting point if you want to split it off into another question.\n\nA: Actually, I ran into the same problem. Turns out I followed some irrelevant information and created a /etc/init.d/lpd file as a softlink to /etc/init.d/cups\nThe .postrm script checks for lpd and if it exists, tries to start the service.\nAfter I deleted the softlinked lpd file in the init.d directory, the package installation and removal went back to normal.\n\nA: The problem here appears to be that the package has managed to get itself half-installed, but now its maintainer scripts are all faililng (due to being unable to start the lpd service).\nYou should be able to resolve this by editing the /var/lib/dpkg/info/brmfc7340lpr.postrm file and commenting out (by adding # to the start of the line) the line which is trying to start lpd (or just comment out everything).  You should then be able to run dpkg --configure -a to get the package properly installed before you can remove it.\nYou might need to edit more of the packages maintainer scripts in order to remove the package - they'll all be in /var/lib/dpkg/info/, and they'll be named something like brmfc7340lpr.X where X can be one of preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm.\nThis is an example of the sort of havoc a poorly written package can wreak.\n\nA: You can always (re)install a package using dpkg:\ndpkg --install local-file.deb\n\nIn order to make a \"clean room\" installation, you can first purge the package and then install it again:\ndpkg --purge brmfc7340lpr\ndpkg --install brmfc7340lpr*.deb\n\nYou might need to add option --force-depends during purge, if some other package depends on brmfc7340lpr.\nUpdate: Based on the transcript you posted, it seems that the\n brmfc7340lpr package cannot be (re)installed because its\n post-removal script is erroring out.\nThose files are stored in directory /var/lib/dpkg/info; for each\npackage X, there can be any one of these scripts:\n\n\n*\n\n*X.postinst run after the package has been installed, e.g., to\nstart services provided by the package.\n\n*X.prerm run before removing/purging the package, e.g., to\nensure that daemons provided by the package are stopped.\n\n*X.postrm run after the package has been removed, e.g., to\nsignal any service optionally using the package that it is no\nlonger available.  (For instance, a printer driver package might\nwant to signal cpus/lpr to remove printers depending on that\nspecific driver.)\nNow, this brmfc7340lpr package seems to try to (re)start the lpd\nprinter daemon upon removal, which won't work as Ubuntu uses CUPS\ninstead: you should definitely look for a CUPS-compatible printer\ndriver -- see the link in Jorge Castro's answer. (I think this is a\nbug in the package, as it should not restart the lpd service\nunconditionally, but just reload it if it's already running.)\nThe best option to go forward comes from this launchpad\nanswer:\nln -s /etc/init.d/cpus /etc/init.d/lpd\n\nThis will effectively (re)start CUPS when the lpd service is instead\nsearched for.\nOtherwise, I only see two options, both rather unpleasant:\n\n\n*\n\n*Either edit the /var/lib/dpkg/info/brmfc7340lpr.postrm script,\nand comment out the line that is invoking /etc/init.d/lpd start\n(or restart or stop), (e.g., just replace it with /bin/true).\nAnother option is to just place exit 0 as the first non-comment\nline in the script. This would be my favorite, but requires a bit\nof confidence with editing shell scripts.\n\n*Install lpr, purge the brmfc6340lpr package, purge lpr: this\nrequires a bit of attention as lpr conflicts with the default\nUbuntu printer spooling system CUPS:\na. sudo aptitude install lpr (this will remove cups-bsd and\n  ubuntu-desktop as a side effect)\nb. sudo aptitude purge brmfc7340lpr lpr (should work now)\nc. sudo aptitude install cups-bsd ubuntu-desktop (restore system\n  to its original state)\n", "Q: How can I disable the purple splash screen at boot?

But if I try to run it now, I can't run it as it hasn't the execution permission. The bad part is that I can't change the permissions too. I'm chmod-ding +x but no change at all with its permissions.\nSo this seems to be a bug? Any help? \nThough when I put it on ext4 partition, I can set the permission. But I want to do this as I did before, right from its default NTFS location.\n\nA: NTFS doesn't support the execute permission because it's designed for Windows, which doesn't have the same concept of \"executable\" files as Linux does. If you're trying to run Windows .exe files in Wine, it should still work if you run wine explicitly, like this:\nwine /path/to/executable.exe\n\nIf you do need to execute files directly, you can set the permissions that will be applied to all files with the fmask option in /etc/fstab. You may also need to add the exec option if that's not the default for NTFS (I don't have a drive handy to check right now). The value for fmask tells the driver which bits to turn off, so, for example, to allow read, write, and execute for all users, you should have something like this:\n/dev/hda1  /mnt/windows  ntfs-3g  defaults,exec,fmask=000  0  0\n\nIf there's already an fmask option, the simplest way to turn on the execute bit is to subtract 1 from any digit that's odd.\nIf you don't know how permission masking works, the basic idea is that the read, write, and execute permissions are represented by the values 4, 2, and 1 respectively. You can add them together to combine permissions so, for example, reading + writing would be 6. The permission mask is a combination of three digits that apply to the owner, group, and \"others\" (everyone else).\nJust remember that fmask (also, umask and dmask) in fstab are the permissions you want to turn off.\nAs a slightly more interesting example, this would set the permissions to \"rwx\" for the owner, \"rx\" for the group, and \"r\" for everyone else:\n/dev/hda1  /mnt/windows  ntfs-3g  defaults,exec,fmask=023  0  0\n\n\nA: I use a line such as the following in my /etc/fstab file:\n/dev/sda5    /media/disk    ntfs,   user,noauto,exec    0 2\n\nwhich prevents the partition from being mounted at startup, but allows me to mount as root with:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5\n\nor\nsudo mount /media/disk \n\nfrom the command line.  \nMounting from \"Places\" gives an error, so this solution is not perfect,  but I'm willing to live with it.  Hope this is useful for others.\n\nA: It looks like a bug in older versions...\nTry upgrading to Wine 1.3\nThis worked for me, and now I can install anything directly from a NTFS partition.\n", "Q: No volume in kubuntu 10.04 I am having both gnome and kde on my system.

I have a Zebra TLP thermal printer (LPT-attached) and a proprietary business web application using  an ActiveX element to print on it. Is there a way to make it work on Linux?\nIf there was, then I could probably extinguish Windows in my company!\n\nA: For the web application, your best bet is to try running Internet Explorer in Wine using the method here: http://yokozar.org/blog/archives/236\nWine prints using ordinary Linux printing system (cups), so you'll need to get the printer working \"normally\" as well.  However if I'm reading your post right it seems like the printer requires a special Windows driver.  If the printer doesn't just work, you may be in for some difficulty, however all may not be lost.\nhttp://wiki.winehq.org/Printing  mentions a project to get Windows Printer drivers to work via Wine; this morphed into the ddiwrapper project.  ddiwrapper has the potential to make Windows XP printer drivers work in Ubuntu, however it is not packaged for Ubuntu at this point and I am unsure of the project's current state (it started as a Novell thing some years ago).\n", "Q: Why is 'libgnomevfs' files under /usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0? Most applications, including the gnomevfs headers themselves, expect the files to be under /usr/include/libgnomevfs, but Ubuntu has them under /usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0/libgnomevfs.\nWhy? The package I'm referring to is called libgnomevfs2.\nInside /usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0/libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs.h` we find:\n#include <libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-acl.h>\n#include <libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-address.h>\n#include <libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-async-ops.h>\n#include <libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-cancellation.h>\n...\n\nMeaning that even the headers themselves expect the files to be in that location - and nothing that includes this file will work.\nAm I missing something, or is this a glitch?\n\nA: The package is installed in /usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0 so that it can coexist with other versions of gnome-vfs (e.g. imagine also having /usr/include/gnome-vfs-1.0 available). When a package needs to build against a version of gnome-vfs, it should query pkg-config to find the installation location. (This is normally done during configure for the to-be-compiled software.) For example:\npkg-config --cflags gnome-vfs-2.0\n-pthread -DORBIT2=1 -I/usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0 -I/usr/lib/gnome-vfs-2.0/include -I/usr/include/gconf/2 -I/usr/include/orbit-2.0 -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/glib-2.0/include  \n\nNote the use of all the -I flags, including -I/usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0. The output of the pkg-config --cflags call would normally be added to the CFLAGS environment variable of the build. Given the -I part, the compiler will be able to find the full path to the headers, since it will start looking in /usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0 and then tack on the header path libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-acl.h, which will resolve the correct full file path: /usr/include/gnome-vfs-2.0/libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-acl.h.\nSo, if the software does not already use pkg-config, you can try to pass the variables (cflags and libs) into the configure call:\nCFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags gnome-vfs-2.0` LDFLAGS=`pkg-config --libs gnome-vfs-2.0` ./configure\n\n\nA: Applications should not expect the headers and libs to be in a fixed directory but use pkg-config to get the needed parameters, e.g.: pkg-config --cflags gnome-vfs-2.0\n", "Q: Add volume control to desktop panel indicator? I recently upgrade to Ubuntu 10.04 and I noticed that I'm no longer able to add a volume control to my desktop panels. When I right click the panel and choose \"Add to panel\" there is no longer a volume control in the list.\nHow do I add a volume control to my desktop panel?\n\nA: You want the the option from the list to add an \"Indicator Applet\".\nThis is because from Ubuntu 10.04 there has been a push for panel items to use a new system for panel items.\nIf adding the \"Indicator Applet\" appears to make no difference, you should try to install the package indicator-sound which contains the sound indicator.\n\nA: If you want the volume control like in previous version (9.10 and earlier) of Ubuntu you'll need to edit a file.\nOpen the terminal and type:\ngksu gedit /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-volume-control-applet.desktop\n\nIn the file that opens, look for this line:\nOnlyShowIn=XFCE;\n\nThat line prevents the older volume control from showing on the panel. Change it by putting a # in front of it so it looks like:\n#OnlyShowIn=XFCE;\n\nSave the file then log out and back in and the volume control should be back.\nIf you find that you have 2 volume controls and you want to keep the older control, remove the app called \"indicator-sound\" via synaptic.\n", "Q: Can I set up 2 monitors to be 2 separate Gnome virtual desktops instead of one big? If I plug an external CRT to my laptop, it normally either displays the same picture as the laptop's panel, or extends the desktop area.

And I switch (which, AFAIK, can be an inconvenience with Xinerama) monitor configurations (detach all monitors but a laptop's built-in panel, attach monitors with different resolutions) pretty often (sometimes many times a day).\n\nA: What kind of videocard are you using? With an nVidia card I would recommend using twinview. Otherwise it should be possible to simply enable xinerama for it to work.\n", "Q: Can I set up Nautilus to use a Midnight Commander-like hot keys scheme for 2-panel mode? I have been using \"commanders\" with DOS and Windows for more than 15 years. Needless to say it'd significantly improve my comfort if I could be able to create directories by pressing F7, deleting by F8, copying (to an opposite panel) by F5 and moving by F6. I was very pleased by Nautilus to introduce  a 2-panel view, but disappointed by lack of traditional \"commander\" F-keys scheme. Can I correct this without editing and recompiling Nautilus sources?\n\nA: Answering a different question, I was reminded of an option that has now been deeply hidden by default, \"Editable Menu Accelerators.\" This can let you do nearly what you want.\nTo enable this option, launch gconf-editor from the terminal or the \"Run Application\" dialog (Alt-F2).\nNavigate to desktop>gnome>interface and check can_change_accels\nOr just run this line in a terminal:\ngconftool --set /desktop/gnome/interface/can_change_accels --type=bool True\n\nNow, to change an application shortcut key, open the menu, and with the mouse pointer on the menu item you wish to change, press the new combination of keys. To remove a shortcut key, press Backspace or Delete.\nSo you can get new directories with F7 and deleting by F8, but I still don't think that you can get the nifty cross pane coping ect in Nautilus.\nSo while what you're after might not be completely possible with Nautilus, it's also worth mentioning that you can still use a \"commander\" in Ubuntu.\nCheck out Midnight Commander if console applications are your style. \nsudo apt-get install mc\n\nIf you're looking for something that integrates into the desktop, try GNOME Commander. It's a two-pane graphical file manager in the \"commander\" style, with your familiar hot keys.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-commander\n\n\nA: andrewsomething is on the right track. Using the method he describes, you can assign keyboard shortcuts to Edit -> Copy to/Move to -> Other pane. So you'll find that assigning F5 to copying to the other pane is no problem. Assigning F6 is not really recommendable, as this already has a different meaning in GTK+.\n\nA: Yet another way to define arbitrary hot keys is by using the Nautilus extension API although it is not quite designed for that. As a proof of concept I've developed this extension which defines the following hot keys:\n\n\n*\n\n*F5 to copy selected files/directories to another panel\n\n*F6 to move selected files/directories to another panel\n\n*F7 to create a directory in the active panel\n\n*F8 to delete selected files/directories\n\n*Ctrl+O to open terminal in the current directory of the active panel (only works for local filesystem)\n\n\nYou can even configure the shortcuts manually in the Keyboad Shortcuts window provided by this extension:\n\nUnlike the can-change-accels solution, this one works fine with global menus.\n\nA: The best gui \"commander\" style application I've used in Ubuntu (or any other distro) is krusader.  Yes, I am a exclusive Gnome user and krusader is a KDE app, but it is worth it.  The first command I run upon installing Ubuntu is: \n\"sudo apt-get install mc krusader\"\nKrusader is almost as good as Servant Salamander on windows -- one of the two \"shareware\" programs I actually purchased in the 30+ years of using computers (I have to use windows at work).\n", "Q: Can I configure Nautilus to step into archives instead of opening them in external File Roller application window? Midnight Commander (as well as all Norton and Total Commanders I used to use with DOS and Windows) provide a very pleasant facility of stepping into archives (tar.gz, zip, 7z, rar, etc.) and other containers (as ISO CD images) and working with them much like plane directories. Can Nautilus be configured to behave so?\n\nA: Not in the way mc is doing it, but you can open them with Archive Mounter and then access them like a mounted file system.\n", "Q: Why to use ordinary kernel if there's realtime one? What are benefits of an ordinary Ubuntu kernel compared to realtime one? What are realtime kernel's tradeoffs?\n\nA: Expanding on this answer, there's a general trade-off between throughput and latency (or responsiveness).  Throughput is how much work you can do per unit time; latency is how long you wait before you can start new work.\nSince there's overhead in switching from one task to another (you need to re-load the old task's state, flush caches, etc), throughput is maximised by switching task as infrequently as possible.  On the other hand, latency is minimised by switching rapidly between tasks, so no individual task needs to wait a long time before it can run again.  As such, the improved latency in the realtime kernel will come at the cost of decreased peak throughput.\nOutside the throughput/latency trade-off there are others to consider; the realtime kernel isn't mainline (yet), so doesn't have as much testing, and the realtime kernel will consume more power (because it wakes the processor more aggressively).\n\nA: Realtime kernels can guarantee a certain response time to a process. For example the process has to read each 10ms the values from an control system. In realtime you can assure that no value is dropped.\nIf you  don't operate some kind of manufactoring control system, you simple don't need it.\nThe overall system performance may be better if the kernel has not to guarantee every process a time slice in a period. (Better I/O utilization, lower process switch overhead etc etc)\nTo sum up: Realtime does not increase the throughput of a system.\n\nA: The main issue with running a real-time kernel is that it poses a serious security issue. RT processes have the potential to completely take over a machine.\nThere are also other reasons not to run RT, among them:\n\n*\n\n*Since Linux 2.6, the real-time stack has been part of the Linux kernel, having a kernel patched with a real-time stack is no longer necessary.\n\n\n*Preempt-RT is enabled in the default Ubuntu kernel configuration to achieve the lowest possible latency for audio and other applications, while keeping the user interface usable.\n\n\n*It may slow down your machine.\nFurther information and exploration of the issues here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/RealTimeKernel\nhttps://sevencapitalsins.wordpress.com/2007/08/10/low-latency-kernel-wtf\n", "Q: ATI drivers: delay when unminimizing I installed the proprietary ATI/AMD FGLRX graphics driver through \"jockey-gtk\" to get rid of my computer's over heating problems.

In XFCE it was very convenient to pop-up applications launcher menu and running applications list menu anywhere on desktop by right and middle click respectively. Can be Gnome configured to behave so?\nI never put any files/folders on desktop, so I don't need desktop context menu functionality. I also have a very big second monitor and am pretty disturbed by moving mouse over it to the first screen to use taskbar (and placing taskbar on that second big screen wont help much, as it is still big).\n\nA: If you remove the menu from the panel and hit Alt + F1 the menu will appear at the mouse cursor.  If you use Compiz you can then use the commands plugin along with xte to simulate keyboard presses and make Alt + F1 be any mouse/corner press you want.\nxte is part of the xautomation package:  sudo apt-get install xautomation\nThis is a helpful tutorial on the Ubuntu Forums.\nThere is also MyGTKmenu, which allows you to easily create your own custom menu.\nThen there's apwal, which allows you to create a custom application-launcher-thing (something like an \"application wall\", get it?) which can be assigned to open with mouse buttons.  It's available in the repos.\nThen don't forget about GNOME Do and Kupfer, which in my opinion are far superior to any menu.\nOh, and don't forget about the mouse gesture program Easystroke, which allows you to run any keyboard command, script etc., with simple mouse movements rather than having to click your desktop at all.

It is possible to use other software, such as compiz, to manage the wallpaper but I think this removes other desktop functionality (eg. files/folders/shortcuts on the desktop).\n", "Q: Can I accelerate mouse sensetivity over the standard maximum? I've used \"Mouse Preferences\" window to set mouse pointer acceleration and sensitivity sliders to their maximums, but I am still not satisfied with how fast does mouse pointer move (I've got a very big display).

I'm a Ubuntu 10.04 user who is looking for a way to, for example, make my computer type a + character when I hold down the Windows Key (I think it's called Super in Linux world) and press the K key. I need this to work in all applications. (I'm a person with a typing disability, and I need to adapt Ubuntu to my needs.) Thanks!\n\nA: Since you want to remap the keys for all applications the best option is to use xmodmap. It is flexible and very powerful but involves typing in a few commands into a terminal.\nStep 0 - The approach\nThe X-server manages the keyboard and all key events and translates that into keycodes for all applications.\nThe approach would be to map a modifier key (like Super or Right Alt key) as the \"mode switch\" key and tell the X-server to generate different codes depending on whether a key is pressed with Mode key being held down or not.\nBy default there is no mode switch key defined and also all keys are configured to generate the same code when they are pressed with or without mode switch. This is good since this means except for the keys you override explicitly no other keys will behave differently or need additional configuration.\nHowever, I would like you to consider using Right Alt key as mode switch especially if you are also using compiz since some compiz plugins map super key shortcuts (e.g., window picker, shift switcher etc). If you are not keen on controlling compiz via the keyboard then Super is just fine.\nTo xmodmap, the super keys are identified as Super_L or Super_R. You need to pick one to use as the mode switch key. Alternatively, the right alt key is Alt_R. You can confirm these by running xev and pressing the necessary keys on your keyboard. See this post for the steps.\nStep 1 - Setting up the modifier map\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (Applications -> Accesories -> Terminal) and run the following command to create a file with current keybindings. We will use this as starting point.\nxmodmap -pke > curkeys.map\nxmodmap -pm >> curkeys.map\n\n\n*Open this in your favourite text editor. gedit curkeys.map & opens it in gedit. Towards the end of the file, you will see some lines like this:\nkeycode 253 =\nkeycode 254 =\nkeycode 255 =\nxmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):\n\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock        Caps_Lock (0x42)\ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)\nmod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)\nmod3      \nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\nmod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)\n\n\n*Delete the line starting with \"xmodmap: up to 4...\"\n\n*Edit the modifier map so it looks like this. Put the word \"add \" at the beginning of each line and insert \"= \" after the modifier name. Then remove the codes in parentheses and commas. Also note that I have moved Mode_switch from the mod5 line to mod3 line since it was empty. The modified table should look like this - actual contents will slightly vary in your case from those below (depends on your keyboard layout).\nadd shift =      Shift_L  Shift_R\nadd lock  =      Caps_Lock\nadd control =    Control_L  Control_R\nadd mod1    =    Alt_L Meta_L Alt_R \nadd mod2    =    Num_Lock\nadd mod3    =    Mode_switch\nadd mod4    =    Super_L Super_R Super_L Hyper_L \nadd mod5    =    ISO_Level3_Shift\n\n\n*Remap physical mode-switch key. Add a line like this at the end (Replace Super_L with Super_R or Alt_R if required). \nkeysym Super_L = Mode_switch\n\n\n*Remove the keyname (Super_L) from any modifier definition. For Super_L this means removing it from the mod4 line.\nadd mod4    =    Super_R Hyper_L \n\nNow the right \"Super\" key will still act as a normal super key whereas the left key will have special properties.\n\n*Now we need to remap the keys to produce different codes whether they are pressed while holding down Super_L or not.\nEach line in our file beginning with keycode specifies 4 keysyms for each key to be generated based on whether Mod1 (shift keys) and Mode switch keys are pressed.(link)\n!...........................................................................\n!        Key            Base              Shift           Mode    Mode+Shift\n!---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nkeycode  13             = 4               dollar          4       quotedbl\nkeycode  14             = 5               percent         5       colon\nkeycode  15             = 6               asciicircum     6       comma\nkeycode  16             = 7               ampersand       7       period\n...\nkeycode  45             = k               K               k       K\n\nIf we want Super_L+k keypress to generate a \"+\" key then we need to modify it to read so \nkeycode  45 = k K plus plus\n\nThe final plus also maps Shift+Super_L+k to plus, but this can be mapped to something else. For each key there is exactly 1 line to modify. Edit more lines to remap more keys - leave the first 2 entries intact to retain normal keypress behaviour.\n\n*Save the file and exit the editor.\n\n*Install the keymap by running the following commands in a terminal. The first one sets it up for this session, the second makes it permanent for future sessions.\nxmodmap curkeys.map\ncp curkeys.map ~/.Xmodmap\n\n\n*You can immediately test this by pressing the modified keys (Super_L + k for example).\nStep 3 - Adding / revising the map\nOnce the modified map is installed it is easy to add new keys. \n\n\n*\n\n*Use xev to find the keycodes and keysyms \n\n*test it by running this command to map the key :\nxmodmap -e \"keycode <code> = <base> <shift> <new-mapping> <new-shift-mapping>\"\n\nReplace items in angle brackets (like <code> <base> etc) with appropriate values.\n\n*Backup the curkeys.map file.\n\n*Open the curkeys.map and edit the line for the corresponding keycode.\n\n*Reapply with the below commands (first one is not necessary if you did step 2)\nxmodmap curkeys.map\ncp curkeys.map ~/.Xmodmap\n\nNote:1: Modifications made in Keyboard Shortcuts (via e.g., System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts) affect the modifier map and will be generally lost on next login. So please avoid that.\nNote:2: I sometimes get error messages like this while using this method. I don't know what this means, however, these are generally harmless.\nX Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)\nMajor opcode of failed request:  118 (X_SetModifierMapping)\nValue in failed request:  0x17\nSerial number of failed request:  263\nCurrent serial number in output stream:  263\n\nDetailed help for xmodmap is available here.\n", "Q: How do I use the new \"Ubuntu Font Family\" in older releases?

Choose multipage where it says viewer (or hit CTRL-M), and it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out from there.\n\nA: The idea of having a simple scan utility was behind the development of, well,  Simple Scan - the scanning tool installed by default from 10.04 on (Applications ‣ Graphics ‣ Simple Scan). \n\nSimply scan as many pages as you want and choose PDF as file format when saving. \nAnother slightly less simple program that offers additional features like text recognition is gscan2pdf, also in the repositories.\n\n\nA: I was using xsane until I saw this question and considered its interface idiosyncratic to say the least, but effective.\nUpon seeing this question I went looking and found gscan2pdf living in the Ubuntu Lucid/Maverick repositories. It uses the same scanning (libsane) engine but the UI is far more Gnome-ish.

I consider this an UI bug.\nThis feature is documented on Help > Contents:\n\nFrom the \"Save As\" dialog box, choose one of the supported file types, or simply change the extension in the \"Name\" field.\n\nIt says that the following formats are supported:\n\n\n*\n\n*PDF\n\n*JPEG\n\n*PNG\n\n*TIFF\n\n\nInteresting fact: if you change the scan type (dropdown besides \"Scan\") to \"Text\", the default file type becomes PDF.\n\nA: Scan pages from USB scanner.

It is very powerful, and intuitive once you read the setup guide linked from Help > XSane Doc in the program - to know how much you can do with it.  It's also worth checking your SANE backend is working properly (not too Arch specific): https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SANE\nIf you want to automatically scan documents from a feeder, and wonder if XSane will know when to stop (and not stop too early), simply input a number at the top left (number of scans icon) larger than the number of pages that fit in your feeder.  I.e. if your feeder can take 10 pages, then enter 15 (to account for thickness variation).  If you have a duplex scanner, double this number.\nWhen the feeder runs out, you will get a dialog box with a green warning triangle saying \"\"Scanned pages: 0\".  This just means that the feeder is empty and you can close the dialog.  If you selected \"viewer\" or \"save\" at the top right of XSane, then the files will all be there - remember to save them from the viewer.  Now you can press scan again to carry on where you left off, with the numbers incrementing from the same point or you can start a new project.  There will not be any blank pages added.  If you selected \"Multipage\" the project dialog should show all the completed scans and you can click to save as a multipage PDF or TIFF or PostScript.\nHTH,\nDC\n", "Q: Grub boots into recovery mode When I boot grub doesnt show up (only ubuntu installed) I would like grub to be shown for a second or 2 (shift doesnt seem to bring it up).

I found a problem with an application on Ubuntu. \nQuestions :\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I best report the issue? \n\n*What sort of information should I provide? \n\n\nA: The most current guide appears to be ReportingBugs - Community Ubuntu Documentation\nIt looks pretty up to date to me, and I think it would be redundant to put that information on here.\n\nA: If you're having a X error (graphical subsystem), the X Debugging page is very useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*X/Debugging - Ubuntu Wiki\nUsually doing an ubuntu-bug xorg will get all the right information to Launchpad. Bryce adds:\n\nYes, definitely a good recommendation. But also make sure to actually describe the problem. The most common mistake made in filing X bug reports is not fully describing what actually happened. Don't assume the logs alone tell the full story - be verbose.\n\n\nA: The Ubuntu Wiki has a very thorough guide that is well illustrated and covers many possible scenarios.\nThe essence of that page is that you first need a Launchpad account, then press Alt+F2 and enter ubuntu-bug packagename.  In 11.04 and later you can enter ubuntu-bug -w and click on the affected window. \nThere are also methods described on that wiki page telling you how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*file bugs against running programs\n\n*against no particular package (and how to decide which package) \n\n*and from computers with no internet access.\n\n\nThere is a quick tutorial video that explains better.\nAnd some more information on this site about how to gather information for a bug report:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've got Internal Error whilst running a Ubuntu Beta. How to gather information and find out what it is?\n\nA: If you know the application in question (specifically the package name), I would recommend using the ubuntu-bug command from a terminal.  ubuntu-bug packagename will gather some automated information and take you right to the launchpad report a bug page, where you can describe the problem.\nIt's also a good time to search for potential duplicates, and if you find one click the \"affects me too\" button.\nThis help page has a lot more useful info: ReportingBugs - Community Ubuntu Documentation \n\nA: It's as easy as visiting Launchpad and filling the 2 or 3 fields that are there. Command line is not the only way.\nAlternatively, you can use this (replace PACKAGENAME in the URL with the package name. For example: unity, gnome-shell, etc):\nhttp://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/PACKAGENAME/+filebug?no-redirect\n\nIt's mentioned in the Ubuntu documentation.\n\nA: To report bugs to Debian use reportbug.

This answer essentially, consolidates that page, and hence it is advised that you read it, and if you are hunting bugs, it is required that you read it.\n\nShort version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Know the package at fault? go type ubuntu-bug <packagename> in a terminal.\n\n*Have a window before you thats buggy? go type ubuntu-bug -w in a terminal, and click on the window.\n\n*Have the pid? go type ubuntu-bug <pid> in a terminal.\nYou may also use Run dialog (Alt+F2) instead of terminal.\n\n\nLong version:\nStep one: Preliminaries\n\n*\n\n*Create an account at Launchpad, if you don't already have one.\nIt is advised that you read Launchpad Help on creating a new account.\nDirect Login/signup link here\n\n*Determine if it is really a bug.\n\n*Make sure the bug hasn't been already reported by searching Existing Bugs.\n\nThis is important to not trouble the volunteer Bug Squad, who help in resolving bugs. If you found an existing bug, you can answer 'Does this bug affect you' with 'This bug affects me' and add any additional information as comments.\n  \nStep two: Determine the package at fault\n\nIf you know which package is at fault, you can run ubuntu-bug <packagename> to initiate the bug reporting process. you may now proceed to the next step.\nDetailed instructions on finding the right package are given here\nAnd if those detailed instructions didn't help, you have a last resort.\nAs a last Resort:\nYou can type ubuntu-bug in a terminal, or Run  window, and answer few questions to gather some information on the bug.  \n\nIf all else fails, and you were unable to determine the right package, you may ask for help in IRC channels, or go ahead and report a bug against no particular package. Kindly note that this adds extra effort on our small group of volunteers, and you are requested to use it, as the title reads, only as a last resort. Also note that this may delay the process of resolution for your bug, and thats another reason to put in all the effort you can, to find the right package.\n\nYou may file a bug against no particular package by going here.\nStep three: Submitting the bug report\n(quoted verbatim from ReportingBugs for completeness.)\nAfter executing any of the above commands, Apport (Ubuntu bug-reporter) will collect necessary data. A window will then pop up, asking you if you want to report the bug. Click \"Send Report\" if you wish to proceed, or click \"Content of the report\" if you want to review the information Apport collected.  \n\n\nApport will then upload the problem information to Launchpad, and a\n  new browser window will then open to inform you that the bug report is\n  being processed. After the bug report data has been processed, a new\n  page will open that will ask you for the bug report's title. The bug\n  title will appear in all bug listings so make sure it represents the\n  bug well. When you're done, click \"Next\".   A search will then occur\n  based on the title you gave to the bug report, and will show\n  potentially similar ones. If one of these seems to be the exact bug\n  you're reporting, click its title, then \"Yes, this is the bug I'm\n  trying to report\". If not, click \"No, I need to report a new bug\".\n  Launchpad will then ask you for further information. It's important\n  that you specify three things:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*What you expected to happen\n  \n*What actually happened\n  \n*If possible, a minimal series of steps necessary to make it happen, where step 1 is \"start the program\" \n  \n  \n  Fill in the description field with as much information as you can, it\n  is better to have too much information in the description than not\n  enough.\nAt then bottom of the page, there are some extra options you can use\n  to make your bug report more complete:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*This bug is a security vulnerability: Please check this only if your bug report describes a behaviour that could be exploited to crack\n  your system. (TODO: better wording?)\n  \n*Tags: You can add here tags that pertain to your bug report. The predefined values should be left alone.\n  \n*Include an attachment: Using this option, you can add supporting attachments to explain or help others reproduce the bug. This might\n  include a screenshot, a video capture of the problem or a sample\n  document that triggers the fault. Additional attachments, if\n  necessary, can be added after the bug is reported via Add a\n  comment/attachment at the bottom of the page.\n\nWhen you're done, click \"Submit bug report\".\nIf you require to collect data while off-line, u may use apport-cli for that.

I've got an external terabyte drive to store my scrap (actually I mean a partition on it, I've got some other partitions there). The FS used is ext3. Even after I delete some files there (so there are at least some hundreds mibs free), Nautilus shows zero free space there and does not allow to even create a directory. How to fix this?\nI use Ubuntu 10.10 daily build, last updated ton the day before yesterday (Oct 03, 2010).\n\nA: ext2/3/4 filesystems have a certain percentage of blocks reserved for a\n\"privileged\" user; a filesystem might appear as \"almost full\" yet only\nroot can write to it.  My guess is that you are hitting this limit.\nBy default 5% of the total filesystem size is reserved for the root\nuser.  Both the reserved percentage and the \"privileged\" user can be\nchanged with the tune2fs command.\nTo change the percentage of reserved blocks to 1%, run (as root):\ntune2fs -m 1 /dev/your_disk_partition_device\n\nYou can also set the reserved blocks percentage to 0, thus effectively\ndisabling this feature on a certain partition.\nTo change the privileged user, run (as root):\ntune2fs -u username /dev/your_disk_partition_device\n\nMore details on both options on the tune2fs man page.\n\nA: Sounds like a dud disk to me (not releasing the space).  Someone I was speaking to at the weekend was having the same problem with windows and a new 0.5TB HDD (I have no idea of the make I am afraid).  Deleting files would remove them, however the space was not being released.\nIs the Disk Utility reporting any SMART failure conditions?\n\nA: You should try to delete more things just in case, things don't tend to always work with an almost full drive, try using baobab or another directory size visualizer to find out what can and should be deleted.\n\nA: inodes\ndf -i / \n\ntune2fs -l /dev/disk\n\ntune2fs will tell you how many inodes were free at boot or mount time, df -i / will tell you how many inodes are free now.  You can see if you are out of inodes and from how long ago the filesystem was mounted whether or not it happened suddenly.  \nThen you can do this to figure out where the inodes are:  \n find / -xdev -printf '%h\\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -k 1 -n\n\nThat will tell you how many inodes are in each directory with whichever has the most will be at the bottom when output stops. The problem should be obvious as you'll most likely have one directory or two with millions of entries.\nholla @geek_king \n\nA: Processes can still occupy storage, even though the corresponding files have been deleted (filehandle is still open).\nFind these with lsof -nP \nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/68523/find-and-remove-large-files-that-are-open-but-have-been-deleted\n", "Q: How to recover dpkg from corrupted downloads?

The install worked fine, but the mouse and keyboard (both of which is usb) are unbearably laggy. This was also the case when I ran it from the live cd.\nThe strange part is that it works fine for the first few seconds when entering X. Then something happens in the background, and the mouse all of a sudden behaves like I'm playing some demanding 3d game on the highest setting. The keyboard is also laggy, and if I press more than a single key per second the key will be dropped, and only about every fifth character will actually appear on screen. Even stranger is that this lag also is present when a use ctrl+alt+f1 to switch to console mode.\nIf I immediately switch to console mode when booting, it works fine. Then when I switch back to X, it takes a couple of seconds and then it happens again.\nI've checked the logs, and the most suspicious message is:\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868940] irq 19: nobody cared (try booting with the \"irqpoll\" option)\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868946] Pid: 0, comm: swapper Not tainted 2.6.35-22-generic #33-Ubuntu\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868948] Call Trace:\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868950]  <IRQ>  [<ffffffff810cba5b>] __report_bad_irq+0x2b/0xa0\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868961]  [<ffffffff810cbc5c>] note_interrupt+0x18c/0x1d0\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868967]  [<ffffffff81085d10>] ? sched_clock_tick+0x60/0x90\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868970]  [<ffffffff810cc45d>] handle_fasteoi_irq+0xdd/0x110\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868974]  [<ffffffff8100cb12>] handle_irq+0x22/0x30\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868978]  [<ffffffff81590b2c>] do_IRQ+0x6c/0xf0\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868981]  [<ffffffff81589713>] ret_from_intr+0x0/0x11\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868983]  <EOI>  [<ffffffff810360fb>] ? native_safe_halt+0xb/0x10\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868990]  [<ffffffff81012ecd>] default_idle+0x3d/0x90\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868995]  [<ffffffff81008da3>] cpu_idle+0xb3/0x110\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.868999]  [<ffffffff8156f6fa>] rest_init+0x8a/0x90\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.869004]  [<ffffffff81aedc9d>] start_kernel+0x387/0x390\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.869007]  [<ffffffff81aed341>] x86_64_start_reservations+0x12c/0x130\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.869011]  [<ffffffff81aed43f>] x86_64_start_kernel+0xfa/0x109\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.869013] handlers:\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.869014] [<ffffffff81404bb0>] (usb_hcd_irq+0x0/0x90)\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.869019] [<ffffffff81404bb0>] (usb_hcd_irq+0x0/0x90)\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.869022] [<ffffffff81404bb0>] (usb_hcd_irq+0x0/0x90)\nOct  3 20:16:16 CHURCHILL kernel: [   70.869026] Disabling IRQ #19\n\nIRQ related issues, is from what I can tell, rather common.

After I've installed some language packs and spell checking dictionaries (I'd like to use with Firefox and OpenOffice) I've got tons of language variations installed. This makes very inconvenient to maintain dictionary additions, for example. Sometimes Firefox decides to switch to Australian, sometimes to UK dictionary, sometimes to US, etc.\nFor me, a Russian, English is just English, and German is just German. I think every English-speaking will understand me, may I write \"color\" or \"colour\", \"dialog\", or \"dialogue\" (I usually prefer classic UK spelling though, as a matter of a habit (as I was taught at school)). How to remove all those dialects?\n\nA: Emi Bcn from Launchpad said:\n\nLook at /usr/share/hunspell/ and delete all files you don't need/want. It's all!!\n\nIt worked for me except just in case I went to myspell and aspell folders too and erased the ones I didn't need.\n\nA: Though @chuo is correct that you can just delete the files in /usr/share/hunspell/ for locales that you don't want, much better is to uninstall the packages that deliver those files. To see the locale packages (myspell and hunspell) that you have installed, run\ndpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall | egrep \"^myspell-|^hunspell-\"\n\nthen for each locale you'd like to remove uninstall the package with a command like this\nsudo apt-get remove myspell-en-au\n\nFor my Ubuntu 14.04 installation I had myspell-en-au, myspell-en-za and myspell-en-gb which I uninstalled with the command\nsudo apt-get remove myspell-en-.*\n\n\nA: The problem is known, take look at bug 28226 and its duplicates. Feel free to vote for the bug using the \"This bug affects me too\" feature.\nTo summarize, English in Ubuntu means all variants (en-au, en-za, etc.), not just one. You could delete the individual spelling packages, myspell-en-* and hunspell-en-*, but that would also remove language-support-en, and I don't think that's what you want.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install bleachbit\nThen open bleachbit as a root, the first time it prompts you for the locales you want to left behind.. \nthen, mark the corresponding checkbox under \"system\".\nClick on \"preview\", then on \"delete\"\nand that's it :)\n\nA: To backup all non-US English dictionaries (remove --no-act after verifying what it'll do):\nsudo rename --no-act 's/$/.bak/' /usr/share/hunspell/en_!(US).{aff,dic} \n\nThen restart your browser and only US English shows up.\nIn the case of languages which are redundant since the files are symlinks to the canonical language files (like fr_BE):\nsudo find /usr/share/hunspell/ -type l \\( -name '*.aff' -o -name '*.dic' \\) -exec mv {} {}.bak \\;\n\n\nA: As far as modern versions of Ubuntu go—which use LibreOffice instead of OpenOffice—start by clearing out unused language packs. Find them with:\napt list --installed | grep firefox-locale\napt list --installed | grep libreoffice-help\napt list --installed | grep libreoffice-l10n\n\nThen execute the sudo apt remove command followed by a space‐separated list of the packages one wants to remove. After restarting Firefox, the list of spellchecking dictionaries will be reduced if those packages had dictionaries associated with them. (There’s no dictionary to remove for Chinese, for example.)\nThis still leaves to be addressed dictionaries associated with unused national locales. For Firefox, this can be addressed by creating a new dictionary directory containing symbolic links to only the dictionaries that one wants to use and linking this directory to Firefox using the spellchecker.dictionary_path preference.\nExample:\nmkdir ~/hunspell/\nln --symbolic /usr/share/hunspell/en_US.aff /usr/share/hunspell/en_US.dic /usr/share/hunspell/es_US.aff /usr/share/hunspell/es_US.dic ~/hunspell/\n\nAfter executing the above commands, open the about:config page in Firefox, and change the value of the spellchecker.dictionary_path preference so that it references the directory containing the symbolic links. In the preceding example, one would use the path value ~/hunspell. After restarting Firefox, there should only be two dictionaries offered for spellchecking: English (United States) and Spanish (United States).\n", "Q: How do I best enable Xinerama? Following the WoLpH's recommendation I am looking forward to enable Xinerama to set up 2 monitors to be 2 separate Gnome virtual desktops instead of one big.\nBut the thing I worry about is how to set it up correctly and not to harm Ubuntu's \"Monitor Preferences\" application, panel indicator applet or anything else.\nIf you have had any experience with Xinerama, would you be so kind to share?\nI use Ubuntu 10.10 on my Toshiba L10 laptop with Intel 82852/855GM onboard card. And I switch (which, AFAIK, can be an inconvenience with Cinerama) monitor configurations (detach all monitors but a laptop's built-in panel, attach monitors with different resolutions) pretty often (sometimes many times a day).\nAs Ubuntu was unable to detect my graphics, I was to create Xorg.conf already, which has solved most of my graphics problems.\nThe last time I have had experience with writing Xorg.conf manually and setting up Xinerama was about 7 years ago, with Slackware and Matrox MGA G550 card. And I definitely wouldn't like to edit Xorg.conf every time I need to switch my monitors configuration.\n\nA: Sorry to say, but Xinerama no longer works on the -intel driver, since the Feisty/Gutsy timeframe when the Intel developers introduced XRandr.\nMaybe if you explain what you're trying to achieve with the dual displays, someone could suggest an alternative approach.\n\nA: In the ServerLayout section in your xorg.conf you should add something like this:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Option \"Xinerama\" \"on\"\n    Option \"Clone\" \"off\"\nEndSection\n\nThat should be enough to make sure xinerama works properly. If you don't have it already, you should add something like this aswell:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Screen 0 \"first-screen\"\n    Screen 1 \"second-screen\" RightOf \"first-screen\"\nEndSection\n\n", "Q: Profiling stock Ubuntu kernel with sysprof: how? There are various system-wide debug tools (sysprof, oprofile, systemtap) that need debug symbols.  Getting debug symbols for userspace applications is easy: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash\nThe ddebs repository also contains linux-image-$(uname -r)-dbgsym packages, but even if I install it, sysprof continues to show me unhelpful \"in kernel\" without detailed information.  Where can I get debug symbols that sysprof can use?\nThe systemtap package has a Suggests: linux-debug-2.6.  Apt-cache search fails to find anything called linux-debug-2.6.  Is it available somewhere?  Or is this an unproductive dead-end?\nIncidentally, oprofile can use the debug symbols from the above-mentioned dbgsym package, but not out of the box -- it wants\n/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/vmlinux, and I have to tell it to use use /usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r)-generic.  But oprofile lacks a nice GUI, so I'd prefer sysprof.\nSo, how can I convince sysprof to show me what's happening in the kernel?\n\nA: As far as I can tell, I was mistaken and sysprof doesn't actually provide any level of detail beyond \"in kernel\".

Check: http://projects.gnome.org/evince/?guid=ON\n\nA: To me, the most suitable solution on my 12.04 computer was to convert the XPS file to PDF on the command line through\nxpstopdf file.xps\n\nand viewing the newly created file.pdf using whatever PDF viewer (acroread in my case).\nThis required installing the package libgxps-utils.\n(Evince did not open the XPS file that I ran into, at least out of the box, but complained \"File type Zip archive (application/zip) is not supported\".)\n\nA: If you want to create XPS files, your best bet may be to try to build the GhostXPS component of GhostPDL (part of the Ghostscript suite); I don't know if this has ever been pacakged for Ubuntu, and I don't have first-hand experience with it.\nInkscape can both read and write .xaml files. I suppose it could even be used to convert, e.g., .pdf or .svg to .xaml. I don't know, however, whether or not it can handle .xps files directly (perhaps not).\n\nA: Okular, the KDE pdf viewer, supports XPS. The package name is okular I'm not aware of any GNOME/GTK+ viewers that support XPS, though according to this evince bug in upstream GNOME support has been added. It's not working for me in Maverick....\n", "Q: Can I set up Nautilus to use transparent background? I think it'd be nice if Nautilus windows could have semi-transparent backgrounds (same as Gnome terminal can) for files and places lists. Is it possible?\n\nA: You can use Compiz settings manager (you need to install \"compizconfig-settings-manager\" package, and then run the \"CompizConfig manager\" from the \"System->Preferences\" menu).\nUnder the \"Accessibility\" item, you have \"opacity, luminosity\" option. There you can define the opacity (and then, transparency) of your windows, and you can set it based on the window title or type...\n If you create a new item here, you can type \"class=Nautilus\" and select the transparency you want. Then all Nautilus windows will be transparent.\n\nA: The desktop window, created by Nautilus and most other DE, also have type property set to Desktop. In ccsm it should look like type=Desktop.\n", "Q: Gwibber is not using Indicator Applet or loading on start up I'm currently using the 10.10 beta of Ubuntu with the most recent updates installed. When I boot up the computer, gwibber fails to start up and when I do open it, it shows an icon in the notification area (which I do not want) and it doesn't use the indicator applet at all (even when closed).\n \n\nA: Do you have python-indicate installed?  It would be installed by default, but might not be installed on upgrade if you had removed it in the past.\nIf you don't have python-indicate, install that and restart gwibber.\nIf you do have python-indicate, please look in the log file at ~/.cache/gwibber/gwibber.log for anything interesting and maybe run gwibber-service in debug mode to collect more info:\ngwibber-service -d\n\n\nA: If you want it to start on startup make sure its on the list and checked in the services/startup items settings. If it isn't there add gwibber after login make sure     gwibber-service is running(its what does the indicator applet I think).\n\nA: I had the same problem and I do have python-indicate installed and I couldn't find anything that can point me out to what's going on on the log files. I noticed that I had 3 or 4 log files. So, to be able to know which one was the one I just decided to delete all the log files. And after that Gwibber worked, now it's showing in the indicator applet :)\n\nA: I had a similar problem with Gwibber. \nI solved it editing the file /etc/xdg/autostart/gwibber.desktop (in a terminal, put: sudo gedit /etc/xdg/autostart/gwibber.desktop without the quotation marks) and changing the value of \"X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay\" from 30 to 5.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why are apt-get updates in development releases slower? When i update apt-get the universe repo takes ages to download, I usually max out at around 130kbps which can easily download ~4mb in under a minute yet it skips between going an bytes per second and under 30kpbs (and i'm not running anything that leaches my bandwidth when i update).

If you look in the output from your terminal you get several entries along the lines of:\nHit http://country.archive.ubuntu.com maverick/universe Sources\n\nDuring the development period, every package update in the 'universe' section (there are also 'restricted', 'multiverse' and 'main' sections)  requires a change to this file.

I installed \"indicator-applet-appmenu\" and tried the same for \"global menu\". It does not work for the most of applications and does not seem convenient with my monitors configuration. \nThe problem is, that now (despite I have no \"appmenu applet\" active), some applications, for example UEx (UltraEdit for Linux) don't show their menus in their windows, so I need to activate global menu applet to use them. \nHow can I fix this? I am afraid (because I am on a 3G connection with limited traffic) that if I just remove indicator-applet-appmenu package, the problem won't solve and I will loose the last way to access menus in those programs.\n\nA: This appears to be a bug. Ultraedit probably needs to be tested, you can help contribute by checking out how to debug the menu here: \nhttp://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopExperienceTeam/ApplicationMenu \nFor the menu itself, just remove the applet from the panel, no need to remove the package. \n", "Q: How to disable windows' contents being moved on dragging, so that only the frame is dragged and the whole window is only redrawn on drop? How to disable windows' contents being moved on dragging, so that only the frame is dragged and the whole window is only redrawn on drop?\nIn Windows, KDE and XFCE this can be easily configured, but in Gnome (Ubuntu 10.10) I couldn't find where to set this up :-(\n\nA: First, disable desktop effects to get metacity instead of compiz.  Then open gconf-editor, find /apps/metacity/general, and enable reduced_resources.  Here's a description of that option:\n\nIf true, metacity will give the user less feedback by using wireframes, avoiding animations, or other means. This is a significant reduction in usability for many users, but may allow legacy applications to continue working, and may also be a useful tradeoff for terminal servers. However, the wireframe feature is disabled when accessibility is on. \n\nAs far as I know there's no option to enable it through the GUI, gconf is the only way.\n", "Q: Pulseaudio playing surround through headset I am using XUbuntu 10.04, and I am having issues with the sound.

However, I would like to have it build by apt-build instead of installing the binary version with apt-get. So it doen't work for me. Adding the repository again didn't work for me either.\nEDIT\nSolved! Seems like apt-build needs all deb-src repositories it should use inside /etc/apt/sources.list . By adding the PPA via apt-add-repository a separate file for each new repository gets created (inside /etc/apt/sources.list.d). So putting the two line directly into /etc/sources.list and running\n\nsudo apt-build update && sudo apt-build --reinstall install chromium-browser\n\nfixed the issue for me.

For instance, I have lots of them in my /usr/share/applications/ folder. \nIf I open that folder in nautilus, I can run these applications just by double clicking its associated file, e.g. double-clicking firefox.desktop runs Firefox. However, I can't find a way to do the same thing via terminal. \nIf I do gnome-open foo.desktop it simply opens foo.desktop as a text file. If I make it executable and then run it in bash it simply fails (which is expected, it's clearly not bash script).\nEDIT: Doing exec /fullpath/foo.desktop gives me a Permission denied message, even if I change ownership to myself. If I make executable and do the same command, the terminal tab I'm using simply closes (I'm guessing it crashes). Finally, if I do sudo exec /fullpath/foo.desktop, I get an error reporting sudo: exec: command not found.\nThat's my question, how can I run a foo.desktop file from the terminal?\n\nA: Addendum to Hamish's answer.\nGiven the deskopen script, you can use a reference to it as the shebang line in a .desktop file, since the comment character is still #. That is to say, put this as the first line of the .desktop file:\n#!/usr/bin/env deskopen\n\nThen flag the .desktop file as executable (e.g. with a chmod +x whatever.desktop), and then you can\npath/to/whatever.desktop\n\nand voilà -- The app will open! (Complete with the icon file I specified, though I have no idea how.)\nNow, if you also want deskopen to pass through any command-line parameters, you can instead use this slightly-modified version:\n#!/bin/sh\ndesktop_file=$1\nshift\n`grep '^Exec' \"${desktop_file}\" | sed 's/^Exec=//' | sed 's/%.//'` \"$@\" &\n\nAs an aside, I tried using \"#{@:2}\" instead of shifting, but it kept giving me 'bad substitution'...\n\nA: Modern Answer\ngtk-launch <app-name> - where <app-name> is the file name of the .desktop file, with or without the .desktop extension.\nSee another answer on this thread for more details.  I got this info from that answer.\nDeprecated shell tools answer\nWritten a long time ago - see the comments below this answer as to why this approach won't work for many desktop files.\nThe command that is run is contained inside the desktop file, preceded by Exec= so you could extract and run that by:\n$(grep '^Exec' filename.desktop | tail -1 | sed 's/^Exec=//' | sed 's/%.//' \\\n| sed 's/^\"//g' | sed 's/\" *$//g') &\n\nTo break that down\ngrep  '^Exec' filename.desktop    # - finds the line which starts with Exec\n| tail -1                         # - only use the last line, in case there are \n                                  #   multiple\n| sed 's/^Exec=//'                # - removes the Exec from the start of the line\n| sed 's/%.//'                    # - removes any arguments - %u, %f etc\n| sed 's/^\"//g' | sed 's/\" *$//g' # - removes \" around command (if present)\n$(...)                            # - means run the result of the command run \n                                  #   here\n&                                 # - at the end means run it in the background\n\nYou could put this in a file, say ~/bin/deskopen with the contents\n#!/bin/sh\n$(grep '^Exec' $1 | tail -1 | sed 's/^Exec=//' | sed 's/%.//' \\\n| sed 's/^\"//g' | sed 's/\" *$//g') &\n\nThen make it executable\nchmod +x ~/bin/deskopen\n\nAnd then you could do, e.g.\ndeskopen /usr/share/applications/ubuntu-about.desktop\n\nThe arguments (%u, %F etc) are detailed here. None of them are relevant for launching at the command line.\n\nA: I don't have an immediate solution meeting the requirement for \"using a standard command\", but if you did want to minimally parse the .desktop files or wanted to create a Bash alias, then the following should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*awk -F= '/Exec=/{system($2); exit}' foo.desktop\nanother approach that might be interesting, would be to create a kernel-level binfmt-misc method than matches on .desktop files (see grep -r . /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/ for those patterns that you currently have enabled).\nAt the end of the day, something somewhere will have to parse the .desktop files, it's just a question of how \"standard/default\" that is.\n\nA: There isn't currently an application that does what you describe in the Ubuntu archives.  There are a couple efforts in progress to create a general solution to provide integration for desktop environments (like openbox) that are not compliant with these XDG specifications.\nArch Linux is working on an implementation of xdg-autostart based on the python-xdg libraries.  From what I can find, this seems not yet entirely complete, but has some reports of success.\nThere is also a C++ implementation of xdg-autostart on gitorious (http://gitorious.org/xdg-autostart/) which would likely benefit from wider use.\nIf either solution works for you, please consider submitting the necessary work for inclusion in either Debian or Ubuntu.\nTo use either tool with openstart, you would call it in /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart.sh (if I am reading the openbox documentation correctly).  If this doesn't work, you can probably call it in any of the openbox session initialisation scripts.\n\nA: While OP was not asking about KDE, for anyone that is running KDE the following command can be used:\nkioclient exec <path-to-desktop-file>\nOn Fedora, this is included in the kde-runtime rpm. On Arch, it is in kde-cli-tools (HT: @Aron Cederholm).\n\nA: Since glib 2.67.2 there's a gio launch command that can be used like this:\ngio launch ./foo.desktop\n\n\nFor older releases I've got a quick workaround (stealing inspiration from the nautilus source code). It is a bit convoluted, but works flawlessly on Ubuntu 12.10, adding a meaningful icon (no more ?) on the Unity launcher.\nFirst, I wrote a python script using Gio and placed saved it as ~/bin/run-desktop :\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nfrom gi.repository import Gio\nimport sys \n\ndef main(myname, desktop, *uris):\n    launcher = Gio.DesktopAppInfo.new_from_filename(desktop)\n    launcher.launch_uris(uris, None)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main(*sys.argv)\n\nThe script needs  to have the executable permission, so I ran this in a terminal:\nchmod +x ~/bin/run-desktop\n\nThen I created the relative .desktop entry on ~/.local/share/applications/run-desktop.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=run-desktop\nExec=run-desktop %U\nMimeType=application/x-desktop\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\nFinally, I associated the entry as the default handler in ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list under the [Default Applications] section as :\n[Default Applications]\n....\napplication/x-desktop=run-desktop.desktop\n\nNow:\n\n*\n\n*xdg-open something.desktop works as expected\n\n*#!/usr/bin/xdg-open\nhashbang on top of an executable desktop entry works too\n\n\nA: You could use dex: generate and execute Application type .desktop files.\n\nDesktopEntry eXecution implements the Freedesktop.org autostart specification, independent of any desktop or window manager environment.\nApplications may be filtered based on the Desktop Environment advertised in the .desktop file.\n\nInstall dex:\nsudo apt install dex\n\nRun the file with it:\ndex foo.desktop\n\n\nA: The Right Way\nYou should really be using gtk-launch if it is available. It is usually part of the package libgtk-3-bin (this may vary by distro).\ngtk-launch is used as follows:\ngtk-launch APPLICATION [URI...]\ngtk-launch app-name.desktop\ngtk-launch app-name\n\nPlease note that gtk-launch requires the .desktop file to be installed (i.e. located in /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications).\nSo to get around this, we can use a hackish little Bash function that temporarily installs the desired .desktop file before launching it. The \"correct\" way to install a .desktop file is via desktop-file-install but I'm going to ignore that.\nlaunch(){\n\n    # Usage: launch PATH [URI...]\n\n    # NOTE: The bulk of this function is executed in a subshell, i.e. `(..)`\n    #       This isn't strictly necessary, but it keeps everything\n    #       out of the global namespace and lessens the likelihood\n    #       of side effects.\n\n    (\n\n    # where you want to install the launcher to\n    appdir=$HOME/.local/share/applications\n\n    # the template used to install the launcher\n    template=launcher-XXXXXX.desktop\n\n    # ensure $1 has a .desktop extension, exists, is a normal file, is readable, has nonzero size\n    # optionally use desktop-file-validate for stricter checking\n    # desktop-file-validate \"$1\" 2>/dev/null || {\n    [[ $1 = *.desktop && -f $1 && -r $1 && -s $1 ]] || {\n        echo \"ERROR: you have not supplied valid .desktop file\" >&2\n        return 1\n    }\n\n    # ensure the temporary launcher is deleted upon exit\n    trap 'rm \"$launcherfile\" &>/dev/null' EXIT\n\n    # create a temp file to overwrite later\n    launcherfile=$(mktemp -p \"$appdir\" \"$template\")\n\n    launchername=${launcherfile##*/}\n\n    # overwrite temp file with the launcher file\n    if cp \"$1\" \"$launcherfile\" &>/dev/null; then\n        gtk-launch \"$launchername\" \"${@:2}\"\n    else\n        echo \"ERROR: failed to copy launcher to applications directory\" >&2\n        return 1\n    fi\n\n    )\n\n}\n\nYou can use it like so (and also pass along additional arguments or URIs if you want):\nlaunch PATH [URI...]\nlaunch ./path/to/shortcut.desktop\n\n\nThe Manual Alternative\nIf you want to manually parse and execute a .desktop file, you can do so with the following awk command:\nawk '/^Exec=/ {sub(\"^Exec=\", \"\"); gsub(\" ?%[cDdFfikmNnUuv]\", \"\"); exit system($0)}' app-name.desktop\n\nIf you want to treat the awk command like an all-in-one script; we can even show an error message and exit with a return code of 1 in the event that an Exec command is not found:\nawk 'BEGIN {command=\"\"} /^Exec=/ {sub(\"^Exec=\", \"\"); gsub(\" ?%[cDdFfikmNnUuv]\", \"\"); command=$0; exit} END {if (command!=\"\") {exit system(command)} else {if (FILENAME == \"-\") {printf \"ERROR: Failed to identify Exec line\\n\" > \"/dev/stderr\"} else {printf \"ERROR: Failed to identify Exec line in \\047%s\\047\\n\", FILENAME > \"/dev/stderr\"} close(\"/dev/stderr\"); exit 1}}'\n\nThe aforementioned commands will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the line starting with Exec=\n\n*Remove Exec=\n\n*Remove any Exec variables (e.g. %f, %u, %U). It is possible to replace these with positional arguments as the specification intends, but doing so would add significant complexity to the problem. See latest Desktop Entry Specification.\n\n*Execute the command\n\n*Immediately exit with the appropriate exit code (so as to not execute multiple Exec lines)\n\n\nNote, this AWK script addresses a few edge cases that may or may not be properly addressed by some of the other answers. Specifically, this command removes multiple Exec variables (taking care not to otherwise remove the % symbol), will only execute a single Exec line command, and will behave as expected even if the Exec line command contains one or more equals sign (e.g. script.py --profile=name).\nJust a few other caveats... According to the specification, TryExec is:\n\nPath to an executable file on disk used to determine if the program is actually installed. If the path is not an absolute path, the file is looked up in the $PATH environment variable. If the file is not present or if it is not executable, the entry may be ignored (not be used in menus, for example).\n\nWith that in mind, it doesn't make sense to execute it's value.\nSome other concerns are Path and Terminal. Path consists of the working directory to run the program in. Terminal is a boolean that indicates whether the program is run in a terminal window. These can all be addressed, but there's no sense in reinventing the wheel as there are already implementations of the spec. If you do want to implement Path, keep in mind that system() spawns a subprocess, so you can't change working directory by doing something like system(\"cd \\047\" working_directory \"\\047\"); system(command). However you could presumably do something like system(\"cd \\047\" working_directory \"\\047 && \" command). Note \\047 are single quotes (so the command doesn't break on paths with spaces).\nThe Python Alternative\nI'm stealing a page from Carlo here, who suggested creating a Python script to make use of the gi module. Here's a minimal way to execute the same code from the shell without having to create a file and worry about I/O.\nlaunch(){\n\n# Usage: launch PATH [URI...]\n\npython - \"$@\" <<EOF\nimport sys\nfrom gi.repository import Gio\nGio.DesktopAppInfo.new_from_filename(sys.argv[1]).launch_uris(sys.argv[2:])\nEOF\n\n}\n\nThen execute the launcher function as follows:\nlaunch ./path/to/shortcut.desktop\n\nNote the use of URIs is optional. Also, no error checking is performed so you'll want to ensure the launcher exists and is readable (before using it) if you want your script to be durable.\n\nA: exo-open [[path-to-a-desktop-file]...]\n\nseems to work in 13.10 release, if exo-utils is installed (like is the case with Xubuntu).\n\nA: This SO answer is what made it clear for me: don't try to execute the desktop file, execute the file pointed to in the desktop file.\nFor example, execute /home/jsmith/Desktop/x11vnc.sh\nExec=/home/jsmith/Desktop/x11vnc.sh\n\n\nA: Hamish's answer is great, but I'd like suggest a simpler alternative, with less piping involved:\n$(awk -F= '/^Exec/||/^TryExec/ {print $2;exit}' /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop)\nIn this case, awk searches for line starting with Exec, and then we simply print fields after that line, using for loop and = we print field 2, i.e., whatever comes after that field. The curly brackets on the ends of the commands,  $(...), are parameter substitution, thus shell will execute whatever awk command returns; in this case, it returns actual command that comes after Exec=. \nIn some rare cases there may be more than one = sign, which is still a possibility. For that, I suggest \n$(awk -F= '/^Exec/||/^TryExec/ {for(i=2;i<=NF;i++) print $i;exit}' /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop)\n\n\nA: I took the script from Carlo's answer above, and made an attempt to improve on it for my own desktop use.  \nThis version of the script will allow you to run any app as if you entered it on the HUD, so long as it's likely to be the first result.  It also lets you pass file arguments for .desktop files that do not support URIs.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom gi.repository import Gio\nfrom argparse import ArgumentParser\nimport sys, os\n\ndef find_app(search_string):\n    for group in Gio.DesktopAppInfo.search(search_string):\n        for entry in group:\n            try:\n                return Gio.DesktopAppInfo.new(entry)\n            except: pass\n    return None\n\ndef main(args):\n    launcher = None\n    if os.path.isfile(args.appName):\n        try:\n        # If it's a file, do that first.\n            launcher = Gio.DesktopAppInfo.new_from_filename(args.appName)\n        except TypeError:\n            print \"'\" + args.appName + \"' is not a .desktop file\"\n            sys.exit(-1)\n    # If it's a .desktop file in the DB, try using that\n    if launcher is None and args.appName.endswith('.desktop'):\n        try:\n            launcher = Gio.DesktopAppInfo.new(args.appName)\n        except TypeError: pass\n\n    if launcher is None:\n        # Search for the app by the text given\n        launcher = find_app(args.appName)\n\n    if launcher is None:\n        print \"No app named \" + args.appName + \" could be found\"\n        sys.exit(-1)\n    if (launcher.supports_uris()):\n        launcher.launch_uris(args.uris, None)\n    elif (launcher.supports_files()):\n        launcher.launch(list({ Gio.File.parse_name(x) for x in args.uris }), None)\n    else :\n        launcher.launch()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    argParser = ArgumentParser(description=\"Launch a .desktop file or application\")\n    argParser.add_argument(\"appName\", \n        help=\"the name of any application, a desktop file's basename, or a concrete path to a desktop file\", \n        action='store'\n    )\n    argParser.add_argument(\"uris\", \n        nargs='*', \n        help=\"Files or URIs to pass to the application\"\n    )\n    args = argParser.parse_args()\n    main(args)\n\n\nA: gtk-launch\nWith any recent Ubuntu that supports gtk-launch just simply go\ngtk-launch <file>\n\nWhere <file> is the name of the .desktop file with or without the .desktop part. The name must not include the full path.\nThe .desktop file must be in /usr/share/applications, /usr/local/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications.\nSo gtk-launch foo opens /usr/share/applications/foo.desktop (or foo.desktop located in one of the other permitted directories.)\nFrom gtk-launch documentation:\n\ngtk-launch launches an application using the given name. The application is started with proper startup notification on a default display, unless specified otherwise.\ngtk-launch takes at least one argument, the name of the application to launch. The name should match application desktop file name, as residing in /usr/share/application, with or without the '.desktop' suffix.\n\nUsable from terminal or Alt + F2 (Alt + F2 stores command in history so it's easily accessible).\n\nA: (Compiled from the various other answers here)\nDepending on your system, and the various bugs that may or may not exist on your system, try the following until one of them works:\n\n*\n\n*xdg-open program_name.desktop\n\n*exo-open program_name.desktop [my preferred choice, whenever it works]\n\n*gtk-launch program_name.desktop\n\n*kioclient exec program_name.desktop\n\n*dex program_name.desktop\n\n*Or, here's a command from @Hamish Downer which grep-searches the *.desktop file for the Exec= line containing the command to execute, removes parts of that line we don't want, then executes it. It is well-written and works well for most desktop files. See his answer for a full explanation of it.\n# To execute the `Exec=` cmd from filename.desktop in the background\n$(grep '^Exec' filename.desktop | tail -1 | sed 's/^Exec=//' \\\n| sed 's/%.//' | sed 's/^\"//g' | sed 's/\" *$//g') &\n\n# Or, remove the `&` at the end to execute it in the foreground so you \n# can see output from running the command too\n$(grep '^Exec' filename.desktop | tail -1 | sed 's/^Exec=//' \\\n| sed 's/%.//' | sed 's/^\"//g' | sed 's/\" *$//g')\n\nNote that on Ubuntu systems, your \"start menu\" desktop launchers are available in /usr/share/applications/.\nAs an example, to show which of the above commands do or don't work on my Ubuntu 14.04 system, here are the results of the following calls for me:\n\n*\n\n*xdg-open /usr/share/applications/eclipse_for_cpp.desktop # Fails due to bug (tries to have me save this .desktop file)\n\n*exo-open /usr/share/applications/eclipse_for_cpp.desktop # Works\n\n*gtk-launch /usr/share/applications/eclipse_for_cpp.desktop # Fails with \"gtk-launch: no such application\"\n\n*kioclient exec /usr/share/applications/eclipse_for_cpp.desktop # Works\n\n*dex /usr/share/applications/eclipse_for_cpp.desktop # Fails, & sudo apt install dex cannot locate package dex\n\n*$(grep '^Exec' /usr/share/applications/eclipse_for_cpp.desktop | tail -1 | sed 's/^Exec=//' | sed 's/%.//' | sed 's/^\"//g' | sed 's/\" *$//g') & # Works\n\n\nA: The answer should be\nxdg-open program_name.desktop\n\nBut due to a bug (here upstream, closed on 2020-12-09) this no longer works.\n\nA: When trying to test these files I found the simplest way to check that that the DM or session manager would do what I expected was to open the surrounding dir in a UI folder browser and then double-click to open them.\nIf you are in a command line : gvfs-open . or gnome-open . will open it in the configured folder browser.\nThe sed thing will not mirror the DM's behaviour, including fiddly stuff like escapes and quoting where you really wouldn't want alternative behaviour. It's not command line, but it did validate things. I also found setting Terminal=true useful for debugging.\n\nA: Make sure the script your desktop file points to is executable too.\nIf still doesn't work. Make desktop file runnable in terminal by changing Terminal=true, and put it inside a bash script. Run the script to catch the error output. Change back when errors are corrected.\n\nA: In my experience with trying the above answers, gtk-launch does not provide any helpful diagnostic information, and is slightly misleading, reporting \"not found\" as the cause of the error rather than the real root cause.  The best I could come up with was installing rofi with sudo apt install rofi and then launching it from the terminal with:\nrofi -show drun\n\nThen, I selected my application using its fuzzy-finder, and after pressing enter, it actually gave me the real reason for why the *.desktop file would not launch (in my case, I had quotes around the Exec-line in my *.desktop file).\nDoes anybody know where the source-code is for gtk-launch? This really seems like we should create a PR for giving better, more accurate error messages, as this seems to be a prevalent problem when searching around the net.\nEdit1: I found the gtk-launch source here\n\nA: cd /usr/share/applications\ngio launch program_name.desktop\nSee https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/54\n\nA: \"I am using Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla)\"\nJust open the terminal and then navigate to that folder where .desktop file is located and then type\nchmod +x (name of desktop file)\n./(name of desktop file)\n\n", "Q: Dependency cycle upgrading to 10.04 LTS I've got the following error while attempting to upgrade from 8.04 to v 10.04.

How can I do this?\nThe power options lid close option is set to do nothing.\n\nA: Actions to take when closing the laptop lid are configured with command gnome-power-preferences (menu: System -> Preferences -> Power management)\nYou will need to set two options: \"When laptop lid is closed\" to \"Do nothing\", and also \"Put computer to sleep when inactive for\" to \"Never\" (otherwise the laptop won't sleep automatically when you close the lid, but will soon afterwards because it's inactive).

Whenever I am downloading packages using Ubuntu Software Center (or any package manager for that matter), my Internet connection slows to an absolute crawl. In fact, most requests timeout.\nIs there a way to limit the bandwidth that Software Center uses when downloading packages?\n\nA: If the software centre uses apt-get (and I'm not actually sure that it does, so you will need to try this yourself), you should be able to do the following:\nCreate the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/76download with the following content:\nAcquire\n{\n    Queue-mode \"access\";\n    http\n    {\n        Dl-Limit \"150\";\n    };\n};\n\nThat limits apt-get to 150KB/s.

The files are output as Quicktime MOV files.\nMy question is:\nIs there a command-line tool that allows me to shrink the video down to a lower resolution/size for quicker uploading? I'm thinking something like ImageMagick's convert but for video.\n\nA: I use those options with ffmpeg (example with a video of 1m40s of 725MB 4096x2304):\nMP4 conversion, Medium video quality with sound codec aac(245MB):\nffmpeg -i a.mov -f mp4 -vcodec libx264 -preset fast -profile:v main -acodec aac output.mp4\n\nMP4 conversion, Medium video quality with sound codec mp2(218MB):\nffmpeg -i a.mov -f mp4 -vcodec libx264 -preset fast -profile:v main -acodec mp2 output.mp4\n\nAvi conversion, Low quality (120MB)\nffmpeg -i a.mov b.avi\n\nIn addition you can reduce resolution with option\n-vf scale=1024:576\n\nMP4 conversion, Medium video quality with sound codec aac with rescaling (21MB):\nffmpeg -i a.mov -f mp4 -vcodec libx264 -preset fast -profile:v main -acodec aac -vf scale=1024:576 output.mp4\n\n\nA: There are a number video transcoders that you could use to covert mov files to different formats suitable for uploading. Handbrake is a popular one that has both a GUI and command-line version (handbrake-gtk or handbrake-cli). To use Handbreak on Ubuntu, you need to add a PPA:\nhttps://edge.launchpad.net/~handbrake-ubuntu/+archive/ppa or the more current https://launchpad.net/~stebbins/+archive/ubuntu/handbrake-releases\nI personally like, transmageddon which is a GUI app with nice simple pre-sets. It's available in the archives.\n\nAnother option is arista, another GUI transcoder available in the archives. In fact, it is a \"Featured Application\" in Ubuntu Software Center.\nffmpeg is another command line option that offers a lot of flexibility but can be a bit complex. \n", "Q: How can I automatically run a command when I log out? I'd like to make a command run every time I log out. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: If you are speaking of logging out of a bash login shell, there's a solution with ~/.bash_logout — Run man bash in the terminal for more details.\nIf you are speaking of logging out of the X-window system, there are far too many ways to get yourself \"logged out\" for there to be any way to guarantee the command will run.\nHowever, since you are the one doing the logging out, if you change your logout habit, this might work...\nIf you are running gnome, you might want to write a short script - maybe called \"logo\" - put it in ~/bin (and ensure ~/bin is in your PATH).\nThe \"logo\" script would do two things:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Run whatever command you want to run when you logout.\n\n*Run gnome-session-save with your choice of arguments.\n\n\nRun man gnome-session-save in the terminal for more details on the arguments.\n", "Q: What happens if I delete the default folders in my home folder? What are the consequences of deleting any of these?\n\ne.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*How will applications that expect them to be present behave?\n\n*Where will the items on my desktop go?\n\n\nA: I always delete all except Desktop and Templates without any obvious problems.\nIf you delete Templates (and don't assign a new user-dir for it), the right-click-Create-Document feature in Nautilus becomes less useful. If you delete Desktop and don't assign it, your home directory becomes the Desktop folder. Which can be a bit cluttered, especially if you have dotfiles shown.\n\nA: Those folders are \"well known\" user folders defined by Freedesktop (check here: http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs).\nIn Ubuntu 10.04 you can edit the file ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs to change the location of those folders. When you've change the file you need to restart nautilus (run 'nautilus -q' in a terminal or log out an in again).\n/N\n\nA: Where will my items on my desktop go?\nI am afraid to imagine :-) To be serious - either to your trashcan or straight to hell if you don't use trashcan. I, personally, don't use trashcan, but I have dedicated a separate partition (/dat) to store all my scrap and made all those folders you mention just a symlinks to there (so that /home actually only stores configuration dot-files and so I separate software configs andmy precious data), so, if I delete them, they'll remain in my /dat.\n", "Q: How do I change the folder icons in the \"Places\" menu?

Unfortunately we do not have any influence on how this data is stored (e.g. we cannot change the programs to (un)gzip the xml files when they are loaded/saved, they are provided by a 3rd party and we are required to use these programs by contract).\nSince our hard disks are overflowing regularly I wonder whether there is such a thing like NTFS compression for Ubuntu/Linux for compressing these files transparently for the clients.\nSome more background:\n\n\n*\n\n*Processing these files always means that they are read completely into memory, changed there and written back.\n\n*Only one client will access a directory of these files at a time so there are no concurrency and locking issues.\n\n*The server already has 4x 2TB data drives. There is no more physical space to add more (and I would like to avoid adding more disks)\n\n*The data must be kept active for about two years, after that it will be archived and deleted from the disks.\n\n\nI think the perfect solution would be some kind of plug in to the samba server that gets called whenever a file which matches a given wildcard / regex is created / written or read which uses gzip / ungzip to compress / uncompress the file on the fly.\nAlternatively I could imagine a windows file system driver that does the same on the client side.\nI would like to avoid any manual steps in this process because it is too error prone.\nIs there something like this? I have already used Google but could not find any solution.\n(I would have liked to create a compression tag for this but I am not allowed to do that yet.)\n\nA: You could mount a compressing filesystem on a directory within the SAMBA share, and save your XML files in that.  FUSE provides at least three filesystems that could be used for this purpose: compFUSEd, FuseCompress and LZOlayer_fs.  \nThere is also a kernel patch for plugging transparent compression into the ext2 filesystem but it has a track record of being abandoned and then taken up again, it's for ext2 only (not ext3/4), and it's definitely more invasive than using FUSE.\n\nA: It's ten years later now and I finally found the answer to the question: ZFS\nAbout its many features there is transparent compression using gzip (fast) and other algorithms (compress better but are slower/require more CPU time).\nIt is also pretty mature so I have no doubts about its reliability. And since it is now part of most Linux distribution there is no question about compatibility either.\n", "Q: Empathy doesn't seem to be saving my display picture Hey how do I force empathy to save my display pic? I have tried to set it (in different formats and sizes) over a dozen times, all I get is this little silver man.\n\n\n\nA: I think pictures are stored on the protocol server, not on your local Empathy client (except maybe as cached data), so you should be able to upload a profile picture from any account/profile management web page.

Background: I want to manipulate the order of the names.\n-- \n[[This is the most counter-intuitive forum site I have dealt with yet.]]\n\nA: As far as I know, there is no easy way to configure the order of names: Names are ordered by their login frequency as returned by ConsoleKit (see the output ofck-history --frequent).

Several special keys, most importantly the 'eject' button, are not working on my keyboard. \nThe only way I can eject my DVD drive is by opening up a terminal and typing 'eject'. When I press the eject button on my keyboard it gives the following message in the logs so it is registering the button being pressed but it is not doing anything.

Its a Packard Bell EasyNote TX86 and I'm running Lucid Lynx. Any ideas? \n\nA: Install KeyTouch. If your keyboard is not supported out of the box, you need both the keytouch and keytouch-editor packages. Run the keytouch editor, and configure your keyboard (it's probably not exactly a 9205, possibly completely different, given that the 9205 is not a laptop keyboard).\nThe reason xev doesn't see the multimedia keys is that the kernel doesn't transmit them if they haven't been properly introduced (that's what the “unknown key released, use setkeycodes” messages mean). KeyTouch will do it (in a more user-friendly way than setkeycodes), and will also handle the higher-level aspects such as configuring the eject key to eject the CD.\nThe Right key not working is a bit worrying however. Does it trigger kernel messages? It should have worked out of the box, since it's a standard key.\nOther relevant Ubuntu wiki pages are Hotkeys/Troubleshooting (but try KeyTouch first) and Hotkeys/Architecture (explaining this is not as simple a it should be under the hood).\n", "Q: How can I bind a key to cycle between workspaces?

Up to 2048x1536 (according to spec)\n\n*One 42'' TV/Monitor connected to the splitter via its VGA input\n\n*Two 32'' TV/Monitor connected to the splitter via its VGA input\n\n\nProblem\nWith that configuration, Ubuntu only shows 640x480 and 800x800 as possible resolutions. However, if I connect any of the TV/Monitor directly to the PC (via VGA) then Ubuntu shows a long list of possible resolution (I tried several of them and they worked fine).\nIt seems that X Window System automatic configuration is not working properly. How do I manually configure it? What info should knows of the different devices involved beforehand?\n\nContext: The monitors are intalled in public spaces across one building to display dynamic information that is processed in the PC (a Flash presentation running in Firefox in fullscreen mode).\nUpdate:\nI tried the following, as the link provided in the answers said:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the modeline for the resolution using cvt\n\n*Created the new mode using xrandr --newmode\n\n*Added the mode to the output display using xrandr --addmode\n\n*Tried to change the resolution using xrandr --output ... --mode ...\nBut I get this: xrandr screen cannot be larger than 800x600 (desired size ...)\n\nA: Here's how monitor autodetection works:  Every monitor's firmware contains a chunk of data called EDID which encodes the monitor's resolutions and refresh rates and so on.  The video driver makes a hardware call to retrieve this data, via the video card / monitor connection.\nSplitters (like KVMs) manipulate the path from the card to the monitor.  Some KVMs pass the EDID properly, others don't.  My guess is that your splitter is not allowing the EDID to be passed back.\nIndeed, I would guess that the system call has a built-in assumption that only one EDID chunk is present on a given connector, so even if it was returning something, it probably wouldn't be what you wanted.\nAlso, while all monitors return EDID, some TVs don't, or return a corrupted EDID.  But since you tested it without the splitter and it worked correctly, I don't think this problem affects you.\nDifferent monitors support different sets of resolutions and frequencies, but all monitors are required by the VESA Standard to support at least two:  640x480 and 800x600.  So when X doesn't know anything about the monitor connected to it, it falls back to those two resolutions.  That's why those are the only ones you see available.\nAnyway, I think in this case you can't rely on EDID to get your monitors magically auto-configured.  Instead, you'll need to manually specify the data yourself.\nIf you had specified your video driver or linked to your Xorg.0.log, I could give you more specific info.  The procedure varies depending on what video driver you're using.  If it is a KMS-enabled driver like -intel or -ati you have to specify it via the kernel.  If you have KMS turned off or are using a non-KMS driver, but the driver supports RANDR (e.g. -fglrx), you can add a modeline using the xrandr command line tool such as documented at the bottom of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution.  If you are using a non-KMS, non-RANDR driver such as -nvidia, it is controlled entirely in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf; in this latter case you'll need to look up the vertical and horizontal refresh rates for all the monitors (hopefully they're all close to the same ranges, else you're screwed), and then specify those via the HorizSync and VertRefresh options in xorg.conf.  You'll also need to add the resolution in the xorg.conf.  Possibly you may need to construct a ModeLine as well, but I'll bet just the HorizSync and VertRefresh will be enough.\nGood luck, and if you get stuck be sure to post your /var/log/Xorg.0.log.\n\nA: It looks like X isn't able to correctly detect the resolution of the splitter.\nYou can force it to use arbitrary resolutions using xrand. There are some  documentation on it, check the Adding undetected resolutions section and the Setting Xrand change persistent.\n", "Q: Is there a rational reason to wait for the release date to download, install or update to the next version of Ubuntu? Today, October 6th 2010, Ubuntu 10.10 is in Feature Definition Freeze, Debian Import Freeze, Feature Freeze, User Interface Freeze, Beta Freeze, Documentation String Freeze, Final Freeze, Kernel Freeze and past the Translation Deadlines in both the non-language pack and language pack editions as the release schedule details.\nBasically, except for last minute bugfixes, the version of Ubuntu 10.10 you can download today is identical to the version of Ubuntu 10.10 you can download on the 10th when it gets released.\nIf you downloaded and installed Ubuntu 10.10 today, you would:\n\n\n*\n\n*help find glaring issues for last minute fixing\n\n*help defray the network load on October 10th\n\n*see Ubuntu 10.10 in action without waiting\n\n\nThose sound like pretty strong arguments... to me, and indeed I've been using Ubuntu 10.10 for a month now roughly. However, most people prefer to make the jump with everybody else on release day.\nWhat are the rational reasons for that?\n\nA: If you use a computer for work, any bug may still affect you (either seriously, or just make you lose some time), so you might want to take a conservative approach and upgrade when the new release has been officially released and the first \"new release bugs\" have been ironed out.\nOn the other hand, if you have time and skill on your hands, you are very much welcome to install the pre-release Ubuntu and help the developers by reporting any bugs you find.\nIn the end, I guess it just boils down to how much time you can spend on the new shiny Ubuntu :-)\n\nA: If you require a super-stable working environment, I'd recommend waiting until the first Stable Release Updates (SRUs) are available. This usually happens within a few days of the official release. As the non-LTS releases tend to have more progressive enhancements and new features, they can contain bugs that have sneaked past the initial testing. \nAlso, waiting for the official release gives a chance to enjoy the growing excitement and buzz within the community (if you use irc, Twitter or identi.ca you'll know what I mean) :)\n\nA: My name is msw and I'm an upgrade junkie.\nOkay, now that that's out of the way, for the installations that I have made on friends' machines who \"just want stuff to work\", there is no reason at all to ever leave Lucid \"Long Term Support\". They don't care about the changes that will mostly be invisible to them and they keep updating as update-manager instructs so I consider them \"current\". I've also replaced the Lucid \"pig vomit\" boot-screen/default background, so the most glaring defect of Lucid is already gone ;) \nFor vanilla machines like mine, I've found a single defect since Beta 1, and it was fixed the day after I reported it (not because of my report, it had already been uncovered). Helping to defray the network load on M-Day is a pretty good reason. It is unfortunate that dist-upgrade doesn't handle torrents - or even to take an idea from Blizzard - start torrenting the majority of the bits around a week in advance at low priority. \nOn the other hand, since the granularity of a Debian/Ubuntu upgrade is a package, even a single byte change induces one or more package upgrades; dist-upgrade is bandwidth and storage heavy and to preload for those who don't know what a Meerkat is would be wasteful.\n\nA: The best reason to install the release version is simply that that's what everyone else is doing.\nThere is value in being in the same boat as a large number of other people. Problems you have are likely to be experienced by other people, which increases the likelihood you'll be able to help each other and find a fix. This is one of the main advantages Ubuntu has over other distros today.\nOK, there's not going to be much of a real difference between a fresh release-version Maverick and one that was installed from Beta and upgraded to Release. But you'll always been slightly unsure. A year down the line when you try to do a dist-upgrade and the dependencies get wedged, did that happen because you chose a combination of packages or installed a driver during the Beta phase that then got in a weird state when Release updated them? Do you have a strange bunch of settings no-one else does because you installed before Release changed them? and so on.\n\nA: I've been using 10.10 since it hit beta, as I do for most Ubuntu releases.  With all the bells and whistles enabled (Compiz, Nvidia drivers, etc.) I've had virtually no trouble.  The only problems I encountered were months ago and they were minor.  Lucid was another story, but if you want 10.10 and are going to upgrade anyway (the home desktop version is the only one I can speak for) I say go for it!\n", "Q: How do I set up automatic login? How do I get 10.04 (Lucid) to log me in automatically on each reboot?\n\nA: You can find this option under System > Administration > Login Screen. \nYou'll need to \"unlock\" the window as this requires administrative privileges.\n\nYou can then select the user and session you would like logged in automatically.\n\n", "Q: Single mouse clicks behaving as double clicks? Some time ago I started experiencing strange issue when single clicks would intermittently act as double clicks. \nReplacing the mouse doesn't help. \nUbuntu forum seems to have few threads related to this( this, and this and few more) with no definitive solution.\nHence my question - maybe someone here will be able to help me solve this mystery?\n\nA: I've just found the bug report here. Bryce seems to suggest that it might be a Nvidia issue (that's how it has been filed since).\nBut yes, try another mouse. Try a different version of the nvidia driver (you can update to the x-swat PPA for the latest versions -- or install it manually) and if you're at your wits' end, splash out a monkey load of money on a £300 motherboard, £100 mouse and £150 SSD. If nothing else, it'll give you some retail therapy.\nThis effected me in 9.10 and I did my upgrade some time before moving to 10.04 so this could easily be completely unrelated.\n", "Q: I want my panel clock to be \"digital\" (2011-01-01).

The clock is handy for this.    \nCan the standard Ubuntu clock do this? I couldn't find anything.\n... or is there another clock which can?  \n\nA: Yes, you can do this with the standard Ubuntu clock. \nOpen the gconf-editor and navigate to apps -> panel -> applets -> clock_screen0 -> prefs. You can then set the key custom_format to any format you want, e.g. %Y-%m-%d %H.%M.%S should give the format you want. You also have to set the key named format to custom so that your custom format is used.\nThe custom format can also contain HTML formatting, so you could use something fancy like <b>%Y-%m-%d</b> %H.%M.<span color=”#888888″>%S</span> to display the date in bold and the seconds in grey...\n\nA: The GNOME Clock is actually very customizable once you dig into the gconf settings.\nLaunch gconf-editor from the terminal or the \"Run Application\" dialog (Alt-F2).\nNavigate to /apps/panel/applets/clock_screen0/prefs/custom_format\n\nTake a look at man strftime for the different variables you can use there.\nYou also need to set /apps/panel/applets/clock_screen0/prefs/format to custom for your changes to take effect.\n", "Q: How do you view the contents of a .CAB file?

I bought a bluetooth-dongle but I couldn't get it to work yet. I think I already set this up on an older version of Ubuntu on my laptop.\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.10, the phone is an android 2.2 (but I think this doesn't matter) and the bluetooth device is a Integrated System Solution Corp.

ATM I'm able to dial numbers in hfconsole - that's all. Somehow I'm shure there is a way to get this to work!\n\nA: I know that some bluetooth devices will not connect with a phone I used to have. There seems to be some incompatibilities between different BT devices, and there is not much that could be done there. So far, Bluetooth was more trouble that it was worth it. I also had issues with such keyboards that would always disconnect.\nI know this is not the answer you are looking for, but this might be a fact, and unless you can hac the Bluetooth connection, or change bluetooth-related internal settings, you may not be able to do anything.\n\nA: Bluetooth is a technology based around specifications and profiles.  According to the official Bluetooth site many features of the core specification are not required, but are optional.  Furthermore, product differentiation is furthered by the use of profiles.\nNot all devices support all profiles or are made to support them.  For example, my Motorola Rokr S9 headset supports the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), the Headset Profile, and the Hands-Free Profile.  The later two are used for telephone handsfree.\nWith that said, the first thing to determine is whether your phone and your headphone support the same Core Specification level (ie 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 4.0) and whether or not it supports the proper profiles.  To do so you would need to check with the documentation on the headset and/or with the manufacturer.\nIf the necessary Profiles or Core Spec is not met, then there is no way to use the computer headset with your mobile.\nOfficial Bluetooth Technology Info Site\n\nA: The nohands project seems to be abandoned, but that's no problem:\nIt jutst works out of the box with recent (19.10 here) Versions of Ubuntu.\nJust pair your computer with the smartphone and configure input and output sound devices accordingly (the default on my laptop was to use the smartphone as input and output which is exactly not what's useful for this scenario).

This is a silly, nitpicky little thing, but I have a laptop with a less-than-desirable amount of screen real estate, so it bothers me. I've added a bunch of application launchers to the default panel at the top of my screen (to the right of the Applications/Places/System menus.) The problem is, I can't seem to control the spacing of the icons - I have quite a bit of space available at the right of the panel, and I can drag each individual icon over, but it seems like each icon is attached to its neighbor to the right. So I move one over, and the next one comes with it. Then I move that one, and the one to it's left comes too. The end result is I have several clumps of very-closely-clustered icons, with a lot of space between each clump.\nIs there any way to control the spacing automatically? Snap to grid, auto-space, anything? Because my screen is tiny and resolution is pretty high, each icon is very small, and when they're so close together I sometimes end up clicking the wrong one.\nI'm running Lucid, and am open to installing things if there's a package that would give me more control over the presentation. I'm also relatively new to Linux, so maybe there's a setting I'm missing somewhere in one of the preferences menus.\n\nA: Some of the Gnome panel icons, such as the indicator icon actually consist of several pieces that are attached. The process iIuse to set things up as I like is to right-click on all each of the icons to make sure it is not set to 'lock to panel'. After they're all unlocked, move a few of the icons out of the way on the side that you want to start positioning them on my right-clicking and selecting the 'move' menu option on them. Then, use the same process to move each icon into position in the right order, and with the amount of spacing you prefer. After you've got everything as you want it, set the 'lock to panel' on all of the icons.\nI realize this is a manual process, but with the variable width of some of the icons I'm not sure it can be automated well.\n\nA: You might be happier giving avant window navigator a try instead of the gnome panel for your launchers.  I believe the setting to expand to fill a side spaces out the icons like you want.\n\nA: I would agree with the first answer suggesting you use Avant-Window-Navigator as a replacement for your gnome-panel. AWN can be set up to look just like the gnome-panel and it now supports enough functions to be a complete replacement (e.g., gnomenu and other main menus, ubuntu indicator menus, gnome notification area, etc.). But it organizes your icons much, much better. Docky is, of course, more slick as far as dock visuals go (imho), but it still lacks some of the panel features (like good indicator support). Another nice feature (if visuals are important to you) is that AWN will space the notification area icons and the indicator-menu icons the same way. On the gnome-panel the notification icons always look bunched together too.\n\nA: I can feel you on this one, it's bugged me quite frequently too. I'd say it's not really that nitpicky a thing. Arranging icons in a neat order - vista does it, XFCE does it, hell I think windows XP did it. Why not GNOME?\nBut: so:\nThe semi-solution I have found:\n1. Gather all the icons / shortcuts that you want to be displayed on your desktop.\n2. Cut and paste all these icons in a different folder. ie, /home/emmy/icons\n3. Cut and paste these back onto your desktop.\nGnome should evenly space these out now.\nIf there's a certain order in which you want your icons listed, (aside from alphabetical order), you'll simply have to cut and paste back to desktop in chunks, in the order desired.\nMake sense?\nIt's a hack solution, but gnome/nautilus does not/will not organize icons properly, as far as I know, and as long as you don't change the shorcuts around constantly you only have to do it once.\nIf you find a real solution to this, I would love to hear it!\n", "Q: How to reach a Windows machine by hostname?

It mixes up messages from May this year and recent messages from the last few days.\nHow can I remove the old messages from May?\n\nA: The packages logrotate and rsyslog together will set up your system for automatic archiving and aging the syslog files.\nThere are plenty of options to the logrotate(8) command that will help you truncate the current mess and then the rest should happen automatically.\n\nA: \nHow can I remove the old messages from May?\n\nThere are two ways.

I'm used to this Windows behavior that using CTRL+SHIFT+Cursor Keys I can select text word-wise. CTRL+Cursor Keys jumps word-wise and I use that a lot in combination with SHIFT to select text.\nThis seems to be a \"Windows thing\" because it just works in all application. Now turning to Ubuntu 10.04, it doesn't work. CTRL+SHIFT+Cursor Keys just behaves like CTRL+Cursor Keys, i.e. I jump between the words but I can't select them that way.\nAnother gotcha: I use CTRL+Cursor Keys to move fast between words, press down SHIFT, release CTRL and move the Cursor Keys to select text char by char and it doesn't work either. I need to release both keys complete.\nIs there a way to enable this?\n\nA: Found the problem: in Windows I use multiple keyboard layouts and I use CTRL+SHIFT to switch between them. I configured the same for Ubuntu however I'm experiencing a clash here obviously.\nThat said, Windows is smarty enough to figure out by analyzing which keys I press over time what I want. Ubuntu isn't: once I pressed CTRL+SHIFT, not matter what additional keys, it switched the keyboard layout and for some reason this interrupted the selection option. Too bad.\n\nA: I have the same problem.

It's similar to the registry in that it's a centralized location for applications to store configuration information. Some apps abuse it and put data in there.\ngconf-editor is just an application that shows you the keys and the values, it's not meant to be an end user tool.

I have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal (Applications, Accessories, Terminal) and type \"sudo apt-get install wine.\" This installs Wine Windows Emulator, a free application that allows you to run many Windows programs within Linux.\n\n*Download Windows Media Player 11 for Windows XP (link in Resources) and save it to Ubuntu's desktop. Once downloaded, right-click and select \"Open with Wine Windows Emulator.\" Follow the on-screen prompts for installing it to your system.\n\n*Go to \"Applications\" then \"Wine,\" select \"Programs\" and open \"Windows Media Player.\" Click \"File\" then \"Open\" and locate a DRM file you want to play. Select \"OK\" to load it into Media Player.\nI installed Wine (Which is step 1).\nBut I am having problems with step 2 (Download Windows Media Player 11 for Windows XP (link in Resources) and save it to Ubuntu's desktop). I'm just not finding a way to do it. \nI may be overlooking the (link in Resources) Can't find it. \nI am stuck!\n\nA: This is a Half-Answer. I say half since you will not be able to visualize the theme of WMP11 but you will be able to play music and videos (Videos in this case only in fullcreen). If this is something you think solves the problem then accept, if not (Most likely will not since it is a weird way of installing it) then feel free to comment on it.\n(Tested on my PC a laptop and in a last sorry excuse for PC just to make sure the procedure can repeat itself)\nSteps to install Windows Media Player:\nPre-Requesites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have Wine 1.3.33+\n\n*Have winecfg opened all the time since you will be using it a lot.\n\n*Configure winecfg in the video tab to a virtual window. In my case I set this at 1024x768.\n\n*Configure winecfg to use Windows 2003\n\n*No need to configure any libraries\n\n*Pray to the Flying Spaghetti Monster and let yourself be touched by his noodly appendage\n\n\nAfter all that is made (I also have PlayOnLinux installed. I mention it just in case POL installed something in Wine and I did not notice or didn't tell me about it ^^) we can proceed with WMP11:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the WMP11 version for Windows XP (I only tested this one. It is about 25MB)  \n\n*Having winecfg already opened and configure to emulate a virtual desktop of at least 1024x768 (So to not use fullscreen) open a terminal in Ubuntu (Outside wine) and go where the WMP11 executable is.\n\n*Run wine wmp11-windowsxp-x86-enu.exe where the downloaded installer is. At this point winecfg should be configure in Windows 2003 mode. You will get the welcome screen, click on validate and wait for it. In Windows 2003 mode it will skip validation and go to the EULA. DO NOT ACCEPT THE EULA YET!.\n\n*Go to the winecfg window (which both should be sharing, winecfg and WMP11) and change the system from Windows 2003 to XP. Save it but don't close winecfg yet.\n\n*Continue with the installation of WMP11.\n\n*You have a chance of finishing the installation with no problem, but if it hangs (Which probably will) in 25%, 50%, 75% do not worry. Just go to the terminal that you used wine to execute wmp11 and press CTRL+C. After that, just in case type wineserver -k to kill any remaining wine related processes.\n\n*Repeat steps 3 through 5 until the installation finishes completely remembering that to start WMP11 you need to have winecfg configured to Windows 2003 and after the validation, change it back to Windows XP to continue the installation.\n\n*Assuming you got to the end of the installation it will ALWAYS say \"You have failed!. The installation went wrong and did not survive. Kitties will die\". Do not worry about the \"did not complete part\" at the end of the installation. It actually finished. At least looking from a functionality perspective.\n\n*Go to the WMP11 folder inside the wine directory where the installer \"installed\" the WMP folder. Setup winecfg for Windows XP and run wmplayer.exe (You can run it from Nautilus). In my case it is in /home/cyrex/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Windows Media Player. Remember to not close winecfg since we are not done yet with it.\n\n*WMP11 will open but it will be horrible as seen here:\n\nPress Enter 4 or 5 times to accept something that you can not see. I do not remember how many. Just do 5 and that should be enough.\n\n*Again, close WMP11. run wineserver -k just to make sure.\n\n*Change winecfg from Windows XP to Windows 7.\n\n*Open wmplayer.exe again. This time you should see a little bit more stuff like here:\n\n\n*And one last time, close WMP11. run wineserver -k and change winecfg from Windows 7 to FINALLY Windows XP where it will remain. NOW you can close winecfg.\nThat is all. The option to run WMP11 can be found in the Open With option when right clicking in Nautilus, as seen here:\n\nYou can hear music, add mp3 lists and hear all songs from the list as shown here:\n\nLastly you CAN see a movie but you need to make it fullscreen to see it. Just press ALT+ENTER for fullscreen. The menu below while fullscreen will not work, instead just right click the video and the context menu should help. As shown here:\n\n\nA: The only link I can find at the moment is through Microsoft. Unfortunately it requires you jump through the Windows Genuine Advantage nonsense so you either need a legit XP machine nearby (a VirtualBox install should do) or Google skills I don't have to find an alternative.\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=1d224714-e238-4e45-8668-5166114010ca\nEven then, you have a fight with Wine ahead of you. Depending on the power of your computer, it may well just be simpler to run XP in VirtualBox when you want to play encrypted WMV video. \nIf you have a powerful computer and you spend some time stripping XP down (through nlite, etc) as I have, it shouldn't take more than a few seconds to boot.\n\nA: According to http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10219  the Installer for WMP 11 does not try to test WGA if the Windows version is set to Vista.  You can check this in winecfg (Applications->Configure Wine).  The latest test results show that there might be problems installing this way, but those test results are rather old -- I suggest trying the latest wine1.3 package in the PPA if you run into problems.\nThere are also some other possible workarounds in the bug report there.\n\nA: According to WineDB Windows Media Player 11 cannot run properly using wine.\nIt has been rated as garbage meaning that even if you can make it run it will not be stable / usable.\nHas an alternative I recommend you use Windows Media Player 10 which should install and work (with limited abilities) using wine.\nYou can download Windows Media Player 10 directly from Microsoft here.\n\nA: Try this...\nGo to Frostwire, type in Windows Media Player 11 (or 10, or 12.....). \n\n\n*\n\n*Download one of the search results..an .exe file, (or .zip or .rar file if you like doing things the hard way). \n\n*When the download is finished, locate the downloaded .exe file\n\n*right click and choose \"open with wine program loader\". \n\n*Follow the prompts, and install WMP.\n\n*Finished. Maybe 6 or 8 mouse clicks, no typing and no knowledge required.\n\n\nWorks for me.\nOf course, WHY anybody would want to use WMP is beyond me, but it does work.\n", "Q: GRUB Help and Reinstalling Ubuntu Recently, I installed Ubuntu 10 Netbook edition (on my netbook, yes, obvious).

If you want to try fixing\nyour existing install, I would try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from live CD or USB stick (the Ubuntu Wiki has instructions on how to prepare a bootable installation USB stick)\n\n*Re-install GRUB; some instructions are available in this post.\nHowever, if you don't have any valuable data on the disk, it may just\nbe simpler to reinstall: just use the Ubuntu Live CD or a bootable\nUSB key,\nwipe out your existing Linux partitions (using the \"Manual\npartitioning scheme\" in the installation; you can also let the installer\n\"Use whole disk for Ubuntu\" if you don't have Windows or other OSes on\nthe disk), and then proceeed installing as usual.\n", "Q: How to install tmux from source?

In the tmux webpage they say that it depends on libevent and ncurses. So this command will likely install all that you need (not tested):\nsudo apt-get install libevent-1.4 libevent-dev libncurses5-dev\n\nBut if you need to ask this you shouldn't probably be compiling things from source, unless you are doing it to learn, just for fun or just having a terrible day ;).\n", "Q: Upgrading to latest stable Mono Mono 2.8 was recently released boasting a couple of large performance improvements.

Drag the window all the way to the left (or right depending on your setup) with the majority of the window off the screen.  Grab the visible edge of the window and stretch it out across both monitors.  Leave as much empty space as you dragged off screen.  Now drag it back so it's fully on both screens.  It seems like at least half the window must be off the screen for this trick to work.\n\nA: This may be a simplistic suggestion (and you've probably thought of it), but can you just drag the emacs window so that it overlaps both screens and then drag-resize the window to the outside edges of your screens? You would have to keep it in windowed mode, of course (i.e., not maximized).\n", "Q: Problem changing resolution using xrandr: BadMatch I tried to change the resolution using the following commands (found here):\nUse xrandr to check the current configuration and available modes:\n$ xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 64 x 64, current 800 x 600, maximum 32000 x 32000\nVBOX1 connected 800x600+0+0 0mm x 0mm\n   800x600        60.0*+\n   640x480        59.9  \n\nUse cvt to get the proper modeline for 1280x800:\n$ cvt 1280 800\n# 1280x800 59.81 Hz (CVT 1.02MA) hsync: 49.70 kHz; pclk: 83.50 MHz\nModeline \"1280x800_60.00\"   83.50  1280 1352 1480 1680  800 803 809 831 -hsync +vsync\n\nCreate the new mode using xrandr --newmode:\n$ xrandr --newmode \"1280x800_60.00\"   83.50  1280 1352 1480 1680  800 803 809 831 -hsync +vsync\n\nUse xrandr again to check that the mode was created successfully:\n$ xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 64 x 64, current 800 x 600, maximum 32000 x 32000\nVBOX1 connected 800x600+0+0 0mm x 0mm\n   800x600        60.0*+\n   640x480        59.9  \n  1280x800_60.00 (0x11a)   83.0MHz\n        h: width  1280 start 1352 end 1480 total 1680 skew    0 clock   49.4KHz\n        v: height  800 start  803 end  809 total  831           clock   59.5Hz\n\nHowever, when I try to add the new mode to the display with xrandr --addmode I get the following error:\n$ xrandr --addmode VBOX1 1280x800_60.00\nX Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  150 (RANDR)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  18 (RRAddOutputMode)\n  Serial number of failed request:  18\n  Current serial number in output stream:  19\n\nOf course, if I try to set the new resolution for my current display it fails (the mode isn't associated to te display):\n$ xrandr --output VBOX1 --mode 1280x800_60.00\nxrandr: cannot find mode 1280x800_60.00\n\n\nA: Seems that you're trying within VirtualBox.

Double check your hardware, try rebooting of course and check alsamixer. You can just type in \"alsamixer\" in the terminal and check all the settings.

(...if either)\nIs this related to the Trash?\nPS. It is the only partition, and is using the entire drive space.\n\nA: There are different ways of counting space on a filesystem ranging from bytes not in use to free clusters, etc. In the absence of better information, I'd take gparted's report as more \"accurate\".\nFilesystems require overhead for i-tables, free lists, superblocks, superblock backups, and - in ext4 - journaling. Your reported 4.86 out of 298GB is a whopping 1.6% overhead in order to keep track of your stuffs; that strikes me as pretty low overhead.\n\nA: Gparted, that use mkfs.ext4 to create a ext4 filesystem, reserves 5% of the space for super-user, as explained in man page:\n-m reserved-blocks-percentage\n   Specify  the  percentage  of the filesystem blocks reserved for the super-user.  This \n   avoids fragmentation, and allows root-owned daemons, such as syslogd(8), to continue to \n   function correctly after non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the \n   filesystem.  The default percentage is 5%.\n\nNow, 5% of about 300GB is just the 15GB you see already used.\nMore interesting, you can avoid this if you feel do not need it, simply creating the filesystem with, for example, \nsudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 /dev/sda1\n\nwhere 0 means 0%.\nI think Gparted see more space because is run by super-user, so part of that 15GB are free for him. Nautilus is run by the user, so the space is less.\n\nA: Aside from the space reserved for root, see my other answer here.  The short of it is that the ext series of filesystems reserves space for the inode tables at format time, which with the default settings, amounts to 2 mb for every 128 mb of disk space.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard command for 'show desktop'? Like Windows, I want to hit Super+D to jump to the desktop or minimize all windows. I don't see command like that in Keyboard Shortcuts. Any idea?\n\nA: By default, it's set to Ctrl+Alt+D. You can set your own shortcut by going to System → Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts and changing \"Hide all normal windows and set focus to the desktop\" located under \"window management\":\n\n\nA: I tried both Super+d and Ctrl+Alt+d to see the default for Ubuntu 14.04 and neither worked.

You can then edit the options for your panel(s) by clicking on the folders in the tree view below the toplevels folder. Untick the 'auto_hide' option. It might help if you increase the number of pixels shown when the panel is hidden by editing the auto_hide_size option.\nIf you want to reset the panels to their original state see: Resetting gnome panel\n", "Q: How do I dual boot Windows XP and Ubuntu? I already have Ubuntu installed on the machine and a spare NTFS partition.\n\nA: If you just install Windows onto your new machine it will overwrite your bootloader, so you won't be able to boot into Ubuntu anymore. Generally it's better to first install Windows and then Ubuntu, as Ubuntu recognizes your Windows Installation and creates a Grub-Entry to start it.\nHowever, this way around works too.\nYou will need some sort of Live-CD (Like the Ubuntu Install-CD). Boot it.\nMount your Ubuntu partition:\n(REPLACE X and Y)\n\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX\n\nNow restart your computer.

For example, let's say I put max priority for the browser (or http) and then, no matter how much bandwidth was using at the time, the http packets would always go through. \nIs this possible?  Is there an application for Ubuntu to do this or a way to configure this on Ubuntu directly?\n\nA: Wondershaper\nIf it's not too simple for your use case I suggest you give wondershaper a try.\n\nAn easy to use traffic shaping script\n  that provides these improvements:   *\n  Low latency for interactive traffic\n  (and pings) at all times   * Allow\n  websurfing at reasonable speeds while\n  uploading / downloading   * Make sure\n  uploads don't hurt downloads   * Make\n  sure downloads don't hurt uploads  . \n  It does this by:   * Limiting upload\n  speed slightly, to eliminate queues\n  * Limiting download speed, while allowing bursts, to eliminate queues\n  * Interactive traffic skips the queue   * ACKs and tiny packets skip the queue\n\nIt's available as a debian/ubuntu package, just run sudo apt-get install wondershaper to install it.

I've not used it myself, but the screenshot below should give you an idea:\n\n\nA: This is called bandwidth management, which on Ubuntu is done through the tc command.  More info here, but it is not for the faint of heart.  \n\nA: This is a well-known problem, and as far as I know there is no easy answer.\nThe general problem is called QoS, short for Quality of Service. At the level of the networking infrastructure, what you can do is traffic shaping.\nThere is a fundamental limitation of traffic shaping for your use case (which is a very common one): you need to act at the point of entry to the bottleneck, not at the point of exit. But typically the bottleneck is the connection between your home/workplace to your ISP's infrastructure, and you can't control what happens at your ISP's, so you can only shape upload, not download. This means you can effectively prioritize web browsing over bittorrent, but not (say) streaming content over background downloads.\nIf you have a home router and it supports QoS/shaping/whatever-it-calls-it, its interface is likely to be easier to use than what Ubuntu can offer. So look there first. But this is an advanced feature not found in all routers.\nMost bittorrent clients should be able to limit bandwidth usage. If you have less upload than download bandwidth (which is typical for home users over DSL), setting the limit to 70%–80% of your bandwidth should leave room for comfortable web browsing.\n\nA: Trickle\nWith the trickled daemon, you can set the bandwidth distribution of your processes using priorities according to a configuration file in /etc/trickled.conf.

In your ~/.bashrc, add the following line at the very end:\nhistory -s \"$BASH_INITIAL_COMMAND\"\n\nRun gnome-terminal -x env BASH_INITIAL_COMMAND='my text to be posted' bash, and press Up at the prompt to recall the text.\nNote also that if you put set -o history followed by comments at the end of your .bashrc, they will be entered into the history as bash starts, so you can use them as a basis for editing by reaching them with the Up key and removing the initial #.\n\nA: You can do this with expect (install). Create and make executable ~/bin/myprompt:\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\n\n# Get a Bash shell\nspawn -noecho bash\n\n# Wait for a prompt\nexpect \"$ \"\n\n# Type something\nsend \"my text to be posted\"\n\n# Hand over control to the user\ninteract\n\nexit\n\nand run Gnome Terminal with:\ngnome-terminal -e ~/bin/myprompt\n\n\nA: ændrük's answer is fine, but perhaps a little heavyweight for the task.\nHere is a script that writes a script based on its arguments\n#!/bin/sh\n# terminal-plus-command: start a subordinate terminal which runs\n# the interactive shell after first running the command arguments\n\ntmpscript=/tmp/tmpscript.$$\necho \"#!$SHELL\" > $tmpscript\necho \"$@\" >> $tmpscript\necho exec \"$SHELL\" >> $tmpscript\nchmod +x $tmpscript\ngnome-terminal --command $tmpscript\nrm -f $tmpscript\n\nIf you've not done much shell programming, there appears to be more magic here than there is. First, I name a temporary file for holding the script where $$ is the process ID of the shell running this script. The /tmp/something.$$ metaphor is used in case two instances of this script are run at the same time, they won't try to use the same temporary file.\nThe variable $SHELL is set to the name of the shell running the script. If you use /usr/bin/bash, presumably you'd like the mini-script to use it also. \nThe \"$@\" is a shell idiom for \"interpolate all my arguments, quoting them if needed\". This peculiar syntax causes\nscript.sh 'my file' your\\ file\n\nto interpolate the arguments as two elements\n\"my file\" \"your file\"\n\ninstead of the four that $@ would yield\n\"my\" \"file\" \"your\" \"file\"\n\nThe last lines of the script arrange for a gnome-terminal to start running the mini-script and then starting an interactive shell. When the gnome-terminal exits, the temporary script is removed because littering is uncool.\nThe last line is not a part of the mini-script, it demonstrates that the mini-script works. If the 11 line script above is in a file called rt.sh then the chmod makes it executable and then it is executed.\n$ chmod +x rt.sh && ./rt.sh echo hello world\n\nThe result of all of this will be a gnome terminal which starts up, displays\nhello world\n\non its first line and then starts an interactive shell:\nmsw@myhost:~$\n\n\nA: The two answers I've liked best to solve this are using expect and this one where they recommend using the --init-file flag either in the shebang or when executing the terminal:\n#!/bin/bash --init-file\ncommands to run\n\n... and execute it as:\nxterm -e /path/to/script\n# or\ngnome-terminal -e /path/to/script\n# or\nthe-terminal -e bash --init-file /path/to/script/with/no/shebang\n\nexpect is probably the better solution (for reasons I'll outline), except that I cannot control whether it's installed in my target environment.\nThe problem I ran into with bash's --init-file and gnome-terminal's --command as a hack to solve this is the shell doesn't have access to STDIN while executing init scripts.  If, for example, I want to run something that would require user input (ftp, telnet, etc) but leave the parent shell running afterward it won't work; the only exception I've seen to this so far is ssh:\nxterm -e /bin/bash --init-file <(echo 'ssh -X some-machine')\n\n... but what I need is more complicated than this toy example.  Anyway, I hope the --init-file stuff is useful to anyone reading this question.\n\nA: To start in interactive bash inside a gnome-terminal with some commands already executed I put those commands in a setup file and dynamically append the contents to my .bashrc file:\n# my_startup_script.sh\nexport FOO=bar\necho \"hello world\"\n\ngnome-terminal --tab -- bash -c \"bash --rcfile <(cat ${HOME}/.bashrc my_startup_script.sh; )\"\n=> \nhello world\n$ echo $FOO\nbar\n\n\nA: You can use the -e or -x arguments to run a command inside a newly popped up terminal, but that's not exactly what you want.\n", "Q: Why can't RhythmBox/Coherence see PS3 Media Server? By PS3 Media server, I mean the package, rather than an actual PS3. It's a uPnp server. My XBox can see it and stream from it, but the Coherence plug-in of RhythmBox does not seem to be able to. I suspect it may need a new renderer configuration. Has anyone run into this problem and resolved it? I also had the same problem with x360mediaserver, a similar server side package.\n\nA: You may be seeing something that I am seeing, albeit from a different source (see question here). I was not able to see a uPnP share on my Win7 box with 10.04, but I was able to get it slightly working once with 10.10.\nI have a large music share, and I am thinking that the uPnP plugin just isn't that efficient or fully baked to handle it.\nI would try 10.10 and maybe your luck will be better.\n\nA: Assuming that you properly installed FFMpeg and VLC on your system, I would go into the PS3 media server encoding properties and make VLC encoder the default encoder for both audio and video for \"streaming\".   This means you move VLC to the top of the list in each category in the configuration user interface.   Not sure if that will help you but it is worth a try or at least to double-check .     I had some problems with my initial configuration because I had VLC as the default video streamer and MPlayer the default for audio.   My Google TV didn't like that (when streaming from Ubuntu 10.10).\n", "Q: How To Enable Compcache? Compcache is a form of compressed ram swap that should improve performance in some circumstances for memory starved machines.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/compcache/\nApparently Ubuntu has had this available for a bit now, and I attempted to enable it, and found this post:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=6609064&postcount=10\nWhat other steps do I have to take to enable compcache on Ubuntu, or is that it?\n\nA: Compcache is deprecated in favor of zRam since Natty. I recommend using zramwap instead, it has an install-a-package setup process and comes with sane defaults that automatically adapt to your system specs.\n\nA: According to the Ubuntu wiki entry on Compcache, I think that's it. But in another post in the thread you linked to, a user suggests tweaking the setting. Also, as you can see here, there's a way to set an upper limit to the memory used by a temporary file system.\n", "Q: Why is the version of libatlas on Ubuntu so old? The versions of libatlas available on Debian and/or Fedora are much more up to date (as in more than a year if not two newer) than those I see in the Ubuntu repositories.\n\n*\n\n*Why that is?\n\n*Is it possible (advised?) to bypass the Ubuntu repos and use the packages from the Debian reps (and run into dependency hell)? Or is there a fundamental reasons why libatlas is stuck at 3.6.X in Ubuntu?\n\n\nA: libatlas in Ubuntu 10.10 is at upstream version 3.8.3, the same as in Debian and Fedora. See:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/libatlas-base-dev\nYour best bet is to upgrade to 10.10 (which will be released in two days at the time of this post). Backporting lib packages from Debian or Ubuntu development releases can be a tricky proposition as you would likely have to rebuild any of libatlas' reverse dependencies against the new version as well.\n\nA: libatlas is in the Universe repository. According to the Ubuntu Help:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Universe - Community maintained software, i.e. not officially supported software.\n  \n\nThis software may not be high priority for the maintainer. You should file a bug or ask a question to the libatlas maintainer, and see if they will consider upgrading the package.\nIt appears that Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) will include ATLAS 3.8.3-22ubuntu2 . Ubuntu 10.10 will be released this month, although you should consider waiting a few weeks or more to let others shake out the bugs in 10.10.\nYou also might be better off installing ATLAS from source, instead of relying on the Debian or Ubuntu maintainers. \n", "Q: Main Menu keyboard navigation does not restart at the first typed letter. Is this a bug or a tweakable feature? Skip this section, unless you want to read some really boring background.  \n\nI often prefer to navigate via the keyboard, and I typically launch my most frequently used apps via a system-wide hot-key.  \nFor less frequtnely used ones I had developed my own quirky menu-navigation system (in Windows, where I've spent the last 20 years).  \nIt relies on the principle of \"jump to the next item in the list which matches the letter/character I've just typed\"... I am only referring to first-letter/character.  \nI created a folder called ` (ie. a single back-tick)\nIn this folder was a simple list of my \"secondary\" apps... with one minor difference.\nEach of these was prefixed with with either `,  ~,  or !\nAll these keys are conveniently located near the menu-launch key (Win-key, or Alt-F1)\n... I have my Main Menu popping up (like Windows)  \nThis enables me to start any of my secondary apps with a simple consistancy; even blindfolded.  \nAside from a minor difference in how Ubuntu/(Gnome) submenus must be specifically naviated into (...wheras Windows automatically moves the focus into the sub-menu)... I have this same system working in Ubuntu.\nI love the way Ubuntu(Linux) is so configurable!  \nBut! (such a small word)... there is a problem.  \n\nFor some unknown reason, the \"jump to next item starting with **letter/character**\" feature behaves oddly in the Gnome menu.\nIs it a bug, Is it a feature, Is it tweakable? .... I don't know, but this is how it (mis-)behaves:  \nIt remembers the most recently accessed item of a letter/character group.. even across seperate open/close cycles of the menu...  \nThis beaks the do-it-blindfolded consistancy which is why I use this first-letter method. \nDoes anyone know if this is tweakable?  so that each new access to a menu-list causes the \"first-item\" to be the topmost item (within that first letter/character group), and not the next one on from a previous Menu session...\n\nA: First, sorry for not quite answering your question, but it seems to me that there are other solutions that may fit your bill...\nFrom what I gather, you want to quickly launch applications from the keyboard and you'd like to retain the \"muscle memory\" you acquired from the windows days :) \nThere are a couple of fantastic apps that do fulfill your first requirement, but may somewhat fail the second. However, from personal experience, after using these for a while I feel seriously handicapped on any computer without them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome-do (http://do.davebsd.com/) similar to Quicksilver on Mac OSX. Hit Win+Space and a window pops up that lets you type the first letters of any program installed, and then lauches it. Gnome-do is smart, so it learns your habits. It also has a large number of plugins -- it can post stuff on twitter, search the net etc..\n\n*Cardapio (https://launchpad.net/cardapio) a main menu replacement, which includes similar functionality as gnome-do -- quick search of apps etc (I think it's also similar to the start menu in Win 7).\n", "Q: how to restart java/flash from command line? The java/flash plugin support in the browsers seems a little iffy (not to mention hard to configure.)  My specific question is, is it possible to kill the flash/java PID and restart the process? Anyone know how to ID these plugin processes? I've closed out the browser and reopened, it doesn't seem to die with them. Is flash persistent?\n\nA: Flash typically isn't persistent but can hang. For Chrome and Firefox (at least) the Flash plugin runs under the following guise (If you're using flashplayer-nonfree):\n/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer.bin --plugin /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so --connection /org/wrapper/NSPlugins/libflashplayer.so/30310-2\nTo find the pid you could simply run the following from the command line:\nps -aef | grep flashplayer\nThis should produce an eight columned list. The second and third columns are the pid and parent pid (respectively) so you should be able to just run kill <pid> replacing the bracketed pid with the numerical PID.\nAs for restarting the flashplayer plugin it should automatically start up again on the next invocation (or refresh) of a page requiring flash.\n\nA: I generally get rid of poorly behaved flash processes with 'killall npviewer.bin'. It will usually reload with a refresh.\n", "Q: PostgreSQL missing /etc/postgresql folder? I have a fresh installation of Ubuntu 10.10 (amd64).\nEven though the Postgresql (8.4.5) server and client are installed, the postgresql directory in /etc folder is missing.\nAny clues what could be cause of this problem.\n\nA: The solution was to reinstall after purging the packages.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge postgresql-8.4\nthen\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-8.4\n", "Q: Future of Bazaar The Bazaar DVCS seems to be left far behind Git and Mercurial, at least in terms of adoption and overall mindshare in the VCS space. AFAIK the only high profile projects using bzr are \nUbuntu and Launchpad, both directly backed by Canonical. So I'm wondering, would it make sense for Canonical to switch to one of the other two leading contenders instead of keep allocating resources to it ? Is there any strategic advantage, technical or otherwise, in pushing Bazaar at this time and age ? \n\nA: I don't use Bazaar, but when I have to - however, in the spirit of open source bazaar fits the bill. In the viewpoint of Canonical, Git and other source control tools didn't cut it for them so they produced Bazaar which suites their needs to a T. Would I like them to switch to another VCS? Sure, but it's not likely to happen - preferred source control tools are always opinionated by design and none of them are perfect.\nBazaar has plenty of projects using it - Launchpad is not just one project, it's a collection of many projects - many of which utilize Bazaar as their source control.\nPersonally I don't like Bazaar - so for the projects I interact with I export the bazaar repository to Git then import my changes back in. The majority of all modern DVCS are inter-compatible to some extent (and most are compatible with SVN and other CVCS). So in the end each project will use what is best for it's team. Each developer will use whatever is best for them.\n\nA: Sometimes, I find what VCS people use pushes away developers from contributing for small fixes since they aren't familiar with the particular VCS. It may not be true, but it has happened to be multiple times, where I want to contribute, but dont want to go through the hassle of trying to setup and use a new VCS. They would definitely be helped if they were to switch to a more widely used VCS, but if the one they are currently using fulfills all their needs i dont see them switching.\n:)\n", "Q: Ubuntu and Windows Server 2008 NFS Background \nI am trying to configure NFS on my Windows Server 2008 with UNIX Extensions to be able to connect to Ubuntu. However in 2008 you need AD to activate User Profile Mappings. Windows can however connect to a Identity Manager Service to retrieve this information from another machine. The reason for not running AD is that the server and setup is on a home network, and therefore AD is completely unnecessary.\nThe Question\nHow and can I configure my Ubuntu machine to provide a User Profile Mapping service, and what/how would I go about setting it up on my Ubuntu machine? I need to be able to map my Windows Users to my Linux users without require AD.\nThe problem with using OpenLDAP is that it doesn't support Server 2008 and also I am not sharing anything from Ubuntu. Also NFS can see the shares on the Server however can't connect to them in anyway.\nCurrent Setup\nI am running Ubuntu 10.10 without any GUI. It is a headless installation mainly used to run service type software and to do some network monitoring. It does not have any shares on the box, however connects to shares on the Windows Server 2008 machine using CIFS and FSTAB mounts. However I would like to switch to NFS because symlinks won't work when running RSYNC to backup the Ubuntu box for example.\n\nA: I don't know what is User Profile Mappings but I can suggest this new NFS 4.1 driver to provide NFS shares on Windows:\nhttp://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/nfsv4/windows/readme.html\n\nA: I believe you're looking to set up a Windows domain controller on Ubuntu, which you can do with a combo of OpenLDAP and Samba.\nHere's a very thorough guide:\nhttp://download.gna.org/smbldap-tools/docs/samba-ldap-howto/\n", "Q: Which tool to backup an ext4 partition? I'm searching for a tool to backup a whole ext4 partition to an image. I tried the latest version of mondo, which is not working. What are good alternatives?\n\nA: Modern versions of e2image (1.42.7 or later) allow efficient cloning/backing up of Ext2/3/4 partitions from the command line.\ne2image -ar /dev/sdaX ~/sdaX.img\n\n\n*\n\n*-a ensures that file data, and not just the filesystem structure, is copied.\n\n\n*-r ensures that the data is stored in a raw image format (like you would get with dd), as opposed to QEMU's QCOW2 format.\nThe resulting image will be efficient in terms of disk space usage, because:\n\n*\n\n*e2image will not copy blocks that are not in use by existing files\n\n*when outputting to an image file, it will store it as a sparse file, so that large blocks of zeroes will not take up any space on the disk.\n\nCare still needs to be taken when copying sparse files, to ensure that the zeroes aren't written out when copied.\nOne way to avoid this is to store the image file inside a squashfs image.  This is a read-only, mountable filesystem that compresses the data inside, but still allows the image file within to be seekable and mountable.\n\nA: Try Clonezilla. It runs in a liveCD environment, and supports any sort of partition (including ext4), to a variety of stores (NFS, SMB, SSH, local filesystems). \nI use it all the time to image workstations in our labs. \n\nA: dump and restore for ext4 (sudo apt-get install dump) were just designed for that matter.  Check this if you are curious:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/a/41445\n\nA: I like dd\n\ndd if=/dev/sda1 (or just sda for the whole disk) of=/home/user/backup.img\n\nand \n\ndd if=/home/user/backup.img of=/dev/sda1\n\nto get it back\n\nA: 'Disks' (gnome-disk-utility) is default in Ubuntu these days.\n\n\nA: Take a look at fsarchiver\nIt can be found on the latest SystemRescueCD\nReportedly made by the same guy who authored partimage.\nIt sports a lot of improvements including:\n - ext4 support\n - ntfs support\n - file-level instead of block-level\n - compression using multiple cores\nBasically, after a partition is saved/compressed it can be restored to different size partitions, and partitions of different formats (so you can use it to convert a partition's format too), and if part of the backup gets corrupted it doesn't destroy the whole image (like it would on a block-level backup.\nThe only downside (if you consider it a downside) is, it's only a command line app at the moment (but it should get a gui eventually).\n\nThe command line entries are really simple.\nTo save a partition:\nfsarchiver savefs /mnt/backup/gentoo-rootfs.fsa /dev/sda1\n\nWhere '/mnt/backup/gentoo-rootfs.fsa' is the path being saved to and '/dev/sda1' is the partition being cloned.\nTo restore a partition:\nfsarchiver restfs /mnt/backup/gentoo-rootfs.fsa id=0,dest=/dev/sda1\n\nJust reverse the options above. From what I understand (in the documentation), it looks like the id=0 is necessary because an image can contain multiple partitions. For more directions on usage (such as saving multiple partitions) checkout the QuickStart guide.\nSideNote: \nAs it turns out, I'm actually writing this (as entertainment) from a Linux Mint LiveCD while I'm cloning a newly updated windows factory install clone. I scoured the net earlier looking for a better partition cloning alternative because I want to finally trash this Ghose '03 disc that I've been using for years. I'll drop a note to let you know how it went after I finish the restore.\nUpdate:\nJust finished the backup with no errors. It took a little while because I didn't know about the options to make it multi-threaded when I started. The compression was set to the default value (equivalent to gzip -6), the partition was 4.48GB on disk (highly trimmed/updated XP + Chrome) and the output file weighs in at 2.3GB. No complaints here.\n\nA: Why do you want to create an image? In most cases a file based backup (like a tar ball) gives you much more flexibility when restoring it, e.g. you can restore it on a different file system or even multiple file systems.\n\nA: In addition to the filebased strategy: try the command rsync to backup your data.\nA program similar to this is called Déjà Dup: https://launchpad.net/deja-dup\n", "Q: How do I install Nautilus-Elementary?

I use krusader for file management stuff. the problem is that apache's DocumentRoot should be under chown www-data:www-data /path/to/www. so using krusader (which is run under my account) I've not write access to /path/to/www while I really need. I don't know how other developers can continue doing things with such a restriction!\nI wondered if I could run krusader as www-data then I will be able to easily play with files. but using su - www-data asked me for www-data's password!!\nSo, how can I run an application (like krusader) as another user (like www-data) in Gnome?\nor is there any other solution for my case? (tough I'm really curious to know the answer!)\nkeep in mind that I know I can run it as root! but this will cause some permission problems when using cp and mkdir, you know.\nPS:\nsudo and gksudo did not help:\n$ gksudo -u -www-data krusader\nNo protocol specified\nkrusader: cannot connect to X server :0.0\n\nFinal Note:\naccording the best answer, i did chmod u+w /path/to/www and my problem solved. but i still has not been succeeded in opening krusader as another user!\n\nA: xhost +SI:localuser:uname\ngksudo -u uname -l \"firefox\"\nxhost -SI:localuser:uname\n\nWhere uname = the name of impersonated user. Seen there:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10399617\nWorks on my maverick box, there's no sound in the forked skype and ~/.profile.d is not executed as it might.\n\nA: If you're running this from the menu system you'll want to use alacarte (System > Preferences > Main Menu) and change the entry for krusader and add in front of it: gksudo -u www-data which should produce something like:\ngksudo -u www-data krusader\nThis will launch the administrative task prompt window which, according to the GKSudo Manpage, is a\n\nGTK+ Frontend for su and sudo\n\nUsing just gksudo without the -u switch will run the command as root.\n\nA: Like Marco mentioned you can use gksudo -u www-data <command> to run commands as another user. I routinely use this to run commands as gdm and so far it has never asked me for anything other than my own password.\nIf you are using kde the equivalent is kdesu -u www-data krusader.I think, since krusader is a kde application, it might work better with kdesu. More details about kdesu here.\nI have used gksudo to run commands as other \"human\" users on the system and when I am prompted for password, I type in mine.\n\nA: To become www-data with your own password, use this:\n$ sudo su www-data\n[sudo] password for <your username>: [enter your password]\n$ whoami\n(you should see www-data here)\n\nBut, I don't think you'll be able to run GUI apps from there..\nI usually just own everything in /var/www, but allow read access to everyone:\n/var/www$ sudo chown -R [your-username]\\:[your-group] *\n/var/www$ find . -type d -exec chmod a+rx {} \\;\n/var/www$ find . -type f -exec chmod a+r {} \\;\n\nI hope that will ease your pain :)\n\nA: Rethinking about this question (I hope to have understood your problem right, but correct me if I'm wrong), I found an another solution and I think you don't need to run the application as www-data nor to play with permissions. You said that:\n\nApache's DocumentRoot should be under\n  chown www-data:www-data /path/to/www\n\nbut actually, this isn't fully true: Apache's DocumentRoot must be readable by www-data, but not necessarily owned by it. By default, in Ubuntu Desktop, all files and directories you create are readable by everybody, so you can set your DocumentRoot to a directory inside your home folder, for example:\nDocumentRoot /home/user/my-project/my-document-root\n\n\nA: I believe you need to run the following at the terminal:  \nxhost +SI:localuser:<user-to-run-as>\n\nThen you can do:\nsudo su - <user-to-run-as>\n\nAnd lastly, run your app:\nkrusader\n\nThat should do it, just be sure to replace <user-to-run-as> with your username of course.\n\nA: Both 'gksu' and 'kdesu' are graphical frontends for 'sudo', which is the tool you should use when you're in a text-only environment. The 'gksu' and 'kdesu' tools require you to be in a graphical mode, that explains the \"cannot connect to X server\" errors.\nif you want to execute a console command as a different user you use the command 'sudo -u username command'.\n\nA: Running a graphical application under www-data gives you several problems. A thing you can do is adding yourself to the www-data group, so you'll be able to change all the files you need:\nsudo adduser $USER www-data\n\nNote: probably, you'll need to log out from the session for the change to take effect.\nIf, after this command, you are still unable to change some files, just ensure that you have write permission on them:\nsudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/file\nchmod g+w /var/www/file\n\n\nA: Inspired by Anton S. Kraievoy I used similar solution, which works for me. In the user, which using Krusader I added a new user to xhhost:\nxhost +SI:localuser:username\n\nThan kindly login:\nsu - username\n\nThan krusader starts properly as a new instance in a new user:\nkrusader\n\nNotice, that a new configuration will be created in ~/.kde/share/config/krusaderrc.\n", "Q: How do I install kernel 2.6.35 in 10.04? I have encountered a bug relating to stock kernel 2.6.32 in lucid, so I want to upgrade to 2.6.35.

Scenario\nI have a headless Ubuntu 10.10 RC box running a few service applications on my home network. I have a Windows 2008 Server hosting all my network shares and hard drives. I am currently mounting the network drives at boot-up using FSTAB with the following options set:\ncredentails=/etc/smbcredentials,\niocharset=utf8,uid=1000,gid=1000,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,noserverino,sfu\nQuestion\nWhat option do I need to set to get SYMLINKS to properly register using CIFS? \nI have to admit the info in man mount.cifs doesn't seem to provide a clear enough definition of which options I should be using for proper support.\nProblem\nWhen running RSYNC from the Ubuntu machine to back up selected folders to the Windows shares, it fails trying to recreate the SYMLINKS. I am concerned that this will create a problem when later trying to restore these files back should I ever need to.\n\nA: Not sure, but I fear that a cifs share, that in your case is essentially a folder on a ntfs partition available through the network, cannot manage symbolic links.\nDifferent would be the case if the cifs share were provided by a samba server on a linux machine.\nThe solution that come to mind is:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a huge enough file on the share (with dd, for example)\n\n*create a ext4 filesystem on this file\n\n*mount the file as a partition image, with -o loop\n\n*use this ext4 partition as a destination for your backup\n\n\nA: I'm pretty sure that prior to Vista, \"symbolic links\" in Windows (called Junctions in the MS world) could only link a directory to another directory. I doubt that cifs will be able to create junctions on a Windows share, although I see that SMB supports ioctl-style calls, so there might be a chance that a savvy client can coerce a Windows server into creating a junction.\nMy problem is that I want to use pxelinux to mount a Windows directory share to boot a Linux box from. It would be nice to have the file system that is accessible from Windows, because then you can expose parts of the file system on your boot server without relying on the booted machine running.\nThe solution I came up with is to use NFS on Cygwin. This way you can still expose the NFS mount to your Linux network. You can then use regular Windows shares to expose the same directories to your Windows network if you like.\nSo far, experimenting with this in a virtual machine proves to be very helpful.\n-Waldemar\n", "Q: How can I email an attachment from the command line Is it possible to email attachments from the command line?\nIf possible, I'd like something as simple as:\nmail -a myfile.txt -t me@example.com -s \"Here's my file\"\n\n\nA: I found that the command and parameters have been changed recently.\nIf your want to send your attachments with this command:\nmail -s \"your subject\" you@gmail.com -A /your/attachment/absolute/path < /home/you/message.txt\n\nThe option attachment should be -A which is CAPITAL A.\n\nA: You may want to send a file from the shell, but otherwise use Thunderbird.\nIn this case, try thunderbird -remote ... is useful - assuming thunderbird is usually running:\nThe command opens a mail compose window of a running thunderbird instance.\nThe \"From\" address is your default address configured in thunderbird.\nAlso, the existing account settings are used, there is no separate setup needed.\nFor a mail adressed to you@example.com, with subject \"S\", body \"B\", and an attachment /some/absolute/file.txt, the command is\nthunderbird -remote \"xfeDoCommand(composeMessage,subject='S',to='you@example.com',body='B',attachment='/some/absolute/file.txt')\"\n\nThere are two problems: \nThe attached file needs to be given by an absolute path, which is tedious in practice.

But I am wondering whether there will be data loss during the upgrade.\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will the applications that I have installed on 8.10 still be there after upgrade?\n\n*Will the settings of application such as the bookmarks for Firefox and for Google Chrome be preserved?\n\n*Will all the personal files under my home directory be preserved?\nIs there anything else I need to know about upgrading?\n\nA: You can upgrade all currently supported versions of Ubuntu (Ubuntu 12.04/14.04/16.04) without losing your installed applications and stored files. Packages should only be removed by the upgrade if they were originally installed as dependencies of other packages, or if they conflict with newly installed packages. Upgrades between Long Term Support (LTS) releases are not enabled by default until the first point release. It is recommended that most LTS users wait until then before upgrading.\nYou can also upgrade Ubuntu without deleting Windows or losing your Windows files if you are dual booting Ubuntu with Windows. \nBacking up all your personal files before upgrading is still advised in case anything goes wrong with the upgrade. Once I installed Ubuntu in VirtualBox and immediately upgraded it to the next version, but I still got some error messages while upgrading. This illustrates how prone to errors upgrading can be, which is why you should backup your data before upgrading. Despite those error messages, Ubuntu worked perfectly after upgrading it.\n\nA: I up-voted Jorge's answer.  However, I always back up all documents onto another hard drive and perform a 100% new install.  Everything seems to work better that way.  I also use \"save markings\" in Synaptic to reinstall all my packages.  In ANY scenario, I have no trust my data will be preserved!  There is too much at stake.  \n\nA: According to the documentation:\n\nRenewing the Installation without\n  formating the partitons (in contrast\n  to upgrading), will also keep the\n  personal data and configurations under\n  /home but will renew all system\n  settings under /etc as well as the\n  default set of installed packages.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to upgrade from 8.10 directly to 10.04. You would need to upgrade to 9.04, then 9.10, and then finally 10.04. This can be a long and painstaking process, so in your case I would recommend doing a new install over your existing install, which will not format your drive. (More detail here). The installer will preserve the data in your home directory but do an install over the rest of the system.\nAs always with every upgrade please make sure you backup your important data.\n\nA: For what it's worth, I have done the upgrade route. It took a long time, but I didn't lose any data in the process. The trickiest thing is that you do have to tackle any hardware incompatibilities that might have plagued each release. With 9.10 in particular I had major video problems that would black out my screen--making solving the problem pretty tricky! So in theory upgrading through several releases does work without data loss, but in practice it can be a real hassle.\nYou can do a fresh install, though, without backing up to a separate hard drive (or losing your data) if you set up a separate partition on your hard drive for your /home folder. Then just do a fresh install of the operating system and choose the main partition for the OS installation during the setup process. Either during setup or afterward (using GParted) you can mount the partition with all of your user data to the /user location again and you're ready to go. If you Google it, there are quite a few good articles that walk you through the process.\nOf course, the actual software still needs to be installed again, even with a separate /home partition. But the trade-off is that your OS partition can be set up using a newer file system like ext4 that will give you better performance. If you do have to reinstall your applications, the new Software Center makes it pretty easy and quick. Also, I'd recommend installing Ubuntu Tweak early in the process, since it gives you a nice quick interface for setting up common outside repositories (like medibuntu or the Mozilla repos) that would otherwise involve some surfing around to find the PPA addresses.\n", "Q: Installing packages in multiple systems I have to install some packages in 5 Ubuntu system in my office. There, bandwidth is limited. So, is there any way to install it in one system & copy to other, so that all works fine?

I can change the size of the partition and add another but I don't know how to set the file structure to recognize it as Home.\n\nA: Create the new partition and write the changes to disk. Note the device that is associated with the partition: it will be something like /dev/sda5.\nFire up a terminal, then execute:\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/\n\nLocate the device that you created.

I'm still at the \"figure out what the problem even is\" stage of troubleshooting.\nThe symptom: Amarok is skipping every few minutes in an up-to-date installation of Ubuntu 10.10.\nWhat I've checked so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Movie Player (Totem) does not skip when playing the same files.\n\n*The skips do not correlate with increased CPU, memory, disk, or network usage.\n\n*amarok --debug does not output anything when a skip occurs.\n\n\nWhere should one look to troubleshoot skipping audio?\n\nA: Since Totem works, it is almost certainly due to the different codec engines in use.  Totem and GNOME in general use gstreamer.  Amarok and KDE in general use phonon, which in turn uses the xine codec engine by default in Ubuntu, though it can also use gstreamer.\nSee Amarok's wiki page about phonon.\nIt sounds like things may work for you if you install phonon-backend-gstreamer and switch to it by default (configure via Settings --> Configure Amarok --> Playback --> Sound System Configuration --> Backend).  I'm not sure that won't regress audio playback in new ways though.\n\nA: I'm assuming you already tried fiddling with your cables, and different speakers (headphones)\n\n\n*\n\n*Try a different player. If that fixes it, try reinstalling Amarok. If that doesn't work, try running CPU monitor or top to see if your machine is doing something every few minutes.\n\n*If it's a problem with several players, you could try running off the live CD. \n", "Q: Changing PPAs from lucid to maverick \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a tool to update my PPA sources.list entries after upgrading? \n\nI recently upgraded to Maverick and I have a not so long list of PPAs. Is there a way to quickly change the distribution from lucid to maverick without using a text editor?\n\nA: See this question and answers for all the info about PPAs. However the direct answer is as follows:\nA PPA is not restricted to a particular release (like lucid, maverick etc). The same ppa normally contains versions for many distributions and this is the preferred way of migrating ppa's over to new distribution releases - where most of the effort is on the ppa owner.\nSo simply adding back the ppa to your sources list will make the maverick version of updates and new packages from the ppa available immediately to you. Of course, if the maintainer has not released versions for maverick yet, then these won't be available now, but as soon as these are posted they will be picked up \"automagically\" :-).\nIf you are not using add-apt-repository or providing the apt-line to synaptic (which are both distribution neutral) and are directly editing files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d or in synaptic, take care to replace any occurrence of the word lucid with maverick\n\nA: My advice is install ubuntu tweak, this software can do it for you automatically\n\nA: I believe it is up to the owners of the PPAs to update them to maverick.  I tried reactivating some of my PPAs that were disabled during the update as maverick PPAs, and several of them returned 404 errors, not found.\n\nA: You need to manually check each ppa since some of them hadn't migrated to maverick yet.\nthat's why ubuntu upgrade procdeure leave them (the ppa sources.list.d entries) unchanged and disabled.\n", "Q: Speech Recognition API Is there a speech recognition API for Ubuntu/Linux? I have a school project and I need to transform speach to written text. The programming language isn't a problem.

I've also searched google and couldn't really find much info.\n\nA: The two major open source speech-recognition engines in Ubuntu are Julius and Pocketsphinx. Both of these are quite low-level research projects, and you'll need to do a lot of reading and experimenting to be able to use them: they're not simple install-and-go projects. Simon Listens, as mentioned above, is a simple install-and-go project, and the Simon Listens project has a specific installation for Ubuntu -- http://www.cyber-byte.at/wiki/index.php/Installation#Ubuntu has instructions on how to enable it -- but that only works with 10.04, not the recently-released 10.10.

I was wondering since in Ubuntu 10.10 I have the ability to create both xz and lzma archives. Should I switch to xz?\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lzma\n\nA: Definitely you shouldn't use lzma as others say.\nAntonio Diaz Diaz, author of lzip format, says Xz format is inadequate for long-term archiving.\nIf you want to backup your important files, consider other file formats such as bzip2, which has corruption recovery tool.\n\nA: I disagree with @dv3500ea's conclusion, \"OK using either\", as it was inappropriate.  Even at the posted date/time, .lzma files were known to be replaced completely by .xz.  The author of both Utils has said publicly, users should transition to XZ-Utils ≥ 5.00. The last LZMA-Utils release was 2008-07-30, and discontinued.\n\nLZMA Utils are legacy data compression software with high compression ratio. LZMA Utils are no longer developed, although critical bugs may be fixed as long as fixing them doesn't require huge changes to the code.\nUsers of LZMA Utils should move to XZ Utils. XZ Utils support the legacy .lzma format used by LZMA Utils, and can also emulate the command line tools of LZMA Utils. This should make transition from LZMA Utils to XZ Utils relatively easy.\n\nThe determining factor might not be compression, although ironically it was for this example.  \"practical reasons\" are a self-evident, and significant, reason to use XZ-Utils. Additionally the .xz format allows you to specify compression algorithms, and filters, so .xz files can use either LZMA or LZMA2.  Avoid creating new .lzma files, they are considered a legacy format.\nAs for even keeping LZMA-Utils around: don't. XZ-Utils has support for legacy .lzma files.  It also has wrappers for scripts still using LZMA-Utils.  If all those reasons were still insufficient, Ubuntu dropped legacy lzma-utils from its repository.\n\nA: This benchmark provides some good information about this issue. It seems that LZMA has slightly better compression ratios and performance than XZ but XZ is generally preferred due to 'practical reasons' (I'm not sure what these are).\nXZ is an implementation of the lzma2 algorithm and is better at compressing 'uncompressable' data:\n\nlzma2 is the method of compression employed by the 7-Zip LZMA2 compressor. LZMA2 is a modified version of LZMA that offers a better compression ratio for uncompressible data (random data expands about 0.005%, compared to 1.35% with original LZMA), and optionally can compress multiple parts of large files in parallel, greatly increasing compression speed but with a possible reduction in compression ratio (see LZMANumBlockThreads). Like LZMA, it can consume a lot of memory; see the above table. If a compression level isn't specified, it defaults to max.\n\n(http://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setup_compression)\nYou should be OK using either.\n\nA: xz is preferred due to it having the highest compression rate. However, it compresses slower, but it makes up for it with its compression.\n", "Q: How to get the mic on the Creative X-Mod soundcard working correctly? Well, I have this problem for a while now.

On your CPU model, a single page with a flash video (YouTube) should use about 25-35% of your CPU. Depending on the embedded flash player used by different sites, CPU usage can be higher than that.\nCheck my flash optimization tutorial for some tips:\nhttp://firefox-tutorials.blogspot.com/2010/05/flash-optimization.html\n\nA: Wine is CPU-intensive. If you open up your System Monitor and switch to the Resources tab, you will see that one of the cores is used up entirely. That is especially true of games like Counter-Strike:Source and similar.\nFlash should not take up much CPU, and hence should not produce much heat. Though, of course, having many sites open with flashy Flash in them is a bad idea - it all adds up, small or not.\nYou can try to get the GPU temperature down by using NVidia's proprietary drivers, as it does some fan control and is generally more efficient than the nouveau driver shipped in Ubuntu by default.\nAnd seeing that it is a laptop, both GPU and CPU temperatures can be beaten down with proper air circulation - make sure there's a lot of space under the laptop, or use a fan stand.\n\nA: \nCheck my flash optimization tutorial for some tips:\nhttp://firefox-tutorials.blogspot.com/2010/05/flash-optimization.html\n\nThank you lovinglinux for your flash optimization tutorial.

In 10.10 Ubuntu Netbook edition the panel is even more locked down than in 10.04. Is it possible to unlock it so that one can add/remove things from it? Will the 10.04 method of unlocking work with 10.10?\n\nA: No, that method won't work, as the new UNE interface uses a specifically created panel, not in any form related to the old gnome-panel UNE in Lucid used. So, as of now, you really can't customize/add/remove things. \nThis new panel only holds down the indicator-applet (indicator-applet-complete) package. Let's see what's coming in Natty for UNE and if options like this one, autohide, etc, are added.\n\nA: The Ubuntu Network Edition has the Unity interface. This provides the dock on the side and the panel. The panel is not gnome-panel, but part of unity so you can't add panel applets to it. I think Unity is deliberately unconfigurable to improve usability (it is up to you whether or not you agree with this philosophy). \nIf you want a more configurable interface, you can switch to using a normal GNOME desktop. You can add a panel applet for the global menu to the GNOME panel and use a dock such as docky. This will give you a similar, but more configurable) interface.

I have only one partition (and don't have any plans yet to create another partition). Is it possible to keep the /home folder while installing aside from backing it up to an external drive and do a clean install?\n\nA: It's entirely possible to do just that. Simply run the installer, and when you get to the partitioning options, go for manual partitioning, and mark your single partition as root (/) BUT DO NOT FORMAT IT.\nProceed from here as normal and the installer will simply overwrite the existing system files, and anything else that isn't a system file (such as the contents of your home directory) will be ignored.

I would prefer it to require a click such that I don't keep accidentally activating it upon mouse over.\n\nA: The Activities configurator extension has an option to disable the \"Activities\" hotspot. It is called \"Disable Hot Corner\". Also, by default, the text is replaced by an icon -- this saves space.\n\nWorks for Ubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: In 11.10 and later versions, you can disable the hot corner by installing the \"No Topleft Hot Corner\" extension from the official Gnome-shell extensions site. \n\nA: Download extension.js and metadata.json from https://github.com/hermanus/gnome-shell-extensions/tree/master/Gnome-shell-activities-hotspot-disabler and put them in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/activitieshotspotdisabler@harmus.gmail.com/.\nThe name of the directory is important -- you can change it if you change the uuid in metadata.json too.\nThis will install an extension that overrides the Panel.HotCorner.prototype._onCornerEntered function, so the activities screen is only shown when you click on 'Activities'.

If I upgrade to 10.10 will both desktops, KDE and Gnome, be upgraded too?\n\nA: Yes, a system upgrade will upgrade all packages including KDE and Gnome, no matter whether you're using Ubuntu or Kubuntu.\n\nA: Yes, all installed packages should be updated when you switch to 10.10. Unless, of course, 10.10 does not have newer versions of the packages.\n\nA: Yes, and you can do the same from a fresh installation. Just back up your installed package list to  a text file using Synaptic. Go to File, Save Markings (tick box save full state). Copy the file to a usb key or somewhere safe. Re-install and then open Synaptic and choose Read markings and point to the text file. Come back when Synaptic is done and you have things back to normal.\nI know that you asked about upgrades, but they don't always work out and fresh installations are always better because in my experience, they never fail. :)\n", "Q: How to clean caches in my homedir My home directory is getting huge (100GB plus). When backupping it I notices that there are quite some caches there.\nWhich important caches are there in my homedir and how should I clean them?\nOne cache in particular is bothering me, the cache in .gvfs, where a copy of my network harddisk seems to be stored. How do I neatly clear this cache?\n\nA: The .gvfs is where network attached folders live.  If you've used \"Places/Connect to Server\", or typed smb://server/share into Nautilus, that's where your network drive will \"mount\".\nYou need to exclude your .gvfs folder from your back up, unless you actually want your network drive and all its contents to be included in your back up.\nOther places you should consider excluding :\n\n*\n\n*~/.mozilla/**yourprofilename**/Cache\n\n*~/.cache  (this is also where Chromium puts its cache, if you use that instead of firefox)\n\n*~/.thumbnails\nOthers to consider :\n\n*\n\n*if you use VirtualBox, your guest systems are likely stored in .VirtualBox.  On the one hand, you'll want to back those up.  On the other, they'll be huge, so maybe you should back them up separately from your generic home drive backup?\n\n*if you use Dropbox, you'll probably not have much need to back that up!  Exclude wherever you told Dropbox to put its folder.\n\nFinally, you can do some of this analysis yourself!  Go to your Applications menu and choose Accessories, then run \"Disk Usage Analyzer\" (AKA baobab).\n\nA: Are you certain that .gvfs actually includes COPY of your network hard disk or it is it just mounting point. Try to unmount those hard disks and check what it says it's size after that.\nThink flash and browsers saves their caches to your home folder. Those are best to clear through browser's tools.\n\nA: For this purpose I have a cron task that runs periodically (for eg. @monthly) executing BleachBit (manual) in the command-line mode silently. Edit it with crontab -e:\n0 1 1 */2 *  bleachbit --clean apt.autoclean chromium.cache deepscan.ds_store deepscan.thumbs_db firefox.cache google_chrome.cache nautilus.history system.cache thunderbird.cache\n\nI configured it with GNOME Schedule GUI (source, removed as deb package, only available as snap; Last Update: 2016-05-25).\nYou can run\nbleachbit --list-cleaners | column\n\nto choose which cleaners you want to execute.\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu Light? How can ubuntu light be installed?\nOr is Ubuntu Light only available to OEM's ??\n\nA: It's only and it will only be available for OEM's. Each Ubuntu Light image is specifically adapted to the device it's gonna run in. So the best way to get Ubuntu Light, now, is waiting. Waiting for Light devices in the market, and from what I've read that should happen still this year.\n\nA: I remember reading (sorry couldn't find the source anymore) that \"ubuntu light\" will only be available to OEMs, as it is configured specifically for the hardware to archive even faster boot and so forth.\nYou can however use the Unity desktop environment with any new Ubuntu installation which is essentially the same (minus the hardware specific configurations).\n\nA: As indicated in this answer for Where do I get the source code for Ubuntu Light?, you can get the source code for Ubuntu Light as used by Dell.

I tried to upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10 - now that Ubuntu 10.10 is finally released. I used update-manager -d and the first window after pressing the upgrade button says that it is still a development release.\nIs this true? Or have they not changed this window yet?\n\nA: update-manager -d is the command to upgrade to development trunk versions of Ubuntu.\nHowever, I think I recall Ubuntu updates the repositories to notify about the new release a few days after the release is live so that when people are prompted to upgrade, the bandwidth use spike from the day 1 enthusiasts has been fully absorbed. By using that route, you should still end up with a copy of \"blessed\" Ubuntu 10.10.\nThat said, even if it was marked as a development version, it wouldn't be any different.

Let the answering begin...\n\nA: Unfortunately, you do need to \"compile half of the GNOME desktop\" to get the most up-to-date git snapshots of GNOME-Shell. Well maybe a quarter. Luckily, there is a set up script and JHBuild moduleset that you can use to build it and satisfy the dependencies fairly easily.\nFirst, download and run the setup script:\ncurl -O http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/plain/tools/build/gnome-shell-build-setup.sh\n/bin/bash gnome-shell-build-setup.sh\n\nThen build GNOME-Shell and its dependencies by running:\njhbuild build\n\nMore detailed information on the process can be found on the GNOME wiki.\nIf this isn't working, you might want to check the list of common problems on the wiki. Work-a-rounds can often be found there.\n\nA: have you tried the steps in the following article at WebUpd8?\n\nA: gnome-shell can be found from ubuntu's repositories\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\nand think it is good enough for testing purposes. You can try it within terminal by (after install) typing gnome-shell --replace. You will get version 2.31.5 in Maverick. (That version seems to be also 2nd-latest tagged version in http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/ )\n\nA: I'll focus on question #2 -\nYou said \"I've tried with jhbuild just yesterday and only some modules were built, but gnome-shell and gtk3 weren't included in those that built\" and then asked\n\"Can jhbuild gnome-shell install script be fixed in order to allow a clean build?\"\nI would think so.  First, http://live.gnome.org/JhbuildDependencies/Ubuntu tells you what Ubuntu packages you need installed - use the Lucid installation, keeping in mind the comments from the Maverick section.\nThen - what is the moduleset in you're .jhbuildrc?  The default is gnome-3.0 so I'll assume is that.  The rc file points to the moduleset you'll be using.\nUsually people doing a full \"jhbuild build\" skip certain packages and put that skipping in their .jhbuildrc.  You can read elsewhere, but building mozilla within an environment just to test gnome is something most people skip.\nActually, if you're having problems, I would suggest you not do an argument-less \"jhbuild build\" at all.  \"jhbuild build\" without arguments builds everything in your moduleset, which I'll assume is gnome-3.0 (look in your .jhbuildrc to see).  Better to do \"jhbuild build gnome-shell\", which builds only gnome-shell and its dependencies (I believe gnome-shell currently has a total of 36 dependencies in jhbuild - that includes a count of not only dependencies, but the dependencies of the dependencies and so forth).  Once it's built, you can do a \"jhbuild run gnome-shell\" to run gnome-shell using the libraries etc. you have built.\nI should note, if you're doing a jhbuild off of recent code, it can be rough sailing, although it's still the easiest way to go if there's no PPA for Ubuntu that you like.  I just did a fresh jhbuild.  gtk+ broke on some calls, so I browsed git, saw that that had been changed in the day before I installed git, so I git reset that directory to one from 24 hours before.  I then worked.  Also, the package I wanted to build would not build.  I searched the Bugzilla page for patches which updated some calls which had been deprecated long ago and recently removed by the gtk+ dependency.  I applied them and it then my gtk+ 3 dependent built.  So it was not automagic, I had to fix two broken builds.  But it finally built.\n\nA: There likely won't be a PPA for 10.10. For 11.04 here are the instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install and use the latest version of GNOME?\n", "Q: Can I see why a package is installed? For a specific package, can I find out why it is installed?\nSo, can I see or it's manually installed, or that it is installed as a dependency of another package? Or that it is installed as part of the distro?\n\nA: A quick and short reasoning on why a certain package was installed can be found out by typing the following command in a terminal (Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal) :\naptitude why <package-name>\n\nReplace  with the name of the package you are interested in. For example, typing aptitude why libgoo-canvas-perl outputs the following :\ni   shutter Suggests libgoo-canvas-perl\n\nThis basically means that the package shutter in this case has suggested libgoo-canvas-perl be installed. By then typing aptitude why shutter I can walk up the dependency chain.\nHowever, there is a caveat. I often notice aptitude finds the most plausible explanation for the situation that may not be the actual case, but will nevertheless give you a clue to look further.\nIn my case, shutter suggests libgoo-canvas-perl - however, suggested packages are not automatically installed by default. Nevertheless, it jogs my memory of the \"experience\" with not being able to edit screenshots with shutter which led me to manually install ligbgoo-canvas-perl\nFinally, you can find out whether a package was installed automatically (meaning decided by the package management system as mandatory from looking at dependencies and recommendations of other packages you asked it to install) by running following command.\naptitude show <package-name>\n\nThis will output a line like below (3rd line of the output) :\nAutomatically installed: no\n\nFor more info run info aptitude (in a terminal) or visit the Aptitude wiki page\nTo find out when a particular package was installed, there are 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Synaptic package manager maintains a history log of all activity. To view the history log file, choose History from the File menu. You can search for Install (mind the case) to list all entries regarding installation. However, this will only show the packages installed using Synaptic\n\n*Run the following command in a terminal. This will search dpkg logs for installation history entries. However, there is maximum limit of how much of these logs are retained, so if the package you are looking for was installed a long time ago, you may not find it. More details here\nzcat -f /var/log/dpkg.log* | grep \"\\ install\\ \" | grep -i <package-name>\n\n\nA: A quick solution is to enter the following command in a terminal:\naptitude why $package\n\nor, if you are only interested in the ultimate cause:\naptitude why $package --show-summary\n\nReplace $package with the package's name, and you may need to install the aptitude package first.\nHere is output you might get for aptitude why aspell --show-summary\nPackages requiring aspell:\n  inkscape\n\nFor more detail you would run aptitude why aspell. You can read the example output, below, as follows: \"You manually installed inkscape, which requires libgtkspell, which requires libenchantic2a, which requires aspell\". (i markers indicate installed packages; A markers indicate automatically installed packages.)\ni   inkscape       Depends libgtkspell0 (>= 2.0.10)                                                                    \ni A libgtkspell0   Depends libenchant1c2a (>= 1.6.0)                                                                   \ni A libenchant1c2a Depends aspell-en | myspell-dictionary | aspell-dictionary | ispell-dictionary | hunspell-dictionary\ni A aspell-en      Depends aspell (>= 0.60.3-2)\n\nFinally, the following command\napt-cache rdepends --installed $package\n\nlists the other packages installed on your computer that depend directly on $package. You can add the --recurse option to list all packages that depend directly or indirectly on it.\n\nA: Yes, you can, and it's a pretty obvious command, in fact. Assuming you've aptitude installed, you can open up a Terminal Window ad type:\naptitude why package\n\nThat should give a list of packages that depend on that specific package. If it's a manually installed package, it will say something like \"It wasn't possible to find a reason to install package\".\n\nA: Here's a simple way that doesn't rely on aptitude, which 10.10 doesn't ship by default anymore.\nGraphically\nOpen Synaptic and try to remove it.\nIf a dialog pops up asking you to delete other packages, those are the packages that (recursively) depend upon it.\nFrom terminal\napt-get remove package_name_goes_here -s\n\nAgain, the packages that would be removed as a result are all those that (recursively) depend on it. (The -s parameter tells apt-get to not actually remove the package.)\n", "Q: Where Kblocks store the highscore?

I guess, that is not necessary Unity fault that everything is slow.\nThere are many tips about performance of Ubuntu on this hardware.\n\nA: A specific answer to your 'files and folders being slow' query is that this is a known issue in Nautilus. To see this really in action open /usr/lib or /usr/bin. Basically nautilus has this feature where to looks to identify file types, etc, and this can take a while, specially on slow spinning disks.\nOne fix here is to change your file manager to pcmanfm, which is a lightweight file manager and skips the file lookup stuff that nautilus does. This thread should outline how-to - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=692238\nYour desktop will still be rendered via nautilus, but you can change all other filemanager actions to this filemanager, and have lookups be speedy.\n\nA: May be this is not an answer that you expect, but you can try some other Ubuntu distros like Xubuntu and Lubuntu (still in beta).\n\nA: Not really an answer, but more of a work around...\n1) Log off\n2) Click on your Username\n3) Set the session to \"Ubuntu Desktop Edition\"\n4) Complete log in\nThe you'll be running normal Ubuntu, which should be snappier than Unity.\nFYI, I'm also experiencing really bad performance with Unity. It's a shame because it's a nice interface!\n\nA: It is said that Zeitgeist is slowing unity animations and increase cpu usage.\nZeitgeist is a service which logs the users's activities and events, anywhere from files opened to websites visited and conversations. It makes this information readily available for other applications to use in the form of timelines and statistics.\nYou can remove zeitgeist easily, but don't remove libzeitgeist-XXX if you use unity :\nsudo apt-get purge zeitgeist zeitgest-core zeitgeist-datahub\n", "Q: How do I reinstall Ubuntu? I have Ubuntu 10.04 on my computer, with Windows 7 next to it. Instead of upgrading to 10.10, I feel like doing a clean install. However, I don't want to erase my Windows, even though I barely ever use it. My question is: how would I remove Ubuntu 10.04 from my drive and install Ubuntu 10.10 in place, without losing any space or anything, or losing Windows 7?\n\nA: This option actually exists in the installer. When it comes to the partitioning section of the installation, there is an option to overwrite an existing Linux distro and replace it with the new one. Just select that and you're on your way.\n\nA: First, make a back up of Windows to an external device such as a DVD or USB hard drive, if you have not already done so.  You'll be installing an operating system, which has inherent risks, and I'd hate for you to lose important data.\nStart up the Ubuntu 10.10 desktop CD installer, and click through all of the steps until you get to partitioning.  Select advanced partitioning and continue to the next page.\nNow, select the partition that was created for Ubuntu 10.04.  It will be an ext4 filesystem, and, if you don't have a recovery partition for Windows, it is likely to be /dev/sda2.  Hit edit, then select / for the mountpoint and make sure the format button is not checked.  Dismiss the dialog and press next.\nYou should see a warning that continuing will remove the contents of system directories, but will preserve the contents of /home.  Press continue and complete the rest of the installation.\n\nA: But if you wanted to know the manual way of doing it, you would just reformat your linux partition, and then install to it. That's why it is recommended to keep personal data (e.g. home directory) on separate partition.\n", "Q: How to remove shadow from gnome-panel? How can I remove this shadow: \n\nfrom gnome-panel?\n\nA: You can do this with compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nrun it and go window decoration settings. Set window shadow to 'none'.\n\nA: NOTE: This solution is for the Unity panel in Ubuntu 11.04+, while the question was asked for gnome-panel.\nReplace /usr/share/unity/3/panel-shadow.png with an invisible image. In other words, edit that PNG file and make it 100% transparent and remove the black shade in the image. The panel shadow will then disappear after a logout/login.\nYou could also create a new PNG file with a width of 1 px (height could be anything, preferably 20px) in gimp \n, and remove the background white layer. The entire PNG will then be transparent, and then you could put this PNG in /usr/share/unity/3/panel-shadow.png.\n\nA: If you want to keep shadows on windows but remove them from the panel, \nInstall compizconfig-settings-manager\nyou can use go to Window decoration\n\nand set Shadow windows to (any) & !(type=Dock).\n\n\nA: you have to disable desktop effect from System>Preferences>Appearances and in the 'visual effects' tab select 'None'\nthough there might be some other way like in compizconfig-settings-manager without disabling desktop effect but that I dont know.\n\nA: Just type or copy paste this: \"any & !(type=dock)\" under 'Shadow Windows' option in CCSM Window Decoration.\n", "Q: I installed an alpha or beta, am I up to date with the final release if I keep upgrading? I installed an Ubuntu alpha or beta and have been keeping it up to date. \nSo, Should I presume that my system has automatically updated to the next alpha or beta, and will be running the official release when it's finished?\n\nA: The beta uses the repositories as they are updated -- it is not a fixed snapshot of Ubuntu as it was when the beta was released.\nIf there are no more updates to be installed, then congratulations!

I have also tried a program called Novell Client for Linux but, it didn't fully support Ubuntu, it was butt ugly, the latest release was made in 2004.\nIf you guys could help me out on this I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: It is possible to access NetStorage through WebDav in Ubuntu. You need to install the fusedav package and run something along the lines of:\nfusedav -D -u username -p password_here http://server.com/oneNet/NetStorage /home/greg/netstorage\n\nThis isn't quite perfect, it occasionally goes a little buggy on me, but works for the most part. You might be interested to know I started a bug about not being able to connect in Nautilus to NetStorage.\nYou may also be interested to know about ncpfs (see below & Google it), though I haven't used it myself.\n\nncpfs allows you to mount volumes of NetWare servers under Linux and to print to NetWare print queues and spool NetWare print queues to the Linux printing system.\n\n\nA: You could use Novell CIFS.\nThis is a role which you have to install on the OES server.\nThen Linux / Windows / Mac clients can access the share without a novell client but just SMB(CIFS).\nJoeri\n\nA: If it allows mounting by webdav i would try to install davfs2-package and mount directly from Places->Connect to server... -> And from type choose WebDav.\nIf you put bookmark on it it stays on Placec bar on nautilus (file browser) so you can easily mount it again when need.\n", "Q: Is there any way I can get my Google Chrome to go back a page by pressing backspace?

Then you could at least run it in windowed mode on a single screen.\nFor a more complete solution, this thread on the Boxee forum may be helpful. It's been a while since I used Boxee on a dual screen system, but when I did, I used something similar to what's outline there.\n\nA: Try pressing the \\ key in Boxee and it will go into windowed mode.

It makes ALL games unplayable.\nWhat is weird is this only happens for games.

I went through the process of recovery and everything seemed fine. However, when I restart the computer I'm presented with \ngrub rescue >\n\nNow, my understanding is that when I installed Ubuntu \"side by side\" it replaced the MBR or something like it, with GRUB. \nI've read on a slew of forums, that I need to use a Windows Recovery Disk. \nHere are my issues: \na) I don't have a recovery disk, I have a recovery partition - it's a netbook.\nb) I don't have an external cd drive. \nWhat I do have is a USB key that has about 1gb of space on it. \nThanks in advance. \n\nA: You may download the Boot-repair Disk iso images and burn it to a USB stick.

Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available.\n\nIt really works, I use it to repair a Win7 disk which MBR was accidentally over written by GRUB during the installation of Debian.\n\nA: Consider Super Grub Disc as a solution. You can put it on your pendrive with Unetbootin and boot to your pendrive. Select Windows and then Fix boot of Windows to restore your Widows MBR(no Ubuntu access with this potion) or GNU/Linux followed by the Fix Boot option(If you want both Ubuntu and Windows). You may then reboot and get access to your OS's(depending on your choice, you may only get the Windows MBR). Note that although Super Grub Disk is outdated, Super Grub Disk 2 does not work, and so you should use Super Grub Disk.\n\nA: install Ubuntu LiveCD on your pendrive, boot from your pendrive, open terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install mbr\nsudo install-mbr -i n -p D -t 0 /dev/sda\n\nReplace /dev/sda with the name of your drive.\nWhat parameters do (from man page):\n\n--interrupt <mode>, -i <mode>\nThis option sets the list of events which will cause the MBR  to display  it's  prompt.   Use  -i +<event> to add an event to the list or -i -<event> to remove an event from the list.  Values of <event> are:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*s – A shift or control key is pressed.\n  \n*k – A non shift-like key is pressed\n  \n*a – The prompt is always displayed.\n  \n*n – Never display the prompt (unless an error occurs).\n  \n  \n  -p <partn>, --partition <partn>\nThis specifies the default boot sector to load.

I've used to have this problem with old (up to this July) drivers and the workaround was to set an external monitor to 60 Hz (by default it was set up to 75 Hz).

If you're connected and you're still getting an error when trying to log into the Ubuntu One site or your computer is not connected, then your best bet is to submit a support request at https://one.ubuntu.com/support/contact You don't need to be logged in to send the request.\n\nA: Check your terminal after executing command:\nubuntuone-launch\n\nMaybe you got any Python's backtrace or something.

Already tried to reset the Standart-Profile in Profile and Backend. But makes no difference. Anybody has an advice what to do to fix it?\n\nA: It often happened to me to think that it was not working because, in contrast to what happens in Microsoft Windows, this functionality only works for non-minimized windows. Are you sure this is not your case?\n\nA: sorry, can't answer via comment because my cookie was deleted.\nYes i think that's not the case. Perhaps it has something to do with a metacity theme i use although i acitvated to use the metacity compositing features via tweak-ubuntu.\nDocky works for showing the preview windows, i can also tweak them for docky in size for example via compizconfig?\n-seems that there are problems with the gnome panel, deleting and adding the windows overview to panel helps for some time, but then previewing is off again. Strange is that the preview works again, when you edit or move the panel. But they works not durable.\n", "Q: Is there a way to control flash video brightness independently, via config file? My monitor brightness is reduced because it was causing me headaches. Web pages are displayed fine, but flash videos are too dark. I can control gecko-mediaplayer plugin brightness via mplayer config, but I'm not able to do the same for flash.\nIn Windows I was able to do that via nvidia driver settings, which allows to control video overlay brightness independently, but the Linux nvidia driver doesn't allow to do that.\n\nA: You can control video overlay settings with the proprietary NVIDIA driver. (nvidia-current package, in case you're using the default nouveau driver.) Open System > Administration > NVIDIA X Server Settings. Hit X Server XVideo Settings in the list on the left, and tweak the values on the right to suit your needs. This should affect anything that uses XVideo, such as most media players.\nThe only issue may be Flash, which could bring you back to square one. It's possible that it does use XVideo (and awesome if it does) but if not you don't have a whole lot of options for that.\nEdit: I tried this out myself, and it turns out Flash is not affected, unfortunately. You may have to wait for Adobe to implement XVideo or video acceleration in Flash unless another solution comes up.\nHowever, it is possible that the darkness issues you're experiencing could also be video driver related, though I've never heard of an instance of this on Linux before.\n\n", "Q: Printers Always Print Pages In Reverse Order I have used Ubuntu for many years and this has always been a problem for me on every printer I encounter (HP, Lexmark, and Samsung, among others).  Whenever I print, the fidelity is fine but instead of printing so that the first page ends up on top of the finished stack, it prints the first page first, then the second page, etc, so that all of the pages are in reverse order.\nIs there a software fix for this?  Is anyone else having this problem?\n\nA: If you go through the menu to \"System > Administration > Printing\" you'll see a list of printers you have install in your machine. right-click on one of them, i.e. the default one, and select \"properties\". Now on the left you have a list select \"Job options\" and hit the \"More\" button to extend the list of options. On \"output order\" if it is normal select reverse and try to print. This might change the order (reverse it) and if, as you claim, your printers print the first page first, the reverse order should now print it last =)\n\nA: When you print in an application the Print Dialog shows up. Ensure that the Reverse option is checked.\n\n\nA: I found a solution in the cups github issues.\nAdd the line \"*DefaultOutputOrder: Reverse\" (without quotes!)  to /etc/cups/ppd/YOURPRINTER.ppd (and change YOURPRINTER to your printer ofcourse).

I don't want to have the same situation with the last MP3 player, which was the Shuffle and it didn't have good compatibility with Ubuntu so I was wondering if the Sony Walkman NWZ-S545 would work with Ubuntu?\nThanks. :) \n\nA: I would advise going with a different mp3 player. A lot of people on the web seem to have issues with making the walkman interact smoothly with audio programs.\nIf you want that particular mp3 player, here's how to make it work with ubuntu:\nhttp://ubuntu-virginia.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=866297\nOtherwise, I'd recommend a generic used iPod nano/classic/touch.

Is there a way to get docky back in gnome-do?\n\nA: Docky and Do were split after it became clear that the Docky theme for Do was collecting a huge amount of code not shared with anything else in Do.\nThe Docky found in the docky package has a large number of extra features and a huge number of bugs fixed (particularly with respect to window matching) compared to the docky theme from Do.\nYou will have a better dock experience with the stand-alone docky package than with the docky theme of the (previous) gnome-do package.\n\nA: Docky and Gnome-Do are now two separate programs. If you want to install Docky, just go to the software center and search for \"Docky\" and it will come right up.\nYou would have to use an old and out-of-date version of Gnome Do to have them both integrated into the same application. It's actually much better that there are now two programs. You get better features and a more stable framework since Docky and GnomeDo were starting to grow into two separate entities.\n\nA: Have you checked the themes for Gnome Do? Last time I used it on Lucid Lynx, on the list of themes for Gnome Do there was the dock theme available.\nDocky has moved forward from Gnome Do to become a dock application only. But, as I recall the dock option is still there.\n\nA: Do you mean that when you activate gnome-do, it pops up where docky would normally be?\nFrom what I understand, you're going to need to have both apps installed. Don't worry, you can have docky disabled but still achieve the cool gnome-do affect.\nIf you need help with that let me know, and i'll edit my post with the info.\nP.S. I reread your question and wanted to say that they are independent applications, but are made by the same company and are designed to be somewhat intertwined (AKA you get more functionality by running both at the same time.)\n\nA: Docky Split from gnome-do a long time ago, it looks as if the transition is complete.\n\nA: Now there are two seperate applications docky and gnome-do, but according to this bug report, there might be a gnome-do integration in docky in future. At least by now the milestone is set to Docky 3.0.0 (but earlier it was 2.2.0 but then moved to 3.0.0 when 2.2.0 was published).

Ubuntu 10.10 has dropped support for i586 and lesser processors, along with i686 processors that do not support the CMOV instruction (Conditional MOVe, AFAIK).\nWhat is so special about the CMOV command? It even has a flag of its own in the flags : line of /proc/cpuinfo.\n\nA: When source code is compiled for the 686 architecture with gcc and the -march flag, gcc will sometimes generate object code which contains the CMOV instruction.  That is because CMOV was an instruction which came with the original 686 architecture which was released 15 years ago.\nA handful of processors which claim to be 686 compatible do not support this instruction.  Thus, a lot of work has to be done to deal with the handful of chips that do not support this standard instruction which has been around for over 15 years and is part of the original 686 architecture any how.  The Ubuntu kernel team has a limited amount of time, and decided it is no longer worth their time to continue supporting supposedly 686 compatible processors which have not been able over the past 15 years to include this instruction which is part of the core 686 instruction set.\nThere's nothing particularly special about the CMOV command itself, other than it was not an instruction in pre-i686 architecture (i486, i586 etc.) and that some supposedly i686 compatible chips do not have the instruction.\n\nA: The CMOV instruction is a predicated (or conditional) move instruction. It combines a branch and move instruction into one opcode.\nThe CMOV instruction is useful in compiler optimization because it helps remove some of the conditional jump instructions from the code. This is important in modern superscalar processors because many instruction are in flight and executed in parallel and a conditional jump instruction would make it harder to predict whether code should be executed or not until the branch is resolved.\n", "Q: Old video card problem I have an old Toshiba Laptop with a very old graphic card \"Trydent CyberAladdin P4 v6.x\"\nAfter installing of Ubuntu 10.04, my screen resolution is 800x600 and this is a maximum size?

I can also paste text with Control-Shift-V.\nRegarding pasting - what happens if you copy something from within the window with control-shift-c and then try a Control-Shift-V paste - does that work?  Or are things in your buffer outside of the window that are failing?  Does a mouse paste work (either to the Edit -> Paste button, or right-click in the window and go down to paste) - especially from material copied from within the window?  If you go to \"Edit -> Keyboard Shortcuts\" does it have an \"Edit: Paste -> Control-Shift-V\" entry?\nAs far as history, I echo what Romanovzky asked - do you have a .bash_history file in your home directory?

When I right-click the desktop icon for my USB drive or SD card I have the choice to \"Eject\" or \"Safely Remove Drive\":\n\nIn the Tree side pane in Nautilus, I can either \"Unmount\" or \"Eject\":\n\nThe Places side pane in Nautilus has some kind of eject icon:\n\nWhat do all of these do?\nSpecifics I've been wondering about include:\n\n\n*\n\n*What happens when a drive has multiple partitions mounted?\n\n*Under what conditions is a prompt to empty the trash displayed?\n\n*Do any of these result in a state in which the drive cannot be mounted again without first being physically reconnected?\n\n\nA: When it comes to USB devices eject only unmounts the device but it is still connected. Removing it might cause damage. After ejecting the device you have to safely remove it to be sure it won't damage yoru device.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure \"safely remove Drive\" unmounts any other partitions on that device.\n\nA: When a drive is connected and its filesystem loaded, it is mounted, as if with the mount (or pmount) command, to a location on the root filesystem (usually somewhere inside /media). When the filesystem is no longer needed, it can be unmounted (as if with the umount or pumount commands), which flushes any pending writes to disk, so that you can remove the drive safely. If the drive is removed without doing this, some pending writes will be lost, and the drive can potentially be rendered unreadable or otherwise lose data.\n\"Safely Remove Drive\" and \"Eject\" are basically equivalent and do two things: It first unmounts the filesystem (as if the umount command were used), then it issues a SCSI eject command (which is accepted by things like CD-ROM drives, and ignored by almost everything else). It works the same as the command-line command eject. Many USB devices seem to respond to the eject command by shutting down or de-registering themselves from the USB host.\nFor most devices, all of these commands are functionally equivalent. For CD-ROM, DVD, Blu ray, etc. devices, \"Eject\" additionally physically ejects the media.\n\nA: The main differences are the following:\nUnmount\nThis option will \"literally\" unmount the device/partition and it applies normally (In Nautilus) to hard drives, be them, internal or external. Is not common to see it for Flash Drives / Pen Drives / Thumb Drives / SD Card / Digital Camera and any other device that needs to sync before powering down.\nThis is not the recommended way of doing it when addressing a device that needs to power down first if your intention is to disconnect the device afterwards, as the device will still show in the Nautilus panel..\nHave in mind that unmount gives you the ability to mount the device again (since it did not power down or actually eject the device from the system).\nEject / Eject Button\nSomehow similar to Unmount, it will unmount the device/partition. The problem is that this option should only be present for Optical Devices (Devices that do not need to sync data before disconnecting) since this actually EJECTS the device. I mean literally ejects or opens your CD Drive/DVD Drive Device so you can take the CD/DVD out of it, physically speaking.\nYou will not be able to mount the device again, except if you insert the CD/DVD back in (With Optical devices) or remove and reinsert the USB Drive again (For Flash Drives and other similar devices). Since this option also appears for USB Drives, and CD/DVD Drives behave differently than USB Drives (Hard Drives and Pen Drives in this case, Optical devices are omitted), ejecting a not properly synced USB Drive (Flash Drive or Hard Drive) could cause problems.\nThere is however a verification process that runs when you try to Eject a device that needs sync. For example, if you try to eject a device that is copying data at that precise moment, it will give you the following warning:\n\nIf you try to Eject the device and the sync is not done yet, you will get a message along the lines of \"waiting for sync to finish before ejecting device\". This only shows or at least it gives you enough time to see the message if you copy a lot files, specially small ones mixed in with big ones and then immediately after finishing the copy process you try to Eject it.\nNote a couple of things:\n\n*\n\n*If you have an USB CD/DVD Drive and you Eject the medium, this will actually eject the whole device. You would have to insert the CD/DVD image back in to make the device appear again.\n\n\n*If you Eject (At least with 12.04 and 12.10, haven't tested older versions) a USB Device that needs sync, the Eject process will power down the device AFTER the sync is done. This might be the cause of not seeing the option for \"Safely Remove Drive\".\n\n\n*If you connect a device that has multiple partitions (Like some IPods, N900 Smartphone or other devices that show 2 or more Devices in Nautilus), Eject will only \"eject\" with the device you have selected. It will not work with others until you specifically tell it.\n\n\n*Ejecting a device that has multiple partitions does not work correctly. It does not power down the device correctly so you might have problems or issues.\nSafely Remove Drive\nThis option differs from the others since it is specifically design for synced devices like USB Hard Drives, Pen Drives, etc.. It will sync the device, unmount it and then power it down. This option should be available for devices that need sync, although Eject has taken some of the properties of Safely Remove Drive.\nHere are some pics that show what you can see when you try to disconnect the device:\nAs you can see in this image, a Pen Drive / Flash Drive has the \"Eject\" option\n\nAn external USB Hard Drive has the \"unmount\" option\n\nAn external USB DVD Drive has the \"Eject\" option\n\nUnity Launcher showing an \"Eject Parent Drive\" option on a multi-partitioned Pen Drive (Has 2 partitions in this case)\n\nA 2 partition created pen drive\nBasically what we should see is this:\nUnmount - For Hard Drives\nEject - For Optical Drives\nSafely Remove - For USB Drives that need sync and power down (Pen Drives for example)\nShould be noted that Unity Launcher shows options differently than Nautilus. GPARTED or the Disk App also show differently than Nautilus.\n", "Q: How to resolve 'gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.h: No such file or directory' I am trying to compile chromium source on ubuntu 10.10.

In 10.10 it seems that the gdk-pixbuf includes are stored in their own directory off of /usr/include, whereas in previous versions they had been lumped in with gtk-2.0. If you have installed libgtk2.0-dev and libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev then you'll need to execute:\nsudo ln -s /usr/include/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/gdk-pixbuf /usr/include/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf\n\nThis will create a symbolic link to the new gdk-pixbuf directory where it had been located previously.\n\nA: You have gdkpixbuf.h, which is not the same as gdk-pixbuf.h.  Note the dash, they are two different files.\ngreyfade is probably correct in you needing that package greyfade mentions, you should probably install libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev as well since gdk-pixbuf.h is in the libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev package.\nDoing an \"aptitude build-dep chromium-browser\" should download all of the development packages you need to manually install the chromium-browser source package for 10.10.

If I install Ubuntu on hard drive A and mount (via nautilus) hard drive B that has Windows 7 installed on it with a RAID1, could Ubuntu even remotely screw up the RAID Controller?

If the RAID is not recognized (and thus the Windows partition isn't seen), I wouldn't try to use it...\n\nA: From the looks of it, I can't tell if you've used up your Fake RAID volumes free space.

I was wondering if it was possible to export anything built in Inkscape to inDesign CS or CS5. If it is possible, how can I get it to work? \n\nA: You can import EPS files into inDesign. In Inkscape go to file > save as, then choose EPS from the dropdown menu.\nIn inDesign, go to file > place and choose your exported EPS.\n\nA: There is also another file format that works well for exporting to InDesign, it is PDF,\nto save as PDF, select file > save as, then choose Portable Document Format(.*pdf) from the drop down menu. \nPDF documents can be placed in InDesign. Even If you choose to combine PDFs as a single document individual pages can be placed from this document in InDesign.\n\nA: According to Adobe [1], InDesign does not support importing SVG files. It does, however, support importing EPS files, which Inkscape can export to (just choose EPS from the drop-down box in the \"Save as ...\" dialog).\n\nA: The best way is if you have also Illustrator on your computer. You can Ctrl+C,Ctrl+V from Inkscape to Illustrator and then Ctrl+C,Ctrl+V from Illustrator to InDesign. You will get fully editable graphics.\n\nA: As far as I remember Photoshop can import SVG.

I know exactly what you are going through.  I've been down that road of frustration.  I tried everything in the repos and everything I could manage to successfully compile.  One app stood out above them all: OpenShot.

Use only direct source if possible with clips.\n\n*Do not use clips that are too long.\n\n*Do not move clips outside of you project folder, or you will disable your project.\n\n*Buy some RAM if you've been putting it off.  It will smooth things out.\n\n*If you notice something out of the ordinary with the program itself, save then, and see if the bug goes away, or to go back to your last save.  Otherwise if you continue to work, there is a potential for loss of work.\n\n*Keep a processor monitor up while you work, and if you apply an operation that consume lots of processor percentage, wait till it's done.  I'm impatient and multi-task and crashed OpenShot because I tried to apply too many operations that had a heavy load all too close to one another.\n\n*Make sure you are up to date on your codecs!\n\n\nWith that in mind, some of the other editors would not even start or crash once a clip was added, or just flat out not work.

I'm (re)installing Ubuntu on my Toshiba NB100 netbook (Intel Atom, 120GB HD, 2GB RAM). Already have a partition I call \"Stuff\" with all my media and docs. Will be deleting the one I had Win7 on (making it the swap), and then there is a recovery one.\nHow big a swap partition should I create?\n\nA: Usually it should be equal to your RAM which makes it 2GB which should be enough for day to day applications.\n\nA: See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\nHere is an excerpt:\n\nHow much swap do I need?\nFor less than 1GB of physical memory (RAM), it's highly recommended that the swap space should, as a base minimum, be equal to amount of RAM. Also, it's recommended that the swap space is maximum twice the amount of RAM depending upon the amount of hard disk space available for the system because of diminishing returns. \nFor more modern systems (>1GB), if you use hibernation, your swap space should minimum be equal to your physical memory (RAM) size, otherwise you need a minimum of round(sqrt(RAM)) and a maximum of twice the amount of RAM. The only downside to having more swap space than you will actually use is the disk space you will be reserving for it.\nThe \"diminishing returns\" means that if you need more swap space then twice your RAM size, you'd better add more RAM as Hard Disk Drive (HDD) access is about 10³ slower then RAM access, so something that would take 1 second, suddenly takes more than 15 minutes! And still more than a minute on a fast Solid State Drive (SSD).\n\nA: For a netbook, you'll probably want to be able to hibernate the computer.  The process of hibernation requires that all the data¹ in RAM be written out to the hard disc, in swap, which means that it's a good idea to have at least as much swap space as RAM.  If you don't need to hibernate the computer you won't need that much swap.\nNow, the trick is that this swap space doesn't actually have to be a dedicated swap partition.  Like Windows, the kernel can use swap files on your regular filesystem², and they're just as fast as a swap partition.  It's much easier to add more swap with a swap file than to re-partition, though.  See the FAQ from this answer for instructions on how to add swap files.\nSo, in short, don't worry about how much swap you need; if you need more, you can easily add it.\n¹: This is not quite true - before writing the data in RAM to swap, the kernel will remove from memory everything that it can.  This will generally include a lot of program code (because the kernel can just read it back from the disc) and all the disc cache, etc.\n²: This capability is actually filesystem-dependent.  Most linux filesystems support having swap files on them - ext4, which is the default, certainly does.  The new btrfs filesystem is an exception, so if you're playing with that you'll need a swap partition.\n\nA: I think a rule said \n- for 1 gb or less of RAM swap must be the double of the RAM.\n- more than 1 gb you dont need to use more than 2 gb of swap.\n\nA: swap area can be seen as a virtual ram for your Linux System. it is basically used when the physical memory (RAM) is full. and if the system needs more memory resources, then the inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. generally, swap should be half the size of the physical memory. 2GB is enough size for the swap if the RAM is 4GB. it would be more than enough if the Size of swap is equal to or more than the RAM.\n", "Q: What are the differences between the git and git-core packages? Why there is a git package and a git-core package? Is there any difference?\n\nA: The git-core package is a \"dummy\" package, which has the git package as dependency.

I had promissed my 120 students that I will install ubuntu 10.10 on their laptops but failed to do it.The laptops were dell vostro 4014. All have same hardware. I took one laptop and installed ubuntu and  all the necessary packages, and also wine to run some windows software. I selected the default ext4 file system. \nThen I tried to use clonezilla server to clone the installation. Clonezilla server shows boot menu splash screen, but later on it says that I might be having a latest NIC unsupported by the kernel. But the NIC of the laptop on which I had installed ubuntu works fine.  Later I tried to use the clonezilla live cd to boot the laptop which has ubuntu. But when I press 'Y' to start cloning, it says 'something went wrong'. Again I tried the 'dd' command to save as disk image. But it copies empty space. So it is not feasible for me as it takes really long time. \nI have made my students to wait for many days, daily they are coming and asking whether my setup is ready. Today I realized I can't do it. I have in a way convinced them not to go for windows. So they are waiting for me to have ubuntu installed on their laptops. Today evening some of them will come to collect the laptops I took from them to install ubuntu. Don't know how and what to tell them.\n\nA: Preparation:\n\n\n*\n\n*change /etc/fstab on your gold-client (the one you prepared), by replacing UUIDs with device names (/dev/sda1 and /dev/sda5 on each device).\n\n\nOn each machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu directly on each machine.\n\n*Replicate your configuration with: rsync -avx --exclude=/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules --exclude=/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules --exclude=/etc/hostname --exclude=/etc/hosts --exclude=/etc/X11/xorg.conf --delete-after root@${host}:/ / (replace ${host} with the ip address of your machine in the network.\n\n*grub-install /dev/sda\n\n*update-grub\n\n*reboot\nAs what to tell the students, \"Sorry, I thought I could install all machines, but I needed more time, want to help?\". Explain the steps and help them learn.\n", "Q: If you tried to use Ubuntu then went back to your old OS, why did you do so? Over the past few years I've been dipping in and out of Ubuntu every so often because I believe in the idea. However, there have always been factors that have made me give up and return to either Windows or OS X, intending to come back when Ubuntu has had a bit more time to 'bake'.\nAnecdotally, if you have had similar experiences, why did you go back? \nIf we can address these sorts of issues, maybe Ubuntu can get over this hump. I mean 'chasm'. \n\nA: As a design professional I can say why I keep getting back to Mac OS for some of my work. Although Ubuntu has some great and powerful graphic design tools (primarily GIMP and Inkscape, which can practically replace Photoshop and Illustrator, and also Blender for 3D work), there are some areas that are still lacking somewhat:\n\n\n*\n\n*Video editing and post-production. There are some good software packages around (kdenlive, pitivi), but they're nowhere near in terms of capabilities to apps like AfterEffects or Final Cut pro. Multi-comp editing, 3D environment, general operations on objects and cameras, plug-in availability, only to name a few.\n\n*Animation. Simply nothing interesting and capable out there (hope someone can prove me wrong!). Blender is great for advanced 3D stuff, but if I need to put together a simple stop motion or line-art animation, I have to go back to Flash, AfterEffects or other tools.\n\n*Compatibility. Whether we like it or not, Adobe packages are the industry standard. When collaborating with other designers, there's often no alternative to using AI's, PSD's, etc.\nWondering if other designers working with Ubuntu have similar experience.\n\nA: 2006: I went back to Windows for my home PC after a stint with Ubuntu because I was mainly using Ubuntu as a media centre, but my specialised wireless mouse (with play/pause/rewind buttons on it) didn't work (without my figuring out how to compile, hack C, and install drivers)\n\nA: I've always had trouble with my ATi graphics cards when using Ubuntu, I find that the performance I get is substandard for my hardware, because of this I return to Windows to get the most out of my machine.  I've recently upgraded to a NVidia card, so I will try Ubuntu again.\n\nA: I have been trying to use Ubuntu on a very recent MacBook Pro. Apple does good hardware, especially if you compare screen size to weight (that is a 17\"). Every now and then I update Ubuntu with the hope that things work better and when some do, others break.\nIn general I guess the reason it is because is not so well tested on those machines (which also, because of the price, are not the most popular), so I guess it comes to individuals, me included, testing it, often, on their machines and report bugs.\nSo also here, like all the chasm story, is a bit chicken->egg, if the platform is not stable for some users, those won't switch to it. Mac users tend also to be pretty spoiled (if you spend different $Ks on a computer, chances are you don't want to put so much effort to make it work).\n\nA: I moved to Ubuntu in my teenage years. Only a few times have I ever gone back to Windows;\n\n\n*\n\n*To test out a super-nasty bit of malware that mainly used psychological tricks for class.\n\n*To play STEAM (bought a load of games through there)\n\n*My old bank (now updated FINALLY) wanted IE...6 (I know, it's shameful) for internet banking.\n\n*To play ORBITER; a finer flight/space simulator I haven't found (and which, despite being freeware, does not seem to move to Linux anytime soon)\nI do still have another laptop with XP and STEAM on it. I use it whenver I'm utterly bored. Right now it's gathering dust under my bed. Shows you how much I like Ubuntu :P\n\nA: A dial-up internet connection (with a WinModem) and an incompatible Lexmark printer were my obstacles.  Switching to broadband and an HP printer fixed my troubles.\n\nA: I first heard about Linux in 1998, I dual booted RedHat 5 and Windows 98. But ran into problems with Linux, while it was a interesting OS, I couldn't get much done because of modem issues. This was before broadband and getting the modem to work was not like just connecting ethernet to the computer. After a few times of installing, I finally gave up and stuck with Windows. \nA few years later I got broadband and gave Linux another go, I think I used Mandrake 3, which was much more usable and was able to access the Interent. I did some researching, checked on IRC channels, but other than that, I really liked to play games and with only one computer, made it difficult. After destroying a few dual boot setups, including loosing all of my data, I decided aganist dual booting. :)\nSince then, I have used Linux for some slower computers at home, but it wasn't until my last job where I really found Linux important. I was given a budget of no money and asked to create a method to block users from accessing youtube. The network engineer tried to block it by creating rules in the firewall appliance but needless to say, youtube has many many ip addresses. After searching possible Windows based solutions, I found a tutorial about setting up Squid. \nIt was in a few hours that I had a complete proxy server running, complete with reports and blocking youtube completely. It really brought up how important FOSS is and how people offering their time writing tutorials and support can make such a difference. At that point, I became much more interested not only in Linux but also Open Source software in general. Being a Windows admin for years it was hard to really understand how something that is Open Source can work as well as a closed source version but cost thousands of dollars less. \nNow at home, I'm running Linux on my main laptop, and planning to switch over my second laptop, then my main workstation. The second laptop hasn't switched over because it's plays Netflix to my tv, and the workstation is using for gaming, and Adobe LightRoom. \nI guess my point here is when you switch from one OS to another, you should understand what to expect. Some people think of Linux as a complete system that will work just like Windows and offer the same applications. It's close but there's a learning curve as with any new OS, and you will need to understand that your favorite apps might not be available, but a close version will be. Keeping that in mind, has made my current install of 10.04 much more enjoyable. There are times when I'm missing a function in Gimp and want to switch over to Photoshop but I get around the hurdle and surprise myself with a new tool or trick. \n\nA: I just tried Ubuntu 10.10  for about 3 weeks and finally gave up and went back to Windows 7 Pro.   The reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The remote desktop performance was terrible compared to Microsoft RDP.\n\n*Sharing a folder using Nautilus was not easy enough to figure out and had a bug preventing the share once I did figure it out.\n\n*The performance of Nautilus was just slow enough to drive me nuts.  I am spoiled by Windows Exploder.\n\n*Firestarter  could be a tiny bit easier to use IMHO.\n\n*Always having to use sudo or gksudo.  Windows saves me time but not having to do that stuff.\n\n*Always had to enter admin password to mount WIFI device after boot.  Windows never requires me to do that.\n\n\nThings I liked:\n 1.  Samsung WIFI Printer was easier to setup than on windows.... but just barely.\n 2.  The app menu but Windows 7 is easily keeping up in this area.\n 3.  The implementation in Gnome3 of the \"Stardock Fences\" type of feature. Nice.\n\nA: I've been using Windows as a super user since around 1988...! I love WinXP more than any other OS ever made. I worked for MS for 5 years. And yet, today my long-term goal is to raise my kids on Linux. \nBut ... when switching one computer to Linux, any problems cause friction in my family: typical discussion points are\nWhy do I have to be different; what's the point; but it worked just fine before. \nBottom line: The most important aspect is (lack of) seamless integration into a Windows-based home environment. That's what sent me back to Windows every time.\nDuring the past decade I've had several attempts at switching to Linux. My first attempt was Red Hat and it was just ridiculous; I felt like a stone age man in a spaceship.  It's fine that distros have advanced uses, but those just aren't for novices. \nWith my more recent attempts, with Ubuntu and PCLinuxOS, there were two major problems that always sent me back to my beloved WinXP: hardware support (Nvidia and audio); and poor integration into a Windows-based home network (file shares). I am aware that I can't expect exactly the same software; only other software for the same purpose. I think many people don't really understand that small difference, and they become disappointed. \nGraphics:\nOn every computer ever used, I never got the Nvidia card to work with my monitor. I only found out this week(!) that the problem wasn't Nvidia itself but rather that my monitor didn't send proper EDID signals back to the computer. Once I learned to define the monitor's specs in xorg.conf, the issue was solved. Oddly, I never had that problem on Windows (with the same monitor) so I had no clue that it was the culprit.\nWell, it's a lesson learned, but it cost an unreasonable amount of forum posts, failed attempts, frustration, and unhappiness. I think it's significant to observe that my install only succeeded after the launch of askubuntu.com...\nNetwork:\nThis is still an outstanding issue - my desktop computer is in a pure Windows environment, and it's the printing host for the family. It's essential that all the home's computers can browse each other's (Windows) file shares, and that they can print. If I can't make file&print sharing work, I am forced back to Windows - again. So this attempt at Ubuntu has not fully won me over yet.\nSetting up a share in Ubuntu that a Windows computer can read&write is very complicated to figure out for a Windows user. Also, getting access to Windows shares from Ubuntu is just as complicated. I always run into problems with missing user accounts and access permissions.\nIdeally, everything will end up working so well that I would one day be able to convince my wife to switch to Linux too, but that day is still very far off. \nI would also like to switch my media center pc to Linux, but it's not just a player, it also has TV tuners and I have never ever been able to get them to work with any distro - but Windows just works. Digital, analog, EPG, everything; using only a for-dummies onscreen setup wizard. I need that kind of quality on Linux before the media center will move from Windows, and I just don't see that coming.\nUbuntu has made a tremendous difference for novices in the Linux world. Before Ubuntu, there was nothing that was seriously approachable for novices. With the last 2-3 years' releases of Ubuntu, things have become so fantastic that reasonably experienced pc users can have a go at Ubuntu and not crash&burn as I did with Red Hat. That's remarkable! While it's not actually mainstream just yet, the past few years indicate that \"mainstream\" is a realistic goal not many years away. Just look at how awesome the Software Center is: search for anything and you'll find not one but several choices, each of which is free and installs in seconds, no reboot needed. Wow!\n\nA: I stumbled a couple of times but mainly because I think I started on Ubuntu for the wrong reason. I've always been a geek and that has drawn me to Linux in general over the past 10 years with some quick stints on Mandriva and then Fedora, none of them lasting longer than a week on my computer.\nEach time I'd load up the latest and greatest, see that everything was cool, have a fight with Amarok, play a game of Klondike and finally when I needed to get something done, I'd drop back to Windows.\nI think it's very important you recognise that you perform tasks with your computer and if you don't plan ahead and see what you're going to be using (or find the workaround to see if/how you can keep using what you are now) you quickly find out that though it may look nice or have a nice feature, you haven't got a clue how to get your work done.\nAnd then I became a professional ASP.NET developer. This halted my switchover for a couple of years. Mono was a wink in the milkman's eye and I really loved Visual Studio .NET 2002 (and 2003 and still love them today - they were great applications)... After I left that company, I found myself slowly spreading out over other technologies. \nAs a web developer (now freelance) I still had to deploy websites but I had the choice over what systems to use. I started a Dreamhost account for hosting various things (mostly media for my main ASP.NET written blog) but this gave me some exposure to the console. It wasn't long before I was writing fairly complicated bash scripts to automate things for me.\nBut just over three years ago, in the middle of all this and despite the Linux exposure, I declared myself \"a Windows enthusiast\". I had a workflow that worked and I just didn't care to switch to something that delivered pretty poor driver support (as it still was back then, especially with the dodgy support for ATI graphics cards) and none of the applications I needed on a daily basis. \nI was still developing in ASP.NET but I did keep wanting to switch. I'd boot a LiveCD and test it out for a few hours but while I was still using ASP.NET and a FakeRAID chip that didn't work under Linux, I still couldn't justify moving over completely. Eventually my PHP had improved enough to use it for developing sites so most of my new work was through that. This was also about the time that VirtualBox started up and VMWare's desktop virtualisation was also getting quite usable...\nAnd some bits of Vista were wearing me down and by autumn 2007, I changed my graphics to Nvidia and I was back at square one on my migration to Linux: Compiz blew my socks off. It was another silly \"oh noes thaz too pretteh\" migration that would have been doomed if it weren't for the pieces that had been put in place over the year:\n\n\n*\n\n*My workflow was now nearing platform independence\n\n*I could run 3D things on my computer because I'd ripped out my ATI x800XT\n\n*My mass-storage was still an issue. If I wanted anything from it, I had to boot to windows, copy it onto a non-RAID drive and boot back into Linux...\n\n*I found one application that I realised I kept coming back for: Amarok. It was miles ahead of anything available for Windows\n\n\nI still missed Windows. Not just the applications but how some things like how the Vista start menu worked, the simplicity of Explorer and the robustness of XP's Solitaire... \nBut for the things I missed I learned either to fix it (I moved my RAID to mdadm, moved Windows applications to VirtualBox and Wine), put up with it (the gnome menu is still as poor but I only use it now when gnome-do doesn't find something) or go without (there are dozens of games I own but can't play and more that I can play but don't work as well as a native install).\nThere is still an element of sacrifice if you really use your computer to get things done. Having documented half the pain of migrating over the years, if I could send it all back to myself in mid-2007, I couldn't guarantee I wouldn't just run away.\n\nA: 2010: I was working on Etherpad using Ubuntu. I gave up because Eclipse didn't work properly. When moving from Windows to Mac OS, the fact that Eclipse worked on a Mac made the transition far less scary as I knew at least I'd have something familiar to get work done with while I learned everything else. \n\nA: One of the main reasons I don't use Ubuntu on all of my computers is that Ubuntu does not have a rolling release branch.\n\nA: I used to switch back-and-forth to Windows because of needing TeamSpeak (the TeamSpeak 2 port was lousy), but that issue has since been solved. TeamSpeak 3 had a native client.\n\nA: keyboard/mouse/screen freeze regularly only cured by hard reboot in V. 10.04 & 10.10. Using Dell dimension desktop Celeron processor. I have been single booting Ubuntu on this computer since V. 5. I find dozens of similar complaints but no fixes when I surf for answers. Went back to 9.10 with no problems after several hours.\n\nA: I had been flirting with a few distros of Linux over the past decade, and always came back to the same thing, network and modem support. Until recently, I had nothing but issues with connecting my home equipment to the net. \nTo clarify, I do not see this as a failing to anything but my own technical competence on Linux. However, as a new, and willing, user, it was always the show stopper. \nA few years ago I attempted Ubuntu, and even had some success with an ndiswrapper for a wireless usb receiver, however in the end gave up.\nFortunately, Ubuntu has got to the stage where I can get online with all my equipment as a novice user, and I can now start learning and improving my Linux skills.\nApart from the fact I am a .NET developer, and need to operate Windows for my bread and butter, I now live a totally Ubuntu existence.\nAs for Mac, I used it a lot when I was an audio engineer, however now find it annoyingly patronizing. Why, I am not sure, it just irritates me :)\n\nA: Sound. I never got it to work satisfactorily on Linux. I can't live without music...\n\nA: I'm not switching back to Windows. I can do most of my work in Ubuntu, but there are several things I can't (yet) do with it, so here I go with my personal (but surely shared with many others) list:\n\n\n*\n\n*CAD software (specifically AutoCAD): there's no software yet that (imho) can become a real alternative for this. It's also true that a lot of personalisation during years (menus, toolbars, Lisp and VBA apps and routines) makes it harder for me to change to other software, but I'd give it a try if there was a good quality application, with dwg support (and this is a major drawback, as at least in my area, dwg has become a de facto standard)\n\n*Structural Engineering and construction budgeting software. Same as above, afaik.\n\n*Minor annoyances: some organizations (specifically my professional assocition) still force me to use IE, because their web interface won't work with another one.\n\n\nMaybe I'll update my list later on.... but these are the reasons that force me to use W7 still. What I'm doing right now is virtualizing it in my desktop and dual booting in my laptop (as it has no hardware virtualization support, so VM's won't work smoothly enough)\n\nA: I now have been using Ubuntu full time for 2.5 yrs. Previous to that I had installed and un-installed linux twice. Both the times it was due to lack of drivers. First time it was Modem drivers (in 2003-2004) and second time it was WiFi (in 2006). Both the time this lack of drivers meant I had to switch to Windows to use internet which made it difficult for me to find out how to install the drivers. Coz it was too much work to start Windows, find the drivers/method, start Linux and find that the given method is not working and then again start windows and so on.\nSo first thing, other than the basic system, that needs to be working in fresh Linux install is internet because without internet there is no help. So ethernet/wifi/dongle/modem drivers are most important :)\n\nA: I rarely use my computer for games, but when the itch strikes I'm thankful for my old winxp license.\nMore frequently I'm tempted back to Slackware, or right now, tempted to try ArchLinux. I love Ubuntu for the ease of install and the package system. Updating gnome is ridiculously easy compared to my attempt several years ago on Slackware when I ran into dependency hell in the midst of ./configure && make && make install.\nMy frustration with Ubuntu is that it's increasingly difficult to manage my system with the command line. Slackware encouraged understanding and tweaking configuration files. Ubuntu's goal is to be good enough that the user doesn't need to know those files exist. It's an admirable goal, but it leads to situations where my custom console-keymap file is overwritten every. single. update.\nOr the pulseaudio situation. I haven't found a nice looking functional gui volume control. I haven't found any cli volume control. Alsamixer of course has basic controls, but it isn't aware of per application volume levels. It's hard to get consistent volume levels.\nOr that Ubuntu is so dependent on Gnome for gui utilities. I hate using Gnome. It looks beautiful, compiz impresses me more than win7, and I would definitely recommend it to the casual user. But me, I prefer Blackbox, or Wmfs. Which means it's extremely difficult to access wired and wireless network configurators among other utilities. My favourite (fixed now) was a few releases ago, launching Nautilus launched the entire Gnome desktop.\nOr that Ubuntu updates are slowly filling up my 16gB netbook.\nI could go on. Some of my annoyances will probably become questions here. I like Ubuntu a lot. I can't overstate how much I love having huge repositories of gpl software that I can install with a couple clicks or a simple command. But Ubuntu as a whole isn't perfect, and the package system might not be enough to keep me in the Ubuntu flavour of linux.\n\nA: At the moment I use a mixture of Ubuntu and Linux Mint however initially I had difficulty making the transition to Ubuntu and linux in general because I was worried about what would happen to my working machine. Also at the time April 2009 most of the flavours of linux I tried at the time were just to unstable at the time mainly because of graphics problems.\nHowever that was until the Karmic Koala changed everything I have never gone back since then, finding that I will work harder for freedom of choice than for the money to pay for no choice... and you can quote me on that. \n\nA: It is too bloated. I don't want all that software it comes with nor do I want graphical UIs for everything. Then again, I'm not really part of Ubuntu's target audience.\nI also dislike how they go about development. They don't always get their patches back upstream (whereas other distros try a lot harder to make sure everything is committed upstream). If I recall they also propose to remove Synaptic from the default install (which is actually a good thing in my opinion but for the target audience, no).\nPackage building is a horrible process (Both RPM and Ebuilds are so much more friendly to create).\nMy largest problem came when everything started becoming Ubuntu branded - first the Software Center (why not send upstream patches to Debian's synaptic?), then Ubuntu One (why can't all of the unix flavors use something like this?).\nNote: I head back to Gentoo/Fedora (Gentoo for desktop, Fedora for laptop due to longer compile times).\n\nA: Ubuntu is soo much more powerful in so many ways. Like being able to run it off an external drive. I carry one around with ubuntu on it and can use it on any computer with a usb port. However, while I primarily use Ubuntu on my personal laptop I also dual boot so I can use Netflix, DVD fab, Autodesk software and to log into my companies MS accounting software. \nI've been dabbling with linux off and on since the late 90's and used to run a web server with it on a 486 machine because it would. Now that the GUI has grown so much the need for the command line, recompiling the kernal and all the other tedious duties that used to come along with linux are almost completely gone which makes it much more user friendly.\nSupport for ubuntu is second to none because of groups like this. Thank you to all of you!\n\nA: Well, the times I went back to windows is when Ubuntu was into version 7.04 and through 9.04. It was just hard for me to use. And I wasn't a Linux person. I have never heard of it. I used it so I could use something other than Windows XP. After I found out I had to type in commands to install some things I got mad and put Windows XP back on my computer. I went back and forth when they made new versions. Finally when Ubuntu 10.04 came out I was really pleased. I have been using ever since. A couple of times I went back to Windows because of school things but then I finally went back and I am happy!\n\nA: I went back from Ubuntu 11.10 to Linux Mint 9 because of stability and responsiveness. Linux Mint 9 is 30-60% faster in absolutely all tasks, including virtualboxs...\nWell, I just made a second partition, and I use more the Ubuntu 11.10 than the Mint 9, but I can't really realize why... hmm kind of lol. \n", "Q: How do I install the empathy smilies (from maverick) in Pidgin?

The main difference afaict is that the application name, which usually shows up in the window's title bar does not show up in the upper tray.  I'm sure this is a bug/oversight in i-a-m (which I will now submit a bug report on), but it's an important part of what globalmenu does.  It tells you which application has the focus.\nStill, it's nice to see i-a-m in Maverick and I'll be switching my desktops over to it.\n\nA: This page hosts the maintainers' official documentation on installing globalmenu.\nHowever, according to this issue, globalmenu doesn't compile at all in 10.10 and the project seems to be inactive. Here's the error in the attached buildlog. You may want to try and fix the issue yourself :)\n\nA: If you just want the effect of global menu. Install the package \"indicator-applet-appmenu\". This is the new appmenu used in the Ubuntu Netbook Edition. It is compatible with the normal Ubuntu session as well.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopExperienceTeam/ApplicationMenu\n\nA: You can add this ppa - deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/globalmenu-team/ppa/ubuntu lucid main manually to your software sources [The distro version is lucid there because they haven't updated their PPA to provide maverick packages, yet. But it doesn't matter. I've installed it on my system and its working perfect.] and use this command - sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnome-globalmenu gnome-applet-globalmenu.

Now log out and go back to the graphical login-screen (CTRL+ALT+F7 or F8 or F9) and try again.\n\nA: If you have a livecd, can you run a disk check (from the command line) on the disk?\nI've had systems do this before because of bad permissions, and a simple disk check fixed the problem.\n\nA: Autologin worked fine for me, but not afterwards.

They wanted to make sure that whoever wants to stick with the distro's default wallpaper would get updated to the most recent version. \nSince the wallpaper setting is stored in a per-user setting in gconf, it's not possible to assign new wallpapers to users on upgrade, as they (rightly so) don't want to override users' wallpaper settings. \nHence, the only way is to leave the filename alone and change the file the settings point to.\n\nA: Another reason people may care is that for some scenarios, you'd like to change the default wallpaper using command line tools only. It's just very unintuitive to find that you have to \nmv $MYBGIMG warty-final-ubuntu.png\n\ninstead of using something like default-wallpaper (without extension, while we're at it).\n", "Q: What's the best approach to triggering a distro upgrade for an OEM build? The product I develop for work is a customised Ubuntu 8.04 LTS system with a number of back ported packages and a number of our own for the application specific stuff.\nNow that 10.04 has been released it's time to start thinking about how we move our customers towards the latest LTS release. I'm currently considering the best approach to do this, preferably all triggered from a package upgrade.\nI currently have a \"meta\" package which contains a number of prerequisites for our flavour of Ubuntu. I was thinking of issuing updated version of this in our current repo with a few upgrade scripts to be run from postinst. This would trigger the distro upgrade and then switch the custom repo bits to point to the new packages directory built against 10.04.\nIs there a command line for trigger the distro upgrade?\nIs this the best way to proceed?\n\nA: Your postinst could run whatever custom scripts need to happen, and finally, you could trigger the distro upgrade with:\nsed -i 's/hardy/lucid' /etc/apt/sources.list\napt-get update\napt-get install dpkg apt\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nYour scheme could work, with plenty of testing.

There are two more archives inside, you'll need to open \"data.tar.gz\". \n\nA: you can do sudo apt-get -d install nvidia-96 to download package without installation\n\nA: Another alternative:\nsudo aptitude download nvidia-96\n\n\nA: Yes you can. Type the following in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install -d <\"package\" or \"packages\">\n\nHere -d parameter only downloads packages and not install the packages.

The answer of jarno limits the use case to PPAs only, although the question is of general interest. The scripts from Riccardo Murri and Graham Dunn are quite slow due to the repeated apt-cache policy calls (like about 10 minutes runtime).\nSo this is my call solving the general case on a shell being a lot faster (like less than 10 seconds runtime)\napt list --installed 2> /dev/null \\\n  | cut -d/ -f1 \\\n  | parallel -n200 apt-cache policy \\\n  | rg '^(\\S+)[\\s\\S]+?\\* (?:\\S+\\s+){3}(\\S+)' -Uor '$1 $2'\n\napt list --installed gets a list of all installed packages ignoring apt's message about possible future format changes with 2> /dev/null and extracting only the package names with cut by using / as a delimiter with -d/ and returning the first field with -f1.\nThen, apt-cache policy is used to get more information about all the packages. This could be executed with xargs, as apt-cache expects its input as command line argument. As this is the remaining performance-critical part, GNU parallel from package parallel is used instead to run multiple apt-cache processes in parallel looking up 200 packages with each using -n200. Note, that xargs can run multiple commands in parallel, too, but synchronizes output on newline, which is not correct here in general.\nFinally, apt-cache's output is parsed with rg from package ripgrep which is a very fast and multiline capable grep successor with -U allowing to output two regular expression capture groups with -or '$1 $2'. The regular expression captures the package name with ^(\\S+), skips to the last star marking the installed repository with [\\s\\S]+?\\* , then skips three words with (?:\\S+\\s+){3} and finally captures the repository with (\\S+).\n\nA: Open Synaptic Package Manager and click the \"Origin\" button on the bottom of the left sidebar.

It would look quite nice I think. This is how it looks right now:\n\n\nA: Normally, docky's icon is dynamically drawn by the program so that it is colored based on your GTK theme. So, the first thing we need to do is turn that off. Launch the \"Run Application\" dialog by pressing Alt+F2. Then run gconf-editor from that prompt.\nNow browse to /apps/docky-2/Docky/Items/DockyItem/ Select the Hue key and change the setting to 1\n\nNow that docky will use the theme icon directly, you can change the icon in the theme. The theme will be found in /usr/share/icons if it is installed system wide or ~/.icons/ if it is installed locally. \nFor Faenza, you'll want to replace /usr/share/icons/Faenza/apps/scalable/dock.svg with the icon you want. You'll probably want to use /usr/share/icons/Faenza/places/scalable/distributor-logo-ubuntu.svg Depending on the size of your dock, may also need to replace some of the other sizes as well.\n\nYou'll need to restart docky.\n", "Q: How can I setup nightly backups via the command line?

For workstations/toys, my favorite backup utility has got to be deja-dup, just for the straightforwardness and the simplified UI that i can comfortably recommend to my parents (the UI standard by which all applications must be judged :P ). \nFor headless systems, I'd go with rdiff-backup or duplicity, the app that powers deja-dup's backend. \nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/\n\n*http://live.gnome.org/DejaDup\n\n*http://duplicity.nongnu.org/\n", "Q: Install packages without internet How do I install ubuntu packages from the ubuntu cd.

Note the ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere match will let anything in.\nYou'll probably want to add something to /etc/rc.local to call iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules. Be careful you don't lock yourself out of your system, though. :)\n\nA: This is the same question as https://serverfault.com/questions/188550/iptables-nmap-on-ubuntu \nAs people there suggest, your firewall rules have special exceptions for the cloud server itself (-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT) or your \"airtelbroadband\" machine (the script you're running allows all traffic from the selected dyndns IP). \nSo, you need to run nmap from a different IP address (e.g., just use another machine in the cloud)\nIf you want to restrict access from your \"airtelbroadband\" host (e.g., for testing purposes), then you can replace the last line in your script with a list of the rules you want to apply.  For example, the following lines will only allow SSH, HTTP/HTTPS and MySQL connections from your home host:\n$IPTABLES -A $CHAIN -s $IP/32 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n$IPTABLES -A $CHAIN -s $IP/32 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n$IPTABLES -A $CHAIN -s $IP/32 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT\n$IPTABLES -A $CHAIN -s $IP/32 -p tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT\n\nWarning: It is very, very, very easy to lock yourself out of a running host by messing with the firewall rules, especially with automated scripts.

I want to change an icon of a specific theme. Where do themes save their icons?\n\nA: As a supplementary for the accepted answer: If you don't find the ~/.icons directory, there may be a ~/.local/share/icons directory instead (PS: My distro is Ubuntu 16.10).\n\nA: To add to some of the answers here:\nThe freedesktop.org standard requires programs to look for icons in multiple folders in this order:\n\n*\n\n*$HOME/.icons (for backwards compatibility)\n\n*$XDG_DATA_DIRS/icons, which typically just means ~/.local/share/icons.\n\n*/usr/share/pixmaps\nSo if you want a custom icon, your best bet is to find the icon name in /usr/share/pixmaps, and then create an image with that same file name in ~/.local/share/icons.\n\nA: /usr/share/icons/ typically contains pre-installed themes (shared by all users)\n~/.icons/ typically contains folders with the themes installed by the user.\nAlso, many applications have their icons in /usr/share/pixmaps/ or in the folder with the same name as the application under /usr/share/...\n\nA: There are several places: (in bracets some examples)\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/pixmaps/ ( chromium-browser.png display-im6.q16.xpm firefox.png flash-player-properties.png gimp.xpm gvim.svg texstudio.xpm )\n\n*/usr/share/app-install/icons/ ( adobeflashplugin.png julia.svg texmaker.png thunderbird.png vim.svg vlc.png wine.svg grace.svg)\n\n*~/.local/share/icons/ ( soffice.png java-lang-thread.png org-jabref-jabrefmain.png) one of the places where Ubuntu searches for icons, if you use relative path\n\n*/usr/share/icons/... and subfolders ( matlab.png .../hicolor/scalable/apps/chromium-browser.svg .../hicolor/scalable/apps/geany.svg .../hicolor/scalable/apps/okular.svgz .../default.kde4/48x48/apps/acroread.png)\n\n*/usr/share/... just subfolders ( .../vlc/vlc.ico .../gimp/2.0/images/gimp-logo.png ) but this one is more for icons used in the program that the logo of the program\n\n*/snap/... just subfolders ( .../inkscape/3080/meta/gui/inkscape.svg .../languagetool/10/snap/gui/icon.png )\n\n*~/.icons related to freedesktop.org (source1, source2 )\n\nMost of the folders are already announced here, all sources I used:\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/6010/676490\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/43951/676490\n\n*https://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/speicherort-der-desktop-icons/\n\n*Why so many files in /usr/share/app-install/desktop?\n\nA: Globally: /usr/share/icons/\nor in your home folder : ~/.local/share/icons\n", "Q: How to set Monday as the first day of the week in GNOME 2 Calendar applet? What is the recommended way to change the first day of the week to Monday (instead of Sunday, as in the screenshot below)? \n\nI couldn't find anything related in Clock Preferences, nor in System -> Preferences, or System -> Administration.\nThis probably has something to do with tweaking locales, so here's (possibly relevant) output from locale:\nLANG=en_US.utf8\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.utf8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.utf8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.utf8\"\n...\nLC_ALL=\n\nNB: I want to keep English as the UI language both in GNOME and on command line. Dates are currently displayed like this (e.g. ls -l): 2010-10-06 15:32, and I also want to keep that as it is. \n\nA: Here's another solution, also from Ubuntu Forums. I think this is somewhat cleaner and more robust: it doesn't involve customizing Ubuntu's locale files (only settings that you're supposed to edit).\n\nGnome calendar applet adheres to your\nlocale settings. In Ubuntu, you can\nassign locale components by editing\nthe file /etc/default/locale. Here is\nwhat I've got there:\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\n\nWhich means: I want software messages\nin American, but time, paper size and\nunits in British i.e.weeks starting\nwith Mondays, A4, metric.\n\nProps to artm who posted that!\nOf course, LC_TIME=\"en_GB.UTF-8\" is the relevant setting to get weeks to start on Mondays.\nYou need to log out and back in for the change to take effect.\n\nA: Based on this page, the settings should go in .pam_environment or .profile\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables#A.2BAH4ALw.pam_environment\nMy default .profile is sourcing .bashrc so I added these lines to my .bashrc since I already have it under source control.\n#Change first day of week to Monday\nexport LC_TIME=en_GB.UTF-8\n#Change to metric system\nexport LC_MEASUREMENT=en_GB.UTF-8\n\nI'm running 14.04.1\n\nUPDATE: 01/15/16 Ubuntu 14.04.03\nHaving these lines in my .bashrc stopped working earlier this year. \nMoving the same lines to either .pam_environment or .profile does work.  This is a user setting, not system-wide.\n\nA: For me the advice at https://wired-mind.info/post/528 worked.\nEdit the file /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_US\nsudo nano /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_US\n\nFind this section:\nweek 7;19971130;7 \n\nfirst_weekday   1 \n\nfirst_workday   2\n\nSet first_weekday to equal 2.\nSave and exit the file, then perform:\nsudo locale-gen\n\nIn my case locale-gen regeneration was important to start to see the change.\n\nA: For me the easiest way was to update formats in Region & Language\nGo to Settings->Region & Language and choose your format. \nThe system will force you to logoff and login to reflect the changes.\n\n\nA: The best solution for me is to do this on a per-user basis in my own home directory. That way I don't have to edit a system-wide file. (Of course if you want this setting for all of the users on your system you are obviously forced to edit system files.)\nWhat I do is edit the file ~/.xsessionrc to contain the line \"export LC_TIME=en_GB.utf8\". That's it.\n\nA: The time and date formats in Ubuntu (tried 12.x) are controlled by the locale settings. First you need to find out the current locale being used to control your time and date settings. Open a terminal and enter the following command.\nlocale | grep LC_TIME\n\nYou should see a result that looks something like\nLC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8\n\nChange to the locale directory and copy the current locale file to create a new custom file. Adjust the for your locale.\ncd /usr/share/i18n/locales\nsudo cp en_US en_US_custom\n\nNow edit the new custom file.\nsudo gedit en_US_custom\n\nAnd change\nfirst_weekday 1\n\nto\nfirst_weekday 2\n\nThen make the change in /etc/environment to point to your new custom file.\nsudo gedit /etc/environment\n\nAdd a line like this to the bottom of the file making sure to adjust it for the custom locale file you want to use.\nLC_TIME=\"en_US_custom.UTF-8\"\nSource: http://tuxtweaks.com/2008/12/change-the-week-start-day-in-ubuntu/\n\nA: On Ubuntu 12.04 (and later versions I suppose), the easiest way seems to be: System Settings > Language Support, then click on Regional Formats tab and choose from the drop-down list.\nIn my case I chose \"English (Ireland)\" which gave me Monday as first day in the calendar, \"correct\" number formats and currency, and other goodies :)\nIf you don't find the right option there, you might need to install a language (the other tab of the same window).\n\nA: This is already a very old topic, I added this answers as reference to future readers looking for the same problem but want a way with less hacking\nUse en_DK as locale.\nThis locale was developed as an official way of writing English in Denmark but it is  used outside Denmark, as some sort of generic continental European English locale. It solves the most annoying problems with en_US and does not require any modification of system files. If a more fine tuned solution in desired - the other answers are excellent. \n\nA: Setting first_weekday in locale\nFirst, determine which time locale is in use. The system wide setting in /etc/default/locale may or may not be overwritten in ~\\.pam_environment.\n$ cat ~\\.pam_environment\n…\nLC_TIME=en_IE.UTF-8\n…\n\nHere, the locale en_IE.UTF-8 appears to be in use.\nNow, edit the locale source file with administrator privileges.\nThe editor vim is used here, but this can be replaced by, say nano.\n$ sudo vim /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_IE\n\nAdd the following lines and save the modified locale source file.\nfirst_weekday  2\nfirst_workday  2\n\nFinally, regenerate the locale files with the following command:\n$ sudo locale-gen\n\nLog out and in again for this change to take effect.\n\nA: I just want to note, that the default user folder for setting the locale is: ~/.config/locale.conf. It may be different if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set to something else. As pointed out earlier, the system config /etc/default/locale is used as a fallback value.\nSetting LC_TIME=\"en_GB.UTF-8\" is sufficient. You do not need to set the other variables in order to get the week starting day correct.\n\nA: None of the answers worked for me perfectly. Changing \"/etc/default/locale\" did not work at all. In settings I did not have my needed format. And after changing \".pam_environment\", my \"LC_TIME\" changed to default \"C\" locale. I tried \"sudo locale-gen\", but it did not generate my necessary locale. So I had to force it with command \"sudo locale-gen lv_LV.UTF-8\". And after restart everything started to work correctly.\n\nA: Just open the terminal in the folder:\n/etc/default\nand use:\nsudo update-locale LC_TIME=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nand restart\nsource:\n-first answer\nand\n-https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Configure_Locales_in_Ubuntu\n", "Q: How to get Docky to work like gnome-do? Is there a way to get Docky ton act like Gnome-Do? I installed just the docky package. I would like it to be able to search for other things that are not in the dock. Is this possible or would it just be easier to install Gnome-Do separate.\n\nA: Lucid's version of Gnome-Do still has the Docky interface available, and it will act like Gnome-Do when you push the keyboard shortcut for Gnome-Do. You shouldn't even need to have Docky installed separately. The version in Maverick removed the Docky interface. (Both are numbered 0.8.3.1 in the about dialog, however.)\nOnce you have a version of Gnome-Do without Docky removed (see below), the next thing is to run Gnome-Do. If Gnome-Do doesn't pop up when you run it, summon it with Windows Key + Space. Click the downward-pointing triangle on the top right corner of Gnome-Do and click Preferences. Click on the Appearance tab and select the Docky theme in the drop-down at the top of the tab. You can then configure Gnome-Do just as you would configure Docky.\nThe versions of the gnome-do packages after 0.8.3.1+dfsg-1ubuntu1 (0.8.3.1+dfsg-2 and 0.8.3.1+dfsg-2ubuntu1) removed the Docky theme. Maverick is also missing the gnome-do-docklets package.\nYou could download gnome-do and gnome-do-docklets from the Ubuntu Lucid repositories (you could probably still install Maverick's version of gnome-do-plugins with it). It looks like the only fix you'd miss out on is one for crashes caused by GNOME Keyring. I'm not experienced enough to guarantee this will work right, but I'd do it on my own computer. I have at least checked to ensure there aren't any dependency issues.\nA surer, but more difficult, approach, would be to build the latest release of gnome-do but reverse the effects of the patch debian/patches/03_disable_docky.dpatch.\n\nA: For now, you'll need to install them separately and use them without integration; Docky was split from Do a while ago. The next Do release will likely reintroduce Docky integration.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force a specific file to exist in RAM only? I like this suggestion of mounting a tmpfs at /var/log in order to reduce disk writes.\nIs there any way to do something similar for just a single file such as ~/.xsession-errors?\n\nMy incentive for asking comes from PowerTOP,\nThe program 'gnome-do' is writing to file '.xsession-errors' on /dev/sdb2.\nThis prevents the disk from going to powersave mode.\n\nbut one could also conceivably want to do this in order to speed up an IO-intensive program.\n\nA: No, there is no way you can force a single file not to be written to disk.  Writes to a file are passed down to the filesystem code: if the filesystem is backed by memory (e.g., tmpfs) then data is written to a (virtual) memory location; if the filesystem is backed by a block device (e.g., ext3/4) then data is written to the block device.\nYou can, however, symlink a specific file to a location in a tmpfs filesystem; this will work as long as: (1) the destination of the symlink exists, and (2) the link is not removed and the file re-created in the original (disk-based) filesystem.\nConcerning ~/.xession-errors, there is some special treatment in /etc/X11/Xsession (lines 63--72 as of x11-common version 1:7.5+5ubuntu1): if ~/.xsession-errors is already a symlink, then a temporary file (in directory $TMPDIR or /tmp) is used instead.  So, if your /tmpor $TMPDIR filesystem is mounted from RAM, you're done.\n", "Q: What BASIC intepreters are available? Was asked by a new Ubuntu user - who also wants to learn about programming - what he could use to run BASIC code. He was working through a BASIC book before trying out Ubuntu, and he'd like to continue without having to switch back to Windows.\nIt looks like there are a few BASIC packages in the standard repositories, as well as projects like Mono which may include some kind of BASIC support. \nWhat would be a good recommendation from the standard repositories - or from a deb package - for someone learning the basics of BASIC and new to Ubuntu?\n\nA: If he is more interested in making games, sdlBasic would be a better option:\n\nsdlBasic\n  is a small, efficient and multiplatform basic interpreter aimed to game creation using the power of SDL library, it was inspired by the old and glorious AMOS.\n\n\nA: why not take look at this small but effective interpreter: my-basic written in C. It's portable. I consider it a good start for either playing a little BASIC or learning how to write a BASIC interpreter in C.\n\nA: I still write some small stuff in QB64. But I'm mostly concerned with data and data manipulation and not graphics. Just finished a tiny program to convert info from one accounting package to another one. Took me a week to write it. Running the program successfully converted 6 years of info before my coffee got cold.\nSmall, compact, but very powerful. Only screen display was showing the file conversions taking place as well as a 'Start' screen and a 'Conversion Successful' completion screen.\n\nA: I have never tried this but I suppose it would be possible to run something like QBASIC through an emulator like DOSBox.

Asked me to select another partition, cancel install or continue without a bootloader.\nEverytime I selected another partition the error would just pop back up immediately (not convinced it even tried writing anything to disk).\nI did do some partitioning when I was in the installer - shrunk an ntfs partition and grew the Linux one to make up for it - the defaults were set to place at beginning of drive and logical (as opposed to primary), so I left it with that. \nThe first time grub just went to the recovery prompt - but most of the commands that were 'supposed' to work, didn't (been reading articles and how-tos). After another reinstall and an attempt to install manually I got through to the grub> prompt, but have failed to get much further.\nI've checked the grub directory and there's no grub.cfg anywhere, but it's definitely 1.9x that's installed. There should be no Legacy Grub installations anymore, that I'm aware of. \nHave gone through various methods to try and load a kernel or configure grub but they've all been unsuccessful.\nFor example: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195275\nEDIT:\nSorry, you're right, I should have been clearer, left a lot of space for assumptions there.

Was failing to get past the grub> prompt because I wasn't loading the initrd image. Did that and I was flying. Just ran update-grub once I got into Ubuntu proper.\n\nA: In my opinion, you try to install by selecting 'continue without a bootloader', when you finish, reboot your computer with a liveCD or LiveUSB again. after being on the desktop, try to reinstall grub with the steps:\nmount ubuntu partition that you installed earlier. you can click on places > your-ubuntu-partition\nopen terminal, run:\n\nsudo chroot /media/your-ubuntu-partition\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\nclose the terminal, and try to reboot it.\n\nA: Your post has been viewed 12 times now with no replies.

But as soon as you enable nvidia-current driver, installed with apt-get, splash screen goes all crazy.\nWith crazy I mean that resolution is very low, font(I assume) is very weird and it all looks like it's been broken.\nThis happened with 10.04 and now again with 10.10.\nHow do I fix splash screen after enabling nvidia drivers?\n\nA: That is easy. First of all:\nsudo apt-get install v86d hwinfo\nsudo hwinfo --framebuffer\n\nThis will show you your supported resolutions. Take note.\nThen:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nSearch for - GRUB_GFXMODE=\nbelow this you need to type:\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=1024x768 <- your-resolution-here\nSave the file and then:\necho FRAMEBUFFER=y | sudo tee /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash\nsudo update-grub2\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\n\nA: Here is a easy script to fix this: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/10/script-to-fix-ubuntu-plymouth-for.html\nI don't know if this will change your alt+F2 problem as well\n\nI think the problem is, that Nvidia GPUs need proprietary drivers that can't be built into the kernel, so they are loaded at a very late boot stage. So if I remember correctly, this script makes your computer load a generic vesa driver to show the splash screen. This actually makes your computer take longer to start (but I don't know if we're talking about seconds or milliseconds).\nI personally wouldn't bother changing core parts of my system for an eyecandy, but as long as it works, it shure is nice.\n\nA: The above fixes didn't work for me, they didnt go far enough. I've tested this with 13.04 but the author on his blog used it for lower ubuntu versions. Original information from this blog: http://jechem.blogspot.be/2011/04/fix-plymouth-splash-screen-in-ubuntu-on.html\nFirst install hwinfo by running the following command:\nsudo apt-get install v86d hwinfo\n\nAfter the installation run the following command and note down the highest resolution:\nsudo hwinfo --framebuffer\n\nFor me this was Mode 0x0361: 1280x800 (+5120), 24 bits, next edit the following file:\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nThis will open the GRUB config file, we now look for GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" and change it with the following, change your resolution with mine and also add the color depth (for me 24 could be 16 or 32).\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset video=uvesafb:mode_option=1280x800-24,mtrr=3,scroll=ywrap\"\n\nThen find the following line (uncomment if needed) and change your resolution again, note that you don't include the color depth:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1280x800\n\nSave and exit, next edit the following file:\ngksu gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules\n\nScroll to the end of the file and add the following line, again add your resolution and the colordepth like you did before:\nuvesafb mode_option=1280x800-24 mtrr=3 scroll=ywrap\n\nThen in the terminal type the following commands and then reboot:\necho FRAMEBUFFER=y | sudo tee /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash\nsudo update-grub\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nFor me this fixed the problem, I tried all the other suggestions and scripts, none of them worked but this does, good luck!\n\nA: The above solution might not work for you. In my case e.g. hwinfo doesn't show the supported resolutions. You can, however, get this information directly from grub.\nPress c to get in the grub console and then enter insmod video_all followed by videoinfo to get the supported resolutions. If your native resolution is supported, use it. Also use it directly as shown (i.e. 1680x1050x32, so include the colordepth). Get back by pressing ESC.\nWhen you have the supported resolution edit /etc/default/grub and the file to include these two lines:\n# The resolution used on graphical terminal\n# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE\n# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1680x1050x32\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\nNow run the following lines to make the splash show earlier and to actually commit the changes to grub.\necho \"FRAMEBUFFER=y\" | sudo tee -a /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash\nsudo update-initramfs -u -k all\nsudo update-grub\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Code snippet manager for Ubuntu?

Kwallet works in GNOME with KDE applications and GNOME-keyring works in KDE with GNOME applications because in a hybrid system both KDE and GNOME supports are working.

You should make sure to back up your files before this in case something goes wrong, but it should expand the partition properly, and you will have an extra 28GB of space.\n\nA: Hmm , i think it could be done by using GParted but , it requires to delete both drives , where it will merge become 1 partition and format it . \n", "Q: Console text appears on shutdown I updated to 10.10 from 10.04 -however not with a clean install but with online update. Since then at shutdown some console texts appear (next to the red spot representing the shutdown steps). Im using the nvidia driver from nvidia.com.\nCan you suggest something?\n\nA: This is not normal and looks like to be related to an issue with the proprietary Nvidia/ATI drivers.\nSee the bug reports on Launchpad #563878 and #653274.\nNormally, during boot and shutdown Ubuntu is supposed to display a high-res Ubuntu logo and not show any text at all.\nHowever, with Lucid Lynx and the recent Maverick Meerkat something changed that this does not work anymore for certain configurations.\nFor me, using the free open source driver this works as expected. However, using the proprietary AMD fglrx driver, both, the boot screen and the shutdown screen are replaced by ugly, low-res text. \nThis does not impact any functionality, but is just a cosmetic thing, which is hopefully attended to and fixed soon.\nUPDATE:\nIt seems like I have found a solution for this problem when using the ATI driver fglrx.\nInstall the packagestartupmanager with apt-get install startupmanager.\nRun it with gksudo startupmanager or by selecting System->Administration->StartUp-Manager. \nOn the Boot Options tab select the desired (high) resolution and color depth (24 bits). Check the box Show Boot Splash, uncheck the box Show text during boot.\nThen hit Close and reboot. Now you should see the boot splash screen instead of the text during boot up and shut down.\nThis solved the problem for me.\nNOTE: This might not solve the problem for people using the Nvidia graphics driver.\n\nA: i've also noticed that when using the proprietary graphics drivers on my system, it seems to interfere with the boot/shutdown splash page. it's not really a functionality problem, but if it bothers you you could file a bug or remove the nvidia driver (my system works quite well without it, as good support is provided by the kernel). \n\nA: Not sure what your referring to but log information displayed on shut down is perfectly normal. Usually when I shut down my laptop, I have a flash of console info like:\nChecking Battery State..\nChecking Unattended-upgrades\nBefore the Plymouth screen.\nNormal behavior, so I wouldn't worry.\n\nA: I am pretty sure thats normal... \nDoes it say anything particularly interesting?

This printer is very popular...\n\nA: For the printer, there is a script that should help you do this with little effort - my source is here.\nYou need to download the script from the Canon Website (you will need to extract this archive). Running the script from a terminal is easy: sudo ./canonLBP_install.sh LBP2900\n\nA: What did you do so far? \nSetting up a LBP-Printer recently, I had to replug the USB after installing, and to restart ccpd. \nConfigure your printer in the browser: http://localhost:631/admin\nThen, in a Shell, do:\nsudo /etc/init.d/ccpd status \nsudo /etc/init.d/ccpd restart\nsudo /etc/init.d/ccpd status \n\n\nA: For 11.10\nI installed a Canon-LBP- printer on my sisters Ubuntu machine. It was a hard riddle, involving several downloads, unplugging and replugging the USB, and finally it printed, but refused to print after reboot.\nThere are two daemons to be started in /etc/init.d which were installed to automatically start, but sometimes, one of them, failed.\nDo a\nps -c ccpd\n\nto check, whether ccpd was started and is running, and if not\nsudo /etc/init.d/ccpd restart\n\nIf it is running,\nsudo /etc/init.d/ccpd status \n\nwhich should show two port numbers. Afaik, I had to restart ccpd\nsudo /etc/init.d/ccpd restart\n\nto bring the printer back. In /var/log/cups/error_log you could find more informations about errors. The first character means:\n\n*\n\n*d debug\n\n*i information\n\n*w warning\n\n*e error\n\nwith increasing severity to the bottom.

I noticed that when in terminal the prompt is generally in the format username@users: or I have even seen username@(none):. I get that the first part is the logged in person's user name, but what is the part after the @ symbol? \n\nA: The Bash command prompt looks like this by default:\n[USERNAME]@[HOSTNAME]:[PATH][SYMBOL]\n\n\n\n*\n\n*[USERNAME] is the username of the currently operating user. normally this is your user, but when you run sudo su or similar commands, you get a \"root shell\", that means the user is \"root\".\n\n*[HOSTNAME] is your hostname. It's the name of your computer. You had to enter that during the system installation.\n\n*[PATH] is your current working directory, the directory you're currently operating on. When you open a new terminal, the default directory is your current user's home directory. A synonym for /home/YOURUSERNAME is ~.\n\n*[SYMBOL] is usually either $ if you're operating as any normal user, or # if you're operating as \"root\" user.\n\n\nSo your Bash prompt looks like this:\nganesh@ganesh:~$\n\nThat means you're logged in as user ganesh on a computer called ganesh as well, currently operating in your own home directory (~). Of course you're not \"root\", therefore the $.\n\nWithout looking th the Bash prompt, you find out your username, groups, hostname and current working directory with the commands below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Username:\nwhoami\n\n\n*Groups:\ngroups\n\n\n*Username and groups, as string and number:\nid\n\n\n*Hostname:\nhostname\n\n\n*Current working directory:\npwd\n\n\nA: The terminal prompt displays the username of your login and the contents of whats in /etc/hostname.\ne.g. My laptop is james@james-laptop\nThis is because my username on my laptop is james and my hostname is james-laptop\n\nA: to expand on what sepp2k said, it is the hostname aka computer-name of the system you're logged into terminal on. most of the time, and for most users, this is going to be the one you're sitting in front of. it is very useful though in the event that you occasionally/constantly sign into remote systems for administration purposes to have the pc name right there in front of you to remind you where you are.\n\nA: It's the hostname, i.e. the name that you gave your computer.\nShowing this as part of the prompt is useful so you can easily tell which host a given shell is running on if you're logged into multiple computers (via ssh or telnet for example).\n\nA: You can, of course, set this prompt to be nearly anything you want- many folks use it to display other information.\nHere's a decent guide that should help you get started. \nDotfiles.org also has a bunch of other customizations you can make to your shell.\n\nA: Just use command groups to list all groups that your current user is part of.

So is there any other way? Or where can I mount the ISO?\n\nA: Try this, taken from here How to use a .iso image as a CD-ROM Repository?\nIf you want to use the ISO image as a software source without burning it, the process will be a bit more complicated. You will need to open a terminal Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal and run these commands:\nsudo mkdir /aptoncd-mountpoint\nsudo mount /media/USB/aptoncd.iso ~/aptoncd-mountpoint -oloop\nsudo apt-cdrom -d=/aptoncd-mountpoint add\n(source: http://www.debianhelp.org/node/10486)\n\nA: You can install .deb packages by double-clicking them, so just install them that way from the mounted .iso image?\n\nA: When it asks for your cd, you can mount the ubuntu iso from the website, in the way that the other 2 people have told you.\nOnce it is mounted, you can add the mounted iso in software sources as a software cd.

I am not sure how good the IDML support is currently, so you will have to test yourself...\nIf you want to try the latest development version of Scribus, there is a PPA for that.  But remember that these are daily builds of the development version, and they are probably not ready to be used for production work yet (and every day a new version will be available, which may fix some issues, but also introduce new ones).\n\nA: FYI: IDML files: Indesign Markup Language files are publicly specified format designed for interchanging data. INDD (indesign documents) are NOT openly specified, but MAY contain useful bits of information following the same conversion described here. \nIf you can get your hands on an \"IDML\" export file, any \"zip\" package utility can unzip it, revealing the images within.

I've also tried to delete and readd Auto Ethernet through the Network Preferences.\nI have a Lenovo ThinkPad L512 with Ubuntu 10.04\n==UPDATE==\nI did the first step Maco said to do and here is what I got:\noscargodson@ubuntu:~$ sudo service network-manager stop\n[sudo] password for oscargodson: \nnetwork-manager stop/waiting\noscargodson@ubuntu:~$ sudo ifconfig eth0 up\nSIOCSIFFLAGS: Cannot allocate memory\noscargodson@ubuntu:~$ sudo dhclient eth0\nInternet Systems Consortium DHCP Client V3.1.3\nCopyright 2004-2009 Internet Systems Consortium.\nAll rights reserved.\nFor info, please visit https://www.isc.org/software/dhcp/\n\nSIOCSIFFLAGS: Cannot allocate memory\nSIOCSIFFLAGS: Cannot allocate memory\nListening on LPF/eth0/60:eb:69:02:50:f0\nSending on   LPF/eth0/60:eb:69:02:50:f0\nSending on   Socket/fallback\nreceive_packet failed on eth0: Network is down\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3\nsend_packet: Network is down\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 4\nsend_packet: Network is down\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 6\nsend_packet: Network is down\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 11\nsend_packet: Network is down\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 17\nsend_packet: Network is down\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 17\nsend_packet: Network is down\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3\nsend_packet: Network is down\nNo DHCPOFFERS received.\nNo working leases in persistent database - sleeping.\n\nI've tried everything Maco suggested and finally figured out my memory isn't low although I keep getting a SIOCIFFLAGS: Cannot allocate memory error. I have over 1GB of RAM free as we speak.\nI found this page:\nhttp://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/weird-ethernet-problem-838220/\nAnd did what the person there said which was:\nlspci| grep -i ethernet\ndmesg | grep -i ethernet\n\nAnd it gave me some output and the last command gave me:\nr8169 Gigabit Ethernet driver 2.3LK-NAPI loaded\n\nI then tried Maco's stuff again and i didn't get the error anymore, however, the Ethernet still doesn't connect although now it doesn't give me the memory allocation error.\n\nA: Sounds like bug.  Lets dig in.\nFirst, stop Network Manager: sudo service network-manager stop\nThen, plug in the cable and bring up the interface sudo ifconfig eth0 up and tell it to ask for a new dhcp lease sudo dhclient eth0  (I'm guessing it's eth0, if not use the right name)\nDid it work? If so, file a bug on Network Manager:  ubuntu-bug -p network-manager\nIf not, try reloading the network driver.  This should simulate a reboot to the ethernet port.  To find out your driver, look in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  You'll see some bits like:\n# PCI device 0x10ec:0x8136 (r8169)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"00:f1:4c:01:94:3e\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth0\"\n\nFinding the one that matches your interface's name, look at what's in the parentheses where mine says r8169.  That's your module's name.\nsudo modprobe -r r8169 && sudo modprobe r8169\n\n(replacing r8169 with your module's name) Try the dhclient step again.  If that worked, I suspect it's a kernel bug.  ubuntu-bug -p linux\n\nA: I'm getting the same problem. Wireless works on boot provided router is switched on beforehand. If its not then I have to go through the process of setting up a network again. Wired connection refuses to work at all with the\nifconfig: SIOCSIFFLAGS: Cannot allocate memory\ncoming up.\nN.B.

If not, how can I add one?\n\nA: You should be able to find it in Docky Settings -> Docklets -> Network Manager. If it isn't mentioned there, then I would assume you need a newer version. You can try this stable PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~docky-core/+archive/stable\nOr use the development PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~docky-core/+archive/ppa\nThe development PPA would be the most up-to-date one, but there's a higher risk of bugs.\n\nA: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/docky/+bug/693251\n\nin docky 2.0.7 on Ubuntu 10.10,\n  there's no network manager docklet.\n\nRico Tzschichholz wrote on 2011-01-03:\n\nThe network-manager docklet isn't\n  installed with the distribution\n  package due dependency limitations.\n\n", "Q: How to map Ctrl/Shift to thumb buttons of Mouse? I have an Microsoft Sidewinder X8 mouse and I wish to use 8 for Shift and the 9 for Control. Can anybody please tell me how?\n\nA: Install xdotool and xbindkeys\nsudo apt-get install xdotools xbindkeys\n\nThen copy the following code into ~/.xbindkeysrc\n\"xdotool keydown shift\"\n        b:9\n\"xdotool keyup shift\"\n        release + shift + b:9\n\"xdotool keydown ctrl\"\n        b:8\n\"xdotool keyup ctrl\"\n        release + control + b:8\n\nwhere b:x is the number of your button which you can find out using xev.\nAs I don't want this bindig permanent everytime I need it I start a terminal and type xbindkeys -n. When I don't need it anymore I simply close the terminal.\n\nA: First install xdotool\nsudo aptitude install xdotool\n\nThen, you can create a script to simulate a Ctrl key press. Open gedit and copy paste the following:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nxdotool keydown ctrl\n\nwhile [MOUSEKEYDOWN == 1]; do  #TODO change the while test.\nsleep 30 \n   #decrease sleep if script doesn't react fast enough on releasing the key, \n   #increase sleep if the computer uses to many CPU when pressing the button.\ndone\n\nxdotool keyup ctrl # Lift the key back up after no button is pressed.\n\nI'm not a great bash programmer. I need to search a way to identify if your button is down and I may have (more than one) syntax errors but I guess a bash programmer gets the idea.\nIf someone fixed the script, save it under ctrl.sh and make it executable \nchmod +x ctrl.sh\n\nThen, as nathwill said, go to system -> preferences -> keyboard. Add a custom command, choose to add the ~/ctrl.sh command and press your mouse button as shortkey.\nThis should do it.\n\nA: http://linux.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/comp.os.linux.x/2003-07/0010.html explains how to accomplish this using xbindkeys and xmacroplay (from the xmacro package). Both of these applications are available from the Ubuntu repositories.\nHere is an example from the site that explains how to map mouse button 6 to the Alt + Left key combination.\n\nPut this in ~/.xbindkeysrc , and pressing mouse button 6 will echo the Alt + Left key combination to the X server, which maps to \"back\" in  Konqueror and Mozilla : \n\"echo -e 'KeyStrPress Alt_L\\nKeyStrPress Left\\nKeyStrRelease Left\\n\n  KeyStrRelease Alt_L' | xmacroplay &\"\n  b:6\n\nThere is Shift_L and Control_L (as well as Shift_R and Control_R if you prefer the right versions of the keys instead of the left versions). Simply substitute these keys into the above command, change b:6 to be the actual mouse button you want to map to the key, and put the command in ~/.xbindkeysrc, and you should be all set.\n\nA: System → Preferences → Keyboard shortcuts lets you map keys/buttons to commands; if that doesn't work xbindkeys is another great application for key mapping.\n\nA: there is a duplicate question: Map Ctrl and Alt to mouse thumb buttons\nso here's a copy of answer from this question, using Easystroke:\ni found a working solution here. it uses Easystroke (sudo apt install easystroke). kudos to @stuartr from ubuntuforums!\nthough there was one issue - re-mapped mouse click sporadically fired an original ('back' in my case) event. to avoid this, mouse button can be remapped to some unused number with xinput set-button-map (sudo apt install xinput). i've put this into my .xsessionrc (taken from this answer by @Maxim):\nmi_mouse_id=$(xinput | grep 'GTech MI wireless mouse.*pointer' | sed 's/.*\\tid=\\([0-9]*\\)\\t.*/\\1/')\nxinput set-button-map $mi_mouse_id 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 20 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\nthis maps mouse button 8 to button 20. hopefully button 20 has no meaning. at least it has absolutely no effect for me.\nnow it's time to re-map button 20 to Ctrl:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferences tab: additional buttons -> add -> radio button 'Instant Gestures' -> click the mouse button of choice in the grey area (for me a 'back, thumb button' became '(Instantly) Button 20')\n\n*Preferences tab: Select 'Autostart Easystroke'\n\n*Actions tab: Add Action\n Name: anything you like (e.g. 'Mouse 20 -> Ctrl')\n Type: 'Ignore'\n Details: click it once to change 'Ignore' to 'Key combination...'. then press Ctrl + a. 'a' doesn't matter and is ignored. 'Key Combination' will be replaced with 'Ctr'\n\n*With the new action selected/highlighted -> click 'Record Stroke' -> press the mouse button you're wanting to use again (this came up with '20 -> 20' in the Stroke column for me)\n\n*Now pressing and holding my mouse button brings up a dinky 'Ctr' on the screen and acts like the button is being held for as long as the mouse button is\n\n", "Q: What are the alternatives to OS X's Spotlight? One of the things I like best when using OS X is the Spotlight tool. You can click a magnifying glass in the corner, and search for apps, files, anything. Windows 7's Start Menu search tool is similar. Does Ubuntu have anything like this?\nGnome Do has some similarities, but it's really more about doing things than searching for things. Something with a panel applet like Spotlight would be ideal.\n\nA: Gnome-do has an official plugin called 'Files and Folders' which indexes any directories you add to its configuration.\nTo enable it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Summon gnome-do (win+space)\n\n*Click the arrow in top right and choose preferences\n\n*Plugins tab under official plugins tick Files and Folders to enable it\n\n*Click configure to choose the folders you want indexed (I have Desktop, Documents, Downloads)\n\n*You can then summon gnome-do and type the name of a file or its extension, e.g. 'mov' to see all movie files (with thumbnails)\n\n\nOf course gnome-do has a wealth of other functionality built in and through plugins.  Well worth a look.\n\nA: I found a search indicator similiar to Mac Spotlight, name is Indicator Synapse. I copied quote from noobslab.com\n\nIt creates virtual index of files and items which are on the system.\nIt is designed to access files and items quickly. It also has ability\nto search in online dictionary/knowledge engine (WolframAlpha) and\nweb.\n\n It only works with Unity Ubuntu 12.04/12.10/13.04/13.10 and Gnome Classic\nTo install Indicator Synapse, open Terminal by press Ctrl + Alt + T and copy the following commands to terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/apps\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-synapse\n\nAfter installation is finished, log out and log in back to see indicator synapse on the panel\n\nA: If you're using Gnome (Ubuntu), then you could give Tracker a try. It's not perfect, but to my experience I don't notice that it's running in the background which I like a lot!\nTracker is available in the Ubuntu Software Centre, just look for it and install it.\nIt comes with a Gnome panel applet so that you can search directly from the top or bottom panel.\nI said it ain't perfect because sometimes it doesn't find back some files I was searching for... But it does a decent job.\n3 years ago, I had try Beagle (also available for Ubuntu), but either it was more power hangry or my computer was too old for that, but I did not have a pleasant experience with it. Nonetheless you could try it. 3 years is long, and my computer at that time was a really old one!\n\nA: Unity Dash\nFrom 11.04 to 17.04 (Unity), Ubuntu had an even better solution built in: The Dash!\n\nWith the dash you can do all kind of cool stuff, such as:\n\n*\n\n*Search through your files\n\n*Find installed and available applications\n\n*Run commands\n\n*There will be many more features in the future, as the dash is extendible through so called \"lenses\". These will allow you, for example, search Ask Ubuntu right from your desktop.\n\nJust hit Super to open it in 11.04!\nFor more information, check out this link.\n\nA: Tracker looks more like Spotlight, but I find it doesn't work as well.  It also takes forever to index and creates a large index file.\nGnome Do is wonderful though.  It is a launcher but it will do much more. Speedy, gorgeous, and tons of plugins.  If you have used Quicksilver on the Mac it will be instantly familiar.\n\nA: So for those of you that like using the command line then locate might be your cup of tea.\n\nA: I use Kupfer.\nIt is an alternative to gnome-do. It was heavily inspired by Quicksilver. \nIt is available from a PPA here on Launchpad\n\nA: Cardapio\nCardapio is exactly what I was looking for. You'll have to install TrackerDownload tracker, start it, then enable the \"File Search\" plugin from Cardapio.\n\nA: Deskbar\nDeskbar is probably the closest application, as far as the user interface goes, to spotlight.\nClick here to install.\n\nIt has a number of backends, allowing you to search for files, launch applications, search the web, and a lot more.\n\nA: Beagle or Tracker for Ubuntu.  For Kubuntu, Strigi.\n\nA: Tracker seems to fit your needs, and 0.8 and beyond is overall awesome. \nYou can install it with sudo apt-get install tracker. Once installed run from Dash with \"Search and indexing\" or from CLI tracker-preferences to adjust preferences., and issue tracker control -s to start indexing, or wait for it to index your files when your system is idle. tracker-needle is the graphical search tool, and there are various CLI tools that you can discover by typing tracker- and hitting the Tab key twice. Also run just tracker to see a list of available commands.\n\nA: For this I use Launchy on both Windows and (K)Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you're willing to go through the trouble of installing it, the Sezen applet uses zeitgeist and does pretty much exactly what you want, except for the fact that it only searches through used files and applications (I'm pretty sure at least).\nhttp://mhr3.blogspot.com/ <- The blog of the guy who's making it\nwww.webupd8.org/2010/08/sezen-applet-is-ready-for-ubuntu-1010.html\n", "Q: Empathy cannot connect to MSN account I've just installed Maverick, and while it seems to work so far, Empathy is unable to connect to my MSN account.

I resolved the issue by apt-get removing the telepathy-butterfly and then removing my MSN account from within Empathy. I then re-added the MSN account and it works.\nIt is my understanding that Emapathy can either use the butterfly or haze module to connect to MSN, by removing butterfly, I forced it to use haze.\n", "Q: How to delete Gnome Panel?

You should save this file in /etc/udev/rules.d (take care it's under /etc and not /lib). As this file starts with a number higher than the one you're trying to alter, it will override it.\nI hope this will help you solve your problem.\n", "Q: How compatible is Wine with Windows as of today? Observation shows that some Windows softwares run perfectly on Wine and some\njust fail miserably.  Rather than trying them out randomly, I wanted to create a\nplace where we can have some ideas about Wine-suitable, and -unsuitable, softwares. \nSo, exactly which areas of Windows operating systems does Wine fully support or\nstill show weaknesses?  By implication, what are the kinds of Windows\napplications that are guaranteed to run without flaws on Wine?\n\nA: In a perfect world, the Wine devs would be able to follow a fixed specification with which to build a fully binary compatible replacement for Windows. But this is not the case. They know the public APIs and know what those APIs are supposed to do. Everything else (ie how they do it) is educated guesswork.\nThe ideal would also involve Windows functioning consistently, which it does not. Parts have been bolted onto very old code. Application developers can work around those bugs when they're building their apps but it also means that Wine has to follow everything, even the quirks and often by trial and error (users submitting bugs for specific applications).\nNothing is guaranteed to run. Even things that work perfectly, even better than native, are not guaranteed to remain that way. Often in the Wine world, in order to fix something, you have to break half a dozen other things... You just hope you (or somebody else) finds those new bugs before the code hits a stable release.\nIf you want long term stable support for a batch of applications, look at the commercial arm of Wine: CrossOver.\n\nA: You should check out the Wine App Database, it lists programs that have been tested on Wine, along with test results.\nhttp://appdb.winehq.org/\nSome programs work great, some don't, some require patches or dirty fixes e.g. Winetricks. Luck of the draw really. Either way the App DB is great as it contains reports on Windows applications that have been tested and detail how successful the program was on a specific distro.\nIt might not have all the Windows programs in the world, but it certainly lists most of the mainstream Windows applications.\n\nA: The compatibility of Wine with windows software varies based on the software and which version of windows it was intended to run on. \nWine App Database has a great index of software and its level of compatibility with varying versions of Wine and Linux distribution. Of course not all applications are reported nor is the status of those applications always up to date.\nThere are also commercial products derived from Wine such as Crossover, and Cedega (although outdated).\nNow that a Direct3d 10 & 11 is going to be natively supported in linux we can expect much more reliability and performance in many more games. \n\n\n*\n\n*www.codeweavers.com/\n\n*www.transgaming.com/\n\n*www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=mesa_gallium3d_d3d11\n\nA: To make sweeping generalizations:\nGames tend to be poorly supported under wine. Things sorta work, almost work, but then usually fail miserably. There are a few rare standouts, but as a rule, I'm pessimistic about running any given game under wine.\nOn the other hand, small \"application-type\" programs tend to function quite well. Tools for doing a single thing usually function, whether it's converting a data format, displaying a file, or doing some other single function. In general, if the whole app is under 10 megs, it's quite likely to work.\nWhere application support tends to break down is when you get into larger projects that have a lot of legacy code.\n\nA: There is also the possibility to use Mono for windows programs that are written in .NET. Search for it and install it. To use, just run mono ProgramName\n", "Q: Sound & Broadcast Icons Missing? I had the sound icon in the main menu bar up top, along with the default Broadcast icon up there. All of a sudden they are missing and I can't find them. I can't find them in the Add to Panel menu either. How do I get them back?\n\nA: It sounds like you're missing the \"Indicator Applet\". It should be available from the Add to Panel menu.\n\nA: It's likely that you've removed the indicator applet from your panel. Right click on the panel, and select Add to Panel, then search for the indicator applet.\n\nNote: I've blurred out the non-default entries I have in my menu so not to confuse.\n\nA: Sound should be under Indicator Applet.\n\nA: You just have to right click on the panel and choose Add to panel... Then scroll down until you find the applet called Indicator Applet. Just add it and the controls/menus should be back.\n\nA: For ubuntu 14.04 launch dconf editor com>canonical>indicator>sound and check the visible option\n", "Q: Recording from line-in stops working after a while Right after boot up, I can record using the line input just fine, but after some time (I haven't been able to tell how much), it stops working.\nAll it records is silence with a bit of static.\nI don't think the program is the culprit since I've tried arecord and Audacity.\nWhat could be the reason? And how could I debug this?\n\nA: Given that you've tried two different recording applications, I'd be concerned about a hardware defect.  Another possibility is that a third application starts up at some point and intentionally mutes the line-in channel.\nIn a terminal, you can use alsamixer to show volume levels for all playback and capture channels.  Be sure to press F5 in order to display all available channels.  Sometimes all the channels won't fit on one screen, so also be sure to keep scrolling to the right in order to go through the entire channel list.\n\nA: When using my mic, I sometimes noticed my mic fell out when going too loud. Open the volume applet and go the the \"input\" tab. See if the volume bars don't touch the end, if they do, reduce the volume.\nMaybe this helps.\n", "Q: \"Can not mount /dev/loop0\" during install from CD Whenever I boot up my PC from the CD, it starts shows the Ubuntu logo with the loading sign and then gives me this error:\nCan not mount /dev/loop0(/cdrom/casper/filesystem/squashfs) om //filesystem squashfs\nI tried downloading and burning the ISO again but I got the same problem.

Redownloading and mounting it again solved it for me.\n\nA: Guys it seems that this issue has more to do with what kind of drive your packing than not enough free space, i have found that an easy way to solve this problem is to download the ubuntu 10.10(it does not have to be this verison, this just happens to be the latest one) dvd version. These \"DVD Versions\" tend to be 4GB in size as appose to the regular 690-700mb ISO File. Please tell me if this has also solved your problem.\n\nA: I had this error when installing 10.10 64 bit from CD-R. I then burned the same iso image to dvd-r and also changed bios plug-and-play option from off to on - error is gone.\n\nA: Try installing from the host system instead of from a CD or DVD - VMware 8 gives you the option of installing the guest operating system from an iso located somewhere on the host operating system. I'm running vmware on Windows 7 and located the ubuntu 10.4 iso in the MyDocuments folder on Windows. Ubuntu installed under VMWare with no problems.\n\nA: Burning to a DVD instead of a CD solved this.

I would like to know what the difference is between these two versions of the same distro.  \nubuntu-10.10-alternate-i386.iso    \nubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso  \n\nI think that the alternative CD is not Live,\nbut is there any more to it?\n\nA: Yes. The alternate CD comes with all the Ubuntu packages (and so can be used as an upgrade package source by simply running apt-cdrom add). The desktop CD has all those packages already installed as part of the squashfs image, which is convenient for doing new installations, but unusable for doing upgrades with.\n\nA: The alternate CD installer is not a live CD. You can't use it to try out Ubuntu, test if Ubuntu works or fix a PC/edit partitions without reinstalling.\nThe alternate CD installer has a command line (curses or similar) installer, whereas the default live CD has a user friendly graphical installer.\nThe alternate CD can be used to upgrade your Ubuntu version. This is useful for offline computers.\n\nHere you can find information on how to install Ubuntu from the Alternate CD. The Alternate CD provides more advanced installation options than the standard Desktop CD, which is the recommended method of installing Ubuntu. For instructions on how to use the Desktop CD, see the Graphical Install page on the Ubuntu community documentation site.\n\n\nA: The download size is another difference, which might be important for some users:\nI give examples here for Lubuntu (based on Ubuntu) in 2018 because Lubuntu is targeted for older or low-specs devices. Where size might matter even more.\nDesktop: 1090 MBytes\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/18.04/release/lubuntu-18.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\nAlternate: 715 MBytes\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/18.04/release/lubuntu-18.04-alternate-i386.iso\n", "Q: How do I upgrade from x86 to x64 without losing settings? Is there an easy way to upgrade the system to x64 from x86 without losing settings and having to repartition etc?\n\nA: No. Well... Not in a way that's worth it.\nThere are some guides that offer a disclaimer-ridden murky pathway from 32bit to 64bit but believe me when I say I've been tinkering with Linux for years I just wouldn't want to take it on. It's a giant hack that intentionally breaks things to fool the 32bit system into taking on 64bit packages. Get one thing wrong and you break the install... And it looks like it would take a long time.\nThe truth is it's just so much easier to back up the things you can't replace (/etc/, /home/, parts of /var)  to another drive, pop in the 64bit live CD/USB and reinstall. Installation to my SSD from USB took 12 minutes last time I did it.\nWhen it's reinstalled, make a new user and copy whatever bits of your profile you want back in. You can either dump it all back in or spend a little bit of time and have a good old-fashioned clean out.\n\nA: Should be simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your /etc and /home folders (I have /home as its own partition, you may need more folders if you have any custom folders... or /var/www if you have apache, maybe backup databases if you had any)\n\n*Run dpkg --get-selections > installed-software to save the list of installed software, backup the file installed-software.\n\n*Install the x64 version, create the same users.\n\n*Restore the /etc and/homefolders and theinstalled-software` file.\n\n*Run dpkg --set-selections < installed-software then run dselect to install the previously installed software.\n\n\nA: I don't believe you can just upgrade to a 64 bit version of Ubuntu, you would have to reformat the partition and install the 64 bit version from the x64 Live CD.\n\nA: You can just perform an x86-64 install over the top of your existing i386 install.  There's no need to reformat or repartition - the Ubuntu installer has supported keeping the contents of /home and (most of) /etc (and other data directories) for a couple of releases now.\nThat will get you most of the way there; you'll keep all your configuration, but you won't have the same software installed.\nTo do that, the guide from this answer should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before installing the x86-64 version, dump a list of your currently installed packages by running dpkg --get-selections > ~/installed-software in a terminal.\n\n*After installing, restore the list of installed packages by running sudo dpkg --set-selections < ~/installed-software followed by sudo apt-get -f install.  There will probably be some packages that can't be installed, as there are some i386 packages without x86-64 counterparts - libc6-686, the 686-optimised libc is the common example.\n\n\nA: James is right.\nAs x86 and x64 are different architectures you can't just upgrade directly from one to another without wiping the root partition and re-installing the system.\nOne thing you can (and MUST) do is having directories where you store settings and files (usually /home/yourusername) set up in a separate partition, as this allows you to format your system without losing important settings, like your e-mail accounts' Evolution/Thunderbird configuration, or any other type of files.\nIf you do the same for /usr/bin (for example), then it also backups all files under this directory in a system format.\n", "Q: How do work the Dell Studio 1537's remote control with infrared receiver port IT8512 CIR I use Ubuntu 10.10.

I hope that someone can help me to solve this problem.\n\nA: The program you need is called lirc supports the remote control, looking into it it seems the driver is certainly supported but your dell model doesn't yet have a configuration file to map the buttons to actions.\nIn order to get this working we need a sys-admin or programmer to take a look at your computer while your pressing the keys to figure it out and write the configuration. The best part is that once it's written everyone else who has the same remote control should have a better time of using it.\nNotes for anyone who wants to do this work: It looks like ITE8709 is the driver for IT8512 (at least in the code).\n\nA: I have a Dell Studio 1737 and also have a non-working remote on Ubuntu, maybe you can get lirc developers to look at it.\nThis is a thread I started a while ago: http://sourceforge.net/projects/lirc/forums/forum/16772/topic/3407688\n", "Q: Trick installer to use btrfs root with compression I want to install Maverick onto a BTRFS root partition. Not for fun or testing, but because I need compression due to a small flash disk (4GB).\nNow the 10.10 installer finally supports btrfs, but there is no way to enable the compress flag in it. Can I trick the installer somehow? For old versions and getting LUKS you could pre-mount partitions. Or is there an easy monkeypatch possible to enable btrfs+compress pre install?\n\nA: Just after the installer mounts your partition, you could try to switch to a shell and do a mount -o remount,compress /target, this might work.\n\nA: I came across this thread as because I was looking to install Linux Mint Debian Edition on a flash drive and installing on compressed btrfs from the get-go. Although these solutions were not directly applicable to reaching my results I used some of this information to reach my target.\nThe problem was that the point of the installer formatting and mounting the partition and starting copying files was right next to each other, as so I was unable to perform the \"remount\" option mentioned by others above.\nThe LMDE version of the installer script was in python (usr/lib/live-installer/installer.py). I'm not sure if it is the same with Ubuntu, but if it is, this will be directly applicable. This allowed me to edit the script and add this line right under the line that origionally mounted the partition for \"/\"\nos.system(\"mount -o remount,compress /dev/sda3 /target -t btrfs\")\n\nof coures the \"/dev/sda3\" will vary depending on your device.\nI understand this is an Ubuntu forum, but like I said it came up with the search and this solution would be directly relevant if the installer is python based. We are all Debian here anyways, right!?\n\nA: More recent distributions use busybox for most commands, including mount. In these releases, /bin/mount is a symlink to /bin/busybox and the symlink must be named \"mount\", and not \"mount.bin\" in order to work correctly. As such, the above answer by Mskje can be changed to the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot as normal to the live session.\n\n*sudo rm /bin/mount\n\n*sudo mkdir /bin/orig\n\n*sudo ln -s /bin/busybox /bin/orig/mount\n\n*sudo nano /bin/mount - this will create a new script.\n\n*Copy this to the script and save (alter the options as you like, here compress):\n#!/bin/sh  \nif echo $@ | grep \"btrfs\" >/dev/null; then  \n    /bin/orig/mount $@ -o compress  \nelse  \n    /bin/orig/mount $@  \nfi\n\n\n*sudo chmod 755 /bin/mount to make it executable.\n\n*Install as normal and your btrfs partition will be mounted with the specified options (here compress).\n\n*After the installation is finished, before exiting the live envirement, alter the fstab of the newly installed system to match the specified options, so it will use the same options on new boots.\n\n\nA: As of 13.04 (Raring Ringtail), you should be able to install on a btrfs volume without compression and then compress every file on the whole volume once you're booted up to the new installation.\nAccording to Oracle's documentation, you can compress existing files on an existing filesystem by defragmenting it with the -clzo option.\nsudo btrfs filesystem defragment -clzo /\n\nPassing it the single slash tells btrfs to defragment all files and directories on your root volume.\nSee: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_use_case1_btrfs.html\nOnce you're done, add the compress=lzo (or compress=zlib if you prefer, but lzo is recommended for speed) to your volume's line in /etc/fstab and reboot so any further files written to the disk will be compressed.\n\nA: An easier way to do this is to alter the mount command of the live environment.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot as usual to the live session.\n\n*Move the mount executable to another location:\nsudo mv /bin/mount /bin/mount.bin\n\n\n*Edit a new file using sudoedit /bin/mount and save the following script into it (alter the options as you like; here we have added compress):\n#!/bin/sh\nif echo \"$@\" | grep -q -- \"-t btrfs\"; then\n    /bin/mount.bin \"$@\" -o compress\nelse\n    /bin/mount.bin \"$@\"\nfi\n\nYou can also match block devices like /dev/sda1 instead of -t btrfs and chain elifs to use different mount options for different devices and filesystems.\n\n*Copy the original permissions over to the new script:\nsudo chmod --reference=/bin/mount.bin /bin/mount\n\n\n*Install as usual and your btrfs partition will be mounted with the specified options (here, compress).\n\n*After the installation is finished, before exiting the live envirement, alter the /etc/fstab of the newly installed system to match the specified options, so it will use the same options on new boots.\n\n\nI used: defaults,noatime,compress-force=lzo,space_cache as mount options.\nThis works with quantal daily (30/6/12).\nI used the btrfs partition as / and a swap partition.\nCredits go to this post (in this thread), which in turn cites this blog post.\n\nA: Selecting manually:\n  /dev/sda1 as btrfs for /\n  some ext? /boot\n  some swap\nIn a terminal:\n  sudo bash\nPress install\nPress enter on the terminal line: (sudo done)\n  mount -t btrfs -o remount,compress /dev/sda1 /target\n\nA: You can get any or all of the cool new Btrfs features by running the mkfs.btrfs command manually. The alternate installer has an option at any point to go back to a previous step of your choice. you can use this to, after the installer creates the btrfs, make your own btrfs and then start the installer at the previous step so your fs gets used. \n\n\n*\n\n*run the installer until after the partition phase.\n\n*let it install the base system.\n\n*alt-F2 go to the terminal and run mkfs.btrfs -  /dev/sdXY\n\n*go back to the installer alt-F1\n\n*hit the \"go back button\" then choose the partition option again. the defaults will be to not reformat so you can just hit continue. it will re-install the base system. say yes to the warning about not re-formatting.\n\n*enjoy.\n\nA: I got it working by replacing the ext4 partition on the stick with a compressed btrfs partition. This can be done using another computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copying everything via \nsudo cp -ar /ext4Partition/* /backupspace/\n\n*Replace partion using gparted with btrfs one\n\n*Mount new partion using sudo mount mount -o compress /dev/yourdevice /btrfsPartition\n\n*Copy back everything \nsudo cp -ar /backupspace/* /btrfsPartition/\n\n*Update /btrfsPartition/etc/fstab to new device uuids and to new partition type. Remove remount Option, as btrfs does not have this.\n\n*reinstall boot loader (e.g. via BootRepair)\n\n\nNote: the directories /btrfsParition, /ext4Partition and /backupspace can be set as you want.\n\nA: You can just add compression later. Open /etc/fstab and edit the line for your root filesystem. Add compress to the mount-options like this:\nUUID=0c8e6d48-e6b3-425a-ab33-24205a9cb586 / btrfs defaults,compress 0 1\n\nNow either remount or reboot and don't forget that /boot can't live on btrfs, yet, since GRUB2 doesn't support it.\n\nA: You could always follow the ancient Chinese proverb:\n\nIf you don't like what the installer partitioner does, partition it yourself and tell the installer to install onto those partitions.\n\n", "Q: Turn off thumbnails for desktop icons How do you turn off the thumbnails for desktop icons?\nEDIT following Oli's answer: Is it possible to do this for the desktop icons without affecting the normal behaviour of the nautilus file manager?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open up a directory in nautilus (via places, etc)\n\n*Click the edit menu, Preferences, Preview tab\n\n*For the first two fields (text and other), select Never.\n\n", "Q: How do I open Visio files? It is possible to open Microsoft Visio files in Ubuntu?  Perhaps something like Dia, or OpenOffice Draw?\nIt is not an emergency, but it would be nice...\n\nA: You could use an online service like http://www.freepdfconvert.com (there are dozens) to turn it into a PDF and with that view it or manhandle it in Inkscape, et al.\nBut as for direct opening, not yet, I'm afraid. It's fairly niche too so I wouldn't expect a solution any time soon.\n\nA: Crossover handles Visio very well, unlike the many issues you may find with Wine.

I am constantly fixing typos.\nI've had this problem since I installed Ubuntu 9.10.  I'm not sure if it is because the biometrics is part of the touchpad, the way the device is built into the system, or the BIOS which does not let me disable it.\n\nA: Definitely not the only way, but one way to do it would be to install gpointing-device-settings and check the \"Disable while any other devices are connected\" checkbox in the \"General\" tab for your touchpad.\n\nA: My preferred way is to never use the touchpad and disable it in the BIOS.  An added bonus is it's a security feature;  it will effectively confuse and disorient anyone attempting to use your laptop.\n\nA: You can disable the click of the Synaptics TouchPad without disabling the mouse movement. In my experience with such device, it was annoying only when touching it was actually sending a \"click\" message, effectively moving the text editing cursor away, scrambling all my typing. You can disable the Touchpad clicking, requiring that you press one of the buttons to effectively send a click. You should find this under the Mouse options in the Preferences menu under Ubuntu. \n", "Q: Where can I find a precompiled gcc 3.4.6 or 2.95 ARM cross-compiler?

Just wondering, are there any projects like WINE, but for Mac software? That is, can we use a program that acts like a compatibility layer to run Mac apps?\n\nA: GNUstep as an equalivelent API to Cocoa, the NeXTstep based Mac API, but it's not complete, needs recompilation, and then your Mac app looks like it went back in time.\n\nA: There was a project attempting to do this for very old Mac Software (68k) called Executor: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor_%28software%29  -- it is, of course, defunct.\nThere is no modern equivalent as far as I can tell, and making such a thing would be almost as big a task as Wine itself.\n\nA: EDIT: Reading the other answers, it appears that there are now ways to do what OP asked. I'm leaving this answer here because it is still a viable alternative on some hardware for applications which won't run under emulation.\nWhile the other answers are correct (no, you cannot), there is a way to install OSX on Virtualisation software such as VirtualBox. This is not what you asked for, so be careful, but it may get you the results you need.\nhttp://www.taranfx.com/install-snow-leopard-virtualbox\n\nA: Recently featured on Slashdot was the Darling project, which aims to provide Darwin / OS X emulation and can already run some Mac OS X applications on Linux.\nIt appears to be developed for academic purposes and is still in its early stages, but it looks promising. It is based on the aforementioned GNUstep.\n\nA: No.\nThere is no way(without emulating/virtualizing Mac OSX itself) to run mac programs, sadly. Unlike Windows, whose libraries have been legally replicated for WINE, there is no such replication for Cocoa, except Gnustep, which is very incomplete.\n\nA: Sadly not.\nThere are various projects that attempt PowerPC emulation, but none that would allow you run your standard Mac OS X application.\n\nA: No.\nYou cannot run Mac applications on an Ubuntu machine. Even if it were possible, it would be very hard to satisfy the requirements of most applications.\nMost Mac applications use features like /Library/Application Support, something Ubuntu doesn't have (to my knowledge). Some apps even modify system files or add new ones (The former could break your system if they happen to be in the same location).\nHowever...\nIf you really want to run Mac apps, your best bet is to either virtualize macOS or boot it natively. The latter would (most likely) be the hardest; it's called hackintoshing and it's a very popular method (but breaks the Apple EULA).\nIf you can find a distro of macOS that would work on your hardware, it's not a bad idea to give it a try if you really want native support. However,  it could be a tough job. I won't go into much detail, but most of what you'd normally want to know can be found with a quick Google search.\n\nA: Hmm , you cant run OSX apps in Ubuntu. Although both OS are based on Unix , but Mac OS X apps are designed to run on its Mac OS X platform and coding , while Ubuntu is based on Debian , there are relatively no common factors.\n\nA: Your best bet now is running Mac OS X in virtualbox and using seamless mode.

I can't find any information that's more recent than 2 years on how to setup packetwriting for my DVD-RAM drive. I like DVD-RAMs for reliable backups and hope to set it up correctly. I tried with some outdated how-tos which resulted in messing up a lot because there was no udev back then! How can I achieve this setup in the latest Ubuntu?\n\nA: DVD-RAM does not require packet writing.\nIf you are referring to DVD-RW or CD-RW packet writing, I know that there are HOWTOs all over the Internet.  However, I have yet to find one that actually works with desktop environments/HAL/dbus/whatever it is that ubermodern systems are using instead of plain old fashioned manual configuration.  :-)\nI'm sure it is possible.  I just can't figure out how to do it reliably without killing half the things that make my system useful.  Sorry, this isn't much of an answer at all, I know: I have been searching for one for the last couple of years.\nThere really were some advantages to the way things were done a few or more years ago.\n\nA: DVD-RAM is very old so there is no new info. Old and underestimated. DVD-RAM on Ubuntu Linux is easy. I use Ubuntu 16.10 with XFCE4 but that does not matter at all. \nWhy DVD-RAM? Because it is more reliable and more stable archiving data. See Wikipedia for details on DVD-RAM. \nHowever, DVD-RAM is rather an external drive than a DVD to write on. Not all drives can write and read. However, most modern Laptop and Computer optical drives can. \nCareful: DVD-RAM is slow by modern means. Don't force the mount and umount to break. \nWe have to format it as UDF file system. This is the appropriate FS for the DVD-RAM (I do not quote the details here, use duckduckgo.com)\nKnow your CD-Writer: \nMount a CD, with „mount“ watch out for the name. Like /dev/sr0. \nTake the DVD-RAM out of the cartridge if necessary, put it in your drive and reboot.\nPrepare: \nsudo apt-get install udftools\nsudo apt-get install dvd+rw-tools\n\nMake a mount point: \nsudo mkdir /mnt/dvdram0\n\nand adapt the user rights etc. \nYou need to adapt the rights again for the mounted DVD-RAM (different than vfat floppy or external drive). \nAdapt the fstab:\nsudo vim /etc/fstab\n\nFor automatic mount enter a new line like \n\n/dev/sr0  /mnt/dvdram0  auto  user,users,rw,auto,exec,utf8 0  0\n\nThe first auto may better be \"udf\". The second auto depends on you: Try noauto if the boot process hangs. \nFormat the DVD-RAM:\nsudo mkudffs --media-type=dvdram   /dev/sr0\n\nThe default options for mkudffs probably match your needs. \nOtherwise: man mkudffs !\nMount the DVD-RAM:\nmount /dev/sr0\n\nshould do it, otherwise use as sudo mount /dev/sr0. With the fstab entry it will be found. \nWhen you ask your CLI now with mount it should answer something like:\n\n/dev/sr0 on /mnt/dvdram0 type udf\n  (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,utf8,user=myname)\n\nNow again adapt the access rights for the mounted(!) drive: \nsudo chown myname /mnt/dvdram0\nsudo chmod u+rwx /mnt/dvdram0 \n\nTest your access rights:\nmkdir /mnt/dvdram0/mydirectory\n\nwithout sudo it should work.

It has a Gigabyte motherboard which has a Realtek 8111d onboard network card.\nIn Windows, networking works fine. If I switch to Ubuntu, I have no network connectivity whatsoever, and in order to boot Windows, I have to leave my computer off for a minute or two in order for networking to work after having Ubuntu running.\nSince Ubuntu by default installs the r8169 driver for my network card, I've tried installing the r8168 driver, since that's supposedly the correct driver for my card. It hasn't helped.\nI installed 10.10 today (a fresh install), hoping that'd fix the problem. It didn't, so I checked lsmod, which showed the r8169 driver installed again. So I try installing the r8168 driver (according to these instructions) and it installs without any problems. I shut off my computer and unplug it, then go do some homework for 10 or 15 minutes. I come back, hoping the combination of the new driver and being powered off for a while have fixed it. Alas, no luck.\nI would post the outputs of various commands, but because of the above issues, it's rather difficult. However, if they're absolutely necessary, I can do so.\nSo, any help that could be provided would be great.\n\nA: Try this (from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=538448)\nIf your ethernet cable is connected at boot time and you are experiencing the no link problem, try this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown, power down.  \n\n*Unplug your host (this cuts power to the card if wake-on-lan power is maintained).\n\n*Wait 15 seconds.\n\n*Plug in.\n\n*Boot ubuntu.\n\n\nA: There are two guides:\nhttp://www.twm-kd.com/linux/realtek-rtl81688111e-and-ubuntu-linux/\nhttp://www.jamesonwilliams.com/hardy-r8168\nI actually prefer the first one. Works fine with latest Realtek driver r8168-8.026.00.tar.bz2, but only with linux kernel 3.0. 3.1 and 3.2 will complain about \"invalid module\".\n", "Q: Is there any way to get AutoHotKey or IronAHK working? I am very interested in getting AutoHotKey, the windows program for automation of keystrokes, working under Ubuntu. So far I have installed Wine, but am unable to use any of my previous windows scripts. Are there any recommendations?\n\nA: If you have AutoHotKey scripts to automate Windows applications running in Wine, then AutoHotKey is exactly the program to use.  Fortunately, AutoHotKey is very easy to install in Wine, as the Wine project uses it for our automated QA tools.\nThe easiest way on Ubuntu is to just enable the Wine PPA and install the Wine package there.  This will pull in the winetricks package.  Then you can open a terminal and type \"winetricks autohotkey\" and it'll download+install it for you automatically.\n\nA: Autokey is a linux equivalent of AutoHotKey for Windows.\n(Update 01May16) The above page no longer exists. There is now a port of it to Python 3 on Github.\nSome of its features\n\n\n*\n\n*KDE and GTK versions available, making AutoKey integrate well into any desktop environment.\n\n*Write Python scripts to automate virtually any task that can be accomplished via the keyboard\n\n*Built-in code editor (using QScintilla in KDE or GtkSourceView2 in GTK)\n\n*Create phrases (blocks of text) to be pasted into any program on demand (uses the X selection)\n\n*Create collections of phrases/scripts in folders, and assign a hotkey or abbreviation to the folder to display a popup menu\n\n*Regular expressions can be used to filter windows by their title, to exclude hotkeys/abbreviations from triggering in certain applications\n\n*Scripts, phrases and folders can be attached to the tray icon menu, allowing you to select them without assigning a hotkey or abbreviation\n\n*AutoKey can track your usage patterns and present the most frequently used items at the top of the popup menu\n\n\nFor me, the biggest difference is that Autokey uses Python as its scripting language, instead of a specific proprietary language as AutoHotKey.\nThey also have an Ubuntu PPA, so you can install it easily and keep up with updates.\nYou can read a really good article(on How to Geek), on installing and using Autokey to set you up quickly.\n\nA: This is more a warning than a solution.  I found instructions for building IronAHK on Ubuntu 10.  Check all the comments to get it working on Ubuntu 11.  But after building and trying to run a few scripts it seems to me that IronAHK is rather far from a full implementation.  Core functionality such as, say, hotkeys doesn't seem to be working yet...  Would be happy to be shown wrong here though.\n\nA: IronAHK and AutoHotkey (Wine) works on Ubuntu, although they will only capture hotkeys and forms under .NET (IronAHK) or Wine Applications (AutohotKey).\nI've teste AutoKey and it is great, but unfortunately it doesn't handle mouse events very well.\nIronAHK is not being developed anymore, so you will have to build from source using monodevelop. I found some bugs related to goto (around 3 issues), which I changed to if else statements, then I could compile normally.\n\nA: there's quite a few text macro applications for linux, as well as some applications for recording and re-running various keyboard and mouse events as needed. \nwhile i've never used AutoHotKey specifically, i use Texter at work and believe it's similar to what you're looking for. (if not could you please clarify particularly what it is you want to get done and maybe that'd help somebody answer). \nthere are a lot of applications/IDE's that support text macros in linux, or if you're looking to combine repeated actions across multiple applications there's xmacro... http://xmacro.sourceforge.net/\n", "Q: How to properly configure the Audio? If i connect my headphones the speaker still work is that a bug? or that suppose to happen just like that that never happen to me before.\n\nA: Yes, this is a bug.\nYou can try to install the linux-backports-modules-alsa package and then see if the problem still exists after a reboot.\nIf that doesn't fix it, please run the following command, and follow the instructions:\nubuntu-bug alsa-base\n\nThis will collect info about your audio hardware & software configuration, ask some questions, and submit this to the bugtracker on Launchpad (if you don't have a Launchpad account yet, you will be asked to create one).  Once you are on Launchpad, make sure you add a clear description of the problem.  E.g. if it worked in earlier Ubuntu-versions, pleas tell which one(s).\n", "Q: Wine menu directory location? Using the menu editor I accidentally deleted the WINE menu. Now I am stuck with the application installed and no way to easily use parts of it. I tried reinstalling it, many times, and still the menu does not show up. I think that a directory exists where the menu is at, but it is just marked off as deleted. Can anyone point me to this directory or tell me another way to get the WINE menu back?\n\nA: You will need to recreate those entries in alacarte (System -> Preferences -> Main Menu) and recreate your entries.\nTypically the Wine menu will still be there - only hidden. Once you have alacarte open check to make sure you don't have a Wine entry already there:\n\nIf you do not click on Applications on the left column then select New Menu from the right. Enter the following details\n\nOnce you've named the menu click the Icon on the right of the New Menu Dialog to choose the Icon. I've included the path for the Wine image in the following screenshot:\n\nAfter closing the new Menu dialog select Wine from the list on the left column. You'll need to recreate the following items:\n\nYou can recreate the Applications directory by following the steps above for adding the Wine Menu item. For Browse C: Drive You will need to add a \"New Item\" with the following fields entered:\n\nRepeat this for both Configure Wine and Uninstall Wine Software\n\n\nFinally to add back applications from Wine to the Applications folder navigate to the Applications folder on the left column and select \"New Item\" using the following example as a template:\n\nReplacing the WINEPREFIX path with the path to your Wine Prefix (Typically /home/<USER>/.wine) and the path to the Applications executable.\n", "Q: Exporting encrypted folders for NFS Have used NFS for quite a while on 9.10 and 10.04 to access folders on PCs on the LAN. I recently chose the 'Encrypt home partition' option when installing Ubuntu 10.04 on a new PC. \nNow when I attempt to Export a folder that is on the encrypted home partition, Exports throws up a message that the folder cannot be exported.\nI have searched the web high and low and found a couple of other users with the same problem, but no resolution.\nI can successfully export folders that are not on encrypted partitions.\nIs NFS not compatible with folders on Ubuntu encrypted home partitions?\n\nA: The kernel-level NFS server (nfs-kernel-server) does not work well with custom filesystems like FUSE, if I remember correctly. Instead, you should give unfs3 a try.\nI haven't used unfs3 and can't promise anything, but I believe anything is better than nfs-kernel-server for serving from non-traditional filesystems.\n", "Q: What's the difference between Google Chrome and/or Chromium? What are the advantages/disadvantages to each? I used Google Chrome in Windows, and am now using Chromium in Ubuntu.  Is there any difference to the two programs?  What are the advantages and disadvantages to each program?  Which one seems better?\n\nA: There may be additional differences, but the biggest is that Chrome is not FOSS, Chromium is. Chromium also lacks the built-in flash plug-in, though I understand that it will pickup the normal plugin(ffmpeg) without issues.\n\nA: Chromium is the bleeding edge development of the project. It is the browser, and whatever its current state may be. We usually get a few Chromium builds per day.\nGoogle Chrome is simply a re-branding of Chromium, but is a little more ready for public consumption.\n\nA: There is another major difference chromium is with usage tracking, like link posting\nfrom wikipedia:\n\nChromium snapshots appear essentially similar to the latest builds of Google Chrome aside from the omission of certain Google additions, most noticeable among them: Google's branding, auto-update mechanism, click-through licensing terms, usage-tracking, a built-in PDF viewer and bundling of the Adobe Flash Player.\n\n\nA: Google Chrome is the end product designed for everyday use. Chromium is an opensource project to develop the code that runs Google Chrome.\nOne thing to note, Google Chrome releases obtained via Google officially should be stable whereas code from the Chromium project is cutting edge and likely to be buggy.\nIf you want a browsing experience that isn't riddled with bugs, go for Google Chrome. If you enjoy browser crashes and Flash memory and CPU usage being through the roof, you clearly need the bleeding edge untested code direct from the chromium project.\nAt Last we have to understand that, whether it  is Chrome/Chromium/Firefox/ Google probably doesn't care which web browser you use. Google wants this internet eco system to grow and that is where their money is. \n\nA: Chrome blocks extensions outside the Chrome Web Store; Chromium does not.\nChrome includes tracking features such as RLZ; Chromium does not.\nChrome's EULA used to include the following:\n\nyou give Google a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free and\n  non-exclusive licence to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish,\n  publicly perform, publicly display and distribute any Content that you\n  submit, post or display on or through the Services.\n\nThis has been corrected, whatever that means. Whether this point matters though is debatable; after all, if you have nothing to hide...\nFinally, Chromium does not include closed source code like Chrome allowing the community to review it. This, along with the fact that Chromium is less complex since it does not include some goodies like flash and pdf reader, makes it, at least theoretically, more secure.\nFor the interested reader, there is also an official blog post about the relationship between Google Chrome, Chromium, and Google.\n\nA: The official Chromium Wiki provides a detailed list about the differences between Google Chrome and Chromium. It does not reflect differences of vanilla source versus those that are specific to Chromium packages provided by Ubuntu.\n\nA: I don't know why people are posting the uninformed answers. Chrome beta, canary, and dev are the 'bleeding edge' versions of chrome. At the end of the process, i.e. after a chrome stable build is released, you get a chromium build.\nIf chromium builds were the latest and greatest, google chrome would be the slowest browser around. Competitors would be leeching everything chrome constitutes of.\nFurthermore, with chromium, individuals will be missing new plugins, such as Google Cloud Print, Chrome PDF reader, etc.\nPersonally, I stick to Chrome, I tried chromium but uninstalled within the day.\n\nA: What I care more is the EULA and privacy issues related to the two browsers. Read this article which touches (a bit) of the issues:\nhttp://www.techdrivein.com/2010/05/why-cant-we-all-use-chromium-instead-of.html\nSo I have changed from G-Chrome to Firefox and back to Chromium.\n\nA: First of all, Chromium is owned by the community. Chrome, is owned by Google, so Google can do anything with it.\nChromium is Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS). That means if you have enough programming skills, you can see and modify its source code, and, eventually, make it a Closed source (=CS) software (like the Torch Browser on Windows).\nGoogle has already taken and modified the OS code with 3rd party CS, with its own code, and released the CS software named Chrome. Some of the code added include PDF reader, Flash player (which will update, but the Linux one will not update any more) and tracking (so Google and the NSA will know everything).\nOn Ubuntu, Chrome release = Chromium release, because the Ubuntu team took care about that (as soon as a Chrome update is released, an Ubuntu's Chromium update is released, based by the same source code, but, of course, without Google's code).\nHope that this explained everything.\nThe choice is yours:\nChromium's safety\nor\nChrome's full-of-features ability.\n(or Firefox or any other browser... There are many browsers in this world... Or even take the source-code of Chromium and make your own browser)\n\nA: There are some key differences between Google Chrome and Chromium. First off, Google Chrome is a commercial closed source product made by Google which is based on the open source Chromium project.\nChrome is not available in the default Ubuntu repositories as it's not open source, however Google makes Chrome available through their own 3rd party repository. Chrome is updated by Google directly, as they run the entire repository and update Chrome on their schedule. Since it doesn't need to be redistributable and open source, Chrome includes things that we can't ship in Ubuntu out of the box, like Flash and H264 support (See the Ubuntu promise). However you can install this support with a few packages (see below).\nChromium, being open source, is available in the Ubuntu repositories. This is maintained by Ubuntu developers and goes through our Stable Release Update process. Chromium has a release process exception, which allows the team to upload a Chromium build as soon as a new upstream release is made.\nThere really aren't any proper \"releases\" made of Chromium, so Ubuntu developers base their build on what stable version of Chromium the stable Chrome build is based off of. Fabien Tassin has a blog post about this process that goes into much more detail.\nThe following packages in Ubuntu install the codecs and features in Chromium that you can find in Chrome:\n\n*\n\n*chromium-codecs-ffmpeg \n\n\n*chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra \n\n\n*flashplugin-installer \nReally it depends on what you want. If you trust Google to not break your computer and like the convenience of Chrome then you can use that; if you want an open source browser that is the basis of Chrome that is peer reviewed by Ubuntu developers and doesn't require 3rd party sources then you want Chromium.\nThis Wikipedia page outlines some of the security/usage tracking differences between the two browsers.\n\nA: In addition to other answers, one practical difference that I've noticed is that Chromium doesn't come with, and quite possibly doesn't support, some DRM libraries such as used by Netflix, and so you'll most likely have trouble trying to run Netflix on Chromium, as well as other Web applications that may require them.\n\nA: Google Chrome is based on Chromium, the Open Source Web Browser. I've been using both of them and they are 99.99% similar. I finally choose to use Chromium because it's open source. You can still use all the extensions for Chrome, and also sync your bookmarks (and other stuff) with a Gmail account.\nIf you look at Wikipedia it says that the differences are that Chrome has Adobe Flash Player pre-installed (not open source software) and Chromium not. But you can still install it later very easily. That Chrome has auto-update mechanism, but using Ubuntu you have auto-update (and you can also add the Chromium repository). Also that Chrome has Google's brand and Chromium not (I don't care) and they say something about the colors of the logo (not very intelligent comments). Finally they say that Chrome has click-through licensing terms and usage-tracking. This last thing I'm almost sure is optional.\nUse Chromium!\n\nA: Google Chrome is the stable version of Chromium browser . Google Chrome is based on Chromium . Hence , Chromium is a developer build where tests and new features are being tested at Chromium before it is shifted to Google Chrome as stable version . The biggest difference between the both builds is that Chromium does not have Adobe Flash Plugin embedded while Google Chrome is built in . Moreover , Chromium is updated daily to ensure previous bug had been fixed .\n\nA: A new reason to use Chromium, rather than Chrome - Chromium does not prevent you from using third party extensions. Google Chrome now totally blocks all extensions that are not directly from their Chrome Ap store.\n\nA: Yes, Google Chrome works fine on Ubuntu(has higher memory usage than firefox, but less cpu than firefox). Difference between Chrome and Chromium is that Chromium is open-source and it is a bit more buggy.\n\nA: To answer you question more precisely...\nChromium is the Open source browser made free; free as in free not free as in beer...\nGoogle Chrome is the Google Branded version of the Chromium browser.\nTrademarks are applied and icons and images are added and thru some kind of legal loop holes Google can \"claim\" chrome as its own product. btw the trademarks expire soon.\nIn plain speak, Chromium is the Car and chrome is the color paint on the car... its not functional to the car. I hope that makes sense!\nso chromium is the car painted blue, and chrome is the car painted blue but with a giant sticker slapped on it in the form of a logo and trademark.\nif the chromium ceases to exist chrome would cease to exist and google could do zero about it. \nill be brief,\nchromium allows google to download but not upload so in a sense they are not even in control of the product, if someone on the chromium end decided to \"hack\" the chromium browser, chrome would automatically update the chrome browser and everyone using it would be affected by the chromium \"hack\"...\nfull disclosure, its made like this for a reason! if google had control of the chromium browser they would have sold it like netscape ;) back in the day... \nThis is for You! \n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu on an iPad? I'd love to install Ubuntu as a standard standalone on my ipad, is there any way to do so?\n\nA: Considering the incredible amount of difficulty it would take to actually get Ubuntu running on an iPad, I'd recommend taking a different approach.\nKeep in mind all information I'm about to tell you will COMPLETELY VOID YOUR WARRANTY (and, as a about a week ago, is illegal in the US due to the Librarian of Congress being an idiot/group of idiots).\nRunning Ubuntu is theoretically possible to run on the iPad. OpeniBoot is known to run Linux kernels, especially Android.\nPersonally, I'd recommend booting into Android and taking a path that many with an Android tablet do - using a chroot. This involves booting into Android and sharing that kernel with a desktop operating system. This allows you to keep the touch friendly parts of an OS but also run Ubuntu on the side. For more information on running Android on iPad, take a look at The iDroid Project.\nRunning two OS's is far from optimal though. This is where the real tinkerers come in.  I'm sure it's possible to run Ubuntu , but I haven't seen any real evidence of it being done. There's a first time for everything!\nI don't own an iPad, but I do know a bit about chroot on Android. I've got the Asus TF201 and have Ubuntu 12.10 alongside Android. Although sometimes running Ubuntu directly on it would benice, sometimes it's just not realistic.\nLet us know if you can get Ubuntu running on it. Otherwise, go with the iDroid method.\n\nEDIT: \nIt turns out the OpeniBoot doesn't work on the iPad.\nSo at this point, it seems there is no way to get Ubuntu running natively on the iPad.\nNot even the iPad 1 has had it's bootloader fully cracked yet by the iDroid team.\nThere are many other ways to get Ubuntu look  and feel like it's running on your iPad, but running natively on the iPad will probably never happen.\nMy solutions:\nRun Ubuntu on a headless server (or just any computer) and use a VNC app to access it.\nSame as above, but instead of using VNC, you can use this app to natively run an X Server on your iPad. \nBoth of these require an internet connection to some Ubuntu computer.\nI'm sorry to say it's just not possible to run Ubuntu directly on your iPad offline. The advantage here, though, is that you don't need to jailbreak your iPad for either of these methods, and it's completely legal and your warranty will be safe.\nPlus, you can have your main Ubuntu Desktop (if you use a Desktop) run two X Servers - one for the iPad, and one for your normal desktop use. That way, all of your files would be in the same location and it would appear as if you were on your desktop (you actually would be), but you would be able to use both simultaneously.\nIf you really want a tablet that runs Ubuntu, buy a Nexus 7 or 10 - there's plenty of documentation to get Ubuntu running on those.\n\nA: While installing Ubuntu on an iPad would be awesome, you need to really tinker with the iPad and open up the kernel.\nThis could possibly void any warranty attached to the device. \nSince it is not possible to install Ubuntu on an IPad, the advice is to leave IOS 4 on your iPad and Ubuntu on your PC/Laptop.\n\nA: For the time being, there is up to now, no way to install Ubuntu (or any Linux system for that matter) on the iPad as easily as rooting an Android. Since a year and half ago in an article about Linux running on Ipad (August 2011) there has been only small changes and steps to provide a final way of installing Ubuntu to an iPad (Or any other Mac hardware for that matter).\nThe team behind this, the iDroid team has a webpage where you can see their status and how far they have gotten: http://www.idroidproject.org/wiki/Status\nThey also provide a way called Bootlace to install the bootable part of the system (iBoot) called OpeniBoot. It currently supports only 3 devices from the different that exist.\nOf course, at the end, you are limited to only accomplishing the boot part in the devices it supports. The good news is that, as far as the history of Linux is concerned, there is no ¨iCan´t¨, there is only I CAN! so in the future this could possibly be done in an out of the box manner.\nThanks to a link provided by mateo_salta, there is no legal way right now (There is a debate about it from the FSF) to jailbreak an iPad. The information can be read HERE.\nFor what it is worth, this is just another attempt from the DMCA to stop something they should not be stopping. If you buy an iPad, it is YOUR iPad. Maybe just hop into a plane out of the US, buy the iPad, do whatever you like with it and then come back ^^.\nUPDATE: So here is some information regarding a neighbor I have that, apart from looking like Steve Jobs without the glasses, also knows about the idroidproject and has every Mac device since the palm. He showed me the iPad 1 and 2 and explained A LOT of stuff about how Mac works in regards to, let's say, blocking, ways of trying to root, jailbreak or any other word you would like to use to change how the system behaves or even change the actual system (Like installing Ubuntu on an iPad). So here are the key points that I could write about:\n\n*\n\n*The iPad and any other new hardware needs to first be compatible or supported at least first with the Linux kernel. If not, then it will be very tough to get it working on Ubuntu. This creates a problem for the correct detection of the CPU, motherboard, video card, sound card, wireless card, battery detection and usage and any other hardware found on the device.\n\n\n*There is a strong force behind not allowing any way to be able to overwrite the actual system with another or any apps that can do this. Everything is very tight, sandboxed and checked to make sure it conforms to the way the iOs works. There are alternatives like Cydia but it needs the device to be jailbroken first.\n\n\n*There is a strong legal pressure from Mac to force any attempts to do something like installing Ubuntu on iPad be denied or very tough to do as one can see from the links above.\n\n\n*Since Mac focuses on a specific type of hardware and works only on a small group of devices (Compared to Linux on how open it is with hardware types), it makes it even tougher to guarantee that the new system, be it Ubuntu or any other Linux, will actually work correctly with all the hardware every time.\n\n\n*Since bootlace only works with Phone 2G, iPhone 3G or iPod Touch 1G and with a specific version of the iOs, it makes it the more difficult to get the iPad working in the present time (With all the points above pushing in on the problem)\n\n\n*With the slow development of the openiBoot project and seen how it can actually only detect the CPU used in the iPad as of this writing we can only see that it will be a long way until a proper boot, load and install procedure can be made to get any Linux distro into an iPad. Here is the image from the status page:\n\nSo it is sad to see such a strong wish against using Linux on this type of hardware and I should say such a good hardware indeed would actually enjoy Linux on it.\nAs an addition to this, today I found out about Evasi0n which is a tool used to Jailbreak several Apple devices. The download can be found here\nSo sorry for the negative answer and the pessimist approach I bring to it. Most of this information is thanks to a heavy Mac user that also delves himself in the Ubuntu world and knows much about this. He almost convinced me to leave Ubuntu and jump to Mac (Mac evangelist hehe) but he also made good points (From the Mac side of course) regarding the reasons behind such a close sourced way of focusing on this devices. Not my kind of answer since I tend to look for an answer but I got curious and started asking many Mac users and well.. you can see how my answer changed to a more clear one... if I can call it clear.\n", "Q: How do I install Parallels Guest Tools on Maverick?

Please go to /var/log/parallels-tools-install.log for more information.\n\nHas anyone successfully got this to install? Is there something I can fix on my end, or do I have to wait for Parallels to support it?\n\nA: It sounds like the Parallels Guest Tools' kernel modules do not support Linux 2.6.35 yet. Can you download a newer version of the tools? If not, you'll have some source code editing to do. (I don't have Parallels, so this is the full extent of the advice I can give. :-P)\n\nA: Install the following update to resolve this problem:\nhttp://download.parallels.com/desktop/v6/en_us/parallels/ga/ParallelsDesktop-parallels-en_US-6.0.11826.611899.dmg\nWhy this took three days of back-and-forth with their email support to pry this url from them is beyond me.\n", "Q: How do I synchronize a Palm PDA with Evolution 2.30? Ubuntu 10.04 allowed me to sync my Palm PDA (such as memos, calendar, address book) with Evolution using Gnome Pilot.  However, in 10.10, the options for Evolution syncing in Gnome Pilot no longer exist.\nHaving Googled my issue, it seems Evolution 2.30 was built without the \"--with-pilot-conduits\" flag.\n(http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/xsoft/evolution.html)\nIs there a way I can either install a version of Evolution built with support for Gnome Pilot (preferably from a .deb file or repository), or compile it myself?\n\nA: I couldn't tell you if that is indeed the problem, as I don't own a palm device, but I can confirm by looking at evolution's build log that that flag was not passed. http://paste.ubuntu.com/512047/\nIf you'd like to try building evolution with that flag, here are some steps.\napt-get source evolution # Download the evolution source package\nsudo apt-get build-dep evolution # Install all of evolution's build dependencies\nsudo apt-get install devscripts # Tools for working with Debian packages\nsudo apt-get install libgnome-pilot2-dev # Extra build dependency need for the \"--with-pilot-conduits\" flag. \n\nNext, you want to edit the debian/rules file. Find the section that looks like:\nDEB_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS += \\\n    --with-openldap \\\n    --enable-nls \\\n    --disable-scrollkeeper \\\n    --disable-pilot-conduits \\\n    --with-krb5=/usr \\\n    --sysconfdir=/etc \\\n    --libexecdir=/usr/lib \\\n    --enable-plugins=experimental \\\n    --enable-python \\\n    --disable-pst-import \\\n    --disable-image-inline \\\n    --disable-contacts-map\n\nAnd replace the --disable-pilot-conduits \\ flag with --enable-pilot-conduits \\\nYou'll probably want to bump the version number in debian/changelog as well. You can do that by hand, or run something like dch -v 2.30.3-1ubuntu6+pilot-build -m \"Enable pilot-conduits\"\nNext, the line debian/tmp/usr/share/gnome-pilot must be added to the debian/evolution-common.install file and debian/tmp/usr/lib/evolution/2.30/conduits/*.so must be added to debian/evolution.install\nThen you can build the package by running debuild from inside the evolution-2.30.3 directory. Finally, install the resulting debs.\n\nA: Following the excellent steps by andrewsomething and from Wu Wei Wiki, I've made a script to automatically download the source code, edit the build flags, and compile it.  enable-evolution-conduits.sh \nPrecompiled .debs\n32bit: debs are on the Wu Wei Wiki blog at the top of the page.\n64bit: evolution-debs.tar.gz\nOnce you install all of the deb files, log out then log back in to finish.\nBuilding from source\nSave enable-evolution-conduits.sh and set it as executable.  (Right-click the file, go to Properties.  Click the Permissions tab, and check the box \"Allow executing file as program\")\nDouble-click the file, and choose \"Run in Terminal\", and supply your password when asked.  It may take up to an hour to compile Evolution.  To finish installing the compiled debs, you might have to enter your password again.  When complete, log out then log back in.\n", "Q: How to remove group in Empathy? I have created a new group in Empathy IM by right-clicking on a contact, then Edit and Add Group. \nHow do I remove a group?\nUPDATE:\nOK, obviously Murat Gunes answer is correct, but that's not exactly what I meant. When I right click on the group name and select Remove it removes the group from the main window. \nHowever, the group is not purged from the system. When I right-click on a contact again and select Edit, I can still see the group in the list and I can even put a contact into that group, which then makes it appear again in the main window.\n\nA: Right-click the group title and hit \"Remove\".\n\nA: You may need to remove them for Windows Live (possibly from the web client, or the Windows client itself) in order to have them permanently gone... \n\nA: Do what Murat says and then restart Empathy (not just closing the window, but really quit it, then start Empathy again).\n", "Q: Open source graphics card options? What graphics cards work best with open source drivers?\n\n\n*\n\n*Drivers must be open source\n\n*Needs to support 2 or more monitors\n\n*Compiz is desirable, but not required\n\n*I don't care about games\n\n\nIs there hardware that exists right now that fits this bill?\nEdit: Clarification: I'm really looking for hardware other than nvidia/ATI.\n\nA: An Intel GPU would fit your constraints, but Intel doesn't produce any discrete hardware, so it's only an option if you're buying a new motherboard or CPU.\nWhy are you discounting nVidia and ATi hardware?  They're basically the only discrete GPU hardware vendors, and you're unlikely to find any hardware cheaper than a low-end ATi GPU (for example, this Radeon 3450 from newegg).  It's difficult to find second hand hardware as cheap as that once you include shipping.\nAll modern ATi and nVidia hardware will drive two displays.  The only thing you need to look out for is the type of connectors - if you've got two DVI monitors, you'll need to ensure any card you buy has two digital outputs.\nI'd recommend an ATi graphics card - the open source drivers are generally good, and AMD releases the documentation so new cards can be supported reasonably quickly.  I bought a Radeon 4350 card for about $30 and it works flawlessly with Ubuntu 10.10, including compiz.\nAdditionally, if you want to go for more than two monitors, ATi “Eyefinity” cards can support up to 6 monitors - although all but one have to either connect using DisplayPort or use DVI and an active DisplayPort→DVI connector.\n\nA: Many Nvidia cards should be fine, thanks to Nouveau. http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/FeatureMatrix has some details.\n\nA: From my experience the Intel GPUs are pretty good supported. The drivers work well and even compiz worked out of the box. I use the multimonitor setup (Expand desktop, not separate login sessions per monitor) from time to time and it works seamless even when the monitors are plugged in while I am logged in.\n", "Q: How do I make the webcam work with flash 10.2.161.23? I have a webcam and it works with cheese and gmail video. The problem is that it doesn't work on a lot of broadcasting websites (like tinychat). The flash permission popup doesn't appear when I try to use the webcam. \nubuntu 10.10 (x64) with flash 10.2.161.23 (x64).\nAre there extra steps to be done?\n\nA: It works here for example: http://www.xarg.org/project/jquery-webcam-plugin/\nIt's not working on tinychat so maybe it's a but on tiny's side.\n\nA: Have you tried adjusting the settings on this page?\nhttp://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html\n", "Q: Where's kprinter in Lucid? I've been using kprinter for several years as a way to give programs that don't have fancy print dialogs (like gvim) a fancy print dialog. From a command-line sense it looks a lot like lp or lpr, but it pops up a GUI for choosing printers and setting printing option (eg: duplex, pages per side, page ranges, etc.).\nI can't find kprinter on my system since upgrading to Lucid. What package is it in?\nIf it's been permanently removed (as seems to have happened with a few other things I used to use) is there a good alternative? I found gtklp, which is passable, but doesn't seem quite as nice as kprinter.\n\nA: Kprinter is not found in Lucid because \"Kprinter obviously has been removed from KDE4\" \nSource: kprinter tool missing\n\nA: You can install kprinter again by typing sudo apt-get install kdeprint in the Terminal and hitting Enter.\nFor more, please refer to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2384\n", "Q: How to tether with a Blackberry 9000 via bluetooth? How do I tether my Ubuntu 10.10 via Bluetooth with Blackberry 9000? I set everything up and tried to connect, but it keeps asking me for the password. I don't know what password it wants.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: If it asks for a Pin (maybe they named it password) while you are setting up the bluetooth connection: Just enter a 4 digit number (like 0000). Bluetooth requires you to authenticate a new connection by entering the same Pin on both devices to ensure that you really have access to both devices.\nIf it asks after you have made the bluetooth connection: Sorry, no clue ;)\n", "Q: How do I set the representation of dates? Living in the United States, it is most common to have dates expressed like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Oct 12, 2010\n\n*October, 12, 2010\n\n*10/12/2010\n\n*Tue Oct 12\n\n*Tuesday, October 12, 2010\n\n\nI prefer the big endian form for my dates like below:\n\n\n*\n\n*2010 October 12\n\n*2010-10-12\n\n*2010 Oct 12, Tuesday\n\n\nor the little endian form\n\n\n*\n\n*12 October 2010\n\n*Tuesday 12 October 2010\n\n*12.10.2010\n\n\n4 digit years, 2 digit month\nWithout changing the locales information for my currency, etc, how would I go about setting this up so that system wide it can be expressed in either of the types of forms.\n\nA: This page has a good walkthrough for what you want:\nhttp://ccollins.wordpress.com/2009/01/06/how-to-change-date-formats-on-ubuntu/\n\nA: You can set LC_TIME separately to a locale that supports those (but make sure that that locale is supported on your system!).\nYou can add support for a locale with System --> Administration --> Language Support in the GUI, or  with locale-gen (read the manual, it's not trivial) on the command line.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Won't install on my Desktop Hardware Specs  \n\n\n*\n\n*Motherboard: MSI 770-g45\n\n*ATI HD5770 (H577FM1GD) connected to monitor through single DVI port\n\n*AMD Phenom x4 Black Edition\n\n\nWhen I try to boot up from a live cd/live usb all I get is a black screen, I can boot into the current Windows 7 mode fine. What can I do to remedy this situation.\n\nA: Try directly installation, not \"live\" installation,\nAnd whatever check your RAM.\n\nA: Did you try both the USB and CD method? How did you burn the .iso to the CD and USB? For the CD, burn at x4 speed to avoid data errors. If problems still occur, why not try the alternate .iso?\n\nA: I had the same problem (black screen when boot from CD, like monitor turned off), had to do the following to fix it (it was related to open source ATI driver that shipped with 11.10):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu 11.04\n\n*Install ATI official driver from Additional Drivers\n\n*Perform upgrade from within to 11.10\n\n*Again, install ATI official driver from within 11.10 (not sure it was required, but it let me do it again so I did)\n\n\nA: Also, suggest you go to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM and confirm with MD5 the ISO file you downloaded to burn with was not corrupted in transit. \n", "Q: Kernel Panic when upgrading to 10.10 Yesterday I downloaded the 10.10 update using the update manager. The download went normally, but I encountered numerous errors while the new packages were installing, which caused my upgrade to fail. I restarted my computer, and after the BIOS screen I began to consistently get the following error:\nKernel Panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)\nPid: 1, comm: swapper Not tainted 2.6.35-22-generic #33-Ubuntu\n\nand then there is a 10 entry call trace.\nI've been searching for a solution since this happened last night. Some forums recommended running a disk test, which I did from the live cd with no errors. I also tested the memory, and that showed a lot of errors (62). So maybe my RAM is toast, but I don't know why it would fail on the upgrade.\nI also ran the boot info script found on sourceforge, and the RESULTS.TXT file is here: http://pastebin.com/MKc2tS9e\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: What happened, as is evident from your grub.cfg, is that while your upgrade didn't succeed, it upgraded your kernel to the 10.10 kernel (2.6.35) anyway.\nWhat you need to do is hold down Shift at system startup. Then, at the GRUB menu, pick the 2.6.32 kernel (which corresponds to 10.04).\nI'm not promising that this will solve everything (or even anything), but booting into the new kernel when the upgrade has aborted is probably not going to fly. ;-)\n", "Q: How can I get Google Earth working? I would like to install Google Earth under Ubuntu 10.10. Under v10.04 there were some problems. Has anyone been able to get it working satisfactorily? Was Wine used?\n\nA: Here are some methods to install google earth :\nMethod 1: Medibuntu\nMedibuntu offers a Google Earth package for Ubuntu 10.04. You can download and install it here. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select your system type (i386/32 bit, amd64/64 bit) to start the download. Double-click on the downloaded package to open the Package Installer, and click Install Package.\nStart Google Earth from Applications->Internet->Google Earth.\nMethod 2: googleearth-package\nIf the Medibuntu package is out of date or unavailable, you can create your own package with an easy script. The Ubuntu repositories offer a script which can create an easy to install Google Earth package for you.\nOpen Ubuntu Software Center and install googleearth-package.\nOpen Applications->Accessories->Terminal\nType the command:\nmake-googleearth-package --force\nWait for the script to build your package. This could take a minute or two depending on the speed of your computer and your Internet connection. At the end you should see:\nSuccess!\nYou can now install the package with e.g. sudo dpkg -i .deb\nYou should now have a Google Earth package waiting in your home folder. Open Places->Home Folder, find the package named googleearth_VERSION_ARCH.deb, double-click to open the Package Installer, and click Install Package.\nStart Google Earth from Applications->Internet->Google Earth.\nIf you’re having trouble, check out the Ubuntu Community Documentation on Google Earth. I’ve also written previously about installing Google Earth using the installer from Google.\nAdapted from Google Earth Installation\n\nA: Use this link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GoogleEarth\n\nA: 5.2 (the one pulled in by the package and the default download on Google's site) is broken on a lot of hardware.  If that's the problem you're having, 5.1 works fine. Choose 5.1 from \"advanced setup\" on this page:  http://www.google.com/earth/download/ge/agree.html \n\nA: You could install it directly from Google's own repository.  Instructions on setting up that repository for 10.04 are here: http://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/ubuntu1004.html\n\nA: OK, So I am answering my own question here.\nGoogle earth didn't play very nice on v10.04, but there at least was a mediubuntu package for that version. There isn't a v10.10 package available.\nSo to get GoogleEarth working, you will need to add something to the software sources.\ndeb http://packages.medibuntu.org/ lucid free non-free\n\nAfter doing that click here to automatically install this package.\nI tried many things, and this was the option that actually worked.

I want to learn how to compile vim from the sources, because there are some additions that I want to add, and learn how to deal with this situations, but until now I didn't have success doing it, I can compile vim, but without its GUI\nI think it's a dependencies problem, but I can't figure out which packages I have to install, what are the dependencies to compile vim with its gui?\nI found an article about how to compile gvim, but I don't have the packages for install in my ubuntu 10.10 repositories, I hope to find some help with this\nGreetings\n\nA: Generally you can use the \"build-dep\" command of \"apt-get\" to fetch dependencies to a package. Use it like this:\n\nsudo apt-get build-dep [package name]\n\nOr more specifically for gvim:\n\nsudo apt-get build-dep vim-gnome\n\nAfter that you should be able to compile gvim/vim either without further intervention or with only small set of dependencies to resolve required by a newer version of gvim/vim that you are compiling.\nAs Marius noted one such dependency resolution is installing libssl-dev manually:\n\nsudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n\nEnjoy!\n\nA: For building Vim on Ubuntu or Debian, follow the steps listed here: https://gist.github.com/211238\n", "Q: How do I install GNOME Shell? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install and use the latest version of GNOME Shell? \n\n\nHow to a install and use gnome shell in ubuntu 10.10?\n\nA: Install the gnome-shell\n package. You can try it out by pressing Alt+F2 and entering gnome-shell --replace. \nEDIT: You can install gnome3-session to allow you to choose GNOME SHELL at login. This is a more robust solution than the following\nIf you want to permanently switch to the GNOME shell interface, open up a terminal (Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal) and copy and paste this into the teminal:\nln -s ~/gnome-shell/install/share/applications/gnome-shell.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/gnome-shell.desktop && gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/session/required_components/windowmanager \"gnome-shell\" -t string\n\nSee the GNOME Shell website for more details.\n\nA: Keep in mind that Gnome Shell from the repositories is a snapshot of an early development release. It will stay the same until the next Ubuntu release. If you want to try the latest Gnome Shell and get updates as they happen, you'll need to build it from source. This is made fairly easy if you're willing to play with the terminal :)\nThere are directions at http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell#Building\nYou can use wget instead of curl -O, and you should run sudo apt-get build-dep gnome-shell first.\nIn this case, best to just run it in place (as they explain in that page) instead of installing it.\n\nA: You can install the gnome3-session package.  That will give you an option on the GDM login screen to select between the regular “Ubuntu Desktop Edition” session, and the “GNOME 3” session which will use gnome-shell.\nGDM will select whatever session you last used by default, so this is an easy way to switch between the regular Ubuntu environment and GNOME 3/gnome-shell.\n", "Q: How to mount FreeNAS network share persistently I have a FreeNAS server in the house on which we keep our media. I would like to be able to automount this share in a persistent location when the machine is turned on so that the music players can index the music and we can conveniently browse through the folders etc.\nHow will I accomplish this?\n\nA: If you're looking to have a persistent mount that is stale-proof (outside of the networking being down, or the remote machine being off) I would recommend using AutoFS\nIn short Autofs (also know as Automount) will only mount a directory when it is needed or accessed and after a few moments of inactivity will unmount itself. By doing so you can setup a persistent network location like you NAS and have it always accessible on your machine in the same mount point without having to worry about the mount going stale when networking drops or if you suspend your computer.\n\nA: Set up your server to provide the share as NFS (assuming it hasn't already). Then follow the guide here: http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.1/Deployment_Guide/s2-nfs-fstab.html\nAlso, you might have to install nfs-common package for it to work.\n\nA: You need to add an entry in the /etc/fstab for this. See this question for a sample entry. As the answerer explains, smbfs package may be required. This post gives more detailed instructions on the /etc/fstab entry to be added.\nYou would have to use gksudo gedit /etc/fstab to edit the file as root.\n\nA: Further to Marco Ceppi's answer (I'd have posted this as a comment if I had the necessary reputation): \nWhen you want to use autofs for the job, have a look at autosshfs, which allows mounting an sshfs (fuse) filesystem with a user's ssh-agent. That solves the usual authentication issue with autofs: since it runs as root it is tricky to set up to authenticate as a user without having to type a passphrase every time or use an unprotected SSH key.\n\nA: Judging by the tags you need to mount Samba. For that matter look here:\nSamba Client Configuration Guide on Ubuntu Wiki\nA good resource to look for answers about Ubuntu is http://wiki.ubuntu.com since many questions are answered there in greater detail. :)\n", "Q: How can I install Windows after I've installed Ubuntu? I have Ubuntu on my laptop. Now I want install Windows 7 in a dual-boot. How can I do this?\nI can't lose my Ubuntu files, and I'm afraid that I might break GRUB.\n\nEditor's note: Current readers should keep in mind that this is an older question, and the exact steps may have changed over time.  Also, UEFI has primarily replaced BIOS in that time.  As a result, many answers here may be out of date.  Make sure you choose an answer appropriate to UEFI or BIOS depending on your system, and consider favoring more recent answers which may have more up-to-date information.\n\nA: When you boot have you checked the boot order on your BIOS? If you're booting straight to the hard drive it will always miss the USB. You need to move the USB device boot option higher in the priority list.\nAlso check that your computer allows you to boot from USB in the USB port you are using.\n\nA: First, you have to boot with a live CD/USB stick and shrink your partition in order to create a second one. Windows 7 requires and creates a second partition which is called \"system reserved\". I don't know why, but it does. (So you will end up with three partitions or four if you have a swap partition.)\nWhen your partition is ready, just boot with your Windows 7 DVD/USB stick and install Windows 7 on the new partition.\nWhen Windows 7 has been installed, GRUB will break and you will only be able to boot Windows (automatically). Just boot with a live Ubuntu CD/USB stick and fix it (how it is mentioned in other comments).\nNow another issue that some users may face:\nI own an HP Mini 210 netbook which came with Windows 7. I erased everything and installed Ubuntu. Later on I decided to also reinstall Windows 7 and have a dual boot (needed Windows for a specific application from my university which wouldn't run through wine). At that time I had three partitions:\n- Ubuntu\n- Swap\n- Backup/download storage\n\nNow when I tried to install Windows 7 I faced a problem because Windows 7 needs to create a second primary partition (system reserved). I already had three partitions and therefore was unable to create two more. The workaround here is to create an extended partition in which you will include both swap and backup storage. Now I have:\n- Ubuntu (primary)\n- Extended\n  - Swap\n  - Backup/download storage\n- Windows 7 (primary)\n- Windows 7 system reserved (primary)\n\n\nA: To install Windows you need an empty partition that will be dedicated to Windows. If you do, then go ahead and install on this using the normal installation procedure. After installation, reboot into Windows and reboot a few times more to experience Windows ;-) (sorry, couldn't resist)\nLike you said, this will break GRUB and your computer can only boot Windows after this. Do not despair, as there is a help section dedicated to restoring GRUB and being able to dual boot. Look here. After performing this, your computer will be able to boot Ubuntu as well as Windows.\nBefore you start, very very carefully note down the location (hard drive number, make & partition number within that) of the current Ubuntu install (which you don't obviously want to overwrite) and the empty partition in which you want to install windows. Also, during Windows installation, if it offers to format any partition other than the one you are installing Windows into, please do not accept. \n\nA: In case your computer came with a pre-installed copy of Windows 8 and you removed it because to many people told you to hate it and you found that after you installed Ubuntu, that it isn't what you want, note this:\nYour computer boots with UEFI and has a GPT partition table.\nFor installing Windows 7, either create and boot the Windows 7 installation media in UEFI-mode or set boot-mode and partition table to legacy.\n\nA: The most save way is to install Windows 7 first and to reinstall Ubuntu after that. This will ensure that grub works.\nYou can also edit your partitions with a live cd, and then install Windows 7. When you have done this you boot into Ubuntu with a live cd and restore grub. This procedure however, is a bit more delicate than just installing them in the right order.\n\nA: I suggest you virtualize Windows 7 with something like VirtualBox (http://www.virtualbox.org)\nThis way you can run Windows and Linux at the same time, without the chance of destroying you Bootloader Grub.\nI don't know why you want to run Windows 7, but if you don't need the full hardware capacity (Running the Latest 3D Games for example) of your computer for windows then virtualization can be a good solution. \n\nA: One good advice: When you make the separate partition for Windows 7, using gparted for example, format it to the NTFS right away. Do not use Windows installer to format the partition, because several times I had a situation, when the Windows installer corrupted the partition table after that and I had to restore the lost partition.\nSo, as the people recommended here: using gparted, create separate partition, format it to the ntfs, install windows there, then restore grub using livecd or liveflash. You can use the SystemResqueCD for liveflash.\n\nA: Basically the same answer as @evgeny, but using chroot instead of a symbolic link.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a Ubuntu LiveCD\n\n*Open GParted and make sure you have an unused partition with at least 20GB free space. This will be your Windows 7 partition.\n\n*Install Windows 7 onto this partition.\n\n*Boot into a Ubuntu LiveCD\n\n*Make a note of the partition Ubuntu is installed on and any separate /boot partitions if applicable.\n\n*Mount your Ubuntu installation \nsudo mkdir /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/<partition> /mnt\n\n*Give this partition internet access\nsudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf\n\n\n*Only if you have a seperate /boot partition, otherwise skip this step\nsudo mkdir /mnt/boot\nsudo mount /dev/<boot_partition> /mnt/boot\n\n*Set up then enter chroot\nsudo mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount -o bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n\n*Make sure grub-pc is the latest version\napt-get update && apt-get install grub-pc\n\n\n*Install GRUB\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\n\n*Exit chroot\nexit\n\n\n*Reboot and check if it works\n\n\nA: UEFI only!\nThis answer covers UEFI-only, and is meant to be a bit of a more modern answer as UEFI has succeeded the ancient BIOS. Also, there are some edits here to fit the fact it's answering a \"how I do this\" rather than a \"can I do this\" type of question.\n\nTo install Windows alongside Ubuntu, you just do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Insert Windows 10 USB\n\n*Create a partition/volume on the drive to install Windows 10 on alongside Ubuntu (it'll create more than one partition, that's normal; also make sure you have space for Windows 10 on your drive, you might need to shrink Ubuntu)\n\n*Install the Windows 10.\n\nThat's it!\nNote: when making sure things are ready for your dual boot, check if Ubuntu is installed in the GPT partition table! While 99% of the time you will be using GPT if you're planning to do this, it is possible to install Ubuntu's UEFI on MBR but Windows 10 does not support that strange use-case. In that situation, convert to GPT if possible. If not, backup and reinstall, and I'd recommend that as it'll be easier.\n\nA: Boot that USB\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on or restart the computer.\n\n*While the display is blank, press the F10 key to enter the BIOS settings menu.\n\nNOTE: The BIOS settings menu is accessible by pressing the F2 or the F6 key on some computers.\n\n*Select the Advanced tab using the right and left arrow keys.\n\n*Press Enter. \n\n*Use the up and down arrow keys to select Boot Order.\n\n*Follow the on-screen instructions to change the boot order so that USB is at the top\n\n*Press Esc.\n\n*Select the Exit tab using the right and left arrow keys. \n\n*Press Enter. \n\n*Press Enter. \n\n\n\n\nReboot...\n\nA: Here's the general outline:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make space for Windows\n\n*Install Windows\n\n*Mount the /boot directory or partition\n\n*Install the bootloader (GRUB)\n\n\nStep Zero – Backup your important data before doing anything\nStep One – Make space for Windows\nOpen up GParted, and make sure that you have at least 20 GB available for Windows 7, either as a partition you can remove, or as unpartitioned space. If it's a partition, remove it from GRUB to make sure it doesn't break your Ubuntu install — GParted will complain if anything bad is about to happen.\nMake note of current /boot device. If that doesn't show up there, make note of the / device. The device name is something like sda5.\nStep Two – Install Windows\nInstall Windows 7 into the space you just made\nStep Three – Mount /boot\n\nNote: Instead of mounting the boot directory or partition from the installation in the live media environment you can specify the path with the --boot-directory parameter for grub-install, more information on the manpage.\n\nLoad up from your Ubuntu live CD, and then run these commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you DO NOT have a separate /boot partition:\nsudo mount /dev/DEVICENAME_FROM_STEP_ONE /mnt\nsudo rm -rf /boot    # Careful here, make sure YOU ARE USING THE LIVE CD. I tried it, it works.\nsudo ln -s /mnt/boot /boot\n\n\n*If you have a SEPARATE /boot partition:\nsudo mount /dev/DEVICENAME_FROM_STEP_ONE /boot\n\nStep Four – Install the bootloader\n\nNote: These instructions were initially written for Windows 7 and BIOS booting computers. If you have UEFI and Windows 8 and above you probably need to replace grub-pc with grub-efi-amd64 in sudo apt-get install grub-pc.\n\nThen continue with those commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-pc\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda     # NOTE THAT THERE IS NO DIGIT\nsudo umount /boot\n\nAnd restart. It should work fine and boot both systems.\n\nA: Installing Windows after Ubuntu is not the recommended process for a dual boot Windows and Ubuntu system, but it is possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, you have to make sure that the 50GB free space is available, resizing your Ubuntu by using gParted if necessary.\n\n*Also use gParted or Disk Utility to format the the free space as NTFS, this prevents Windows 7 from creating an additional boot partition in addition to the \"C\" drive.\n\n*Next, boot to the Windows DVD installer and install Windows on the NTFS partition. Upon reboot, Windows will automatically boot and you won't see the grub menu allowing you to choose Ubuntu, because the Windows bootloader has replaced grub.\n\n*Now, what you need to do is run Ubuntu from LiveCD or LiveUSB and install boot-repair.\n\n*To install boot-repair, open up a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and type the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n\n*After installation, boot-repair will automatically launch, if is doesn't, launch it via Dash. \n\n*Make sure to select recommended repair to repair grub. Reboot and that's it.\n\n*You should now have a Grub menu on boot, allowing you to choose from Ubuntu, memtest, and Windows 7\n\n\nA: boot-repair did a really good job launched from a live-usb, by just applying the recommended option.\n\nA: Its a easy process to install dual OS. 1st create a NTFS partition from Ubuntu using Disk Utility. Then restart your system and continue with your windows installing. After finishing installing you can see that your GRUB is not working..... NOT A PROBLEM. I have two method to fix this GRUB problem.\nMethod 1\n[Method 2] It may be bit difficult. Don't worry i have also a easy one. For that you have to login into windows. Download EasyBCD and run it. Go to Edit Boot Menu and set your desired boot option as default. Then save it and reboot your system. [Tested under windows]. \nPlease let me know if you stack in something.\n\nA: Installing windows after ubuntu is a pain but after you do this you'll need to put in your ubuntu live cd and install boot-repair and run that. Becouse installing win7 after ubuntu will break grub. But, boot-repair will remedy that! \n", "Q: Nvidia graphics card failed after upgrade to 10.10 After upgrading to 10.10, my system is unable to start in normal mode due to problems with graphics drivers.

I would like to see a full how-to guide on how to install Ubuntu.\n\nA: Use this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\nIf you want to keep Windows, then for step 6, read carefully:\n\nIf you want to install Ubuntu on a\n  single partition Dual Booting, Select\n  Guided – resize. In the New partition\n  size area, drag the area between the\n  two partitions to create your desired\n  partition sizes. Click Forward.\n\nIt's a good idea to either have the guide open on another computer or print it out, so that you have it available during the install process.\n\nA: *\n\n*First, you will need to download the current version of Ubuntu at  Download Ubuntu Desktop. Select your architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit), and click the big orange button. If your computer has at least 2GB of RAM, select the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. If you are unsure of the flavor you need, select 32-bit as it will run even if you have a 64-bit processor. You may also download any distro release, such as Kubuntu or Xubuntu or Other Flavours.\n\n*Next, you will be downloading a large .iso file, about 800MB-1.6GB. It can take up to a few hours, depending on your connection speed. Let the file download. Then, you will be burning it onto a DVD or LiveUSB. The Ubuntu 14.04 .iso file is too large to fit on a CD, so you will need to either burn it to a DVD or else make an Ubuntu live USB using a flash drive that has at least 2GB. (links are for Windows, if you are switching from another operating system check the \"Easy ways to switch to Ubuntu\" section on the download page.)\n\n*If you are using Windows 7 or higher, you may double-click this file (assuming you don't have another program associated with it). Otherwise, install ImgBurn (sadly, not open source). You may also may be able to right-click and select 'Burn to Disk'.:\n\nMore instructions can be found here or here if you need them\n\n*You now should have burned your disk. If you open the disk using your file manager, there should be a bunch of files like wubi.exe, autorun.inf, pics, and pool, among others. If you have just one file on the disk with the same name as your ISO, make sure you are using a disk burning utility. Do not just drag and drop the ISO file. It will not work.\n\n*Now, put the disc back in your optical drive, and reboot your computer. On a PC, you should have a key like Delete, F2, F10 or another key that will get you to your boot sequence menu. You can enter your BIOS menu by pressing one of these keys as soon as the motherboard splash screen appears when the computer is booting. Otherwise consult the manual for your computer or BIOS and look for something similar to boot from external media or choose a startup disk (⌥ or Alt on Macs) to find the key that is needed. Follow the screen prompts to boot from the optical drive your new disc is in.\n\n*Assuming you are not booting UEFI, press Shift once you get a purple screen with a picture at the bottom. Select your language with the arrow keys and Enter. Now, you should be confronted with a menu. You may try Ubuntu without installing, or you may install it. If you want to try it, choose \"Try Ubuntu without installing\", try it, double-click the Install Ubuntu icon on the desktop, and continue with this guide. Note that this test version is slower because it is running from a CD/DVD/USB, not your hard disk. Some versions of Ubuntu will give a graphical menu for this step.\n\n\n*Now, you will be confronted with a checklist. You may safely disregard the second option 'Install this third-party software', though Adobe Flash Player and some proprietary video codecs may not work, unless you enter the commands at the end of this guide.\n\n\n*Now it is time to partition your hard disk. If you want to avoid losing data or dual boot, this step is crucial. If you want to just clear out whatever is already on your hard disk, and use all of the space for Ubuntu, select that option, and skip to step 10. If you want to dual boot and trust the Ubuntu installer (not recommended), select the option to install side-by-side, and skip to step 10. If you want to manually set up dual boot, select the choice for advanced partitioning and proceed to the next step.\n\n\n*Find your current Windows partition. It should be the first or second under sda, and its type should be NTFS. Click it once, and click Edit to invoke the partition settings dialog. Reduce the size by at least 40,000 MB, or more if you have extra free space on your old installation. If you have a separate Documents partition, you may resize that instead. Then click in the free space you have created and click Add, setting the type to Swap area, and giving about 1.5-2 times your RAM (Note that the input box takes sizes in MB, not GB.) You will now have swap space. Click in the remaining free space and add an ext4 partition with the default size (maximum possible recommended), and the mount point as /. You may also want to do a /home partition, which is where all your user files in Ubuntu will go. If you make a mistake anytime during this, click Revert. \nFor more detailed instructions (and with screenshots) on this step, read How to use manual partitioning during installation?\n\n*We are now ready to install! Click 'Install Now', and allow the partitioning tool in the Ubuntu installer to write changes. Now you should be prompted to select a time zone. The Ubuntu installer wisely tries to guess your time zone, assuming you have a functioning internet connection.\n\n\n*You will now be confronted with a choice of languages again. Select your language, and on the next step, select your keymap (keyboard layout). If you are unsure, click on the button to detect your keyboard layout.\n\n\n*On the next screen, you may set your username, display name, and password. Pick a strong password. A strong password can contain lowercase alphabetic, uppercase alphabetic, numeric and other printable characters. Although your username must be all lowercase, your display name is what is displayed in the login menu and may contain capital letters and spaces in it. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you dual boot with Windows, you will be faced with an option to migrate documents. Pick the users and folders you want to migrate.\n\n\n*Now you may sit back with no trepidation, until faced with the prompt stating the installation is complete.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you installed on a UEFI system you may want to run the following commands before booting into your new installation:\nsudo su;\nefi=\"/target/boot/efi/EFI\"; \\\nif [[ -e \"${efi}/boot\" ]]; then \\\n  echo \"Backup:\"; \\\n  mv -v \"${efi}/boot/\" \"${efi}/boot-bak-$(lsb_release -cs)\"; \\\nfi; \\\necho \"Copy:\"; \\\ncp -va \"${efi}/ubuntu\" \"${efi}/boot\"; \\\narch=\"$(ls -1 {efi}/ubuntu/shim*.efi)\"; \\\narch=\"${arch#*shim}\"; \\\narch=\"${arch%.efi}\"; \\\ncp -v \"${efi}/boot/shim${arch}.efi\" \"${efi}/boot/boot${arch}.efi\";\n\nThis will copy Ubuntu's boot files to the default bootloader location and backup any previously existing files. By doing this you save yourself from headaches caused by non-standards compliant behavior of some UEFI firmwares found on VirtualBox as well as some older HP, Toshiba, Sony and other devices. Related bug report.\n\n*If you changed the drives' boot order in the BIOS during step #5 in order for the system to boot from the Live DVD / USB (or the system was configured already to boot from the DVD / USB drive) and click \"Restart now\", the system will reboot into the Live DVD / USB and not into your fresh installation. Remember to either roll back the changes you made in the BIOS or remove the medium (according to whether you want your current boot order configuration to stick or not) before booting again.\n\n\n*After you finish all these steps, connect to the internet, open the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run these commands:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras     \n\nThis will update the packages on your system and install codecs for proprietary files with restricted copyright (MP3, AVI, MPEG, Microsoft fonts) and Adobe Flash Player.\nEnjoy Ubuntu!\n\nA: Download Ubuntu's ISO file at https://ubuntu.com/download \nor for a supported flavour with a different Desktop Environment, download from https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours \nNext, check for download errors per https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-how-to-verify-ubuntu . \nMake a LiveUSB following these instructions on \n\n\n*\n\n*another Linux PC  \n\n*a Windows PC, or \n\n*a MacOS X machine. \n\n\nOnce you make a LiveUSB, install it following these steps https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop \n", "Q: Prevent xchat from trying to join channels until I have been authenticated I use XChat for IRC. Some of the automatic channels I want to join require that I be identified with services. I have set xchat to autologin with nickserv when i start up, but sometimes there is a delay, it will try to join certain channels (and fail), before I am authenticated. Is there some way to tell xchat to delay trying to join some channels until after I am authenticated?\n\nA: As mentioned on the freenode faq, there are two additional methods you can try. If you have a cloak on freenode, there is a script that will prevent you from joining channels until your cloak has been applied (which requires that you are identified). This method will only work if you have a cloak. The second and better method is to use SASL.\n\nSASL is a method of identifying during\n  your connection, before anything else\n  happens\n\nYou can view instructions and access scripts to enable SASL here.\nA script for XChat is available here in Python or Perl. To quote the README:\n\nCopy cap_sasl_xchat.py or\n  cap_sasl_xchat.pl to your .xchat/\n  directory, so that it auto-loads. Once\n  loaded, use the /SASL command to add\n  or remove SASL settings per network --\n  its help text describes the syntax.\n\n\nA: put :<username> <password> in your ~/xchat2 file:\nP=:nick password\n\nafter that the channels for autojoin.\nset delay on 20\n\nI changed the following line in ~/.xchat2/xchat.conf\nirc_join_delay = 10\n\nA: If we're talking about freenode (this may apply to others) you can authenticate at the same time as you connect. Just set the server password as your nick's password and you'll auto-login. \nYou can use nick-grouping and other various cleverness to auto-ghost your old user and take it back.\nhttp://freenode.net/faq.shtml#identify\nOr you can auth connecting with any nick by using a slightly more obtuse connect string:\n/connect irc.freenode.net 6667 :<username> <password>\n\nIn xchat, this means you put :<username> <password> into the server password box.\n\nA: \nThere is /set irc_join_delay $SECONDS.\n  Default is 2.\n\nSet it to 20 or any good number (determine it experimentally), and that should do the trick.\nStolen from http://forum.xchat.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3966\n\nA: For X-Chat you'll want /server not /connect.\nUsing /connect will give this slightly confusing response; \"* Permission Denied - You're not an IRC operator\". This is because if X-Chat gets an unknown command it passes it through to the server.\n\nA: Along with all these other great answers I'd recommend you put your nickserv password in the \"Server Password\" Field, instead of \"Nickserv Password\" this will cause you to identify to the server right away, instead of having some ident lag that has ya join, then quit to auth then rejoin. You don't notice that process but others can so it does happen...do that and you should notice a difference...\n", "Q: USB mouse moves but doesn't accept left clicks I've just installed a fresh copy of 10.10 and for some reason the mouse wouldn't work correctly. \nI can move it, and I even have context menu on the desktop and the network and sound applets (I am using the default theme if that even matters), however I cannot open anything else. \nThe mouse is a A4TECH X-708 connected via USB and the keyboard is on PS/2.\n\nA: I had the same problem with a Microsoft keyboard when pressing any special keys like the calc button or the volume controls.

It's inteded for a very specific automation-purpose to behave like that and not meant for Desktop experience ;)\n\nA: There are two files controlling X startup in a standard Ubuntu installation: /etc/init/gdm.conf and /etc/init/failsafe-x.conf.  While the first is owned by package gdm, the second is owned by x11-common and will be triggered if GDM fails to start, which happens in particular when you remove GDM.\nHowever, you need not remove packages to prevent GDM from starting; it enough to tell the upstart system not to start it:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit the /etc/init/gdm.conf and the /etc/failsafe-x.conf files (it might be a good idea to make a backup copy of the files before editing)\n\n*change the existing start on ... stanza with a condition that is not met \nin your standard environment; for instance, you might want to start X only on\n\"runlevel 5\" which is what other Linux distros traditionally did:\nstart on runlevel [5]\n\n\n*save your changes and restart\nComplete documentation on the upstart configuration files can be read by man 5 init.\n\nA: You could do:\nsudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove\n\nThen to restore:\nsudo update-rc.d -f gdm default\n\n\nA: If this is meant for a very specific, non-graphical task, ubuntu-desktop is not what you want.\nI know you shouldn't need to remove things to stop them running but, frankly, you'd do better to grab the Ubuntu Server (or even minimal) CD and start from a low-level.\nYou're driving a tank to work.

I switched from SLES to Ubuntu and now I want to restart my local server.\nIn SLES I used:\nrcapache2 restart\n\nbut this seems not to work in Ubuntu.\nHow do I restart Apache?\n\nA: sudo service apache2 restart for the way that's borrowed from Red Hat.\n\nA: First you check your status using this command \nsudo service apache2 status\n\nthen stop the running service \nsudo service apache2 stop\n\nthen use this command: \nsudo /opt/lampp/lampp start\n\nthis solution has worked for me. \n\nA: You can use the systemctl command for apache service restarting; this controls the systemd system and service manager.\nFor Restarting Apache With systemctl Command:\nsudo systemctl restart apache2.service\n\nIn case of being hung up or getting no response on restarting you can use the systemctl stop command to stop the service then start with the systemctl start command. Commands are as follows -\nFor Stopping Apache With systemctl Command:\nsudo systemctl stop apache2.service\n\nFor Starting Apache With systemctl Command:\nsudo systemctl start apache2.service\n\nYou can also use the reload command for only reloading the apache service.\nFor Reloading Apache With systemctl Command:\nsudo systemctl reload apache2.service\n\n\nA: The recommended way under Ubuntu to start/stop services (not just\nApache) is to use the start/stop/reload commands (which really are\nsymbolic links to the initctl\nprogram, part of upstart).\nFor services that use the legacy /etc/init.d scripts, the\ncorresponding script will be called with the correct parameters; for\nservices that use the upstart infrastructure, the appropriate event\ntransition will be signaled to the\nupstart daemon via\ninitctl.\nSo, to start/stop/reload/restart apache on Ubuntu, you can use:\nsudo start apache2\nsudo stop apache2\nsudo reload apache2\nsudo restart apache2\n\n\nA: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nOf course you can swap out restart for stop, start and (I think) reload\n\nA: you can use services for restarting Apache\nservice apache2 restart\n\nand you can use all functionality for it (Stop - Start - Reload)\n\nA: if you are install Apache 2.4 version in your system, to start restart or stop your Apache server on your local system,then you should run following command\n./apachectl start\n\nor you can use restart, stop also as per your requirement.\nthis is tested code\n\nA: The best way to restart your Apache server is by using the following command:\n$ sudo service apache2 restart\n\nAlter You can use the below command:\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\n\nA: Ubuntu way: \n\n\n*\n\n*To restart:\n\nsudo service apache2 restart|stop|start \n\n\n*To stop:\n\nsudo service apache2 stop \n\n\n*To start:\n\nsudo service apache2 start \n\n\nA: Do you want to restart Apache, or do you want to gracefully reload its configuration?\nEveryone was answering the first question; you can do the second with\nsudo service apache2 reload\n\nGracefully reloading is a bit faster, and there's no downtime.\nThere's one caveat: if your apache config files contain an error (e.g. configures a log file in a directory that doesn't exist), the server may silently exit without printing any error messages to the console.  Most other errors are caught by the apache2ctl configtest that service apache2 reload runs before doing the actual reload with apache2ctl graceful.\n\nA: As Marius said graceful should be used either to restart:\nsudo apache2ctl graceful\n\nor\nsudo apache2ctl graceful-stop\n\nto stop Apache gracefully.\nThese commands wait until all requests for web pages have been served before restarting/stopping the web server so that your user's don't get half a web page.\n\nA: sudo systemctl restart apache2\n\n\nsystemctl - Control the systemd system and service manager.\nsystemctl may be used to introspect and control the state of the\n  \"systemd\" system and service manager.\n\n\nA: if you are root: (In Ubuntu root is disabled, I think, than use 'sudo' command!)\n$ /etc/init.d/apache stop\n$ /etc/init.d/apache start\n$ /etc/init.d/apache restart\n$ /etc/init.d/apache reload \n\n(If you used a2ensite or a2dissite, you have to reload your apache configuration)\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Microsoft Virtual PC Do you have tips or a guide how to install Ubuntu in Microsoft Virtual PC?\nI have found some (older) information, but I wonder if this is still valid.

I could get all the way to the install screen where it checks to see if I have a hard drive with sufficient space and an internet connection, but although it saw my internet connection, it would not recognize my .vhd at all. It said I needed 4.8 gigs of space, but that only ~500 was available (I think it was looking at its own .iso directory on the virtualized D: drive. I tried changing the drive from dynamic to fixed, differing its allocated size - all to no avail.\nUltimately I gave up and tried it with an install of Ubuntu 12.04 - this worked flawlessly, except that I am currently having difficulties with getting internet connected.\nOne thing to note when performing this install - it will look like a crash has occurred during boot; there will be some cryptic lines of text, followed by a black/purple screen with green or other-colored lines on it. It will stay like this for perhaps a few minutes, but it WILL eventually boot and the install (of 12.04) DOES work.\nStep-by-step, this is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded 12.04 \n\n*Created a new virtual machine in Virtual PC,\nallocated 1024mb of RAM to it (4gb on this machine), and gave it a\ndynamic .vhd file.\n\n*Right-click on the .vhd file in Virtual PC, select Settings.\n\n*In settings, under the DVD Drive option, I selected \"Open an ISO image,\" then browsed to my 12.04 .iso file and selected it.\n\n*Selected \"OK\" in the virtual machine settings screen to exit, then started the virtual machine.\n\n*Allowed it to run until the Ubuntu desktop showed up; this took several minutes due to graphical instabilities, but it DID happen.\n\n*Installed as normal, although I wasn't able to connect to the internet.\n\n*After this, it was simply a question of rebooting the machine as linux asked and then using it as you would any virtual machine under Virtual PC. \n\n\nThe two oddities are that internet doesn't work for me, and I can't go fullscreen. If anyone could help with those two problems (or explain why 12.10 won't work), I think this thread could have a complete answer.\nPS - the reason I did this was because virtualbox is not licensed for free usage in a corporate environment, where I was operating.

I have some problems importing my music files in Rhythmbox.\nUnder Preferences -> Music I set the directory hierarchy I want but when I import music from a directory it doesn't copy the files in my music dir. Also if I manually copy the files in my music it imports them but doesn't rename them.\n\nA: Rhythmbox is a music player that allows easy browsing and searching of your music. Audio files (.ogg, .mp3 etc.) have a feature called tags. Tags are small pieces of text that describe the audio file they are in. Examples of tag types are: 'album', 'artist' and 'genre'. \nWhen you import files into your library, Rhythmbox extracts these tags, as well as the location of the file, into its database. It then uses the database to provide the interface that you can use to browse, search and play music. It also allows you to edit the tags in files. Tags replace the semantics of the underlying file hierarchy.\nYour default music location is there for when you rip CDs. CDs don't contain tag information so Rhythmbox looks them up online and then uses your preferences to create the music files on your disk with your preferred naming scheme.\nIf you don't like the way Rhythmbox works, you can install other music players from Ubuntu Software Centre:\n\nAs you can see, there is plenty of choice.\n\nA: About not copying or moving the files, I think this is just how Rhythmbox works (and I prefer it that way, personally, but I know other people prefer it differently).\nI'm not sure what you mean by rename; do you mean automatically rename all files using the filename template based on the tags?  (And I would be really upset if any music manager would rename files without my express permission--this could break other applications--but again, tastes differ ;) ).\nIf Rhythmbox doesn't work like you want, you can also try alternative music managers.  E.g. Banshee is quite popular, and also has a U1MS-plugin if you want to have that, but there are others too.\n", "Q: How does Ubuntu detect hardware? Are there any common actions that user have to do after installing new hardware? Is Ubuntu makes some hardware-dependent adjustments during installation (except generation of /etc/fstab file), that user should do when changing any device, like motherboard, graphic card or other? Methods of detection hardware in Ubuntu is not clear for me. What I can read about it?\nI have not real problems right now, but I would like to know what to do when it happen.\n(PS: Do you understand me? :-) I am not a native english speaker and it is my first experience, please comment my mistakes :-)\n\nA: As Marius says: hardware is detected by the kernel at boot time, or later if it's \"pluggable\" (USB, etc.).  When the hardware is recognized, the related kernel module (driver) will be loaded and in most cases userspace will be notified via dbus/udev to determine what to do with that hardware; udev has a set of \"rules\" that specify what to do with certain types of hardware.  E.g. \"if the detected hardware is an USB printer, add it to the print server (CUPS)\" is an example of such rule, and it would look something like this:\n# Low-level USB device add trigger\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{bInterfaceClass}==\"07\", ATTR{bInterfaceSubClass}==\"01\", RUN+=\"udev-configure-printer add %p\"\n# usblp device add trigger (needed when usblp is already loaded)\nACTION==\"add\", KERNEL==\"lp*\", RUN+=\"udev-configure-printer add %p\"\n\nThe above is part of /lib/udev/rules.d/70-printers.rules (at least, on 10.10), which also includes a rule for removing the printer from CUPS if you unplug it.\nBTW: USB class 7 are USB printers.\nIn some cases you might have to change some configuration files, but that would be considered a bug or a necessary workaround (some hardware is impossible or difficult to detect).\n\nA: As a rule, no.

Unfortunately, the Unity Launcher on the left hand side of the screen takes more valuable space away than the new menu bar gives.\nIs there any way to get rid of the Launcher?\nAlternatives I would be satisfied with include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not having the Launcher at all\n\n*Having the Launcher hide automatically\n\n*Having applications open on top of the Launcher (not next to it)\n\n\n(edit:) Note that I am specifically looking for a way to keep the global menubar, while getting rid of the Launcher.\n\nA: 12.04 and later\nFrom the Gear, choose System Settings\n\nDouble click the Appearance icon\n\nClick the behaviour tab and then toggle the autohide option...\n\nYou can re-reveal the menu by pushing onto the left-hand side of the window or the top corner depending upon which option is shown as per the picture.\n\n\nA: It should be possible to remove unity and use netbook-launcher-efl & ubuntu-netbook-efl-default-settings instead.  This is the 2D version of the old launcher, which allows applications to open over it.\n\nA: You can do what I did and install a third party dock (I used DockBarX, but that isn't the easiest thing to install by itself), have that replace the Unity launcher bar and then comment out the script for the Launcher and change the shell to have a width of zero.\nThe end result is DockBarX with the Unity menu when you press the super key, and all of the other unity things. DockBarX can be replaced with any other dock such as tint or docky or etc etc.\n\n\nTo do this (note: I am running Ubuntu 12.04 so the steps may vary slightly), simply input \n\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/Shell.qml\n\nand edit line 45 as \"width: 0\"\nand\n\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/launcher/Launcher.qml\n\nand add a \" /* \" at the start of line 28 (possibly earlier) and a \" */ \" at the end of line 223.\n\nA: You can effectively remove the launcher through the CompizConfig Settings Manager.  You may need to install it with:\n\napt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nOpen CCSM > Ubuntu Unity Plugin.\nIf you want to simply autohide the toolbar, select \"Autohide\" in the Hide Launcher select box.\nAdditionally, if you wish to prevent it from appearing at all when approaching the edge of the screen, click the Reveal Mode button and deselect any sides it is configured to appear on.  The laucher should be removed completely unless you press the super key.\nThis is tested to work in Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: After upgrading all the way from 10.04, I did not like at all the look of my desktop.\nThe solution above did not work for me.\nHere is my solution:\nInstall gnome (using apt-get or synaptic)\nGo to system > startup applications > add \"gnome-panel\"\nCompletely remove \"unity\" package and unity related packages. This is the one with the launcher.\nLog out and log in again.  You are now with a gnome panel that you can configure as you wish.  If you upgraded from a version where you already had a panel.  It will be already configured.\nNOTE: If you have multiple users on your system, make sure they add gnome-panel to their startup application before you remove unity as administrator.  If not, they will be left with no panel to navigate when they log on.\n\nA: I have went into the CCSM and just turned it to auto hide. This way it is only out when I scroll over it..lol. You can do it in both unity 3d and 2d. You go to Ubuntu Unity Plugin. Then to the behavior tab. Now the hide launcher and click auto hide.

I currently have ubuntu 10.04 (planning on upgrading soon to 10.10) on a server at home with a large music and video collection.\nI own a blackberry bold 9700 on AT&T and an HTC Desire (Android) on US Cellular, and I'd like to be able to listen to music (and perhaps even watch these videos, although this is less important) easily from both of these phones while on the go.\nI've installed subsonic, which is quite nice and does a lot of what I'd like to do, except that using the android app requires paying a license fee that I'd rather avoid by finding a truly free alternative, and simply going through the web interface on either phone's browser is hardly easy or intuitive.\nAny suggestions or ideas would be appreciated.. hearing from people who have already found working solutions for the bold 9700 would be ideal, as this is my primary phone.\n\nA: I use Ampache for web-based music streaming.  They have clients for Android, iPhone and WebOS; they just added a BlackBerry client.  I also believe they have a plugin for Rhythmbox as well.  The Ampache website is here: http://ampache.org/\n\nA: You should check out http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp.\nSubsonic is a really great solution for streaming music of most if not all types across the internet.

Network config is far from obvious from the Gui !\n\nA: You may not be on the same WORKGROUP as your other shares - so a list is unable to be generated.\nTry connecting directly to the share via it's IP address and protocol to ensure you're still able to see and reach any share.\n", "Q: Using % in a cron command Since the % has special meaning to cron, how do I use it as part of a command?\nI found this page http://www.hcidata.info/crontab.htm, which mentions piping echo and sed to escape the % and then remove the extra \\, but in my case, the command is date, which doesn't accept parameters through STDIN, so this doesn't work:\necho '+\\%Y' | sed -e 's|\\\\||g' | date\n\nI'm thinking I can create a special date script that will output the date in the format I want, and call that instead, but I'm still wondering if it's possible to do it directly in the cron command.\nThanks!\n\nA: The crontab(5) man page says:\n\nPercent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (), will be changed\n  into newline characters, [...]\n\nso you should be able to just escape the % character by prefixing it with a backslash \\:\n00 15 * * *  user  date '+\\%Y'\n\nThe \\% sequence is processed by cron, so the shell will see the command date '+%Y' which is a correct invocation of date.\n", "Q: Can I create a 4TB Raid 1+0 volume? I'm thinking about setting up a NAS based on Ubuntu server, but before I invest the money, I want to make sure what I want to do is possible.\nWhat I'm thinking is a 4x2TB Raid 10, so my usable storage will be 4TB.  I'll have a separate 2.5 inch drive that Ubuntu will boot from, and I'm going to use software raid.\nI also want the volume to be usable as a samba share to windows machines on my network.\nWill Ubuntu have any problems with this?  I've heard of the 2TB limit, but it seems Ubuntu is unaffected by this.  I just want to make sure.  Is there a limit to the size of a volume?\n\nA: Every filesystem has limits, and ext2/ext3 were limited to 2 TiB, but ext4 has a much higher limit (that you won't reach anytime soon).  So, use ext4 and you should be safe...\nFor NFS shares I think it depends on the NFS daemon/version you use (check the manuals first) and some certainly have a filesize limit. For Samba it shouldn't be a problem, except with older versions of Windows maybe?\n\nA: All this sounds like it should work fine.\nYou can use Software RAID to create the Raid 10 partition if your hardware doesn't do Hardware RAID.\nThe only issue that you might face is that /boot can only exist within a Software RAID 1, so if you are using Software RIAD you may well need to create a seperate /boot partition outside of the RAID. If you are using hardware obviously this is redundant.\nThe size limits for partitions are imposed by the filesystem itself and if you are using ext4 (the default for Ubuntu) the size limit ofr partitions is 1 Exbibyte so you should be fine ;)\n\nA: You may have some driver - issues, but I've found my way around them.  I figured I'd be ok purchasing an EVGA motherboard -- still had issues with the ICH10R.  But I've found that this community is very helpful in troubleshooting issues if & when they arise.\n\nA: I did almost the same setup recently, but I used 2 RAID1 mirror sets which I joined in 1 LVM volume, that makes it easy to add more disks to the LVM volume later, I don't know how easy this would be with RAID10. But this solution works fine for me.\nComment regarding RAID10 vs RAID1+LVM are welcome.\n", "Q: True column-mode (block-selection and editing) text editor solution? In windows, I used to use a text editor called crimson editor which featured the best column-mode editing support I have yet to use.\nWhen enabled via a simple Alt-C shortcut, selections could be made with the mouse or cursor keys and they would be visual blocks rather than wrapped-lines.\nThese selections could be deleted, moved, copied, pasted, and all of the operations just made sense. You could also just start typing, and you'd get a column of the characters as you're typing.\nThere are multiple ways of getting parts of the these features working separately discussed on this forum thread, but no one has yet to provide a solution that provides this all-encompassing and easy-to-use method.\nIf someone could point me to a gedit plugin where this work is actively being pursued, perhaps I could help with the coding myself. If someone is aware of a text editor that already provides this full functionality, I'd appreciate the info.  Running crimson editor through wine and the close-but-not-quite multi-edit plugin for gedit are the temporary solutions I'm 'getting by with' for the time being.\nUPDATE (2012-11): I'm now a very happy user of sublime text.  It supports excellent column-mode editing and works on all three major OS platforms without any issue.  Highly recommended!\n\nA: You do use the Eclipse editor. Alt+Shift+A should do what you need.\n\nA: nedit  \nI use NEdit all the time.\nTo install it using the terminal, use the following command:\nsudo apt-get install nedit\n\nOld school (Motif) but has tabs and is lightweight and simple. Has context highlighting included for a number of coding languages, and more can be added.\nPressing Ctrl while dragging with the mouse enables a block of text to be selected.\nThen you can copy/paste as usual. Couldn't do without this feature now.\n\nA: geany \nis an integrated development environment that provides good column editing support which is worth checking out (an example here)\nSimply put, press down Alt+Shift instead of just Shift while making selections to invoke column mode. One important limitation is that the edits in column mode are (as yet) not undo-able.\nTo achieve the same with the mouse, hold down Ctrl while selecting. This actually works with most Scintilla-based editors (including SciTE and Geany).\n\nA: To edit columns, I use vi / gvim.  It takes a bit of learning to get used to vi, but in the end many people find this to be their preferred editor.\nSpecifically within vi you can use CTRL V to highlight columns in visual mode, then you can edit it as you would expect.  I use this all the time for adding and removing comments, or indenting functions i.e. CTRL V (highlight a column) SHIFT I # ESC will comment out that entire column.\n\nA: Use a gEdit with gmate and plugins. You'll get the TextMate of Linux.\nsudo apt-get install gedit gedit-plugins\ncd ~/Downloads\ngit clone http://github.com/gmate/gmate.git\ncd gmate\nsh ./install.sh\n\nWith this \"slight\" modification gEdit really rocks.\n\nA: This is possible in emacs, and it's easy if you use the cua-mode. C-return marks the upper left of the rectangle. Then move the cursor to highlight the rectangular region.\n\n\n*\n\n*Here's a video that shows how to do it:\nhttp://vimeo.com/1168225\n\n*And see section \"CUA rectangle support\" here:\nhttp://www.cua.dk/cua.html\nThe emacs column mode features are really cool. They go far beyond just copy/paste of rectangular text. Check out the video for a demo of how to simultaneously edit all the lines in the column! Very handy!\nIf you don't want to watch the video (or can't) here are the bare basics:\n\nCUA-mode's superior rectangle support is based on using a true visual representation of the selected rectangle. To start a rectangle, use [S-return] and extend it using the normal movement keys (up, down, left, right, home, end, C-home, C-end). Once the rectangle has the desired size, you can cut or copy it using C-x and C-c, and you can subsequently insert it - as a rectangle - using C-v. So the only new command you need to know to work with CUA-mode rectangles is S-return! \n\nOn Kubuntu 12.04 and emacs v24, [S-return] is CONTROL-RETURN (CTRL-ENTER) for me.\nAs already mentioned, Scite has this built-in (no plug-ins needed). It's very easy to use. And Scite is in the Ubuntu repos.\n\nRectangular blocks of text can be selected in SciTE by holding down the Alt key on Windows or the Ctrl key on GTK+ while dragging the mouse over the text.\n\n\nA: Also Notepadqq can do this: they briefly present the feature in their page. Hold down Alt, then hold Ctrl or Shift, and select the \"columns\" you want by dragging (or also clicking, if you are holding Ctrl) with the mouse. Release the buttons when you are done selecting columns, and start editing by typing, using arrow keys, copy-paste (a mouse click will cancel the multi-selection).\nThe points you select don't need to form a real column, it's an arbitrary number of cursors active at same time. When you copy-paste, the text is pasted cursor-by-cursor if the number of copied and pasted ones matches, otherwise every target cursor gets a full copy of the input.\nLittle nuisances: you can't de-select single cursors while keeping the others, and you can't use the keyboard to select them  (or at least, I don't know how to).\n\nA: Paste this commands in terminal    \nsudo sed -i.backup -r '/^#\\s?deb\\s?(http|ftp|-src).*(partner|multiverse|universe)/s/^#\\s?//g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get -y vim-gnome vim-doc\n\nvim yourfile\n\nIn vim use:\nctrl-v ....... to select in mode column\nj ............ to down \n\nsee: \n :help\n\n\nA: KWrite, Kate and KDevelop also support this. It's a bit different in them in that column edit mode works not via modifier keys, but as a mode that you turn on and off. These three programs have different feature level but are based on the same editor component.\n\nA: Yes, you can achieve it with the Gedit plugin multi edit. This blog post explains it.\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo apt install gedit-plugin-multi-edit\n\n*Press Ctrl + Shift + C to enter Multi-Edit Mode. It will reflect in upper right corner.\n\n*Make the desired selection, and hit Enter. Boom!, it's gone now, then you can edit multiple rows but in column mode.\n\nBonus: Use Ctrl + E, when in Multi-Edit Mode and click at various points (which you want to edit at same time). this way you can edit multiple lines based on words.\n", "Q: Problem upgrading from Ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10 I've been trying to upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10.\nDuring the package installing and upgrade process there were numerous packages which threw errors but it continued installing.  The last one to fail was squid, when this failed the upgrade manager quit-out without finishing everything.  When I restarted I get a Kernel Panic error:\nKernel Panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)\nPid: 1, comm: swapper Not tainted 2.6.35-22-generic #33-Ubuntu\n\nSimilar to the question asked here.\nAt the grub loader I tried to boot to 2.5.32 but this drops into an incomplete command-line (BusyBox) with limited commands with the error: udevadmn trigger is not permitted while udev is unconfigured\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will help anyone else but this is the process I had to go through ... and my thoughts as to why:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup all data\n\n*Unplug my external drive\n\n*Re-install a fresh 10.10\n\n*Copy data back\n\n\nEvery time I tried to install 10.10 with my external drive plugged in it would choose the external drive as the default install location.  I would change it to my internal drive and then install as normal.  However, after re-boot it would have the issues mentioned above.  On a lark I tried installing after unplugging the drive.  Everything worked out fine.\nThanks for the help everyone and I hope that this answer helps someone else.\n\nA: If you've got a separate home partition, I would suggest you reinstall Ubuntu over the current root partition. \nMake sure you get your mount points correct (don't forget to make sure that /home/ is not going to get formatted) and if you've got multiple users, don't change the order of the users (ensure the person whose home dir is owned by 1000 is added as admin, then add the person whose directory is owned by 1001, etc). \nI've often had trouble upgrading from one version to another and prefer fresh installs to upgrades. Also when things go this bad, there are probably too many problems that you will need to fix (if at all they can be fixed) before you get your system work as you'd like it too.\nIf you have some valuable information about this problem, I would suggest reporting a bug.\n\nA: If you're familiar with the command line, you can use an Ubuntu Live CD, open a terminal and chroot into your system in order to finish the upgrade. More or less, the commands you'll have to type are the following:\nsudo mount /dev/your-root-partition /somewhere\nsudo chroot /somewhere\ndpkg --configure -a\n\n\nA: I'm afraid that the simplest way is to copy /home directory to external drive and reinstall system. \nI also recommend separate partition for /home dir. The most critical time in upgrade is when package manager has downloaded all files and before finish of configuration. When You have error there that's very bad situation.\n", "Q: Why does my panel drawer not work properly? I used the add to panel applet to add a 'drawer' of common shortcuts to my gnome-panel, but when I click on the drawer icon, it only pops up far enough to see one icon until I mouse over it and hover there for a second or two.\nThen, it finally expands the rest of the way so I can click on the other icons.\nHow can I fix this annoyance?\n\nA: It's probably bug #108951. You'll note that a patch is attached to comment #62.\n", "Q: why would /etc/init.d/mysql run the wrong upstart job? update: /lib/init/upstart-job has been replaced with the MongoDB init script.\nFor some reason, /etc/init.d/mysql start|stop|restart|status (/etc/init.d/mysql is simply a symlink to /lib/init/upstart-job) is affecting my MongoDB install, not my MySQL install. service start|stop|restart|status mysql works as you'd expect.\nAn example:\nroot@score:~# /etc/init.d/mysql status\n * Checking status of database MongoDB\n   ...fail!\nroot@score:~# \n\nWhat could cause this, and how can I fix it?\nScripts:\n\n\n*\n\n*/lib/init/upstart-job: http://paste.ubuntu.com/517647/\n\n*/etc/init/mysql.conf: http://paste.ubuntu.com/517648/\n\n*/etc/init/mongodb.conf: http://paste.ubuntu.com/517649/\n\nA: The correct contents of /lib/init/upstart-job for lucid or maverick are http://paste.ubuntu.com/517673/\nPlease triple-check that it is a regular file before editing this, and not a symlink (in case the symlink in in the wrong direction). Since this file is used for starting many core services, you do not want to have it broken further, and should check carefully before rebooting.\nAt this stage, I'm not sure how it could have the different contents unless there was some manual intervention to change it. The package in maverick appears to contain the correct symlink.\n", "Q: Should I upgrade to 10.10 now or wait a while longer? I use netbook edition of Ubuntu and I am quite happy. Should I migrate now?\n\nA: The answer is really: it depends.\nIf you are very happy with all the software you are using now, and you are using your netbook very regularly, I would not see any reason to update now (or even in the future). You can just stick to the LTS versions.\nOn the other hand, if you like me want to have the newest software, or just a piece of software that is not available for your version, it is ok to upgrade. The upgrades of ubuntu are really smooth and the change of breaking something  is not big. There is however a change, so just weigh your risks.\nFor now, there is really a new interface for the netbook. I would suggest using a live-usb to test the new version whether you like it or not and decide based on that.\n\nA: Not everybody likes the new Unity netbook interface, so you might want to test it first from a live medium (live-CD or live-USB).\nOtherwise, upgrading should be fine, although some people prefer to wait a couple of weeks (some bugs found around or after the release will be fixed by then).\n", "Q: How best to upgrade on netbook without lot of space? I dont have a lot of space on my netbook. My 8GB drive is now almost full with about 250MB space. What is the best way to upgrade to Ubuntu 10.10? Will I have to download a lot of files? Can I use an USB drive for the upgrade?\nOr is the best way to free up some space and upgrade as normal?\n\nA: Freeing up some space is anyway advisable.\nBut yes, you can also download the iso and make a live-usb. Then you can upgrade your ubuntu from the packages on the usb-drive (just start the installer, it will offer to upgrade)\nFor me it took around 1GB downloading to upgrade (I had quite some packages installed), so I think 250 MB will indeed not be enough for you.\n\nA: I you are having problems with a small storage space, you might want to look into Lubuntu. Lubuntu is a faster, more lightweight and energy saving variant of Ubuntu using LXDE, the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment. It is available from their site and is upgraded to version 10.10.\n\n\nA: This question will continually re-appear. Limited permanent storage: so perhaps install onto & run from a USB or flash card instead off the limited space on the PC hardware.\nIn Australia, most Linux distros install foreign languages, so I tediously remove them. Some install themes, wallpapers, lots of sample files (movies, sounds, pictures, fonts, etc). So - tediously remove these as well.\nIf you use a 'buntu running LXDE, this helps. When installing, do not allow Internet update whilst installing, because you have little control on the updates it will install.\nNetbooks might run Atom (32bit) or I3 processors. Choose 32bit operating systems. If you have more than 3.5 GB of RAM memory on your motherboard, check that your op system is 32bit PAE. 64-bit apps, etc are usually more space demanding.\nAfter the non-Internet install, use the inbuil upddater, or Synaptic to selectively choose what parts you will upgrade. On a small PC, you cannot do everything promised; only a few tasks.  So add your preferred apps rather than the ones that have been supplied.  Remove the unused apps; perhaps Transmision (torrent), Libreoffice and/or Abiword, etc.\nWith light usage, you can let 'buntu decide the size of your temporary and other folders, so just let it default install everything into the Root (/) directory.\nMost netbooks need or allow wireless netweorks. So your might want to add wireless network apps: signal strength, security, etc. 'Sentinella' and hibernate apps might help as well, since these are rarely installed on most Linux distros, which are designed for desktop-type computers and servers.\n", "Q: How to prevent package removal upon upgrade to new Ubuntu version? I have upgraded to Ubuntu 10.10 from 10.04, but the upgrade removed some of my packages that I had manually installed. These package (Dekiwiki from Mindtouch amongst others) are not supported by Canonical.\nThe removal of this packages resulted in the removal of my website. Off course this is my responsibility, but how can I prevent such things from happening in the future?\n\nA: On servers, you should always review the upgrade process and which packages are being offered for removal.\nUbuntu's upgrade process usually doesn't remove packages for no reason. Possibly it was due to dependency issues with other packages. Unfortunately, without access to logfiles it's not easy to find out the specific reason why your packages have been removed. Depending on the mechanism you used to commence your upgrade, you should find logfiles in /var/log documenting the upgrade process.\n\nA: If what you mean is that you want APT to prefer a certain package version over another ( keep older version and not install/upgrade to new version) take a look at \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto\n", "Q: No WiFi on HP Netbook 2133 After installation of 10.10 in my HP Mini 2133.

Windows XP pro S3 is already installed on my laptop HP EliteBook 6930p. I am trying to partition and dual boot. This is all new to me as this is my first time installing Ubuntu. Partition is the most confusing part, it shows up 160GB with NTFS file format and a blank /sdv(or something). I can't resize the 160GB, had to select the blank option and click Add. When i do this the NTFS becomes free space?? I dont want Windows XP to be overwritten.\nI have seen videos and read documentation online but they are all reference to older Ubuntu version. Nothing simple for this noob :)\nObjective\n-Dual boot with Windows Xp an Ubuntu 10.10\n-partition the drive, with swap, ext4, fat32(transfer files between Ubuntu and Windows XP), and NTFS(keep Windows XP)\n\nA: Well, in 10.10 installation is very easy. First download Ubuntu 10.10. Burn it on a CD or in a USB Stick with Unetbootin. Then simply boot the CD or the USB and select Install Ubuntu. \nIn the installation there is an option for dual boot installation in a simple way.\n\n\nA: After intensive troubleshooting I have come up with the following solution. I am running Ubuntu on vmware. The issue was initially with HDD encryption software called PointSec. This prevented the HDD from being partitioned. Encrypting and decrypting took 2 days to complete. Once done, Gparted found 6 bad sectors on the disk. Tried, chkdsk and spinrite tool to recover the bad sector. With the bad sector, Gparted wouldn't let me partition the HDD. I am came to the conclusion to install VMware player and run Ubuntu from it. I would like to thank everyone for your help.\n\nA: Let me point you to the great wiki guide: Dual Boot Ubuntu and Windows\nYou will probably want 3 partitions, that all need to fit in your 160GB of space:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows (NTFS)\n\n*Ubuntu (Ext4)\n\n*Ubuntu Swap (temporary storage)\n\n\nYou can use the Ubuntu partition manager, if you boot off of a live CD, to reduce the size of your current NTFS partition, as described in the link above (Control Panel -> Administrative tools -> Computer Management -> Disk Management).  \nYou should be able to install almost automagically once you get the NTFS partition resized.\n\nA: U can do all of the Hard Drive Re-sizing, Partitioning without loosing data using a Propitiatory Software for windows with which u can literally control Ur NTFS/FAT Partitions.

A fair while ago (~ 2004) I was told to always create a separate partition for the boot directory.  And since then I always have.  But after reading a few questions about partitioning questions, I'm curious.  Do I still need a /boot partition?\nNote:  If helpful, I'm dual booting (Win XP or 7) & Ubuntu 10.04.  I also have one partition (using ext2/3) which I use to share files between the two operating systems.\n\nA: This response probably answers your question:\n\nGenerally speaking, you shouldn't bother with a separate /home or\n  /boot partition unless you're running multiple Linux distributions\n  at once.\nThe Ubuntu installers for both the desktop CD and server/alternate CD\n  have the ability to install over an existing system, preserving your\n  home directory (and the local system driectories: /usr/local,\n  /usr/src, and /var/local).  This functionality also reuses the\n  user ID and group ID of an existing user, if it has the same username\n  as the user you're creating during installation.\nTo use this option when installing, choose the option for advanced\n  partitioning, then select your existing / or /home partition.  In\n  the box that appears, make sure the filesystem selected matches the\n  existing filesystem of that partition, and that the format box is not\n  checked.  Proceed as normal through the rest of the options.\nIn Ubuntu 10.10 we had hoped to add an option to the installer that\n  detected when you had an existing copy of Ubuntu installed and offered\n  to replace it with the newer version you were attempting to install\n  (using the aforementioned functionality behind the scenes).  While it\n  did not make the final cut, it is likely to arrive in Ubuntu 11.04.\nAs for a separate /boot partition, that's a relic of hardware\n  constraints of the past (the bootloader 1024 cylinder limit).  I can\n  think of no practical advantage a separate /boot would have on a\n  modern system, and if not given an arguably excessive amount of space,\n  it will potentially fill up and create problems of its own, given that\n  Ubuntu does not automatically remove old kernels.\n\n\nA: If you don't use LVM, root volume encryption, software RAID, etc., and otherwise just have your root volume on a plain-jane filesystem with no intermediate layers, then you don't need it.\nReally, the most important files in booting are the kernel image (vmlinuz) and the initramfs image (initrd.img). If both of those (and the GRUB configuration files) are accessible by GRUB with no special handling, then a separate /boot volume is not necessary.\n\nA: Generally speaking, unless you're dealing with encryption, or RAID, you don't need a separate /boot partition.\nThat said, I occasionally find a use for adding a separate /boot partition as a FAT partition.  This allows your dual-boot system to make alterations to your GRUB config, so you can create a batch file to shut down windows and alter the default menu choice so that it boots something else next.  Most people don't need this, but I've had a few projects which required switching back and forth, and it allows it to be done entirely by script.\n", "Q: Laptop immediately suspends when going onto battery power I've got an MSI Wind, model U100 that's been running Ubuntu without trouble for a long while. After upgrading to 10.04 a few months ago, I've had this strange problem. As soon as I unplug the laptop from the power source I get the warning dialog telling me that my battery is critically low, and the laptop suspends, regardless of what the battery level actually is. If I then turn the laptop back on, it runs fine and shows the correct battery level.\nI've been working around this by manually suspending before switching to battery power, but I'm wondering if anyone else knows the cause or a fix.\n\nA: I think this thread talks about this issue.\nThere's also a bug report on Lanchpad that may apply. See comment #4.\nAs a kludgy work-around, I turned off auto-hybernate by putting the following command into my /etc/rc.local file.\ngconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/gnome-power-manager/general/use_time_for_policy false\nOn the downside, if I forget to plug in my computer it just dies after the battery is spent.\n\nA: This is still an issue in 11.10 (beta 2 with kernel 3.0.0-12-generic) but the location has moved. See this post to fix for 11.10.\nWhere do I set use_time_for_policy?\n", "Q: Provide driver on removable media during installation? During installation if the installer is unable to detect any disks it will present you a list of all the available drivers to select or you can select none of these.  Once you select that it gives you a couple of options.  One of them is to scan removable media for a driver.  \nDoes anyone know what it's looking for?  I've tried just putting the proper .ko file on a floppy in / as well as putting it in /lib/modules/<kernel version>/kernel/extras/ and a few other places but in the end I have to manually mount the removable media and load the module using insmod.\n\nA: If you're using the desktop CD installer, you can load additional drivers programmatically by  following the instructions here.\nIf you're using the alternate CD installer, you can accomplish this by creating a driver injection disk.  First create a USB disk with a label of OEMDRV, then put a Debian package on it containing your kernel module.  Finally, preseed driver-injection-disk/load to true and start the install.\nThe definitive reference for this format is the hw-detect code, bzr branch lp:hw-detect , specifically driver-injection-disk.sh\nAlternatively, if you want a quick and dirty solution and assuming this is a disk driver, put the kernel module in one of the following directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*/lib/modules/*/kernel/drivers/ide\n\n*/lib/modules/*/kernel/drivers/scsi\n\n*/lib/modules/*/kernel/drivers/block\n\n\nA: In addition to Evan's answer about the alternate installer, this drivers disk should contain *.udeb files for the installer to recognise these. These packages can be found on Ubuntu packages: linux source.\nIf you have a *.ko file, copy it to an USB stick.\nI missed the JMicron Ethernet driver jme.ko and found this module in the kernel-image-2.6.38-8-generic package. This package can be extracted using dpkg-deb -x [name-of-deb-file].deb target_extraction_directory.\nWithin the installer, press Ctrl + Alt + F2 followed by Enter to open a shell. USB sticks won't mount themselves, after locating the disk, mount it:\nmount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\n\nCopy the file to the kernel directory:\ncp /mnt/jme.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/net/\n\nUpdate the kernel modules, unmount the USB stick and load the kernel module (and its dependencies if any):\ndepmod -a\numount /mnt\nmodprobe jme\n\nIf everything went well, you should not get any messages and can go back to the installer menu by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1.\nImportant: the kernel versions of the installer and module must match. My alternate CD did not contain the JMicron Ethernet driver (jme.ko). I could not find it in the *-modules-* files, but it was existent in the linux-image-* package. For easiness, I copied this module from an other computer, forgetting that Maverick was installed on it, and not Natty. I kept getting the ERROR: File not found message and after some time I realised that the module came from Maverick with kernel version 2.6.35-28 but Natty runs on 2.6.38-8.\n", "Q: Replacing vi by vim How do I replace vi by vim so that when I type vi in terminal vim is opened?\n\nA: In addition to what Peter Smit has suggested.  You can do the following as well to make that change system wide rather than just your account.\nadd alias vi='vim' to /etc/bash.bashrc\nor create a symlink to vim\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/vim /usr/bin/vi\nHowever on my system both /usr/bin/vim and /usr/bin/vi are symlinks to /etc/alternatives/vim\n\nA: 'vi' in Ubuntu already starts 'vim', although by default it starts 'vim-tiny' (which comes closest to the original 'vi' in its (lack of) features).  You can see this with:\nsudo update-alternatives --display vi\n\nIf you want it to use another version of vim, then make sure it's installed and run:\nsudo update-alternatives --config vi\n\n\nA: You can add\nalias vi=vim\n\nto ~/.bashrc . This will start vim whenever you type vi.\nNote that in Ubuntu 10.10 (and I think also 10.04) vi is already mapped to vim.\n", "Q: Wubi Install for Mac OS X I just installed Ubuntu 10.10 on my Windows 7 box using Wubi and I'm loving it so far. One feature that I love is the fact that because I used Wubi it doesn't seem to create a separate partition. Through what I can only imagine is some VM magic Windows and Ubuntu live together on the same hard drive without a partition and you can even access Windows files from within Ubuntu and visa versa. I also have a MacBook and I would love to be able to install Ubuntu on the MacBook as well but I don't want to surrender a portion of my disk space to a different operating system. Is there currently a way to do the whole Wubi VM \"virtual partition\" on a Mac?\n\nA: This was originally planned as 'Mubi' , but I haven't seen any evidence it is being worked on.\nIf your Mac is reasonably fast you could try a virtualisation solution, for instance using VirtualBox - but this is unlikely to run as fast as with Wubi.\n\nA: The development of a Mac Ubuntu installer is currently blocked by the lack of journalling write support in the HFS+ filesystem driver.\nAs Mubi obviously needs to write to the Mac filesystem, and most Macs come with HFS+ journalling turned on, this functionality needs to be present in the Linux kernel before development work on Mubi can begin in earnest.\n\nA: You can certainly run Ubuntu on the Virtualbox if you have it installed on Mac or Windows. you can allow sharing of files via \"virtual networking\" between the host and the VM.\n\nA: You can always boot to a Live CD to try it out before investing time and effort with using Boot Camp Assistant. I've used it to install before and it worked just fine. Getting rid of the partitions wasn't fun. Luckily I had Time Machine so just erased all partitions and restored from Time Machine instead of finding a resolution :)\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no Mac version as yet, but developers are still working on Mubi\nwubi faq says\n\nWubi will run on on all Windows versions from Windows 98 to Windows\n  Vista except Windows ME. More platforms to come soon. Linux/*nix/*BSD\n  are supported through Lubi, and Mac OSX\n  will eventually be supported through Mubi (developers still needed).\n\nLaunchpad says\n\nI'll try to reuse as much code as possible, while making things as\n  mac-like as I can and use as much stuff available natively on the mac\n  as possible. Please note however that due to lack of proper write\n  support for journalized hfs+ in the linux kernel (which is the default\n  file system on all new macs for some time now) it will try to use os x\n  online resizing to make a partition that can be used for installation\n  and set everything up to boot from a .iso and install. Failing that\n  (because of low disk space or fragmentation (which for example can\n  oocur if you have too low disk space and osx/hfs+' \"auto-organization\"\n  doesn't work anymore) it won't work.\n\nMeans the project is not simple ,so try to install ubuntu as a dual boot or in vitualbox\n\nA: I don't think there is a Wubi on Mac OS X.  I have Ubuntu 11.10 on my 24\" iMac and runs great.  I burnt an Ubuntu CD.  I installed rEFIt.\nI used 'Disk Utility' on my Mac to resize partition on HD.  I shrunk Mac OS X to 100 gigs and made the other partition 399 gigs (type MSDOS and named LINUX) with a 1 gig swap. Or you can just resize the Mac OS X to 100 gigs and do the rest with the Ubuntu installer.  I rebooted my Mac and at rEFIt menu I chose the disk to boot from. Once Ubuntu was at desktop, I did a normal install.  At partition part, make sure to select your 399 gig partition, set it as '/' and continue.  Don't do or change anything on any other partition. You are warned!  After install, reboot into your new Ubuntu.  The only problem I had was with sound and that was easily fixed here.\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: Can I recover the `~/` short-cut? I upgraded to 10.10 on Sunday, from 10.04, and while the upgrade went smoothly (and I really like Maverick so far) I've somehow lost the ~/ short-cut.

Also, the Firefox help page on keyboard shortcuts says, \"Firefox does not provide any method of customizing keyboard shortcuts.\" (It also shows you can use either Ctrl+K or Ctrl+J on Linux versions, but not Ctrl+E.)\nHowever, there is a way to do it! There is an extension for Firefox (and other XULRunner applications) called Keyconfig (install). According to the MozillaZine post on the subject:\n\nkeyconfig adds the ability to create new or modify existing shortcuts defined by a  element, but only changing those which itself call a function (those with a command or oncommand attribute) has an effect (all others fulfill only cosmetic purposes it seems and are grayed out).\nThe configuration screen can be accessed via Tools > Keyconfig (in most Applications) or Ctrl+Shift+F12 (Command+Shift+F12 on MacOS) from the main window.\n[...]\nDon't think that changing a  will always remove the original shortcuts.

How can I install thoses without using the GUI tool that comes with Ubuntu?\n\nA: jockey is the tool used in Ubuntu to manage 3rd party drivers, particularly proprietary ones like the Nvidia drivers. In addition to the gui tool, it has a text based utility for manipulating drivers as well, jockey-text from the jockey-common package. To list what drivers jockey thinks are available for your hardware use  jockey-text --list; e.g.:\njockey-text --list\n\nreturns (on my system with an ATI graphics chipset):\nxorg:fglrx - ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver (Proprietary, Disabled, Not in use)\nTo then enable it, do sudo jockey-text -e DRIVER, thus in my case, to enable the fglrx driver, I'd do sudo jockey-text -e xorg:fglrx.\nSee jockey-text --help for more information (sadly, there doesn't appear to be a man page for it).\n\nA: nvidia-xconfig will write a new default configuration file.

It can still talk directly to NetworkManager for\n             manipulating these connections.  As nmcli doesn't have direct\n             access to user configuration data in GConf, nm-applet handles that\n             itself.  That may, for example, cause the applet to pop up keyring\n             dialogs when secrets are needed.\n\nFrom my understanding this means you cannot see user connections without having nm-applet running (it works fine for system wide connections).\n\nA: I think nmcli is included in Network-Manager since version 0.8... Just install network-manager and type in man nmcli to see how nmcli works.\n", "Q: Hangs on Splash Screen after login (auto-login), how can I fix this?

Yey!\n\nA: Try setting nautilus back to its default settings. login on a TTY (CTRL+ALT+F1) and run this:\ngconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/nautilus\n\nThis will undo all custom settings for nautilus but should correct your problem.\n", "Q: Will all my settings be kept if I update from to the next version of Ubuntu? I'm very new to Linux; I've been using Lucid for about 5 months and really like it. What is the best way to update to Maverick without losing all my settings? Will just running the update manager actually do a full kernel update?\n\nA: Yes! Your settings for the most part are stored in your home directory. Any changes required by the upgrade outside of this are fairly minimal and will be handled by the upgrade process (NTP, Network, etc).\n\nA: Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu community!\nYes if you update using the Update Manager you should not lose any of your settings.\nHowever if you did a 'clean install' from downloading a CD and installing, you would lose your settings (and files) by default.\n\nA: Please read this\ninformation regarding upgrade.\nIn a nutshell, you won't loose your personal stuff.\n\nA: You can always upgrade from one version to the next, on the fly and without loosing anything. If you've installed software from \"outside of Ubuntu\", such as PPAs, compiled from source or some other installer, then you might have to reinstall after the upgrade. \nPersonal data is never touched. Personal settings are not changed if you've changed them yourself, unless of course it is necessary for the system to work, but in that case, you'll be notified in advance. It is very rare, though, and it's very unlikely to happen when upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04 since the big transition is behind us. \nIn addition to being able to upgrade from one version to the next, you can also upgrade from LTS to the next LTS, such as from 10.04 to 12.04 and from 12.04 to 14.04, eventually. \n", "Q: Nvidia driver causing flickering in menu? Like many Ubuntu users I'm using Compiz Desktop Effects with Gnome. However since Ubuntu 10.10 I've noticed that the zoom effect on my drop down menus i.e. The gnome menu bar have a flicking thin white border when they are opened. It appears very briefly and flickers each time a drop down menu is opened.\nI can't remember this happening on Ubuntu 10.04 and it doesn't seem to be theme specific, as I tried it on Ambiance and Radiance and still see the flicking white border.\nI'm using the nvidia-current proprietary driver enabled through Additional Drivers menu.\nThanks for any help on the matter!\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure \"Sync to vblank\" is checked in \"OpenGL Settings\" in nvidia-settings\n\n*In CompizConfig Settings Manager, make sure your actual refresh rate is set in \"General Options > Display Settings > Refresh Rate\", \"Sync to vblank\" is checked, and \"Detect Refresh Rate\" is unchecked.\n\n", "Q: Apt-get couldn't find package I have encountered this error several times lately on both Ubuntu Server/Desktop.

On commandline this can be done with\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIn the GUI package-managers, I believe should be an option like update packages or something like that, which does the same.\n\nA: To install the Ubuntu Gnome (GUI) Desktop you want to enter in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\n", "Q: Transferring Libraries from Windows 7 into Wine I was wondering if I would be able to transfer my libraries from my Windows 7 partition to Wine. I am pretty sure this is legal because I would be using the libraries from a Windows installation that I payed money for.\nEven if this is possible would it create any benefits? If so, would I be able to run any Windows application I want?\n\nA: The legality of this is fairly cloudy, but ultimately you're not going to get in trouble over it.\nYou will sometimes find that the Wine Application Database tells you to copy certain libraries over to get an individual program to work. In these circumstances there are some clear benefits (you get a working program!), but the majority of the time you should find no need to.\n\nA: Wine can make use of some native DLLs, however in general you don't want to do this preemptively.  Wine's built in libraries often work, and in some cases the native (from Windows) versions don't work when used in their place.\nThat said, there are times when native DLLs will make an application run, however in such situations there's usually a specific winetricks command that will work better.  Unless you're really into Wine tinkering and want to debug particular issues by swapping in/out native dlls, your best bet is to just leave your Windows installation alone unless you receive specific instructions otherwise.\n", "Q: Warnings when restarting apache I setup a LAMP in Ubuntu 10.10 and it seems to be working fine but a couple of things are weird.

IIRC you can resolve the warning by entering a hostname in the configuration file in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nA: This is what worked for me when I had the same warnings\nOpen your Apache config:\nsudo vi /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nAnd add the line:\nServerName localhost\n\n\nA: If you have already set a ServerName in the configuration, make sure that the host name resolves to an IP via DNS or is in your /etc/hosts file.\n", "Q: What screenshot tools are available? I have noticed that many people use images in their Ask Ubuntu answers. What software are people using?\n\nA: I use GNOME Screenshot, but for the sake of the reference and for all the old timers you can use xwd from the command line:\nFor a screenshot of your entire screen:\nxwd -root | convert xwd:- out.png\n\n\nA: I use GIMP. It has a nice tool which allows you to pause (to move it out of the way) and to select just a portion of the window. Usually I crop or edit a screenshot after taking it, so I want to be in GIMP anyway.\n\n\nA: GNOME Screenshot \nI find the GNOME screenshot tool to be the most effective of all. And it is installed by default!\nMy favorite is the use of shortcuts to quickly generate images. For example - Print Screen which takes the entire desktop and Alt+Print Screen for the current focused window.\nFurthermore the interface is extremely simple and powerful for such a small tool.\n\nIt provides nearly the same functionality as the Snipping Tool in Windows via the Select area to grab option, but you can also make a screenshot of a window without the window frame and shadow.\n\nA: GNOME Screenshot does the job fine for me, but there is also ImageMagick for CLI-oriented folks:\nimport screenshot.png\nimport -window root screenshot.jpg\n\nBut, same as xwd, it will not work well with Compiz.\n\nA: There is also Nanoshot - more simple than Shutter.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nanoshot/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nanoshot\n\n\nA: There is ksnapshot from KDE. Well, to me, this one is the winner because you can select whether you want a screenshot of a specific window, whether you want to have the mouse cursor visible and so on.  \nMoreover, it should not be forgotten that gnome-screenshot requires lots of \"alien\" components to be installed. So if you don't have said components installed, gnome-screenshot will bail out with the following ugly error message (under Ubuntu and its \"remixes\"):\n** Message: Unable to use GNOME Shell's built-in screenshot interface, resorting to fallback X11.\n\n\nA: It is simpler with the Compiz plugin called screenshot.\nOpen the CompizConfig Setting Manager, search for the screenshot plugin, and activate it.\nTo use it, hold down the windows key (super key), click and drag the screen that you want to grab, release, and KAZAM, your screenshot on the desktop.\nFor a video and tutorial, see Shawn Powers' LinuxJournal article Quick Compiz Screenshots.\n\nA: Since Ubuntu 14.04, including 16.04, and 18.04, simply press\n\n\n*\n\n*Prt Scrn to take a screenshot of the desktop,\n\n*Alt+Prt Scrn to take a screenshot of a window, \n\n*Shift+Prt Scrn to take a screenshot of an area you select.\n\n\nThe screenshots will be saved to ~/Pictures.\nIt is included in Official Documentation online help, Ubuntu Stable: Tips & Tricks: [Screenshots and Screencasts] 4.\n\nA: Flameshot\nA powerful open source screenshot and annotation tool for Linux, Flameshot has a varied set of editing tools available, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Freehand drawing\n\n*Lines\n\n*Arrows\n\n*Boxes\n\n*Circles\n\n*Highlighting\n\n*Blur\n\n*Save image, or upload to Cloud (Imgur), or copy to clipboard\n\n*Add Text (Available in version 0.6 )\n\nYou can customize the color, size and/or thickness of many of these image annotation tools.\nInstall\nFlameshot is directly available in 18.04 from the universe/graphics repository. Usage info in man page.\nAdditional installation options, such as how to compile with latest features or installation on older/other distros, are available on project page. Note: Latest version installed from source has cool features (not yet released); but will be included in version 0.6.\n\nA: I use 5CM Uploader.\nIt has built-in editor and can upload screenshots to the image hosting.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:luza-mbox/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install 5up\n\nClick on icon or press Ctrl+Print Screen for taking screenshot.\n\nA: I recommend using the command line tool scrot as it is easy to use and, unlike import, it supports transparency.\nTo install:\nsudo apt-get install scrot\n\nTo capture a screen area:\nscrot -s /tmp/foo.png\n\n\nA: Screencloud \nThere is a new kid on the block of screenshot utilities: screencloud\n\nIt's a pretty cool tool, available in the Ubuntu Software Center (at least on Ubuntu 12.04).\n\nIt has many nice features to easily share the screenshots via the Internet, hence its name.\n\n\n*\n\n*Upload the screenshot to screencloud. The link is automatically pasted to your clipboard;\n\n*You can use an FTP or SFTP own server for this kind of sharing\n\n*It's multi-platform.\n\n\nA: Update:\nAs of Jan 2022, I do see updates and fixes being released for Shutter so the below update I do not think is still apt. For e.g. they just pushed a release 0.99.2 on Oct 24, 2021.\nUpdate:\nAs of Aug 2018, Shutter project hasn't had a release or security fix since 2014. Many key libraries are depreciated, it may not exist beyond Ubuntu 18.04. Consider a newer maintained alternative, such as one of the projects listed below. Know of something new and missing?  Add it!\n\nI am using Shutter .\nIf you don't find it, you can check the detailed installation instructions which will give you a PPA for it.\nIt's a really handy screen capture application with easy to use plug-ins to give a nice touch to your screenshot and as many other to easily share the files.\nIt offers in-house image editing and special effects (via plug-ins) to enhance the quality of your screenshot. You can access this options via the menu (1), or the toolbar (2).\n\nThe effects here are all done with Shutter (Plug-in Reflexion and Edit auto-increment shape).\nAnd then to publish them, I just right click in Shutter and choose Export (3). Then I publish it via Ubuntu One. I go to the directory where I published the file, right click on it and select Copy Ubuntu One public URL.\nFinally here when I comment, I click on img in the small tool bar and select From the web and paste the link that was copied in the previous step.\nIt's easy and fully integrated.\nFor those on 10.04, check that you have all shutter dependencies. As you might miss some of the plug-ins. For user on Ubuntu 10.10, this should be fixed.\n\nA: Spectacle\nKDE Framework 5 default screenshot capture utility is the Spectacle.\n\nSpectacle is a simple application for capturing desktop\nscreenshots. It can capture images of the entire desktop, a single\nmonitor, the currently active window, the window currently under the\nmouse, or a rectangular region of the screen. The images can then be\nprinted, sent to other applications for manipulation, or quickly be\nsaved as-is\n\n\n\n\nSpectacle - Development Information: https://www.kde.org/applications/graphics/spectacle/development\n\nA: HotShots\nAnswer from SoftwareRecs. Note that, as of November 2016, HotShots hasn't been updated since 2014-Sep. The same can be said for Shutter, unfortunately.\n\nHotshots is a screenshot tool with some editing features. It is particularly suitable for writing documentation, but you can use it to highlight some details on a map image or what ever you want.\nFeatures\nSome important features:\n\n*\n\n*Free/libre software and gratis\n\n*Can take screenshots: all screens, full screen, window, region, free hand region\n\n*Can crop those screenshots or any image inside its editor\n\n*Can add texts (where you will be able to choose the color)\n\n*Can add arrows (where you will  be able to choose the color)\n\n*Can mark stuff with rectangles / ellipses/ polygons/ curves (where you will be able to choose the color)\n\n*Can use “system” shortcuts to take a screenshot.\n\nPlatform support\n\n*\n\n*Linux (needs compilation such as on Slackware Linux; Download) -- libXfixes and libqxt would be needed before compilation. Also, developer says that compiled packages are also available for Ubuntu and Arch Linux.\n\n*Windows XP/Vista/7/8\n\nUsage\nHotShots is pretty simple to use (similar to KolourPaint, MS Paint or GIMP, if you used any of them), and you may refer to its guide in case you need to know more.  As for the asked features, I have put them in an screenshot.\nIn the following screenshot, you would find:\n\n*\n\n*the interface of the HotShots\n\n*zoom in on \"Soft\"\n\n*custom text written below website's title\n\n*a red colored arrow pointing to Questions\n\n*a rectangle bordering first line of your question's body\n\n*an image of a turtle added where question's stats were visible\n\n*blurred the fourth requirement of your question's body\n\n*made a free curve to make up for free hand requirement accompanied by a text box below it\n\n*highlighted with yellow color a line of the body\n\n*enclosed \"Love this site?\" by an ellipse\n\n*encircled kittens roaming on my desktop\n\n\n\nA: CopyQ linux clipboard manager tool has as well a printscreen functionality configurable in shortcuts, its instant, it freezes a screen without leaving any menues hiding. And it works also on desktopless environments, screen managers like xmonad.\n", "Q: How can I get Unity to recognize installed applications it doesn't list? Firstly, I should say I am enjoying the new Unity interface.  It's not without it's peccadilloes, however.  My main concern, for the purposes of my question, is that there are a couple of applications that I have installed which do not appear in the Application list accessed on the Unity Launcher.  Is there a way to force Unity to acknowledge these skipped over programs?\nOne of the programs I am having trouble with is Ryzom, a online role playing game.  It's a game that doesn't require a traditional install like most programs.  You simply extract to a folder in your Home directory and run the client program.  Perhaps Unity doesn't recognize programs that aren't \"installed\".  Can I add Ryzom to the Applications list so I can start it without resorting to Terminal?  I've tried using the Main Menu function in System, but apparently that has no bearing on what applications show up in Unity.  That would explain why all the program I had hidden in Main Menu are showing up in Unity.\nThanks for any insight you can give.\n\nA: I think you need to create a .desktop file in your /usr/share/applications/ folder.

On my ASUS ul30vt with Maverick installed I have the problem that the webcam shows the picture flipped. What can I do to make it normal?\n\nA: According to this post on the Asus UL30 team's mailing list you can use this PPA to fix the webcam in 10.04. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be information on how well this works with 10.10.\nI recommended joining the team, posting on the mailing list since you'll find a bunch of UL30 owners there, and then updating your progress here so that we can point people to the right information. This information should at least get you pointed in the right direction.\n\nA: Step 1 would be to check for a firmware update for your hardware. I've seen this specific problem corrected in firmware, although not specifically your model. If that doesn't work, look into module \"quirks\" settings for your video device. \n", "Q: Can't empty Trash Folder in Evolution I upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10, started my Evolution, deleted some messages, and now I can not empty the Trash folder... Even Ctrl+E could not help. I always get an error message: something went wrong in my home's hidden (?) mail directory.\nIs this a 'normal feature' of the new default mail program of Ubuntu 10.10? I hope not!\n\nA: From you comment, the error message should read:\n\nError storing `~/.evolution/mail/local/myusername (mbox)': Summary and folder mismatch, even after a sync.\n\nProbably the summary file is corrupted. To fix this you'd need to delete it and let Evolution rebuild it.\nFirst make sure you backup your '~/.evolution' folder!\nNow delete the summary file:\nrm ~/.evolution/mail/local/myusername.ev-summary (adjust the filename)\nNow you need to restart evolution and evolution-data-server, and it should rebuild the summary file.\n\nA: Sounds like there might be a file permission problem.  This could have occurred during the upgrade.\nOpen up a terminal (make sure Evolution is closed first).  Type in:\nchown -R yourusername .evolution.  Depending on the size of the directory, it might take a moment. Once you are returned back to the main prompt.  Launch Evolution again to see if the same problem occurs.\nIf it does, please post exactly what it says.\n\nA: Had the same problem, but then tried to delete the trashed mail by not selecting the mails and use the DEL key but just used the empty trash option in the file pull-down menu.\nThis worked for me.\n", "Q: How to set clutter flow permanent for pictures folder on maverick I would like to make the clutter flow on the Maverick permanent for the ~/pictures folder.\nwhen I close nautilus clutter flow resets and I have to again press F4 and resize the area.

Is it worth using? Is there a way to install the new Ubuntu font to be used throughout Ubuntu? What is the difference with the 3 fonts: Ubuntu, Ubuntu Title, and Ubuntu beta?\n\nA: The Ubuntu Font Family's final name is \"Ubuntu\". (See this question) \n\n\n*\n\n*\"Ubuntu Beta\" is the name of  the font during testing, you can safely remove it.\n\n*\"Ubuntu Title\" is likely the font from the ttf-ubuntu-title package and is an older font in the style of the older deprecated Ubuntu logo.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Ubuntu Title (package ttf-ubuntu-title) was the logo typeface between 2004–2010.\n\n*Ubuntu (package ttf-ubuntu-font-family) is a typeface under development during 2010–2011 and beyond.  This forms the logotype used for ubuntu and CANONICAL from 2010 onwards (Ubuntu 10.04 and above)\n\n*UbuntuBeta (package ttf-ubuntu-font-family) is used to denote parts of the Ubuntu Font Family that are still in development and not quite ready.  This marks it clear to the user that these are works-in-progress and ensures that they have to be explicitly selected and chosen by the user.\nUnless you are involved with the early beta-testing and development process (which of course, you are most welcome to) then I would not recommend attempting to use any versions marked \"UbuntuBeta\".  The latest stable version of the Ubuntu Font Family (ttf-ubuntu-font-family) is already available in all supported versions of Ubuntu.  See:\n\n\n*\n\n*Question #5097 How do I use the new “Ubuntu Font Family” in older releases?\n\nA: Ubuntu Beta is Ubuntu (if you are now running 10.10).  Ubuntu Title is font that was used for the original Ubuntu logo.\nIf you are using 10.10 as a fresh install the default font is Ubuntu.  Else under Appearance Preferences > Fonts> you can set it there.\nYou may have to install the font sudo apt-get install ttf-ubuntu-font-family\nI personally enjoy the new font.\n\nA: If you're using Maverick, the Ubuntu font should be installed. To use it as a UI font (in case you've upgraded and it's not already set), go to System > Preferences > Appearance > Fonts, and set it as the font to be used for the items of your choice.\nUbuntuBeta was the name of the pre-release font that was initially made available to Ubuntu members for testing, and later to other interested groups. You should avoid using it at this point if it's somehow present together with the \"Ubuntu\" font on your system.\nUbuntu Title is the font used for the old Ubuntu logo.\n", "Q: What native games are available? \nThis question exists because it has historical significance, but it is not considered a good, on-topic question for this site, so please do not use it as evidence that you can ask similar questions here.

I get 15 FPS on my Pentium 3, which is perfectly fine, seeing as the game is turned-based. It's also in the software centre, but there's an offical PPA you should add, considering netplay only works with the latest version.\nBeware: the name will soon be changed to Warmux.\n\n\nA: FreeCiv   and FreeCol \nThose two games are inspired from Civilization and Colonization.

Video Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4DgDTRf_Sk\n\nA: Heroes of Newerth\nGenre: RTS\nInspired by DOTA (custom mod for warcraft3), where you pick one of the 70ish available heroes and team with 4 other people to compete against another team of 5. Gameplay is incredibly rich, it is a game that you can play for years without ever tiring of it because playing with and against other players makes the experience much more deep.\n\nHowever I must warn you that the learning curve is pretty steep, you will be called a noob, you will get yelled at, it will take you a couple of weeks to get used to all the heroes, their abilities and the various items available. However, the guys at S2 have added a new game mode, which is supposed to be much easier, with a smoother learning curve - casual mode. The game becomes overall more forgiving of mistakes, for example there is no more gold penalty on death.\nDefinitely one of my favorite games on PC\n\nA: Warsow \nGenre: FPS\nTake Quake 3 remove what is bad, improve what is good mix it with great graphics and you get Warsow. In Warsow it's a little easier to do strafe jumping and you can wall-jump and get speed easily so that make that you'll hardly find slow noobs but it is still hard to become good at this game and it'll need a lot of training.\nIn this game there is a lot of gamemode and one of this is race, that the same as the DeFRaG mod for Quake 3, if you don't know DeFRaG you probably don't know why so many people love Quake 3 and that's a shame, so I play this gamemode most of the time even if there is not a lot of server on this gamemode.

Players can choose from 2 unique races, aliens and humans. Players on both teams are able to build working structures in-game like an RTS. These structures provide many functions, the most important being spawning. The designated builders must ensure there are spawn structures or other players will not be able to rejoin the game after death. Other structures provide automated base defense (to some degree), healing functions and much more...\n\nPlayer advancement is different depending on which team you are on. As a human, players are rewarded with credits for each alien kill. These credits may be used to purchase new weapons and upgrades from the \"Armoury\". The alien team advances quite differently. Upon killing a human foe, the alien is able to evolve into a new class. The more kills gained the more powerful the classes available.\nThe overall objective behind Tremulous is to eliminate the opposing team. This is achieved by not only killing the opposing players but also removing their ability to respawn by destroying their spawn structures.\n\n\nA: Glest \nGenre: RTS\nA free 3D real-time strategy game, where you control the armies of two different factions: Tech, which is mainly composed of warriors and mechanical devices, and Magic, that prefers mages and summoned creatures in the battlefield.\nGlest is not just a game, but also an engine to make strategy games, based on XML and a set of tools.

At that point something changed in the configuration and I couldn't assign a key to the scroll wheel anymore (note: the pad's scroll wheel, not the mouse's), i.e this command:\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom Graphire4 6x8 pad\" AbsWDn \"key +\"\n\nreturns silently without error but nothing happens. Same goes for AbsWUp, RelWDn, RelWUp.\nApparently though the problem is even deeper as pressing the wheel in a xev window doesn't seem to have any effect.\nMoreover I am thoroughly confused on how the various pieces (kernel driver, xorg driver, evdev, HAL, xinput?) are supposed to work together and if the wacom module that ships with Ubuntu is the one from linuxwacom or not.\nAny ideas? I don't want to become an X.org hacker just to understand what's going on... it used to work!\nNOTE: I have already read question 3940, but that's not the same problem.\n\nA: I'm not sure if it's the same issue with the Graphire, but there's been a bug in recent Linuxwacom releases that prevented assigning keys to the wheel on the Intuos4. I'll edit this answer once I find a link to the relevant bug; you might have to wait for a fix to it.\nOn Ubuntu 10.04, I used Martin Owens' PPA for updated drivers, which made button assignment possible on the Intuos4, but didn't help with the wheel.\n", "Q: Is there a Visual Studio style tool/IDE? I have been developing in the windows space with Visual Studio for a while now with work, but I have also been using Ubuntu for a while and am keen to get into some software development for linux.\nI should also note. I am not looking for .NET and I am aware of mono. I am also familiar with c++ development and some python, so the language isn't so much relevant as the \"all in one\" aspect.\nI was interested to know if there is a useful all in one code/debug/design(gui) IDE similar to something like Visual Studio but for linux?\n\nA: Although other answers might suggest that MonoDevelop is only for C# development, it also handles C, C++, Python, Vala and Java.  And Visual Basic, if that's what you're after :).\n\nA: Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with support for Mac, Linux and Windows.\n\nA: Mono is a mature and successful open-source implementation of the .Net framework and many .Net languages (C#, for example). If you know Visual Basic or C#, then you can code on Ubuntu (works even on Windows and Mac OSX) using MonoDevelop  << (Click this icon to install MonoDevelop). Its a nice and highly-featured IDE, and creates applications that look and feel native on Ubuntu (thanks to the use of GTK).\n\nA: You may also consider Lazarus which basically mimics Delphi type of application Development.\n\nA: In your comment you said you were more concerned about the \"all in one\" aspect, however if you want the best possible experience I think it's important to choose the right tool. \nC++/Qt:\nQt Creator: A cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) tailored to the needs of Qt developers. (I would recommend this option if you plan to be programming in C++).\n\n\nJava:\nEclipse: This is pretty much the de facto Java IDE. \n\n\nC#/.NET:\nMono: MonoDevelop is an IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.\n\n\nMy personal \"IDE\" is Gedit. It is minimal (similar to Notepad++ on Windows), but it gets the job done. It also supports plugins which can basically make it a true IDE. It supports most languages including C/C++, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, HTML, etc.\n \n\nIf you're using KDE as your desktop enviroment and don't want to run Gedit, you could also try Kate.\n\n\nA: I haven't used it, but I've heard about Code::Blocks, which is also quite good. From forums I just read, it seems Code::Blocks might be just a little unstable. You might want to look at this thread at cplusplus.com. Just googling \"kdevelop vs codeblocks\" gives a bunch of results that compares the two as well as some others like Anjuta, Eclipse and NetBeans.\n\nA: I use codelite, which is a rapidly growing IDE for C/C++. It is my favorite of the lot so far, eclipse being too restrictive, code::lite being bloated (in my opinion). \nEDIT: I'd just like to add that it is clearly inspired by Visual Studio, so users of the VS tools should feel at home.\n\nA: Intellij IDEA community edition is also quite decent tool.\n\nA: I don't have much experience with it myself (I personally like to work in gedit), but for the sake of completeness we really should mention Anjuta . It is part of the GNOME project, and includes many of the features you are interested in.\n\n\n*\n\n*Focus on C/C++, but extensible with plugins. Some support for Python and Vala.\n\n*Integrated Glade user interface designer.\n\n*Version control integration with at least Git, CVS, and Subversion.\n\n*Project management and autotools support.\n\n*Integrated debugger including breakpoints, ect... Backed by gdb.\n\n*GTK+/GNOME Devhelp API help browser integration.\n\n*Valgrind plugin to profile programs for memory leaks.\n\n\n\nA: MonoDevelop  is probably the closest match but you Mono isn't a \"typical Linux\" setting. Eclipse does provides something similar with Java (instead of .NET or Mono).\nFor something more traditional or purer, you might want to learn more about Perl or Python. Python is pretty simple but the closest you'll get to an IDE is the PyDev plugin for Eclipse.\nThe Linux build process is much more scripted and relies, on the whole, a lot less on IDEs.\n\nA: I can't believe everyone's saying \"use KDevelop\" for C++.\nIn my experience, there is no better tool than Qt Creator.\nIt is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fast\n\n*Has a very flexible project manager\n\n*Can be used for any C++ project - even non-Qt ones\n\n*Has what I consider to be the best code-completion engine ever\n\n*Integrates very extensively with the Qt framework (which I really recommend)\n\n\n\n\nA: It depends on the programming language:\nJava, PHP, C/C++, ... : Eclipse, NetBeans\nC#: MonoDevelop\n\nA: As mentioned in other answers, you can use Mono. But making cross platform applications using Mono requires attention, as you have to filter Windows specific libraries. So, before importing your project to Mono, check out the compatibility of the libraries you use. \n\nA: I use eclipse a lot.  It was primarily developed for Java development but has a bunch of plugins that extend it to work with other languages.\n\nA: You need to state what programming language you are interested in using because it makes a huge difference to the answer.\nFor c# development in linux use MonoDevelop\nFor Java development use eclipse\nFor c/c++ development use KDevelop\n\nA: Depending on what languages you are looking to delve into there are a few options.\nBASIC:  Gambas\nMono/C#:  MonoDevelop\nC/C++: KDevelop (sans GUI designing)\n\nA: For Python development you can also use pIDA which embeds vim or emacs in a Python IDE.\nsudo apt-get install pida\n\nOr WingIDE, which is a commercial, closed source IDE with a limited version available for free (and the full version available for download to try it out for a couple of weeks).\nFor debugging compiled languages, you can also use the Nemiver debugging GUI if the editor/IDE you use doesn't have good enough debugging support\nsudo apt-get install nemiver\n\n\nA: Also look at kBasic\n", "Q: Do you have to deactivate or deinstall gnome-screenshot when using shutter? In relation to this question: What screenshot tools are available? \nIs it advisable to deinstall or deactivate gnome-screenshot when installing and using shutter? Or doesn't it make any difference (e.g. is there two daemons running now?)? \nActivating shutter works perfectly, I'm just wondering whether the system gets bloated when installing a second tool to override the first one. \n\nA: These tools aren't actually daemons running - but rather only run when executed or launched. It would be similar to having both OpenOffice and gEdit installed on a computer. Though they both serve the same function they won't collide with eachother.\nYou should be fine and safe to have both tools installed side-by-side\n\nA: No not at all (unless your system has very little memory). Like Marco said in his answer these are two different programs. \nIt's just like having Firefox and Google Chrome running at the same time. However if you don't think your ever going to use one of the programs again, I would uninstall it. No point in wasting space.\n", "Q: How do I specify mounted windows shares as a command line path?

I own a Wacom Bamboo Fun CTH-661 and would like to know how I make it work on Ubuntu 10.10. I am a Linux newbie trying to migrate from Windows, so it would be wonderful to have a step-by-step answer.\nMany thanks!\n\nA: Unfortunately, the wacom configuration is not one of the things that has made it to \"automatic plug and play\" level yet with Ubuntu, but I'm very happy that we have working drivers at all.\nMost wacoms will work out of the box with ubuntu 9.10+.  This means pointer and pressure-sensitivity, and default configuration for the buttons. \nAs Ryan said above, xserver-xorg-input-wacom is the wacom driver that comes installed by default in Ubuntu 10+. However, this will not necessarily mean all your buttons are working how you want them to be. To get everything else working, there is a little bit of configuration involved, and you may have to do some googling to figure out how to get your particular model working.\nThis is something that can be *(Hopefully!) solved with the Linux-wacom-project's wacom-tools package; this is an extra utility that allows creates specific settings for your wacom tablet.\nI was using this up until ubuntu Karmic, but I have not determined wether this is yet working on ubuntu Maverick.

How can I can clone or ghost my Ubuntu System drive to restore it to a bigger HD?\nSomething like Norton Ghost does with NTFS or FAT on Windows.\n\nA: Clonezilla is the closest free option to Ghost.\nThe underlying tools it uses, partimage and ntfsclone, understand the underlying filesystem.  So unlike a simple low-level copy (dd) which copies all bytes, they only copy the used space on the filesystem and its metadata.  This results in a much smaller disk image.\n\nA: If you want to move your data to a new harddrive, the Simple Backup Suite can make it very easy for you. Just backup your data, then install Ubuntu onto the new hard-drive and restore from your backup.\nIf what you really want is a perfect transfer of data from your old harddrive to your new one, you can use the \"dd\" command-line tool to easily transfer the data. There's a great discussion of this technique on Server Fault.\n\nA: I was half way through a response when I found this page mirror.\nThe classical unix way is a tool called \"dd\". The page explains how to use it.\n", "Q: Letting modifier keys act as toggles under X Is there any way to let the Shift, Ctrl and Alt keys behave as toggles under X?\nI know how one could do it under CLI (for example, by doing this) but found\nno reference for doing so under X.\nPlease note that this is not a question on sticky keys, which can be enabled\nby an accessibility option.\n\nA: This is implemented on the DE level AFAIK.

I use this method on one of my lucid machines, and it works just fine.\n\nA: Here's an option you might find will fit your requirements. \nEnable the auto-login option for your user, but add a screen lock command to the list of startup applications. In case of Gnome following should work\ngnome-screensaver-command -l\n\nThis also has a benefit of loading your session \"in advance\".

If so, that seems to be a bug in the shutdown ordering in 10.10; the network interface must still be up in order to unmount NFS.\nI don't use 10.10 yet, so I can't confirm whether that's the case. But as a stopgap, you might try doing a soft mount instead of a hard one. Soft mounts allow the NFS requests to time out. But you'd better be sure to sync very fully before you shut down!\n\nA: heh. self-promotion disclaimer, but i actually recently wrote a bash script i think can help you with this scenario. the bash script goes in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ and solves a couple of quirks i found with NFS, particularly around the boot-up/shut-down issues.\nhttp://www.badgerbait.net/offtopic/network-specific-event-triggered-bash-script\nthe script mounts/unmounts the network share (really it'll do whatever you want to do at network connect/disconnect), but it's network specific (this way there's no attempt to mount/unmount if the resource isn't available) .you'll need to query arp tables for your routers mac, or just look at the routers stickers.\nthe other tip for using this if you decide to implement it, is to make sure that you add noauto to your fstab, so that it's not automatically mounted during bootup/shutdown...\nadding the noauto to fstab and then just manually mounting/unmounting the drive as needed is another potential quick-fix for this\nfyi: i am dogfooding, and have had zero issues w/ this approach. if you decide to adopt and encounter issues, please let me know.\n\nA: I had the same problem with nfs mounted drives preventing me from shutting down.

I had been updating it regularly.\nSine the day of up-gradation the audio and video playback is choppy regardless of any format. I waited until 10th of October.\nThis was not an issue in Lucid. How to resolve this problem.\n\nA: This really could be any number of problems. It also depends what Video/Audio playback your talking about (Flash, MP4, MP3, etc). Also what kind of Graphics card do you have (or do you even have one, most laptops use integrated graphics). If you could provide more information (like computer model, graphics card, etc) we might be able to help more, but for now I'll give you my best guess. \nFlash:\nForget about Flash, it sucks! Flash can be a resource hog, however if you want to browse the web it's kind of important to have. What browser are you using? This can make a huge difference as Firefox can have multiple addons that provide Flash support. You can use Adobe's proprietary implementation, or you can use a non-proprietary implementation. I've always had better success with Adobe's versions (but that's just me). \nGoogle Chrome on the other hand comes with Flash support. (Note: Chromium which is the open-source implementation of Chrome does not come with Flash as far as I know). I currently run Chrome on Ubuntu 10.10 and the Flash works amazingly well (and I have a integrated graphics). So far Chrome or Flash has not crashed once.\nMP3/MP4/Video/Audio Playback: To ensure you get the best possible playback I would recommend making sure you have FFmpeg. It supports just about every format you'll use (QuickTime, MP4, Real Player, Windows Media Player related codecs, etc). \nOnce you have this installed these programs/drivers the only thing that will cause choppy playback is your graphics card, or having other programs running that are using your graphics card (Compiz for example). \nIf you do have an integrated graphics card, increasing the amount of RAM in your system can help. Increasing RAM is also one of the cheapest upgrades you can do. If you have a Desktop, you most likely have a Graphics Card, in which case you can get a new one that will support better video playback.\n\nA: Try the solution mentioned here\nChoppy video in Maverick\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1592120&page=5\n\nA: I was going to simply upvote this, but I did not have the karma =(\nJust to set the record straight, the original solution was posted by NightwishFan on the ubuntu forums - thank you NightwishFan\nPost #2 here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1588889\n\nWorkaround for glitchy (crackling, skipping) audio is to open:\n  /etc/pulse/default.pa\nFind the line that looks like this and add tsched=0.\nload-module module-udev-detect\n\nIt should look like this:\nload-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\n\nNote:  This fixed an issue I had with a soundblaster PCI-e SB1040 card in Ubuntu 11.10 with choppy audio on AMD.

I'm a bit confused about doing backups with rsync/rdiff-backup / rsnapshot via SSH.\nI've been looking at utilities such as backupninja and rsnapshot.  These are rsync / rdiff based backup systems, capable of being scheduled to do backups over SSH.

Question says it all: \nWhat happens if rsnapshot or rdiff-backup gets interrupted in the middle of a transfer? \nI know that rsnapshot tries to make a complete snapshot of your system in rotating fashion, and rdiff-backup makes a differential backup, which is going to be based on the files previously saved behind it.\nSo: What happens if it gets interrupted in the middle?\nDoes this result in an \"incomplete snapshot\"? \nWill other snapshots which are dependent on this one be corrupted?

It will delete the incomplete increment so that the backup location is the same as if the interrupted backup attempt had never been started.\nrsnapshot is a little more complicated because its routine is more stepwise and varies depending on the use of the sync_first and use_lazy_deletes options.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use sync_first and rsnapshot sync gets interrupted, you can simply run rsnapshot sync again to straighten things out. If you accidentally run rsnapshot <backup level> at this point instead, the latest backup point will remain incomplete and will be carried through rotations.\n\n*If you don't use sync_first, you're just stuck with an incomplete backup point that is a hybrid of old and new version of files. Unless you manually reverse-rotate each backup point, the incomplete backup point will be carried through rotations.\n\n*In both cases, running rsnapshot <backup level> will cause the oldest backup point to be lost unless use_lazy_deletes is enabled.\n\n\nNote that sync_first and use_lazy_deletes come at the cost of using more disk space.\n\nA reminder/disclaimer: This should go without saying, but never just blindly trust others' advice on the internet.

Using the DNS name does not work. Why is that? What can I do to resolve (ha ha) this issue.\n\nA: You said you could get this to work by fully qualifying the DNS names. What this means is that at work you have a search workdomain.com line in your /etc/resolv.conf so that the local resolver will try appending that domain to any unqualified names its asked to resolve.  You can get the same effect by manually putting that line into your home  /etc/resolv.conf, but be aware that if you're using dhcp it might be overwritten the next time you acquire a new IP address.\n\nA: I figured this out.

Why does Ubuntu not allow the GUI users to login as root at the time of system start up like administrator in Windows?\nWhy they are restricting us to login only through the terminal?\n\nA: The reasoning behind the use of sudo in Ubuntu can be found here. If you ever need a quick way to \"go root\" I use sudo -s or sudo -i. \n\nA: Aside from the mountains of warnings with using root, you can enable root login by logging in and performing the following from terminal:\nsudo passwd\n\nThis will first prompt you for your password then will ask you to change UNIX password. The password you enter will be for the root account. \nThe Ubuntu Wiki has a great article on the depths of root and sudo within Ubuntu - caveats and pitfalls.\n\nA: There are two questions here. One is, why is root login disabled by default in Ubuntu? That's been addressed by several of the posts here.\nThe second question is, why are graphical root logins particularly disparaged?\nAll the disadvantages of nongraphical root logins apply to graphical root logins too. But when you log in graphically, you run far more programs, operating in a far more complex way, than when you log in nongraphically. The entire graphical user interface and all the graphical programs needed to use a GUI effectively, would be running as root. A tiny security vulnerability in any of them would enable someone to take complete control over your system.\nLogging in as root at all is not recommended in Ubuntu, but there is no consensus in the security community that it is universally a bad practice. Graphical root logins, however, are simply a bad practice, and almost all operating systems have phased them out or strongly recommend against them.\nTo a lesser degree, having a non-root user (especially one with the ability to perform operations as root with sudo or PolicyKit) in a graphical login presents risks. But they are far more controlled than when everything in the graphical environment must actually be running as root with unlimited capabilities. Still, for situations where security is paramount, it is usually advisable to do away with graphical interfaces altogether, which is why Ubuntu Server doesn't ship with a GUI by default and officially recommends against installing one (though it is supported to do so).\nIn the Windows world, you can now install Windows Server in a way that essentially eliminates the graphical user interface (technically, some elements remain, but it is very stripped down and you cannot run arbitrary graphical programs). This is based on the same reasoning.\nEven if you do decide to enable root logins, please don't log in graphically as root. Enabling root logins may put you at slightly higher security risk; running an entire graphical environment as root puts you at enormously higher risk.\nAdditionally, with the exception of graphical administration tools that are designed to be run as root with gksu/gksudo/kdesudo, most graphical programs are not intended to be run as root. Because they are not extensively tested in this mode, they may fail or behave erratically (which would be particularly bad, since they're running as root).\nFinally, even some graphical administration tools, like users-admin, will fail if run as root, since they expect to be run by normal users and to perform actions as root (without ever actually running as root) using PolicyKit.\n\nA: Because it is not recommended doing so unless you know exactly what you are doing. Root is a superuser, meaning it can do anything and everything - it is only meant for administrative tasks. Day-for-day tasks can bear a security risk that WILL be exploited if EVERYONE (or a large proportion of users) used root. Think Windows - 99% of malware and virus problems are from people using admin accounts for everyday tasks.\nLet's look at an example:\nWhat if someone breaks into your system and tells it to erase your disks? If you are running as a normal user, the only files you would (should) be able to remove are those that belong to you, and not anyone else. If, say, you had other people using the computer, their files will not be touched at all, no matter how hard you try. That means you will not be able to change any system files, and therefore your system will remain rock-solid and unaffected/uninfected.\nIf you run as root, however, you can wipe the hard drive entirely, probably do some damage to the hardware itself, and generally render the system unusable. Correction: anyone who can get to run a single command as root on your computer (some malicious website or an email attachment) can do that.\nTake a look this nice article that might explain it better than I did.\nHere's another one.\nYou can always use sudo command or gksu command to run the command as the superuser, both of those work with graphical and command-line utilities. sudo is usually used for CLI, though, and gksu is the graphical password promt that does the same thing.\nTo an extent, they let you become root temporarily - much, much better than running as root constantly and risking instability.\n\nA: Open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T or Dash home > More Apps > Installed (Expand) > Terminal).\nTO ACTIVATE THE ROOT ACCOUNT\nIn a terminal type or paste sudo passwd root.\nEnter your normal login password (if you are asked for it), then you will be asked to enter the new root password and confirm it.\nTO ADD A NEW LOGIN PROMPT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ENTER ROOT AND ITS PASSWORD\nIn a terminal type or paste. gksudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf. This opens a graphical text editor window where you can edit the configuration file for the login screen.\nAdd the line greeter-show-manual-login=true to the bottom of the file.\nThe file should now read as follows:\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=ubuntu\ngreeter-show-manual-login=true\n\nSave the lightdm.conf file and exit from gedit.\nReboot Ubuntu 12.04 and you will see a new “Login” window (replaces the previous \"Other\" window) which allows for Username and Password input . Enter root for the username and then enter the password you assigned to the root account.\nI hope this helps others that need/want root access.\n\nA: as for ubuntu 12.04 LTS you can do this using root privilege:\necho \"greeter-hide-users=true\" >> /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nThen you are asked to type both the username and password to login graphically. I'm assume you have already set the password for root:)\nI know there are countless reason that you shouldn't login directly as root, however, there  does exit some rare cases (for example in a test box running in vmware) when you really appreciated the convience of being root.\n\nA: In standard Ubuntu, root logins are not allowed, neither from the GDM (graphical) login manager, nor from the text console (i.e., the one you get if press Ctrl+Alt+F1).\nIn order to perform root (i.e., administrator) operations you have to use the sudo command in a terminal, or any GUI equivalent of it: these will ask you for your password and then perform the requested privileged operation (and only that one).  \nThe reason for this behavior is, as others have pointed out, that performing root operations is inherently risky and the number of operations really requiring root privileges is comparatively small: by using this sudo approach you are running most of the time with a unprivileged account (i.e., harmless to the system and other users) and just get the root powers when it's really needed.\nAn example might help clarify.  Assume you want to install a new service (daemon) on your machine; this is relatively new and you need to read about it and how to configure it to your needs.  You will end up browsing the web a lot to find information, example configs, etc., maybe have some IRC chat to ask for more info -- none of this requires root powers! In the end, you only need privileged access for two operations:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the new program (i.e., sudo apt-get install ...), and \n\n*edit the default configuration\n\n\nA commonly accepted principle in computer security is always use the least possible privilege level to perform an operation. -- this reduces the risk that something bad happens because of bugs in the software or errors from the operator. \nThe Ubuntu default setup goes in this direction; if you were using a root login, instead, you would have ended up surfing the internet, doing IRC (and possibly all the other stuff that one does concurrently) from the root account, thus needlessly exposing the system to a threat.\nUpdate: For your compiler example, I would proceed this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to the node via SSH as your regular user, and from another\nUbuntu or GNU/Linux node where you have a graphical X11 display\nrunning.  Be sure to enabled X11 forwarding over SSH:\nssh -X myuser@remotemachine.example.org\n\n\n*At the shell/SSH prompt, issue the command:\nsudo /path/to/the/compiler/install/program\n\nThis will run the compiler installer with root privileges, \nand access (through SSH forwarding) the graphical display in front\nof you.\n\nA: Because the root user and Administrator (in Windows) are the equivalent of a God to a computer.  That user can adjust anything from file permissions to even erasing the entire file system.  It is quite common for the average home user to run as the Administrator (either under that name or another name set up at first boot).  Because any program executed as that user is system wide, it becomes dangerous.\nThe lack of control over Administrative privileges allows for virus/malware or even self-destructive issues.  It is because of this that many distros, including Ubuntu, limited the transition to the high power by an extra step (a somewhat cognitive step that helps to insist that \"any changes I make here are changes that are grander in scope\").  \n\nA: Although you can't login directly as root (for the reasons that others have already explained well), you can run GUI applications as root. For example, System → Administration → Synaptic Package Manager is a graphical application that runs as root.\nTo run an application as root (either a text application or a GUI application), just use one of this commands:\nsudo name-of-the-application\ngksu name-of-the-application\n\nThey're almost identical. The main difference is that the first asks for your password on the terminal, the second uses a graphical dialog window.\n\nA: Root really isn't advised for normal usage but sometimes you have a long list of terminal commands that need root privileges and it's just more convenient to login as root.\n  I use sudo xterm or gksu xterm to open a root terminal\n  I think its a little easier to distinguish which term window has root privileges wheen you have the handy \"root@\" term prompt\n\nA: Additional note : Ubuntu is not allowing the GUI users to login as root because Ubuntu prevent you to accidentally remove or delete important files with GUI apps (like nautilus).\nWith only CLI user interface, it can be reduce the risk of our mistake.\nBut formerly we can't log in with root even in CLI mode because Ubuntu create a random password for root. Root administrative task can only be done by using the user's password with command sudo or gksu.\nIt's based on Debian rule.\n\nA: Given that there are no good reasons to login as root, I would guess the difference between RH (allow root login) and ubuntu (do everything using sudo/gksu) is a matter of preference.\nAs for the other part of your question you should be able to run your graphical installation by logging in as a regular user, pressing ALT-F2 and entering gksu. In the resulting dialog just enter the command that launches your installer.\n\nA: Root is not recommended for day to day daily task. As it provides u superuser previledges it can be misused.thus there is no option for root on login. \n\nA: You should always log on as yourself and then sudo to perform actions as root.  Ubuntu is set up to allow you most all access needed by default.  Minor changes will take care of the rest (like adding your used to other groups).  It is considered poor practice to log in as root.  The industry best practice is the default set up here.  \nSomeone able to log in as root can be a very bad thing from a security perspective.\n", "Q: How do I banish the \"You have just inserted an Audio CD.\" dialog forever? Sometimes when I insert an audio CD I get a dialog that says \"You have just inserted an Audio CD. Choose what application to launch.\" It doesn't show up for every CD... probably something like once for every 5 CD insertions.\nEvery single time I select \"Do Nothing\" and ensure that the \"Always perform this action\" checkbox is checked. I assume the point of the checkbox is to let me make the decision once and for all, but this dialog continues to reappear periodically.\n\nA: Prompting for action to perform upon inserting media is a behaviour of nautilus (the file browser program in GNOME Environment). To change this behaviour I would recommend the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close all open File Browser windows\n\n*Open Places -> Home Folder. This will open the home folder in a new File Browser window.\n\n*Click Edit -> Preferences\n\n*Select the Media tab\n\n*For those media types where you don't want any prompt, select Do Nothing in the drop-down list.\n\n*Click Close\nFrom next time, you should not get the messages while inserting media.\n\nA: In 12.04 this functionality is no longer in Nautilus and has been moved to the System Settings application.\nUnity Dash -> System Settings -> System -> Details -> Removable Media\nThere is a checkbox there that says \"Never prompt or start programs on media insertion\"\nI haven't tested if it actually works though ;-)\n", "Q: Is there any PPA for ralink 3090 64bit?

Is it possible to set up package selection within the preseed file (what groups of packages to install etc.)? If so, how can this be done?\n\nA: At a high level, the key part of creating is a preseed file that can specify options that the installer asks you. An example preseed file can be found at the debian website. The example provides most of the options that you may want to modify.\nWhen it gets down to implementation, there are a few more steps to be followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain the image. You can choose between a full image and a mini iso which downloads a fresh copy of packages off the internet. The process is slightly different, but mostly analogous.\n\n*Once you have the image, you need to extract files from the iso. There might be a one-step way to do this, but this is how I've always done it like this:\nsudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 mini.iso /mnt\ncp -rf /mnt /path/to/extractdir\nsudo umount /mnt\n\n\n*Now you create the preseed file that you want to use. In the mini iso, since you don't really have a hierarchy, just put it in the root folder. In the regular server install, put it in the preseed folder. It is your choice where you want to put it/what you want to call it.\n\n*Once you have the preseed, you need to specify it to the kernel. In the mini iso, you need to edit text.cfg, or in the full install, isolinux/text.cfg to include your preseed by editing the APPEND line as follows:\nAPPEND arg1 arg2=value2 arg3 ... file=/cdrom/path/to/preseed/file locale=en_US console-setup/ask_detect=false console-setup/layout=us --\n\nDon't remove existing values unless you know what you're doing\n\n\n*\n\n*Once you're done modifying the preseed and text.cfg files, you need to repack things as an ISO. To do this, you need to put isolinux on the CD to make it bootable. Now, cd to the root directory of the extracted image, and do the following [taken from the syslinux website:\ncd /path/to/extractdir\nmkisofs -o output.iso -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -R -J -T .\n\nYou need to add the -l (or -iso-level 2)flag to support longer file names.\nYour iso is at output.iso and ready to be burned!\n\nA: Ok, I spent WAY too much time figuring out how to get this to work. Shroff, your example, though close, isn't quite there.\nAt least the last part of it.\nThe last step, with the mkdir CD_root, and mkisofs is slightly off.\nIf you did the\nsudo mount -o loop mini.iso /mnt\ncp  -fr /mnt/ ./new_image\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nThe next steps get fuzzy in your example.  The editing the text.cfg, and placement of pressed.txt (name I used) is right.  So the following:\ncd new_image\nchmod 777 .\nvim pressed.txt\nvim text.cfg\n\nNext step:\ncd ..\nmkisofs -o output.iso -b isolinux.bin -l -c boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table new_image\n\nI was lost when dealing with the isolinux/isoliunux.bin, and the CD_root.

To do that, use mount -t vboxsf SHARENAME /path/to/where/to/mount.\nSHARENAME depends on your shared folder, it is the name you entered into VirtualBox Shared Folders dialog.\n/path/to/where/to/mount should ideally be inside your user directory (inside VBox).

Is it possible to restore files/directories which are deleted from terminal using rm and rm -r?. If a file is deleted from graphical interface, it could be restored from trash, but how do you restore a file if it is removed using the rm utility?.\n\nA: To this end I use trash-cli package and the following alias in my ~/.bashrc\nalias rm=trash\n\nAnd the trash-cli package can be installed by the followoing command: sudo apt-get install trash-cli.\nThe files you remove will be moved to trash, and you can see them in nautilus trashcan.\nYou can always access the real rm by using one of the following method:\ncommand rm something\n'rm' something\n\\rm something\n\nThere are also commands to access the trashcan from terminal, trash-list, restore-trash (or trash-restore), trash-empty installable from package trash-cli (then see their man pages).\nLast note, it is not advisable to use such an alias for super-user, because it can interfere with system operations.\n\nA: Just as an alternative, if you know specifically what type of file it is...\nsudo apt-get install foremost\n\nNow open up /etc/foremost.conf and you will see a long list of commented out lines. If your file type exists, uncomment the line (you may also want to remove the irrelevant lines). \nIf your file type does not exist, add your own line. Say I want to recover a .css file and I know its around 40K. I could do add this:\ncss     n       40000   Theme\\sName:     Plugin\\sFixes\n\nThe 2nd column refers to case-sensitivity, the third column refers to the upper limit for size, the 4th column is how the file starts (remember to use escaped characters) and the last column is how the file usually ends.\nUse the following command (edit the disk accordingly. could check with df command)\nforemost -v -T -c /etc/foremost.conf -i /dev/sda -o output\n\nWhat will happen next is that foremost will create a folder called output and dump all the recovered data (in this case) into the folder. From there you could use diff or meld to compare the recovered 'files' and see which is the most up to date.\n\nA: Speaking in the most abstract terms, whenever you delete a file on the graphical interface, the file is \"moved\" to a special \"buffer\", a directory called trash. You can locate it in your home directory, ~/.local/share/Trash/. Files \"deleted\" from this directory, will be really deleted. This real deletion is what happens when you use rm on a file. \nIt's extremely hard to recover deleted files. Files in the file system are represented as nodes on a B-tree or the like. When a file is deleted using rm, the tree is updated, number of hardlinks are reduced, the corresponding entry in the directory listing is removed. If at all, your file had a hard link, your file is absolutely safe. You can do a file / -samefile filename. You can search the file if you remember its inode number too (this is hardly the case). \nAnother case is when none of the above possibilities is true. Whenever you rm a file, the file entry on the directory is removed, reducing the number of hardlinks by one. And if the number of hard links drops to zero, then the pointer to the file on the inode is dropped, or is marked to be deleted. Either way, your file \"still\" resides on the hard disk. The file is actually erased from hard disk only on subsequent remount. File recovery at such a time is extremely hard, involves going through the file system tree and the inodes representing actual disk block locations. There's a popular tool I've heard of, but never used it, called extundelete. Although there's no guarantee, its  worth giving a try. \nOnce you recover your files successfully or not, make haste to do regular backups. It's extremely simple on Ubuntu.   \n\nA: Deleting it from terminal deletes it permanently - recovery is very hard and sometimes impossible.\nIf your partition type is ext3 (check it by using the System->Administration->Disk Utility), then take a look at ext3undel.\nIf it is not (if you installed Ubuntu with default settings), try the extundelete program.\nThere is no guarantee you will recover anything though.\n\nA: You are looking for: extundelete - utility to recover deleted files from ext3/ext4 partition\nTo find such a package, you can try: apt-cache search undelete\nTo use the utility install it with: sudo apt-get install extundelete\nAfter installation invoke man extundelete and study it carefully.\n\nA: Sorry, but files deleted from a command-line with the \"rm\" and \"rm -f\" bypass the \"Trashcan\" you have on the Gnome desktop.\nYou may also want to ask if there are any extfs \"undelete\" tools like there are for FAT and NTFS.  (I don't know of any, but I'd be surprised if there were none.)\n\nA: \nuse \"rm-trash\" utility which handles puts them to trash for later retrieval and supports all options of \"rm\" command.\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nateshmbhat/rm-trash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rm-trash\n\n\"rm-trash\" is \n\n\n*\n\n*meant to be used in place of rm\n\n*handles all options that rm can take\n\n*handles the file name collisions with the files already in trash\n\n*handles some permission issues automatically\n\n*if rm is called from any other script or indirectly then the system 'rm' command is used automatically\n\n*shows the appropriate error messages like those which arise in rm\n\nA: just add an alias in your file in home folde .bash_alias or .bash_profile\nalias rm='gio trash'\n\n", "Q: How safe are my files in /home? This is a community wiki. I would really like other folk's thoughts on this. I do not want to discuss the ethics of storing plain text passwords either.\nFor those unfamiliar, libpurple is the library used by Pidgin, and when you choose to save your passwords, it does so as plain text under ~/.purple/accounts.xml. \nThe reasoning behind this is that if someone can access your user account, you have bigger problems to worry about, among other valid points.\nMy main worry is that I use my gmail account in Pidgin, and so my gmail password is stored in plain text. Access to someone's email means access to 90% of their other accounts, via password recovery features on most sites. Eeek.\nConsider that...\n\n\n*\n\n*My /home is encrypted, if someone gets physical access to the drive\n\n*I always lock my system when I walk away\n\n*I'm sensible about installing unofficial packages\n\n*Any application I run in userland has access to my user files\n\n\nHow safe is this really? Are there any other threats that could potentially access accounts.xml?\n\nUpdate\nThanks for the replies! So far have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manage your firewall\n\n*Use applications that store sensitive info securely (ie via Gnome Keyring)\n\n*Use strong passwords and keep your system updated\n\n*Symlink sensitive files from an encrypted ~/Private directory\nI'm happy that my data is safe in case of theft. I'm more worried about some process crafted to target these unsecured files. Then again the nature of open source software makes it difficult for malicious apps, as public code review will expose the malicious code.\nIf you you can think of any other vectors through which these account details could be accessed, I'd like to hear them :)\n\nA: For the most part if anyone has physical access to the machine security is null and void. As for \"other users\" if they are not trying to access the files and might just stumble into it just set the permissions on your home folder so no one else has any access except you.\nAs far as security over a network I find it hard to believe someone would get into your personal files unless you carelessly leave ports open. If you are concerned use Gufw to manage your firewall. You can also check from this website if you have security holes of some kind: https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2\nAlso you can read this security overview on the Ubuntu forums: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=510812\nI hope this can be of help to you!\n\nA: So your concern is application that store sensitive data in clear text. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*alternatives: try to find another application that does not store your data in clear text. Empathy can be substitute for Pidgin and store your credentials inside Gnome Keyring, which is a safe store and encrypted,\n\n*strong password: You can't do much against physical access if the attacker thinks it can find higher values than what will cost him in time and resources cracking by brute force your encrypted hard disk. The stronger your password, the higher the chance the attacker will give up. Check Mozilla article + video about how to make strong password. And for your worry about your Gmail account, you can find Google solution to keep your account access secure.\n\n*keeping up-to-date: there is always the risk of a security hole in one of your application that could give an attacker access to your disk. E.g. a hole in Flash that leave disk access open could give an attacker free access to plain text files.\n\n\nA: I generally create an encrypted Private directory and move pidgin config and any other more dangerous information (.ssh, etc) into ~/Private. I then create symlinks for the directories in their original locations. To create an encrypted Private directory, use \necryptfs-setup-private\n\nYou may need to install a package as well: \nsudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils \n\nSee the this for more details \n\nA: If your /home is encrypted, then the only way that the password can be recovered is by unencrypting it, which the only way to do this (unless you have a very large server farm and a lot of time) is to use the password. This could be bruteforced in time, so make sure it is a very strong password.\nSo, all in all, that is pretty secure. I personally would be happy to keep my gmail password in an encrypted /home directory.\n", "Q: What is the difference between OpenOffice and the newly created LibreOffice? What is the difference between OpenOffice and LibreOffice? I understand that LibreOffice is another fork that is going to be developed. I have used OpenOffice since v1 and am wondering if there is a definite advantage to uninstalling and trying LibreOffice.\n\nA: Oracle bought Sun in 2010 and commercial development of OpenOffice.org was officially terminated shortly thereafter. Then some dedicated members of the OpenOffice.org community pooled their resources and set up The Document Foundation to provide structure and leadership for the continued development of the open source code used by OpenOffice.org. The new product was named Libre Office. Most of the original OpenOffice.org community support is now behind Libre Office.\nOpenOffice.org is now part of the Apache incubator project, but it still does have some licensing issues with Oracle.\nRead \"LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org: One Year After the Schism\" to understand more.\nI would personally say you should stick with using Libre Office now.\n\nA: Libre Office will include the changes from Go-oo, which is the version included in Ubuntu, so I would say that Libre Office from the beginning will be more similar to Go-oo.\nYou can read more about the difference between OOO and Go-oo here:\nhttp://go-oo.org/\n\nA: As of now there is hardly any changes between LibreOffice and OpenOffice. The former is a fork to free OpenOffice.org from the clutches of Oracle.\nTill date Sun has asked for copyright assignment to Sun if you wanted your patch to be merged. This has been a great deterrent and has limited community involvement. \nLibreOffice says \"Everyone is invited\". It is not an office suit which will be controlled by one organization, but many organizations will take part to develop it. The supporters include Google, RedHat, Canonical, Novell and a few more (not sure about the list).\nLibreOffice has also brought up a wikipage named \"Easy Hacks\" to get the community involved in the development. This is a great step as probably people would be excited to look at the code.\nFrom that page I can see that the codebase is a bit messy. There are non-English comments, bogus comments, dead code and what not.\nAnother good reason for breaking apart was that Oracle does not look interested in taking the development of Open Source ahead. OpenSolaris is nearly gone and if this fork didn't happen, probably OO.o would also have become stagnant.\n\nA: Libreoffice is a dedicated fork which aims to be free of Oracle's clutches. LibreOffice beta is mostly similar to OpenOffice \"as of now\", with just a few UI and branding changes, because they are based on the same source. You can expect big changes in the future as the paths are divergent. As for installing it, I'd say you can try LibreOffice without any apprehensions, though I personally recommend you to wait for a Final, stable release for pure goodness. For more details, you can go through the FAQ here. Please excuse me for the mistakes, if any. :)\n\nA: It's been a couple of months now since this question was asked but I wanted to stress how important it is to get as many contributors doing QA, ie. testing and using LibreOffice everyday and reporting any bugs and problems they may be facing.\nGetting on board early also lets you contribute in another way than coding - there are also documentation and translation efforts that can benefit from such early contributions.\n", "Q: How can I use bitmap fonts in gvim? When doing actual work, I can't stand the scalable monospaced fonts that are available to me with the default install.

On a server I've allowed some ports for this domain in the iptables configuration like the below entries:\n-A INPUT -s mycompany.dyndns.com -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -s mycompany.dyndns.com -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -s mycompany.dyndns.com -p tcp -m tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT\n\nBut when ever my modem restarts, I couldn't connect to these allowed ports as public ip changes with modem restart and are not updated in the iptables on the server. Is there any option to automatically update iptable rules on server.\n\nA: In short: no, the only way to update an iptables rule is to replace it (iptales -R ...) or to delete it and add a new one with the updated IP address (iptables -D ... followed by iptables -A ...).\nThis blog post discusses the issue and sketches a solution.\n\nA: \nBut when ever my modem restarts, I couldn't connect to these allowed ports as public ip >changes with modem restart and are not updated in the iptables on the server.\n\nEven though you are applying rules with a domain name, iptables will resolve to the public IP of given domain at that moment and apply rules with that public IP. \nSo with each modem restart or ISP IP lease time expiry, you have to update iptables with the newly allocated public IP.\nIf you list iptables rules, then it will be confusing as you can see rules that you applied with exact domain name.\niptables -L\n\nTo get clarity, save iptables rules to one file and verify. You can find resolved IP of your domain instead of domain name.\niptables-save > /tmp/iptables.rules\n\n\nA: You can achieve what you want in many different ways.\nPer instance, dig your Dyndns ip:\nYOURIP=\"$(dig yourdomain.ddns.net +short A)\"\n\nThen use the $YOURIP variable to check your IP regularly and add a firewall rule via a cron command\nDig is a well known utility for querying DNS servers, you can easily install it in your Linux distro should it not be readily available\n", "Q: Clone system and auto replicate the changes Is it possible to clone an Ubuntu system and if any changes are made to original system, those should be replicated to the one cloned?  I need to have backup support if original one gets down.  In my case, Ubuntu is a cloud server.\nPlease guide me step by step.\n\nA: I would use rsync with SSH keys over the network and set it to run frequently with cron.  This way, only the changes need to be transmitted.\nFormat taken from how do I do mass installs?\n#!/bin/bash\nrsync -avx --exclude=/proc --exclude=/dev --exclude=/tmp --exclude=/sys --delete-after root@${host}:/ /\n\nOn the machine that will serve as a backup, make a file named /etc/cron.daily/backup-pull then make it executable sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/backup-pull.  Replace ${host} with the IP of the original system.\nYou'll have daily syncs of the original server to this one. You could also do cron.hourly instead of cron.daily if you're really paranoid.\n\nA: Please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/SimpleBackupSuite and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , also Comparison of backup tools .\nIf you want to only save the changes in packages installed, etc, you can use dpkg --get-selections > installed_packages, and restore those with apt-get update && dpkg --set-selections < installed_packages && apt-get upgrade.\nTo backup your user files, it is sufficient to copy the /home directory to the remote server, refer to the second link.\n\nA: You probably want to use something like drbd.  Probably combined with something like Heartbeat.  More info about that on the Linux High Availability site.\nI suppose some cloud or cluster solutions come with similar functionality built-in or available as extensions, you might want to dig into their documentation.\n\nA: The data itself will need to be backed up by other means but for repeatable configurations I would really look at tools like preseed and puppet.  With puppet and preseed you also get the benefit of some level of self documentation on the configurations as well.\n\nA: You should use virtualisation. Software like KVM or Xen allow You to create a virtual machines, which are like normal machines, but You can clone them and copy to another physical machine.\nI cannot guide You step by stem because every situation is different. I recommend read a documentation on these sites and ask when You encounter a specific problem.\n\nA: Check out remastersys.\n Remastersys is a tool that can be used to do 2 things with an existing Debian,  Ubuntu or derivative installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*It can make a full system backup including personal data to a live cd or dvd that you can use anywhere and install.\n\n*It can make a distributable copy you can share with friends.

It just says \"Failed to compile module vmmon!\"\nIs this a problem of wmware, ubuntu or me? What do I have to do now? And why is there no \"apt-get install vmware-workstation\"-way?\n\nA: The supported method would wait for the next VMWare Workstation release, which will likely support the newer 10.10 Ubuntu release. \nIf you don't feel like waiting that long, you can patch your installation, as described at: debuntu.org: WMware Workstation 7.1 on Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat 10.10 \n\nA: Friend,\nUse the command chmod + x VMware-Workstation-7.1.2-full-301548.x86_64.bundle then type the command\n./VMware-Workstation-Full-7.1.2-301548.x86_64.bundle\n\nIf an error occurs.\naptitude update\nreboot\n\n", "Q: Change folder permissions and ownership I would like the user to have full rights on this folder (as well as all sub-directories and files in it):\n~/.blabla\n\ncurrently owned by root.\nI have found numerous posts (in this forum and elsewhere) on how to do this for files but I can't find a way to do it for whole folders.\n\nA: Use chown to change ownership and chmod to change rights.\nAs Paweł Karpiński said, use the -R option to apply the rights for all files inside of a directory too.\nNote that both these commands just work for directories too. The -R option makes them also change the permissions for all files and directories inside of the directory.\nFor example\nsudo chown -R username:group directory\n\nwill change ownership (both user and group) of all files and directories inside of directory and directory itself.\nsudo chown username:group directory\n\nwill only change the permission of the folder directory but will leave the files and folders inside the directory alone.\nAs enzotib mentioned, you need to use sudo to change the ownership from root to yourself.\nEdit:\nNote that if you use chown <user>: <file> (Note the left-out group), it will use the default group for that user. \nIf you want to change only the group, you can use:\nchown :<group> <file>\n\n\nA: If you prefer, this can be done with a GUI as well. You will need to open Nautilus as root to do so. Press Alt + F2 to access the \"Run Applications\" dialog and enter gksu nautilus\nNext, browse to and right click on the folder you would like to modify. Then, select \"Properties\" from the context menu. You can now select the user or group that you would like to be the \"Owner\" of the folder as well as the permissions you would like to grant them. Finally, press \"Apply Permissions to Enclosed Files\" to apply the changes recursively.\nThough it seems this does not always work for some operations in a deep folder tree. If it does not work use the appropriate terminal command.\n\n\nA: Make the current user own everything inside the folder (and the folder itself):\nsudo chown -R $USER ~/.blabla\n\n\nA: First, check demo.txt permissions:\n# ls -l demo.txt\n\nOut:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 31 05:48 demo.txt\n\nIn this example change file ownership to vivek user and list the permissions:\n# chown vivek demo.txt\n# ls -l demo.txt\n\nOut:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 vivek root 0 Aug 31 05:48 demo.txt\n\nIn this next example, the owner is set to vivek followed by a colon and group ownership is also set to vivek group, run:\n# chown vivek:vivek demo.txt\n# ls -l demo.txt\n\nOut:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 vivek vivek 0 Aug 31 05:48 demo.txt\n\n\nA: you can use it sudo chmod -R 777 /folderpath\nsuch as: sudo chmod -R 777 /opt/lampp/htdocs/ this is for xampp htdocs folder access\n\nA: If it's owned by root you can do this\nsudo chown <your username>:<your usergroup> -R <path to>/.blabla\n\nSince ./blabla owned by root you need to gain root privileges to change that. That's what sudo will do. The -R option for the chown command says: this directory and everything in it recursively.\n\nA: First chmod -R can mess up your system permissions if you do it on system file and directories by mistake.\nSecond chmod -R can mess up flags in those folders and is not a good idea to give permissions on some folders to all the users. \nYou should try and chown instead:\n sudo tree -fai ~/.blabla  | xargs -L1 -I{} sudo chown youruser:youruser {}\n\n\nA: you should try chmod -R\n\nA: sudo chown -R -ubuntu:ubuntu ~/PathTo/Folder/dist\nBefore Screenshot:\n\nAfter Screenshot:\n\n", "Q: How to highlight just the name (not the extension) for renaming?

I haven't been able to find information about Ubuntu 11.04. Is it already decided what's going to go into Natty Narwhal?\n\nA: Others have pointed out the uds-n sprint page already, so I will concentrate on answering information on how best to determine what might be in 11.04\nWe have a remote participation page so that users can follow along with the sessions. Every session on the schedule will have a corresponding IRC channel and a live audio stream.\nFor certain sessions that we think might be interesting to users we publish video proceedings of the sessions for each UDS, along with the plenary presentations. This should give you an idea of the process that Ubuntu developers use to select features for 11.04.\nOnce the blueprints are selected you can monitor the burndown charts (broken down by person and team) to see how progress of your favorite feature is coming along.\n\nA: It is very early in the release cycle so not much has been decided about the next release. You can see the planned features in the 11.04 blueprints page on launchpad.\nMost of the details of the changes will be decided in the Ubuntu Developers' Summit (UDS-N). It will start on the 25th of October and finish on the 29th. It is being held at the Caribe Royal in Orlando, Florida, USA.\nAs usual, videos of the UDS will be posted online and there will be IRC channels allowing you to join in with the discussion.\n\nA: While still celebreting the birth of Maverick, maybe its too early to answer this question. Ubuntu Developer Summit will be held on 25-29 October and thet have a busy agenda: https://launchpad.net/sprints/uds-n/+specs We need some time and patience, I think.\n\nA: Many shiny new things.\nThat's about as specific as anybody can be at the moment because even if somebody could say what they'd like to pull in or upgrade, chances are there still needs to be some development work.\nBut one major thing I will mention: 10.10 was supposed to be the first gnome-shell based release. Gnome v3 didn't make it out on time and they pushed back for March 2011... So there is a good possibility that Gnome 3 might make it into 11.04. \nWhether or not gnome-shell becomes the default desktop manager is a completely different question that probably only the design team can answer.\n\nA: Some time ago I read that a new sound theme was probably being made.

They basically say that one thing worth to try (and that solved my problem too) is to set either the whole system or the only the video-player to use X11 as the 'output' video.\nIn Ubuntu it can be done by (this I didn't try myself, I just copied and pasted here):\n\n\n*\n\n*For gstreamer applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*System --> Preferences --> Multimedia Systems Selector (If it's not there, you'll have to enable it by editing the menus.)\n\n*Click on the \"Video\" tab.\n\n*In the \"Default Output\" section, select X Window System (No Xv)` for the \"Plugin\".\n\n\n*In VLC it can be done by (that's the one I've done, but right now I can't remember the exact names of the tabs)\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferences --> Video --> Output --> X11\n\n\n\nReferences: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://ubuntuforum-br.org/index.php/topic,72867.0.html\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1476955\n", "Q: How to update Ubuntu when not connected to internet When I install Ubuntu to a set of computers that are not connected to the internet, and I need to get the lastest software updates, do I still need to connect them so they download the latest updates?  Or is there a better way?\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the updates in one connected PC, then copy them to a pen drive and intall it on the others (How?)\n\n*Find an image of the installation CD with the latest updates (possible?)\n\n\nI installed Xubuntu 10.04 on a couple of PC's with no connection.\nUpdate (10/15/2010)\nI made a Xubuntu 10.04 VM on my own PC, and I'm downloading all updates and necessary software.  I will then use one of the below mentioned alternatives to upgrade the computers.  Hopefuly I'll update them next Monday.\n\nA: Download the CD/DVD of choice and then:\nsudo apt-cdrom add\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThis will treat the CD as a repository and let you grab packages from it. However if you have non-standard packages that aren't on the CD, you might run into issues. There is (I believe this is still true) a DVD that has lots more packages on it that might help... But for general purpose upgrades, apt-cdrom should do fine.\nIf you're dealing with a network of computers (or something that could be hammered into a network) you could perhaps look at apt-proxy or another similar setup where you can host the repository locally for other computers to access. This may well be faster than taking a CD from computer to computer.\nSimilarly, you could share an ISO over the network and use apt-cdrom\n\nA: You will have to download the packages and package lists to one computer (apt-get update && apt-get upgrade, and then you can install them easily by copying /var/lib/apt/lists/ and /var/lib/apt/archives across to the other computers in question. They would have to have identical packages installed, though.\nThis way, you will only download the updates that you need, and no CDs or DVDs that would be somewhat a waste. The disks also will not include any packages that come from PPAs that you added manually.\n\nA: Aptoncd: http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/\nAPTonCD is a tool with a graphical interface which allows you to create one or more CDs or DVDs (you choose the type of media) with all of the packages you've downloaded via APT-GET or APTITUDE, creating a removable repository that you can use on other computers\n\nA: Keryx (meaning 'messenger') is a program which can be used in order to update systems which are not connected to the internet.\nBasically you need a system which is connected to the internet which will download the packages, and another system which you intend to install the applications and updates. We create a 'project' in the offline system, put it in a Removable Media and take it to the online system and use Keryx to download the packages.  Keryx will solve dependencies issues itself, then we can carry the Removable device back to the offline system and install the packages.\nProject Web Site - http://keryxproject.org/\n", "Q: B43 Wireless not working on 2.6.35 kernel After upgrading to kernel version 2.6.35 (went from 10.04 to 10.10), my wireless card stopped working. I'm currently using the Broadcom STA wireless driver (proprietary).\nHave anyone found any fix to this issue besides using a previous kernel version?\nThanks! \n\nA: By default when you upgrade from one release to another, all of the proprietary drivers are disabled.  You need to use the 'Hardware Drivers' application to reenable them.\n\nA: Try installing the one from the Broadcom website. It's here. Follow the instructions in the readme.\nAlternatively, try reinstalling the driver, it worked for me once.\n\nA: Neither reinstalling the firmware from the command line nor building the driver from source provided by Broadcom in @evgeny 's link worked for me when I had the same problem with my Compaq Presario V5000 with the B43 3418 chipset.\nBut using ndiswrapper did work. (I used the ndisgtk GUI and this driver)\n\nA: There's a specific package available for B43 firmware -\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nThat should auto-launch a quick update process which downloads the latest version and applies it.  You shouldn't even have to access Jockey afterwards - it stops/starts the card on the fly.\n\nA: If you can't get the Linux drivers to work, your best bet at getting the wireless card to work would be to install the drivers via ndiswrapper. You need to extract the .exe file for the Windows version of the driver and find the .inf file needed for setup. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 9.04 not starting after Installation I am a quite new user of Ubuntu.

The screen turns black and shows the error GLib-WARNING **: getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (0), although this error is completely unrelated to the actual problem.\nPrevious searches on the internet indicate that this error is unrelated to the bug I'm experiencing. It is suggested that Ubuntu tries to hibernate or suspend and that you're seeing the black screen running 'behind' the X server. That would explain the fact that curiously you still see—but cannot move—the mouse cursor.\nI've already set all the values of the GConf keys in /apps/gnome-power-manager/actions/ to 'nothing', disabled all power management actions I could find, but it didn't solve the problem. It is important to note that the freeze doesn't happen immediately after you unplug the AC power lead. The icon in the notification area may have changed already, but the freeze only occurs when the Notify OSD bubble appears that tells you how many time is left with your battery.\nDoes anyone here have a clue about this problem? A workaround or the cause?

When I had XP and I was running on battery the screen would lock up and look like two screens overlayed over each other but slightly off. Nothing would work. Now that I'm running ubuntu it still happens, the same screen look and everything. Obviously a hardware issue. I think it has something to do with the CPU throttling. When its plugged in its running at 100%, but I think when its unplugged its selectively running different process speeds.

I am curious, does SSH compress its data before sending/receiving it? If it does not by default, then can it be turned on? \n\nA: No and yes. Kind of. Which is to say, it supports compression (zlib or zlib-ish, as I recall), but a stock copy of OpenSSH does not have it enabled by default, though some distributions may enable it by default (I don't think Ubuntu does).\nSee man ssh_config for details. You're looking for the Compression and CompressionLevel options, which you can then set in /etc/ssh/ssh_config.\nNote that there's also a Compression option for the server side in sshd_config which determines if compression is allowed (it is by default). Again, see man sshd_config for details.\nYou can also turn compression on on a per-session basis by using the command line option -C.\nNote that compression can actually have a slightly negative performance impact if the connection between you and the server is fast (e.g. on the same LAN or just on really good internet connections) or one or both sides has a slow CPU (compression eats a fair bit of CPU time).\nThese days, for most people, I'd suggest using it only as needed. Typically for links of less than 5-10mbps and only when passing a lot of bulk data (transfers of not-already-compressed files, X11 or VNC forwarding, things like that).\n\nA: You can turn on gzip compression on any SSH. Put Compression yes into your ~/.ssh/config, and it should work. Alternatively, try running ssh with the -C option.\n\nA: From the ssh man page (type man ssh to see the whole thing):\n -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,\n         stderr, and data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections).  The\n         compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the\n         “level” can be controlled by the CompressionLevel option for pro-\n         tocol version 1.  Compression is desirable on modem lines and\n         other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast\n         networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis\n         in the configuration files; see the Compression option.\n\nSo just change:\nssh hostname\n\nto:\nssh -C hostname\n\n\nA: Easiest why is to use the -o option, on the cli. It can be used with any config option as well eg\nssh -o \"Compression no\" -v <HOST>\n# or\nssh -o \"Compression yes\" -v <HOST>\n\n\nA: you can switch on the compression with -C but it won't work if the server is not allowed to spend kernel power for it by not allowing compression for this. For example, I did, because of this, change the Host location of some own data from Strato to a server of mine. I recognised it because of the usage of a slow 2Mbit download and 0,3Mbit upload connection and did check out the speed difference depending on the compression level as higher level isn't allways quicker as it sucks of your processor power or the server power.\nbut in my case it does a good job as it is shorten the needed time to a 6th of the time before.\n", "Q: grub overwrites windows boot manager after every update error: no such device: (hard drive serial number).\ngrub rescue>\nThats what i get after every update, I know how to recover from this error.

You should use BURG for it. The only thing you can do is, changing GRUB's background with the themes' one. But you can't get OS icons etc. on GRUB.\n\nA: BURG's theme syntax is very similar to GRUB2's (because BURG's theme engine is a fork of GRUB2's).

The new indicator-appmenu in Maverick breaks the LyX menu: the application menu is not shown either in the application window nor in the applet.

Something akin to Maximus exceptions.\n\nA: Run an application\n\n\n*\n\n*To start an application (eg., gcalctool) with the menu within the application rather than in the panel, run the following in a terminal:\nUBUNTU_MENUPROXY= gcalctool\n\nTo start the application with the menu enabled in the application and the panel, run:\nAPPMENU_DISPLAY_BOTH=1 gcalctool\n\n\n*Instead of using the terminal, you can use the Alt + F2 shortcut to start a run dialog, in which you would enter:\nenv UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= gcalctool\n\nor\nenv UBUNTU_DISPLAY_BOTH=1 gcalctool\n\nEdit application launchers in Ubuntu 10.10\nTo make it easier to always launch your application with the same appmenu settings, you can edit application launchers in the menu, the gnome-panel, and on the desktop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome-panel and desktop: simply right-click the launcher, select \"Properties\" and prepend env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= or env UBUNTU_DISPLAY_BOTH=1 to the value in the \"Command\" field:\n(source: xrmb2.net) \n\n*Menu: right-click the menu and select \"Edit Menus\". In the new window, find the launcher you want to edit and click the \"Properties\" button on the right.

I want to upgrade my Ubuntu Lucid to Kubuntu Maverick (with a fresh install of course). I want to try KDE, but I have heard there are slight issues with the native Qt applications  compared to the GTK application equivalents - such as nvidia-settings, Gimp, Ubuntu Software Centre, and especially th eSynaptic package manager (which in detail showed the administration package / KPackageKit is not powerful yet than synaptic)\nI believe we can have run GTK+ applications in KDE, but GTK+ applications do not blend with the KDE desktop. Also Java does not provide a GUI for KDE/Qt.\nShould I install Kubuntu (KDE/Qt) or stay with ubuntu (GNOME/GTK +)?\n\nA: Using Ubuntu (Gnome-desktop) or Kubuntu (KDE-desktop) is in the end a choice of preference and maybe what applications you use more.\nYou can even install both, by making sure that both packages, ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop are installed. With this setup you can decide when you login, which desktop you want to use (or with the change user option have both desktops running at the same time).\nif you want to have a better blend of GTK apps in KDE, you can select the Curve theme for them in the settings (I think it is in appearances in system-settings).\nI do not think there is a real objective answer more than this for your question, and we do not want to start any flaming here :)\n\nA: In addition do txwikinger answer, I can say that Ubuntu is Canonical's flagship product and it is polished more (for example: Software Center, UbuntuOne Client).\nSo I would stick with Ubuntu, but install kubuntu-desktop package and try it yourself :)\n\nA: I started with Ubuntu 9.10 and moved to Kubuntu 9.10 shortly after. I run both KDE and Gnome apps on Kubuntu with no real issues.\n\nA: I tried Kubuntu 10.10 last night and decided to go back to Ubuntu for these reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kubuntu was slightly slower and had more lag.   This was probably because it had an easier time detecting the video card and enabling the desktop effects.   My Ubuntu install still can use desktop effects even after enabling the NVidia driver.  Need to investigate.\n\n*The Ubuntu 10.10 startup and shutdown is a lot cleaner looking.   With Kunbuntu, during shutdown some messages are thrown to the screen.  After installing a ton of Gnome apps, my Kubuntu system wouldn't start the X display any more and locked up on startup.  Too unstable for me to continue using.\n\n*The WIFI settings on Ubuntu, and the prompt for keyring, is prompted only once on Ubuntu but Kubuntu asks me to enter my password 3 times.... annoying.\n\n*Kubuntu had a \"Desktop Widget\" type of presentation whereas Ubuntu is simple and more elegant/traditional.   Kubuntu also had a app menu that looks like Windows7 but I prefer the simpler Win2000 type of menu.\n\n*The placement of shutdown button is much better in Ubuntu, at the upper right corner of screen.\n\nA: I have used Xubuntu for many years and its great (simple but great). For some years I used Ubuntu at work and Xubuntu in my home computer. Now I use Xubuntu at work and Kubuntu in my home computer, why?\nI feel that Xubuntu is faster in terms of response and in my job, I want it fast!\nUbuntu is a good choice if you want a balance between performance and beauty.\nKubuntu is (IMHO) more beauty and in general, easier to use and to customize. It comes with a price tag: performance and stability (yea, playing around with widgets may crash your X session, but it is not a big deal).\nI personally like that in order to add window themes, wallpapers, colors, icons, etc. its as easy as choosing from a list (online) and one click. \nIf you are worry about synaptic, in Maverick you may not even notice any difference while using the Software Center. I personally recommend you to learn \"aptitude\" instead of synaptic as in my experience it is more useful. \nAnyway, don't worry too much about which one to use... install both and try both.\nHave fun!\n\nA: I run a hybrid and everything works great. K3b works fine when I use GNOME and I use the GIMP all of the time in KDE. It does not matter much which you use. \nKwallet manages KDE applications in GNOME and the Gnome keyring manages GNOME applications in Kubuntu. You can use Nautilus in KDE as long as you launch it from the commandline with nautilus --no-desktop, other wise it takes over your desktop with GNOME. You can use Software Centre and Ubuntu One in Kubuntu just fine. \nI don't know why anyone would possibly think that Ubuntu is more polished. I agree that it is the flagship but we all know what happens to flagships (Titanic was a flagship and so was the Mary Rose). GNOME needs more polish than that to be on par with KDE 4.5, IMO. Feature for feature, there is no comparison.\n", "Q: Change default compress option in Nautilus type to zip? On the right click menu (in Nautilus, desktop, etc), there is a \"compress\" option.

To set zip as the default compression method, hit Alt+F2 to launch the 'Run Application' window. Type 'gconf-editor' in the box and hit the 'Run' button. This can be seen in the screenshot below.\n\nOnce you hit the 'Run' button, a window like the one below will appear.

It's a good solution to access AFP shares on a network. There is a good explanation in this blog post.\n\nA: I think your problem is that samba is not installed by default?\nTry\nsudo apt-get install samba\n\n\nA: Gnome, through Nautilus and GVFS can mount network shares on login and this wouldn't be available for KDE to access. KDE, via KIO Slaves, can do this as well, or it can be done through the command line. If Samba was working in Gnome it is probably still there.\nIn Konqueror type smb:/ or sftp:/ in the location bar to use common protocols for mounting shares, mac servers can do either I believe. \nIf you needed access w/out KDE or Gnome running you could use fuse-smb for samba or curlftpfs for ftp access, but KDE should be as convenient as Gnome at doing this for you. I use KDEWallet to automount certain network drives.\nSamba can be configured through KDE's System Settings -> Sharing. Or possibly System Settings -> Advanced -> Samba.\nIf you still need help please edit with whether it's a server at work, in a mixed mac/win/*nix environment and whether this is the same install/if Gnome is sill installed.\n\nA: i have also faced similar problem after switching from Gnome to KDE on Ubuntu Lucid.

I'm looking in to gaming on Ubuntu (using PlayOnLinux - i.e. wine). What is the most modern game you have run at an acceptable framerate and what hardware were you running? Did you have to tweak your wine or gfx card settings? If so, how?\n\nA: Before everybody lists out every single game they've played on Ubuntu through Wine, check appdb for specific games you want to run on Wine. Some work at near-native speeds, some don't work at all.\nHowever, the \"most modern\" games I own are Modern Warfare 2, Dragon Age: Origins and Fallout 3. All work fine on my i7 920 + Nvidia GTX260 but then again, I didn't buy them until I knew they would. In a perfect world, MW2 could run a little faster.\nDragon Age and Fallout both took a lot of wine-hacking to get working originally - They're somewhat easier now but I still patch in WinePulse to simplify audio problems.\nFor Source games (that is Valve, not the open- variety) like HL2, Left 4 Dead, TF2, etc, you'll find that things run pretty well.\n\nA: HalfLife 2, Left4Dead, Left4Dead2, Civilization V, Team Fortress 2 etc. with Codeweavers CX Games. Buy CX Games - it's a lot easier to use than wine and you will support wine development with your donation either.\n\nA: For me, it was MLB 2k9 which amazingly runs pretty much flawlessly in Wine. The frame rates are around 20-30% slower than Windows - but still acceptable.\nThe cool thing was that it ran in Wine unmodified. (No tweaks or fiddling around.)\nDisclaimer: I didn't test installing it.

I'm using maverick desktop edition and I'd like to use indicator-datetime instead of the usual clock. I installed it using software center but even after restarting I don't find it in the \"Add to panel\" list. Maybe I'm trying to install it in the wrong way? Or should I add that indicator using terminal? If so, could you tell me how to do that? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Currently your indicator menus are loaded by either indicator-applet or indicator-applet-session, and none of those show the indicator-datetime menu.  You can replace those 2 applets, plus the old clock applet by 1 single applet indicator-applet-complete (and you have to install that one first).  The indicator-applet-complete applet will show indicator-datetime if it's installed.\nSo currently you have the following applets at the right side of the panel:\n| notification area | indicator-applet | clock | indicator-applet-session |\n\nAnd you have to change it to:\n| notification area | indicator-applet-complete |\n\n\nA: You need to add a menu entry:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to ‘System > Preferences > Main Menu’\n\n*Choose ‘Accessories’ in the left-hand list\n\n*Click on the ‘New Item’ button\n\n*Choose a name and enter ‘indicator-workspaces’ for the command\n\n*Finalize by clicking the ‘Add’ button\n\n", "Q: What is the function of procfs? sysfs makes perfect sense -- it represents the system, and is mounted under /dev. procfs, which gets mounted to /proc, is much more nebulous however. What are procfs & /proc used for?\n\nA: Historically (years before Linux), /proc came first, and contained one file per process. Each (pseudo)-file provided access to the memory of the process, e.g., reading byte number 0x1234 from the file gave you the contents of address 0x1234 in the process's virtual memory. This interface was used by commands such as ps (the original process information viewer) and debuggers.\nSubsequent variants of Unix copied the principle, but not the details. For example, on Linux, there is one directory per process, containing various information in a readable form. For example /proc/1/cwd is a symbolic link to the current working directory of process 1, and /proc/1/cmdline is a file containing the command line arguments.\nBecause it was there, Linux also used /proc to provide system information, such as /proc/cpuinfo containing information about the CPU (microprocessor) and /proc/bus/usb/ containing information about USB devices. The documentation of /proc is in the kernel documentation in filesystems/proc.txt.\nLater, /sys (the sysfs filesystem) came to provide information about the kernel. For example, there is information about USB devices under /sys/bus/usb (in a different format from /proc/bus/usb), and information about kernel modules (as well as interfaces to control some modules) under /sys/modules.\nNote that /proc/sys is not the same thing as /sys. /proc/sys shows a specific set of runtime-configurable kernel parameters called sysctl parameters.\nYou will find more historical and current information about /proc on Wikipedia.\n¹ or more precisely, the proc filesystem, which can be mounted in other locations (but not having it available at /proc will break a lot of programs).\n\nA: /proc is a real-time api to the kernel. You can set kernel variables, or retrieve kernel information. procfs is analogically a file system simulation to be able to communicate with the kernel via the file system.\nEach process has its own directory under /proc with the process id as the name. In this directory you can find all kind of information the kernel has for the particular process. \nOther directories allow to either get kernel statistics (like /proc/meminfo) or information (like /proc/cpuinfo) or you can configure certain things (like /proc/sys/vm/swappiness allows you to change how the kernel will use the swap space).\n\nA: procfs presents information about your running processes.\nFor example:\n$ sleep 120 &\n[2] 11581\n$ ls /proc/11581\n...\ncmdline\ncwd\n...\n$ cat /proc/11581/cmdline\nsleep120\n\n\nA: A bit of a variation on some answers.\n/proc is a file-system representation of the currently running processes. You don't go anywhere special, if you can read files, you can interact with the kernel. procfs is just the implementation of that.\nThe philosophy here is: Use the small tools like grep and friends to interact with things like processes vs writing specialized tools to interact with processes.\n", "Q: Is there any way or theme that shows one applications' menu bar next to its title? I'm looking for a way to put the menu bar on the same line of the title bar if the latter fits in the former.\n\nIs there anything like that out there?\n\nA: No, I don't think there is any window manager out there that does this.\nThis is because the menu is part of the application and the window border is usually handled by the window manager.\n\nA: There is only an idea on ubuntu brainstorm: http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/9417/\nYou can promote this solution.\n\nA: That would mean that someone has to integrate the menu bar into the window manager. There is a project out there called gnome global menu. They took the menu bar and turned it into a gnome panel applet. So it should not be too hard to do this. As for now I don't know of any window manager that has done this.\n", "Q: How to create deb package from Windows applications?

Fine for personal use, but it would never get accepted into Ubuntu proper.\nI'm not sure about your level of knowledge about debian packaging, but giving a whole packaging tutorial is out of scope for this. If you need further information, the Ubuntu Packaging Guide is a good place to start, and of course there is always the Debian New Maintainer's Guide.\nEssentially all you need to do is use dh_install to drop the files in the right place. So something like this in you debian/my_package_name.install file:\napplication-name.exe          /opt/application-name/\napplication-name.desktop      /usr/share/applications/\n\n\nA: This is something I've personally experimented with a few times, and even made proof of concept packages.  There are also a few ad-hoc packages in the archive such as pq (Progress Quest), although none of them are particularly complicated.\nI suggest you follow the specification here: https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/software-center/+spec/other-n-wine-software-center  -- At the Developer Summit this month I hope to standardize the way we do this, or even develop a tool to do so, as I expect to have an awful lot of Windows packages in the medium term.\n", "Q: Is there a free VPN service that works on Ubuntu?

You might want to contact them about that.\n\nA: To clarify, openvpn is NOT the answer, nor is any proxy server - because the QUESTION is about free vpn \"services\", not free vpn \"servers\" (huge difference!), nor proxy servers (even bigger difference).\nThe only free VPN service that works on Ubuntu is cyberghost.\n\nA: You can use this website to configure the PPTP that's built in on Linux \nhttp://www.freecanadavpn.com/\nI have tested it and it works perfectly. \n\nA: VPN One Click is free (for one year) for Linux, Windows and Android.\n\nA: Free VPN Connect for Linux\nI just created script for automatic instant free OpenVPN connections to multiple free VPN services.\nYou can download it on GitHub.\nSupported free services:\nwww.vpnbook.com\nwww.freevpn.me\nwww.vpnkeys.com  \nScript is automatic and takes all advertising money from service providers for not visiting their web pages, so plese donate.\nEDIT: You must be administrator to establish connection to VPN\n\nA: VpnReactor works pretty well https://www.vpnreactor.com/ and has nice free plan.\nThere is a tutorial how to install it on Linux.\n\nA: Ubuntu provides openvpn as a package that can be used to create virtual private networks between different computers over a public network.\n", "Q: How to use network scanner (Samsung Clx 2160n) I have a Samsung Clx2120N multi-functional (scanner, printer and copier) and this is connected to router (home office), I have two computers and one notebook in the network, but no has a server printer, all equipment send jobs for print direct, they have a network printer configured.

However, I did find this email. It suggests an application called gpe-clock. The application is not the most visually appealing with a dark panel theme, but it does support adding a basic analogue clock to the panel. This is what it looks like:\n\nSo as you can see, the clock is very basic, but it is analogue. The email says:\n\nTo put the newly installed applet on your panel, you need to right-click \n  on an empty space on the panel bar and click on \"Add to panel...\".\n  For the rest, you should have no problems.\n\nHowever, gpe-clock did not show up in the list of applets for me. I had to go to Applications->Accessories->Alarm clock to add it.\nYou can set it to analogue mode by clicking on the applet and selecting 'Preferences'. From there, simply select 'Analogue format' and hit 'OK'.\n\nA: At this point in time, I have not seen any applet for an analogue clock.  In the era before Gnome 2, I do remember having one.  \nAccording to all my searches (forums, freshmeat, gtkapps, etc) the closest solution is a dock (like docky or awn) or cairo-clock.

This is especially true if you're a power user, and use Lightroom as a professional tool.\nIf you really do rely heavily on Lightroom, and aren't able to find an acceptable native alternative, you might want to consider dual-booting, using Virtualbox to run Windows under Ubuntu, running Lightroom on a separate machine, or just resigning yourself to using Windows or OS X.\nBest of luck!\n\nA: Have you checked out the entry in the Wine Application Database?:\nhttp://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=20512\nSee if that helps at all.\n\nA: Not really an answer to your question, but you might also want to have a look at DarkTable.

Is it possible to set the GPU fan speed using the default free ati driver?\nMy card (X1900) was deprecated in the fglrx drivers a while back.\nThe free drivers seem to work with 3D, Compiz and such, but running graphics intensive programs makes my GPU heat up and produce artifacts, while the GPU fan never seems to increase. (When set to 100% in Windows it makes a massively louder noise.)\n\nA: Ok because no one else is willing to say anything. lm-sensors is the package in ubuntu that will help with your quest the first thing to find out is whether lm-sensors detects your gpu temperature sensor as this is what will probably control the speed of the GPU cooler fan. To test whether your gpu temp is detected you will need to paste this command in a terminal first.\nsudo sensors-detect\n\nThis will go through a sensor detection script it will then output a section of code to add to your modules file which will load additional modules specific for your system.

It's asking me where to install the program to. I don't want it cluttering up my home directory, and I want it to be available in the applications menu. Where should I put it? /usr/bin? /usr/local/bin? Or are those only for single binaries? This program wants to create a folder.\n\nA: For all path-related questions, the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is the definitive reference.\nIf the program needs to create a folder, then /usr/local is the directory of choice; according to the FHS:\n\nThe /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when installing\nsoftware locally.\n\nAvoid placing your local binaries directly under /usr, because according to the FHS, that hierarchy is reserved for the software provided by the Linux distribution (in this case, Ubuntu).\nNote that, placing a binary in /usr/local/bin (or any other bin directory) will not create a menu entry; for that you have to provide a .desktop file and install it in the appropriate directory with the xdg-desktop-menu command.\n\nA: First of all which Application are you installing? It is always preferable to install through the native Package Management as the Package Manager will handle the location, updates, paths and the launchers (shortcuts) for you. Also updates would be handled. You should ideally search for the package in the Software Center or Synaptic. PPAs can be used if the software is not in the default repos.\nHowever if you are sure of installing this package, use /opt directory, /opt/appname for example. /opt would be suitable for this kind of installs. Launchers may or may not be created depending on the installer. You can create a launcher manually if the installer doesn't create. You may also use $HOME/bin for putting all your apps.\n\nA: Usually you would put it in /usr, binaries in /usr/bin if it's something bigger it would go to /opt.\n", "Q: Can I list a repository content before adding it to search for a package? I want to keep my /etc/apt/sources.list clean and I'm looking for a way to look for a package in a repository before adding it to my system.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You can browse the link to the repository in your browser. if you look there for the Packages files (usually Packages.gz and Packages.bz2) in the correct folder under dists, you can download that file and uncompress it. It contains a list of all the packages of the archive.\n\nA: For example; if the repository is: http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/; you could simple enter the site with web browser and look for the package you want.

There is an http://owa.ourserver.com that is accessible from anywhere. I've tried every combo I can think of for Evolution -> Microsoft Exchange, including the MAPI plugin, but then I read that, that doesn't work on OWA Exchange email servers and I can't get it to connect at all that way.\nIf there is no way to connect via Evolution, is there another mail client? I tried Thunderbird, but I couldn't get it to work with Exchange either...\n\nA: Had the same problem in my company. \nThe solution is installation of evolution-mapi (apt-get install evolution-mapi). Then go to Evolution and add an account, select Exchange from the drop-down menu and enter your server details and credentials. In the server address box type the server's IP address, as the mapi seems to have a bug using FQDMs. \n\nA: OWA is Outlook Web Access for Exchange.   To setup up Evolution to work with exchange you will need the Exchange server addresses not the Web Access front end.\nMy suggestion is to check with your IT/SysAdmin for the Exchange addresses.  Some companies have Exchanged lock to be only accessed through the OWA or select users on desktop clients (my former employer was that way).  Permissions may need to be set for you.\nThe configuration process can be checked out here:\ngnome documentation library - adding exchange account to evolution\n\nA: You should try DavMail Exchange Gateway.\nYou can use it \"standalone\" on your own computer, or on a server so you can share it with other colleagues.\nBasically, this application connects to the Exchange server (you can use the web address you gave) and translates all Exchange specific stuff into standards protocols: POP, IMAP, Caldav, SMTP, Carddav or LDAP. So you can access e-mails, calendar and contacts (included corporate ones) from this application.\nThen, you just have to configure Thunderbird or Evolution, etc. to connect to this application instead of Exchange.\nIt works like a charm on Windows, Linux and Mac OS. There is a 'deb' package in the download section of the project web-site, so you can easily install it on Ubuntu.\nThen, you can launch it from the Applications->Internet menu.\n\nA: I have evolution working in the past connecting evolution using the EWS plug in for evolution our address was https://owa.companyname.com/owa/EWS/Exchange.asmx\n\nA: I tried DavMail Gateway and wasn't super impressed:\n\n\n*\n\n*It has to run constantly in the background\n\n*It uses over 100 MB of memory\n\n*It was buggy; for instance, it would duplicate calendar events if the event was moved to a different time\n\n\nIf IMAP isn't enabled on your Exchange server, DavMail Gateway is probably your best bet. But if IMAP Is enabled, I recently came across a much better solution. It's a Thunderbird add-on called Exchange EWS Provider that's currently being maintained by Ericsson and handles Exchange calendar, tasks, and contact synchronization. It supports Exchange 2007, 2010, 2013, and even Exchange Online/Office 365. \nExchange EWS Provider doesn't have the bugs that I ran into with DavMail, it only runs when Thunderbird is open, and it uses far less memory, less than 9 MB (according to Thunderbird's about:memory):\n13.27 MB (05.33%) -- add-ons\n│   ├───8.63 MB (03.47%) -- exchangecalendar@extensions.1st-setup.nl/js-non-window/zones/zone(0x7fced7ddb800)\n\nInstallation is easy.

I have a dual boot windows7 and Ubuntu 10.04.1 on a run-of-the-mill hard drive. In a day or two I will get a new 64GB SSD in the mail and want to boot from that for obvious reasons. I was wondering if there was an easy way to transfer both OS's from my current hard drive to my SSD. I would normally reinstall the two on the new disk but my windows7 product key only works for activation once and I would like to keep it. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I highly recommend clonezilla. It will allow you to take an image of your entire drive, and then intelligently put it onto the new drive. It's really brilliant software.\n\nA: You can set up your new drive with partitions the same size as your old one. Then you can copy the partitions from the old harddrive to the new using the command dd using the block devices in /dev (i.e dd if=/dev/sda1  of=/dev/sdb2 bs=1024 etc).\nFinally you need to re-install grub in the MBR of your new drive. Some explanation how to do this are on Ubuntu's help wiki.\n\nA: i dont have full info, just tips... sorry :(\n\n\n*\n\n*you can use gparted (gui) instead dd (console) to copy partition data.

I already have windows he installed on my computer in a separate partition. I would like to be able to use this with VirtualBox, but I'm unsure how to do this. Since my computer came with windows installed, I do not have a windows instillation disc. Is there a way to create an .iso file that contains my windows installation? There are a few programs under windows but I really would like to use, but they do not have a linux equivalent.\n\nA: Yes its possible, to run windows (at real partition in your hd) in native and at virtualbox, but (we always have \"but\") its more problems than honey. \n\n\n*\n\n*we have chance to catastrophic errors (boot active host linux as guest) \n\n*windows detect a new hardware (now its virtualbox hardware) \n\n*maybe you need re-register windows \n\n*and for sure need reinstall lot of drivers \n\n\nI try it. Sure you have solution for each above points, but you get more problems than solutions. Its a lot easy install a new windows and re-install windows app you need. \n(my 5 cents)  \n\nA: I am not sure if it is possible to virtualize a real partition using vbox or vmware but I am pretty sure there is a program installed in your windows partition that will make recovery discs for your notebook. Every notebook, that has windows preinstalled, also has an application to create recovery discs. This usually needs two DVDs and should be found under start menu > programs\nYou could use that to create a vbox image to run when in ubuntu.. Btw did you try to run those windows apps using wine?\nLet us know what notebook do you have? manufacturer, model etc. also what programs do you want to run that you can't find equivalent in ubuntu?\n\nA: There's a guide on VirtualBox site for this topic.\nI'd stick with dual boot option in your case - most likely the pre-installed Windows system you've got has lots of hardware specific programs which will be a real headache in virtualized environment.

Continuing my question in Install Ubuntu or Kubuntu?\nI have tried Kubuntu (KDE), and it was very cool as cool as Ubuntu (GNOME). but there is little problem with its user interface when we start Java application (LimeWire, Netbeans, Eclipse). User interface changed to Metal, (which I think is a bit old school).\nCan we run it with Qt like UI?, such as when we start Java application in Gnome (run with GTK like UI/emulation GTK like UI)?\nI hear there is a class for Java in order to make Java application UI like Qt, called the Qt/Jambi bindings for Java. How can we integrate it in KDE when we start Java application?\nMy other question is if not wrong, OpenOffice was built in Java,so why OpenOffice can run with Qt like UI in KDE?\n\nA: Using those Qt bindings is no solution (it requires that the whole application's GUI has to be rewritten).\nAnd OpenOffice.org is written in C++ mostly, with some parts written in other languages like Java.  It also has its own GUI toolkit that can mimic Gtk or Qt (partially) using themes.\nAnd if there is no Qt or KDE-like theming included, I have no idea how to make one.  (I just saw that there are a couple of additional Swing themes in the repository, that might be a thing to try out for those applications that use Swing.)\n\nA: One solution is to use some sort of aesthetically Qt-compatible GTK theme, through the java GTK Style look and feel.\nIn Kubuntu, for GTK applications you can install the Qt Curve theme (qtcurve package), you should then be able to configure the default GTK style in KDE System Settings (you will need the kde-config-gtk package).\nYou should then be able to set the GTK look and feel in java applications. You can easily test it with this Java Web Start application.\n\nA: Install gtk3-engines-oxygen for Gtk3 and gtk2-engines-qtcurve for Gtk2, and switch to theme in System Settings > Application Appearance > Gtk Configuration.\nIf you don't have a Gtk Configuration, install kde-config-gtk. It's also recommended to install whole qtcurve packages and use it.\n", "Q: Automatic Mute Speakers When Headphones are Unplugged I listen to music almost any time I am on my computer.

Maybe this page will help You.\n\nA: My original answer was simply \"Just click on sound preferences, and choose to use \"analog headphones\" in the \"output\" settings. Let me know if this doesn't help.\"\nEDIT/UPDATE: okay, this may not work nicely if you have your alsa configured so that it automatically mutes speakers when headphones are plugged in. You may need to disable that if you have it set.\nAnyway, get some music anything with sound playing so you can test your sound output. Now open your Terminal console and type alsamixer. Check it out. Pretty cool, right? Here, you can adjust the volume levels for master, headphone, speaker, as well as other inputs/outputs.\nIn alsamixer, set your volume how you want it for when your speakers are on. Headphones can be at any volume you like. I'd put your \"speaker\" at 100% and your master at ~75%. We are going to save this in a profile now! Hit escape to exit alsamixer. If you open it again, you will see that your settings are still saved.\nAfter you have set volume how you want it for having your speakers on, type in the console, alsactl -f filename store except change \"filename\" to whatever you want to call it. I called mine noheadph.alsa. Now go back into alsamixer and set your headphone volume up, and your speakers at 0%, leaving master volume wherever you prefer it. Exit alsamixer by hitting escape, and save this profile by typing alsactl -f filename store except this time, replace \"filename\" with something relevant, such as \"headph.alsa\". Now, you can recall/restore to either of these profiles by typing alsactl -f filename restore obviously replacing \"filename\" with whatever you named your stored profiles. Isn't this cool?! Note that the profiles should be stored in your home user directory.\nWhat's left? Just bind a keystroke restore one profile, and another to restore the other one! How? On the OS menu Go to System> Preferences> Keyboard Shortcuts. Here, click \"add\" to add a new shortcut. I named mine \"set soundout headphones only\" and entered the command alsactl -f /home/username/headph.alsa restore except change \"username\" to your user account name. I think you get the gist! :)\nPlease tell me how it goes for you.\nThanks to this thread for the alsamixer info, etc.\nP.S.

I was wondering if there was a way to do it system wide so that it would work the same for Chromium, etc as well?\n\nA: With GNOME 3.0 and Ubuntu 11.10, things changed compared to the accepted answer to this question.\nYou can find more details at \"Creating custom URL handlers in Ubuntu 11.04, 11.10, GNOME 3.0\".\n\nA: Not system-wide. But the Gnome registry thingy has entries for that. Use gconf-editor and edit sub entries for /desktop/gnome/url-handlers. See also here http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=710780&postcount=6\nKDE obviously has a different URI handler database. There is also xdg-open worth looking into. But I'm not sure if it uses a standardized handler database, or if freedesktop.org is working on it. Sparse docs.\nPersonally I wish they would just use the xdg-mime (and application) database for that. There are pseudo uri/* types in it anyway. And it was somewhat more systematic if you could define handler applications and preference lists for them like with regular MIME types. </rant>\n", "Q: Reset the icons after upgrade I've noticed screenshots of 10.10 with these rather cooler looking square icons. However when I upgraded my machines I didn't receive and icon upgrade. Is this because it wasn't a fresh install and is retaining old style data - or is this a custom addition?\n\nA: You're not missing anything. These icons are not the new default, but a new third party theme, the Faenza icon theme. You can grab them from GNOME-Look or the Equinox PPA.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tiheum/equinox\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install faenza-icon-theme\n\n\n\nA: I usually manually install the Faenza theme (in fact, it might be even faster then adding all the repositories etc.), because it makes it easier to\n\n\n*\n\n*modify the theme: for example, the author has recently changed the chromium browser icon to a new uglier one (some may like it better, though), also, some other icons look ugly in systray (because they are colored and do not fit the rest of the theme -- I have them changed)\n\n*add icons\n\n*or even combine themes (for example, another excellent theme is UBO but you may want keep tray icons from Faenza)\n\n*recover all the changes you made whenever you need to reinstall the system or upgrade it etc.\n\n\n...also, I am usually just curious what's inside...\nSo make a folder, for example, ~/Themes/Icons. Go to gnome-look.org, in the left menu click All, then click Highest Rated: you will see the first top rated thing among all stuff they have is the Faenza Icon theme version 0.9.2 (the latest version).\nDownload it, unpack, you will see four folders inside for 4 different flavours of systray icons (light, dark, darker, darkest). Each folder is an icon theme: it contains index.theme which describes all subfolders with icons.\nTo install one of these 4 themes just compress the corresponding folder (right click on it -- there should be the option to compress), then open Appearance and move with the mouse your archive to the Appearance window, that is it.\nBut now you have all the freedom to do whatever you want with the theme, add/modify icons, combine themes, etc. More importantly, whenever you reinstall (or upgrade) the system, all the changes you made will be waiting for you right there, so that you will be back with your favorite icon theme in a minute.\n", "Q: How to get a bug noticed What is the best way to get a critical bug noticed by the right people, so it can be fixed ASAP?\nThere is a bug with GVFS which is preventing developers, like myself, from using IDE's in 10.10. We need to downgrade to 10.04 to use our IDE software. I'd call it a critical bug.\nWe've reported it in these bug reports:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-vfs/+bug/658069\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/geany/+bug/643253\nBut, so far there has been absolutely no official response that I can see. How do I get it seen quickly and fixed?\nI understand patience is always a good idea, but is there anything else that can be done to these bug reports to raise attention to them?\nI am happy to wait, but if there is something we can do to speed up the process, it would be good to know it :)\n\nA: Click the \"affects me\" button at the top of the bug in launchpad. If lots of people do this it indicates that the bug is affected lots of people and may be more important than other bugs.\n\nA: As someone who's been shepherding known, real, important bugs for years now, I can commiserate.\nGetting things fixed really depends on the things, who cares about 'em and how much, and who's paying people money to care in particular directions.\nOpen source is an odd beast.\n-pbr\n\nA: This is not about the particular bugs you've filed, but general good practice for getting bugs dealt with in a timely manner: \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you've filed the bug report in the correct source package. Bug triagers and developers tend to be subscribed to the bug mail of packages they're interested in or responsible from, so for the relevant people to look into your bug in a timely manner, it needs to be filed with a package specified, and the correct one. If you have trouble determining what the right package is, this wiki page may help.\n\n*Make sure your bug contains relevant debugging information. In most cases, filing your report using ubuntu-bug will ensure this, but there's a wealth of information on debugging procedures on the wiki that will also come in handy.\n\n*If your report looks all fine, but there's no response for a long time, try announcing it on #ubuntu-bugs on Freenode by citing the bug number to see if any bug triagers around can push it in the right direction. Remember that most triagers and developers are volunteers with constrained time and energy, and being too assertive can discourage people from helping you. If nobody around seems to be able to help, try another time of the day.\n\n*If you know the particular people whom you think should be looking into your bug, give them a ping on IRC (you can see people's IRC nicknames in their Launchpad profiles), or subscribe them to the bug explaining why you subscribed them with a polite and concise comment immediately afterwards. Don't assign them; just subscribe them, don't subscribe teams unless specifically instructed to do so, and don't mass-subscribe anyone to multiple bugs at the same time.\n\nA: maybe check #ubuntu-bugs on freenode? somebody there is usually willing to help.\n\nA: One more thing: have a go at fixing it yourself!  Many bugs are shallow.  And even if you are not able to get very far, just having a go sends a really strong signal to the developers, and it may draw their attention.  Even if you can't solve it but you can localize the problem a little bit it makes this bug stand out from the mass of other open bugs.\n\nA: Murat's answer is correct for good processes. For your specific bug it seems to be assigned to the wrong component. gnome-vfs is the old unmaintained thing, the current GNOME piece that handles this sort of thing is actually called gvfs.\nYour problem is likely that no one is looking at bugs for something we haven't shipped in a while. Fixing the component and then following Murat's instructions will probably get the attention you need.\n\nA: If all else fails, blog about it on Planet Ubuntu and simply describe the problem in depth.\n", "Q: Wireless Card Behaving Oddly on an HP Pavilion dv6 I'm not sure what kind it is, it doesn't use a propriety driver, it runs out of the box. In 10.04 it worked fine, in 10.10 it'll work, but randomly lose connection, though it won't state it, then it'll work again, and then stop working, very on-and-off behavior. \nThe laptop is an HP Pavilion dv6. \n\nA: Sounds like a problem I had with my Dell laptop, and according to the HP web site it is mostly a Intel based 802.11 ABGN wireless card which my Dell had. \nMy Dell laptop had a problem with it losing connection with a wireless access point using 802.11n. This problem is a known issue with the iwlagn driver, and the best workaround is to disable 802.11n on the card. To disable 802.11n on this card create/edit your /etc/modprobe.d/options.conf file:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/options.conf\n\nAnd add the following to it:\noptions iwlagn 11n_disable=1 11n_disable50=1\n\n\nA: Alternatively, have you considered using an alternative wifi manager? I myself had some problems with nm-applet, but I installed wicd from the repositories, and the problems just disappeared.\nYou can get wicd with sudo apt-get install wicd-gtk, and then restart X.\n\nA: It's an outside chance but have you considered whether external factors may have changed? It might be worth rechecking: signal strength; sources of interference; alternative channel number.\n", "Q: Internal microphone not working I have an internal microphone in my laptop. I think it uses Intel High Definition Audio. But I can't get it to work with Ubuntu. It doesn't work with either the Sound Recorder or Skype.\nOn the Input tab in 'Sound Preferences', I just see Internal Analog Input Device... \n\nA: I know this might sound crazy, but go to the sound preferences, under input, and make sure the check mark for mute is unchecked, it is checked by default....\n\nA: This is what I had to do to get the internal mic to work on my Acer Aspire 5745G:\n\n*\n\n*Install pavucontrol:\nsudo apt install -y pavucontrol\n\n\n\n*Run it with:\npavucontrol\n\nLooks like:\n\nIf it hangs and says:\n\nVolume Control. Establishing Connection to PulseAudio. Please wait...\n\n\nthen you have started it with sudo pavucontrol. Do not use sudo.\n\n*\n\n*Go to the \"Input Devices\" tab\n\n*Click the lock icon to unlock the channels\n\n*Set the right-front channel to silence\n\n\nA: Open a new terminal and run the following commands:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nAdd these two lines to the end of alsa-base.conf:\nalias snd-card-0 snd-hda-intel\noptions snd-hda-intel model=auto\n\nSave and reboot.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and fixed it thus:\nIf you go to the Ubuntu Software Centre and download the Pulse Audio Volume Control or from a terminal type:\nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\nThen just run it with:\npavucontrol\n\nAnd your microphone should show up there. If your microphone shows up but you're still not getting any sound, unlock the channels, and drop one of them down to zero. This worked for me, hope it helps you!\n\nA: Add this line to your /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf file:\noptions snd-hda-intel model=dell-vostro enable=1 index=0\n\n\nA: The solution given above it probably the right thing to do, I've encountered this problem several times at some friends. However, if you can't find it, it might be the case that Ubuntu detected the wrong default audio device. Which happens are various allocations.\nIf this happens, simply open the sounds manager and browse through the devices in the small menu at the top. Just try turn mute off for all of them and then I'm 100% sure that you will figure it out!\n\nA: If you have Fn keys on your keyboard, try enabling the webcam using the Fn keys. in my case the mic and the webcam are disabled and enabled by the same Fn key. I am not sure but you might have a separate Fn key for the mic.\n\nA: In case solutions with pavucontrol did not work for you, try boosting your internal mic from alsamixer in a terminal. By default, it is set to zero, but boosting it resolved my problem.\n\nA: I am running Lenovo Thinkpad with Ubuntu 18.04\nand I'm connected to the lenovo Dock which may have affected the native headphone controls. Both headphone and headphone mic would not work.\nI tried the top answer by Arpit Phillips:\n\n*\n\n*Install Pavucontrol with:\nsudo apt install -y pavucontrol\n\n\n\n*Run Pavucontrol with:\nsudo pavucontrol\n\n\n\n*Go to the \"Input Devices\" Tab\n\n\n*Click the Lock icon to unlock the channels\nand I was able to unmute my headphone there to hear sound, but the mic continued to not work.\nSecondly, I tried the answer by User and oddly it worked in getting my mic working again.\n\n*\n\n*Add this line to your /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf file: options:\nsnd-hda-intel model=dell-vostro enable=1 index=0\n\nI tested my microphone with https://www.onlinemictest.com\n", "Q: Gwibber will not allow me to log into facebook I have installed Ubuntu 10.10 and it does not work, it hasn't worked since the beta I believe, any ideas?

I have allowed port 22 (for SSH) and 80 (if it's a webserver).  My question is that I am trying to enable icmp echo response (ping reply).   \nICMP functions differently than other protocols--I know it is below the IP level in a technical sense.  You can just type sudo ufw allow 22, but you cannot type sudo ufw allow icmp\n\nA: For Ubuntu 18.04, you should have the following rules in your /etc/ufw/before.rules file:\n# ok icmp codes for INPUT\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type destination-unreachable -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type source-quench           -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type time-exceeded           -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type parameter-problem       -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request            -j ACCEPT\n\n# ok icmp code for FORWARD\n-A ufw-before-forward -p icmp --icmp-type destination-unreachable -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-forward -p icmp --icmp-type source-quench           -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-forward -p icmp --icmp-type time-exceeded           -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-forward -p icmp --icmp-type parameter-problem       -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-forward -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request            -j ACCEPT\n\nThese were in my default file.\nOf course, be sure that this is really the problem. My issue was that my computer was blocking pings from getting out to the network where the server I was trying to ping existed.  I ended up using a web site that was already out on the internet to do the ping for me (e.g. https://ping.eu/ping/).\n\nA: Add the following to the /etc/ufw/before.rules file:\n# allow outbound icmp\n-A ufw-before-output -p icmp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-output -p icmp -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n\nAfter editing the file, run the command:\nsudo ufw reload\n\n\nA: ufw does not allow specifying icmp rules via the command line interface command. It does allow you to adjust your ruleset via its rules files, which are iptables-restore style files.\nufw does allow certain icmp traffic by default including icmp echo reply, and this is already configured by default in /etc/ufw/before.rules:\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT\n\nIf your host is not responding to ping, look in this file to make sure the above line is present and if that doesn't work, look at the pinging host and any firewalls between them.\n\nA: It should be noted that, at least in Windows, ping (by default) attempts to communicate via IPv6 and that UFW (by default) blocks that.\nIn order to ping the IPv4 address, use ping -4 <ip.add.re.ss>\n\nA: Here is a help document that discuesses how to enable/disable ping et al responses.\nUFW help\n\nA: If you are still having problems, maybe it is your VirtualBox or VMWare network settings. I often use NAT addressing and so I need to go to Devices/Network/Network Settings... -> Advanced -> Port Forwarding and add a rule to map host to guest ports for port 22.\n", "Q: How to keep \"dot files\" under version control? Etckeeper is a great tool for keeping track of changes to your configuration files in /etc. A few key things about it really stand out. It can be used with a wide variety of VCSs: git, mercurial, darcs, or bzr. It also does auto commits daily and whenever you install, remove or upgrade package. It also keeps track of file permissions and user/group ownership metadata.\nI would also like to keep my \"dot files\" in my home directory under version control as well, preferably bazaar. Does anyone know if a tool like etckeeper exists for this purpose? \nWorst case, I imagine that a simple cron job running bzr add && bzr ci once or twice a day along with adding ~/Documents, ~/Music, etc to the .bzrignore  Anyone already doing something similar with a script?\nWhile I'd prefer bazaar, other options might be interesting.\n\nA: I did not know if there was anything that did this so I whipped up some code to achieve exactly what you want using my repository here: http://github.com/robertmassaioli/config-files\nI have a file that says where all of the files belong and the generate_links program just puts them all there. If you know what you are doing and can compile some Haskell code then it is really simple and easy. Though be warned that it really was made for my own personal use.\n\nA: Well, I went ahead and did this manually until I find a better solution. So I might as well explain what I did.\nFirst I did a bzr init ~, but the next thing I did was bzr ignore \"*\". I decided that I didn't want to keep the entire thing under version control. It just wasn't worth it, especially when you consider that there are some things in there that you really shouldn't keep in vcs like your keys. So I then had to bzr add the specific files I wanted. You can also add exceptions to .bzrignore. Python regular expressions are useful in there as well. I'm keeping it pretty slim for now. If all goes well, I might add all of ~/.config and ~/.gconf too.\nI also wrote a quick script that I run as a cron job. It checks if the files have changed, and if so does an automatic commit:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\nTIME=$(date)\nSTATUS=$(bzr status)\n\nif [ -n \"$STATUS\" ]; then\n    if [ -n \"$1\" ]; then\n         bzr ci ~ -m \"$1\"\n    else\n        bzr ci ~ -m \"Automatic commit on $TIME\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nexit\n\n\nA: I turned my whole ~ directory into a Bazaar repository.  Storing metadata is not an issue for files in the home directory: everything is owned by the same account and group, and bzr already stores the execution bit.\nI manually add the \"interesting\" files to it (I do not want, e.g., my music collection or the firefox cache to be under version control), but if you want to automate this with a script, I think it the simple solution of doing bzr add && bzr ci on selected directories or on the output of a find command will just do the job.\n\nA: I keep my zsh and vim files in git, put on github, in different repositories:\nfor zsh, for example, i created \".zsh\" and put zshrc and zshenv into it, plus a script to link zshrc to ~/.zshrc and zshenv to ~/.zshenv, something like this.\nwhile true\ndo\nread -p \"do you want to link zshenv to ~/.zshenv (Y/N)\" yn\ncase $yn in\n    [Yy]*) ln -s ~/.zsh/zshenv ~/.zshenv; break;;\n    [Nn]*) break;;\n    *) echo \"please answer yes or no\";;\nesac\ndone\n\nwhile true\ndo\nread -p \"do you want to link zshrc to ~/.zshrc (Y/N)\" yn\ncase $yn in\n    [Yy]*) ln -s ~/.zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc; break;;\n    [Nn]*) break;;\n    *) echo \"please answer yes or no\";;\nesac\ndone\n\nso i do\ngit clone git://git@github.com:tshirtman/.zsh\ncd .zsh\n./init.sh\n\nfor .vim, it's almost the same, except i use submodules for plugins, with pathogen, so i added that in the init.sh\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n\nand when i want to add a vim plugin, i do\ngit submodule add git://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides.git bundle/vim-indent-guides\n\nfor example.\nok, it would require a bit too much work if you have more than a few dot dirs you want to manage, but nothing prevent you to put them all in the same dir, or seperated by activities (on for all graphical editors, one for web activities…) or so. anyway, that's what i did, so just my two cents :).\n\nA: I use a solution that isn't automatic like etckeeper (I have to manually commit), but it has worked well for me.  It's not quite as developed as I like, but it works.\nI've wrote my own utility that is similar to GNU Stow, as stow didn't do all that I wanted.  I call it Stow in Home.  When ran, it looks for a directory named \"HOME\".  It then takes everything under that directory and symlinks it to the corresponding location in $HOME, creating directories as necessary.  It also will translate filenames -- if a file starts with a '_', it will be replaced with a '.'.  I did this because it is nicer for editing my dot files when they aren't hidden (see them in directory listings by default).  Then, it would put them in the name their application expects.\nSo, I have several git repositories for my configuration.  I only put dot files that I personally edit in them.  The advantage of this is that I can have a repository for dot files that I can share with others (like my Emacs configuration) and one for others that are private (say, my ssh config, with hostnames and such for work).  The symlinking puts with stow-in-home puts everything in the right place, but the source control for each can be separate.\nIt has worked well for me.  There really is no reason I couldn't set something up to automatically do commits.  Or move all dot files into the appropriate repositories and still use stow in home.  But this is how I've done things.\n\nA: I keep my files in a subdirectory and make symbolic links.  I have a script that automates this.  You can check it all out at http://code.google.com/p/samking-config-files/source/browse/\n\nA: Can't you add the dot files to the repository used in Etckeeper?\n\nA: I've done it by copying all my dotfiles I like to keep under source control to a folder called \"dotfiles\" in my /home/ directory. Of course this means keeping duplicates and copying back and forth when necessary but I find this to be the easiest solution for myself.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of the unsupported packages mentioned during the upgrade from Lucid to Maverick? When upgrading from Lucid to Maverick using the update manager, at one point it lists the packages that are no longer supported (i.e. f-spot). It does not say that it's going to uninstall them. After the upgrade is complete, they are still there. How can I get rid of them?\n\nA: If you want to remove unsupported packages then first list them using ubuntu-support-status --show-unsupported\nthen use sudo apt remove <package-name or names>\nYou will then get rid of unsupported packages\n\nA: In most cases you don't particularly have to remove those packages. That notice only means that those packages are no longer in Ubuntu's main component, and have been demoted to Universe (see this page for more information on components), which means that support for them is still available from the Ubuntu community.\nIf you still want to remove them, you can find out which packages they were by looking at the upgrade log (/var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log) in which you'll find a line that begins with \"demoted:\" containing a list of the packages demoted.\nIf you want to remove packages that are absolutely unused, sudo apt-get autoremove will do that.\n", "Q: How to enable the hdmi sound on a ECS GT240?

I am about to set up box to basically be a file server. I plan on having multiple drives in the box, and would like to set them all up so that they appear to be a single drive. So I could essentially have it mounted at say /media and not really care which drive gets used. I am not sure what the correct terminology for doing this is, so my Google fu is useless in this situation. \nSo how do I set up multiple hard drives to appear as one single drive?\n\nA: Personally I would make sure all drives are (about) the same size, and create a RAID 5 \"array\" from them instead.  The disadvantage of RAID 5 is that you lose the size of one disk in total available diskspace.  The advantage of RAID 5 is that if one of your disks dies, you don't lose a thing, and you can simply replace the broken HDD.\nIf you don't care enough about losing data to spend an extra disk on it, or if you were planning to use a bunch of disks of different sizes you already have, it's probably best to use LVM, as Murat says.\n\nA: I decided to write the step by step directions that I did to set this up. An important note is that I did this on a system where I boot from a separate partition that is not part of the LVM. So the LVM is simply for storage and does not have any of the files needed by the OS to boot. Also this is to create the appearance of one large drive, although a similar technique can be used to create the appearance of multiple drives (well partitions really). It is a very selfish brain dump since the other guides do not all that complete to me. So I hope it can help others.\n\nThese directions are essentially from the link provided by Murat Gunes with some more information I gathered from here.\n\nI started with a disk that I did not have anything on it that I needed.\n\n*\n\n*First you need to create a partition as Linux LVM. You can use fdisk to do this. You can see all the drives Ubuntu sees and how they are listed by running: sudo fdisk -l\nThe first line in each section should give you enough information to identify your drive. It will look like:\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n\nThe part that matters is /dev/sda. Now run: sudo fdisk /dev/sda. You will see:\n\nCommand (m for help):\n\nType p to list the partitions on your drive. You need to delete the partitions that you want to make part of the LVM. So type d to delete. If the drive only has one partition it will remove it (well flag it for removal, it does not happen until we tell it to do it). Otherwise I think (mine only had one) it asks you to enter the number of the one you want to delete.\nNow you need to create the new parition. Type n for new. It asks whether extended or primary. Type p for primary. It asks for partition number, type 1. For first cylinder and last cylinder just leave them blank to use the defaults.\nNow you need to set it to Linux LVM. Type t. It asks for a hex code, use 8e for the Linux LVM. You shoule see something like:\n\nChanged system type of partition 1 to 8e (Linux LVM)\n\nFinally type w to write out the changes to the disk.\n\n*\n\n*Now we need to instal LVM so run sudo apt-get install lvm2 to install it.\n\n*I am gonna be honest and say I am not sure what this step does but the other directions said to do modprobe dm-mod to Load the LVM Module. I did not get any errors so I figure it worked.\n\n*We need to edit the /etc/modules file to this module loads on boot. Do sudo nano /etc/modules to open it up to edit. Add dm-mod to the list of items.  If this file is empty or does not exist, simply add dm-mod as a single line to the file.\n\n*We also want to edit the lvm configuration to update the filter so it does not take to long to scan (I think that is why anyway). So do sudo nano -w /etc/lvm/lvm.conf and change the line with:\n\n\nfilter = [ \"a/.*/\" ]\n\nto be:\n\nfilter = [ \"a|/dev/hd[ab]|\", \"r/.*/\" ]\n\n\n*\n\n*Now we need to set up the first LVM. Do sudo vgscan. You should see something like:\n\n\nReading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...No volume groups found\n\nJust in case there are any volume groups already set up run sudo vgchange -a y to make them available.\n\n*\n\n*Now run sudo pvcreate /dev/sda1 to set up the partition.\n\n*Now run sudo vgcreate media /dev/sda1 replacing media with the name you want the partition to be labeled as.\n\n*Now run sudo lvcreate -l100%FREE -nvolume media replacing volume with the name you want it to be called. This will use all the free space available in the partition.\n\n*Now we need to format the volume so for ext4 you would do sudo mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/media/volume.\n\n*Make the directory you want to mount the volume at. I did sudo mkdir /mnt/media.\n\n*Mount the volume by doing sudo mount /dev/media/volume /mnt/media. Now this is only for this session. When you reboot it will not be remounted automatically. To do that we need to edit /etc/fstab file. To do this add sudo nano /etc/fstab and add the line:\n\n\n/dev/media/volume        /mnt/media       ext4    defaults        0       1\n\nAt this point you could start adding files to the disk, so if you need to clear other disks you want to add you could copy them on here.\n\nAdding another drive to your volume\n\n*\n\n*So follow the steps in the first bullet again but for the new drive.\n\n*Now if the drive name is /dev/sdb1 then do sudo vgextend media /dev/sdb1 to add it to the volume.\n\n*Now we need to unmount the volume. To do this do sudo umount /dev/media/volume.\n\n*Now you can see the stats on your volume now by running sudo vgdisplay. The important part is Free  PE / Size. You need to know how much space you can add to the volume for the next step.\n\n*So if you had 150 Gb of space you would do sudo lvextend -L+150G /dev/media/volume.\n\n*Now run sudo e2fsck -f /dev/media/volume to check the filesystem.\n\n*Now run sudo resize2fs /dev/media/volume to resize everything.\n\n*You can run the stats again and verify that Free PE / Size has dropped to what you expect.\n\n*Remount the volume by doing sudo mount /dev/media/volume /mnt/media\n\n*Rinse and repeat for any other drives.\n\n\nAlso something that I found helpful was I had files I needed to copy off of disks to the LVM I created before I added that disk. So I used `cp -r -v` so that it would recursively copy files and use the verbose output so I know what it was doing. An example of the full command would be:\n\ncp -r -v /mnt/temp/Movies /mnt/shared/media\n\nWhere /mnt/temp/Movies is the folder you want to copy from.\n\nA: You'll probably want to use LVM.

To do so go to /etc/init.d copy skeleton to cpupowerd and insert the values that are stable for you.

(Probably a silly question, I know because I don't NEED the 64 bit edition, but I'm hearing if I want to utilize all the available RAM I can't be content with the 32.) But I can't shake the sneaking suspicion that I'm overlooking something important.\n\nA: amd64 is a description of the chip architecture, like x86 (or i386) was for 32-bit architectures. AMD developed and released 64-bit chips before intel, and iirc, intel actually liscensed the AMD technology to use in their chips.\nIn short, this is the correct version for your 64-bit machine.\n\nA: Nothing to worry about. Is just because AMD was the first to build processor with 64bit architecture, hence the name amd64. It is the correct version for 64bit Intel processors too.\n", "Q: What are the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit, and which should I choose? What is the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit Ubuntu? I've heard the 64-bit platform performs better and can detect more than 4GB of RAM. Also, while some apps haven't ported to 64-bit yet, ia32-libs lets a 64-bit machine run them.\nIf so, why not promote 64-bit over 32-bit?\n\nA: I looked into this for Ubuntu Precise LTS a while back.  Here are some results of some analysis I ran:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/power-benchmarking/blueprint-foundations-p-64bit-by-default/low-memory-systems/readme.txt\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/power-benchmarking/blueprint-foundations-p-64bit-by-default/hpmini-and-x220-tests/results-3/results.txt\nBasically, if you have 4GB or less is OK, for more than 4GB consider using i386-pae or amd64.  64 bit systems consume more memory (for example, pointers are 64 bit in size) but you may see a performance win on 64 bit systems because of optimisations that use 64 bit copies or use the extra CPU registers that are available in 64 bit mode.\n\nA: For me the most important was the fact that You can not use ZFS filesystem on 32bit os, because it is simply unstable there due to vmalloc limits of 32bit os (regardless of PAE or nonPAE). That was a reason for me to reinstall to 64bit, and I never looked back.\nEven NVIDIA has few lines about vmalloc thing in \"troubleshooting\" pages, ending by encouraging users to switch to 64bit kernels.\nThere is an adressing limit of 1GB in 32bit mode, so even if it can use up to 4GB, only 1GB is so called \"low\" and the rest is \"high memory\" which is not that general. And 1GB is really small number, nowadays..\nTry #free -l\n\nA: If you don't care to learn the technical details, select the recommended 32-bit version.\n64-bit is generally faster, even if objectively hard to notice. This is has less to do with the 64-bit data width, but with the availability of 16 over 8 common CPU registers on the whole instruction set. The disadvantage of wasting more memory for management and larger pointers is thereby mostly levelled out.\nThe practical problem: not everyone has a AMD64 compatible CPU. Promoting 64-bit over the standard i686 version would lead to more user frustration. Therefore for the next few years, it's less confusing to present the 32-bit version to the average user. It's not exactly a problem for anyone in the know, since the 64-bit version is readily available. And we amd64 users don't have any disadvantage from that situation, except for the initial download. All packages are available in both architectures.\nUnder the circumstances the Ubuntu download page looks okay to me. It says \"32 bit (recommended)\", but that \"recommended\" translates to \"fewer issues, if you don't know all the technical details of your computer\". For the netbook edition download page, there isn't even the choice, because some Intel atom CPUs are 32-bit only even in 2010!\nSo in conclusion, I think eschewing the compatibility problems is still necessary. However, I agree that there should be at least a shiny footnote along the lines that -64 is faster than -32, and recommended IF (BUT ONLY IF) the target system supports it.\n\nA: As stated by previous posters, 64-bit vs 32-bit refers to the size of data which can be moved in one operation by the computer. This relates to the size of the registers on the CPU and the width of the busses (a register is just holds data for the CPU to operate on, they used to be tiny in consumer hardware and have been growing since the inception of home computing. Busses connect different parts of a motherboard together, they are the highway on which the data flows around).\nThe issue is that most OSes had some real issues when moving over to 64-bit operations, with poor support for drivers and applications. Often applications actually had worse performance in early versions. Given that there is no real reason for most people to jump in the deep end, the Linux powers-that-be seem to be taking the move a little slower than cough _other_ OSes, slow but steady.\n\nA: For plain user experience official Ubuntu site suggests 32-bit versions due to more flexible tuning.\nI count here also means the data consistence.\nThere are exists a very many points for any pro and contra.\nMy view is a great performance of 64-bit OS on Intel Architecture 64-bit processor directly related to using 64-bit software and drivers, that can give you the chance to beat regular 32-bit performance.\nNote that using of 32-bit software on 64-bit OS sometimes can cause a bad performance and even overheating in very different cases.\nHowever, by your signed components and this reference:\nIntel® Extended Memory 64 Technology: 64-Bit Desktop Computing\n... better experience possible with 4Gb+ of memory.\nI count this will good and not very expensive solution for you.\nAnd yeah, using both systems in parallel able to bring you more clear understanding your configuration and versatility in the meanings.\n\nA: Basically I would say use 64 bit version if you need it.\nIf you are mainly browsing the web, watching youtube, hang around on facebook, watch films etc. then 32 bit is better because you don't need any good hardware to do those things.\nIf you play games on Steam, WINE etc., run loads of programs, do some media editing and such then 64 bit is best choice.\nso casual use then 32 bit OS, Advanced use then 64 bit version.\n\nA: \nThe terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's CPU handles\n  information. The 64-bit version handles large amounts of RAM more\n  effectively than a 32-bit system. 1\n\n\n\n*\n\n*To run a 64-bit OS you need support from the 64-bit CPU.\n\n\n*\n\n*To run a 64-bit application you need support from both the 64-bit OS \nand the 64-bit CPU.\n\n\n\nThe general rule is that 32-bit (OS and Application) will run on 64-bit, but 64-bit (OS and Application) does not run on 32-bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*A 32-bit OS will run on a 32-bit or 64-bit processor without any\nproblem.\n\n*A 32-bit application will run on a 32-bit or 64-bit OS without any\nproblem.\n\n*But a 64-bit application will only run on a 64-bit OS and a 64-bit OS\nwill only run on a 64-bit processor.\n\n\nA 64-bit compatible CPU is needed to install a 64-bit OS. Check with the manufacturer of your PC to find out if your system is 64-bit compatible.\n32-bit systems have a 4 Gigabyte RAM memory limit, which means they cannot address more than 4GB of RAM even if more is installed on the system (Not all of it will be used). Workarounds are available, but hard to do for an average user.\nNote: Ubuntu 12.10, and newer will support PAE automatically.  Prior to 12.10, you have the option to choose PAE support depending on your CPU. PAE extends maximum RAM on 32-bit to 64GB, more inforamtion can be found here.\n64-bit editions have additional advantages, including an increased bandwidth, hardware enabled DEP (data execution prevention) and better Kernel protection.\nThe majority of 32-bit applications will continue to work on a 64-bit systems, but some applications do not work at all, or will run slower.\nFor more information you can look at 32-bit and 64-bit \n1Source: Microsoft\n\nA: I believe the main question when choosing between 32 and 64 bits is not \"Does my processor support 64 bits — if so then I should use 64 because that's twice as good\", but \"How much memory do I have?\".\n64-bit programs use about 50% more memory then their 32-bit counterparts. The results of this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*less code/data can fit into processor caches -> more cache misses -> your super-fast processor waits more for memory controller to fetch data from RAM. Processor also needs to read more data because it's more bloated.\n\n*Linux uses non-allocated RAM to cache disks. Less free memory available -> less space for disk caches -> slower disk access\n\n*Once you're out of RAM and the system starts swapping - disk access is thousands times slower than RAM, so any potential benefits of 64-bit code (see below) are flying out of window.\nOn the other hand, in 64-bit mode processor has more registers, so it doesn't need to access memory that often, also, some calculations (64-bit numbers etc.) are more efficient. So generally, code which is not memory-restricted runs slightly faster in 64-bit mode.\nSo, if your system has, say, 2GiB of RAM or less then I would definitely choose 32 bits. More than 4GiB - the benefits of 64 bits are becoming more prominent. Around 4GiB is a \"grey zone\" - you need to make a choice yourself. \nHere are screenshots of a (rather old) vanilla Ubuntu running in a VirtualBox with 1GiB RAM:\n32 bit: uses 388 MiB of RAM right after booting, no additional applications running (from the screenshot, 397780KiB, which is 388MiB)\n\n64 bit: uses 491 MiB of RAM (from the screenshot, 503452KiB = 491MiB)\n\nAdditionally, in my testing, a web-application written in Python used up to 60% more memory on a 64-bit machine which resulted in a test suite running in 380 secs on a 32-bit machine but taking 523 seconds on a 64-bit one (both with 1GiB of RAM). If the machines were not RAM-limited the results would likely be different (as phoronix tests show).\nHere are some more thorough and recent tests: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/x32/Quantal-x32-power-memory-comparisons.ods\n\n\n\nBasically, it's like giving up 30% of your RAM in exchange of possible gain of 10% CPU speed.\n\nA: As pointed here in Phoronix: \"With the Ubuntu multi-arch situation being cleared up, most applications and plug-ins now working fine on 64-bit (such as Adobe Flash and Java), and 64-bit being usually much faster than 32-bit, there really is no big reason not to move to the x86_64 version.\"   \nAlthough it is discussed if 64bit will be indicated as the default instead of 32bit, I think you have some performance gain with the first. See these benchmarks.  \nAnd a word of your \"low\" RAM memory from Phoronix: \"[S]ome Ubuntu developers have been overly concerned about 32-bit netbooks being out there still and for systems that only have 2GB of RAM where using x86_64 software may lead to running low on memory and thus increased SWAP usage. However, for a far majority of users, they're much better off in a 64-bit world.\"  \nMaybe you can install it and watch if the system uses the swap often.  \n\nA: 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the size (or width) of a chunk of memory or more accurately, the memory registers in a computer's CPU - this defines how much data the processor can handle in a single operation. 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the size (or width) of a chunk of memory or more accurately, the memory registers in a computer's CPU - this defines how much data the processor can handle in a single operation. Yes, that means that the 64-bit version is going to operate faster since it can handle more data at one.\n\nA: To be honest, I haven't perceived any difference except from slightly reduced time required to compile programs and to encode video. Other than that, it feels the same to me. I have noticed tho,  that what really makes a difference in terms of performance is the video driver. I guess the 32bit video drivers are better supported. I recently installed the latest nVidia 260 driver on a 32bit system and it made a LOT of difference. I'm currently using 32bit.\n\nA: I use Ub64 in a AMD64 chip, I can feel the speed diference. It's not a big boost, but you can feel. Why won't you give a try for 10 secs to each one, and compare by yourself, on your own system (which is the point of the question)? I'm sure you will be not losing your time, since installation is so fast this days. (tks Ubuntu!-)\nThe Java/Flash issues have \"good\" workarounds around the net too...\n\nA: Personally on my desktop I'm running 64 bit because it supports more then 4gb of ram. You also get a speed boost. I know that you can also optimize 32 bit to be able to detect 4gb of ram or more. About your second question 32bit is name i386 because intel was the ones that deveolop the 32bit instruction/technology and AMD follow. AMD then develop the 64 bit and then Intel catch up or adopted that technology. That's why 64bit is Amd64.\n\nA: Like squallbayu I was hoping the 64 bit would work better since I had just purchased a 17\" Macbook Pro intel i-7 8 Gig RAM 500 Gig hard drive latest Lion OS in the spring of 2011. Unfortunately after installing both 64 first and then 32 bit  hands down the 32 bit was more stable and smooth.. I didnt knotice anything to do with speed (minimal difference)\nAs I am not an expert but I really think that the benefit of 64-bit will not be noticed until software developers learn how to harness its power..\n\nA: Apart from the differences excellently stated by the other community members, if you are concerned about RAM, you can always install zRAM.\nWikipedia info on zRAM:\n\nzRam is an experimental (staging) module of the Linux kernel. It was previously called \"compcache\". zRam increases performance by avoiding paging on disk and instead uses a compressed block device in RAM in which paging takes place until it is necessary to use the swap space on the hard disk drive. Since using RAM is faster than using disks, zRam allows Linux to make more use of RAM when swapping/paging is required, especially on older computers with less RAM installed.\nEven though the cost of RAM hardware is relatively low this feature still offers advantages for netbooks and other lower-powered laptops, virtualization and in the case of embedded devices, especially those that use flash memories that have a limited lifespan, dependent on write-use and thus wear out quickly when used as a swap device.\n\n\nA: The difference between 32 bit and 64 bit has not changed since this question was posed.\nI would suggest to use the 64 bit version.\nI don't know a software which can't be used on an 64 bit system and if you want to use 4 GB (or more) of RAM you need to use the 64 bit version of ubuntu.\n\nA: Apart from being able to address more memory and possible speed improvements, you should download and install the 64-Bit version for your new UEFI capable machine that comes with Windows 8 or a newer version of Windows.\nWhile 32-Bit support for UEFI systems is being worked on, there are currently no standard 32-Bit images available that boot in UEFI mode.\n", "Q: How do I control the position of an indicator created with appindicator.Indicator? I've created a simple indicator in python using the appindicator module.  However, it always shows up to the left of the existing indicators.  Is there some way to control what position the indicators appears in?\nFor example, it currently displays like so...\nmy indicator, volume indicator, messaging indicator\nbut I want...\nvolume indicator, messaging indicator, my indicator\n\nA: The previous answer is correct in saying that the layout is like this:\n  [appmenu]        [app indicators] [system indicators]\n\nWhich means you can not have the layout you mention in the question.  But, you CAN move an Application Indicator within the space allocated for the application indicators.  You do that by calling app_indicator_set_ordering_index() to a custom value.  The value is normally generated by the application name and category, but if you want to be next to another indicator you can grab it's value and add (or subtract) one so that you are close.\n\nA: It's the indicator applet's default to group application and system indicators separately, and place application indicators to the left of system indicators, so you'd probably need a modified host applet to do that.\nSee the specification for further information, and you can also ask for help in #ayatana on Freenode.\n", "Q: Using 'quota' for disk limits I installed quota using apt-get and followed some of the tutorials online. \nI ran sudo edquota username which opened nano and gave a chart for me to edit.

I wonder, why Kubuntu team does not use Kubuntu Icon in KDE Start menu just like Ubuntu?\n\nA: One of the principles of the Kubuntu Team is to keep the KDE desktop on Kubuntu as close to the default KDE desktop as possible. Changing such icons would violate this principle. \nHowever, since all is open source software, anybody can customize their own desktop anyway they like.\n\nA: I believe the Kubuntu team likes to keep KDE fairly.. KDE. I believe there is an icon somewhere it is just not enabled by default.\n\nA: To quote Jonathan Riddell:\n\nI'm very happy with the upstream KDE artwork and don't see any reason to change it\n\nSince Riddell and other members of the Kubuntu community are happy with the artwork KDE ships, they prefer to stick with it instead of customizing it for Kubuntu. They encourage people interested in working on the artwork to do so upstream with KDE so that other distributions (including Kubuntu) can benefit from the work.\n\nA: I have the elementary theme and an 'e' instead of the KDE icon. From Kubuntu's stand point keep true to KDE, but from yours change it to suit yourself.

I would like to change this script so that it deletes the original rar archives from /rared only if they successfully extracted. \nThis does not mean that unrar has reported that they have been fully extracted, because I have had data corruption during decompression before.\nIdeally (pie-in-the-sky, just to give you an idea of what I'm shooting for,) the unrar program would include this functionality, comparing an expected md5sum value with the actual md5sum value and only deleting the archive if they match. I don't mind scripting this entire process if I have to, but there must be a better way than unraring twice and comparing md5sums.\n\nA: A friend of mine has been working on a bash shell script to do this which is on github here.\nhttps://github.com/arfoll/unrarall\n\nA: This is the script I have so far, it first checks if there is a current unrar operation running, and exits if there is (don't want to swamp the disk with heaps of read/writes). It then unRARs all files in /rared which have not already been unRARed, placing extracted files in /unrared. It does not yet check the extracted files or delete the archives:\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# First check if there is an \"unrar\" running already, if so, exit.\n\nif ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep -v unrarall | grep unrar ; then\n        exit 0\nelse\n\n# This line probably unnecessary\nPATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/\n\n# The RARs I download are always multi-part, so I have to find the\n#   first file in the archive and extract only that.

Install this driver (it has 3D support), then restart and see if Unity works. If that does not work, then you are out of luck. GMA500 is a crappy little chipset.\n\nA: The GMA500 (codename: Poulsbo) chipset is the main Intel graphics card without open-source drivers¹.  As such, we can't support them on the LiveCD, and these drivers are consistently problematic and are hence not available in the official Ubuntu archives.\nSadly your card has poor Linux support.

By default Ubuntu uses DHCP and Gnome NetworkManger to configure interfaces. This is not optimal in many cases.\nHow to configure a desktop machine for a static IP address that applies to all users?\nAdditional background: For 99.9% of users a static DHCP entry is probably the easiest solution, however I have found a conflict with mythtv-background process and any changes to the eth0 interface. If the interface is brought up/down after mythtv is running, it hangs the process (which also broke system suspend). So my questions really needs a static IP address, where the interface is brought up with a known IP, and stays up permanently.\n\nA: Update /etc/networking/interfacesto set the static address:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.0.10\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.0.1\n\nSet one or more desired nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf:\nnameserver 192.168.0.1\n\nYou must prevent gnome-network-manager from attempting to hijack the eth0 connection:\nsudo apt-get remove network-manager network-manager-gnome\n\nAssign static IP address by restarting the networking sub-system:\nsudo invoke-rc.d networking restart\n\n\nA: Right click nm, choose Edit connections... find your interface, click Edit..., click IPv4 Settings, choose Manual and configure your interface.\n\nAn alternative would be to edit /etc/network/interfaces. an example configuration would be:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n   address 192.168.1.1\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n\nthen run\n/etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nKeep in mind that this will deactivate nm for this interface and you will have to delete (or uncomment) the entries to activate nm again.\nEdit (see Casey's post):\nYou also have to set a DNS after editing /etc/network/interfaces:\n\nSet one or more desired nameserver in\n  /etc/resolv.conf:\nnameserver 192.168.1.1\n\n\nA: If you have a little router logged into it, (something like http://192.168.1.1 from you browser), record current DNS server addresses.

I'd tell you what I do but this is running on my phone and the client is different.\n\nA: There is two part in your question :\n\n\n*\n\n*You should have vnc running on your computer.\n\n*You should create a tunnel that allow you to access it.\n\n\nIt's easier if you can test on the network where the machine is installed.\nStarting vnc\nRegarding the first part, I personally use vino.  There is a quick setup guide for vino.\nInstall vino:\nsudo apt-get install vino\n\nConfigure vino:\nvino-preferences\n\nBy default, it open this windows :\n\nIf you can redirect your display, you can make that windows pop on another computer.  If not, you'll need to check the vino man page to find out how to make the same configuration .\nYou start the server with :\n/usr/lib/vino/vino-server\n\nOnce you connected to your VNC, I suggest you enter this command in your Autostarted Apps to start vino server.\nThere several tool out there.  I used vino because it is the simplest to use (in my knowledge).\nTunnel\nRegarding the second part of the question.  The local port is what ever you feel like.  By convention, we try to make the local and remote port the same.  You will need to specify the port if you use something different.\nThe remote port is where your server is running.  If you are using vino, it's localhost:5900 (unless you configure something else).\n\nA: I find x11vnc very nice and easy to get quickly started. Just took 3 steps to get it installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install x11vnc:\n$ sudo apt-get install x11vnc\n\n\n*Run x11vnc:\n$ x11vnc\n...\nThe VNC desktop is:      sun:0\nPORT=5900\n\n\n*From another box VNC to this above box.\n", "Q: Why can't I restart/shutdown? When I shutdown/restart  get a black (shell-like) full-screen with some large text saying stuff like:\nubuntu 10.10 [129.171175] Restarting system. eco\nnds ... [OK]\n...\nUnmounting weak filesystems ... [OK]\nwill now restart\n\nThen nothing happens and I have to physically hit the reset button.\n\nA: Sometimes the restart doesn't quite work properly. For example, when using Ubuntu on Apple computers, you must add reboot=pci to your boot flags to reboot properly, without hanging on the reboot message like your computer is. I'm not saying that your computer is Apple, but that boot flag may help.\n\nA: You can try the method is this link, which is,\nadded:\nacpi=force reboot=acpi\n\ninto: \n/etc/default/grub\n\nThe final code looks like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet acpi=force reboot=acpi\"\n\nPlease let me know whether it would solve your problem.\n\nA: In addition to what Delan suggested, in general you should certainly try different values for the reboot= boot parameter; I'd suggest reboot=b in particular, since that's the most common one for machines to need.  Here's the comment from linux/arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c with the possible values:\n/* reboot=b[ios] | s[mp] | t[riple] | k[bd] | e[fi] [, [w]arm | [c]old] | p[ci]\n   warm   Don't set the cold reboot flag\n   cold   Set the cold reboot flag\n   bios   Reboot by jumping through the BIOS (only for X86_32)\n   smp    Reboot by executing reset on BSP or other CPU (only for X86_32)\n   triple Force a triple fault (init)\n   kbd    Use the keyboard controller. cold reset (default)\n   acpi   Use the RESET_REG in the FADT\n   efi    Use efi reset_system runtime service\n   pci    Use the so-called \"PCI reset register\", CF9\n   force  Avoid anything that could hang.\n */\n\nThe kernel has a number of so-called \"quirks\" for particular machines that require the BIOS reboot method, but like any hardware quirks database the chances are that it's missing a few.  Your computer may be one of the ones that's missing.  If you find that reboot=b consistently fixes this for you, then please run 'ubuntu-bug linux' to report a kernel bug asking for this to be made the default for your machine.\nYou can make this change either on the GRUB command line (hit 'e' on the relevant boot entry and go to the end of the linux line), or, to make it permanent, edit /etc/default/grub and change the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX line, being careful to put reboot=b (or whatever) inside the quote marks.\n", "Q: Tweaking Login Screen Are there any applications similar to Login Screen GDM2?\nIt's only supported till Ubuntu Lucid, is the Splash Screen after login available for MavericK?\n\nA: Yep, Ubuntu-tweak can help you with that.\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nOnce installed it will be in Applications->System Tools. You'll be able to tweak many things of your Ubuntu including GDM.\nA picture is worth a thousand words :\n\n\nA: Afaik since 9.10 only gdm group can change appearance  properties.

I don't know if you'll have to restart.\n\nA: In case anybody still cares about this:  a way to set the theme used at login time is to configure the login environment such that it runs the Gnome \"appearance properties\" application when gdm starts up.  To do this, you just have to copy a \".desktop\" file into the \"LoginWindow\" autostart directory:\ncd /usr/share/applications\nsudo cp gnome-appearance-properties.desktop ../gdm/autostart/LoginWindow\n\nNext time you get to the login screen, you'll get the appearance dialog first.  After you've set it up the way you like it, you can get rid of the file:\nsudo rm /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow/gnome-appearance-properties.desktop\n\n\nA: There is a project to create an utility to tweak GDM2, its called GDM2Setup. But \nlast time I tested it, it was not stable and don't permitted anything more than what \nUbuntu Tweak permit today. But maybe they have add features since then, but I can't \ntest it because there is no PPA for Maverick.\nIf you have Lucid or Hardy :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gdm2setup/gdm2setup\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python-gdm2setup\n\n", "Q: Server on Atom D410? I am new to ubuntu (I am old time windows user and now want to shift my box).\nI want to setup my new dev box. I have selected following config for the PC\n\n\n*\n\n*Processes - Atom D410, 1.6 Ghz, (512K cache) \n\n*RAM - 2 GB (667Mhz FSB)\n\n*HDD - 250 GB (7200 rpm)\n\n\nIs that ok to run Ubuntu server or should I go for bigger box?\n\nA: I run a whole Ubuntu media centre complete with Boxee on a machine with less power than that (using an Atom N270 which is a lot less powerful than the D410). It does have a graphics card to help with the video decoding but that doesn't lift all the weight off the CPU.\nYou can actually rent dedicated hosting servers that use the D410. This little CPU is up to the task... Just be aware that it's (obviously) not going to be as fast as a \"real\" server or desktop processor.\nUbuntu Server will do just fine.\n\nA: That hardware is more than fast enough for web development.  People run websites with actual users in VPS instances that have a lot less memory & CPU power...\nI remember 10 years ago we ran 4 or 5 active websites (including a for that time fairly active web forum) on a Pentium 100 MHz machine with 64 MiB RAM.  And that machine was running websites that used Perl, PHP and ColdFusion.  And also ran a MySQL database of course.  And yes, it was still \"fast enough\".\nOf course applications have grown a bit bigger nowadays (mostly because they have more features), but they shouldn't require 20x more processing power or 10x more memory.\nLet's put it like this: if it's slow on this Atom machine, it won't be able to handle a lot of requests on a much bigger machine either.  So if it's slow, you need to optimize your web application, not buy bigger hardware.\n\nA: I have a Ubuntu 10.4 Server on a Atom 330 running\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache\n\n*Deluge\n\n*NFS\n\n*Samba\n\n*MySql\n\n*SSH\n\n*Raid 10 (system)\n\n*LVM (data, 4 Partitions)\n\n\nWhat i found out is, that data transfers are critical (maybe it's because of the software raid):\nSpeed NFS: 30-60MB/s (non-encrypted FS)\nSpeed Local encrypted FS: 15MB/s\nSpeed SFTP: 4MB/s\n\nIt's normal for SFTP to be slower than normal copy, but 4MB is SLOW!\n\nWebservices run ok, Mediawiki reacts quite fast. Same with deluge.\nI set up a minecraft server, it worked, but it made the Computer really slow so I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nA: It'll run, but it may not run fast! I run Ubuntu server on a EEE 701. It takes a couple of seconds to process a login, and I wouldn't want to be running a database server with any real amount of data on it, but it'll work as a cheap dev box.\n", "Q: Backup mysql from terminal I have scheduled a cron job to backup mysql databases on ubuntu9.10. I used the following entries in the cron file.\n37 4 * * * root /usr/bin/mysqldump -u root -p<mysql-password> --all-databases > /usr/backup/mysqlbkup/all-databases.sql\n\nIt backs up all the databases puts in a single file called 'all-databases.sql'. This is what I wanted. But if I want to restore a single database I will have to restore all the databases. Is there any trick to backup all mysql databases to a directory with their database name individually?.\n\nA: Yes there is.\nFor those who have multiple databases lets say 50 - 100, entering it one after the other will be pain staking\nYou will have to create a bash/shell file i.e file with \".sh\" extension, after which you will make it executable by changing it mod\nchmod 777 <file_name>.sh\n\nthen enter your code above with this few alterations;\nwhat we are doing here is query mysql for the list of database(s) and puting the output in a loop for each turn\ndatabase=`mysql --user=<enter username> --password=<enter password> -e \"SHOW DATABASES\"`\nfor db in $database; do\n    echo \"$db\"\n    mysqldump --user=\"<enter username>\" --password=\"<enter password>\" --databases \"$db\" > <path_to_store_your_database>/\"$db\".sql\n    gzip \"$db\"\ndone\n\nFinally you will add the file to crontab and shedule the backup time. You can also run the command manually by typing:\nbash <name of the file>.sh\n\nor\nsh <name of the file>.sh\n\n\nA: I suggest you read: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysqldump.html\nYou can dump different databases with: mysqldump [options] --databases DB1 [DB2 DB3...]\nYou just have to add a cronjob for each database:\n37 4 * * * root /usr/bin/mysqldump -u root -p<mysql-password> --databases database1 > /usr/backup/mysqlbkup/databases1.sql\n38 4 * * * root /usr/bin/mysqldump -u root -p<mysql-password> --databases database2  database3 > /usr/backup/mysqlbkup/databases2_3.sql\n\nOfcourse you could make one bash script for all different databases and run that script from the crontab.

How to change the screen resolution?\nI tried with this command:\nrdesktop <server_ip>\n\nBut the screen does not appear large.\n\nA: I'd suggest that you consider a graphical tool such as Remmina (used to be called GRDC), which is available in the repositories.\nsudo apt-get install remmina remmina-plugin-rdp remmina-plugin-vnc\n\nIt features easy to use drop downs and sliders for remote screen resolution, supporting multiple monitors and more.\nIt also supports VNC and SSH tunnelling, making it a one-stop-shop for all your most likely remote desktop connection needs.  Finally, a handy gnome-panel applet makes connecting to your remote desktops a simple point and click experience.\nScreenshots here : http://remmina.sourceforge.net/screenshots.shtml\n\nA: I like using this command:\nrdesktop -g 90% servername\n\nWhich will set the size of the remote desktop to 90% of the size of your local screen, which works quite well regardless of resolution.\n\nA: If you want to open the screen at a specific resolution, for example 1280×1024 resolution, add the -g flag:\nrdesktop -g 1280x1024 <server_ip>\n\n\nA: I had the problem on my Ubuntu 20.10 notebook that my screen has 1920x1080 but only 14 inch, so the dpi is higher on my notebook screen than on the monitor of the remote computer\nI could adjust this by using -g parameter with the DPI option, that is specified via an @ sign.\nrdesktop -g 100%@150 <remote_computer>\n\nThe 100% refer to my screen size and the higher the value after the 1\n\nA: This command gives you a full screen experience as well:\nrdesktop -f\n\n\nA: I found the answer to my question.\n\n*\n\n*-k de: set keyboard layout\n\n*-g 1500x1150: set resolution of the rdesktop window\n\n*-r disk:mydisk=/home/soma: share your home directory with the remote machine\n\nThe full command should be:\nrdesktop 192.168.1.23 -k de -g 1500x1150 -r disk:mydisk=/home/soma \n\n\nA: Use the @DPI scaling option.

Actually, it doesn't display anything but a blank window where the touches show show up. I was expecting something like in this Screenshot.\nAny ideas where I went wrong or what I didn't correctly understand? :-)\n\nA: Since you've configured your MT to use the synaptics driver, it's working in a kind of \"touchpad emulation\" mode. My understanding is that the true multitouch and gesture functionality requires the evdev driver, which unfortunately doesn't provide the same basic pointing functions (two-finger scrolling, two and three-finger taps) with the MT at the moment. So for this release, true multitouch gestures and basic pointing functions are mutually exclusive, and we're resorting to synaptics as a temporary measure until evdev catches up.\nYou can follow multitouch-related happenings by joining the multi-touch-dev mailing list, or visiting the #ubuntu-touch channel on Freenode. \n\nA: Please see this to get help and see other resources about MultiTouch in Ubuntu: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch#Community%20Help\nThere is a detailed guide there for using the Apple MT in Ubuntu, including the PyMT demo wiki - which I have since updated.\n", "Q: Start / stop init.d script without root access I am setting up an ubuntu-server in order to host the virtuoso server.\nI want to setup a simple user (without sudo) account that will (only) be able to run\n/etc/init.d/virtuoso-opensource-6.1   [start|stop|restart]\n(to be able to administer the virtuoso server, but not other system resources)\ni guess this is similar/equivalent to any service e.g. apache2, mysql, etc\nis there an option to limit access to only the virtuoso service, or an option to access to all the init.d scripts, but not the rest of the system?\n\nA: Your question seems to assume that sudo is an all or nothing grant of root privilege because that is how it is often used.\nWith configuration you can arrange for very tight control over what sudoers can and can't do.\n\nA: You can customize which commands the user can run via sudo in /etc/sudoers (using visudo):\nusername: ALL = /etc/init.d/virtuoso \n\n", "Q: How to configure Ubuntu 10.x to use a different window manager?

I'm considering switching to either Fluxbox or Blackbox as my window manager, but I'm not really sure which one to go with. \nAre there any major differences between the two ?\n\nA: The most important difference is probably that Fluxbox is still actively developed, while Blackbox's last cvs commit seems to have been in 2005.\nAnother important difference is that Fluxbox has various features that Blackbox does not - most notably:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use tabs to group multiple windows together\n\n*Fluxbox has a system tray/notification area\n\n*Fluxbox supports key bindings out of the box while blackbox requires a separate tool (taken from The Alpha Nerd's answer)\n\n\nA: Also, Blackbox needs a bbkeys program for keyboard shortcuts, while flux has them integrated.

Sometimes it will skip to track 2 or 3 as well (shuffle is not on).\nHow do I get Banshee to just play an album or a play queue then STOP?\n\nA: I think the behaviour described by the OP is caused by the gapless playback option. Disabling that option stops this very annoying glitch.\nI appreciate this is an old question, but people may still find it while googling for this problem, as I did.\n\nA: I have the same problem. I haven't found a fix and I'm pretty sure I logged a bug against this over a year ago (no idea where it is now).\nHowever I have found a workaround. I call it that (rather than a fix) because it's a pain in the bottom.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart Banshee\n\n*Empty the Play Queue (Right click it, click clear)\n\n*Double click the Play Queue\n\n*Add tracks to the Queue\n\n*Double click the Play Queue again to start playing.\n\n\nI also assume you queue's fill mode is manual and it's not pulling in songs automatically. If you're not using manual mode, that might be your problem.\nIf you find a way of doing this without restarting Banshee, let me know... Not that I mind restarting Banshee... If it's running for too long it does tend to eat all my RAM.\n\nJust noticed the other half to your question. If you have things in Play Queue they are supposed to play after the current track. That's by design. If you don't want them to play, clear the queue.\n", "Q: Why does pasting sometimes not work in gnome-terminal? Ctrl + Shift + C and Ctrl + Shift + V are supposed to replace the normal Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V in gnome-terminal. \nSometimes they work, but usually they have no effect. What are some potential reasons for this? I'm not sure what other information to give.\nEdit: It seems that manually selecting Paste from the Edit menu does not work either. Right click > Paste works, but Edit > Paste does not. Copying works, but pasting does not.\nAlso, I have vi-mode enabled (set -o vi in my ~/.bashrc). Could this have something to do with it?\nEdit: Here is a video demonstrating the problem. I used Screenkey (in \"raw\" mode, to catch \"shift\") to show what keys I am pressing.\n\nA: It has to do, as you suspect, with \"vi\" mode.\n\"vi\" mode has separate insert and command modes, as you know. When in command mode, all text sent to the terminal is interpreted as a command.\nTo convice yourself do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy somewhere a string containing \"isometext\"\n\n*go to the terminal and press ESC to go to command mode\n\n*paste\n\n\nyou should see only \"sometext\", because the initial \"i\" has been interpreted as the insert command.\nSolution: if in command mode, press \"i\" before inserting.\nIf not sure, press ESC and \"i\" before inserting.\n\nA: Using the terminal copy and paste utilizes two different methods based on which way you perform the copy and paste.  If you use the highlight and paste-with-third-button, you are utilizing one of the buffers in X to do the work. If you use the menu or right-click to copy and paste, you are utilizing a different buffer.\nThus, if you copy with a selection from the menu, then you must either paste using the menu or use the right-click menu. You can't select using Edit > Copy and then use the third mouse button to paste.\nThis is also the reason you can't copy by highlighting then going to another application and using Edit > Paste.\n\nA: This is a bug in gnome-terminal, the bug report is here with a patch:\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=600876\nGnome has not fixed the problem though.\nUbuntu has fixed it independently of Gnome. The detailed bug report is here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-terminal/+bug/630383\nAccording to the bug report, the fixed Ubuntu package is gnome-terminal version 2.32.1-0ubuntu3. It is currently in the upload queue of maverick-proposed repository (with unapproved status). The upload queue is here:\nhttp://launchpad.net/ubuntu/maverick/+queue\nYou could download the source package and build it yourself with debuild.\nHopefully it will be soon pushed to normal update repositories.\n\nA: try shift-ctrl-v (same buttons, different order). You can also reassign your keyboard shortcuts under terminal Edit menu.\nDo not reassign it to Ctrl+C, because Ctrl+C is used for killing processes under terminal (well, sending TERM signal).\n\nA: For me, the easiest way to paste is the middle mouse button click. However I still copy using the menu, because I don't need to copy often.\n\nA: For the record, I've run this test on various virtual instances of stock installs, ranging from 9.04 all the way through 11.04 Alpha 3.  I've been unable to replicate your issues.\nI believe that the issue may be some type of configuration somewhere conflicting with another.  As to the specific configuration, I do not know.  However...\n(quote from chat)\n\nI'd blow away my .config stuff for gnome-terminal, but it's a pain to back up profiles.\n\nYou might consider erasing your gnome-terminal configs to start, but after that i am not sure of how you'd fix this.\n\nA: I don't know why, but I ever use the Menu-Key(=on the right between Super and Ctrl) for copy&paste.\nI hope that's a help for you ;-)\n\nA: i've never had problems with this not working unless the cursor focus was not set to the terminal. make sure you've clicked into terminal before trying to paste.\n\nA: I would guess this is a problem with the terminal's inner widget not having focus, perhaps connected to the inner mouse bar.  If you click in the body of the terminal before pressing the keys does that fix it?\n(If this is true, it's a bug.)\n", "Q: Why won't my ~/.Xmodmap file load on login? I created the following ~/.Xmodmap file as per this answer.\nkeysym Delete = Menu\nkeysym Menu = Delete\n\nclear Lock\nkeycode 0x42 = Escape\n\nIn other words, swap Delete and Menu, and make Caps Lock an additional Escape.\nThe next time I logged in, Ubuntu asked me if I wanted to load ~/.Xmodmap as expected. I loaded it, but nothing happened (either then or on subsequent logins). If I manually run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap, it works as expected.\nI know that this worked early in the 10.10 beta, but it's failing on my fresh 10.10 install. I haven't tried in on anything earlier than 10.10. Any ideas?\nEdit: I put some debugging statements in /etc/gdm/Xsession to make sure ~/.Xmodmap was loading, and everything magically started working. I didn't change anything except adding some echos, and it's still working now that I reverted my changes and restarted again. Strangest thing I ever saw.\nOne thing I realized is that the \"remap Caps Lock to Escape\" part of the Xmodmap was always working. It was just the Delete/Menu swap that failed. I'll leave this question open for now in case anyone else has the same problem, since I don't actually know why the problem stopped.\n\nA: Late to the party, but this drove me nuts as well ; and, stubborn as I am, giving up was not an option.\nBasically this is what I tried, (as my user, or root if necessary)\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.Xmodmap only\n\n*~/.xsession, ~/.xsessionrc\n\n*~/.gnomerc\n\n*~/.xprofile\n\n*~/.xinitrc\n\n*/etc/X11/Xsession.d/myscript\n\n*/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ (config files, didn't touch it)\n\n\n(Actually, adding the xmodmap command to ~/.bashrc worked, but it requires to start a terminal each time after login)\nA few years ago(?), xkb was chosen to deal with keys mapping and configuration (interfacing with X), but xmodmap might also request key related changes to X, after xkb did its work during the X session initialization.\nThe problem is when should these xmodmap settings happen?\nIt seems those  above files are processed too early in the process, and either X was not ready to accept xmodmap changes, or xkb would overwrite them.\nNote: I added some \"tracking\" to these files to ensure they were actually running at some time!\nA solution that seems to work\nI was not keen to add a .desktop file initially (a simple one line script had to be enough), but that works, so here it is.\nThe solution comes from How to remap or swap special keyboard keys in Linux? \"solution 1\"\nBasically create ~/.config/autostart/my-xmodmap.desktop file, and put in it:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=MyXmodmap\nExec=/usr/bin/xmodmap /home/me/.Xmodmap\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\n\nreplace me with your username (note that I didn't bother to try ~/ or $HOME that may work equally well in place of /home/me, and the full path of xmodmap is likely not necessary...), and add the exec bit\nchmod +x ~/.config/autostart/my-xmodmap.desktop\n\nThe xmodmap commands have to be in a ~/.Xmodmap file in this case (or use the -e option, or choose another file name!). Log out and back in.\nNote that you might create the starting program from \"Startup Applications\".\nAnother solution would be to forget xmodmap and learn how to configure xkb!\nEdit (again)\nSometimes, maybe 25% of the logons, the xmodmap still seems not working - while the command is actually run (a tracker proves that). The only conclusion I might come to at this time is that the xkb process does run late in the logon process, and may end after the xmodmap has run. Looks like a race condition... So, finally, I changed the autostart desktop file exec line to\nExec=$HOME/bin/mystart &\n\n(note the &)\nmystart is a script in a new directory bin I created that contains\n#!/bin/bash    \nsleep 5\n/usr/bin/xmodmap /home/me/.Xmodmap &\ndate >> /tmp/xmodmap-has-run\n\nand\nchmod u+x ~/bin/mystart\n\nThe script sleeps 5 seconds before to run xmodmap, and tracks when it did run (in the file /tmp/xmodmap-has-run).\nHopefully that will be all!\n\nA: Here is, perhaps a better answer then: http://cweiske.de/howto/xmodmap/ar01s06.html\nYou may have to tweak it a little bit to work for you but the instructions are all there.\n\nA: Perhaps you have a syntax error in your ~/.Xmodmap file?\nTry running:\n$ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\n\nThat should fire an error if there are any.\n\nA: Unfortunately, this looks like a (very) long standing issue, and it is just because after Gnome 3.6, xmodmap support was dropped.\nThis is discussed in Remap keys on GNOME3.8 using xmodmap? and Bug 873656 - .Xmodmap file not loaded by Gnome 3.x .\nThe solution is to move to xkb. There is a bit of help from comment 29 in the second link.\n\nA: I know it's silly but as a workaround you could just autostart xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap. \nAlso you could check /etc/gdm/Xsession for the line usermodmap=\"$HOME/.Xmodmap\" and if it isn't there just append it at the end of the file. If you're the only user of the system just put your changes into /etc/X11/Xmodmap.\n\nA: I had the same weird problem, trying to start up my xmodmap while logging in my session (Ubuntu 13.04). I finally made it work with a .xinitrc file in my Home folder where I put my command, but with absolute paths to it, that is:\n/usr/bin/xmodmap /home/MYNAME/.Xmodmap\nThen I had to reboot (not just relog) so that it would be executed.\n", "Q: I have a HP Probook 4510s and everytime I plug it in, the monitor dims anyone else notice this on their laptops, or is it just mine?

Does anyone know it?\n\nA: You should have a look at pgrep and pkill, two very handy and powerful utilities that are found on most Linux and UNIX systems.\n$ apropos pgrep\npgrep (1) - look up or signal processes based on name and other attributes\n\n\nA: You can run ps -A in the terminal to show all the processes (with their process ID) that are currently running.\n\nA: I also had a similar problem.  I used pstree -p; this showed me the current running processes including Process IDs.\n\nA: My favorite is pstree -p | grep $(program_name). This actually greps the process, highlights it and shows the pid in parenthesis.\nMy next favorite (especially when programming and needing all pids from process) is pgrep -law \"\". This literally gives you every pid running followed by the application (with absolute path).\nThis can be reduced to pgrep -lw \"\" for pid followed by program name or even just pgrep -l for all pids\nOf course, you can search for a particular program (or part of a program's) name. (i.e. pgrep -lw firef will probably display something like \"4567 firefox\").\n\nA: The command to find out a process's id (given its name) is pidof. However since your intention is to kill the process, there are better/easier ways than using pidof to find its pid first:\nAssuming the process you want to kill is uniquely identified by its name (or you want to kill all the processes with that name), you don't need to know its pid. You can simply do killall processname.\nIf there are multiple processes with the same name, but you only want to kill one of them, using pidof won't help you much, because it will give you the pids, but it won't give you any information to determine which of the pids belongs to the process you actually want to kill.\nIn this case you can do ps aux | grep processname which will shows all processes with the given name as well as the console they're running on (if applicable) and the arguments they were invoked with, which hopefully allows you to identify the process you're looking for.\nIf the process opened any X-windows, you can also use xkill to kill (invoke xkill and then click on the window).\n\nA: pidof. Issue man pidof for details.\n\nA: This answer, from @Ben on a duplicated question, has solved my problem:\nConsider using the top command in terminal.\n   The  top  program  provides  a dynamic real-time view of a running\n   system.

If I go into the history or details, the percentage is recorded correctly.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This is known bug that affects HP, Compaq, Dell and other manufactures. This is because of a change made in gnome-power-manager where by the estimate is done on time remaining, rather than percentage.

Selecting the encryption option at install time to encrypt the home partition. Does this enable encryption of the swap partition or is the swap partition unencrypted. If the swap partition is unencrypted, how do I encrypt the swap and home partitions.\n\nA: No, data written to the swap partition is done so in cleartext. If you're looking to encrypt your swap partition, then you may find dm-crypt useful. This article talks about applying dm-crypt to the swap area.\n\nA: By default, selecting the “Encrypt my home directory” option at install time will encrypt your swap space¹ as well - at least in Ubuntu 10.04 and newer (I don't know when this was implemented, so it could well be earlier).\nTechnically, it uses the ecryptfs-setup-swap program to do the swap encryption.  You can use this tool if you want to encrypt your swap space post-install.\n¹: This applies to both swap partitions and any swap files you may have set up. \n\nA: No, only the /home partition is encrypted. If you want more, you should use LUKS.

I can't install Ubuntu 10.10 on my notebook, because I simply can't even start the Live CD... I always get the following message:\n\nKernel panic - not syncing attempted to kill init!\n\nSee the complete message in this pic:\n\n\nA: Maybe this is a bug as txwikinger wrote. But sometimes the CD was not burnt correctly or has some scratches on it. You should try burning Ubuntu to another CD and boot again.\n\nA: Submit at bug with this information at launchpad\n\nA: Try installing with the Alternate CD, work in many cases when the LiveCD fails. \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/alternative-download#alternate\n\nA: Kernel panics are either due to a problem with the live cd or hardware problems.\nTo check the cd, when you download the iso, check the md5sum (using md5sum ubuntu.iso and then comparing it to what it should be). When it is burnt, you can check the md5sum of the cd.\nIf these are both fine, then the cd is probably fine.\n\nA: It's going to be difficult to report a bug with good information if you can't even boot the CD! Here's some information on how you can maybe get better help. \nAccording to the Kernel Team's FAQ you can try these debugging procedures to see if they can help you. If not the FAQ recommends:\n\nThe Kernel Team is primarily IRC based\n  as we are located in disparate cities\n  throughout the world. We typically\n  hang out on the #ubuntu-kernel channel\n  on FreeNode, please be patient if we\n  seem to be quiet.\n\nPlease make sure to reference the picture you've taken as it will be handy.\n\nA: I would run \"Check disc for defects\" option at the boot stage of the CD.

I can't connect my Ubuntu client on a Wi-Fi ad-hoc connection. I tried Windows XP and 7 on server, no success. I can't use Linux on server, only Windows. Thanks.\nRealtek RTL8187B.\n\nA: I have set up an ad hoc wireless connection between a xp machine and an ubuntu. Here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*On ubuntu in \"edit network connections -> wireless\", I clicked on \"add\" and I gave network name \"ubuntu\"  and selected \"ad-hoc\" connection and gave a static ip and saved it. I restarted wireless by right clicking network indicator in the system tray and ticking off \"wireless\" and ticking it on again.\n\n*On xp first you need to give a static ip for wireless LAN. I turned on wireless in xp and it detected the \"ubuntu\" network. If it doesn't work, create a network of the same name \"ubuntu\" on xp, and try if it works. \n\n*It takes a minute or two on xp to connect to ubuntu after the detection or selection of \"ubuntu\" network. I have connected multiple pc having both ubuntu and xp simultaniously.\n\n*But even I am facing an issue. Xp won't allow ubuntu pc to access any windows services, even I couldn't ping xp from an ubuntu machine. But ubuntu will allow access to all its services for xp machines.\n\n\nA: Have you verified that the drivers for your wireless card are properly installed and working?\nI suggest looking at this similar question: Unable to Connect to Wireless Network\nIf you could update your question with the same feedback from that question, we could probably help you pinpoint a solution. :-)\n", "Q: Why doesn't 3d acceleration work? Hello first of all and sorry if my english is hard to understand hehe\nI've been using Ubuntu since 9.04 and I used the 3d effects.\nBut since the 9.10 version, the drivers stop working. I have a Nvidia GeForce 5200fx and everytime I download and install the driver \nthe resolution changes to 640x480 and I can't change it to 1024x768 again. I tried everything, even using 3d acceleration with nouveau drivers (in this case, my\nresolution doesn't change, but anyway I can't use the 3d effects).\nI know that my video card is very old, but is there a way to make it work?\n\nA: Nouveau does not yet have 3D accelleration for nvidia video cards. It should have it within a few months, I think. At this time, those of us with Nvidia video must use the hardware drivers to enable 3D.\n\nA: Which driver version did you install? the Ubuntu and Nvidia developer recommends nvidia-96 for legacy device.\nBtw, can you show some last line your Xorg.log. You can see it in System > Adminstration > Log file Viewer.\n", "Q: The connection of Wine and PlayOnLinux I'm about to install wine on my new ubuntu 10.10 installation, however I can't determaine if I should install Wine or PlayOnLinux. I've already read over the following page http://wiki.winehq.org/PlayOnLinux, however the differences are not very clear and I don't understand if I just have to install Wine or both or just PlayOnLinux.\nAlso could someone tell me if PlayOnLinux is an add-on for Wine or not? If it is then it would certainly clear a lot for me. And do I need winetricks?\n\nA: I personally use POL exclusively. \nImho there is no need for using Wine in addition to POL. POL offers a way of manually adding software that is not yet supported by POL-Scripts (the installation scripts that should do the configuration of the installation process for every software individually) and you have many tools built in like the registry editor for editing the registry values of any installed software, winetricks and many more. \nBut the most important convenience for me is the possibility to simply switch beetween installed wine versions (say you installed four applications with four different wine versions in four different prefixes (well, you didin't - the POL scripts did) then you can switch the wine version for any application to \"system\" (using system default) to any other version that was used before by POL).This is really convenient. \nI don't see any reason for using plain wine in addition to POL. \nmy 2c, \npiedro \n\nA: PlayOnLinux is an interesting project set to overcome some of the issue that Wine Development has. Since supporting Windows applications isn't a science, one Windows application may work flawlessly in Wine 0.9.1 but become defunct in 0.9.2 due to an update in Wine to make another program work. There is typically also a lot of tweaks that need to be made to make programs that aren't Platinum status work properly. PlayOnLinux solves all that by setting up individual Wine versions and Prefixes for each game - using the best version of wine, and applying all the tweaks, that make it work as best as possible.\nIn short, you can certainly install POL and Wine side-by-side without any troubles. Items that aren't in the POL library will just be installed using whatever Wine environment you have setup.\n\nA: You should install Wine as well as PlayOnLinux so if something does not work, you can try PlayOnLinux and see if you can get it to work.\n", "Q: How to stay productive? What time management software is available? So since I started using askubuntu.com I've spent entirely too much time here answering other people's questions. Now maybe someone could help me with that by answering this one. I'm looking for time management software for Ubuntu.\nThere are a number of these programs floating around for Windows. RescueTime is one that is very popular. The key features that I'd like to see in a linux app that RescueTime has are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically records what application you are using, including what websites you visit. \n\n*Reports and graphs on your time usage.\n\n*Notifications for when you have spent too much time on \"distractions.\"\nWhile RescueTime doesn't officially support linux, there is an open source RescueTime Linux Uploader. Unfortunately, it seems to only support Firefox and Epiphany for website tracking. I'm a Chromium user.\nThe other major drawback to RescueTime is that it is a web service. I'd much rather not upload detailed information about how I spend my time to some third party. Google already knows too much about me as it is.\nProject Hamster, a GNOME time management app, comes so close. Sadly, it does not automatically track what you are doing. If I had enough discipline to manually report to an applet what I was up to, I doubt I'd need this. (How cool would it be if they provided some Zeitgeist integration to handle that part?)\n\nA: Project Hamster as you said is great, and while it cant track what you are doing, it can track what workspace you are using, and switch the time spent on it on your project; I have 12 workspaces, 1 for graphic, 1 for code development, 1 for testing, 1 for email and web surfing, and so on..\nI bet if you just need to configure how do you use workspaces and Hamster.\nAnother suggestion may be Makesometime.com, but this is a web service and doesnt do nothing automagically, so i dont think it fits you\n\nA: I have just found a program named \"arbtt\". It can be installed via the Ubuntu repos. For further information have a look at its webpage. To put it in a nutshell arbtt records your open active and inactive windows (don't worry, it distinguishes between the current state^^) and then stores the log locally. Then the information can be read by arbtt-stats which can be configured to your needs by a simple language. Haven't tried it out yet, but definitely will as this sounds really interesting.\n\nA: I also believe that time management tools are essential in order to stay productive. One way to stay productive is to avoid distractions, which will allows you to limit wasted time. Airplane Mode is a great way to avoid distraction when working. With this mode you need to turn off all your gadgets like your mobile phone. This will avoid you getting distracted by text messages and phone calls.\n\nA: For managing people working from home plus for recording hours worked http://www.timedoctor.com is a fantastic program as it will give you an email every day with a list of your team and what they have done, plus a list of tasks they are working on.\nThere are multiple time management principles that are used in the software to increase productivity. You should try it.  \n\nA: Hamster doesn't automatically track your actions, but it can be set to remind you every few minutes, which I actually find more useful.  You can ask yourself every n minutes \"am I still doing what I was planning to do?\", \"should I stop now?\", \"why am I not doing what I planned to be doing?\"  Then you can change course right away, rather than at the end of the day finding you spent three hours on askubuntu. :-)\nUltimately I want to develop more mindfulness of where I'm using my time, and these questions help.\n\nA: Can't comment on the Zeitgeist answer, so I have to write this in a new one:\nThere is a tool called Activity Journal written by the Zeitgeist developers. It can at least show you, what you did when at the day and does this automatically. Additionally it provides you fast access to the files you used as they are not only listed but also clickable so you can open them directly from Activity Journal.\nAtm it lacks real productivity features, but I bet it can be extended to include these. At least it's a real helpful tool to quickly gain information on what you did when and jump to these files.\n\nA: I use the rescuetime linux uploader and RescueTime. Unlike other which require you to report what task you are working on, it tracks what program is open and tells you how much time you spend off task or on task. Sign up for rescue time and they give you a link to the linux uploader (independantly maintained). \nThe released version comes with a firefox and epiphany plug in, if you need a chrome plug in use the expiremental or chrome test version.\n\nA: In the meantime, RescueTime has released their own client.\n\nA: Hmm...\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically records what application you are using, including what websites you visit.\n\n*Reports and graphs on your time usage.\nWhy you not using zeitgeist?\n\nA: I use http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerMode. I think one of the main advantages is that Emacs is not going anywhere anytime soon and some of the other PIM's my get forked into something else or may die altogether. Plus if you use it already it just adds that much more value to Emacs. \n\nA: I am using proofhub from couple of months , it can track what you are doing  and other features like to-do's, time tracking, casper mode, discussions make this tool very easy to use. Its 30 days free trial is also available\n\nA: Lots of tools are available in market like timedoctor, proofhub and hamster that can help you out. I have tried both proofhub and hamster both helped me a lot. \n", "Q: Mounting a remote drive and setting user-id I'm about to do a fresh install of 10.10 Desktop on my work PC.\nI previously had 10.04 and I had the /home of our main server mounted to /mnt/home.  I remember back then I had to change my local user id to match that used on the id of my user on the remote server, so I will have the correct permissions to all my files.\nMy question is whether I can set this id during the setup or must I do it post installation (effectively changing the automatically assigned id).\nAlso, is that the best practice to work on a mounted location or is there anything more elegant?\n\nA: Preseeding can be used with the Alternate CD to specify several parameters of the initial user, including the UID; this might work with the regular Desktop CD as well (GUI installer).\nConcerning the ID matching between client and server, this really depends on the protocol  that is being used to share the files over the network: NFS usually requires matching UID on the client and server; SMB/CIFS does not (but it requires an additional \"login\" step when you mount the remote filesystem).  NFS is traditionally used in UNIX environments, while SMB/CIFS is the (only) network filesystem available on Windows hosts (by default).\n", "Q: Live CD works OK. Is it OK to assume a new install will work? I've got a Toshiba a505 laptop and tried the live CD with great results.\nHowever, I haven't found any reports on this PC working 100% OK on Ubuntu 10.10 yet. I do have seen (and tried installing myself) some reports that 10.04 didn't work (without some dirty hacking).\nIn regular circumstances, is it OK to assume that a new install will work if the live CD works?\nAre there any tools I can run to check compatibility?\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes and no. The Live CD is a great method of trying Ubuntu before you decided to install it properly, but you also have to remember the Live CD is running off default drivers and not the ones actually in your laptop. So for example, your graphics card will not actually be fully used as the driver for it will not be active.\nIf the Live CD runs Ubuntu quite well, then you can assume that your machine can at least run Ubuntu, but again, until your hardware is utilized, you will not know for sure.\nThe best way to find out if your laptop is compatible is to search for your laptop in google with ubuntu in the search query to see if anything interesting comes up. Sometimes, another person may have submitted a bug report or review about how successful there install was and this can be very helpful to you, if you encounter problems.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: So, up to my knowledge, you will not face a worse situation with the actual installation in comparison with the situation you experienced with the Live CD. You -at least- have that working level at hand. Some special drivers and/or settings of your choice will serve as a bonus.\n\nA: Also to expand some on James' post, remember that the Live CD will not have any updates or bug fixes... so something that does not work on the Live CD may work after all the updates are installed.\n\nA: The simple answer is - yes, but it doesn't provide 100% verification. Sometimes Live CD or USB will provide good performance while system installed from the very same Live CD or USB will suffer from misconfigured drivers with (very) severe performance penalty.\nSee https://askubuntu.com/questions/79878/live-cd-live-usb-much-faster-than-full-install for reference. It seems I had a bad luck and I got misconfigured Ubuntu on both of my laptops.\n", "Q: Synaptics touch pad disable button not functional I have a Compaq Presario CQ60-307EA Laptop which has the Synaptics touchpad. It works fine, but one thing that's never worked is the disable button above it, which should completely turn off the touchpad. But when the disable button is pressed nothing happens, the light changes to orange like it should, but it isn't disabled and is still active.\nI was wondering if anyone had got their Synaptics touchpad disable button to work. I find it strange as my friend has a Compaq Presario CQ61 which is a slightly different model, but still has the Synaptics Touchpad and his disable button worked fine, yet mine doesn't.\nAny help on getting it to work would be great!\nThanks!\n\nA: JanC thanks for posting those guides. I have semi fixed the problem, so I thought I'd post the answer in a seperate post.\nBasically what I've done is use gconf-editor to go to: /apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings \nLooking at the TouchPad entry the default was \"XF86TouchpadToggle\". However, after creating a keyboard shortcut for the touchpad disable button registered as Help not XF86TouchpadToggle, so I've now changed the value to Help in gconf-editor and my disable button works. The only problem is I have to press the disable button twice for it to be disabled and like wise to re-enable the device.\nIt does work now though, which is something. It even registers the disabling and re-enabling of the touchpad with a notification in the top right, which is pretty cool.\n\nA: I suppose the hotkey on your laptop is not recognized by Ubuntu (kernel or Xorg) yet.  You might want to read the hotkey architecture overview and troubleshooting guide and file a detailed bug report if you find out what's wrong.\n", "Q: Where can I find Vim 7.3?

In that case you will have to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and change the line starting with \"# defoptions=\" to include nomodeset.\nAfter adding nomodeset to any of those files, you should also run sudo update-grub (I see that's not mentioned in that forum post).\n", "Q: How to Configure Fluxbox menu? How do you modify the default Fluxbox menu?\n\nA: To configure fluxbox menu, you need to edit the ~/.fluxbox/menu file.\n\n\nThis file is just a text file, so you can edit it with any text editor. The fluxbox documentation explains the syntax of this file:\n\nThe Fluxbox menu is just a text file that allows you to make subfolders, launch applications, control workspaces, configure fluxbox, and exit X. The menu can take the following commands:\n\n[begin] (MenuTitle)\n\n[submenu]  (SubMenuName) {SubMenuTitle}\n\n[exec] (ApplicationName) {/path/to/program}\n\n[include] (/path/to/meufile)\n\n[end]\n\n[nop] (--------)\n\n[workspaces] (SubMenuName)\n\n[stylesdir] (/path/to/stylesdir)\n\n[config] (FluxboxConfiguration)\n\n[reconfigure] (Reconfigure)\n\n[restart] (Restart)\n\n[exit] (Exit)\n\n\nMost of this should be pretty self explanatory as to what it does. The italicized items > are the words that actually show up on your screen. I will explain the harder to understand items further.\n[nop] - This allows you to put text or an empty line if you wish that will not execute anything but just act as a seperator in your menu.\n[reconfigure] - If you use the menu to change your fluxbox configuration, the changes will not stay after you exit fluxbox. They need to be written to the init file to be permanent changes and can be done by hitting reconfigure after you've made changes you want.\n[restart] - I just want to make sure that everyone knows restart only restarts fluxbox, and not your whole system.\n\n\nA: From the manual page:\n\nfluxbox installs a default menu file\n  in @pkgdatadir@/menu. You can also use\n  fluxbox -i to confirm this action. Of\n  course this system-wide menu can be\n  customized for all users at once, but\n  it is also possible to create an\n  individual menu file for each user. By\n  convention, users create a menu file\n  in ~/.fluxbox/menu . Once you've\n  created your own menu file, you'll\n  want to make sure that you properly\n  declare this location in your `init'\n  file so that fluxbox knows where to\n  look. The value you'll want to add or\n  change is:\nsession.menuFile: \nFor this change to take effect,\n  fluxbox must be restarted. Be sure\n  that your menu is usable, then choose\n  'Restart' from the default fluxbox\n  root menu. This restart is only\n  necessary if you make changes to the\n  'init' file; otherwise, fluxbox will\n  automatically detect your changes.\n\nSee also this wiki entry: Editing the menu\n", "Q: What's a Good Rhythmbox Replacement?

Even some good rhythmbox plugins to add these types of features would be great.\n\nA: Check this little gem out, http://exaile.org/ its goal is to be like amarok but runs natively in GTK.\n\nA: I would suggest to check out banshee media player\nhttp://banshee.fm/\nsee in the page the tab features...\nand it has ubuntu one integration too via plugins search in synaptic :\n\nbanshee-extension-ubuntuonemusicstore\n\nand it has a lot of plug-ins search in synaptic banshee\n\nA: I would suggest Audacious.\n\nA: Amarok used to be really good for features.

You should be able to add as many media locations as you need for it to manage your collections.\n\n\nA: I've found that this Rhythmbox plugin works allowing \"related shuffle\" type of playback.  Install it, enable it, and add a sing to the Play Queue.  Start the Play Queue song and it checks for related artists in Last FM and queues up one song from your library that is similar.  It is rudimentary, but it is the only one I've found that works.\nhttp://mail.gnome.org/archives/rhythmbox-devel/2007-November/msg00047.html\nThe download link is in that message.\nTested as working on Rhythmbox 0.13.1\n\nA: I would suggest to check out DeadBeef and Clementine (Amarok Fork).\n\nA: After trying most of the alternative options over the last 4 or 5 releases of Ubuntu, my favorite alternative to Rhythmbox is Clementine.  It has most of the same features that Rhythmbox has and runs with fairly low CPU usage on my 2.2 GHz system, compared to Banshee or Exaile.  About the only thing it doesn't allow me to do is cross-scrobble from Libre.fm to Last.fm (admittedly, doing this in Rhythmbox is a setting hack).\n\nA: You can get around the one folder restriction by using symbolic links.\nSay your music folder is ~/Music and you want to import ~/OtherMusic, you can put a symbolic link for ~/OtherMusic inside the ~/Music folder. \nIn a terminal: ln -s ~/OtherMusic ~/Music\nYou might need to restart your music player for it to notice the sym-link.\n\nA: Have you tried Quodlibet? It's available in package quodlibet: sudo apt-get install quodlibet\nYou can add music folders with Music -> Open folder...\n(Ctrl+O). It may take a while to scan a whole\ndirectory hierarchy, especially if you have a large collection; you\nwon't see new music until the scan is finished. \nThe basic interface is rather \"barebones\", but it has a lot of plugins\nto enrich it (select menu Music -> Plugins)\n\nA: Use the Songbbird\nDownload\n", "Q: Is there a way to autodetect when a display is disconnected? I am running Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude with the latest Nvidia drivers. Basically what I want is when I disconnect my external display that everything goes back to the main one without having to change the config every time.\nAny help is welcome!\n\nA: First install disper, then download autorandr and follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the external monitor is undocked, run the following command in terminal:\nauto-disper.sh --save undocked\n\n\n*When the external monitor is docked and configured as you want (with Nvidia X Server Settings), run:\nauto-disper.sh --save docked\n\n\n*Try:\nauto-disper.sh --change\n\nwith docked and undocked monitor. It should detect the state and change the configuration.\n\n*Finaly make a keyboard shortcut for auto-disper.sh --change\nI tried to make a script that run it every 3 seconds, so auto-dectection works, but use too much ressource.\nHope that can help!\n\nA: This is a limitation of Nvidia Twinview on Linux. The open source driver will work as expected (though you'll lose 3D acceleration and Compiz).\n\nA: I'm in about the same situation. I use a laptop which is sometimes connected to my external monitor. When it is, I usually want to use only this monitor (because I have it hooked up to an external keyboard & mouse also).\nWhat I found, is that if you have a file called .xprofile, it is called every time the display is initialized (by X.org?). Here is the contents of my file. As you can see, I adapted it from here.\nWhat you should do is save it to ~/.xprofile and then make it runnable (chmod +x .xprofile). Check how your internal and your external monitors are called - do this by running xrandr with no arguments. Mine are VGA1 and LVDS1 respectively. The last thing is to set the EXTERNAL_RES variable to the native resolution of your external monitor.\nNow on boot up, the connected monitor will be used if it is connected. The tricky part is automation (such as removing the cable while Ubuntu is running). I haven't found a very good solution for this, but it seems that switching to a virtual console and back does the trick (Ctrl-Alt-F1 and then Ctrl-Alt-F7). It's a bit quicker than cycling through all the possibilities with the Fn key (which also sometimes messes up the display).\n\nA: Use disper. After installing it, you may want to create two shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*To switch to extrnal display at max resolution: CTRL+E --> disper \"max\" -S\n\n*to go back to PRimary display : CTRL+P --> disper \"max\" -s\n\nA: You can always just press Fn+F8 after disconnecting the monitor. That will probably change it back.\n\nA: Automatic detection would be cool. Meanwhile I found this blog post which shows how to bind a key to a provided script that toggles between displays. It works pretty well for me.

I have a partition to hold my media files and photos. But it does not mount automatically. So for when I open shotwell it lists all my photos as \"Missing\" until I open the partition in Nautilus and then restart shotwell. Is there a way to have it mount on login?\n\nA: If the partition is NTFS type (Windows), then you have to, first of all, install ntfs-3g driver through the Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic or by typing the following line in the console (Applications->Accessories->Terminal):\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\n\nIf you haven't already, create the folder that will be used as mount point.\nsudo mkdir /media/music (you can call it \"music\" or whatever you like)\n\nNow you have all things set, you can start to follow this steps:\n\n1. Get the info about the disk\nGet the UUID of the partition, which is a serial key that identifies the disk.\nsudo blkid\n\nAn example output line should look like this:\n\n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"246699c0-1262-4d0d-94dd-6496b33467d4\" TYPE=\"ext3\"\n\n\n2.

For example, sometimes the USB device will be assigned /dev/sda1, other times /dev/sdb1. This depends on what order you connect USB devices, and where (which USB slot) you use to connect. This can be a major aggravation as you must identify the device before you can mount it. fstab does not work well if the device name keeps changing.\nTo list your devices, first put connect your USB device (it does not need to be mounted).\nBy volume label:\nCode:\nls /dev/disk/by-label -lah\nBy id:\nCode:\nls /dev/disk/by-id -lah\nBy uuid:\nCode:\nls /dev/disk/by-uuid -lah\nIMO, LABEL is easiest to use as you can set a label and it is human readable.\nThe format to use instead of the device name in the fstab file is:\nLABEL= (Where  is the volume label name, ex. \"data\").\nUUID= (Where  is some alphanumeric (hex) like fab05680-eb08-4420-959a-ff915cdfcb44).\nAgain, IMO, using a label has a strong advantage with removable media (flash drives).\nSee How to use Labels below.\nFor udev: udev does the same thing as LABEL, but I find it more complicated.\nSee How to udev for a very nice how to on udev.\nMount point.\nThis is where the partition is mounted or accessed within the \"tree\" (ie /mnt/hda1).\nYou can use any name you like.\nIn general\n\n\n*\n\n*/mnt Typically used for fixed hard drives HD/SCSI.

Equivalent to rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, async.\n* _netdev - Used for network shares (nfs, samba, sshfs, etc), mounting the network share is delayed until after the boot process brings up the network (otherwise the mount will fail as the network is not up).\n\nDump\nDump: Dump field sets whether the backup utility dump will backup file system. If set to \"0\" file system ignored, \"1\" file system is backed up.\nFsck order\nFsck: Fsck order is to tell fsck what order to check the file systems, if set to \"0\" file system is ignored.\n\nA: Check your /etc/fstab - That holds all the information for partitions to be mounted.

It turns out that at some point, a plethora of my music files lost their .mp3/.ogg/.flac file extensions. I'm honestly not sure how this happened, but I'm confident it was something I did mistakenly (or maybe I thought it wouldn't matter since file extensions are mostly cosmetic anyway).\nSo I need to get these file extensions back. I've looked into pyrenamer, but I can't figure out how to match it to files without an extension and then tell it to add the correct file extension depending on the actual type of the file.\nI've also looked at EasyTag. However, it also recognizes music files based entirely on their file extensions. So the music I want to fix doesn't even show up. Brilliant.\nAny thoughts on how to do this?

Additionally you may need to change your /dev/video? for the proper one. \ntvtime option --device /dev/video1 | arecord -D hw:1,0 -r 32000 -c 2 -f S16_LE | aplay -\n\nSomehow, redirecting the tvtime to the proper device (/dev/video?) will result in the audio also being redirected from/to the right way.\nIn order to know which devices you can use you may wish to use this command:\nls -l /dev/video*\n\nWhich will result in a list like this:\ngeppettvs@DYLAN:~$ ls -l /dev/video*\ncrw-rw----+ 1 root video 81, 0 2012-04-21 09:58 /dev/video0\ncrw-rw----+ 1 root video 81, 1 2012-04-21 09:59 /dev/video1\ngeppettvs@DYLAN:~$ \n\nso you will know which devices are available to be used by tvtime (or other software).\nI hope this help you or somebody else.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Play a movie in the desktop as a wallpaper? I was wondering is there a way to play movies in the desktop,like a background?or is it not possible?\n\nA: Here is a tutorial on how to do just this:\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/08/dreamscene-for-ubuntu-ta-very-much/\n\nA: This is possible in Windows using VLC, I don't know if it is possible in Ubuntu, but here are the directions in Windows, could be the same process, I just don't know.\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5549671/set-a-video-as-your-wallpaper-with-vlc\n", "Q: What software is there for brainstorming? I am beginning to write some short stories and I am trying to find some software that may aide me in brainstorming.\n\nA: Freemind is a commonly-used program for mind-mapping.\nWith a little practice, it can easily become a medium for your own thinking process. One of the best features of Freemind is that you can define your own key-mappings, which makes it more productive than other mind-mapping (brain-storming) tools out there. Also, though it is a mature software, it is still actively developed; so you can expect more features coming in as time goes by.\n\nA: Zim is another wiki-like program that allows you to take notes and brainstorm.  It also works with WikiWords and will auto-link notes.\nIt's a little more difficult than Tomboy to setup, but it's a lightweight and powerful note-taking and brainstorming tool.\nZim is in the repos.\n\nA: I find I waste time trying to use fancy mind-mapping tools. Instead, I like using a \"distraction-free\" writing environment such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*PyRoom or JDarkRoom: Full-screen, text-only writing. Forget about formatting. Stop glancing at the clock, and do NOT pause to check your email.\n\n*Typewriter: True to its name, this text editor has no backspace. Just write. You can come back to it later. (Extract the download until you reach Typewriter.jar)\n\n*Single-line visibility in gedit: Blinders for your text editor. Only the current line is visible, so there is no opportunity to get side-tracked rethinking your previous ideas.\n\n\nA: basket is pretty good for it too. It is not so graphical or map oriented, but it allows ideas to be freely explored and different items to be moved around and grouped.\n\nA: I like to use Tomboy for note-taking and for brainstorming.  It works really well, and you can organize all your thoughts into different \"notebooks\" to keep everything together.  IT works with wikiwords, so you can type a word LikeThis and it will automatically link to the note called LikeThis.  If there's no note by that name, Tomboy will create it.\nTomboy is automatically installed, or if it isn't, it's in the repos.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu encrypt the home folder by default? My laptop has been stolen and it contained highly sensitive data. I did have a password that was required to login, but I am unsure if my data is safe. (at this point the data is more valuable than the laptop, so it's a big concern for me)\nI remember Ubuntu having an option to encrypt the home folder on installation, but I don't remember if I picked it or not. What is the default (10.04) ? Also was there a way for me to tell during usage or is it completely transparent?\n\nA: Under the default settings your home folder is not encrypted.\n\nA: You can see that it's in use from the output of the command mount (without any options) in a terminal; when your home is encrypted there should be a line there that says an \"ecryptfs\" is mounted on \"/home/yourusername\".  Similarly, there should be an ecryptfs line with the df command.\nMaybe not useful anymore now, unless you used those commands...\n", "Q: How to hide the titlebar in Opera?

By default, any window that's to be positioned off workspace will be forced to fit into the viewable area.\n\nA: Not that I know of, but if you have your workspaces set up in a horizontal row, you can set up hotkeys to shift a window to above/below workspace, you can shift a window to the top or bottom of the \"cube\". It is then \"offscreen\" and not visible in any of the four workspaces.\n(For example, I have mine set to Super+Shift+Arrow to shift a window to another workspace without \"following\".)\n\nA: Try using the window rules plugin in compiz.

I tried running pitivi from the command line to see if it output any messages, but all I saw were errors about creating thumbnails and then \"Segmentation fault\".

I'm using the Ubuntu 10.10 with both VLC player and MPlayer and already installed the ATI drivers. I watched the same videos on Windows 7 and Ubuntu. But on Ubuntu the images have a lot of tearing. I tried some newbish-configs on my ATI config tool, but nothing changed.\nI tried videos in mkv, avi, rmvb... and in all kinds of resolutions. I would love to see some tips or maybe a solution to this problem.\n(I have searched for similar questions but I didn't find any :/ )\nThe english is not my primary lang so sorry for my mistakes.\nThanks in advance!\n[]'s\nLeonardo\nMy HW Config (Acer Aspire 5740G-6979)\n-ATI Mobility Radeon 5650\n-Intel Core i5-430M\n-4GB Ram\n\nA: Tearing in videos is caused by the video drawing not being synchronised with the refresh-rate of the display.  This results in displaying the top part of one frame and the bottom half on the previous frame at the same time, which is particularly noticeable on sections of video with horizontal panning.\nThe open-source drivers, with DRI2, should be able to synchronise their drawing with the screen refresh properly, even when running with desktop effects enabled¹.  The proprietary nVidia and ATi drivers may not do this properly.\nFinally, disabling desktop effects should eliminate the tearing regardless of what driver you're using - all (sensible) drivers can sync-to-vblank for video in this case.\n¹: Technically, the problem is having a compositing manager running, because that means that all windows are first drawn off-screen and then composited to the display by the compositing manager.  Since the video is first “drawn” offscreen, it's not possible to synchronise this to the screen refresh.\n\nA: The easiest way to get rid of the tearing is to use the open source drivers (so, remove the closed source driver).  Provided that your card works with them of course, but most cards do work (including 3D) with the open source drivers nowadays...\n\nA: ATI has always been problematic for me in regards to video play when Compiz is active.  In fact, I ended up dropping my beloved ATI's for nVidia because of it.  But, I digress.  \nFrom a terminal run gstreamer-properties.  Under the Video tab, try adjusting the Plugin for Default Output.  You may lose some abilities to adjust size of viewing, but you may be able to fix most of the tearing.\nIn the past, I believed I used \"X Window System (No Xv)\", but I was not able to scale my videos in mplayer.\n\nA: Try using xine media player, it uses very little resources. If you still have tearing or stuttering video try killing compiz temporarily.\n\nA: There's no way to have tearing using an ati graphics card ! it has AntiTearing choice on control panel, ask me with my nvidia i have tearing when i dont use compiz , when i use compiz gaming sucks i have half of the fps and bad performance.\nI can say now that compiz and xorg sucks .... and some people believe that linux can reach the desktop pcs .... well dream on.\n", "Q: How to install LibreOffice? (replacing OpenOffice.org) On 10.10 how do I get rid of Openoffice.org, and install LibreOffice without borking my system?\n\nA: As described in the Ubuntu Forum, you need to remove the OpenOffice packages with\nsudo apt-get remove openoffice*.*\n\nDownload LibreOffice from: LibreOffice Downloads\nExtract the file to ~/Desktop\nRename the file to libreoffice\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Desktop/libreoffice/DEBS/*.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Desktop/libreoffice/DEBS/desktop-integration/libreoffice3.3-debian-menus_3.3-9526_all.deb\n\n\nA: There is an official LibreOffice PPA for Ubuntu 10.10 and 10.04 (the upcoming 11.04 will have LibreOffice by default).\nYou need to add ppa:libreoffice/ppa in your software sources to add it to the software center, just follow the instructions for the GUI way.\nQuick and dirty CLI instructions (these will remove OpenOffice.org):\nAdd the PPA and install LibreOffice:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice \n\nFor GNOME integration (for people running default Ubuntu):\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-gnome\n\nor for KDE Integration (for people running Kubuntu):\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-kde\n\nFabian Rodriguez adds:\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu do not download the .deb files for manual installation, there is a PPA repository that has been available for a few weeks now. Follow these instructions to install LibreOffice from the PPA so you get automatic updates.\nKeep in mind a PPA is always considered a third-party application and unfit for production purposes, however LibreOffice is becoming part of Ubuntu officially in the next release, due in April 2011, so the PPA will get a lot of attention and care. Make sure you test this and perhaps wait a few weeks if you intend to use this in 10.04 LTS or 10.10 in any significant way.\nAdditional language modules, help files and extensions are also available if you search for libreoffice in your package manager.\n\n[If you get an \"unmet dependencies\" error, you probably need to uninstall openoffice (the installation of LibreOffice will continue automatically immediately after openoffice is purged from the system)]\nsudo apt-get purge \"openoffice*.*\"\n[Also note: I got an error about Java : you may want to check that is installed before installing LibreOffice]\n", "Q: How to start an app with \"Always On Top\" set? There are a couple of applications that I find myself marking as \"Always on Top\" every time I use them, so I wonder if there is a way to automatically set them as so, whatever way I start them (menu, shell, gnome-do)?\n\nA: There is a more general solution, working with a EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager (all commonly used wm are included).\nThe solution concerns the use of the wmctrl application (found in wmctrl package).\nYou can set the \"on-top\" property with\nwmctrl -r \"window title\" -b add,above\n\nThere is, however, some work left to automate the process.\n\nA: There are two methods in which you can achieve this.\n\n*\n\n*This method is permanent:\nInstall Compiz and then compiz-plugin.

I'll be using server administering gui tool 'webmin' for backing up resources like apache configuration files, mysql, cvs, the directory /var/www, and the entire webmin configuration files. Sometimes these are not backed up and I will check them with their date of modification.\nIs there a best way to backup all the above resources without any flaw with any other tool or from command line?\n\nA: My vote here for backupninja.  \n\nI think this should handle all your needs here. \nThis application is \"a silent flower blossom death strike to lost data\", and based off of rdiff-backup. \nRuns quietly in the background, as any good ninja should.  Has a very useful and easy setup daemon called ninjahelper.\nFrom the Description page:\nBackupninja allows you to coordinate system backups by dropping a few simple configuration files into /etc/backup.d/. Most programs you might use for making backups don't have their own configuration file format. Backupninja provides a centralized way to configure and coordinate many different backup utilities.\nFeatures:\n\n\n*\n\n*easy to read ini style configuration files.\n\n*you can drop in scripts to handle new types of backups.\n\n*backup actions can be scheduled.\n\n*you can choose when status report emails are mailed to you (always, on warning, on error, never).\n\n*console-based wizard (ninjahelper) makes it easy to create backup action configuration files.\n\n*passwords are never sent via the command line to helper programs.\n\n*in order to backup a db or sql database, you cannot simply copy database files. backupninja helps you safely export the data to a format which you can backup.\n\n*works with Linux-Vservers.\n\n\nBackup types include:\n\n\n*\n\n*secure, remote, incremental filesytem backup (via rdiff-backup). incremental data is compressed. permissions are retained even with an unpriviledged backup user.\n\n*basic system and hardware information.\n\n*encrypted remote backups (via duplicity).\n\n*safe backup of MySQL, PostgreSQL, OpenLDAP, and subversion databases.\n\n*burn CD/DVDs or create ISOs.\n\n\n... I think this is going to be a lot easier for getting started than writing a custom script from scratch, though you may have to work some to get the MySQL databases.\n(Plus, come on, what an awesome name?)\nScreenshot of the \"ninjahelper\" configuration screen:\n\n\nA: There is a package called etckeeper that can transparently keep your /etc configurations files in version control so you can easily back them up, rollback, etc. \nYou can then script this with whatever version control system you use to back it up wherever you want so you not only have backups of the files, but a history of every change made to them.\n\nA: You could use rsnapshot. I use rsnapshot to automate remote backups of a production server, following this guide. \n\nA: I tend to write a cron job which creates a date-stamped folder, I write a SQL dump, then rsync all config files or anything else I want backed-up.\nThen every week, I have another cron task which scp's this to another machine, so I have an offline copy just incase the hard-drive fails.\nI have yet another cron task for deleting backups which are more than 3 months old.\nYou can write stdout to a log file in /var/log or use sendmail to a notify a local account if it fails. That way, when you log in you'll get a notification. (You could also use a twitter/IM bot script to provide notifications.. I use Prosody and an IM bot I wrote [about 150 lines of python] for notifications for one customer's system).\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Why doesn't the new version of Ubuntu 10.10 show up in Update Manager?

Normally it checks every day for new releases, but it sometimes doesn't, so make sure you have clicked the Check.\nIf this still doesnt work, make sure that you have installed all updates to 10.04, and then click Check again.\nIf these don't work, check that the software sources made the release upgrade check to normal, by checking the /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades file and making sure it says Prompt=normal.\nIf after these you still can't see it, try doing this on the command line:\n\"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\"\n\"sudo do-release-upgrade\"\n\nThat should work.\nIf it still doesn't work, then edit your /etc/apt/sources.list file, editing all occurences of lucid with maverick and then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nIf after all this, it still doesn't work, I have no idea what else to do :-P\n", "Q: Installing new kernel (by commandline) as side of old kernel I need to install another kernel(2.6.34) into my fedora/ubuntu machine(x86) and I need to show the old and new boot up options in the boot menu(both new and old kernel)\nI have downloaded the new kernel and I need to compile it and need to build it.\nHow can I complete this from start to finish?\n\nA: Ok here we go on how to compile and install a new kernel :\nFirst the dependencies for all of this :\nsudo apt-get install build-essential makedumpfile\n\nPlus the dependencies for the specific kernel, for a kernel which is in a repository you can do this :\nsudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-\"kernel number\"\n\nFor your kernel, I don't know, maybe they are the same maybe they are differents you should search info on Google for that, it may depend on how you configure your kernel.\nAfter this I suggest you create a place to work in your home folder :\nmkdir src\ncd src\n\nYou can unzip your kernel here or get a kernel from a repository with :\napt-get source linux-image-\"kernel number\"\n\nNow we want to work in the unzipped folder :\ncd linux-\"kernel number\"\n\nAfter this you will need a tool to edit your kernel configuration, there are two different tools and to use them you will have to install their dependencies :\nFor xconfig = sudo apt-get install qt3-dev-tools libqt3-mt-dev\nFor menuconfig = sudo apt-get install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev\n\nI suggest you use xconfig, which is easier to use. To use it you type :\nxconfig = make xconfig\nmenuconfig = make menuconfig\n\nConfigure your kernel as you like and save your configuration. If you don't need it you should disable \"Kernel debugging (DEBUG_KERNEL)\" under \"Kernel hacking\" since that will make the compilation less long.\nTo compile, you type :\nCONCURRENCY_LEVEL=3 sudo make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-something kernel-image kernel-headers\n\nReplace \"CONCURRENCY_LEVEL=3\" by the number of core your processor have +1 that will make the compilation much faster. Replace \"--append-to-version=-something\" by what you want to append to the name of the kernel.\nWait for a very long time, several hours depending on your computer.\nWhen it is finished and if nothing bad happened you will have two beautiful debian packages created in the parent folder, install them :\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i linux-image-\"kernel number\".deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-\"kernel number\".deb\n\nDon't forget to update grub :\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nReboot on your new kernel and, if everything is fine, you're done.\n\nA: Do you really need to compile it yourself?  There are mainline kernel builds for Ubuntu.  There is also info about building your own kernel.\n\nA: There are following steps to install new kernel.\nI m also getting some problem but I want to share how to build new kernel.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest kernel\n\n*Unzip it in any directory.It is usefull to unzip it in ur home folder.\n\n*Go to that folder like cd /home/linux/linux-{version}/\n\n*Now make a new configuration file. For that use 1 of these commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*make config, this will give u config file\n\n*make defconfig, this will give u default config file\n\n\n*After that check whether the config file is suitable or not for your kernel by this command:\nmake oldconfig\n\nIf any option is not there in your config file then it will give you options to select the option <Y/n/m>. The capital letter shows that this is the default option. You can select that option by pressing Enter only.\n\n*make or make -jn where n is 2* no of core processors\n\n*make modules_install\n\n*make install\nRestart your system and select your new kernel option.\n", "Q: Beginner's Guide to Fluxbox Gnome and KDE seem to be pretty straightforward and certainly seem to be the most user friendly in terms of getting setup and running quickly with anything the average user would want to do.\nI am working on implementing Fluxbox on my current install of Ubuntu 10.04 and keep running into gotcha's that require a lot of time to research and then configure.

On every boot the Welcome screen appears where you can select the language and choose to try Ubuntu Live or to install Ubuntu. \nI'd like to remove this screen and have Ubuntu directly start into Live mode with a specific language. How could I achieve that?\n\nA: You should be able to prepare a LiveUSB image for yourself with the Ubuntu Customization Kit\n(reference screenshots).\nBut, I think you should consider installing from a LiveCD to your USB rather than burning the image to your USB. \n\nA: I would like to comment, since this is one of the first results on google, that you should NEVER install Ubuntu on a flash medium as a regular installation. Live usb's make a lot of changes to the way Ubuntu loads in order to prevent damage to your pendrive. There are things you can do to an installation of ubuntu in order to prevent this damage, but do not ever just simply install Ubuntu onto a pendrive unless you do not care if it becomes damaged.\nYou can install Ubuntu directly to a flash medium if you disable the use of swap and switch it to load the /tmp directory directly to the RAM instead of using a /tmp folder on your device. This is extremely important because flash has a limited number of rewrites, and using it for any sort of temporary memory will cause it to become unusable exponentially quicker. LiveUSB starts up with a static image of Ubuntu, with all modifications (the Persistence portion of the usb) loaded from the casper-rw file (or partition if you deleted the file and created a partition on your flash drive labeled casper-rw). this prevents the use of the flash drive for any sort of temporary storage and prolongs the life of the device.\nThose of you who have read this page and simply installed ubuntu to the flash drive without disabling swap/moving the /tmp folder to store data in ram, should do that now in order to prevent damage to your flash drives.\nIf you want anything more than a live-usb version of Ubuntu on your flash drive, you really should just install it to a hard disk (portable or internal, just a device that is not simply a flash medium) in order to proficiently use it/prevent hardware damage.\n\nA: I would also recommend performing an actual INSTALLATION of the OS on a USB device, instead of a LiveUSB with storage. After performing tests with the different solutions, I found with a friend of mine that for the SAME storage device, the LiveUSB version will boot slightly faster (like 5 seconds faster under 10.04) than the real installation. \nHowever, when we tried to then upgrade some of the packages, we ran into a space problem. The LiveUSB installation keeps everything in a SQUASFS file system, which is essentially read-only, and is unpacked as needed. This means that an existing package is in this SQUASH can only be read, not deleted. \nIn short, upgrading packages add up to the used file space, instead of replacing files. The new package files will be used instead, but those new files are just like regular ones. Over time, the load time will increase slightly, as more and more packages will be in regular file system. \nOn a lnger term, LiveUSB is not the solution. Definitely, I would recommend a full installation, which can then be maintained like any other hard-disk installation.\nJust one thing:\nAt the end of the questions, before confirming the installation to start, there is an \"Advanced\" button. Click it to check that the GRUB or GRUB2 will indeed be installed on the proper device that is your USB disk, not the local hard disk. If you see \"/dev/sda\" this is NOT GOOD. /dev/sda is the first internal hard disk. using sda will render your computer unbootable. Change /dev/sda to the one that designates your actual USB disk. \nThis is a mistake I will not forget.\n\nA: Spent ages looking for this, found the below on a different forum, thought might be useful:\nI figured it out. In order to remove the Welcome screen and the Install Ubuntu shortcut on the desktop you must remove the ubiquity installer from you custom LiveCD:\nsudo apt-get purge ubiquity\n\n", "Q: How to generate xorg.conf?

Thanks for taking the time. \nI have a problem I've never had after an upgrade. One of my hard drive, a 1TB NTFS drive connected with the marvell SATA connector (88sx or smth like that ) to my Asus P5Q-E motherboard is not seen, and therefore unmountable in Ubuntu.\nThe problem isn't with the drive or other hardware, because windows 7 sees it fine (in dual boot). Plus it worked just fine before I upgraded. And so for nearly a year.\nThe problem isn't with NTFS libs, because Ubuntu sees the win7 NTFS partition just fine.\nSo I can only guess that the problem is with ubuntu. Because the 10.10 live CD doesn't see it iether.  The 10.04 LiveCD ,however, does see it and mounts the drive, which means it really is 10.10's problem. What should I do?.... Downgrading excluded :-) ! See images for proof.\n\n\nI've tried updating grub (someone suggested it might work...), installing all the ntfs libs, adding it to fstab (as it was before, in 10.04),...but all that failed. Grub update did Nothing, niether did the ntfs libraries. The fstab edit just caused the boot time to take hours, and come back with errors saying it couldn't mount the drive, but not really saying why.\nAny idea for resolving my bug?\nThanks.\n\nA: Think it is Linux kernel problem.\nHave a Asus P5Q Premium with SIL5723 and I guess Marvell drivers (61xx / 88se6121). Everything was working nice when running 10.04.\nAfter installing 10.10 Ubuntu would not recognise disks on the SIL5723. I have part of a Raid 6 on these connectors. ICH10 disks no problems.\nRunning old rescueCD showed Raid was ok. Also recognised by BIOS and see disks when starting the PC. With Ubuntu Live CD 10.10 same problem. Raid however not destroyed as Raid not mounted.\nStarted 10.10 today with kernel 2.6.32 and raid mounted and working perfect. Guess 2.6.32 is long term stable release. However with this kernel I'm not able to run Gparted and there might be other problems as well. Guess 2.6.32 was available as upgraded and did not do a fresh install.\nLooks this is a Linux kernel (2.6.35) problem. I'm not able to find Marvell drivers to install. Not keen on going back to 10.04 either.\nPer Arne\n\nA: see above comment re. testing with sudo fdisk -l. \nAlso, I'm no expert here, but I know that each system device has some sort of system bus parent device that should be recognized by your motherboard. With PCI devices, if you type lspci -v -t it will give you a \"tree view\" format output of all pci devices, with parents. For example, my ethernet card and wireless card are listed under parent of the motherboard Ethernet controller. I do not know if SATA devices fall under this category, but I think a sudo lshw should cover hard drives and SATA devices.  Do so and see if your device is listed. \nThis is not an answer but hopefully may help lead you to one. \n\nA: Hey. I'm answering my own question, but that might help some people.\nYesterday, I did a nice and big Kernel upgrade and it fixed my problem. \nThe new kernel is 2.6.35-23-generic\nTo upgrade the Kernel, come here\nAfter that, I suggest you run\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nWorked for me.

Are there any remote desktop apps?\n\nA: The feature is already installed on your Ubuntu. The \"server\" can be configured in System/Preferences/Remote Desktop, whereas the \"client\" is in Applications/Internet/Terminal Server Client.\n\nA blog entry explain this better than I can: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ubuntu-remote-desktop-builtin-vnc-compatible-dead-easy/\n\nA: As far as I can see, none of the answers posted so far actually implement user-based security, they simply allow access to a running X session. This page talks about how to launch the X windows manager (or login handler) over the internet. This way, the only application user gets access to is the login screen, just as they would if they were sitting at the local terminal.\n\nA: You can use VNC, but to make it secure you have to route it through an SSH connection, which can be complicated to set up. I use NX, which is an X11-only remote desktop protocol. First you have to set up an ssh server and make sure it's open to the Internet. Then install an NX server. Afterwards anyone on any major platform should be able to connect and see their desktop using the NX client.\nThere are a few implementations of the NX protocol, such as the open-source freeNX and the proprietary (but free for the basic version) one by Nomachine.

The external one is, of course, way bigger than the integrated one.\n\n\n*\n\n*So I've been wondering, how do you guys set up your Ubuntu for two monitors? The thing is, I'm quite often on the move without my second screen, so I can't really put panels to the second one, as those would be cramped into the first one, once I unplug the second one, right? Also, same goes for windows I arranged and resized on the big screen.\n\n*Another point would be the wallpaper. At the moment, I'm using a wallpaper that's 1920x1980 (I use 1920x1080 and 1440x900 in a vertical alignment) and set the display mode to \"stretch\", so it covers both desktops. Any easier methods? Don't want to doctor around my wallpapers with gimp all the time.\n\n*As to window window management, I'm currently using compiz and docky. Docky is placed on the top side of the bottom (laptop) monitor so it stays where it was even when the top monitor isn't plugged in. \n\n*what about window placement? My current setup involves using Google Chrome on the top monitor, taking up half of my screen width and being used for regular browsing. Next to it is another Google Chrome window, with the usual \"app tabs\" of GMail, Facebook, Google Reader and Twitter. Auxilliary stuff goes to the bottom monitor.\n\n\nSo, how are you guys using your dual monitor setup? Any awesome programs I'm missing out on?  Maybe one that activates different \"configurations\" (wallpaper, panels, etc), depending on how many screens there are?\n\nA: If you're using Compiz, you should definitely activate the Put plugin and configure the \"Put to next output\" key binding. It moves windows from one screen to the other instantly, no need to drag them.\n\nA: I used Docky and Avant, avant stays always with the laptop, and Docky on the side (left maybe) using intelli-hide, can switch on and off whit the second monitor, at least for me it did.\nTrue with just the laptop, Docky will make your desktop smaller, BUT using intelli-hide once you maximize they disappear...

In my office i want to update and download through (wget) and here they are using proxy?\nHow can i do this by commandline?\n\nA: If you want to run “sudo apt-get update” through proxy in commandline, use below command,\nsudo apt-get -o Acquire::http::proxy=\"http://user:password@host:port/\" update;\n\n\nA: Use this.\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ cat /etc/apt/apt.conf\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://Username:Password@proxy.foo.bar.edu.au:8080\";\n\nThis is what I use. Works perfectly.\nApt also allows individual settings to be placed in files under /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/, so this has exactly the same effect as the above, but may be easier to maintain if you have other lines in the .conf file:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ cat /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/05proxy\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://Username:Password@proxy.foo.bar.edu.au:8080\";\n\n\nA: Ubuntu is incredibly hostile to authenticating proxies.  I use an Ubuntu laptop at work and the number of breakages is incredible.\nSynaptic, Apt, Firefox, Chromium, etc all use different methods for specifying a proxy and there's nowhere to specify credentials securely.\nSome bugs on the subject :\nhttps://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/msttcorefonts/+bug/220070\nhttps://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt-cacher/+bug/198138\nhttps://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/433827\nhttps://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/b43-fwcutter/+bug/683630\nOli's suggestion to use an export is the only vaguely secure way to do it.  It's also sometimes possible to \"fudge\" proxy support if the proxy server is using secondary authentication to minimise load on the main authentication servers (say perhaps Active Directory).  This is where the first proxy connection is authenticated by the proxy against AD, then for a set time period (usually 5 minutes) all other connections are \"trusted\" to be that user.  Therefore, you can open firefox, browse the internet (anywhere will do), then try your utility (wget, synaptic, whatever) by specifying a proxy, but leave the username blank.\nUbuntu is generally hostile to any corporate environment simply because it allows passwords to be read so easily.  Seahorse is a prime culprit, but Network Manager is also shocking - connect to any PEAP authenticated network and you've just stored your password in the applet for anyone to see who might borrow your laptop.  Apparently laptop sharing is considered sacrilege in Linux land, since Seahorse developers rejected claims of insecurity.  After that, I didn't have the heart to contact the network-manager devs.\n\nA: The thing that worked for me was:\nsudo http_proxy=http://yourserver apt-get update\n\nWhich is a bit odd because simply exporting http_proxy and then running sudo echo $http_proxy obediently printed out the exported value\n\nA: If it is a temporary configuration, you could try this:\nsudo bash -c 'http_proxy=\"http://< proxy_host >:< proxy_port >/\" apt-get update'\nYou need this, because the environment variable needs to be defined for the \"root\" account. Doing and export before should not work.\nFor a permanent configuration, you will have to modify a system file. This is already described in the following answer about How to check Network proxy is really applied?.\n\nA: Did you try editing /etc/apt/apt.conf? I use this to use apt behind our corporate proxy.\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://user:password@host:port/\";\n\nI believe that apt uses this value unless $http_proxy is defined in your shell environment (i.e. $http_proxy takes precedence).\n\nA: export http_proxy=http://proxyusername:proxypassword@proxyaddress:proxyport\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThe export shouldn't need sudoing and if your proxy is anonymous, just ditch the proxyusername:proxypassword@ part.\n\nA: In some releases sudo is configured in such a way that all environment variables all cleared when running the command. To keep the value for your http_proxy and fix this, you need to edit /etc/sudoers, run:\nvisudo\n\nThen find a line that states:\nDefaults env_reset \n\nand add after it:\nDefaults env_keep = \"http_proxy ftp_proxy\" \n\nThings will start working as expected.\nThanks to kdogksu in the Ubuntu Forums for finding the solution for this.\nIn order to not only fix apt-get but also graphical X11 utils as e.g synaptic,mintintall, ...) the following line in /etc/sudoers should do the job :\nDefaults env_keep = \"http_proxy https_proxy ftp_proxy DISPLAY XAUTHORITY\"\n\n", "Q: Aptitude in ubuntu 10.10 \nPossible Duplicate:\nTab completion for commands \n\nAptitude command is missing from Ubuntu 10.10. I just installed it using apt-get install aptitude but it doesn't support autocompletion as it was doing in the previous version of Ubuntu. And as a relatively new user i find aptitude with autocompletion of packages names is way easier to use. So how to bring autocompletion back to aptitude on 10.10\n\nA: If you just install it maybe you just need to make aptitude aware of the existing packages (by an sudo aptitude update) and restart your terminal. You can also try : sudo dpkg-reconfigure bash-completion.\n", "Q: How can I add a user as a new sudoer using the command line? After I add a user using adduser, I can't see it via System > Administration > Users and Groups unless I log out and then log in again. Is that normal?\nAlso, can I set a newly added user as a sudoer or do I have to change that only after adding it? How can I do that via the shell?\nFinally, can I delete the original user that was created upon initial installation of Ubuntu, or is this user somehow 'special'?\n\nA: Open the sudoers file: sudo visudo will open the /etc/sudoers file in the editor defined in $EDITOR (probably GNU nano - set the variable if it's not what you want, eg export EDITOR=\"nano\" and try sudo visudo again).\nAdd the below line to the end of the file.\nusername ALL=(ALL) ALL   # Change the user name before you issue the commands\n\nThen perform WriteOut with Ctrl + O. The editor will ask you for the file name to write into. The default will be a temporary file that's used by visudo to check for syntax errors before saving to the actual sudoers file. Press Enter to accept it. Quit the nano editor with Ctrl + X.\nDone!\n\nA: One thing I have to add that I'm sure a lot of people don't understand:\nOnce you have already done a adduser \"username\", you can still come back and do a adduser \"username\" sudo, and it will then add that user to the group properly.\nIt actually won't work the first time around like sudo adduser username sudo. It will give you an error. Which in summary means you must first make the user account before you can add them to a group.\n\nA: I did\nsudo usermod -a -G sudo <username>\n\nas recommended here.\n\nA: on CentOS, I do as root\necho ' username ALL=(ALL)   ALL' >> /etc/sudoers\n\n\nA: The following snippet grants root access to username without explicitly logging in as root.\nMake sure that the user is added to sudo group first. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS.\nsudo adduser username sudo\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'username ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers\"\n\n\nA: All members of the group admin, are in Ubuntu by default allowed to use sudo, so the easiest way is to add the user account to the admin group.\nIf you do not want to give the user account full root access, you need to edit the /etc/sudoer file with visudo (it makes sure that you do not have any syntax errors in the file and lose sudo capability altogether) in a way that you specify what commands this user (or a new group) can execute as root.\nThe sudoer manual will give you more information about this. You can specify which commands are permitted by a particular user/group to be executed as root.\n\nA: Just add the user to the sudo group:\nsudo adduser <username> sudo\n\nThe change will take effect the next time the user logs in.\nThis works because /etc/sudoers is pre-configured to grant permissions to all members of this group (You should not have to make any changes to this):\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nAs long as you have access to a user that is in the same groups as your \"original\" user, you can delete the old one.\n\nRealistically, there are also other groups your new user should be a member of. If you set the Account type of a user to Administrator in Users Settings, it will be placed in at least all of these groups:\nadm sudo lpadmin sambashare\n\nBecause your system configuration may vary, I suggest taking a look at the output of groups <username> to see what groups are normally in use.\n", "Q: How can I change which programs are listed in the context menus for files in Nautilus? I'd like to know how to change some entries makes in 'second button list', that list of programs associated with a file icon.\nSome I would like to remove and others I would like to put in.\n\nA: You can change the items in the Open With menu by\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-clicking the file of the filetype you want to change. (I'm using an MP3 for my example.)\n\n*Choosing Properties from the drop-down menu.\n\n\n*Clicking the Open With tab.\n\nYou can add and remove Open With items there. The controls are fairly self-explanatory.\n\nA: I am assuming you are referring to modifying the list of available actions when you right click on a file in the Nautilus file browser. In which case try installing the nautilus-actions package. This allows you to create custom shortcuts for context menus (the menu, which appears when you right-click the mouse).\nInstall from the command line\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-actions\n\nOr search for nautilus actions in the Ubuntu Software Center\n", "Q: How to make money from/in Ubuntu/Linux? I'm a student right now, and later in life I'd like to get really involved in the Linux ecosystem. However I recognize the need to put bread on the table, so my question is:\nHow can I make money from Ubuntu/Linux?\nThe situation right now is that my College can offer me Windows Certification, or Apple Engineer certification; both of these do not enthrall me as I'd like to stick mostly to Linux.\nWhat job types normally deal with it, what training/certification should I be looking for?\n\nA: Linux Professional Institute offers Linux certifications.  More information can be found at their website: http://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications\n\nA: I suggest you try to find jobs offers that suit what you want to do, you will see what the companies that work with Linux actually need. You can check jobs offers at Bull, IBM, Novell, Red Hat ...\n\nA: While I think Oli's answer above is right on, we'd be amiss to not mention that Canonical, Ubuntu's corporate sponsor, offers a number of training courses and a certification (PDF).\n\nUbuntu Professional\nThe Ubuntu Professional is a training\n  certification for systems\n  administrators who need to deploy\n  Ubuntu in an office environment After\n  completing this course, you will be\n  able to:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Install and configure Ubuntu desktop systems\n  \n*Perform routine administration tasks: boot and shut down the system,\n  manage user accounts and file systems,\n  and maintain system security\n  \n*Configure network connectivity and key network services\n  \n*Work productively at the Linux command line\n  \n\nI honestly have no idea how useful it is though.\n\nA: Certification is available for most areas of Linux but I think you're putting too much focus on it.\nPeople predominately hire people who are competent at what they do, not the hoops they've jumped through to get there. A year of specific industry experience is worth a dozen vague certificates.\nEven if you do want to continue down a road of certification-over-experience (which I can understand for somebody without much real-world experience), in order for the certificate to hold any value, it needs to be locked onto a real-world skill. Few companies will hire somebody solely on the basis that they have a \"generic Linux certificate\". If you want to be a DBA, get certified for MySQL or Oracle. If you want to be a network monkey, look through the various networking certification programmes available.\nI'll add that the good certification programs are both quite hard and expensive (especially at the higher levels) and most of them rely on you having real-world experience for your reasoning.\nAnd if you're applying for newly-grad/junior posts, people won't expect you to have put yourself through a certification programme anyway. They're looking to train up people.\n\nA: I think you probably just want to become familiar with operating in linux environments.. learn how distributed java webapps are built and scaled, learn how to tweak the jvms for different distros, learn how to install and use standard monitoring suites like nagios, learn how to configure apache, mail, samba, ldap, etc.. the list goes on and on.\nThere are so many careers for people with a good variety of these skills it's ridiculous.

The problem is caused by an upstream kernel bug.  You can view the bug report here: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24002.  The last version of Ubuntu with a kernel that showed battery information from a MS-171F laptop motherboard was 9.10 (Karmic).  Unfortunately, Karmic reached its end of life date in April.

I guess it's also a matter of personal taste, but since I'm starting with a fresh 10.10 install I thought maybe this time I'll keep my system more organized.\nWhat is/are the conventional place(s) to store software and applications?\nI have some stuff I get using git (e.g. bioperl), there are some apps I simply  download and extract to some place (e.g. eclipse) and obviously I install software using apt-get.\nWhere is the conventional place to put all of these?\n\nA: The traditional places to install additional software is either /opt or usr/local See also the other similar question\n\nA: For software installed via package management you do not need to care where it is installed, you will only manage it with some package management software like apt-get, aptitude or synaptic anyway.\nThe usual places are, as already mentioned by txwikinger, /opt and /usr/local. I would generally put software that I compile myself into /usr/local, as that has the usual directory structure (bin, lib, ...) already in place. Big software that expects a directory of its own I install into /opt, I think that is the original intent of that folder.\nI'm also using a folder for small, self-contained applications in my home folder for some apps, mainly because my home folder is on a seperate partition that I keep when reinstalling the system. So I don't have to install those applications again. \n\nA: like everyone else said, the package manager will put things where it needs them to be put. \nI tend to have a projects/ folder where I checkout my random git projects.   \nEclipse likes to keep its projects in workspace/ Depending on how much development I do under eclipse I would do something like $HOME/workspaces/{AndroidStuff, CrazyRandomIdeas}  depending on if the things I'm working on should be in its own workspace or is a small project.\nAlso, occasionally I like to install things in my $HOME since i'm just playing with things and don't want to pollute my filesystem, which I tend to put in $HOME/local.  Again this is just my style.. but I end up with\n $HOME/\n      bin/  -->symlinks to binaries I installed locally and added to $PATH\n      local/  --> local installs of applications, libs etc. \n      projects/  --> git check/svn checkouts etc of random code. \n      workspace/ --> eclipse stuff.\n\nTry not to install anything in your root filesystem (/) unless you package it.  It's a royal pain to uninstall things, (there's always a make install but rarely do you ever get a make uninstall).  Also, that's the entire point of a packaging system, to keep track of your programs, files, configs, etc.\n", "Q: What is the relationship between MIME types and File .extensions? I may have the wrong idea here, but I thought that:  \nMIME types are identifying codes, embedded inside a file.\nFile .extensions are idenifying codes, suffixed to the file's name. \nI thought, from something I heard in the dim dark ages, that Linux was .extension agnostic... ( maybe it was in the early days, and things have changed since then...? )\nI've recently come from the Windows world, where, at the Operating-System level, a file .extension is the only way (as far as I know) to associate it with its relevant Application program.  \nBecause I don't know why, I find it a bit disconcerting that a file named  \"fred\" and a file named \"fred.txt\" both open up in a Text Editor.  \nIs there a clear-cut hierarchy at work here?  \n\nA: In the linux world File extensions are only one indicator for the type of a file.\nThere is a command line tool called \"file\" which guesses the type of a file.\nTo get this type there are mainly 3 indicators:\n\n\n*\n\n*The extension\n\n*Special attributes in the filesystem (like for sym- or hardlinks, folders, input device, etc.)\n\n*The content\n\n*\n\n*Binary (like ELF information in executables)\n\n*Textual (like <html>, #!/bin/bash)\n\n\n\nThe relation between the file type and the MIME type is, that MIME is only a standard to represent a file's type (like text/css).\nLinux \"guesses\" the file type and opens an associated program for that type.\n\nA: MIME types are just a way to name types. They don't have anything to do with how the type of a file is determined.\nThere are two ways to determine the type of a file: a) Look at its extension and hope that it is accurate or b) look at its contents and then guess based on that. If a file has no extension b is the only option.\nMany (binary) file formats have a specific header that you can look at to determine their type. This makes option b quite reliable for those types.\nPlain text file formats can often be determined by their structure (if a file contains a lot of html tags, it's probably a html file).\nOn unix and linux systems you can use the file command line utility to find out the type of a file based on its contents.\nFile managers often use some combination of option a and b (e.g. look at the file extension first, if it's not known (or the file does not have an extension), look at the contents).\nA file's type is not stored as metadata on common linux file systems.\n\nA: In Linux, the file extension is part of the file name and doesn't actually mean anything to the operating system. A MIME type is a description of the content of the file. fred and fred.txt would both have a MIME type of text/plain.\nFile managers, such as Nautilus use this MIME type to know which program to open the file with. In a terminal, the xdg-open command does the same thing. However, this is user space level not operating system level.\nFiles don't actually contain this mime type, but the programs that open them use various methods to work out what this MIME type is. Some rely only on file extension, but most use a mixture of techniques including looking at the data at the beginning of the file.\nIf the beginning of the file only contains bytes that can be represented as ASCII characters, it is safe to assume it is a text file. If then the extension is something like .html, the program assumes it is a HTML page and so opens it with a web browser. The same thing works with binary file formats. For example, I know that the bitmap file format begins with 'BMP' in ASCII followed by binary data representing the image.\nPut simply, Linux programs make an educated guess based upon the data in a file and its file extension. This may not sound very reliable but the algorithms used are more complicated than the examples I have given and are actually really accurate.\n", "Q: Is there anyway to use Google Talk, with my Google Apps account?

It came with Windows 7 preinstalled. I've never had a notebook before, but as a desktop user, I was a Ubuntu user since 2 years, and I've never had a problem with drivers, wifi, etc.\nWhen I tried to install the Ubuntu 10.04, and also the new and fresh 10.10, in my new laptop, I experienced some troubles with some of the componentes of my computer. For example, I was not able to activate my wi-fi card, although I know the kernel recognizes it correctly, because when doing \"lspci\" at the terminal, it was listed. \nAnyhow, I'm not able to \"activate\" the wifi, or whatever it's necessary to do in order to be able to search for public networks available, and to connect with them. \nThe wifi-card the laptops brings is the (the lspci output):\n03:00.0 Network Controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR9285\nWireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express) [168c:002b] (rev 01).\nIt's anything in you can help me? Thanks a lot in advance!\n\nEdit\nNeither solution seems to work. In first place, i've tried installig what hhlp told me. After the installation, nothing seems to change: on right-clicking the wireless icon, it seems to recognize the card, because the option \"Enable wifi\" was ticked. But, once again, i was not able to \"turn the wi-fi\" on.\nIn second place, i didn't try installing the drives, because the card is already recongnized. The issue is that i cannot seem to turn it on!\nOne thing i've probably missed is that the Toshiba cames with a windows sofntware that allows you to enable / disable the wifi tools. So, it does not have an external \"button\" to turn it off. I don't know if that's the problem, but i have the feeling that the issue may be aroud there: in how to turn ON the wifi-signal (or to verify if it's on or off) in my ubuntu.\n\nA: you have a ath9k\nath9k is a completely FOSS wireless driver for all Atheros IEEE 802.11n PCI/PCI-Express and AHB WLAN based chipsets.\nAR9002:\n*      AR9220 (>= 2.6.27, an AR9280 card over PCI)\n*      AR9280 (>= 2.6.27)\n*      AR9281 (>= 2.6.27)\n*      AR9285 (>= 2.6.29)\n*      AR9287 (>= 2.6.32) \n\nhave you tried install this :\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-maverick-generic\n\n\nA: You could try this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Atheros/AR9285\n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Atheros/AR9285\nI use the Release Candidate 5 (nov 2010) in my time and it works.\nNo need to know about the wifi button it mention, or any wifi utility on windows.\nIt work I use Ubuntu 10.10 32 bit.\n", "Q: Is there software available to benchmark networking equipment? Is there software, or a utility, available on Ubuntu that I could use to benchmark (performance test) traffic and throughput on networking equipment (specifically Cisco switches or routers)?\n\nA: For general throughput testing, I've used iperf (sudo apt-get install iperf).\nYou start a server on one machine (using iperf -s) and run the client on another machine on the other side of the network. You get a throughput like so:\noli@bert:~$ iperf -c tim\n------------------------------------------------------------\nClient connecting to tim, TCP port 5001\nTCP window size: 16.0 KByte (default)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n[  3] local 192.168.0.4 port 39402 connected with 192.168.0.5 port 5001\n[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth\n[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.04 GBytes    895 Mbits/sec\n\n\nA: hdparm -t /dev/disk can be a good indicator as well, if you mount any of the drives on a server on the other side of the device. comparison between local disk speed on the server and disk speed from a client over the network can be a good indicator.\n", "Q: How can I reverse the 'fn' key on an Apple Keyboard so that F1, F2, F3... are used as default?

I use my laptop with Ubuntu-desktop to do all my work, but I also have a low-end desktop over at my office just sitting there. I've decided I'm going to install Ubuntu-server on it and use it to mirror my entire laptop home folder, to make things easier when I decide to format my laptop's hard-disk.\nWhenever I'm at work, both machines are connected to a network and communicate easily (and high-speed) via ssh. When I'm not at work, the desktop is still accessible via ssh. Ideally, the syncing would take place automatically in the background, whenever I change something. It only needs to be one way: the changes I make on the laptop have to be synced over to the server, but the inverse is not necessary.\nI know there's software for this out there, my question is: What software can I use to achieve the above objectives and also take full advantage of local-network speeds when I'm at work? Since I'll sometimes deal with large files, the syncing process needs to realise that the two computers are sharing a local network, and then take advantage of that (instead of always syncing through the internet). \nJust to be clear, over-the-network syncing is actually more important to me here than over-the-internet syncing. I ideally the software would check if the former is available and, if not, try the latter; but if that's not possible, the first case is my priority.\nHope this isn't too long. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I would suggest using rdiff-backup over rsync.  It's pretty much just rsync++.\nunlike rsync which just a 1-1 mirror that transfers diffs, rsync has a history mechanism.  So if you screwed up and deleted something important, you can revert back to a week ago and get it back.\nOn the ubuntu \"server\" you just need to have ssh running to apt-get install rdiff-backup.\non the client.  I would either run this manually.. or via a crontab.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n  #backup.sh\n\n  rdiff-backup -v5 --exclude path-to-annoyingfile  /home/user/ hostname::/media/data/snapshots/laptop \n  ## this will cleanup any backups older then 2weeks.  Adjust this as needed.\n  rdiff-backup --remove-older-than  2W --force  hostname::/media/data/snapshots/laptop\n\n\n  #!/bin/bash\n  ##Restore.\n  rdiff-backup -v5 --restore-as-of now --force user@hostname::/media/data/snapshots/laptop  /home/user\n\nIf you open up your port 22 to the internet.. you should be able to run the same script either ways.. just have it your hostname resolve locally to your local IP.\nie.   backupSrv.penguins.org   would resolve to the external IP of.  2.3.4.5\nbut inside your lan:  to 192.168.1.253\n\nA: There is no complete, pre-packaged solution to your problem that I know of. You probably have to write some small script yourself for that.\nThe syncing itself could be done by rsync, as already explained by Riccardo Murri. Rsync only transfers the changed parts of files, so it is perfect for this task.\nYou can use the NetworkManagerDispatcher to execute scripts on connection/disconnection of a network interface. So you could write a script that checks if you are on the correct network and then calls rsync. This way your data would be automatically synced when you connect to your company network.\nTo periodically sync your data you can use cron, as already mentioned.  \nYou should also consider security when using rsync via ssh. To synchronize without user intervention you'll need a passwordless keyfile. Anyone who has this keyfile can gain access to the server it belongs to. I would strongly recommend to encrypt your home folder to protect the data on the notebook and on the server.\n\nA: If you can only connect to your office server via SSH, then your best\nchoice is to use rsync: it can use SSH\nas a transport protocol and uses a smart algorithm to speedup the\ntransfer of large files, by sending only the changed blocks.\nSince you only need one-way synchronization, just set up passwordless\nSSH authentication from your laptop to the office server, and then you\ncan start with a command as simple as:\nrsync -e ssh -a $HOME/ myuser@officeserv:\n\nadding --include and --exclude options to refine the list of\nfiles/directory that you want to synchronize. For instance,\ntransferring program settings (\"dot files\") can be risky if the two\ncomputers do not run the same OS (same version).  My suggestion is to\nstart by excluding all \"dot files\" (so, use\n--exclude=\"$HOME/.[a-z]*\") and then selectively add the\nconfiguration directories of programs that can safely be shared (this\nhas to be seen on a program by program basis).  In addition, web\nbrowser cache and $HOME/.cache can always be excluded.  See the\n\"FILTER RULES\" section in the rsync man page for a detailed\ndiscussion of the include/exclude rules syntax.\nHowever, rsync does not have a \"continuous-operations\" mode, so you\nwill have to run it periodically from your\ncrontab.\n\nA: DropBox | DropBox @ SuperUser\nhttp://www.dropbox.com/help/137\nDropBox should be good in your case, works on Linux, mac, windows, easy setup and management.\nDownload DropBox\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/147315/dropbox-to-sync-nix-home-folders\nhttp://wiki.dropbox.com/TipsAndTricks/SyncOtherFolders\nHave a read through - it does support syncing via symlinks and if there are certain doc, graphics, spreadsheets you have to sync - you still can maintain a copy of them in dropbox or permanently save them in dropbox location to save the hassle.\n\nA: Try Sparkleshare: http://sparkleshare.org/\nThere is a client in the Ubuntu repo and it has instructions on how to setup a server on their website.\n\nA: The best solution for 2015 should be Seafile: https://www.seafile.com/en/download/\nSparkleshare Developers say themselves their tool is good for many small and especially text files, but not so good for bigger and binary files..\nAnd in terms of performance it outperforms both Sparkleshare and Owncloud.\nAddtional it is far less ressource hungry then OwnCloud - so an instance can run on a Banana or Raspberry without any problems as an 24/7 running computer. (I would recommend an Banana Pi though, because of the Gigabit network and the SATA interface, it was a good choice for a file server at least for me.)\nI sync my home folders with three computers. I exclude dotfiles, they are handled over a git repo and some logic around because - as Ricardo mentioned - there are some problems in sharing dotfiles and other configuration over different computers, even when its the same OS and release. Think about the monitors.xml for example, or some different layout for an IDE on you laptop and your multiscreen desktop - or a program opened on both computers.\nAdditonal to syncing, I backup this data - via borgbackup. Its a very nice new backup program, which does deduplicating, is very fast after the initial backup and and has a lot of features many tools are lacking.\nIts the perfect setup for me.\n", "Q: How to create a music CD from mp3 files?

Trying to suspend from the menu also does not work, the screen goes black and the system freezes.

I'd like it to be gray for example.\nHow to change the color of that text?\n\nA: To change that property, you'll need to hack the gtkrc file for the theme in question. I presume that you're working with Ambiance.\nThe first thing you probably want to due is make a local copy of the theme instead of working on the system wide copy. Let's call it Ambiance-Mod. Open a terminal an run this:\ncp -r /usr/share/themes/Ambiance ~/.themes/Ambiance-Mod\nYou also need to edit the index.theme to use your new theme.\ngedit ~/.themes/Ambiance-Mod/index.theme\nChange all instances on Ambiance to Ambiance-Mod\nYou should have Ambiance-Mod in your \"Apperience Preferences.\" Now let's edit the gtkrc file.\ngedit ~/.themes/Ambiance-Mod/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\nThe the part that controls the text you'd like to change can be found on line 334, fg[INSENSITIVE] for style \"menu\" = \"dark\"\nstyle \"menu\" = \"dark\" {\n    xthickness = 0\n    ythickness = 0\n\n    bg[NORMAL] = \"#43423f\"\n    bg[INSENSITIVE] = \"#43423f\"\n    fg[INSENSITIVE]   = shade (0.54, \"#43423f\")\n\n    engine \"murrine\"\n    {\n        roundness = 0\n    }\n}\n\nYou need to change shade (0.54, \"#43423f\") to use your desired Hex color. Try something like \"#969696\" Make sure it is quoted.\n\nIf you're not afraid of messing up the original theme, you could edit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc directly and skip the parts about copying the theme and renaming things in index.theme\nIf you'd like to play around with more options, check out the GTK Theming Tutorial on the GNOME wiki.\n", "Q: Hard drive partition naming convention in Linux What is the hard disk drive partition naming convention in Linux (for example : [hd0,0] etc...)? What does it actually mean?\nWhat is the significance of this when I need to install multiple operating systems on the same machine?\nHow can we relate it to Windows partitioning (example: C:\\ drive or D:\\ drive) ?\n\nA: I think now most hard disks use the SCSI interface, therefore the device is not /dev/hdx but rather /dev/sdx. USB sticks and external USB hard disks use the SCSI interface (therefore /dev/sdx). The same goes with eSata external hard disks.\nAs the devices are connected to the system, they occupy the next available drive letter.\nFor the first hard disk, /dev/sda is the raw hard disk (it points to the start of the raw hard disk). The partitions are /dev/sdaN, where N=1,2,3,4,5,6...\nWith the DOS compatible partitioning, you get four primary partitions (1 to 4). One of those primary partitions can be an extended partition, which means that you can further partition the interior to more partitions. In this case, the first of those, called logical partitions, is /dev/sda5. Further logical partitions are 5, 6, 7, ...\nTypically you create a big extended partition and then you can add as many logical parititons as you wish.\nFor the mapping of Windows partitions (for example, which is C:), you need to find a Microsoft report which explains how the operating system assigns driver letters. There is a report on their website, I do not have the URL handy :-(.\n\nA: The first element in this case hd0 represents a physical hard drive in your system. The 0 represents the first one it has detected. For example if you have two IDE hard drives, the first one would be hd0 and the other one would be hd1 and so on. The second element namely the ,0 represents a given partition within that hard drive. So in the case of hd0,0 this would represent the first partition on the first hard drive. So if you had a boot partition in this reference with grub loaded on it you would define hd0,0 as your boot partition in your Grub conf file.\nHope this helps. \n", "Q: What software can be used to create a restorable drive image? Not sure what Linux software I would use for this. I'm looking for something like Acronis True Image for Windows, but for Linux. The rule is that we are keeping Windows out of the equation, I want to be able to rely solely on Ubuntu to handle the management and restoration of backup images.\n\nA: Clonezilla is fairly popular though I've never used it. I would imagine you should be able to install it to its own partition and hack it into grub so it's there as a boot option (which I assume is what you're going for).\nBut most people just boot to it on CD or USB.\n\nA: A simple solution is to use the dd command.\nTo back up a drive partition (eg. /dev/sda1), run this command:\ndd if=/dev/sda1 of=~/sda1_backup\n\nand to restore:\nsudo dd if=~/sda1_backup of=/dev/sda1\n\nFor more information on the dd command, see man dd.\nTo reduce the space used by the backup images, you could use gzip, bzip2 etc. to compress the images. If you do this, you will need to decompress the images before restoring.\n\nA: Personally I use these:\n\n\n*\n\n*clonezilla \n\n*g4l\n\n*systemrescuecd\n\nA: A somewhat newer tool is FSArchiver, which is included on the SystemRescueCD and supports restoring to partitions smaller than the original as long as there is enough space for all files.  It works with most filesystems that linux supports, can preserve both \"basic\" and \"extended\" attributes (e.g. for SELinux), can compress the archives with lzo, gzip, bzip2 or lzma, and can store the archives encrypted.\n", "Q: Unlock keyring prompts three times instead of one time When I have \"automatic login\" activated, the \"Unlock the Gnome Keyring\" box asks for my password. But this happens three times. There are three boxes asking me for my password. In 10.04 the box appeared one time.\n\nA: Make sure you've disabled auto login as per this guide:\nhttp://www.liberiangeek.net/2010/10/disable-auto-login-ubuntu-10-0410-10-maverick-meerkat/\nThen when you login again & are prompted to unlock keyring, click \"Details\" & there will be an option to automate the unlocking process.\nRepeat for each prompt.  \nYou should now only be prompted the one time at login.\nThis worked for me, hope it is some help to someone...\n\nA: Take a look at \"Passwords and Encryption Keys\".

However, you have to unlock every single bundle after logging in (and a program tries to access it).\nHere's what it should look like:\n\nGood luck\nTom\n\nA: The keyring prompts are because your keyring and logon passwords are different or your system is set to autologon. The fix is to go to \"Passwords and Encryption Keys\" under System/Preferences right click on Passwords select \"Change Password\" set it to blank for no password (useful if your system is set to auto logon) or change it to your current logon password.\nThe e-mail prompts may be some program is trying to check mail at logon.

Right click on the Password: Login put in your current password and then leave the new password blank.  This will stop this coming up also.\n\nA: I'm not quite sure but I think you should also be able to go to System -> Settings -> Password and Encryption Keys and then delete (right click on them) two of the three keyrings you should see in the list (tab Passwords).\nThis would be sort of a combined solution of Open Help's and Dean Thompson's.\n\nA: I too had several password requests after auto-login (between 3 to around 8). I just deleted my chat accounts and now it only asked once!

Will setting up dual monitors on a decent-but-not-too-powerful machine significantly slow down my system?\nFor specifics to my system, this is a 2GHz Intel Dual-core laptop with 4GB RAM and a decent integrated video card, has no problems running multiple applications with Compiz and effects. \nThe monitors in question are integrated 1366x768 laptop screen and external 1200x800 monitor, nothing fancy or outrageous. \nSo, in your experience / knowledge, will running dual-monitors significantly detriment operation speed?\n\nA: My processor's fairly old in terms of memory and processor speed my system's similar to yours (though it's not a laptop) and I use dual monitors perfectly fine. One running at 1280*1024 and another at 1440*900.\nJust a setup I've accumulated over the years but I find it handy.\nFor general desktop use it's fine, but I've never had any heavy dual monitor 3D rendering on the go (not across both anyway) though in windows I do find that because I'm only using one monitor for games the other monitor is still rendering the desktop, so when the wallpaper updates the system slows down for a few seconds... not sure wether this would still occur in a single monitor setup or not!\nKnowing windows it'd probably still swap the new wallpaper into memory even if you weren't using it!\n\nA: I would think the performance cost would be minimal and if the video card is decent like you say and the system has a decent bus speed I don't think it would an issue. \n\nA: You should check your laptop's video details before purchasing the second monitor. For some older laptops, the highest resolution they can produce is still not enough to the desktop of two monitors. I used a older Lenovo R51 and running 1024x768 on the laptop plus 1280x720 on an external monitor was too much. I had to choose either the laptop or the monitor but not both. \nAs for making the system slower, I have not experienced any major differences in performance. If you are running a 3D enabled desktop then there's more resolution to cover. In gaming, you would most likely only play on one monitor, so the performance should be the same as using a single monitor setup. I have noticed that some games run worse with two monitors and sometimes it's needed to run a game in a \"windowed\" mode.\n\nA: There's more to render so sure, a little bit more of your CPU and a little bit more of your graphics are going towards keeping the system running. But we're only talking about  a couple of CPU seconds extra per minute. Nothing that you'll notice.\nIf you run 3D things (eg games or other rendering things) over both screens, you will notice a large slowdown because you're dealing with twice the resolution and they're already CPU/GFX intensive. But if you limit them to one screen (like a window that is \"fullscreen\" on one monitor), you won't see much of a slowdown at all.\nEither way, having the extra screen will near-double your own performance so that should easily offset any slowdowns.\n\nA: With a system like yours there is very little chance you will notice much slowdown, in fact I would imagine there won't be many times such a slowdown would be noticeable.\nThe part of your system that would be very slightly taxed would be your graphics card, but if you're not an avid gamer then you're unlikely to notice.\n\nA: I've been running this setup for a while now. On recent releases of Ubuntu I've had dual screen working with Intel, Nvidia and ATI graphics. I would recommend installing the proprietary drivers for these as well.\nInternally you will create a big screen 2566x800 which will handle the dual screen's, I expect that your hardware will be able to do this. Because most of the work is done on the graphics chipset side I wouldn't expect to see any detectable slowdown in normal operations.\n\nA: The issue that i see on my 2008 Mac Mini (which i use with Logic pro X for music creation, and VideoPad for video creation and editing is not an issue with computational degradation per say, but rather a significant degradation in system responsiveness.   The reason for this in my case is due to the system design utilizing integrated graphics controller which shares its framebuffer memory out of the CPU's system memory.   The results in twice the amount of ongoing contention between the GC amd the CPU for system memory access.  Thiis additional  memory contention leads to real time deadlines being broken for apps like the ones i mention resulting (in the Logic Pro X app for example ), in glitchy audio rendering, system overload errors and other real time perceivable artifacts.   Note that if you are using an add-in graphics card solution with its own private graphics memory you won't have these same real time responsiveness isses with the second monitor.\nCheers,\nGary Solomon\nRetired Chief I/O Architect\nPC Client Group\nIntel Corp.\n", "Q: How do I disable the \"enable/disable wireless\" shortcut key on my laptop? On my Dell Studio XPS 16, I sometimes accidentally hit this key. Wireless becomes disabled, and hitting it again does not re-enable wireless. I have to hit it an odd number of times, then restart my computer to re-enable wireless.\nI can't imagine a situation in which I would want to disable wireless from my keyboard. Is it possible just disable the key all-together, so I can avoid this problem?\nOn a related note, what package do I file the bug against? I'm happy just disabling the key, but that's really just a workaround.\n\nA: On the Dell Studio XPS 1340 those buttons the wireless button was control by the bios, and could not be changed in Ubuntu.\n\nA: You should find out what wifi card there is in your machine.

I spend a lot of time at the command-line during the workday and at home too since I run Ubuntu exclusively.\nI've been using the default gnome terminal but I've reached a point where I'd really like to get my terminal tricked out so that my common tasks are as easy as possible. Specifically, I find that I spend of lot of time browsing code in the terminal and working in config files.\nOn my wish list would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ability to have multiple screens, tabs, windows (I don't have a preference at this point) that I can easily switch between.\n\n*Color coding for everything\n\n*Easy to modify the aesthetics of the terminal (is it vain to want my terminal to look nice?) such as transparency, borders, etc.\n\n\nA: One note: terminal multiplexer (tmux, screen, etc.) is not the same as terminal emulator (xterm, gnome-terminal, urxvt, etc.)\nAside from a recommendation (mine would definitely be tmux and I've switched from screen a while ago) you asked about customisations.\n\nColor coding for everything\n\nMake sure to choose a terminal that can support 256 colors. You can test if it does by downloading a simple Perl script from http://www.frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/data/256colors2.pl. chmod +x it and run it (after of course looking briefly at its code).\nAnother thing is (if you decide to use tmux) is to make sure it sets the TERM environment variable correctly. Make sure to put:\nset -g default-terminal \"screen-256color\"\n\nin your ~/.tmux.conf file.\n\nEasy to modify the aesthetics of the terminal (is it vain to want my\n  terminal to look nice?) such as transparency, borders, etc.\n\nI'm using urxvt after switching from aterm (I've used gnome-terminal, xterm and many others before). Both have support for transparency and are fast (I'm talking about being able to display a long stream of lines quickly). They're configurable with ~/.Xresources or ~/.Xdefaults.\nBorders? I think it's up to your window manager to draw those, which in turn depends on the theme you use. Good luck.\n\nA: I highly recommend Terminator.\n\nColour coding depends on the commands you use though.  grep and ls both accept --color\n\nA: I use gnome-terminal + byobu (a wrapper around screen)\n\nA: I can heartily recommend tmux.  Having come from the excellent Terminator, it took a week or two to get used to the keyboard shortcuts but I'm now fluent, and finding it much faster and much more productive than a GUI-based emulator.\n\nLike screen it runs as its own self-contained instance and it's great to be able to close the terminal window on one machine and open it via ssh on another. When I do, I find all my windows and panes where I left them. Handy.\nFor colour-coordination I'd recommend tmux-powerline.  It gives you a status line that is very pretty (and useful too :) ) and once you have it set up, you can use vim powerline which uses the same resources (see screenshot for example).\nI agree with Martin's answer regarding setting your terminal colours to screen-256color.  This setting also seems to sort out occasional display issues between tmux and mutt, for example.\n\nA: I suggest Tilda with Screen; also zsh as a shell could be a good thing!\n\nA: Besides GNU screen I would recommend tmux. It is a terminal multiplexer like GNU screen. \n\n\nA: I personally use gnome-terminal as my terminal emulator. Using gnome-terminal, I run GNU Screen (byobu to be specific) in order to work with multiple windows. You can become really efficient with it. I use GNU Screen because I often have long-lived terminal sessions that I can check on or come back to later.\ngnome-terminal running byobu\n(showing only one window open)\n\nYou seem more interested in a graphical solution for managing terminal windows. For this, I highly suggest the terminal emulator Terminator, which supports multiple windows without the need for a multiplexer like GNU Screen. You can split it horizontally and vertically as much as you like and there are even tabs. If you just feel like running lots of terminals, Terminator is really good.\nTerminator (showing multiple Terminator windows open)\n\n\nA: I like guake, which is a drop-down editor (named after the console in games like quake). You press a button and it slides down, press another button and it hides away. Press another button to make it full screen, etc. It supports transparency, tabs, color... you name it. (You could run GNU screen on the inside to get more than one visible at a time.)\nIt's on the top of this screenshot, transparently overlaid some stuff I was doing. (Click for full size.) I think it looks good.\n\n\nA: For questions about related/similar/analog software you can check nice wiki alternativeto.net\n\n", "Q: Where is stable cardapio?

Please see this link for the solution. Worked fine for me. \nI've also had problems running VMWare Player after upgrading Ubuntu from 10.4 to 10.10 as it could not recompile it's modules (due to the changes in kernel) - this guide helped to solve that issue also.\n\nA: You can add the VMware Player modules to be loaded at boot in /etc/modules. This should save the hassle of loading them manually before running VMware Player.\n", "Q: Does ubuntu tweak add ppa I know downloading softwares from ubuntu tweak usually installs the latest stable, but does it also adds the ppa of the respective software?\n\nA: The Application Center section of Ubuntu Tweak does not add PPAs, the Source Center section does.\n\nA: Nope, it only installs them. It only adds ppas when you add sources. \n", "Q: Possible problems in mixed use of apt-get, aptitude and synaptic Even though aptitude and synaptic are both front-end to the APT (and I myself\nstick only with apt-get), peculiarities in each of the available dpkg/APT\nfrontends seem to cause problems and confusions when they are used\ninterchangeably.  Beginners especially -- who tend to do copy & paste more\noften, thereby executing apt-get and aptitude commands more or less identically\n-- may find some situation puzzling.\nPlease list the possible problems that might arise when they are mixed up and\ntips to avoid when one has to rely on multiple packaging managers.\n\nA: For what I know, different package managers can have different opinions about which packages are installed automatically, or at least it was true time ago, not sure if it is yet so.\nThis can have consequences on autoremove subcommand (be aware that aptitude does not have an autoremove subcommand, but executes autoremove automatically).\nSo one can have unuseful packages hanging around, not a big problem anyway.\nAlso, they can have different opinion about which packages are blocked, but this should not be an issue for the normal user that often make no use of this feature.\nThe dependencies and conflicts resolution algorithms are more or less equivalent, so in conclusion I think the user can mix the use of different package manager without the fear of breaking something.\n\nA: apt-get and aptitude  use the same backend really.  If something is installing a package using apt-get, aptitude will be blocked and vice-versa. \naptitude is slightly better at resolving conflicts and cleaning up after itself, but it the end, if you use aptitude, synaptic, or apt-get you're performing the same task.. its just a matter of user preference.\n", "Q: Sound over HDMI not working any more after waking up from suspend So far, suspending to ram and waking up from it works. My laptop's external display (connected via HDMI) works, too.\nHowever, what doesn't work is the sound, which works before suspending, of course. I'm using my external monitor's speakers and have made the corresponding settings in Ubuntu's sound menu (switched to \"Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output + Analog Stereo Input\" in \"Hardware\" tab).\nWhat can I do to fix it?\nEdit: when I ran ubuntu-bug, it tested sound output with and without using pulse. Without pulse, it worked, however I still heard the noise. With pulse it was only noise.\nEdit: works fine with natty and oneiric now. Updating to latest Ubuntu solves the problem.\n\nA: Hardware malfunctioning after suspend sounds like a driver bug to me. ubuntu-bug -s audio\nIn the meantime, as a workaround, you can try sudo alsa force-reload to force your drivers to unload and reload (will kill all running sound apps in the process though).\n\nA: Determine which kernel module is handling HDMI audio.  On my XBMC box, it is \"snd_hda_codec_nvhdmi\", then unload that module before the laptop sleeps via a script in /etc/pm/sleep.d.  The command \"lsmod | grep hdmi\" may give you some clues.  You may have to unload more than one module for this to work properly (like \"snd\"), but if you can find the right combination, it will be just like you shutdown and rebooted each time you sleep your laptop.\nHere is what your script should look like:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Script to disable hdmi audio before suspend and restart after wake.\n\ncase \"${1}\" in\n        suspend|hibernate)\n            rmmod snd_hda_codec_nvhdmi\n            rmmod snd\n                ;;\n        resume|thaw)\n            modprobe snd\n            modprobe snd_hda_codec_nvhdmi\n                ;;\nesac\n\n\nA: Here is what works for me when HDMI sound is \"unavailable / unplugged\" after waking up\nxrandr --output HDMI-1 --auto --set \"audio\" on\n\nYMMV, adapt to your HDMI output name.\n", "Q: Many directories have a \".d\" suffix/extension. What does it mean? My system has 132 directories whose names end in .d\nThere are also two scripts whose names end in .d\nAside from the two wayward scripts (/usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d, /usr/sbin/update-rc.d), I assume that .d means directory... (but I do wonder why those scripts are so named).\nIn some cases, the .d directory's parent folder contains a file of the same name, but without the .d ending.\n# eg.\n  /etc/apt/sources.list.d\n  /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nIs there some mystical Linux rationale to this naming style?\nIs it a deeply entrenched naming convention, or is it about as absolute as 'foo' and 'bar'?\n\nA: This is often used for directories (hence the \"d\") that contain a collection of partial configuration files.  All files in the directory get combined, sometimes also with other files, to make the complete configuration.  This is often done when traditionally there was only one configuration file (e.g. in your example sources.list) but there is a desire to make things more modular later.\nAs Laurence mentions, the /etc/rc?.d directories was probably one of the first times this custom was used.\n", "Q: Repartitioned my Drive and now the Ubuntu LiveCD installer always fails to install grub! OK. I installed Ubuntu 10.04 a week or so ago over an old Ubuntu partition - no problem. Grub went on fine (it had previously been overwritten by windows).\nThen, after remembering how much I like Ubuntu and using a terminal I thought I'd upgrade to 10.10 and increase the size of my Linux partition (the ntfs partition on that drive was barely used).\nAfter doing this I continued the Ubuntu installer... all was fine until near the end when I was told that it had failed to install Grub...

I didn't actually find the need to do so. But now I am working on a software which is at the release candidate stage in the repositories but the latest stable version's source code is available at the software home page.\nI learnt that installing from source code may be difficult if the software has many dependencies. However if I tackle that, I can be happy with the latest version. But I keep wondering if such a software can automatically update itself or will I have to run some scripts to update the package. Or still worse will I have to reinstall each update from scratch?\nAlso I am eager to know if there is any specific advantage of installing from source other than the above.\n\nA: According to this post you can generate a .deb package after you compile the sources. Then instead of \"make install\", you can install from the .deb package. That makes it easier to update (if it was in a some repository) because the package will be managed by the package manager which tracks update.\nIn case for building package \"some-package\" from sources, and there are dependencies, you can try \"apt-get build-dep some-package\" to automatically install all the dependencies needed for you to compile your package, without manually tracking each dependency yourself. That way, the dependencies are also managed by the package manager and should be updated automatically as well. \n\nA: Another alternative for git users is worth mentioning:\nYou can also use git pull after an earlier git clone to update your source code and then recompile your program if desired. (You can also use git to further keep track of the files: see the answer here.)\nIf you originally used git clone to get the source code, as in, for example, \ngit clone git://github.com/person/programname.git\n\nand you retained the folder after compiling and installing, you can cd to the folder and run git pull to get the latest commits. Then remove any build directories you might have created and/or run make clean (if appropriate) and then compile the software again and install it with checkinstall, which also creates a package for you (though not suitable for distribution).\nHowever, if you are helping with development of a program and need to recompile after each daily git pull then you probably would install to the home folder, as it would be unnecessary to install to the /usr/local/ hierarchy each time.\nAs an example, if I am testing and so regularly recompiling a program, I would cd to my build folder after getting the latest commits with git pull and run (for this particular program):\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DLAYOUT=home -DPREFIX=home\n\nand then compile the debug version to test.\nHowever, if you merely wanted to compile a new version of your git cloned program every month or so (and weren't testing or debugging it) you would usually install to the /usr/local/ hierarchy with checkinstall.\n\nA: It is best to note that a software's dependencies rarely change. If you have successfully compiled the software once, any subsequent versions should be easy to compile - all dependencies should be satisfied already.\nIf you compiled from source, there is no .deb or similar package that you would be able to use to update, unless you wait for the distribution to include that software into their repositories, or wait until the developers' PPA is updated.\nSimply put, someone has to compile it first to make it into a deb. Compiling an old version would not give you the ability to update automatically, you still have to go through the whole \"download-configure-compile-install\" process.\nHowever, if you want to install the same version on multiple computers, it would make sense to package your compiled version as a .deb (or similar) and distribute it to those computers. If done right, the dependencies would be pulled into automatically.\nAs to the advantages of installing from source, the only two I can think of are:\n\n\n*\n\n*You get access to the latest revision of the code, and you have a choice of a stable version or the cutting-edge version (usually called nightly builds, latest revision, etc.)\n\n*Ubuntu/other-distribution might not want to include the software into their repositories. In that case, you're stuck with the source code or packages provided by the developers or the community. That is, you have no choice but to use the sources.\n\n\nA: To manage your installations from source, please see my answer here: How to update packages compiled from source?\n", "Q: Is there any guarantee that software from Launchpad PPAs is free from viruses and backdoor threats? As Linux continues to grow and develop, and the more we use Linux, the greater the threat from viruses.\nWe also know that a virus/threat in Linux (if any) would have difficulty running or spreading when it is running as a normal user, but it is a different story if the virus/threat is running as the root user. \nAn example of this danger would be if a virus is tucked inside a PPA (intentionally or unintentionally) or if an application has an intentionally planted backdoor (e.g., pidgin could secretly send passwords to a particular address).\nIf we add software from a Launchpad PPA, is there any guarantee that software is from free viruses/backdoor threats?\n\nA: Establishing a (perhaps distributed) mechanism of trust ratings for PPAs has been on the USC roadmap for a while, but it hasn't been implemented yet.\n\nA: There is never any guarantee but in a community backed environment, we thrive on \"belief\". I've added atleast 20 PPAs to my sources and never experienced a problem until now. If,by any chance and as you mentioned, a threat/virus/backdoor is planted on my system by a PPA, I'd come to know about it somehow, courtesy of the community and simply remove it. And BTW, before adding a PPA, I always check what packages are listed in it.\nPS: Pidgin never sends usernames and passwords to the servers (and never to a third party!) \"secretly\". Everything is done with the user's consent. In order to keep you connected seamlessly, Pidgin cannot ping you everytime it sends the login credentials to the servers. It is expected that you have authorised it to do so, once you have provided it the details. I'd rather think twice before calling Pidgin a \"backdoor\". :)\n\nA: Every package's install script has root access to your system, so the mere act of adding a PPA or installing a package from one is an implicit statement of trust on your part of the PPA owner.\nSo, what happens if your trust is misplaced and a PPA owner wants to be naughty?\nIn order to upload to a PPA, a package must be signed by a GPG key unique to the launchpad user (indeed, the same key they signed the code of conduct with).  So in the case of a known malicious PPA we would simply ban the account and shut down the PPA (affected systems would still be compromised, but there's no good way fix them at that point anyway).\nTo some extent Launchpad's social features can be used as a bit of a preventative measure of bad users -- someone who has a history of contributing to Ubuntu and some established Launchpad karma, for instance, is less likely to be setting up a trap PPA.\nOr what if someone gains control of a PPA that isn't theirs?\nWell, this is a bit tougher of a threat scenario, but also less likely since it requires an attacker getting both the launchpad users's private key file (generally only on their computer) as well as the unlock code for it (generally a strong password not used for anything else).  If this happens, though, it's usually fairly simple for someone to figure out their account has been compromised (Launchpad will for instance email them about the packages they're not uploading), and the cleanup procedure would be the same.\nSo, in sum, PPAs are a possible vector for malicious software, but there are probably much easier methods for attackers to come after you.\n", "Q: Is the bug about kernels increasing temperature fixed? I've read about a bug in the first versions of kernel 2.6.35 that causes the temperature to increase above the normal. Does anyone knows if it is already corrected?\n\nA: It seems there is a bug in the kernel, according to this lauchpad bug. People are seeing this a lot, although they say the temperature feels the same. It is probably a bug that should be fixed soon. You don't have to worry about it. If you update your ubuntu installation a feel the machine is getting hotter, not just what is said by the lm sensors, than you could downgrade the kernel to a \"safer\" version.\n\nA: You may be talking about this issue: http://smackerelofopinion.blogspot.com/2010/09/sensors-reporting-hot-cpu-in-maverick.html\nThe takeaway is that it may just be a change in how the temperature is reported, not an actual change in how hot the system is.  To test if this is so, see if the output of:\ncat /sys/devices/platform/coretemp*/temp1_crit\n\nhas changed from 10.04 to 10.10. If so, your system will report hotter temperatures, but it will not actually be running hotter.\n", "Q: Recover partition in / which is umounted I have a partition /data which supposed to store data and its format is ext4.

Eventually I decide to umount it.\nAfter that, I always get the prompt /data is not mounted. Press S to skip, or press M to manually recover at booting screen. It is a bit annoying to me. If I manually recover by mount command, I can see /data visible but for just only that time. The next time the message appear again.\nAnyone give me some suggestions? \nThanks.\nBTW, how could I change the partition format from ext4 to FAT? I am using Ubuntu 10.04.\n\nA: Try running fsck -n /data (after it is mounted), and note if there are any errors present. If you want to fix them, re-run it without the -n flag.\nTo format it to FAT32, you will have to copy your files from /data elsewhere, something like ~/data is a good idea (~ is the home directory, make sure there is enough space). Then fire up the Disk Utility (located under System->Administration menu), select the /data partition and format it as FAT32.\nAlternatively, if you want to keep ext4, and make it user-writeable, you can run sudo chown USERNAME:users /data -R.\n", "Q: Share Internet Connection With Symbian device, no, not the other way around I do not have data on my phone, and I was wondering if anyone out there knew how I would go about sharing my laptop's internet connection with my Symbian s60v5fp3 phone.

Usually in Gnome and KDE it is only possible to define shortcuts with the Super key in combination with another key. But is it possible to use only the Super key as a shortcut, and how could I achieve this?\n\nA: Yes, you can. You can fill with Super_L to the shortcut you want, for example to use win key only for launching gnome menu :\nopen terminal, type : \n\ngconftool-2 –set\n  /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/panel_main_menu\n  –type string “Super_L”\n\nThe gnome menu will lauch with windows key only.\n\nA: The Super key is a so-called modifier key, i.e., it is only meaningful in combination with some other key (it \"modifies\" the other key to report Super+key instead of just key).  This makes it impossible to bind it to a shortcut with the System->Preferences->Keyboard shortcuts GUI without a tweak.\nYou can tell the system to not consider Super a modifier key any longer; then you will be able to map it to any shortcut you want.\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal, type the command xmodmap; it will output a few lines -- look for the one that has Super_L and Super_R in it. It should look like this:\nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce)\n\nSee the mod4 at the beginning of the line? That means that Super_L and Super_R (left- and right- Super keys) are bound to the 4th modifier (there are 8 in total).\n\n*If you want to be able to bind the Super_R key,  give the command (note the quotes!):\nxmodmap -e 'remove mod4 = Super_R'\n\nThis tells X11 that right-Super should no longer be a modifier.\nNote: These settings will not survive a reboot; you can make them permanent\nby creating a text file .Xmodmap in your home directory, and writing a single\nline to it:\n remove mod4 = Super_R\n\n", "Q: How can I have Rhythmbox download album art for tracks? I can't seem to find an inbuilt way to have Rhythmbox fetch album art for tracks -- stock plugins also don't help. Is there any external package that could do that, or am I maybe missing something?\n\nA: AlbumArtSearch is a third party plug in for Rhythmbox that will search for and download the cover art for the currently playing track. Unfortunately, it doesn't run in the background automatically, though the fact that you can refine searches makes sure you get the covers that you are actually looking for.\nFirst install the two dependencies:\nsudo apt-get install python-webkit python-mako\nNext download the plugin. You can get it at the link above or run:\nwget http://albumartsearch.googlecode.com/files/albumartsearch_0.2.tar.gz\nFinally you need to extract it in the folder ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins This can be done with Nautilus or by running these commands:\nmkdir -p  ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins\ntar -xvf albumartsearch_0.2.tar.gz -C ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins\n\n\n\nA: You need to install the rhythmbox-plugins package then enable the 'Cover Art' plugin in Edit>Plugins:\n\nNow, when you rip your CDs, the album art will be added automatically.\n\nA: Out of the box, rhythmbox has the ability to extract coverart from art embedded within tracks themselves (for example mp3 files), or from MusicBrainz & LastFM websites.\nFor the coverart to appear you need to play a track and then the Coverart Plugin takes over and fetches the artwork.\nThere are a few issues with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*you have to play each track individually to download coverart\n\n*you have no control over where the coverart is downloaded.\n\n\nFrom Rhythmbox v2.97 and above you can manually change coverart by dragging and dropping covers onto the coverart area.  I've explained this approach in this Q&A:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change or delete the album cover image shown in rhythmbox?\n\nThe rhythmbox coverart browser makes downloading covers very simple.\nFirst - you can select multiple albums or all albums and the plugin will download all the covers for you automatically i.e. you dont need to play individual tracks (but you can also continue doing this as well if you so wish):\n\nYou can manually update all Rhythmbox versions since RB2.96 using the inbuilt Google powered cover finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nFurther more, you have the ability to tailor where you want coverart to be downloaded from - and there are more providers possible than the default rhythmbox coverplugin:\n\nAll covers downloaded by the coverart browser plugin are visible also through the coverart icon shown in the toolbar.\nSee the installation instructions described in the links below.\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to browse by album art in rhythmbox?\n\n*How do I install third-party rhythmbox plugins?\n\nA: It would be useful to know what version of Ubuntu you are using. I use Ubuntu 10.04. In my Rhythmbox the cover art wasn't shown, too. But in the Plugins dialog there is a cover plugin. Initially it was checked. I unchecked it and checked it again.

I also tried nvclock, but as it has't been updated since January, 4th, 2009, it doesn't work with my card.\nIn windows, the driver itself ships with the ability to overclock the cards, but nvidia appears to have left this out of the linux drivers.  Has anyone discovered a solution?  Or would it be possible to stage the windows drivers within Ubuntu? (ick)\nIf there is a more appropriate forum to ask this question in, I'd be happy to do so -- but I'm hoping for a solution within Ubuntu.  Thanks!\nUpdate: It appears that I may need to have \"Coolbit\" \"5\" as discussed here.  Hmm.  Nope.\nHere is the relevant section of my xorg.conf file:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GTX 460\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:2:0:0\"\n    Option         \"Coolbits\" \"5\"\n    Option         \"NoLogo\" \"True\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device1\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GTX 480\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:3:0:0\"\n    Option         \"Coolbits\" \"5\"\n    Option         \"NoLogo\" \"True\"\nEndSection\n\nWhen I restart with Coolbits set to 5, I can enable fan control on GTX 460.  I can also set it to maximum performance mode.  I cannot change the clock frequencies.  I am about to try different levels.  But here is what I see (with Coolbits = 5):\n\nUpdate 2: I've tried driver version - 260.24(beta - nvdeveloper) & 260.19.12 (released today).  I am not able to see the \"Clock Frequencies\" tab for any of the 4xx cards.  I can however alter the fan speed for the card with a display attached.  I'm  going to ask a second question and wait for better drivers to be released.\n\nA: 2018 Answer\nTo enable overclocking, run:\nnvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=28\n\nReboot your PC. Now you can do things like:\n# List all GPUs\n# Set power to 100W, +1000 Mhz Mem clock offset, and +100 Mhz on GPU clock offset.\nnvidia-settings -c :0 -q gpus\nnvidia-smi -i 0 -pl 100\nnvidia-settings -c :0 -a '[gpu:0]/GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset[2]=1000'\nnvidia-settings -c :0 -a '[gpu:0]/GPUGraphicsClockOffset[2]=100'\n\nThe adventage of this method is that you can change the power input. Potential harm risk. Proceed with careful.

You'll know they were applied because some text will appear in the bottom left side saying that the value was set\nYou should also note that the options are now nested in PowerMizer and look different than Screencapped here\nThis method also works for Ubuntu version 21.04\n\nA: There are also the following tools in the default Ubuntu repositories that you can install from the Software Center or from the terminal:\nNVIDIA - for Ubuntu <=14.04\nnvclock - Allows you to overclock Nvidia cards\nnvclock-gtk - Nvclock but with GTK support\nnvclock-qt - Nvclock but with QT support\nATI - for all currently supported versions of Ubuntu\nrovclock - Allows you to overclock ATI cards\n\nA: You almost had it.

Maybe a non-geek that knows of the existence of a firewall is already some kind of a nerd. If you have been a windows-user then it was rather easy to set up a firewall (I don't know if it was a good one!): enable a firewall with maximum protection. Then for each program that tried to make an internet-connection a notification was shown (allow or not allow). In this way without any prior knowledge of protocols and ports a user could set up a firewall that was suited to his needs. Is there any equivalent program in Ubuntu so that any user can set up a proper firewall?\n\nA: gufw\ngufw is an easy and intuitive way to manage your Linux firewall.

Background: I have never used Rhythmbox on this computer.\nI just accidentally opened Rhythmbox while my MP3 player was plugged in.

I exited the program to stop it, but not before it reached about 30% completion.\nWhat did it just do?\nI cannot find any documentation of this behavior on the Rhythmbox website or the Ubuntu Community Documentation.\n\nUpdate: It occurred to me that the IO activity I saw on my home folder might just be coincidental, if Rhythmbox defaults to scanning my home folder when it is first run.

If it's relevant, I do not have Music folder in my home folder.\n\nA: I don't think that Rhythmbox copies music files from MP3-players if the user hasn't told it to do so.\nWhat you saw was Rhythmbox scanning your Music folder. It is default behaviour of Rhythmbox to watch that directory and make sure all music files in that directory are in its music library. It doesn't move or remove or import any music files, it just adds files in your Music folder to the library, so you can play the songs through Rhythmbox.\n\nA: It copies the music off of your MP3 player into your music directory in your Home folder.\n", "Q: DenyHosts SERVER_SYNC option, call for anecdotal reports I'm securing my ssh server with DenyHosts, and decided to dig into DenyHosts' configuration to make sure things looked good.

This might be a rubbish question for AskUbuntu but I'm getting a hardware itch and I think the cheapest way to alleviate it is by chucking another Nvidia GTX 260 in my box and strapping it to my existing one...\nBut I use Twinview (that is two monitors coming out my one card) showing a single screen. I also use Compiz and I also play games, and watch video using VDPAU.\nSo before I spend £100 on another card, I'd like to know what I'm getting myself in for. Does twinview work with SLI? Does 3D performance increase as much as it does in Windows? Where's Wally? Should I just forget it for now and buy a mid-range 5xx in a year or so?\n\nA: Well I found this post: http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=153283\nAnd the people there are somewhat less than happy with SLI performance on Linux. Some of the posts are quite recent and there's no sign of performance being any better than single-card mode.\nI guess I'll keep my eye on the driver releases to see if nvidia improve things.\n\nA: I realise that it is too late to provide a useful answer to your question but I will post this anyway, for future googlers to find:\nSLI is NOT compatible with twinview. It says so in nvidia's driver documentation. There are two alternative options though:\n1) Set up each screen as a separate xscreen - the disadvantage being that you won't be able to drag windows from one screen to the other. The nvidia control panel can be used to set this up.\n2) Use a utility to convince the xserver that your two smaller screens are, in fact, one big one. This will cause applications to not full screen correctly, however. I'm afraid I don't know what this utility is called.\n\nA: It should work\nNVidia's Linux drivers are generally quite good. Their hardware is used in high-performance-computing a lot, which is why Linux support (now) is rather excellent. Of course you may even see decreased performance on some applications. But this isn't exclusive to Linux. Just game developers on Windows doing a good job of optimising for SLI. \nMaybe somebody who knows a bit more about hardware could advise you whether the GTS 450 mightn't be a better deal. (Don't laugh at me if that's ridiculous...)\n\nA: I think this is for the Windows driver set, but I hope it can be used also to configure Linux TwinView with SLI: http://www.slizone.com/object/sli_multi_monitor.html\n", "Q: How can I run a fake X server & link it to a specific GPU? On this page the final post mentions Xvfb as a way to run a fake Xserver.\nIs it possible to tie this directly to a specific card as if a display was attached??\nSpecifically, I'd like to overclock my gpus, but short of that (since the Clock Frequencies tab won't make an appearance), I'd like to at least crank up the fan so that my CUDA kernels can run on a cooler gpu.  To do so within the driver framework, a display must be attached to the card.  But if I do that, then I can't set the card to \"Compute Exclusive\" mode.\nBasically, does anyone know of a way to attach a fake (software based) display to a specific gpu in Ubuntu?\n\nA: You should ask Nvidia for overclocking support outside the X driver (e.g. in that nvidia-smi tool).\nUsing a graphics driver that is not for your GPU is not useful, as it doesn't know anything about the hardware, and nvidia-settings only knows about the nvidia driver.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for pasting the primary selection Is there a standard or conventional keyboard shortcut for pasting the primary selection?\nI'd like to select some text and go to another app to paste without trashing my clipboard contents.  I'd rather keep my fingers on the keyboard than move to the mouse, find the pointer, position it where I want, and middle-click.\nIf there's nothing conventional, or if it's application-specific and unsupported by many, is there a workaround to get this working globally? (Or at least in more applications.)\n\nA: You can get this with the combined use of the programs\nxdotool \n(click to install) and \nxsel\n(click to install).\nxdotool can simulate typing into a window; xsel outputs the\ncontents of the PRIMARY selection (by default); the following shell\none liner will do the trick:\n xdotool type `xsel`\n\nTo bind this to any key using the System->Preferences->Keyboard\nshortcuts menu item it is necessary to wrap it in a shell invocation:\n sh -c 'xdotool type --clearmodifiers -- \"`xsel`\"'\n\nTyping in xdotool will not work with some programs; see the notes in\nthe xdotool documentation.\n\nA: Calling xdotool click --clearmodifiers 2 simulates clicking middle mouse button. This works much better than using xsel (at least for me). Altough you have to position your mouse before typing...\n\nA: Sending virtual keypresses doesn't work for me (see comments), but that answer inspired me to look for similar solutions.  Sending a \"text\" event with xvkbd ignores the current state of your physical keyboard:\nsh -c 'xsel | xvkbd -xsendevent -file - 2>/dev/null'\n\nxvkbd -text uses a few backslash sequences, so rather than dance with escaping, -file works. Add -delay 0 to enter the text without delay between the “keystrokes”. xvkbd also outputs some warning text about modifiers, but it appears to be irrelevant to this use (but I didn't want to see it in ~/.xsession-errors).\nI bound this to a shortcut using System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts.\nNote that you need to have xsel and xvkbd packages installed:\nsudo apt-get install xsel xvkbd\n\n\nA: Another xdotool suggestion, working in Debian Jessie 8.7 (Jan 2017):\nxdotool click --delay 0 --clearmodifiers 2\n\n\n\n*\n\n*xdotool handles multi-byte strings (p.e. UTF-8), unlike xvkbd.\n\n*xdotool click simulates an actual click, so you don't have to click yourself to paste at mouse position, as you would have if you used xdotool type, or xvkbd.\n\n\nThe only problem is that --clearmodifiers will \"press\" back any modifier (Ctrl/Alt/Shift/Meta) you use after simulating the click.  Even with --delay 0 (instead of 12ms), the command takes a little to execute.  If you release the keys before it ends, your modifiers will be \"pressed\" again, and stuck there until you press and release the actual key once more.\nSo with this you have to be a bit \"slow\" (50ms?) to release your modifiers, if you're using any.\nYou can test this by setting up your keyboard shortcut, using it into a text editor, and then pressing a key (like a, or an arrow).  The letter should appear in lowercase.  If something else happens, you are too fast and a modifier is stuck (p.e. Shift if it's in caps, Ctrl if you selected all text, Alt if you opened a menu).  Press and release your modifiers again to reset them.\nIf you're too fast, you can use ilkerk's suggestion:\nsh -c 'sleep 0.3 && xdotool type --clearmodifiers --delay 0  \"`xsel`\"'\n\nThen you have to release them in less than 300ms, and wait half a second for the text to appear.  \nAlso, using xdotool type means you insert the text as if you where typing, at the text cursor position, and not the mouse pointer.  You can change it to click if you prefer the usual middle-click behaviour.\n(made this post so newcomers don't have to piece the puzzle pieces spread in the comments again)\n\nA: I had problems with the solutions that simulate pasting the PRIMARY selection, so instead I added a shortcut that copies the PRIMARY selection to the CLIPBOARD. After using my shortcut I paste the CLIPBOARD in the usual way, with Ctrl+V, Ctrl+Shift+V, or Shift+Insert, depending on the application.\nThe command to copy the PRIMARY selection to the CLIPBOARD is\nsh -c 'xsel --output --primary | xsel --input --cliboard'\n\nwhich I bind to Ctrl+Insert (arbitrary choice) in the Gnome shortcut settings under System Settings -> Devices -> Keyboard\nSummary of problems with other solutions: I tried the xsel | xvkbd ... and xsel | xdotool ... solutions, but found they didn't work very well because they simulate typing the PRIMARY selection character by character, which is not the same as pasting it with middle click. Problems include: there's a long delay while a large selection gets inserted one character at a time; if you want to undo the \"paste\", you have to undo it character by character, which is slow; if you're using \"dead keys\" then everything gets messed up, e.g. \"pasting\" \"e produces ë; the xvkdb doesn't handle unicode characters correctly.\nWarning: This solution overwrites the existing CLIPBOARD contents, but the OP asked for solutions that preserve the existing CLIPBOARD contents.\n\nA: I was looking for an answer for this very same question, and I found this answer that says that Shift+Insert is working to paste the primary selection. I works for me. Simpler.\n\nA: I had the same issue and internet search didn't help me much. \nThe problem simulating click 2 is annoying as OP mentioned. \nThe problem with the above proposed xdotool and xsel is when xdotool starts \"typing\" you are still pressing another key. That does not always result with any output. For example if you bind it to \"insert\" key then xdotool is sending keys while your finger is pressing \"insert\" key which causes nothing. \nBelow is a workaround, to bind it to a key press : \nsh -c 'sleep 0.3 && xdotool type --clearmodifiers --delay 0  \"`xsel`\"'\n\nit is not perfect but working. now you have 0.3 seconds to finish your selection of key press (and key up).\n\nA: You can also use xclip\nCopy the content of primary to clipboard using the following command:\nsh -c 'xclip -o -selection primary | xclip -selection clipboard'\n\nYou can bind this command to any keyboard shortcut of your preference. If you are using Gnome desktop environment you can do it by going to Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts or search for keyboard shortcuts in case of other DE.\nNow, you can paste the content in the usual way by Ctrl-v or Ctrl-Shift-v.\nHOWEVER This will overwrite the previous content of your clipboard!\n\nA: In KDE on Debian Bullseye the default key combo seems to be Ctrl+Shift+Insert.\n", "Q: K9-like program that blocks websites? In windows there is a very good program which block inappropriate sites\ncalled K9 web protection I was wondering is there a program like that or a good option to block inappropriate sites?\n\nA: The answers to this question might help you.\n\nA: It's not Ubuntu specific, but another option is setting your DNS server to OpenDNS with settings to block inappropriate sites.

Once you start it up, go to Edit -> Preferences and edit the format, quality and output folder as you need:\n\nYou can then close the preferences window and use the main interface to add your music folders (normally just ~/Music).\n\nOnce it has finished loading the music, you can press the 'Convert' button and it will convert all of the listed files, putting the output files into the folder you chose in Preferences.\nIt is a simple program, and doesn't have the 'watch folder' functionality, but is good for one off transcodings. When you get new music, you can convert just those files/folders.\n\nA: Rhythmbox already has this functionality. All you need to do in order to use it is to describe your device for Rhythmbox to know its capabilities. Quote from https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox/FAQ :\nCreate a .is_audio_player file on the device. You can set a few fields in this file to override the media-player-info device information like this:\naudio_folders=MUSIC/,RECORDINGS/\nfolder_depth=2\noutput_formats=application/ogg,audio/x-ms-wma,audio/mpeg\n\nDescribe where the music is stored on the device as well as which formats it is capable of playing and Rhythmbox will transfer everything compatible directly and transcode everything incompatible. :)\n\nA: Amarok tries to tell what your media player can play, and if it can't handle what you are trying to put onto it, it transcodes them before transferring them to it.\nBanshee also can do this, but I have never had any experience with it. You can, however, choose what codec it transcodes into by going to Edit > Preferences > Encoding.\nIn terms of scripting, you could make a bash, or similar, script that would do the exact functionality using a number of tools, however I don't know about media player built-in functionality.\n", "Q: Which is the preferred environment to start hacking unity?

Search google for \"tiling window manager\", or search for \"tiling\" in synaptic.\n\nA: There is also an unsupported compiz plugin called Tile.\nIt's in the compiz-fusion-plugins-unsupported package which can be obtained e.g. from this PPA (update of compiz from this ppa needed too)\nYou can watch it in action in this video (starting at 1:44)\n\nA: X Tile\n\nX-tile is an application that allows you to select a number of windows and tile them in different ways.\nX-tile works on any X desktop (gnome, kde, xfce, lxde…).\nThe main features are: many tiling geometries, undo tiling, invert tiling order, optional system tray docking and menu, filter to avoid listing some windows, filter to check some windows by default, command line interface.\n\n\nA: If you're using compiz, you can enable the \"Grid\" plugin to use keyboard shortcuts to move windows around the screen in a tiling sort of way.\nYou'll need to make sure compiz-fusion-plugins-extra is installed (sudo apt-get install compiz-fusion-plugins-extra or use synaptic - probably software center too).\nI got the tip from here: http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/linux-w-compiz-tile-position-and-resize.html\nYou can do something similar without compiz using this: https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/08/python-window-organizer-organize-your-windows-using-the-keyboard\nI don't think either of these options have an auto tile feature though. Using a default install, I'm not sure this option is anywhere (not anywhere that I know of anyway). In that case, some of the other answers already posted might be more useful.\n\nA: How-to: Set up XMonad & XMobar on Ubuntu\nhttp://www.huntlycameron.co.uk/2010/11/how-to-set-up-xmonad-xmobar-ubuntu/\n\nA: Having looked at all the answers above, the answer (without either completely dumping your existing Window Manager) seems to be \"You can't\".\n\n*\n\n*xMonad is a completely different Window Manager to the one you're probably using\n\n*the compiz plugins all seem to be out of date\n\n*as are most of the other answers\n\nThe only sensible option seems to be https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-windows-tiled.html which isn't quite automatic but seems to be as good as it gets.\n\nA: I think you can use wmtile for your case: http://ostatic.com/wmtile/home/1\n\nA: You can use Super(Win)+W with lastest Ubuntu. Press and hold Super button, you will see the hotkey tutorial\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu use Pulseaudio? I'm not here to criticize pulseaudio, but I find it immature and unnecessary. It eats system resources, causes confusions, and complicates the system by adding an extra layer\nwithout seemingly clear benefits, and I'm not the only one who thinks this\nway. (In fact, for more \"real\" complaints, refer to this link:\nhttp://amplicate.com/hate/pulseaudio )\nWhy does Ubuntu come with Pulseaudio as its sound server in the first place?\nIs there any good alternatives to this as of today?\n\nA: Here's a good resource for using ALSA/OSS instead of PulseAudio: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/03/how-to-switch-to-alsa-or-oss-instead-of.html\nAs to \"why\" they chose pulseaudio as the default, I don't know. It probably has to do with a lot of the same reason why they switched to Empathy as the default IM client. Those reasons (at least as far as I know) are related to the framework used in the backend. PulseAudio has a very good backend even if the implementation isn't 100% yet. Same as Empathy, the backend is awesome and super flexible, but Empathy isn't quite as feature rich as Pidgin. It's a forward looking decision I believe.\nWhether it was a good decision or not is up for debate.\n\nA: Here is the WIKI page that will make you understand why Ubuntu switched to Pulseaudio.\n", "Q: Do I need to re-purchase software in the Ubuntu Software Centre if I reinstall? I want to purchase the Fluendo DVD player using the Ubuntu Software Centre.

Ever since I installed 10.10, the network applet stays with a red exclamation point for about 10 seconds. I don't know why this is happening. Please help me, this is very annoying! I didn't have this problem when I was with 10.04.\nEDIT: I should maybe mention the indicator appears, but it says that there are no network available. Only after the aforementioned 10-15 seconds does it detect all the networks.\nEDIT 2: This question is not answered! I have tried with another computer, and the network manager is already loaded upon login, so I know it's a bug. Please help!\nEDIT 3: I have the same problem with my power indicator, actually...\nEDIT 4: The problem is back once again. I have counted: it takes a full 15 seconds to load after my desktop.\nEDIT 5: I have filed a bug report in Launchpad here. Can ANYONE help me?\nEDIT 6: Still nobody?\n\nA: I believe this may be an inadvertent feature of Ubuntu 10.10 by where the loading of the wireless driver is done after the GUI to decrease bootup time. If you'd prefer you can think of it as either everything takes 30 seconds to startup, or the GUI appears in 20 secs and the wireless comes 10 secs afterwards. Hope that helps!\n\nA: Just thinking aloud here:\n1. Try changing the security options in the WP. Set it to access without asking a password. See if that speeds things up.\n2. If the same things worked with Lucid, then I think that the drivers are at fault.\nPS: I dont know anything about the development of the drivers, I am just a n00b.\nEDIT: I was looking around the conf files, and saw an option in another file, that might be of use here.\nat a terminal type the following\nsudo cp /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop.backup\ngksudo gedit /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop\nAdd a line \nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=10\nI hope that helps.\n\nA: The network manager used by Ubuntu is flawed. KDE's network manager (would be Kubuntu or so) can use various backends like wicd, which is what I recommend to do: remove the network-manager (search related packages with Synaptic and remove them all) and install wicd.\nThis error is well known, often reported on Launchpad and constantly ignored by the Ubuntu developers. They used a specifically patched version (I think they wanted to integrate some of the Ubuntu One/Social Gwibber stuff into one Gnome Applet). Anyhow... it's not useable.\n\nA: Avoid the issue, try another network manager eg wicd!\n", "Q: Is it worth paying for Crossover Games or Cedega? I have had Crossover Games (also called CX Games) recommended to me as a time-saver for installing Windows-native games on Linux. I have also come across another package called Cedega. These apps make it easier to run games by supplying the correct Wine settings, and in the case of Cedega, actually making changes to the compatibility layer (I.e. it does not simply use Wine as a back-end).\nCedega charges an ongoing subscription fee, which really rubs me up the wrong way, whereas CX Games is a one-off payment which entitles you to any future upgrades (please correct me if I'm wrong on that point).\nIf you have used these packages, did they save you time / headaches getting games running, could you run games which were impossible / very hard to run straight through wine?\nEDIT: As pointed out by JanC PlayOnLinux is also available, a free front-end for Wine which includes some profiles for games. I was unfairly mentally lumping this in with Wine.\n\nA: Paying for CrossOver Games can save you some hassle and support the Wine project.\nCrossOver is the commercial sponsor of the Wine project. It builds upon its technology to provide user-friendly compatibility for Windows games.\nCedega is TransGaming's product which was derived from Wine many years ago and has parted its way with Wine long ago. They do not contribute to Wine and their codebase lacks a lot of the features that Wine and CrossOver have currently. I have noticed that as of sometime Cedega has stalled and they forecast on their Mac solution but I may be wrong.\nSo all in all - I would say that using Wine or CrossOver Games will give you better results than Cedega and if you opt for CrossOver you will not only help yourself but the Wine project.\n\nA: wine + winetricks + wibom + (eventually) playonlinux\nIf something doesn't work with that combination and a little search and tweak in google or winehq, it won't work in crossover or cedega... so i'd say no.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I would say, no. There is already enough documentation for each game, and the most well-known games will work well by default anyway. As said in your edit, PlayOnLinux works, so you could try that. \nI don't know about CXGames, but if you really want to you could try it: there's a trial on the download page. Give it a shot and see if it's worth it, and try to do the same on Wine without it.\n", "Q: About the architecture of Virtual-Machine System information:\nUbuntu SMP Thu Sep 16 16:05:42 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nVirtual Marchine:\nVirtualBox 3.1.6_OSE r59338 linux.amd64\n\nI wanna to install a virtual system with x86-64 in Virtual Box,But it seemed that it is impossible to do this.\nThe virtual machine tips me it only detected an i686 CPU.\nIs there any link between the architecture of host and that of the client virtual OS?\nkvm-okresult:\nINFO: Your CPU supports KVM extensions\nINFO: /dev/kvm does not exist\nHINT: sudo modprobe kvm_amd\nKVM acceleration can NOT be used\n\nsudo modprobe kvm_amdresult\nFATAL: Error inserting kvm_amd (/lib/modules/2.6.32-24-server/kernel/arch/x86/kvm/kvm-amd.ko): Operation not supported\n\nkvm-okagain:\nINFO: Your CPU supports KVM extensions\nINFO: KVM is disabled by your BIOS\nHINT: Enter your BIOS setup and enable Virtualization Technology (VT),  and then hard poweroff/poweron your system\nKVM acceleration can NOT be used\n\nBut another problem happened,the VirtualBox displayed an error windows.:\nVT-x/AMD-V hardware-acceleration has been enabled,but it is in the ineffective status.

I'm running a 64bit virtual machine on a 32bit Ubuntu with VMware Player without configuring anything. It seems to me that there is  some issue with your VirtualBox. You are trying to install a 64bit client on a 64bit host using a 64bit VirtualBox, so it shouldn't give that error.\n", "Q: How can I remove \"Set Up Mail\" and other entries from the message indicator? Is there any other way of removing the \"Set Up Mail\" and other entries from the message indicator short of uninstalling Evolution?  I prefer to use GMail directly through the browser. It's beginning to annoy me since I keep on clicking it by accident then that window pops out.\n\nA: Note: as per Ted and pydave's comments, my original answer below is not the ideal solution. Refer to the other answers for better solutions.\nRemoving an item from /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications should remove its corresponding application from the messaging indicator. It should take effect the next time you log in.\n\nA: To remove the Set Up Mail... ( or Chat, Broadcast etc.) item for just your user account, simply run the following commands (replacing evolution with gwibber,empathy etc.):\nThis creates a folder that the Messaging Menu looks into for applications to not show:  \nmkdir ~/.config/indicators/messages/applications-blacklist/ -p\n\nNow, to \"blacklist\" an item from the Messaging Menu:\ncp /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications/evolution ~/.config/indicators/messages/applications-blacklist/\n\nThis has the same effect as removing evolution from /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications but it will only affect your user. Also, it takes effect immediately, you don't need to log out or restart the panel.\nIf for any reason you want to re-enable Set Up Mail, simply remove the file  ~/.config/indicators/messages/applications-blacklist/evolution\n\nA: You can remove the evolution-indicator package and Evolution won't show up in the Messaging Indicator anymore.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Eating My Dropbox I used to have a perfectly good working DropBox account on my Ubuntu 10.04 LTS computer. Somewhere along the chain of \"sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade\" over the past year, my DropBox suddenly stopped working. Instead, I see Ubuntu One stuff on the menus in Nautilus instead of DropBox.\nSo, I did \"apt-get --purge remove nautilus-dropbox\", and then went to DropBox.com to download the deb file and reinstall it again.\nBut no dice. I get the DropBox icon in my \"systray\", and clicking it opens ~/Dropbox folder, but it does not sync with DropBox and rightclicking Nautilus does not show me menu items for Dropbox. Instead, I see items for Ubuntu One sharing.\nI like Ubuntu One really only for the music purchasing because I am guessing that it helps Canonical.com pay Ubuntu's light bills. But I'm not interested in anything else with Ubuntu One besides that -- not interested in Ubuntu One offsite file storage. I really just want my Dropbox sync with Nautilus to start working again.\nHow do I fix this back so that Dropbox syncs with Nautilus again?\n\nA: I'm not sure exactly what you're seeing, here; we don't do anything that would interfere with Dropbox in any way.\n\nA: You need to issue a dropbox start or possibly a dropbox start -i, it seems as though your daemon is not running.\nIt will automatically do everything for you, and nautilus extension will be enabled once the daemon starts.\n", "Q: Why is ksoftirqd/0 process using all of my CPU? I was feeling Ubuntu was running a bit sluggish, and then I went to see the processes running on it, and found one which was using something like 50% of CPU called ksoftirqd/0. \nDoes anyone know what this process does, why it is using so much CPU and how to make it less CPU-intensive?\n\nA: Your computer communicates with the devices attached to it through IRQs (interrupt requests). When an interrupt comes from a device, the operating system pauses what it was doing and starts addressing that interrupt.\nIn some situations IRQs come very very fast one after the other and the operating system cannot finish servicing one before another one arrives. This can happen when a high speed network card receives a very large number of packets in a short time frame.\nBecause the operating system cannot handle IRQs as they arrive (because they arrive too fast one after the other), the operating system queues them for later processing by a special internal process named ksoftirqd.\nIf ksoftirqd is taking more than a tiny percentage of CPU time, this indicates the machine is under heavy interrupt load.\n\nA: ksoftirqd  is  a  per-cpu  kernel  thread that runs when the machine is under heavy soft-interrupt load.So, it is not eating your cpu but rather reducing your IRQ load.\n\nA: From the man page, ksoftirqd is a per-cpu kernel thread that runs when the machine is under heavy soft-interrupt load.\nYou can tweak the settings a bit, by defining which cpu picks up a certain interrupt. You do this by changing the contents of /proc/irq/$interrupt_number/smp_affinity. You can get a list of interrupts and their meaning by doing:\ncat /proc/interrupts\n\nThe number in smp_affinity is a bitmap of cpus, represented in hex code. The rightmost bit is the least significant. For instance, my system has 8 cores. If I wanted to use only cores 1, 3 and 4, I would set the smp_affinity to 1a:\ncpu_7 cpu_6 cpu_5 cpu_4 cpu_3 cpu_2 cpu_1 cpu_0\n  0     0     0     1     1     0     1     0    = 0001 1010 = 1a (in hex)\n\nPersonally, I set up any cpu to be able to pick up interrupt 29 (eth0 in my 8-core system) with: \necho ff | sudo tee /proc/irq/29/smp_affinity\n\n", "Q: Which music players use the SoundMenu? I'm not looking for recommendations on what music player I should use. I would simply like to know which Music players use Ubuntu's new sound menu. The only two I know of for sure are Banshee and Rhythmbox. Maybe Amarok does too? Are there any outside of these?\n\nA: Players need to have MPRIS support and register themselves on the sound menu as described on the sound menu specification to place their controls in it. Currently Rhythmbox, Amarok and Banshee (via the plugin shipped in the banshee-extension-soundmenu package in Maverick) work in Maverick, Xnoise and mpd have plugins / versions you can install externally, and work is underway to add support in Exaile and Quod Libet.\n\nA: By default it's Banshee and Rhythmbox as you said but Banshee needs a plugin to work with it. I'm sure there's others that work but they might need a plugin.

But, when I booted the custom iso image to pendrive & booted using it, the live desktop is showing up. But, how can I install it? There is no installer in the desktop. Can anyone help?\n\nA: The install command should still be the forth item down in the Admin menu.  Remaster doesn't pick up anything from the desktop but the command should still be in the menu.\n\nA: You need to create the short cut in /etc/skel yourself.\n\nA: You need install the ubiquity and ubiquity-frontend-gtk before create your iso file.\n\nA: Ubiquity installs automatically with the Remastersys package, check to make sure it's present.  Also check to be sure you Internet connection is working; it won't create an install icon if it can't connect to the Internet.\n\nA: The steps go like this:1\n1.

I would like to install a 32-bit deb package on AMD64. It is not anything system critical, would it cause problems? Is there a better way to install?\n\nA: You could do it with\n\nsudo dpkg -i --force-all [package.deb]\n\nAfter that you can install needed dependencies with\n\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nNote that this would probably not work because of non-installable dependencies. If the package has no dependencies or all are in Ubuntu - then it will be ok. Alternatively if you decide that you REALLY know what you are doing then you can modify the dependencies of the DEB file manually using:\n\nwget http://sites.google.com/site/lightrush/random-1/goldscripttomodifydebpackagedependencies/videbcontrol.sh\nchmod +x videbcontrol.sh\n./videbcontrol.sh [package.deb]\n\nAnd then force install it with the first command given above.\n\nA: I think you can. There are several packages that do not have a 64bit version. What you can't do is install a 64bit on a 32bit. Nevertheless, depending on the package and dependencies, you might experience some issues. For instance, Firefox 32 bit on a 64bit cannot recognize the 64bit plugins.\n\nA: I've used this a few times: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=474790\nIt's a program called getlibs. As one of the other responders mentioned, you'll install using dpkg's --force-all option. Then you run getlibs to get all the 32-bit dependencies.\nBefore I started using pymazon, i was using this method to get Amazon's MP3 downloader to work under amd64.\nAnyway, the instructions are pretty well laid out in the ubuntu forum post. Let me know if you have questions or issues.\nI think typically there are no issues. I wouldn't recommend it for system critical things .. but in that case there would probably be a 64-bit version available.

Is there a way that I can still purchase and download MP3s from Ubuntu One without installing the Ubuntu One client?\n\nA: You must have an Ubuntu One account (and be subscribed to Ubuntu One Basic) to buy music from the Ubuntu One Music Store. You must also have added your computer to Ubuntu One to buy music.\nIf you do not want to sync your files using Ubuntu One, you can disable file sync in Ubuntu One Preferences. Disabling file sync will prevent purchased songs from downloading to your desktop. You will then need to download your purchased songs from the Ubuntu One website at https://one.ubuntu.com/files\nPurchased songs will be available for streaming from your personal cloud to your iPhone or Android phone if you wanted to sign up for Ubuntu One Mobile.\n\nA: If you buy the music via searching for it using the Amazon search in the firefox search bar, your purchase will support Canonical, and you won't need Ubuntu One.\n\nOnly works in some countries (US, UK, Germany, France, Austria and Switzerland - although I'm not certain the affiliate code works from all of them), and not sure what the download experience is like (nor whether they give you permission to copy the resulting files, nor whether they allow and/or enable you to stream to your mobile device - both of which I don't think I could live without these days).\n", "Q: What is the X server? I have been using Ubuntu for quite some time but, I have no idea what the X server is?\nI hear it quite often.\nI would like to know what the X Server is and what it does. How ~/.xinitrc file is used and knowing what the x.org does in the realm of X Server?\n\nA: As the above poster mentioned, X is a server (meaning a program which other programs call upon and be called by) which is responsible for creating a graphical environment and if it fails for whatever reason, you'll be greeted by Command Line Interface (CLI).\nThe term server can also be said to apply to PulseAudio, which is the sound server, and it calls applications and is called upon to produce sound.\n\nA: X is an application that manages one or more graphics displays and one or more input devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.) connected to the computer.\nIt works as a server and can run on the local computer or on another computer on the network. Services can communicate with the X server to display graphical interfaces and receive input from the user.\nIt's worth noting, a common component used with an X server is the Window Manager, an application that manages the resizing and moving of windows and decorative elements of windows such as title bars, minimize, and close buttons.\nThe X server can be started with the 'startx' command, or more commonly, from a display manager such as gdm.\n~/.xinitrc is a shell script used by xinit, that starts the X server when not using a display manager, to define some application to start automatically in the X server.\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf is a configuration file used to give the X server information about the hardware components used, but now the X server can avoid using it, because it is capable of autoconfiguring itself.\n", "Q: Can the Nautilus Properties page show size in bytes for multiple-selects, and for directories?

You have to edit the source code of nautilus to change this behaviour by just adding an %i to the output:\nStep 1: Download source, install dependencies and open the file to edit\nmkdir -p .p/nautilus && cd .p/nautilus\nsudo apt-get build-dep nautilus\napt-get source nautilus && cd nautilus*\ngedit src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c\n\nStep 2: Change the code\nNow go to line 2338 (in Nautilus 2.30) and change with size %s to with size %s (%i Bytes). Do the same for totalling %s. Change it to totalling %s (%i Bytes)\nIt should now look like this:\n    text = g_strdup_printf (ngettext(\"%'d item, with size %s (%i Bytes)\",\n                     \"%'d items, totalling %s (%i Bytes)\",\n\nStep 3: Compile\nNow you can simply compile Nautilus like every other application\n./configure --prefix=/usr\nmake\nsudo make install\nnautilus -q\n\nNote that Nautilus will be overwritten whenever there will be an update to it through package management. This means you have to build and install it again manually.\nThere is also an alternative way by using an Nautilus script, but this would add another entry in the right click meny instead of having the value in the properties window.\n", "Q: How to fix the panel indicator display errors? \nPossible Duplicate:\npanel items look weird \n\nHow do I fix this error?

I want to change to btrfs. \n1) Is this sane? If a reinstall is really the only sane way to do this, please let me know.\n2) What is the safest way to do this?\nI have enough space on the HDD to create another partition of equal size to the root partition and copy over the data, but will I have to make any changes in /etc or anywhere else?\nThanks.\n\nA: I think you will find a fresh install is the most hassle free way to do this. Bear in mind GRUB cannot currently boot from btrfs so you will need an additional ext3/4 partition for /boot.\n\nA: btrfs is marked as experimental, so it's not recommended. But it's your machine... I'd make sure I have backups of everything I cared about. \nIf it's just system data that you have ( ie from packages)  then a fresh install is the way to go. You can keep your existing configuration by backing up the ones you want in /etc. \nThe other way to do this is, if you have an external drive, you can cp -rfp / to media/your_external_drive. After you unmount the disk, you can reboot into a live cd with the btrfs utils and mkbtrfs /dev/sda ( or whatever dev your disk is on ).\nThis should preserve grub if you have installed it to the MBR. Then you can plug in your external media and copy back the files. Making sure to change /etc/fstab from ext4 to btrfs. \nYou could also do the same thing by splitting your drive in two as you mentioned. However if you wish to format your second partition as btrfs before copying, and use it as the root file system, you will also need to change your GRUB configuration to look at the new partition. \n\nA: You will at least need to edit /etc/fstab to change ext4 to btrfs, change the UUID (thanks Riccardo for reminding me!) and maybe add to or change the mount options (and make sure it gets copied to the initramfs too...).  Plus the changes required to add a /boot partition of course.\nAlso, remember that btrfs is still very new; it's more than likely that it still has lots of bugs.  Make sure you don't put important data on it unless you have backups...\n", "Q: Copying default puredyne audio settings? I would like to use Ubuntu as my main operating system but I get too many xruns when I run jack.

Is there a way to compare audio settings in puredyne with the settings in ubuntu? which configuration files should I look into?\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: As far as I know the only options for JACK are passed from command-line, when the daemon is started. The only config file I know is ~/.jackdrc (i guess it is used by qjackctl) which stores the command that is used to run JACK, with all the arguments. So for example my ~/.jackdrc contains: \n/usr/bin/jackd -P5 -m -dalsa -dplughw:0 -r44100 -p1024 -n3 -o4\n\nIt does store full config.

Is it possible to assign Shift + Tab to the control key on the right?\n\nA: In X11 jargon, the name for a key is called its keysym (short for:\nkey symbol).  The keysym generated by Shift+Tab\nis ISO_Left_Tab.  So, in theory, one could just assign the\nISO_Left_Tab keysym to any key (which you can do with the command\nxmodmap) and this would do the trick.\nUnfortunately, some applications (for instance: Firefox) explicitly\nlook for the Shift keypress, and this breaks it, because you cannot\nassign two keysyms (Shift and Tab) to one single key.\nFortunately, Roger Pate's answer to this AskUbuntu question provides\na way around it: bind a shortcut to a program that will simulate the\nsimultaneous pressing of Shift and Tab.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the xvkbd package\n\n*From the System->Preferences->Keyboard shortcuts menu, create a\nnew shortcut, name it e.g. \"Shift+Tab\" and insert the following\ncommand:\nsh -c \"xvkbd -text '\\S\\[ISO_Left_Tab]'\"\n\nThe purpose of this command is just to send a virtual Shift+Tab\nkeystroke to the currently focused window. (Consult the xvbkd man\npage for more information.)\n\n*Bind this shortcut to any key you want.  Note that, to bind a\nshortcut to a modifier key (i.e., one that is only meaningful in\ncombination with another key, for instance Shift or Alt) you\nneed to deprive it of its modifier status.  For example, before\nbinding right-Control, you need to issue this command in a\nterminal: \nxmodmap -e 'remove control = Control_R'\n\n(See this other AskUbuntu question for another way to bind\nmodifier keys.)\nNote: the xmodmap line above will only have effect until next reboot/logout. To make it persistent, you would have to either put that line into the ~/.gnomerc file, or add remove control = Control_R to the ~/.Xmodmap file. \n", "Q: Can I configure low disk space warning to a lesser threshold?

The regular operating range hovers around 42-44 Centigrade. It gets even worse when the screen is locked with temperatures shooting up to 50C.  The casing next to the track pad gets ridiculously hot and at this point I am really worried that continuous high temperatures is a hard drive failure waiting to happen.\nI've searched and fiddled with hdparm spin-down options with no success. The other related option seems to be installing this thing called laptop-mode-tools. I'm not sure if this will do the trick since it seems to be about extending battery life whereas my problem occurs even with AC power on.  \nWhat are the options I have ? Will installing Laptop Mode Tools do anything good in this case ?\nI am using a SATA 7200 rpm drive. Ubuntu version: Lucid Lynx.\n\nA: 7200rpm is unusually fast for a laptop hard drive, and faster means hotter. There's no standard setting for making a hard disk spin slower, but maybe your disk has a nonstandard setting that the Windows driver uses. You could try hdparm -M 128, which tells the disk to be quieter (which implies slower and therefor less hot). There are plenty of disks where that makes no difference however.\n\nA: Maybe it's just a problem with the hard drive. Is it old? Did it work normally before? Try maybe a LiveCD and see if you still have the heat problem: if you do, then it's probably that your hard drive is in need of a check, maybe even a replacement.\n\nA: I know this might be kind of obvious, but have you tried dusting out your laptop? I had the exact same problem on my Acer Ferrari, and once I cleaned all the dust out it cooled down quite nicely.\n\nA: One change you could make to decrease the amount of access to the disk, is to set the noatime option on fstab. This way the filesystem does not need to be written with the timestamp of the last access to the file.\nI am assuming that for your purposes you do not need this timestamp, as for most desktop users use cases it is not used anywhere, just the modification time to determine when file was changed.\nExample of entry in /etc/fstab with no atime:\nUID=xxxxxxxx     /     ext3   errors=remount-ro,noatime 0 1\nUID=yyyyyyyy     /home ext3   defaults,noatime          0 2\n\n\nA: have you contacted the manufacturer of your computer just to know if they have any reports of possibles issues with those hard drives? \nI used to work on a Customer Support line for a respectable computer company and I've seen those issues even on Windows too.\n\nA: You'll find a disk utility tool under System -> Administration -> Disk Utility. Get it to look at your hard-drive, run SMART checks and see what it comes up with.\nIt could also be the case that your machine does not have enough RAM and is using the hard-drive to compensate. I don't know, I need more details :)\n\nA: I've had this issue on 4 occasions, since having several laptops since 2007. It didn't matter what brand(Toshiba, HP, Dell, ASUS)\nEverything you're talking about is plausible.\nMy situation was resolved in the following way. As much as I have taken on board ALL the comments that OTHER people have also suggested, realistically all the 4 occasions were resolved after finding the one factor in all of them. When I replaced a NEW battery, the overheating issue wasn't a factor anymore. When I returned the OLD battery, YES I had what everybody complained about. In all 3 occasions I did the following; while assuming the battery was OK because I had often kept the AC connection plugged in, of course seeing the FULL BATTERY image made me feel the BATTERY was fine. It was easy to just go on with whatever I was doing. When I came across the issue with the hard drive overheating, I just happened to have a friend that owns a computer store that gave me a NEW or currently working battery(he tested for as reliable), then plugged that into my laptop. For THAT TEMPORARILY REPLACED battery, the hard drive OVERHEATING issue was pretty much non existent. Curiously, I replaced MY OLD battery that I ASSUMED was fine(because I LOVED to see it FULLY CHARGED), then I pulled out the AC adaptor to allow the laptop to run off the battery. NOW THIS is something that I OBSERVED in ALL 3 occasions, that allowed me to now SHARE this observation with you. In ALL 3 occasions, the battery RAN DOWN within the first 20 minutes(none of them went longer than 20minutes(ie 4minutes, 12minutes, 15min, 20min)) and the battery alert came up 7minutes remaining your battery is low. Basically the none of the batteries lasted as they would usually run for at least 2 hours.\nYES I also cleaned out the fan and blew out the motherboard of any dust. My friend has the laptop repair shop. Even keeping the OLD battery, the same issue would arise, the Hard Drive would overheat, while I had the AC connector plugged in, AND if I took out the AC connector, the battery did not last very long(in my case under 20minutes). \nTherefore, the issue was the battery that could not hold it's charge anymore. I had been keeping the battery plugged into the AC for about 3 years ongoing, & yes I also occasionally ran it on it's own without the AC while sitting on the bus or in the airport. BUT I MOSTLY kept it connected on the AC, like ALOT of people, FEELING the ASSUMED comfort that I was always 100% full power when something went wrong(blackout poweroutage in asia Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia). In the past I INITIALLY did what everyone else seem's to always bring up, clean the fan area, blow off the dust, check power settings, blame the hard drive. After REPLACING the battery, obviously because in all 3 occasions it could not CONTINUE past 20 minutes without the warning LOW BATTERY POWER. In my situation, which SOUNDS like what everyone is talking about, the battery was the issue.\nIs the hard drive LESS HOT when only on the BATTERY(not connected to the AC adaptor), YES in my case it was LESS HOT, whether it was on the NEW BATTERY, or even on the FAULTY BATTERY(that did not last longer than 20 minutes with the warning LOW BATTERY POWER). \nBut in ALL occasions, when the FAULTY BATTERY(assumed to be working well with FULL POWER STORED) was connected to the AC connector, the Hard Drive and generally underneath the LAPTOP area was OBVIOUSLY very HOT, then often would cause an automatic shutdown after some time(within 3 hours sometimes or after many hours under 48 hours). It didn't matter whether I had the AIRCON in the hotel room or a fan blowing directly on the laptop. The Faulty battery always appeared to have the issue with the UNDERNEATH feeling GENERALLY UNCOMFORTABLY HOT(hard drive area, cpu, memory chips).\nReplace the battery after seeing it not last very long like I did, then YES for the next 2-3years we MAY NOT have the same issues again(Max 4years). BUT I now know the symptoms of this after 4 occasions. I don't waste time, after watching the battery not last long on it's own. I just get a new battery. \nWill there be times that your AC ADAPTOR is at fault? YES, but in that case, your battery won't be charged fully, and you will see that it doesn't appear to be CHARGING the battery or show connected to the AC power. Replace that too in that case. Only cost $6-$8 in Asia, and lasted LONGER than the batteries. THose occasions I didn't have overheating. I just didn't see the battery being charged.\nHope this HELPS EVERYONE.\n", "Q: How can I install FreeNX server?

Given the fact shred will not be effective on ext3, I wonder what are the available alternatives right now.\n$ man shred\n...\n\n   CAUTION: Note that shred relies on a very  important  assumption:  that\n   the  file system overwrites data in place.  This is the traditional way\n   to do things, but many modern file system designs do not  satisfy  this\n   assumption.   The following are examples of file systems on which shred\n   is not effective, or is not guaranteed to be effective in all file sys‐\n   tem modes:\n\n   * log-structured or journaled file systems, such as those supplied with\n   AIX and Solaris (and JFS, ReiserFS, XFS, Ext3, etc.)\n...\n\n\nA: shred is fine if you want to shred an entire partition, and most will probably be destroyed if you shred a single file, but possibly not all. If you shred the entire partition then you work below the level of the filesystem (and will have to recreate a filesystem after the fact). This will delete everything so should only be done after making a copy of all valuable data, and having reinstall disks to hand. So if you have data on /dev/sda1 you could unmount the partition, or boot from a live disk, and do \n$ sudo shred /dev/sda1\n\nI normally use srm - part of the secure-delete package - for deleting files as it can recursively delete files, unlike shred. I accept it may miss bits, but then I also encrypt my files, so the missed bits should be impossible to decrypt. (I use ecryptfs which encrypts each file with a different key, so provided the first part of the file with the key is properly overwritten, the rest of the file will be impossible to recover. ecryptfs is what is used if you select \"encrypt my files\" on installation).\n\nA: Forget shred (which doesn't work in all cases: no matter what the filesystem is, concurrent activity can throw it off), and encrypt any sensitive file. See these questions:\nHow do I encrypt my home partition?\nHow can I easily encrypt a file?\nIs there a FileVault alternative for Ubuntu \n\nA: As far as I can tell there are no alternatives to shred for journaled file systems. However you can turn your ext3 partition into ext2 temporarily, though it can be a pain. For more information take a look at this article.\n", "Q: How to repair a failed install?

I opened the (recovery?) console as suggested by the error message, there I could see the server is not recognized. I also tried pinging its IP but it was unreachable. Perhaps this is because we're using a proxy?\nSo, what can I do to mount this location permanently?\n\nA: Entries in /etc/fstab normally have four to six fields; I'm not sure if omitting the third field (filesystem type) and fourth field (options) will work. Try\nservername:/home  /mnt/home  nfs  auto\n\nIn fact one problem I can foresee is that since the filesystem type is not present, the boot scripts try to mount the filesystem too early. If you explicitly specify a network filesystem, that filesystem is mounted only when the network is up.\n", "Q: Login sound still plays despite disabling from administration login screen In maverick, I get the login sound when my computer starts up and I auto-login.\nThe happens despite the fact that I've turned off the \"play login sound\" on the administration > login screen dialog.\nHow can I turn off the login sound playing?\n\nA: The login screen dialog dictates what happens when GDM (The login screen loads) The sound you're likely referring to is actually the GNOME Login Sound which can be disabled in the Startup Applications windows under\nSystem > Preferences > Startup Applications\n\n\nA: Maybe try Preferences > Startup Applications > Gnome Login Sound, and disabling it.\nEDIT: I would also like to add that you change the sound to your whim: you could put any 10-second sound when Ubuntu starts up.\n", "Q: How can I add screensavers?

I recently installed Ubuntu Server on an old machine, to set up a website with family photos etc. It is connected to the Internet via my home router (WRT160Nv2).

If you have a livecd/usb, run a disk check on the disk from the terminal and allow it to fix and problems found, and voila, problem solved.\nJust for a heads up, to expand on why this happens: sometimes when you resize the partition, it get's marked as if it is read-only. When this happens, some programs will not function correctly. Once you do a disk check and allow it to fix problems, they drive will remember it's correct state, and you'll be back to smooth sailing. My suggestion for the future is, if you need to resize a disk again in the future, wait until the operation is completed and then always do a disk check immediately after (gparted allows disk checks, but a manual check from the terminal is always best).\n\nA: I just encountered the same problem, with Ubuntu 12.10 installed on 32GB SSD.\nI was noticing that system began to operate slower recently but did not fully aware before system message \"no space on drive..\"\nI tried to google it but most of the solutions were about the mount issues, which did not apply to me..\nTook some time to find the problem, but it seems there was this nonsense xsessions.error file got 23GB (typically places on $HOME folder). when i deleted it, baam!\ndummy solution:\nrun disk usage analyzer and find which folders take the space more.

I have a gigabit network set up in my house and a few Ubuntu based boxes. Out of complete curiosity I would like to check the speed between the two boxes. I am not having any problems with speed or anything, it really is just the geek in me that is curious. Plus maybe the results will let me know if there is room for improvement, or that I have something configured wrongly.\nSo how do you properly test the network speed between Ubuntu boxes?\n\nA: Using this script you can easily test connection speed between your machine and some remote host.\nExample of using:\n$ scp-speed-test.sh user@remote_host 80000\n\n\n\n*\n\n*user@remote_host is your destination host (you must have ssh-access\nto this host)\n\n*80000 is the approximate size of test file (in kbs), which will be\nreceived to the remote host. It is not mandatory argument.\n\n\nA: If you want to test your Ethernet LAN at a lower level you can use Etherate which is a free Linux CLI Ethernet testing tool:\nhttps://github.com/jwbensley/Etherate\nThrowing it in the mix as tools like iPerf (which are very good!) operate over IP and TCP or UDP. Etherate tests directly over Ethernet / OSI layer 2.\n\nA: There are also some other nice command-line tools for bandwidth benchmarking between two hosts:\nnuttcp\nserver$ nuttcp -S\nclient$ nuttcp -v -v -i1 1.1.1.1 ;# 1.1.1.1 is server's address\n\nnepim\n server$ nepim\n client$ nepim -d -c 1.1.1.1 ;# 1.1.1.1 is server's address\n\ngoben\n server$ goben\n client$ goben -hosts 1.1.1.1 ;# 1.1.1.1 is server's address\n\n\nA: I use iperf. It's a client server arrangement in that you run it in server mode at one end and connect to its from another computer on the other side of the network.\nOne both machines run:\nsudo apt-get install iperf\n\nWe'll start an iperf server on one of the machines:\niperf -s\n\nAnd then on the other computer, tell iperf to connect as a client:\niperf -c <address of other computer>\n\nOn the client machine, you'll see something like this:\noli@bert:~$ iperf -c tim\n------------------------------------------------------------\nClient connecting to tim, TCP port 5001\nTCP window size: 16.0 KByte (default)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n[  3] local 192.168.0.4 port 37248 connected with 192.168.0.5 port 5001\n[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth\n[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.04 GBytes    893 Mbits/sec\n\nOf course, if you're running a firewall on the server machine, you'll need to allow connections on port 5001 or change the port with the -p flag.\n\nYou can do pretty much the same thing with plain old nc (netcat) if you're that way inclined. On the server machine:\nnc -vvlnp 12345 >/dev/null\n\nAnd the client can pipe a gigabyte of zeros through dd over the nc tunnel.\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1K | nc -vvn 10.10.0.2 12345\n\nAs demod:\n$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1K | nc -vvn 10.10.0.2 12345\nConnection to 10.10.0.2 12345 port [tcp/*] succeeded!\n1024+0 records in\n1024+0 records out\n1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 9.11995 s, 118 MB/s\n\nThe timing there is given by dd but it should be accurate enough as it can only output as fast the pipe will take it. If you're unhappy with that you could wrap the whole thing up in a time call.\nRemember that the result is in megabytes so multiply it by 8 to get a megabits-per-second speed. The demo above is running at 944mbps.\n\nA: Same as Oli's recommendation for iperf. Just want to add several points:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are also windows clients that enables testing across\nplatforms.\n\n*-t <seconds> changes the test length. -P <n> changes the number of simultaneous connections. For example,  iperf -c [target IP] -P 10 -t 30 tests 10 connections together for 30 seconds and gives aggregated results along with 10 separate connection speeds.\n\n*You don't need sudo. You can simply download the binary at http://iperf.fr/. It should work. Download it with wget, make it executable with chmod, and you can directly run the binary.

I intend to use mutt to send automated emails via cron or at with attachments to my gmail address when particular events happen on my Ubuntu server.  Currently, mutt cannot send email to external email addresses, I believe this is because I need to setup a Mail Transfer Agent.  How do I go about selecting a suitable MTA and how do I set it up to perform what I need it to do?\n\nA: I would recommend msmtp. Setting up other mail systems, such as sendmail, is definitely quite a hassle. Once you have msmtp setup, you can use it with mutt, and you can also masquerade it as sendmail so that programs won't know the difference between the two MTAs. Full details available on the website.\n\nA: The links below provides all the MTA choices you can choose, according to your Ubuntu version:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/mail-transport-agent (for 12.04)\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/mail-transport-agent (for 14.04)\nPersonally, I found that ssmtp is very easy to setup and run, just 2 commands will do:\n$ sudo aptitude install mailutils ssmtp\n$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure ssmtp\n\n\nA: There are a few choices to be made when selecting an MTA to install;\nthe first one is whether you want a send-only MTA or you need a\nfully-fledged mail server.\nThis Unix.SE post\nprovides a comprehensive list of send-only MTAs available; all of them\nare already packaged for Ubuntu 10.10. There are a few things you\nmight want to consider when choosing a send-only MTA:\n\n\n*\n\n*whether it can queue e-mails for later delivery in case of a\nfailure: IIRC, only nullmailer can do this.\n\n*whether it will replace the system mail delivery agent (look for a\nline Provides: mail-transport-agent in the output of apt-cache\nshow package).  If it does, then all mail originating from the\nsystem (including reports from cron jobs, popularity statistics,\netc.) will be handled by the MTA you install: if you do not set up\ncorrect mail aliases for root and other users, the email might\nend up delivered at the wrong address (typically, some sysadmin at\nyour ISP).  Currently, packages nullmailer, esmtp-run (but not\nesmtp) and ssmtp fall into this category.\n\n*All send-only MTAs will just forward your email to another server\n(called \"relay host\" or \"smarthost\"; typically it's your ISP's SMTP\nserver) and then let it handle all the details of real Internet\nmail delivery.  You need to figure out whether there are any\nspecial requirements for connecting to the ISP server (e.g., some\nkind of authentication or TLS) and choose an MTA that supports the\nrequired features (for instance, ssmtp does not support any kind\nof authentication or SSL/TLS).\nFully-fledged mail servers include exim,\npostfix, and\nsendmail.  The\npost-installation installation script for Debian/Ubuntu will do a\ngreat job of producing a working configuration for some common setup\n(delivery of mail to the local system only; sending email through a\n\"smarthost\" -- i.e., a mail server you funnel all your emails\nthrough, typically your ISP's SMTP host; internet site with full\ninbound and outbound connectivity).  IMHO, postfix is the easiest to\nrun and configure, but since it's so capable, its configuration manual\nis way longer than any of the send-only MTAs.\nIn addition, the real risk with setting up a mail server is that, if\nyou make a mistake in the local configuration, you end up with mail\ndelivered to the wrong place (read: lost) or -worse- with an\nopen-relay system that can be used by spammers (and, trust me, they\ncan find an open relay before you realize your server is one).\nMy advice would be then to start with a send-only MTA and then\nupgrade to a full mail server only if you see the need for it (which\nis not the case if you just want to send emails to your GMail\naddress). \n", "Q: How can I create a new user with the equivalent of a Windows guest-user's permissions? Basically, I want the new user to have only a few permissions -- can't read the normal users' home directories, can only read or write files to one directory (can only read or write /home/user/... can not read or write /home/me/ or read or write /home/someoneelse/. That's a common setup for schools and universities which run Windows networks. It seems like it should be simple in Ubuntu.\n\nA: I don't know anything about that other operating system's \"guest user permissions\" but for Ubuntu you can create users with any privileges you like. On the other hand, there exists a \"guest session\" which can be accessed from an already started session. Both are described here.\nOther than the permissions you give to the new users which you create, I advice you to set your home directories access permissions from your side (in a positive way, in some sense; by setting your rules for your your directory itself; don't rely on the guest users' \"less-privileged\" situation.) To do that, go to /home, right click the home directory you like to set, go to properties, go to permissions and set them as you like. This can be done via command line as well.\n\nA: In ubuntu, most files can be read by anyone and files can only be written/changed by the owner.\nSo the write permissions are ok by default. If you want to change the read permissions: do the following:\nSay you have a file \\home\\user\\file.txt, which has normal permissions. If you execute\n cd /home/user\n ls -l file.txt\n\nyou'll see something like\n -rw-r--r-- 1 user group  45655 2010-01-16 17:21 file.txt\n\nThis means:\n\n\n*\n\n*rw = read and write permissions for the user \"user\",\n\n*r = read permissions for the group \"group\"\n\n*r = read permissions for anybody else.\n\n\nThe default group is the group which only has \"user\" as a member. So you only need to change the r permission for anybody else, do it as following:\n cd /home/user\n chmod o-r file.txt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod = change modifiers, change the permissions\n\n*o = all the others (not the user and not in the group)\n\n*-r = delete the read permission\n\n\nIf you now execute\nls -l file.txt\n\nyou should see\n-rw-r----- 1 user group  45655 2010-01-16 17:21 file.txt\n\nSo the last 'r' is deleted. You may use wildcards in your command like \nchmod o-r f*\n\nwill change all files that start with 'f'. If you want to use it on a complete directory, including all subdirectories, you need to add the '-R' (recursive) parameter:\nchmod o-r -R /home/user\n\nwill delete the read rights from the complete /home/user directory for every user who's not the owner or in the group.\nI don't recommend changing system directories, but if you do, you'll need to add \"sudo\" before your command. There is no important information in system directories, so having them unwritable is enough.\nfinal answer:\nsudo chmod o-r -R /home/*\n\n\nA: You can use umask such that file permissions are set to only allow the file owners access to their files automatically.\nYou could also use extended attributes.\nAnd I guess it should be possible to protect a guest session with technologies like SELinux or AppArmor too.\n", "Q: How can I disable the prompt to run programs for my digital audio player's memory card? When I plug in my digital audio player two prompts to run programs appear simultaneously:\n\nHow can I disable the prompt for the player's memory card so that only one prompt is displayed?\n\nA: Right now, there is nothing you can do. Nautilus doesn't have the functionality to recognize that there are two storage devices in one player.\nAs a workaround you can go to the nautilus settings and edit them so that no prompt at all is displayed. You still have the option to open the default media player by right-clicking on the device-icon.\n", "Q: Problems with Blender3D and ATI graphics I recently upgraded to 10.04, then to an ATI graphics card (I used the internal graphics port before) and now noticed that blender is behaving very strange. Menus don't work or very slowly, fragments on the screen and so on. I didn't try anything else because it's impossible to use.\nThe card is an ATI Radeon HD 4650.\nDid anyone experience similar problems ? \n\nA: I have an ATI Radeon HD 4350 with the open source drivers, and Blender seems to work fine on Ubuntu 10.10 (with visual effects enabled).\nYou could try a 10.10 live CD to see if the problem still exists there for you.\nAnother thing you can test, on your 10.04 install, is to disable the \"visual effects\" in the Appearance configuration dialog.  Sometimes these effects interfere with applications that also use OpenGL.\n\nA: I have an ATI Radeon 4850 and I use a logitech trackball mouse. My OS is Ubuntu 10.04. I tried starting blender using this command from a terminal:\nLIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 blender\n\nThat made things somewhat better, but did not really fix the problem. Disabling visual effects in the appearance settings fixed everything (after i restarted blender without the LIBGL... setting).\nI would have just voted up the above answer, but I don't have enough points yet, and this was a very frustrating problem for me so I wanted to say something. Thank you JanC, your answer helped me out.\n\nA: Two things I would suggest:\nUse the fglrx driver if you are using the open-source driver,\nTry using Blender 2.5, as this is much better than older versions, and should be so as well with the cases where 2.4x was troublesome (it was known to be on ATI cards).\n\nA: Could You show the display of Yoyr xorg.conf.new file?\n(HowToCreate Xorg file)\nOne more thing - did You chck if 3D rendering works?\nglxinfo | grep -i direct\n\n(might bee required to install mesa utils)\n\nA: I think that's it's somthing that i problem with the Blender that you have install and it need to be restart that the problem can be solve but if that doesn't work you can always test to see if the OS is slow itself if not i think it's the program.\n", "Q: There is no Network Manager in the panel for the second user I have Ubuntu 10.10 and I have two users registered on it.

I was using an app called \"MouseImp\" on Windows many years ago. The tool was quite handy, since you were able to scroll much faster than with the mouse-wheel e.g. on large pages. Moreover you were able to scroll horizontally as well.\nThis all was possible by just keeping the right mouse-button pressed anywhere on a window and dragging the pointer up, down etc.\nThe software became open-source a few years ago but AFAIK there has not been a linux port.\nBest,\nYSN\n\nA: I have just found the tool that pefectly works!

I have a laptop with an ATI Radeon HD 3650 video card and I always had to jump through hoops to get things working. \nIf you are using Maverick however, then things should just work right out of the box for you (i.e. you would by default use the open source driver). If you want to download the proprietary driver then you can go to System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers and download the ATI/AMD proprietrary FGLRX graphics driver. \nI did not notice any performance change before/after installing proprietary driver in Maverick so I don't think it's needed. If you using Lucid and below however, I noticed that without the fglrx driver my laptop tended to overheat and automatically shut down, so if you encountered such scenarios and you cannot upgrade to Maverick, try to use AMD's driver.\n\nA: The radeonhd guide gives great instructions on removing the fglrx drivers, but it is not the right method for lucid/maverick unless you want to install the infrequently updated radeonhd drivers which are different than the radeon drivers.\nI would take a look at this page to get a rundown on what the radeon drivers can do : http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature.  It references the drivers as \"xf86-video-ati\", but they are labled under the \"xserver-xorg-video-ati\" in the ubuntu repository.  You need to make sure that you completely remove the the flgrx files as they can screw up the xf86 install.  You will find a lot of good info on the drivers at the x.org website and tips on clean installation.\nOne thing to note - I am running Kubuntu and ran into problems when I used the non-repository PPAs on the xorg driver.  I would try out the ones Ubuntu provides before using the xorg PPAs.\n", "Q: Converting a video file in arbitrary file format into MPEG4/H.264?

I am trying to show my site in utf8 and some parts are getting messed up because of this!\nThanks!\n\nA: If your file does only contain characters that are part of (7-bit) ASCII there is no way to tell the difference between UTF-8 & ASCII, so I'm not surprised file would say that file is ASCII then.\nIf you want to serve those files as UTF-8, you better make it explicit in your HTML, PHP code, or server configuration.\n\nA: Your file can be displayed fine...UTF8 only does the tricks above the ascii characters.\nSo the first 128 chars are the same. And if you do not use any special non-ascii chars it can be identified as us-ascii (= ascii).\nTechnically an ASCII text file and an UTF-8 with the same contents are equivalent then.\nIf there are still issues on the server it might be one of its settings...\n", "Q: Any good sites explaining how to use PiTiVi?

That is a promise no one is intending to break. More than that, The Ubuntu itself, will remain licensed under same licenses it is today, right? \nI would appreciate if one can tell how this shall affect our use of the great Ubuntu whatsoever.\n\nA: I think there are two things here.\nFirst : Ubuntu is and will remain free. At least, that's what they claim.\nThis should answer some of your concerns.\nThen there is Canonical. This company is a for-profit company, supposed to make money by contributing/supporting Ubuntu. Since Ubuntu is free, they obviously need to find other means of making money. And this is where the problem lies : in order to make money, they plan to add new services/features that will not be part of Ubuntu, but sold alongside it.\nUbuntu One is an example.\nWhat is debated here is their way to achive that : by forcing evey contributor to give up their freedom in licencing model, and let canonical \"own\" everything contributed. This giving up of freedom is an ethical problem. It goes against the \"mind\" of the free software licences. And could break the free spirit of Ubuntu itself.\nI think the main issue is a question that we can't answer now: how much of Ubuntu will stay \"free\" as it is claimed, and how much will be optional services sold by canonical ?\nIf more and more \"super-features\" are being added as paying options, you could argue that Ubuntu is less free than it should... Especially if those features are proprietary software (lacking even the \"free-as-in-speach\" side of the \"free\" meaning).\nRight now, I think Canonical is still doing its job, and I still appreciate it. Ubuntu is a really solid and user-oriented distribution, and I won't change because of this article. But that's a personal statement, and since I'm not a defenser of the free software, it cannot be seen as \"the\" answer to the question.\nMoreover, I really don't have a crystal ball to look at the future :-) In some years from now, maybe I will change my mind and start using something else because Canonical has been pushing too far their commitment for profitability... I really hope that's not going to be the case.\n\nA: Most of the Ubuntu community are strong believers that Canonical will stick to keeping Ubuntu free (as in freedom, and also in price) - as they promised - and under the same licenses it is today.\nThere are people however who have real issues with Canonical's copyright assignment policy, and I suggest you read the article you linked to find out more about their concerns.\n\nA: Michael Meeks has written a very good article on his blog about the pros and cons and different forms of copyright assignment.\n", "Q: Graphical tool for creating Deb packages Are there any graphical tools for creating ubuntu/debian packages?\n\nA: Yes, there's Ubucompiler:, but development has ceased:\n\nDescription:\nAn easy software to ubuntu, debian, linux mint to compile, make, install and create a .deb package\nOn the other hand, on this wepupd8.org page, a critic of Ubucompiler reads as follows:\n\nUbucompilator  does not add the necessary Build-Depends to the Debian\n  control file so yes, the .deb package can be created with\n  Ubucompilator, but you cannot use the source code to say Launchpad so\n  it can be build for different architectures, etc. Also, the packages\n  are not signed and so on, so that's not the proper way of creating a\n  .deb file\n\n\nA: You could try debomatic.

I've got pretty much the same problem as this old 2006 thread on the Ubuntu forums: my old laptop's lid is a bit shaky, which causes the computer to wakeup/suspend if I just touch it the wrong way (e.g. lifting it up to move it).\nBack then, the fix (see link) was to have a startup script disable LID in /proc/acpi/wakeup every time the computer boots. I'm wondering if there's a better, less hacky, solution?\n\nA: Its no less hacky, but you can simplify the solution by adding echo \"LID \" > /proc/acpi/wakeup to the /etc/rc.local file.

Is there a way to fix this?\n\nA: There is no fix AFAIK. But you can usually drag the window keeping ALT pressed, clicking on any place of the window and dragging the mouse. That way you can reach the part of the screen that are hidden. Not exactly a great solution, but useful for occasional use.\n\nA: There is a known issue with the Aspire Ones. You need to fix up the resolution settings to give you native resolution equal to your screen's, since the resolution of the screen is not one of the standard ones.\nThis is for the A0751h (mine) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne/AO751h note that the resolution is different from yours, would help if you gave your model number.\nBy making it the right monitor resolution, your problem might be resolved.

I don't know why and where from I have it, and also not how I can configure it. If I print using that printer, I cannot find the output file anywhere.\n\nA: As Marcel said, the CUPS-PDF \"Print to PDF\" functionality is no longer needed as \"Print to File\" gives you the same functionality.  However, if you do have it installed, it will only work if you have a directory named \"PDF\" in your home directory.  I had to actually create that directory in my home folder to get the \"prints\".\nYou can create it by opening a terminal and typing:\nmkdir PDF\n\nIt is case sensitive.\n\nA: Generally speaking, there is not need to use the PDF printer anymore, because you should have the generic \"Print to file\" option in every printer dialog. This option allows you to choose PDF or Postscript and also an output directory. If you have an additional PDF printer, this is because you have the cups-pdf package installed.

But replacing CC-02 with the ip address works fine. I have checked /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname and I have them configured properly. I don't exactly know what the log really means. Do I need to open another port?\n\nA: Your rules look fine for ssh, but I think you have some name resolution problems, as proven by it working if you use the IP address. You say that your hosts file, etc is set up correctly. is that on the target machine or the source? The source machine needs to be able to get the target machines name ... a good way of doing this is by enabling DHCP on your router. If you want to verify that this is the problem, manually put an entry in your hosts file on the source machine.\nthe strange part is that the log does say the port is blocked ... from what I can see (and from the output of my own UFW status) it should be fine. \n\nA: You must configure your rules for default forward policy.

I need to be able to log the times that an Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop system is suspended and resumed.\nI can detect when the system is resumed via a DBus signal (org.freedesktop.UPower.Resuming()) but the corresponding \"org.freedesktop.UPower.Sleeping()\" signal is never fired. Ideally, I'd like to use DBus, but given the lack of success I'm having, I'd be happy with any solution providing it can be called from the command line.\nI've discovered one way to do it:\ntail -f /var/log/pm-suspend.log | grep \"performing suspend\"\nThis simply listens on one of the pm logs for the suspend logging. Although this works, it's probably rather brittle. I've found relying on log parsing to be rather problematic in the past due to changes in the log statements. \nIdeally I'd like a more robust mechanism. The service that invokes this will be ran as root.\n\nA: Try putting the following in /etc/pm/sleep.d. This should be independent of whether your machine uses APM or ACPI.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nLOGFILE=\"/var/log/sleep.log\"\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n        resume)\n                echo \"Resumed from suspend at `date`\" >> \"$LOGFILE\"\n                ;;\n        thaw)\n                echo \"Resumed from hibernation at `date`\" >> \"$LOGFILE\"\n                ;;\n        suspend)\n                echo \"Suspended to ram at `date`\" >> \"$LOGFILE\"\n                ;;\n        hibernate)\n                echo \"Hibernated to disk at `date`\" >> \"$LOGFILE\"\n                ;;\nesac\n\n\nA: A few other options that may work on more modern systems are:\ncat /var/log/syslog | grep 'systemd-sleep' which will display system suspensions and resumes with timestamps.\nor\njournalctl | grep suspend which will display also display suspensions and resumes with timestamps.  The suspends here will look something like PM: suspend entry (s2idle) and the resumes will look like suspend exit.\n\nA: You can drop a script in /etc/apm/suspend.d. It should be executed every time the machine suspends.\nYou can also use /etc/apm/resume.d in a similar fashion to run a script when it wakes up.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu on Microsoft Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V?

I'm trying to get a sound card that will plug into a really new Mini-ITX board. That leaves me with PCIe or USB, and PCIe cards seem to be expensive, crappy, and they required expensive riser and extension cards for Mini-ITX boards. I have an old Sound Blaster Live 5.1 that sounds great, but new Mini-ITX boards don't have any PCI slots.\nHere are some options I've found, and why they won't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turtle Beach Audio Advantage Micro II: It's only stereo, not 5.1\n\n*Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 SB1090: People on Newegg says it doesn't work in Linux\n\n*Aureon 5.1 USB MKII: Discontinued, and only available in Europe\n\n*Various PCIe cards at Newegg: The first two Creative ones have crap reviews, and the rest are really expensive.\n\n\nA: X-Fis (even the USB ones) work. They didn't used to but ALSA added drivers for them over a year ago and most people now don't seem to have an issue with them. I know the first review of one on Newegg complains about Linux support but seriously, there used to be threads complaining about them every day, that's fizzled off into nothing.\nYou'll find with most of the better consumer audio devices that a lot of the special hardware (read: CMSS-3D, EAX, etc) requires special Windows-only software. You'll be able to hear sound and you'll be able to hear it in 5.1 setups with DTS (if that applies) but you won't get some of the fancier effects.\nAlternatively, you can use something as simple as a HDMI connection (if your Mini-ATX board has one, or through a graphics card) and port that into an AV receiver. Lots more money but much better sound and equaliser options (IMO).\n\nA: that is dificult to find but a give you some places to start to find :\ncommunity wiki :\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsSoundCardsCreativeLabs\nalsa page \nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main\n\nA: ASUS Xonar series includes USB hi-fi 7.1 soundcards!\nThe U1 and U3 are acclaimed USB solutions, the rest of them (from the screenshot) are new to me. Since you'd use optical output (SPDIF) to feed the sound signal e.g. Card > Amplituner > speakers there should be no problems common with 3xanalog output (3xmini-jack) found in Creative Notebook series.\n\n\nA: This Virtual 5.1 USB Sound Card and Virtual 7.1 USB Sound Card are not bad and pretty inexpensive compared to some other sound cards.  I was using a more expensive external sound blaster card before and I'm not able to tell the difference.\n\nA: You may want to look into recording interfaces with multiple output channels. I for example use a Behringer FCA610 to connect a 5.1 speaker system. It has 8 output channels, so 7.1 is also possible. Recent versions of PulseAudio should offer 5.1 and 7.1 profiles for this device.\n", "Q: Clone Ubuntu Machine I have an install of Ubuntu Maverick on slicehost, that I'd like to replicate on a different machine (a kvm VM install).\nIs there a simple way of mirroring all it?

Format it and mount on /mnt.\n\n*Run rsync:\nrsync -a -z -A -X -e ssh --inplace --progress root@remotehost:/ /mnt/\n\nYou might want to add a -n to the rsync invcation to test it before doing the transfer.\nIf you don't have any POSIX ACLs or extended attributes in the remote VM, you can leave out the -A or -X options respectively.  If you have any hard-links on the remote VM, you must add a -H option.\n\nA: Systemback is a better then Windows Restore like program that can make live USB copy in a very simple way, no terminal needed. Also restoring from Live USB or on fresh install is also posible. It takes about 2-3min to make full backup of the system and can be scheduled at will.

(Not that I'm lazy, but I don't have time to learn the necessary commands...)\n\nA: Emacs\n\n\n*\n\n*emacs \n\n*emacs-snapshot-gtk  for the version which supports good readable freetype fonts, gtk and other visual goodies. \nEmacs allows you to compile and debug inside the GUI. With CEDET package, it has got nice code completion for C and C++ projects. Color theme will give nice themes and syntax coloring for the source code. Emacs can be customized heavily using the e-lisp. \nEmacs running with CEDET and color theme showing code completion.\nAlso refer to Ubuntu Community Help Wiki for EmacsHowto.\n\n\nA: KDevelop \nI very highly recommend KDevelop. It's a KDE program (cough KDE > gnome =P), but it will work under gnome. It's like a color explosion. Pretty much every single variable, class, method, language construct, etc has a different color. Not just local variables one color, global another etc. Every local variable will have a different color from each other.\nIt also integrates with cmake extremely well and is generally a great IDE to work with. I really wish there was a java and/or python plugin for it.\n\n\nA: qtcreator \nQT Creator is the best C/C++ IDE available for Ubuntu.\n\nQt Creator is a cross-platform C++ integrated development environment which is part of the Qt SDK[2]. It includes a visual debugger and an integrated GUI layout and forms designer. The editor's features includes syntax highlighting and autocompletion, but not tabs. Qt Creator uses the C++ compiler from the GNU Compiler Collection on Linux and FreeBSD. On Windows it can use MinGW or MSVC with the default install and can also use cdb when compiled from source.\n\n\n\nA: Sublime Text 2\nI recommend Sublime Text 2.

What's the best way to automatically apply security updates? Or any updates for that matter?\n\nA: This answer to the desktop upgrade question will apply to servers.\n\nA: Note that some updates (on a server, it tends to be most updates, from personal experience) require restarting one or more services, or even rebooting the entire server, to take effect.  Restarting services, much less rebooting, isn't really a task I feel comfortable automating.\nI use cron-apt on my server to automate downloading, but not installing, updates.  It does it once a day rather than running as a daemon.  It emails me when there are updates waiting to install.\nWhen I receive such an email, I log in when it is convenient and install the updates, then restart whatever services need restarting.\nIt's not usually obvious which services need to be restarted.  For example, an update to libssl usually requires restarting just about every web, mail, SSH etc service there is.  Or an update to libpng might require restarting Apache because PHP links to it.\nSo I use checkrestart to check which services should be restarted after each update.  This is provided by the debian-goodies package.\nI also know that if the kernel is updated, I always need to reboot.\n", "Q: How can I restrict program access to other users?

The problem becomes more evident if you have little memory and use swap a lot or if your windows partition is very fragmented. It should be still far faster than under a typical VM or LiveCD.\n\n*The filesystem is less reliable than in a real installation. This is because you have 2 filesystems nested within each other which makes it more vulnerable than ntfs or ext3 taken individually. This can be an issue if you hard reboot (unplugging the power). Hard reboots are never ever a good idea, but even less so in wubi. We have taken some measures to minimize the risk (and will add a couple of tricks to next build), so that hard reboots can be better tolerated, but the rule of thumb is: do not hard reboot. In linux there are alt+sysrq key combinations if you get stack for any reason. \n\n*Hibernation / Suspend does not work properly. We are looking into this with the help of some ubuntu kernel devs. Either we'll fix that or we will disable hibernation/suspend.\nA side issue is that with wubi people tend to allocate less disk space than they would with a normal installation (since they take it as a trial and then keep using it). Of course if the free space is over, it is going to create issues, but that is hardly our fault. We are looking into ways to expand virtual disks, but that would be a separate app anyway. That said in linux you can create a link from a folder within a real partition to a folder within a virtual disk, thus alleviating the pain.\nIn short: allocate enough space, do not hard reboot and do not suspend/hibernate. Other than that it should be the full monty: same speed (other than for #1), same hardware support/detection, same behaviour, same software. A small trade-off considering that we* provide what can possibly be considered the easiest OS installer ever created, whatever the OS.\nAs for long term use, I would consider wubi as a mid-term solution. You can use it happily for weeks and months, but because of the 3 issues above, if you find yourself using Ubuntu quite heavily, you might want to do a full installation later on. That said we have a tool to migrate virtual disks to a real partition (LVPM by tuxcantfly). So migration should be quite smooth (that should result in an installation which is 100% identical to a standard one while keeping your data and settings). \nIf you have a free partition or a spare hard disk and are confident about partitioning and ISO burning there is no much reason to use Wubi, just go straight for the full installation via live CD. But for people that do not know what a partition is, wubi is probably the best solution to date, particularly once tools such as LVPM reach final status. I hope that wubi will bring a small revolution to Linux installers and hence to Linux adoption, similar to what Knoppix/LiveCD did a few years ago', and I would not be too surprised to see Wubi clones implemented by other *nix distros in the near future. \nFYI: Wubi will hopefully become an official installation method by next Ubuntu release and we will \"merge\" with Ubuntu. Even though the recommended long term installation will still be based on the current LiveCD installer (with partitioning), Wubi installer will also be available on the official CD and as a separate download. By Gutsy we will use the LiveCD ISO as opposed to the Alternate ISO as a source of packages and the installer will be fully \"graphical\".\n\n\n*\n\n*A big chunk of the merit goes to the people that gave us the possibility to boot linux from within windows (grub4dos) and provided us with r/w access to ntfs (ntfs-3g), without such technologies wubi would not be possible today.\n\n\nA: You've inspired an article on Phoronix, entitled The Performance Impact Of Ubuntu's Wubi Windows Installer, which on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th pages has a series of benchmarks that show quite clearly the performance impact, see an example below:\n\n\nA: Well, two things. One, EXT4 is faster than NTFS, here is a proof :\nhttp://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=ODIxNw\nTwo, with NTFS there is fragmentation and even if it's difficult to determine how much it will slower the system you know that it will eventually slow it down.\nThree (because there is always a three), don't install Ubuntu on Windows, you don't want to use non free software to start your system that will eventually get an update from Microsoft one day and you won't be able to start Ubuntu again.\n\nA: I have benchmarked the differences.  It also depends on the system but the primary reason for the performance hit is ext3 and the fact that the disk image is a file.\nThese are four things you can do, however, to increase performance on a Wubi install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert the filesystem of the disk image from ext3 to ext4.  Don't forget to change your /etc/mtab file line to the following, first:\n\n\n/dev/loop0 / ext4 rw 0 0\nIf you don't, you won't boot.  You can even change that line without doing anything else (and performance will gradually get better with any new files added) but I used the following method, which works even better and gives the benefits of ext4 immediately for all files (you can make your root.disk file larger at the same time, like I did):\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeandDuplicateWubiDisk\n\n\n*Defragment your root.disk and swap.disk files from within Windows using sysinternals' contig command. Just download it for free from the Microsoft TechNet website.  Or, you can use any other program that can defragment a single, large file.  This made a big impact on improving performance for me, too.\n\n*Use the threadirqs kernel line parameter.  Your mileage may vary but this worked well for me on my dual core Dell system I use most.\n\n*If a program seems still to cause the system to slow down and take a performance hit when you run it, you can add parameters to the offending program in the desktop file like so (this example uses software updater but it will work with others):\nionice -c 3 nice -n 19 /usr/bin/update-manager\nMaker sure you have the ionice command installed or this step will do nothing except throw an error.\nAfter doing these four things, the performance hits are a lot less than before.  I haven't had much of any issue since and have been very happy with my Wubi install thus far.  Hope this is helpful.\n", "Q: Redirect http page to another inside my computer?

I'd like to do this with software I can run locally (on a server or desktop; doesn't matter).\nThere must be something out there that handles some of the basic functionality of Pipes such as merging feeds, filtering, querying for keywords, etc. but I'm having a hard time finding it. There are various parsers that might do the job, but they're overly flexible and require much configuration upfront. Ideally I'd have something in the lines of a simple command that I can run in a cron job, or a daemon, which will fetch some feeds, perform the operations I want, and output or serve the resulting RSS feed.

Then, put them all on the device and see if one works, use the same settings from then on. If the software you use comes with device presets, you can just try out all of them. (Pretty tedious I know, it should be your last resort)\nThese devices all require some relatively specific format of encoding, which is normally done by some * piece of software that is shipped with the device.

You can just deactivate the driver and then activate it again to accomplish what you want to do. After that, restart.\nWhat happens \"under the hood\":\njockey makes sure the driver is not blacklisted in /etc/modprobe.d/ and that other conflicting drivers are blacklisted.\nIf this doesn't work, do it by hand: First figure out the name of your current driver by running lsmod | grep mac80211.\nmac80211              205402  1 ath5k\ncfg80211              126496  3 ath5k,mac80211,ath\n\nIn this case the driver is ath5k. Prevent this driver from loading by adding the line blacklist ath5k to any file in /etc/modprobe.d/.\nNow make sure your new driver (say ath_pci) is loaded on boot, by adding its name on a new line in the file /etc/modules.\n\nA: Discussed Already.

Here are some resources:\n1: A Byte of Python (an easy introduction to the Python programming language, free)\n\n\n2: Dive into Python (an advanced book, free)\n\n\n3: Python for Software Design  (an advanced book, free)\n\n\nAlso, bookmark the PyGTK 2.0 Reference Manual. \n\nA: The single best resource for learning Python (and programming in general) is Alan Gauld's massive, and extremely well-written, tutorial called \"Learning to Program\". \nPython.org lists this tutorial as its third recommended resource on the Official Beginners Resources page. You'll find a ton of other resources there, but I really do think Alan's is the best. \nYou'd also be doing yourself a great favor by signing up for the Official Python Tutor newsgroup. \n\nA: I'll speak more about programming specific stuff. For Ubuntu-esque tips, see other answers. To get you started, first pick a programming book and learn, sharpen your programming skills. Then, along the way, keep thinking about what you believe is missing on Ubuntu. Once you're done, you either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Join an open source project that is already working towards that goal. If needed, relearn new programming language (knowing more than one programming language is definitely a plus, it has zillions of benefits).\n\n*Start your own project solving the said problem. Give up when you find out it's too much work and then go back to A. This solution will have the advantage of making you learn what are the challenges in making a good program from scratch.\nAs a good Python learning resource, I recommend \"Learn Python the hard way\" by Zed Shaw. It is free, and by the hard way, the author actually means: by getting your hands dirty, by digging straight into programming. It is structured into 52 exercises, and in each you will learn about a different topic of Python and actually implement it yourself. (This is, kind of, the point of the book; if you're not gonna do it, don't bother.) \n\nA: If you have the money, than I'd recommend picking up the Linux Programming Interface, by Michael Kerrisk. It's not a book you would read through cover to cover, which would take you months at the very least, rather it is a reference manual that gives you a deep insight into the inner workings of Linux from a programmers point of view. That is, however, depending on what level of development you're looking to go to. If you're just going to write plugins for existing applications, then this is probably overkill, but if you're planning on doing some serious development on Linux, then you should think about picking this up. There is a lot of information on the internet on this subject, but there's no one stop shop for it all and you'll spend a good amount of time looking for it, time which having a book like this can save you.\n\nA: There are a plethora of resources to help you get started, including the tutorials on Quickly, at http://developer.ubuntu.com\n\nA: If you want to develop applications then you need to learn some programming language (C, C++, Java, Python, C#)\nYou can also help in other ways e.g. Translations, Documentation, Testing etc.\nThe following links will provide you some links regarding Ubuntu and Gnome development.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment\nhttp://library.gnome.org/devel/\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/\n\nA: If you're not in a hurry you can check out my tutorials. \nI've just started using Quickly and learning python as I go. I'm a .net developer as my day job, but I love Open Source, so I started making some tutorials. \nYou can check out my new blog where I'm recording the creation of my Quickly project. \n", "Q: Is there a way to completely remove the keyboard layout from the indicator? I need to completely remove the indicator, no flags, no abbr. nothing!\nI was able to do it in 10.04 using a gconf key that has no scheme and I heard that a proper scheme will be available in 10.10 but I can't find anything.\n\nA: Press Alt+F2 and enter gconf-editor\nNow navigate to apps-->gnome_settings_daemon-->plugins-->keyboard and uncheck active\nRestart.\n\nA: By the way, if you're removing it because of the big ugly (redundant) image in the 10.10 keyboard indicator, I've got a solution to that. I created a set of SVG flag images. If you install them and activate \"show flags\" in your g-conf editor then the text and ugly image both disappear. In their place you just have the one (much smaller) input language flag. I've posted the SVG's and full instructions here: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Language+Flags+for+Faenza+and+Elementary?content=133726\n\nA: This is a known bug \nthe key I was talking about is: \ngconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/general/disable_indicator -t bool true\nFor pre-maverick only.\nThank you all for the input.\n\nA: I have completely same task, and i have just solve it for myself by using icons with the sizes of 1px * 1px, this is not completely removal, but it's best solution i could found.\nSteps:\n1) download icons (for example from here)\n2)Untar (expand) the downloaded file into the folder ~/.icons/flags. If there is no \"flags\" sub-folder just create it. Then you need to enable the display of flags for input languages in gconf:\n3) Open gconf-editor (in Ubuntu type ALT-F2 to open the \"run application\" dialogue and then type \"gconf-editor\" without the quotes and press enter).\n4) Navigate the folder tree to Desktop > Gnome > Peripherals > Keyboard > Indicator\n5) Activate the check-box for \"showFlags\"\n6) Find icons for your languages in folder ~/.icons/flags, for me it was us.svg and ru.svg. Open it in image editor like Inkscape, and resize to 1*1 px (in inkscape Shift+Ctrl+D), save it.\n", "Q: Tailing two log files I have a web application that outputs to a number of log files with performance information. One log file outputs code execution times and another outputs SQL timings. I have no control over the logger or the code that produces the log files, but I want to output the logs in one place.\nCurrently I am doing something like this\ntail -f sqlLogs.log | grep sql-time\ntail -f perflogs.log | grep exec-time\n\nThis outputs something to the console every time an SQL is executed in the application. But I have to run the code in two separate SSH sessions. However, what I want to be able to tail both files, in the same SSH session. Is this possible? \n\nA: Have a look at MultiTail.  It's your friend.\nYou can have the multiple log tails in\n\n - different windows, a al vim's 'split'\n - or have it merge the two (or N) streams into one view and\n - you can filter steams by regex and, if you like,\n - it will 'tee' the output to a file\n\nhttp://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/\nOn Ubuntu 10.04: sudo apt-get install multitail\n\nA: Yes, tail outputs lines appended to all the files given on the command line:\ntail -F sqlLogs.log perflogs.log | egrep '(sql-time|exec-time)'\n\n\nA: Yep, using the screen command, you can have 2 bash sessions running on one terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run screen to get started, \n\n*Then type Ctrl-a then S (NOTE: capital S) to split the screen into 2. \n\n*Ctrl-a then Tab will move you between the two sessions. \n\n*Ctrl-a then c will start a shell in that new region.\n\n\n(Please see Riccardo's answer before using this, his is much simpler, I'll leave this up as it may be useful for people with similar but different problems).\n\nA: You can use mkfifo to multiplex the output to one pipe\ncreate a fifo pipe, tail n files to the pipe, then cat the pipe\n mkfifo pipeName\n tail file1 &\n tail file2 &\n ...\n tail fileN &\n cat pipeName\n\nwhen finished \n rm pipeName\n\n", "Q: What does \"libraries not eligible\" mean as part of the application review process? I read the application review process and I' ve got a question. In the \"What Apps Are Eligible\" section there is something which I don't understand:\n\n\n*\n\n*No other software can depend on the application being submitted (e.g. development libraries are not eligible).\n\n\nSomebody can explain it with an example please..\n\nA: It's saying that applications reviewed by the Application Review Board have to be standalone in that they can be used (and therefore tested) straight away without needing to use them as part of another application.\nThe Application Review Board is there to test software for developers but only software that they can test. They don't want to spend hours building it into something else just to be able to test it.\nSo a media player would be allowed but a media codec (that has to be built into a player to be tested) would not.\n", "Q: Can not upgrade Server Edition Can someone tell me how can I upgrade my ubuntu server 10.04 to ubuntu server 10.10?\nI try:\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nOutput:\nChecking for a new ubuntu release\nNo new release found\n\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nOutput:\nReading package lists...

However, it does not boot from my laptop. Laptop hangs with a blinking cursor. Can you please help?\nThanks.\n\nA: Did you use USB creator and copied live Ubuntu CD? \nOr you installed Ubuntu on the external hard disk and then trying to boot from that disk?\nIf your answer is first one, then first try to boot your laptop from live CD. If it boots, either bios settings may be problem or you may try again creating USB from live Ubuntu. If it does not boot even with live CD then there may be some hardware issue with your laptop (like unsupported drivers).\nIf your answer is second one, then hardware configuration of your laptop and desktop must be different. And installed Ubuntu may have drivers for your desktop and it might be conflicting with laptop hardware. This mostly happens with display drivers. Live installation auto detects the drivers and sets them. While installed Ubuntu tries to use installed drivers.\n\nA: 1) check BIOS settings to enable booting from USB-drives\n2) make sure a bootloader (e.g. GRUB) is installed on the external boot-drive\n", "Q: Is it possible to do a RegEx Find in Cream (VIM's derivative) via the dialogs?

I also imagine both services are currently more expensive than say putting software in the iOS market. On the other hand I'm sure Canonical offer reasonable prices - I just think they're trying to attract businesses rather than individuals at the moment.\nCertainly it is possible for applications to be added 'mid-release'.\n\nA: All apps for the Software Center can be submitted to http://software-center.ubuntu.com/dev now - and it will accept apps that require activation/license keys now for Ubuntu 11.10, too!\n", "Q: How does my computer suspend? Trying to understand how suspend works in 10.10.\nhttp://git.webconverger.org/?p=home.git;a=blob;f=.bashrc;h=8ba57b877e31a03c5f0b1675b42f747d81dd31ad;hb=HEAD#l31\nI use an alias suspend='sudo /etc/acpi/sleep.sh && sudo alsactl init 0\nThe alsactl bit is to re-init my sound card which sometimes does not come out of suspend correctly.\nAnd then:\n/etc/acpi/sleep.sh -> /usr/sbin/pm-suspend -> /usr/lib/pm-utils/bin/pm-action -> /usr/lib/pm-utils/pm-functions\nIrony is /usr/lib/pm-utils/bin/pm-action claims to be \"Simple suspend script\".\nStill don't know how it works. I think I directly used s2ram before.\n\nA: The gnome-power-manager tool listens for suspend button events, and spawns pm-suspend. Extensive detail about how pm-suspend operates can be found in the man pm-suspend command output. The quick version:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/pm/config.d is scanned for files that define environment variables.\n\n*Each of the scripts in /etc/pm/sleep.d and /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d are called in order with the \"suspend\" argument.\n\n*The system is put to sleep via the defined interface module. By default, this is the kernel suspend interface: echo -n \"mem\" >/sys/power/state. See /usr/lib/pm-utils/pm-functions where do_suspend is defined.\n\n*The system wakes up.\n\n*Each of the scripts in /etc/pm/sleep.d and /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d are called in reverse order with the \"resume\" argument.\n\n\nIf you need to add a script to the stack, I would suggest adding it to /etc/pm/sleep.d and name it something that does not conflict with other scripts, and make sure it processes the \"suspend\"/\"resume\" argument.\nFor debugging, see /var/log/pm-suspend.log as well as the man page which has more information on how to do testing.\n", "Q: Problems with graphics of Sony Vaio Z I have problem with my Sony Vaio Z VPCZ1.

If you have a Nvidia graphics card, this may be the issue with it.\nNow goto System->Administration->Hardware drivers, and select and activate the nvidia current driver if you have an nvidia card. The driver will be downloaded and activated automatically, and you will be prompted for a reboot.\n\nA: The sony-vaio-z-series Linux community is doing a great job at keeping up with the hardware nuisances. There are basically two z-series lines, the 2009 one and the 2010 one. Most of the linux-specific modules and tweaked kernels are now up-to-date to both. The Sony Vaio Z-series is the priciest of the kind but Linux people seem to be loving it. Asus U/UL series and Acer Timeline models are also doing well:\nhttp://linux-macbook-air-killers.blogspot.com/\n\nA: Yep, it worked for me too! Sony Vaio series Z 2010, I installed Kubuntu 10.10 with the nomodeset option to be able to see the installing graphical interface, then copied the Adams 2.6.37_amd64 linux image and headers, installed it with dpkg and it worked! Touchpad is working, screen brightness is working. However, I cannot figure out which graphic card is running. How can I know it?\n\nA: I'm happy owner of VPCZ11. Some time ago I've patched my bios and set video card switching policy to manual. That way I got my nvidia card working with proprietary drivers and 'nomodeset' setting in grub. But brightness control wasn't working. \nI got installed patched 2.6.37 kernel and almost succeed. What I've got is: both video cards working (intel and nvidia). Nvidia card is working with Nuoveau drivers (a bit slower than with original drivers). Brightness control works with both cards. But suspend doesn't work. Actually laptop suspends properly, but on keypress it performs fresh boot. Now I'm back to unpatched kernel on Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick. Suspend works fine, but Intel card is not usable and brightness control doesn't work too.\nWhat I want is: have suspend working with intel card and patched kernel. I don't want performance, I'm writing code that should perform elsewhere and not on my laptop :) And I'm not a gamer person.\nThank you all for any suggestion/help :) Ubuntu forever! :) Banzai!\nUPDATE\nI've managed all my problems. Now I've got intel graphics card with 3D acceleration (read compiz) and suspend working.

Here's a picture of the problem:\n\nThe problem affects xterm but not gnome-terminal. I also get similar weird artefacts in emacs (though only after I alt-tab away and back to the window for the first time).\nCtrl-L or moving the window or Alt-Tabing away and then back again makes the lines disappear.\nSomeone asked about the problem on ubuntu forums with no luck so far.\n\nA: This is clearly a bug. You should report the bug against xterm in Launchpad. \nYou can also mark as affecting emac (using the \"Also Affects Distribution\" link once you have reported the bug). The maintainers of those two applications can then comment and potentially reassign the bug to other packages.\nUpdate: the issue has been reported, take a look at Launchpad Bug #663469.\n", "Q: Compiz-like effects in Gnome shell? In Gnome-shell we do not have compiz any more? In KDE4 we have the native desktop effects, I would like to know if the Gnome-shell we will need yet of compiz.\n\nA: Gnome is quoted as saying \"'Because the GNOME Shell project wanted \"tighter integration\" between the panel and window manager than cooperating with the Compiz project would allow, this could actually be true. This mailing list post has more information.'\" that statement was made in response to \"I can't use Compiz with GNOME Shell!\"\nMost likely Compiz will be phased out of Gnome Desktops.\nIt might be best to see how well Compiz works with KDE, LXDE, IceWM, and XFCE.\n\nA: Compiz compositing capability will be replaced by Clutter, which will be integrated into the next generation of Metacity window manager, called Mutter. This means you won't need Compiz.  Since Mutter is closely integrated, you cannot replace Mutter with Compiz.\n\nGNOME shell uses compositing and is\n  integrated with Mutter, a compositing\n  window manager for X11. Mutter is the\n  next generation of the Metacity window\n  manager which uses the Clutter toolkit\n  for compositing.\nGNOME Shell has received some\n  controversy in the free software\n  community because the planned tight\n  integration with Mutter will mean that\n  users of GNOME Shell will not be able\n  to switch to an alternative window\n  manager without breaking their\n  desktop. In particular, users will no\n  longer be able to use Compiz while\n  GNOME Shell is running.[2]. Discussion\n  between the developers of Compiz and\n  GNOME has failed to resolve the issue.\n  However, it will still be possible for\n  users to run the GNOME desktop\n  environment without GNOME Shell and\n  still use whatever window manager they\n  choose.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell\n\nA: Compiz works well with Xfce and KDE however the latest KWin effects have better integration into KDE 4.6 Plasmoids.  Compiz-Fusion was meant to be a transitionary package for DEs to use in developing their own native effects.\n\nA: No\ncompiz is not supported in gnome-shell , gnome-shell uses mutter instead of compiz\n", "Q: Losing network connection after hibernate When I hibernated my computer and I fire him back up, my network connection is lost in about 50% of the cases. The network applet finds other networks, but it can't find the network I was connected to before the hibernate.\nI have this most of the time with a wired connection but it also happens with a wireless connection.\nI've tried re-plugging the cable (or switching off and on the wireless card), disabling the network via the network applet and re-enable it. The only thing that works is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*log out\n\n*log in back again\n\n*disable all networks\n\n*enable them again\n\n\nA: Try restarting your network manager;\nOpen a terminal window and run the following command:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nIn general keep this command somewhere. It's pretty useful.\n\nA: This is a bug that occurs on many systems (sorry I do not have the link to hand). I'm not sure there is a fix for it as yet, as previously it was solved (for me at least) but broken after some updates. Works for me on suspend right now though.\nIf it is with wireless only, there is probably not much you can do, but if it is with a wired network, your best is to report a bug against network-manager on launchpad.\nYou could also try switching to connman (I don't use this so cannot verify) as it might work better than networkmanager in your situation.\n\nA: I had the same problem on Ubuntu 10.04 and used this solution:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=6465454&postcount=6\nSince installing Ubuntu 10.10 (fresh install) I haven't experienced this problem.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: How can I log my SSD's read performance over time? I'd like to keep a log over time, perhaps weekly, of my solid state drive's read rate as determined by a tool like System -> Administration -> Disk Utility -> Benchmark:\n\nIs there a way to archive the test data from Disk Utility, or can you think of any other tools that would allow me to accumulate this kind of data semi-automatically?\nI would like to be able to perform the benchmark using read-only methods so as not to unnecessarily wear the drive.\n\nA: Take a look at bonnie++. \nYou'll need to awk and grep the hell out of it to get the numbers you want to log over time, but it should be possible to echo what you want in a comma-separated-value format to a new line of a log file.\nCron that up and in six months time, import that into a spreadsheet and plot a nice graph. Or use R.\nEdit: Bonnie++ actually writes a CSV as its last line of output, so that would be somewhat easier to pull into long time logs (if you can work out what the column titles are).\nBut Bonnie++ relies on being able to write a file (or multiple) to the filesystem and then it runs read tests against those files. People make a lot of fuss about SSD wear so this might not be optimum.\n\nA: hdparm can also do tests. These are somewhat simple compared to bonnie++ but they'll run fast (bonnie++ can be a resource hog when it runs) and don't need to write to the disk. That also means it's not testing the efficiency of the filesystem that will (hopefully) improve over time with kernel upgrades.\nYou can run a test like this:\nsudo hdparm -t /dev/sda\n\nAnd it'll respond with something like this:\n/dev/sdf:\n Timing buffered disk reads:  432 MB in  3.01 seconds = 143.53 MB/sec\n\nNow, this doesn't cover latency. If that bothers you, there is a script called seeker that you can download and compile which does some seeks and measures the time. You'd need to learn a bit of C but you could customise the output to something you could log easier.\nOr you could trust that the response time on a SSD just isn't going to get much worse than ~0.3ms\n\nA: If you do want to capture the detailed data from Disk Utility (aka the \"palimpsest\" program), you can make a copy of the cached data in the ~/.cache/gnome-disk-utility/drive-benchmark directory.  It seems that you'll find the latest results for each disk there, in a format that is odd but not too hard to parse (data rows separated by colons....).  You could just copy those files to an archive, giving them a unique name each time.  Unfortunately they are overwritten in the cache each time, and the summary data is not recorded, so you'd need to recalculate that.\nSee 'Bug #794929 in gnome-disk-utility (Ubuntu): “Disk Utility benchmark, x-axis undefined”'\nfor a request and response on providing more clarity on what the data actually mean.\n", "Q: empathy with webcam When empathy will have camera support? and I have problem to change files with it too.\nafter 11.04 the next topic of canonical have to be to improve the empathy. the program is waek yet.\n\nA: I'm using without problem the webcam in Empathy under Gtalk protocol (Gmail chat), and the videocall works well. It doesn't work with Yahoo or MSN yet...\nBye!\n\nA: It should have webcam support. I never tried it, but there is a webcam-symbol next to some people with the option to do video/audio calls.

I am writing a MIDI sequencer in C++ using asoundlib. Sometimes I would like my application to stop all voices, calling an All-Notes-Off event. I do it by calling a note-off to every note at every channel, since this is the only way I know, but for some reasons I am not really happy to send 16*128=2048 events in one moment. Is there any other approach to that? It would be perfect if I could send an event to the control queue, is there any? If not, then what is the way it should be done?  \nAny help is welcome, since the Internet lacks a good, detailed ALSA documentation.\n\nA: According to the crash course on the midi specification you simply send an event 'Z' with an all notes off which is explained as 00 B0 7B 00\n00 to indicate no time delay\nB0 to send a midi control signal\n7B to send an all notes off\n00 does nothing (padding)\n\nYou can see a list of midi control bytes here: MIDI Controller Numbers\nHappy hunting!\n", "Q: How can the Ubuntu font be used with LyX or LaTeX? I use LyX for creating documents and would like to be able to format the output of my documents so that they use the Ubuntu font. \nIn the LyX document settings, it appears that there are only a fixed number of fonts available.\n\nIs it possible to add the Ubuntu font to this list?\nIf not, is there a way to use the Ubuntu font in LaTeX?  I can export the LyX document to LaTeX, make my changes and then use pdflatex & co. to create a formatted document.\n\nA: I've made a bundle of the Ubuntu Font Family for LaTeX2e. You can download it from github:\nhttps://github.com/tzwenn/ubuntu-latex-fonts\nFor installation just run:\nsudo make install\n\nand then type \\usepackage{ubuntu} in your LaTeX file.\n\nA: On 12.04 I enabled in the Lyx UI as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*install packages: texlive-xetex and etoolbox\n\n*in Lyx: Tools > Reconfigure\n\n*close Lyx and restart\n\n*Document > Settings > Fonts > Use non-Tex fonts \n\n\nA: To use the Ubuntu font (or any other system font), use XeTeX\nsudo apt-get install texlive-xetex\n\nOnce you have created your document in LyX, add some TeX code at the start of the document (using the TeX button): \\fontspec{Ubuntu}. This makes the whole document use the Ubuntu font. If you want to switch to another font at some point use the \\fontspec command again with the font name of the other font.\n\nTo allow this to render to a DVI/PDF/etc., some settings need to be changed in Document>Settings.\nClick on 'LaTeX Preamble' and enter this into the text box:\n\\usepackage{fontspec}\n\\usepackage{xunicode}\n\\usepackage{xltxtra}\n\n\nAlso, under 'Language', set the encoding to Unicode (XeTeX) (utf8).\n\nNow export the document as LaTeX(pdflatex):\n\nThis will appear to do nothing but will actually output to DOCUMENT_NAME.tex.\nNow open a teminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal) and enter:\ncd ~/Documents\nxelatex ubuntu.tex\nxdg-open ubuntu.pdf\n\nReplace ~/Documents with the path of the folder containing your document and ubuntu with the name of the document. This should create a PDF file of the output of your document and open it in the default PDF reader:\n\nDoesn't it look pretty? :D\nThanks to Marcel Stimberg for suggesting XeTeX and providing the useful links to resources. I suggest people to have a look at those for more details.\n\nA: Converting a font in the true type format (like the Ubuntu font) to the format LaTeX understands is possible with tools such as ttf2afm, ttf2pk etc. but involves a lot of work. There are many howtos on the net (e.g. this one).\nAn alternative is using XeTeX instead of LaTeX/pdfLaTeX, which is capable of using any system font. It's also not too difficult to get LyX working with XeTeX, the LyX wiki has a howto: http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/XeTeX\nUpdate: Vincent-Xavier Jumel posted a very concise summary of how you can convert the Ubuntu fonts to a LaTeX package in a blog post. You can then simply use \\usepackage{Ubuntu} in LaTeX or LyX.\n\nA: Since LaTeX/TeX uses fonts that are created with Metafont, I would think the Ubuntu font must be put into a format that Metafont can use and create its internal font information from. In turn you need to then use the Metafont created font files to create the dvi files from your LaTeX source files.\n\nA: Beginning with the 2.0.x series LyX has built-in support for XeTeX/LuaTeX. To use the Ubuntu font you simply need to Doc > Settings > Fonts > Use non-TeX fonts, then select Ubuntu font from the combo. (The accepted answer gives a more complicate solution than necessary.)\n", "Q: VPN issues on web browsing I'm using Maverick and this is the setup:\nOur router connects us to the company's VPN through which we can access some internal websites. I have to connect also to a customer's VPN in order to use remote desktop and their websites daily.\nThis customer has a web interface to connect to its VPN, it launches a Java App which signs us in and lets us use the services on their network.\nWhen I do this, I loose access to my company's VPN services (websites) in all browsers. This doesn't happen in the rest of the (Windows) boxes, and I'm the only one using GNU/Linux on the office. \nRight now, I log out of the customer's VPN to access the company's services, but I'm sure there's some solution so that I can use both VPNs together.\n\nA: It would help to know what VPN your customer is using. \nIt sounds as though there's split-tunneling going on with the Windows clients in your office--only the traffic specific to the customer site is traveling through the customer VPN, leaving the rest of the traffic to go where your company router sends it. It would seem that this isn't happening on your Maverick system. \nYou might find an answer if you figured out what VPN the customer was using, and looked for information around split-tunneling, Linux, and that particular VPN product.\n\nA: What are the ip ranges the vpns are allocating for routing? It might well be that both are the same (i.e. 192.168.*) and because of that you can only access one at a time.\n", "Q: Restore default packages Yesterday I installed KDE through gnome in Ubuntu 10.10 and after some time I decided to uninstall kde manually through the Synaptic Package Manager. I completely removed all the packages which I thought were related to KDE and not critical for Gnome, but I was wrong as it turns out not only did I delete KDE I also deleted a lot of critical packages for Gnome.\nI think I deleted at least half of the critical packages and now I do not have even a terminal and a browser. Also when I rebooted I could not even log in to Ubuntu so this my  question: is there a way to repair Ubuntu? \n\nA: Without a terminal of some form, it could just be one you get by switching to a tty (e.g. pressing Ctrl+Alt+F6) and a network connection you will struggle. \nIf you have access to these two things you should type\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nto reinstall all the packages installed by default.\n\nA: If you can log into the text mode, you can still install gnome via apt-get.\nIf you could not connect to the internet, you can download a ubuntu alternate cd. Just add the cd into your /etc/apt/sources.list. Then you can use apt-get.\nAlso you can use a livecd and \"chroot\" to your existing ubuntu system.\nThe methods listed above may be too difficult for you. So you'd better back up all your private data and application settings, and re-install ubuntu.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't recognize my hard drive I am trying to install Ubuntu 10.10 and remove my existing Windows Installation.

I found that the version are a little different (10.04 has 5.1.41 and 10.10 has 5.1.49). I would like to be able to install the lucid version on my maverick machine, but Google isn't turning up anything useful to accomplish this task.\nAnyone know how I would go about doing that?\nThanks.\n\nA: You can do this using the \"Synaptic Package Manager\". You find the program under \"System > Administration\". Find the mysql-server package you have installed and select \"Package > Force version...\" as shown in the screenshot below.\nThis will show you a list of the available versions.

Also make sure that that particular user has rights to access the samba share.\nIf possible, it is always a good idea to go for NFS sharing. As long as you do not need to connect from a Windows box you will be happy with NFS. If you want to continue with NF have a look at the quick start section of this official Ubuntu documentation.\n\nA: Try to change the permission to the directory. if your directory sharing path is /home/user1/Images then run chmod 777 /home/user1/Images.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Use Network-Manager to connect to a WiFi Access Point on the command-line I'd like to connect to a wireless access point from the command-line.\nIdeally, I'd only need the name of the AP.

Maybe you'll also have to add the key to the user's keyring first (to avoid password popups).\nBut of course that won't work on a desktop that uses another NM-client than nm-applet (e.g. KDE).

Back Story\nI tried out the latest Netbook Remix on my Dell Inspiron 600m and it was badly broken. So, I've been trying to downgrade to a usable system. I've managed to restore a 10.04 Netbook Remix and restore my home dir but I still have the issue of linux not coming back from suspend. \nLinux 2.6.28-11-generic\nNow, I've downloaded the 9.04 installer and narrowed down the issue to the linux version being used. The stock linux 2.6.28-11-generic works perfectly. Suspend is fully operational and it even goes to sleep when you close the lid and wakes up when you open it. I can keep this version of linux by pinning the meta package and upgrading with apt-get. Unfortunately, the graphic tools don't work as well (for me ymmv) and the Update Manager looks like it will upgrade linux despite being asked not to.\nPin linux-generic at current version\nTo tell apt-get to leave the linux kernel untouched when it upgrades the system, we will pin the package linux-generic to the current version. On a fresh 9.04 Netbook install, the linux-generic package is at version 2.6.28.11.15\nspinlock@sendack:~$ apt-cache policy linux-generic\nlinux-generic:\n  Installed: 2.6.28.11.15\n  Candidate: 2.6.28.19.24\n  Version table:\n     2.6.28.19.24 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com jaunty-updates/restricted Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com jaunty-security/restricted Packages\n *** 2.6.28.11.15 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com jaunty/restricted Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nTo pin this version we need to edit /etc/apt/policies (as root) and add the following lines:\nPackage: linux-generic\nPin: version 2.6.28.11*\nPriority: 1001\n\nUpgrade with apt-get\nNow, you can upgrade the system with apt-get:\n$sudo apt-get update\n$sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nYou may have some non-linux packages that are held back when you upgrade but you can use the install flag to upgrade those individually:\n$sudo apt-get install firefox\n\nQuestion\nSo, here's my question, after all of that, I'm still running the 9.04 version of ubuntu.

You could potentially install the old kernel from jaunty manually in a newer Ubuntu, or just keep upgrading and keep all the old kernel versions installed. The newer versions are designed and supported on a newer kernel though, and may not be compatible. You can boot to another kernel using the grub bootloader. If you do not see the grub menu, try holding shift while booting. Though you might be able to easily fix the issues you have with the new kernel.

This will allow the developers to help improve Ubuntu. (The same procedure is used for any application.) This automatically adds your hardware information to the report.\nNote: you need to remove the PPA version, and have the version from the standard repositories installed to do this.\n\nA: This happens if you delete your hidden ~/.gnome* folder(s) and Gnome does not have what to show.\nSolution: start in Ubuntu live cd and copy the hidden ~/.gnome* folder(s) from the cd to your hard drive user folder.\nAlternatively copy from the root folder to the user folder.\nThen boot from hard-disk and create launchers to recover lost shortcuts.\n\nA: I believe this is probably a hardware issue with your graphics card. Sometimes the shell freezes when mutter doesn't like your graphics driver. Report a bug on the GNOME bugzilla so the developers can possibly find a workaround.\nOn another note, the technology for GNOME Shell is still a bit immature right now, and mileage will vary. Reporting a bug about your issue should help them to improve it.\n\nA: I fixed it by re-installing ubuntu... makes me wonder if I got rid of something it depended on by accident..\n\nA: Try this, press alt+f2 and type:\n\ngksudo gedit\n\nWhen gedit opens, open the file \"/etc/environment\".

I have a dark GTK theme installed in my Ubuntu 10.10 install and a persona installed for Firefox that I also like.\nThe problem is that Firefox is using my dark GTK theme for items like buttons and text fields on common web pages, and this commonly creates unreadable menus, text areas, and buttons.

This is great because your system theme will still apply for menus etc. but the webpages will be rendered as they are with light themes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to about:config in your Firefox browser\n\n*Right click and select new->string\n\n*Enter widget.content.gtk-theme-override as the name\n\n*Enter a light GTK theme that you have installed on your system for the value. e.g. Arc\n\n*Restart firefox.\n\n\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/6rbvvw/photon_rectangular_tabs_have_landed_in_nightly/dl4318f/\nSee also https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1283086\n\nA: Start Firefox with one of the following command:\n\n\n*\n\n*GTK3 Firefox 46+: env GTK_THEME=Adwaita:light firefox\n\n*GTK2 Firefox <46: env GTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/themes/Simple/gtk-2.0/gtkrc firefox\nThis will launch Firefox using the Simple/Adwaita:light theme, which is pretty basic and should blend with your Persona. You can try other themes, by replacing Simple with the theme name, but this doesn't work with all themes.\nSo far I have successfully tested with Simple and Redmond themes...\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\n\nA: The best solution to tell Firefox that it should use the light theme instead of the dark is by specifying the GTK_THEME variable prior to launching.\nSo, 4 ways you get for doing this..\n1- from terminal you can do:\nGTK_THEME=Adwaita:light firefox\n\n2- if you hate the terminal and wanna close it once firefox works:\nGTK_THEME=Adwaita:light firefox &\n\n3- from firefox about:config you can set the following setting to false:\nbrowser.display.use_system_colors\n\nWON'T WORK FOR localhost SITES! so if you are a web developer/designer it won't work out that well for you.\n4- if you want this to be the defualt behavior:\nJust add two lines to the Firefox launcher script located at /usr/lib/firefox/firefox.sh\nin the terminal type down:\nsudo gedit /usr/lib/firefox/firefox.sh\n\nlook at the beginning of the script for this:\nMOZ_LIBDIR=/usr/lib/firefox\nMOZ_APP_LAUNCHER=`which $0`\nMOZ_APP_NAME=firefox\n\nexport MOZ_APP_LAUNCHER\n\nand change it to this:\nMOZ_LIBDIR=/usr/lib/firefox\nMOZ_APP_LAUNCHER=`which $0`\nMOZ_APP_NAME=firefox\nGTK_THEME=Adwaita:light\n\nexport MOZ_APP_LAUNCHER\nexport GTK_THEME\n\nFinally, restart Firefox.\nHope this helps.\nPlease help me by voting this up.\nThank you :)\n\nA: This add-on (suggested by koushik) works well for me.\nI'm using Firefox 57 on Ubuntu MATE 17.10\n\nA: There is a very simple way to get the default color scheme back for web pages while still keeping your GTK theme for Firefox elements. I know it's not exactly what was asked, but it may help people coming here from a Google search.\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to about:config in your address bar. \n\n*Scroll down until you\nsee the settings \n\n\n*\n\n*browser.display.foreground_color\n\n*browser.diaplay.background_color\n\n\n*If those settings have been\nmodified, right-click them and select reset.\n\n\nThat should be it, no restart necessary. This works with Firefox Quantum.\nSettings in about:config\n\nA: I'm using the Adwaita dark theme with Ubuntu 18. I'm using the default theme in firefox 63.0.\nThe best solution in my case, with no side effects at all, was to force firefox to use a light theme (Adwaita in my case) for web content rendering only :\n\n\n*\n\n*Open about:config in the address bar. \n\n*Create a new string entry : widget.content.gtk-theme-override ( right click > New > String ).\n\n*Set the value to the light theme to use for content rendering (Adwaita in my case ).\n\n*Restart firefox.\n\n\nChange the GTK theme for content process only\n\nA: UPDATE: My original answer actually gets overwritten when Firefox updates.\n\nMy current (permanent) solution\nEdit\n~/.mozilla/firefox/abcdef.default/chrome/userContent.css\n(where abcdef is a random string)\nAdd  \ninput:not(.urlbar-input):not(.textbox-input):not(.form-control):not([type='checkbox']):not([type='radio']), textarea, select {\n    -moz-appearance: none !important;\n    background-color: #eee;\n    color: #111;\n}\n\n\nOriginal answer\nI found a solution to make Firefox completely ignore your GTK theme.  \nEdit /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop and change  \nExec=firefox %u\n\nto  \nExec=bash -c 'GTK_THEME=\" \" firefox %u'\n\nWhen you (re)start FF it will only use the FF theme.\n\nA: You could start Firefox with a different user and the same profile. \nCopy your current profile (~/.mozilla/firefox/profile) to that different user's folder, chown it to the user, and then on your console run:\nsu newuser\nfirefox -profilemanager\n\nThis sounds a bit overkill, but you can put it into a script. Firefox will use the theme on the profile, but keep the unthemed GTK from the new user.\nAlso, this is the kind of stuff that makes it fun to use Firefox and Ubuntu :P\n\nA: You can add another theme to Firefox that you like from Tools -> Addons -> Themes. Then just use that theme instead of the default one.\n\nA: Bannaz solution works great since I don't use .desktop files, but sometimes (or maybe every time) when I upgrade Firefox, my patch to the launcher script disappear.\nSo my solution to this is to create a new launcher script file which sets the preferred GTK theme, executes the original launcher script and does not get affected by an upgrade.\n\nThe original launcher on my system is located at /usr/bin/firefox.\nI created a new launcher located at /usr/bin/local/firefox containing the following:\n#!/bin/sh\nexport GTK_THEME=Adwaita\nexec /usr/bin/firefox \"$@\"\n\nChange the path locations to suit your system. And don't forget to make it executable:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/firefox\n\n\nA: Personally, I like to use a dark theme for Firefox but I do not want a dark theme for websites. Recently, Google and other websites like archwiki started using prefers-color-scheme in their css to automatically switch to your browser's dark or light theme.\nOn Firefox version 95, all I had to do was go to about:config and change the value of layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override to 1.\nAfter making the change, restart your browser and be sure to clear your cookies.\nIt should be noted that this applies to Google search and other pages when the user is not signed in. You may also have to adjust your individual user settings for websites like Twitter, Facebook, and Google that also use an independent dark setting for each user as these settings are independent of your GTK and/or browser theme.\n\nA: I came to this question wondering the same thing, after getting tired of bugs with Firefox's GTK implementation, however since none of the answers right now truly get rid of GTK integration, I decided to try removing as much of Firefox's GTK integration as possible myself.\nThe end result is https://github.com/dominichayesferen/Firefox-CSSTheme-GTKless. It isn't a full removal of GTK theme usage, due to userChrome limitations, but it covers most of what can be changed with userChrome.\nYou could very likely fully remove GTK theme usage with source code modding, but I unfortunately would not know how to.\n", "Q: Out of range error with dual displays I'm trying to setup dual monitors on a new 10.10 installation.  I have an LG w2040 and a Westinghouse l2610nw.  The LG works, but the Westinghouse displays an \"Out of Range\" notice and nothing else.  If I try to change the resolution in the NVIDIA X Server settings window and hit Apply the Westinghouse monitor stays unchanged, but the LG picture gets skewed and I have to reboot.  I can change the Westinghouse resolution and hit Save to X Config File and logout and log back in and the setting shows as changed without skewing the LG, but the Westinghouse is still dark.  They both work fine in Windows.\nMy video card is an Nvidia 8500GT.\nThings are currently set to \"separate X Screen\", though I haven't had much luck playing with twin view either.\n\nA: Just so this doesn't hang here unanswered, The problem wasn't with dual monitors, but with the Westinghouse monitor itself.  The system recognized it fine but could never get a picture to it.  I had it plugged in with the HDMI to DVI cable that it shipped with.  I swapped that out with a normal VGA cable and it seems to work fine.  Not a solution, but definitely not a problem with dual monitors.\n", "Q: change my remote controls keys I have problems changing my remotes keys. The rc has a joystick for controlling the mouse cursor.

the mouse as a remote control input which means xinput can't then use it as a normal mouse. Without lirc claiming the hardware xinput would pick up the mouse and you'd see it when running xinput list from the command line under Virtual core pointer\nSo since your configuration binds it up what you need to do is use the LIRCMD (Mouse daemon) which will create a fake mouse that xinput can see and will run the events to that fake mouse. See this website for further details: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man8/lircmd.8.html\nAs you can see here running lircmd with the -uinput option should create a standard linux mouse event port which you should be able to configure in your lirc configuration.

Hope you got a watch for Christmas ;-) Here are the actual possibilities I see :\n\n\n*\n\n*Screenlet option : with compiz and the widget layer you can make widgets nicely fade with the F9 key. Of course it doesn't fade on mouseover and as for the outdated look it's subjective but I think you won't be happy with that solution.\nPersonally, I do not autohide my top panel because I want to have time, cpu and ram usage displayed and in that case I would have to press a key.\n\n*Hacking NotifyOSD : as you pointed out, the NotifyOSD does almost all you want.\nI made a small Python script implementing this idea : https://gist.github.com/760615.\nDownload it and launch python NotifyOSD_clock.py in a terminal.\n\nThat clock nicely fades away on mouseover of course.\n\nHowever I recommend not using this script as is :\n\n\n*\n\n*it will flood your $HOME/.cache/notify-osd.log file\n\n*it will block other low priority system notifications\n\n*and you can't move the clock  \n\n\nIf you like that user interface, you would have to reuse the notify-osd source code to make a standalone application (not so easy for the usual Ubuntu end-user, he !).\n\n*DIY (almost) from scratch : SO recommands libXosd if you want to write your own script.\n\n*Propose your idea for a future Ubuntu release : http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/\n\n*Saving vertical space without getting rid of the top panel : just by moving the window buttons in the top panel (cf. point 4) because it allows you to keep the usual clock applet visible.\n\n\nPersonally I wouldn't be happy with that kind of big transparent clock being always over my windows. I'm neither satisfied with the autohide option which hide everything and the top panel already uses too much vertical space. Maybe should we have a mix of autohide and autofadeaway in that panel.\nAnyway, having all those vertically-stacked panels, toolbars and tabs isn't the most clever way to fully use our ever-wider screens (nope, I don't spend all my time watching 16:9 movies).

You could click the little pushpin icon next to a title to make it show up all the time, no matter how many notes had been added after it.\nSince upgrading to Maverick, the icon no longer displays the note titles, so I have no way of knowing which note I'm clicking on. Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: This is due to a bug with the notification area fallback of the new Tomboy indicator. You'll see the fallback if you've removed the indicator applet that hosts application indicators from your panel. To see note titles until it's fixed, you can either add \"Indicator Applet\" back to your panel, or use Tomboy as an applet.\n\nA: This is a bug that's only been fixed recently. It will be published through an update, you can subscribe to that bug to follow its progress.\n\nA: If you can't wait for the stable version to get the fix, and dislike indicator applet, the fix is already in the PPA.

Today I did my typical \"update all\" routine when the package manager GUI told me many  things needed updating. It chugged along and needed some confirms. I rebooted because one of the upgrades had stripped all the chrome off my windows making them look old-school X. After the reboot I have a red triangle in my system tray telling me my package info is outdated. Odd, since I just ran a big update. \nNow if I go to the command prompt and run apt-get update I get the following:\njal@jal:~$ sudo apt-get update\n[sudo] password for jal: \n0% [Working]/usr/lib/apt/methods/http: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/apt/methods/http: undefined symbol: _Z14maybe_add_authR3URISs\nE: Method http has died unexpectedly!\nE: Sub-process http returned an error code (127)\n\nThrowing a little Google Foo around I came up with this bug report from Dec 2009 on the Debian list. It seems the proposed fix in that bug report is to downgrade to apt-0.7.23.1, apt-get update, and upgrade apt again.\nI usually just run into things like this without asking for help, but when the package manager is involved I get just a little cautious. I don't really want to blow my packages up or do something ugly to my system. \nSo in short, how do I downgrade apt without screwing myself in the process?\n\nA: Try this first :\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall apt\n\nI tried it myself, no risk to your system.\nIf it doesn't work, you'll have to get the package from http://packages.ubuntu.com/. \nChoose the good one for your distribution.

To use a recent SRU as an example:\n./whatchanged python_papyon\n\nThis is what it does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if there's an update candidate; exit if there's none\n\n*If a candidate exists, create temporary directories and fetch the source packages for both the installed version and the candidate into them\n\n*Compare the two with debdiff and output to stdout (you'll probably want to redirect for easier reading)\n\n*Clean up the temporary directories.\n\n\nIt probably needs to better handle certain things that may go wrong during source retrieval, the flow control is probably a bit off, and there must be more elegant ways for version checking, but it worked fine in my limited testing so far. For now, consider it a quick hack that works, and improvements are most welcome. I'll push it to a bzr repository and/or create a Launchpad project if it's useful to a few people.\nEdit: Rather than let it rot on pastebin, I've started a Launchpad project for it; you can get the latest trunk revision with bzr branch lp:whatchanged.

System > Administration > Disk Utility\nWhat's the difference between \"Unmount Volume\" and \"Safe Removal\"? Say you insert a flash drive and open the Disk Utility UI, if you click on \"Safe Removal\" you receive an \"Error Detaching Drive\" notification, because it's busy. You must first click the \"Unmount Volume\" button, and then follow it with the \"Safe Removal\" button. \nA couple questions here: Does this mean all these times I've been \"ejecting\" the drive (via context menu) before removing it, I haven't been \"safely\" removing it? And what are the command line equivalents for the two different operations? \n(This question was somewhat addressed here but the answers seem to contradict what I'm pointing out about the Disk Utility options. Thanks.)\n\nA: \"Unmount\" unmounts a filesystem.  If your USB mass storage device (e.g. USB memory sticks or USB hard disks) contains more than one partition, this will only unmount the filesystem on the currently selected partition.\n\"Safe removal\" does the same as \"eject\" I suppose.  In case of USB mass storage devices it powers down the device, which makes it inaccessible (it will disappear from the device list until you unplug & plug it in again).  Powering down the device before unmounting would have the same result as disconnecting the usb device without unmounting: possible data loss.\nFrom a usability point of view, it would be better if clicking the \"safe removal\" button for a device that still has mounted filesystems on it would just ask if it's okay to unmount those filesystems, or maybe even just do that without asking, because that's most likely what the user wants...\nThe commandline-equivalents of the Disk Utility buttons are:\n\n\n*\n\n*udisks --unmount for the \"Unmount\" button\n\n*udisks --detach for the \"Safe Removal\" button\n\n\nA: Mounting a volume means putting it somewhere in the file system so that it's data becomes available. For example, mounting a flash volume named MyFlash usually creates to a folder named /media/MyFlash from which it's contents can be accessed.\nUnmounting it means making it's data unavailable through the file system. That means either:\n\n\n*\n\n*/media/MyFlash does not exist any more after unmounting, or\n\n*/media/MyFlash is an empty folder\n\n\nAlso you unmount one partition at a time. If you have multiple volumes (partitions) on your drive, you need to unmount each one separately.\n\nSafely removing a drive means the kernel USB module does not care about the drive any more. Any outstanding data that will be written, the device will be powered down (though there will still be voltage going out of the USB port). Only after this has finished should you remove the drive from the USB port.\n\nEven if the kernel writes all it's data through the USB port, some devices, especially external (rotating) hard drives, may buffer this data and not write it to the disk immediately. Just unmounting all partitions and pulling away the USB cable may leave data in these buffers unwritten to disk and thus lost. However, when safely removing the drive the kernel tells the drive to make sure all data is written and waits until the drive confirms to have done so.\n\nTechnical info\nThe kernel associates some special files with devices. Say we have a device /dev/sdc with two partitions /dev/sdc1/ and /dev/sdc1. Mounting and unmounting operations make use of these files and formatting tools use them to write data directly to the partition. But when you \"safely remove\" the drive the kernel no longer associates any /dev/sdc* file with your drive.\nAs long as the drive is not \"safely removed\", but just \"unmounted\" there is still a way for applications and the kernel to write to the disk, and there is no guarantee that the kernel has finished writing it's buffers to disk, or that the disk has finished recoding them.\n\nA: If I use safe removal on a pendrive, then I'm not able to use any other pendrive.

All the sites I've found say to go to apps -> gnome-system-tools -> users, only I'm not seeing gnome-system-tools anywhere.  Any ideas?\n\nA: Before answering the question, I want to comment on the answer of gokulvarma and the conversation between gokulvarma and daniel:\nHaving no sudo permission is not the reason of daniel's failure to add System Tools to Applications menu. He couldn't add it because he tried to add an empty category. System Tools is a category or a sub-menu, if we add an application which will fall under any category, that category is automatically created. On the other hand, if there's nothing under it, we can't create the category; when we try, the tick disappears in some seconds. If we clear all elements under a category, category is cleared automaticaly.\ndaniel tried to add that category by selecting Applications from the left pane and ticking the System Tools from the right pane. Like this:\n\nInstead, he should select System Tools from the left pane -which is already visible there- and he should tick Configuration Editor from the right pane. Like this:\n\nWhen he is done, in his Applications menu, System Tools category/sub-menu should appear with Configuration Editor in it. Like this:\n\nThere's no need to be a sudoer to do this because the tool we are adding can be used by any user to arrange his/her own preferences.\nBut will this tool, Configuration Editor, help daniel to solve his problem? In my opinion, it won't, because this is the same of what he calls gconf-editor. Either via Alt+F2 or via Terminal, gconf-editor command will open that application and it sounds that daniel already can reach that application but he can't find gnome-system-tools in it. He wants to find the gnome-system-tools there in order to reach users section of it.\nIn my Configuration Editor, which can be accessed by comand line as well, I can't see something as gnome-system-tools, too. neither can I find users section. Maybe its somewhere there hidden under some category or it isn't there anymore. (GNOME setting managers have evolved a lot, recently; the sites daniel told about might be a old) lets refer to GNOME System Tools' official documentation: What are the GNOME System Tools? There, among others, we see a screenshot of the tool to manage users and groups:\n\nAnd this is the tool that we know as Users and Groups.(Yes interface is slightly changed, but this is it.) It can be reached via System->Administration. So, there's no need to struggle to reach it from inside other tools. Its there. But as Bobby who commented on the question, I couldn't get well what \"fix show all users\" means.\n\nA: right click on the Menu select Edit Menus and check System tools \n\nA: There was never a sufficient answer.  I ended up doing this through command-line even though tutorials showed it possible through the GUI.  Most of this is moot nowadays as a result of all the GUI updates in the past couple of releases.\n", "Q: Why is Flash performing so badly in 10.10 64-bit compared to 10.04 64-bit? Edit: After discovering some more about the problem (namely that it seems to be caused by waking from suspend) I created a new question.\nIn Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit, I was running the latest 64-bit Flash beta with Google Chrome 64-bit (stable) and I was seeing smooth performance (even in full screen), extremely reasonable CPU usage, and no issues with lock-ups. Compared to my MacBook, the experience was remarkably better. It even solved the issue where hitting volume keys would kick me out of full-screen mode.\nIn 10.10, with (to my knowledge) exactly the same setup, I'm getting ridiculous CPU usage, and full screen performance has gone from perfect to unusable (this is happening because it's flooring a 4-core i5 processor—no small feat). I'm also back to not being able to hit the volume keys without kicking Flash out of full screen and showing a frozen video player until I scroll the window, something that I fixed in 10.04 from overriding the built-in system Flash install (which I think was the 32-bit version with npviewer) with the latest beta.\nThis is on a completely fresh install on a Lenovo X201 (no proprietary drivers). Anyone have any clue what's going on? This is pure speculation, but it feels like this has something to do with hardware acceleration not kicking in properly (the spike in CPU usage would support this).\nThanks!\nEDIT: Some more details: I've noticed that embedded YouTube players flicker annoyingly often, even outside of full-screen mode, which doesn't happen on YouTube pages. Also, even HTML5 videos on YouTube, when put into full-window mode, are somewhat choppy. Movie Player doesn't miss  a beat when playing 1080p videos, so it's possible that this is a Chrome rendering problem, not necessarily a Flash problem.\n\nA: See these tutorials:\nFlash Issues & Solutions\nFlash Optimization\nAlthough they are primarily focused on Firefox, most of the content applies to Chrome as well.\nFor Firefox users with Flash problems, get these two extensions I develop:\nFLASH-AID: remove conflicting flash plugins from Ubuntu Linux systems and install the appropriate version according to system architecture.\nFlashVideoReplacer: this extension replaces embedded flash videos with Quicktime or Windows Media Player compatible videos, allowing to watch flash streaming content with a less CPU intensive plugin, like gecko mediaplayer (recommended),  gxine, kaffeine, mozplugger, totem, xine, vlc (not recommended).    \n\nA: At this point, I'm not 100% why, but after restarting my machine today, the performance seems to be back to how it was in 10.04.\nLooking in my Software Centre history, I'm seeing that compiz, compiz-core, compiz-gnome, compiz-plugins, and libdecoration0 were updated today. I also removed banshee and rhythmbox, which may have touched some graphics library or something (I'm thinking that's a long shot though).\nI'll be sure to update this answer if I ever figure out exactly what the problem was, but in the meantime, I'd say that the Compiz upgrade was likely the fix.\n\nA: On 10.04 the latest version 10.1.102.65 and the square 64bit version suck big time. Flash apps just show blank space in Chrome, which gives the best performance.\nI have to use an older version, 10.0 r45, to get any usability and better performance.\n", "Q: How can I change the default port of Remote Desktop (VNC)? Let's say I went to:\n System > Preferences > Remote Desktop\n\nAnd enable Remote Desktop.  Now let's say I have another machine on the network that is also running a VNC server.  I want to VNC into my network from the outside, but I need each VNC server to be running on different ports.\nHow can I change Ubuntu's default port for Remote Desktop/VNC?\n\nA: Using a little information from the (now dead) Dave's Tech Blog, you can adjust the port setting by going into gconf-editor.\nUnder desktop > gnome > remote access there is a key that says alternative_port and is set to 5900.  Just change the value to what you need.  Then enable the key use_alternative_port.\nThe other option is if your router/firewall support uPnp you can adjust Vino to make the adjustment in the same section of gconf-editor.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reference: How do I use the gconf editor?\n\nA: You can also do this from the command line.\nFor example, to use port 5555, you would use these two commands:\ngconftool-2 --set --type=bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/use_alternative_port true\ngconftool-2 --set --type=int /desktop/gnome/remote_access/alternative_port 5555\n\nNote, if you follow the schema docs, the port should be in the 5000 - 50000 range: \n\n[the alternative_port key is set to] the port which\n  the server will listen to if the \n  'use_alternative_port' key is set to\n  true. Valid values are in the range\n  from 5000 to 50000.\n\n\nA: Under desktop > gnome > remote access there is a key that says alternative_port and is set to 5900. ...of course to do this you need that key to actually exist\n", "Q: ProRes encoding and decoding? Is there a way to encode/decode prores mov files (mostly decode)? I've been playing around with ffmpeg and mencoder/mplayer from the ubuntu repos, but they both report that it's an unknown codec. Totem as well.\nI guess it comes down to getting the right codecs in place. Maybe compiling from source?\nI have seen a few comments on the internet about getting mplayer/mencoder working with prores files in OS X, but I'm hoping there is a way to do this in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Times have certainly changed and now an up to date FFmpeg, including the version packaged with Xenial Xerus LTS,  will now easily encode ProRes files. The following will work well:\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n       -c:v prores -profile:v 3 \\\n       -c:a pcm_s16le \\\n       output.mov\n\nThe available -profile settings are as follows:\n-profile 0 = Apple ProRes Proxy\n-profile 1 = Apple ProRes LT\n-profile 2 = Apple ProRes 422 for SD (lower bitrate)\n-profile 3 = Apple ProRes HQ for HD (higher bitrate)\n\nYou can test your own copy of FFmpeg for ProRes capability as follows:\nandrew@ilium~$ ffmpeg -encoders -hide_banner | grep -i prores\n VF.... prores               Apple ProRes\n VF.... prores_aw            Apple ProRes (codec prores)\n VFS... prores_ks            Apple ProRes (iCodec Pro) (codec prores)\nandrew@ilium~$ \n\n(Note that as my colleague @llogan has mentioned there are actually only two ProRes encoders available: prores_aw (the default aliased to prores) and prores_ks.)\nThe leading letters indicate:\nEncoders:\n V..... = Video\n .F.... = Frame-level multithreading\n ..S... = Slice-level multithreading\n\nFor playback you should find that most of the major media players, examples being MPlayer, SMPlayer and VLC, will happily play these files...\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*9.22 ProRes: FFmpeg docs for the ProRes encoder.

I have a somewhat generic prism2-based wireless card plugged into a PCMCIA adapter. In Lucid it was working with orinoco_cs, or at least that's what it does when I boot Maverick with the Lucid kernel. However the Maverick kernel gives a message about orinoco_cs being disabled for Prism2 cards because the hostap driver supposedly supports them better.\nIt does look like the hostap driver is loading, and I get two devices responding to iwconfig, named wifi0 and wlan2. However they won't seem to connect to the access point. \nI am using manual configuration via /etc/network/interfaces and the command line. At one point when the interface was down I saw iwconfig report that wlan2 had in fact connected to the access point, but when I ran ifup wlan2 it disconnected from the AP and the rate changed back to 2M. The encryption key in the interfaces file is the same one I gave on the iwconfig command line. Further command line poking did not seem to get things associated.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: I installed hostap-utils. By itself that was not enough. Then I did the following:\n(a) Changed the interfaces file to use some of the hostap_utils commands instead of some of the iwconfig-related entries.\n\nauto wlan2\niface wlan2 inet static\naddress desired ip\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway desired gateway address\nwireless-essid my network id\n# wireless-mode managed\n# wireless-key my network key\n# wireless-rate 11M\nup prism2_param wlan2 oper_rates 15\nup prism2_param wlan2 ap_auth_algs 2\nup hostap_crypt_conf wlan2 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff WEP my network key\n\n(b) hostap_cs was creating two network devices which were not quite independent. In the interfaces file I had settings for only one of them. From /var/log/daemon.log it looked like NetworkManager was trying to claim the other. I added an entry for it, rebooted, and the network seems OK now.\n", "Q: Autoconnecting Bluetooth Devices Is there a way to set the Bluetooth in Ubuntu to autoconnect to devices it is paired to when it is turned on.  Furthermore, is there a way to automatically change the sound output to a Bluetooth headset on connection?\n\nA: Pulseaudio >= 1.0\nBy editing the /etc/pulse/default.pa we can load the pulseaudio module module-switch-on-connect to autoconnect to an audio sink as soon as it is presented to the pulseaudio  sound server. We need to insert the following line\nload-module module-switch-on-connect\n\nPrevious versions of pulseaudio\nBluetooth devices are recognized in PulseAudio as soon as they are present. However connection needs to be made manually in audio settings. There is a GUI that allows one-click connection to BT devices (stream2ip). \nEdit: From version 0.2.5 stream2ip allows auto-connecting to Bluetooth devices.\nEdit: you can set up your bluez device as default device (e.g. by using pactl or in the config settings) with fallback to internal audio if no bluetooth device is present.\nEdit: Here is a quick and dirty Python script to give you an idea on how to do the job:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n#-*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n#\n# bt-autoconnect\n# Autoconnects Bluetooth Devices to PulseAudio\n# (c) Takkat Nebuk\n# Licence: GPLv3\n# usage:\n# bt-autoconnect <MAC> <timeout>\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\nimport string\n\ncli_options = sys.argv\n\ndef main():\n    MAC = cli_options[1]\n    timeout = cli_options[2]\n    PMAC = string.replace(MAC,':','_') # PA don't know ':', needs '_'\n    pa_args = ['pacmd set-default-sink bluez_sink.' + PMAC]\n    bt_args = ['sdptool browse ' + MAC]\n    err = False\n    while err == False:\n        if subprocess.call(bt_args, shell=True) == 0:\n            err = subprocess.call(pa_args, shell=True)\n        time.sleep(int(timeout))\n    exit()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nJust copy this script and save it as bt-autoconnect.py. Make the script executable or run it from command line (recommended) by cd /script/directory and then type:\npython bt-autoconnect.py [MAC] [timeout]\n\nReplace MAC by the MAC of your Bluetooth device (e.g. 00:0C:78:4F:B6:B5) and set a desired timeout (e.g. 10) in seconds when the script looks for the device. This script will then listen to the given MAC every timeout seconds for a Bluetooth device and connects it to PulseAudio if present. The script will run forever until it's being killed or the virtual terminal was closed.\nSometimes PulseAudio seems not to be aware of the device being present again after it has been switched out. With some hope pulseaudio -k makes it reappear. \nNot fancy, no GUI but at least in my settings it worked o.k..\nEdit for those interested: bt-autoconnect with GUI for convenient setup is released. Please file bugs or suggestions there.

But the reason of the stall is quite simple: the meaning of \"@ms\" variable is inverse to intuitive, and inverse to what they've written in org.gnome.Terminal.gschema.xml.\n@ms should contain the only characters, ALLOWED to select by double-click.\nSo, if you DON'T want dashes or colons or smth to select, you may enter:\nUUID=$(gsettings get org.gnome.Terminal.ProfilesList default | tr -d \\')\ndconf write /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:${UUID}/word-char-exceptions \"@ms '_^'\"\n\nChange works immediately, retains through reset; but for different profile, you should repeat the command.\n", "Q: Why does redirection to the same file truncate the file? Normally we use a different file to redirect the output.\nFor example :\ncat < first > temp\n\nIn this command the contents of first are redirected to temp instead of the standard output.\nThen why does it truncates the file if I use the same file name?\nWhy can't it overwrite the same file?\ncat < first > first \n\n\nA: When you use I/O redirection like that, both the \"input\" & \"output\" file are opened by the shell before the command is executed.  And opening a file for overwriting is the same as truncating it before writing.  The result: cat sees an empty file on input...\n\nA: Because handling it in the general case would be very complicated. Just consider the following example:\nA program reads a file line by line and outputs each line twice. Now for this to work without a second file (ie on the same file) the program would need to buffer most (all) of the lines which it will read, since they will be overwritten otherwise before they can be read.\nTo keep matters simple programs usually use a secondary, temporary file which they move over the original once they are finished. This is for example how sed -i (inline) works.\n\nA: Typically the syntax for redirecting in this is case should be cat first > temp.  This means that cat's output of first is sent to the file of temp.  In the case of your statement cat < first > temp, the output cat has not been completed at the time it is redirected to out again.  Nothing in results in nothing out.\nHowever cating a file and the output redirected to another file is no different than a basic cp.\n", "Q: How can I preserve the executable bit on a file that is synchronized by Ubuntu One?

You can click Subscribe on the top right to have it email progress to you.\n\nA: Currently Ubuntu One does not sync metadata about files (last modified time, permissions).

Even though the script could be executed with the command line, run-parts rejected it saying \"Exec format error\". \nChanging the file name from scriptname.sh to scriptname and adding the #!/bin/bash into first line enabled my script to run hourly.\n\nA: Your problem is probably down to the overly open permissions, which allows anybody to edit your file.  Try 755 instead.\nLooking in the cron entries in your syslog output should confirm this.\n\nA: Entries in cron.hourly are run by the run-parts mechanism (man run-parts for more info).  And run-parts is choosy about what filenames it considers valid.\nFor example, giving your script an extension will make it invalid and result in the job not being run. [a-zA-Z0-9_-] are the valid characters, so the '.' makes it invalid. \nWhen adding a job to /etc/cron.hourly ( or .daily, .weekly, etc), always test afterwards that run-parts will actually run it by issuing the command:  \nrun-parts --test /etc/cron.hourly\n\nIf by running this command it shows your file it means it worked.

How can i reestablish a Tunnel if my localhost goes down?\ni have 2 machines, Remotehost and localhost, on my localhost im running autossh to keep the tunnel alive in case of network problems.\nautossh -M 20000 -L 3300:192.168.2.101:3306 -R 3000:192.168.1.3:3000 disp@192.168.2.100 -p 80\n\nbut what if i need to reboot the localhost? how do i auto reconnect the tunnel then?\n\nA: Another simple option is to add @reboot autossh ... & to /etc/cron.d/autossh\n\nA: Put the command to establish the tunnel in some script which is executed on boot. You could use /etc/rc.local, you could write your own init script in /etc/init or /etc/init.d, or more elegantly, you could write a script in /etc/network/if-up.d. The last option executes the script after the network interface comes up.\n", "Q: How can I calibrate the touch screen and stylus on HP Pavillion TX 2500? I installed Kubuntu 10.10 on a HP tx2675ee tablet PC (tx2500 series - single touch not multi touch). The touch screen and stylus both work out of the box, however the touch screen is way off calibration wise and the stylus is just a bit out of whack. \nHow do I calibrate these input methods?\nThere are posts here and elsewhere referring to editing this path:\n/usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-wacom.conf, but on Kubuntu 10.10 I can't find that file or it's parent directory.\nThanks.\n\nA: You could go an grab the xinput calibrator which will allow you to get the calibration values for the touchscreen. After that you can set those values using xinput.\nYou can acquire a full list of devices with xinput list, a list of all properties of the device with xinput list-props $device_id. There should be a property like Evdev Axis Calibration which you can set like this:\nxinput set-prop 12 \"Evdev Axis Calibration\" 0 4132 0 4135\n\n", "Q: Is there a good mono-spaced font for Devanagari script in the Terminal? All the terminal fonts I have tried result in inaccurate rendering of the Devanagari sript (and/or Roman script) in the Terminal\nIn the Devanagari script, a vowel binds itself to a preceding consonant. This type of vowel does not exist on its own. The dotted circle indicates that it requires a preceding consonant...\nHere is an example of an as yet unattached vowel: VOWEL SIGN O'\nProper font rendering  does the work of grafting the consonanat to the vowel, and should remove all visible signs of the dotted-circle.... \n...but I can't find a Terminal font which renders both the Roman script and Devanagari scripts satisfactorily. Actually, the dotted-circle still shows for ALL Devanagari fonts, and the Roman script is not rendered properly for many of those fonts; eg. in the word \"Primer\", about 40% of the \"e\" overlaps the \"m\".\nIs there some way around this?\nDoes anyone know of a suitable font?... Mono-spaced is preferred.\nOr is it something to do with the Ubuntu - gnome-terminal setup?  \nUpdate 2:\n  I tried the same text in openSUSE (gnome-terminal): it failed worse than Ubuntu.\n  I tried the same text in Fedora (Konsole): it rendered PERFECTLY!\n  but that's Fedora, and I'm using Ubuntu :(\n  okay, then next obvious step:\n  I installed Konsole in Ubuntu: it rendered PERFECTLY!\n  but that's Konsole, and I'd rather stay in the gnome family... and Konsle's menu doesn't respond to keyboard... and If Ubuntu+Konsole can do it, then there is probably a way Ubuntu+gnome-terminal can...\nUpdate 1:\n  As suggeseted, here are some examples.\n  The Devanagari looks okay here, but not in the termainal (the .png below shows the Monospace font) \n30 - Uncle moon – चंदा मामा/20081119 Hindi Primer part 30 - Uncle moon – चंदा मामा.nag\n31 - Rain Queen - वर्षा रानी/20081124 Hindi Primer part 31 - Rain Queen - वर्षा रानी.nag\n\n\nActually, NONE of the Devanagari-aware fonts render correctly!\n...and some of the the Roman script rendering can get pretty whacky.  \nAll entries from the command $ locale are set to \"en_AU.UTF-8\", but even setting everything to \"hi_IN.UTF-8\" makes no difference  \n\nA: I reckon that this is a bug, and is beyond a simple \"choose a better font\" issue.  \nThe same fonts, including the default Monospace, work fine in all other apps I've tried.\nand Devanagari fonts doesn't render properly in Fedora's gnome-terminal either,\nbut the same fonts works in KDE's Konsole and also in Konsole running in Ubuntu.  \nI don't know how to follow a reported and accepted bug, but I found a reference to a gnome-terminal / Devanagari issue (from December of 2008)... and perhaps this is the same issue.  \nvte (Ubuntu)  low (priority)   Assigned to: Ubuntu Desktop Bugs\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/vte/+bug/310053 \n...and now that I've played with Konsole a bit more, it has revealed some really nice features... especially  Search Output with Regex... wow! Just what I wanted...  and the lack of menu-accelerator Keys don't matter, becaue it has fully Kustomizable short-cut Keys... I'm Konverted....  and I've found my good mono-space font. It is called Monospace :)  \n\nA: In case of GNOME Terminal (VTE) the problem was not the font; the problem was that VTE used to render each cell independently, including a Devanagari spacing combining mark separately from the base letter. This was fixed in VTE version 0.56.\n", "Q: After song #6 I get the first 5 songs but in inverted order with rhythmbox I noticed an oddity in Rhythmbox Last.fm integration. Namely, when I load a radio station \"similar to artist XX.YY\" the player loads a list of ten songs, but from #6 to #10 they are a repetition of #1 to #5 in inversed order. Is it a problem with Rhythmbox?\n\nA: This happens when you double-click the station to load the music selection, if you select it once and wait a second for the station to deliver the song queue, you'll only get them once. I have the same issue, and patience is the only work-around I've found.\n", "Q: Stupid simple music player? Here's what I want: I have a folder with MP3 files. I would like to play all the files in the folder, alphabetically. And I need a way to pause, skip to next file, and that's pretty much it.\nI don't want to use my music player to organize my music library, I don't need connection to network services, and I don't even need ID3 support.\nOn Windows, WinAmp 2 did what I wanted. What's my best option on Ubuntu?\n\nA: You could use Totem, you can load/save playlists and it's pretty straight forward (and installed by default).\nEdit: You might also want to have a look at XMMS, which is pretty similar to WinAmp.\n\nA: For your situation I'd recommend DeadBeeF. It's light, fast and, silly name aside, it can do exactly what you want. Just point the player to the folder you want to play, arrange the files alphabetically via the 'Title' column and let it play your music.\n\nA: I have been using exaile music player like it a lot\n\nA: There is nothing stupid about a light, simple and fast player that will do quickly what you want, namely: playing straightly your music with no concern for looks or supplementary capacities.\nThe problem is that a lot of simple players are just stupid. They crush, or won't natively open flac, ape or cue files and such, or, if you add them the needed plugins to play them, they crush after that etc.\nYou want a simple player like winamp?\nQMMP is the one for that. \n(some that pretend to be simpler are so simple that you might end losing a lot of time with simplest tasks)\n\nIt supports Winamp x2 skins ;)\n\nsudo apt-get install qmmp\n\nBut so it happens that the best player around is also the lightest and simplest if you do not need addons/plugins - it is still light and fast with all that, and that's why it is the best; but anyway:\nDeaDBeeF (I prefer the static/portable version) - here\n\nNo skins for this one ;) but colors are changeable.\nConsidering Winamp itself: why not try it in Wine? It seems fast and light. Unless you want to try the real best player for Windows, and, through Wine, a serious favorite as the best in Linux: Foobar2000. (See related answer.)\n\n(But I'm curious: why would one want to play music files alphabetically?? In case your needs of just playing alphabetically one folder of mp3 files have become more complex in time, you might consider editing your question.)\nYou might use Fooobar2000 to edit track number(among other things) in bulk with the masstagger. Let's say I have some tracks with no number in tags but that are put in the correct order because of the name\n \nOpening them in FB2k\n\nIn the new window click 'Add'\n\nIn the other small window click ok (leave empty)\nWith 'Auto track number' enabled there click 'Run'. It's done.\nA good player should only look simple!\n\nA: Straight out, I'd say use Rhythmbox (It's installed by default). It automatically scans your music folder and adds files when you drop them in there. Nothing fancy, it just works.\n\nA: I would recommend cmus! It is a console-only player, and quite flexible when it comes to alphabetic ordering. To add all files in a directory, use:\n\n\n*\n\n*:add ~/my_music (replace ~/my_music with your actual music folder)\n\n*:set lib_sort=filename (if you only want to sort by directory/filename)\n\n\nA: If you are looking for something lightweight than Rhytmbox, then try audacious\nsudo apt-get install audacious\n\nIt is also present in Ubuntu Software Center.\nHTH\n\nA: I'd recommend decibel-audio-player. Simple, lightweight, efficient and made just to play music. Best replace for winamp2 for me.\nIt's available through standard repository and at launchpad.\n\nA: Personally I use moc in such cases. If you don’t mind it being in text mode, I recommend it.\n\nA: Try moosic which has no ui at all. ;-)\n(Well, it has a ui, but it can run in the background as a daemon.)\n\nA: mplayer - simply fire up a console and put in: mplayer /path_to_mp3s/*.mp3\nYou can control it by keyboard, <spacebar> to pause, <page up> to skip to next song etc.\nIt's console based, so you can set up convenient aliases for it. For example: \nalias mp3='mplayer *.mp3' plays all mp3 in current directory.\n\nA: Why not the elementary OS music player, Noise?\nIt is vary straight-forward and easy to use. It is not super stable yet though.\n", "Q: 10.04 > 10.10 upgrade and the splash screen hangs I have a computer that once I upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 the splash screen hangs. I had this issue on another machine that I simply boot into recovery mode and reinstalled the nvidia drivers (both have nvidia cards).\nThe thing is, on the machine I'm presently having issues with, when I select recovery mode, the monitor tells me \"No Signal\"\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, this is a friend's laptop needed for University.\n\nA: As a workaround you can try booting up without Plymouth (the splash screen) by editing grub on boot up. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold Shift on startup to access the GRUB menu.\n\n*Press any key (besides Enter) to stop the timer. Then select the menu entry (normally the newest) by using the arrow keys.\n\n*Press e at the desired item to go into edit mode.\n\n*Go to the second from last line (by using the arrow keys). It should say something like: linux /boot/vmlinux-2.6.31-9 root=UUID=904b4c85-9857 ro quiet splash (it will not be exactly the same).\n\n*Remove the quiet splash options from the line, so it ends in ro.\n\n*Press Ctrl+x to boot. Hopefully it will work!\n\n", "Q: mount error during boot up I get the following error during boot up.
