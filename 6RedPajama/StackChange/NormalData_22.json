["Q: Group messaging using an iPhone Is there a way to send group messages on the iPhone without an app? And without individually choosing the contact in the group?\n\nA: The iPhone's built-in Messages app can send group messages: open the app, go to the messages list, hit the Compose Message button in the upper-right corner, and use the Add (+) icon in the To: field to add multiple recipients.\nYou cannot, however, add an entire group as a message recipient; multiple recipients must be added one at a time.\n", "Q: Method for using F4 key without pressing function button on MacBook Pro I'm using a program that uses the F4 key as an important shortcut which I use heavily.\nEvery time I want to press F4 on my MacBook Pro also have to press the fn button.\nIs there a possibility (such as with an AppleScript?) that something could detect if I'm using that program and allow me to avoid pressing fn and let me use the shortcut just with the F4 key?\n\nA: Palua\nPalua lets you change all function keys for individual apps.\n\nWith Palua, you just need one click - or one hotkey - to toggle the mode your Fx keys are.\n\n\nFunctionFlip\nFunctionFlip can 'flip' certain function keys only instead of changing all keys, but it works for all apps.\n\nFunctionFlip individually controls your MacBook or MacBook Pro's function keys, turning special keys back to regular F-keys, or vice-versa.\n\n\n\nFunctionFlip's purpose is simply to disable the special features — rewind, play, mute, etc. — on the function keys. For example, if you \"flip\" F7, F8, and F9, those keys — only those keys — will revert back to normal F keys. Press the fn key with the special key to get the special function back. That is, the \"special\" and \"normal\" functions are flipped.\n\n\nA: You could also use KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <appdef>\n    <appname>TEXTEDIT</appname>\n    <equal>com.apple.TextEdit</equal>\n  </appdef>\n  <item>\n    <name>flipf4</name>\n    <identifier>flipf4</identifier>\n    <only>TEXTEDIT</only>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD, KeyCode::F4</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F4, KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nSee the source for the key code values and predefined settings.\n\nA: The \"Use all F1...\" method is probably the best way to go. It'll be mildly inconvenient in other applications, but it may make sense for your use case.\n\nA: Very simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Apple at the top left of the Mac Menu\n\n*Click \"System Preferences...\"\n\n*Select the Keyboard Icon\n\n*Check the \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard key functions\".\n\n\nA: How about using the default Excel for Mac shortcut?\n⌘ + Y\n", "Q: Will use of FireVault reduce lifetime of SSD? I want to setup my FileVault in Retina MacBook Pro 13. Will it reduce lifetime of my SSD a lot?\n\nA: I can't see file vault impacting the life of the drive since it's a block level encryption and doesn't add or subtract any overhead in terms of what data is written.\nPut another way, if you asked - \"Does writing 80% zeroes to a drive reduce the life of the drive over writing 80% ones?\" the answer would also be no. The life of the drive is based on power on hours and write volume and not the exact values of the data being written.\n", "Q: Java class file could not be launched on startup I'm not sure what happened but now when I boot up my Mac I get this message that pops up every time: \n\"The Java class file \"myClass.class\" could not be launched.\nCheck the Console for possible error messages.\"\nThis class file is part of a larger program I'm developing. \nI checked the console and found the message with sender [0x0-0x1b01b].com.apple.JarLauncher and the message says java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: .... \nI failed to find the Jar Launcher or anything Java related in /Library/StartupItems and ~/Library/StartupItems but that's all I thought to do.\nAny ideas on why I'm getting this message and what to do to get rid of it?\n\nA: Finally found it in System Preferences -> Users -> Login items.\n", "Q: How to access IPhoto on my external hard drive I can't access my Iphoto libraries from my hard drive. Every time I go to open the IPhoto file in the hard drive the error pops up as follows:\n\"You can't open Iphoto Back up because it is in Time Machine\"\nand when I try to open Iphoto with the Hard Drive plugged in the following error pops up:\n\"The iPhoto Library is a Time Machine backup, and so cannot be used as the main library.  Relaunch iPhoto with  key held down to choose another library.\"\nI followed the directions but there is no library to choose. I'm not sure if I am going about the correctly but I am wondering if my time machine isn't compatible with Iphoto.\n\nA: Right click the iPhoto library, pick \"show package contents\" then open the folder \"Masters\" or \"Originals\". They'll be organized by date in there. You can just drag the entire \"Masters\" folder into your new iPhoto and they'll get imported.\n", "Q: Both Safari and Webkit crash on startup I'm trying to debug a Webkit problem, and I seem to have botched my Safari installation: whenever I try to launch any version of Safari or Webkit, it crashes immediately with an error like this:\n\nDyld Error Message:\n    Library not loaded: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WebKit2.framework/Versions/A/WebKit2\n    Referenced from: /System/Library/StagedFrameworks/Safari/Safari.framework/Safari\n    Reason: image not found\n\nI wasn't able to reproduce my bug in my installed Safari (6.0.5 on Mountain Lion (10.8.4)) but I was on the Webkit nightly I downloaded and installed (r151773). \nI was trying to pinpoint the Webkit revision where this became a problem, so I downloaded several more older nightlies, but when I tried launching any of those, they failed to launch with the error above. When I went back to the newer nightly, then to my original Safari, those were all showing the error as well.\nI can't find an installer to reinstall Safari 6.0.5. In this answer I found a route to download and install a developer build of Safari 6.1, but that also fails to launch with the same error.\nHow can I restore my Safari? And, once I get Safari back, is there a way to try several nightlies of Webkit so I can narrow down the scope of the change which created my problem?\n\nA: You could try doing an upgrade install of OS X from the recovery partition. It should replace preinstalled frameworks and applications with the initial versions but keep user files and settings in place. I have done it twice so far and it solved multiple issues both times, so I have started to recommend it as a troubleshooting step here, even though no-one ever does it.\nAnother way to restore the directories for Safari or frameworks might be to copy them from a VM.\n", "Q: need more memory on my phone I have the iphone 5 ios 6 and I have two backups on there and it tells me \nI need to delete one of my backups. Would this delete my stuff already on my device even if it says that it will delete  all backup data from icloud?\n\nA: No it will not delete the data from your phone. A backup is stored on your PC/Mac or on iCloud but the backup is just a reference copy of what is already on your phone. Deleting a backup will not delete the current data on your phone.\n\nA: If you need more memory on your iPhone 5 you could try resetting the iphone and delete everything, or known as try deleting all of the cache, Cache's are logs and files you don't need.\nMake sure you have some iCloud Backups,\nhttp://forums.imore.com/iphone-5/246764-how-clear-cache-make-ios-faster.html\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2401354,00.asp\nhttp://ergonomics.hubpages.com/hub/6-Ways-to-Make-the-Most-Out-of-Your-iPhone-5\n", "Q: How do I update Safari on the Macintosh? How do I upgrade Safari on the Mac?\nIs there one web page to always get the current version?\nOr are there instructions somewhere for how to manually update Safari (assuming auto update is not enabled)\n\nA: I assume that you would go to the apple menu and click Software Update.  This will launch the App Store and search for updates for all your software.  If there is new software out there, it will show up.\nOr, alternatively, you can go here: http://www.apple.com/support/safari/ and click the update link.\ndp\n", "Q: Portable Firefox for Mac If some person tells me how to have a nice portable Firefox on my Mac, this person will have my eternal gratitude.\n\nA: While I have written a portable version of Google Chrome for Windows, Chrome and Firefox have similar file structure, I'll give this semi tutorial a go..\nFirst, copy your /Applications/Firefox.app to a folder named \"Firefox\" on a flash drive.\nNow, locate a valid user profile for Firefox on your Mac (usually ~/Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/ or \n~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/ )\nCopy a valid profile folder to this \"Firefox\" folder also.\nNext, we will create a Bash script to properly open Portable Firefox, so..\nInside this \"Firefox\" folder create a \"start.sh\" with the following lines:\n /Volumes/<FLASHDRIVENAME>/Firefox/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox -profile /Volumes/<FLASHDRIVENAME>/Firefox/<profile folder>\n\nIf you execute \n$ bash /Volumes/<FLASHDRIVENAME>/Firefox/start.sh\n\nYou should be able to run Firefox on any Mac anywhere.\nNOTE: Replace < FLASHDRIVENAME > with the mountable name of your flash drive.\n\nA: The version Firefox v22 for Mac at http://portableapps.com/node/37665 is stable.\nI use it and it works great.  \n", "Q: How can I reset iPhone camera roll to IMG_0001.jpg? I really want to reset the iPhone camera roll to photo IMG_0001.jpg. I have tried to do it with Image Capure, iExplorer and PhoneView, but any of them did not work at all. Is there a way to clear previous history saved on iPhone (when I take picture, my camera roll starts with IMG_0002.jpg) and to make camera roll to be reset without needing to erase all content and settings?\n\nA: At the risk of you having done the steps, here is how it worked in the past using PhoneView:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off the phone.\n\n*Connect to USB and let it start (this way the camera app and others are not accessing the camera roll).\n\n*Launch PhoneView and in the settings turn on Show Entire Disk (Advanced Disk Mode)\n\n*Delete all pictures, files, folders from inside DCIM _(such as .MISC and 100APPLE, 101APPLE, etc... leaving just the DCIM folder empty).\n\n*Edit the PhotoData > MISC > DCIM_APPLE.plist file to set things to 0000 and 100 as desired in the xml file.\n\n*Disconnect the USB and power down the phone, never once tapping on any apps while you shuffled things under the OS and the Camera app.\n\n*Power on the phone and take a picture.\n\n\n    DCIMLastDirectoryNumber\n    100\n    DCIMLastFileNumber\n    251\n\n\n\nA: The following procedure works in 2019 to set the picture number of iPhones to an arbitrary number:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install iExplorer 2.2.1.16 (the last free version, search for \"iexplorer 2.2.1.6\").\n\n*Get all photos from the iPhone and clear all photos from the iPhone as you would usually do when retrieving all photos from the iPhone (e.g. using the Digital Pictures app). \n\n*Close all apps on the iPhone.\n\n*Connect via USB and launch iExplorer.\n\n*Delete all folders Media/DCIM/10[456789]APPLE when setting image number to 3000. Otherwise the highest existing directory name will set the starting image number (e.g. 108APPLE for 8000).\n\n*Get file PhotoData/MISC/DCIM_APPLE.plist via drag and drop.\n\n*Edit file DCIM_APPLE.plist. Change DCIMLastFileNumber and DCIMLastDirectoryNumber to your needs.

I'm only doing normal browsing and the fans are at 6000RPM. Quite strange. \nI have MacBook Pro mid 2010 model. I have tried to reset the SMC by holding shift+ctrl+alt+power.\nIt happens in OSX and in Win7 (Bootcamp).\nThe outside temperature in the past few days is around 33C which is a lot more than usual (summer is here:).. but still it's weird because this could only affect Mac running a bit hotter and not fan speeds being higher at some given temperature.\nSensor being faulty or fan being clogged up also can't be a reason.. only thing I see that could cause this is some fault in the controlling logic but SMC reset should have taken care of this...\nAny ideas? Hmm now when the computer is completely idle the temperature shows 63C and the fans are at 3500RPM - so only a small temperature difference and 2500RPM difference in fan speed... :S The whole thing is strange.\nthank you!\ndavid\n\nA: If you are confident with opening the case of your machine and blowing some canned air at it, this is said to take care of the dust accumulation that can cause overheating. Certainly no harm in it. \n\nA: While I'm not sure why this may be happening, I have a solution: smcFanControl. It's a little program that sits in your menu bar and lets you directly control the fan speed. OS X will override it when your machine gets too hot, so there's no danger in setting the speed to the minimum.\nI also have a mid-2010 Macbook Pro and have been running the program since I got it.\nSome pictures:\n\n\nPretty straightforward and simple.\n", "Q: Automator Service with Google Translate I set up an Automator Service that receives selected text and then runs a simple shell script to pass the text to open google translate:\nopen https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/\"$@\"\n\nIt opens google translate just fine, but doesn't pass the text along with it. How can I fix?\ngoogle translate service\n\nA: It worked for me as long as pass input was set to as arguments.

Every once in a while Finder will freeze up for no readily-identifiable reason. You can click in open windows, but if you change the folder you're looking at it won't display the files. Open File dialogs in programs don't work, either, they just display the Favorites along the left side, and maybe a directory path, but you can't select anything. More often than not, either immediately or eventually you'll get the spinning beach ball of death. I haven't found anything in the Console, but maybe I don't know what to look for.\nIf you Force Quit, either through the Apple menu, by click-holding on the Dock, or by entering killall Finder in Terminal, the process does not restart. Files disappear from the desktop and don't come back, and the little highlight below the Doc icon (indicating a program is running) is not there. If you click on the Finder icon the highlight appears, but the Finder windows don't, nor do the desktop items. Running open /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app doesn't work, either. The only way I've found to get it running normally again is to reboot, but there are problems there, too. I'm not sure if it's related to the Finder issue, but if the computer has been running for more than, say, an hour or two, selecting Restart from the Apple menu doesn't actually reboot the computer, it just hangs for a while on the grey screen, without getting to the shutdown log, so I need to do a hard reboot by holding in the power key for a second or two. Sometimes the Finder crash will be so bad that I can't even get to the Restart option, and have to hard reboot right from the GUI.\nAny help or suggestions you could give would be very much appreciated!\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem on a MacBook Air, 13\" late 2010 running 10.8.4 (12E55).

Macbook pro retina The problem is - high pitched noisy tiny sound that u can hear only using more or less quality headphones. I use yamaha rh-5ma. And it's not the problem of headphones because I have different ones (sennheiser 555) and I can test in with different players like iphone or whatever. You won't hear this sound connecting standard iphone's earphones because the problem I hear is too faint for Apple's headphones to reproduce since they are lower quality than my preferred headphones.\nSo to make this sound on your mbp connect your headphones and then start to play something (youtube/itunes/anything that makes sound and basically activates the sound card) and then stop it. You'll hear this high pitched noise. The moment of start/stop playback can cause some different pitched artefacts. On different machines it goes in different way. Like in my MBP I have it in right ear but it's pritty annoying to ignore it. Like a tiny moskito. In different mbp i tried it it was less amplified but in two channels (left and right).\nThe problem is that not everyone is able to hear this sounds because not everyone hear this high frequency. (approx 14-17khz, can't really measure it because don't have that precise recording device). \nWhat can I do to know if my Mac has a problem that can be fixed?\n\nA: If your amplifier in your Mac is making audible noises, you should take it in for service. These very new machines should all be under warranty and at the genius bar, they should be able to test your headphones on another Mac and your Mac to be sure yours is normal.\nMany audiophile insist on external DAC when there is noise from the CPU or other components since many properly built and functioning computers have noisy amplifiers. Yours should be as good as the rest of the population but perhaps no better than the rest. Just like all LCD displays are not perfect, there are some things you just have to live with, but without hearing your specific Mac it's hard to tell if your expectations are too high or if your hardware is less performant than a typical Mac of that design.\nThe best way to get Apple to examine any problem is to ask them to examine your specific problem. Especially if you can show noise being generated no matter the signal being played - that would point to a faulty amplifier / grounding issue / crosstalk interference issue as opposed to a problem with a particular music file or genre of music and the Digital-to-Analog chipset that was chosen by Apple. A repair or swap can fix the former, but you can't expect them to redesign the line if you don't like how it was made in the first place.\n", "Q: How do I convert a 24-bit/96 kHz FLAC to anything else?

Please help?\n\nA: Without knowing if your charge is dead, try using a USB cable connected to your Mac, to charge it that way.\n\nTo charge iPod, connect it directly to a computer's USB port (not a\n  keyboard) and make sure standby, hibernation, or sleep mode is turned\n  off.

From now on it will ask you to confirm and will not play all the garbage automatically.\n\nIn case you want to do this:\nChrome > Settings > Privacy > Content Settings, scroll down and click on the Plug ins Click to Play.\n\nA: A huge battery drain is Flash (as Buscar mentioned), and although disabling it is one solution, it impedes too much functionality of the web. I would recommend Click to Flash, a free Safari extension. It disables flash, but can resume it on click (just like in Buscar's answer). However, it can also replace most online flash video players with a quicktime plug in, that uses many times less CPU. It's great for YouTube, which runs video's in an appallingly terrible player that easily uses over 1/4 of a dual core machine.\n\nA: Make sure you don't have any legacy Adobe software installed.

I know it's possible to have an Airport Express create a wireless network by connecting it to my router (through enthernet cable).\nBut can it act as AirPlay at the same time?\n\nA: Yes, that is in fact the purpose of the AirPlay feature. Just plug it to your stereo or active speaker with the jack on the rear.

I'm planning to swap out my early 2011 MBP's drive for a larger capacity one. I'm running Mac OS 10.7.5.\nI have available a 1 TB external USB-connected drive that I'm using for Time Machine backups.\nI also have a SATA-to-USB adapter.\nI'm pretty sure I have a compatible OS X install disk that I could boot from.\nSo given all that, what would be the most efficient way to get my old system onto the new drive? Should I copy it onto there before or after putting it into the machine?\nWould the Time Machine backup help me out in any way?\n\nA: A few ways to approach....\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone your existing drive to a drive image on the 1TB (if it has room). As @revolver mentioned, Carbon Copy Cloner is a good tool. Super Duper does very much the same thing. Your choice. Swap drives and then restore. You'll need a boot drive that has your clone tool. The 1TB could do this, or a flash drive, etc. \n\n*Plug the new drive into the USB/SATA adapter. Install OS X on the new drive so you get the recovery partition setup properly. Then clone directly from internal to external drive. No drive image involved. You can even reboot while in this config to confirm everything worked. Then swap the hardware. \n\n*Run a Time Machine backup. Install the new drive. Install OS X, with its recovery partition. Boot to the recovery partition and restore from Time Machine.\n\n*Install OS X on the new drive and use the Migration Assistant tool to move all your data and apps over from Time Machine backup. This has the advantages of removing some cruft and getting you a \"fresher\" environment.\nI'd pick #2 as you can test the new drive before you commit to the hardware install. \n\nA: I will use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone my current HDD to the one I am swapping to. Easiest solution in my opinion. \n", "Q: my apple developers account is rejected this is what pops up when i click the email link. \"We are unable to activate your Apple Developer Program membership.

Call 1-800-MY-APPLE and give them your web order number.\n\nIn this case, the developer program is sold exclusively through the Apple online web store, so start with calling the toll free or local number for your Apple store and give them your order number.

You may have to fax or email them legal documents, a copy of your driver's license or other government ID. This process is emailed to you and you have to sign in using the Apple ID from step one - not the one from step 2 (should they be different).\n\n*You then have to agree to certain legal terms relating to NDA, tax rules, electronic communication legal agreements, etc... and use the original Apple ID to signify that you agree to all Apple's terms.\n\n\nIf you didn't get the email to start step 4 - you have to deal with the Apple Store people at 1-800-MY-APPLE or your local store contact.

Keep in mind that signing up for the account and using the beta subjects you to a non-disclosure agreement that limits your ability to discuss the beta.\n\nA: The official version of iOS 7 is not released yet. Only when you have a developer's ID ($99/yr) can you install the beta version of iOS 7. \nThough you can download the leaked developer's version online and install it on a jailbroken device, it is not recommended and is illegal. \n\nA: As a lot of folks mentioned, you can after paying the 100 bucks developer account.\nBut i do not recommend it, it's really not for primary devices and/or consumer usage.\nYou wouldn't be satisfied with the user experience, it's really not finished yet.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible - but I will not go into how.\n$99 a year is not that expensive, so it is foolish to \"cheat\"\n", "Q: What in the world is happening on Handbrake on my Mac? I have used handbrake once successfully, to rip my first season of Boardwalk Empire to my Mac. But now any time after that first successful try, it gives me images like this:  where it is all pixelated and the fading between scenes is very jagged-y. What is happening now?\n\nA: Did you remove the VLC player ?\nBecause HandBrake no longer includes the libraries needed to decrypt commercial DVDs, you’ll also need to install the VLC media player. \nTo get the 64-bit benefits from HandBrake, you’ll need to have a 64-bit version of VLC as well. \nThe standard download is a Universal Binary and contains both 32- and 64-bit code for Intel Macs—if you want to save some disk space, you can download the VLC specific version here.\n\nA: I installed the latest version of VLC and libdvdcss and this solved the pixelated issues.

They are labeled 130 and 140 in the picture.\n\nDoes anyone have a clue what the white things under the key are named and where I can buy a cheap replacement?\n\nA: They are sometimes called scissor clips. I have bought them from thebookyard.com, which is a Mac parts seller based in the UK. Apple is known to replace them for free as a walk up service at the Genius Bar and you of course can order official repair parts from a variety of sources. \nBe aware that different keys on the same keyboard can have minute differences in the layout and size of these supporting clips even when the key cap size is identical.\n\nA: Alright, it turned out that I'm looking for a so called B-Clip\nThe number of this piece is 221159039672 If you type in this number on eBay, you'll find the right white clip.\nThe other number, which didn't fit for my Macbook Pro is 221159039824\nI hope this solves anyone's question in the future, as it was really a pain to find the right result.\n\nA: Apparently these are called scissor clips and there are various types, identified as type A, B, C etc.\nIt's important you identify the type you need. To do this, use this handy reference \nFull Product Page of Scissor Clips\nI have a Unibody MacBook Pro early 2011, which is actually the first item on that page. What isn't immediately obvious is that if you click on the image, a new window opens up showing you images of the various scissor clips for the keyboards of the designated Mac products.\n\nYou can then double-check the type against the one you're replacing. So in my case, I can now confidently go ahead and order a bunch of type G standard clips.\nI had expected there to be a link from that page to the product listing, but if there is, I can't see it. So instead, go to this page and choose your clips according to the type number you've now identified: SEE BELOW\n\nA: Giving any link or code to a specific product is misleading since the 2009 MacBook Pros, like almost all Apple laptops, could use one of two different clip types. Apple sources it's keyboards from two companies, Darfon and Sunrex, and although they look identical, underneath the key caps they have their own different clip/mechanism designs and these are not interchangeable. The only way to be sure you are getting the right clip or key cap is to visually identify the clip type of your existing keyboard. That is why thebookyard.com show the photos of the different clip types.\nThere is no industry standard name for the different clips so companies like thebookyard define their own names for each variant. On Apple's service spare parts list they refer to them as type D or S (referring to Darfon or Sunrex) but this is not that helpful since these two companies also redesign their own clips over time, so a Darfon clip for a 2009 MacBook Pro will be different from a Darfon clip on a 2012 MacBook Pro. To uniquely identify the clip design, thebookyard designate a new letter to every new clip variant that Apple uses.\nAnyone who is claiming to sell a clip for a 2009 MacBook Pro without allowing you to identify which of the two types it is, is just taking a gamble. Although it is true that within certain geographical areas, one keyboard make is sometimes much more prevalent but it's still a gamble.\nBefore buying any clip or key cap for your Apple laptop, make sure you visually compare a clip from your existing keyboard to the clip you are buying. Note that each keyboard uses 4-6 different clips for different shape keys (arrow, shift, space, a-z etc) so you need to compare like for like, not necessary exactly the same key but the same type of key i.e. All alphabet, number and punctuation keys use the same standard clip.\nI hope this helps explain what is a deceptively complex subject. \n\nA: I would say double check your clip. I have a key on a Macbook Air that does not match E or G. I think Type-K is what I have purchased to fix the loose key. \n", "Q: iOS App Advertisement choice : iAd or AdMob ? what will you choose , iAd or AdMob ? and what is the reason behind ?\nI'm now using iAd, as I think Apple may block AdMob anytime, as Apple wants to protect its iAd.

Or I just can't handle this program. \n\n\n*\n\n*First I clicked on \"workflow\" (is that right or should I have chosen another icon?)\n\n*define the automation: \"Get Folder Contents\" --> \"Sort Finder Items\" (Type) --> \"Sort Finder Items\" (name) --> \"Repeat for each subfolder found\", \n\n\nThat's how it looks: (sry for the german, but the description is in (2))\n\n--> Or is it possible to do it apart from automator?\n\nA: Perhaps the trick is to identify where the system gets its default settings for creating a .DS_Store file and modify those settings. This would, in theory, make the Finder perform the way you would like as it's default.\nOther methods seem to have significant pitfalls and unfortunately force the view to icon using the browser window in the finder. I personally want to conserve screen real-estate and use more than one window in the finder... thus taking that whole browser window and reducing it to icon view without the superfluous adornments is my ideal state.  Then being able to flip to list, with a command key and back, perfect.\nAs it is, it is a long standing FTFF issue in Mac OS X.  Apple is trying to make the Mac more like an iPad which is no smarter than Microsoft trying to make a tablet more like a desktop.\nSo... where does the Finder get the settings to create the .DS-Store file. If it is a structured approach, the settings are hidden in some plist buried deep in a package or elsewhere.  If it is unstructured, it is stored in the binary code of the Finder... (hoping for former)\n\nA: As bmike mentioned, the default settings are not used for folders that have folder-specific settings saved in a .DS_Store file. You can just delete .DS_Store files though:\nsudo find / -name .DS_Store -delete; killall Finder\n\n\nA: The system design isn't easily amenable to this task.\nYou can change the default view so that all folders that do not have a customized .DS_Store file to over-ride the default all take your desired default folder view.\nYou can change each folder's .DS_Store file to have them all use common settings, but since there isn't an API for making atomic changes to a .DS_Store file and it's a binary file format, you'll need some serious low level skills to tweak this. Have you tried just setting up a shell (or better python or perl) script to put a desired .DS_Store file recursively in all the sub folders (and handling aliases and sym-linked folders as you wish) from the target folder?\n", "Q: Macbook Air power saving with Thunderbolt to Gigabit adapter I am considering buying a Thunderbolt to Gigabit adapter to save my MBA power consumption as I can shutdown the Wifi, assume it use a lot of power.\nAnyone tried before and it works? How many % of power can be saved? e.g. increase the battery life by how many %?\n\nA: I have no precise data; however, I do have a MacBook Air mid 2012 and I had to buy a Thunderbolt Gigabit adapter. What I can say is that it consumer substantially more than the WiFi chip. Fully charged, I can reach 5+ hours using the WiFi chip; when the Thunderbolt Gigabit adapter, it's enough if I get to 3.5 hours.\nHonestly, this was an authentic shock to me, and I blamed the battery at first, thinking it was faulty and needed to be changed; however, using the WiFi, battery life gets back to 5+ hours, so I'm pretty sure this has to do with the Thunderbolt Gigabit adapter.\nThis is not a scientific test, but on average I use the Mac to surf on the internet, normal stuff. Anyway, I got this decrease in performance without changing my usage pattern.\n\nA: I am using on a daily basis a MBA2013 Haswell, and I can confirm that the thunderbolt ethernet consumes much more power than the WiFi link.\nI can get up to 12 hours on wifi, never had more than 7 on ethernet.\n\nA: My guess is you will see little to no power savings by shifting the network from the wireless interface to a thunderbolt interface. In fact, the power consumption of running thunderbolt and the chipset in the adapter might be higher than the wifi chipset, so this may be an interesting test should someone perform it.\nYou will find that disabling the network is what yields the primary power savings on 2012 and older MacBook Air (and Pro) since the network delivers interrupts that prevent the CPU from sleeping and let the machine do more work.\nIf you change your habits and reduce CPU load, screen brightness and disable network access to let an Air work locally, you will extend your battery life from 2x to 4x in my experience on the 2012 and older Air.\nThe 2013 Air are not out for long, so it's a guess if the effects there will be more or less. My guess is that network access will reduce life there even more (since they are designed to be even lower power at idle than the previous generation), but it remains to be seen in practice.\n\nA: I'm on a 15' rMBP 2014 and whenever I use the adapter (thunderbolt to ethernet) I notice a double rate of battery's charge decrease. If I use wi-fi, I leave the office with 50% charge whereas with the adapter I leave with 15% or less. Of course I always start with 100% charge and performing pretty much the same tasks every day.\n\nA: Exactly the same experience here.  Significantly less time running from the Thunderbolt to Gigabyte Ethernet adapter.\n", "Q: AppleScript to close \"About this Mac\" window How could I use AppleScript code to close the window named \"About this Mac\" (A propos de ce Mac in French). I need an AppleScript for this because I use Dragon Dictate 3 commands. I am handicapped and I don't manage to use any keyboard or mouse. Only Voice and edited commands.\nI tried Command+W shortcut but it didn't work for this window. It works for all other Finder windows except this one.\n\nA: The window is shown by the loginwindow process, and you can close it by clicking the close button:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"loginwindow\"\n    click button 1 of window 1 -- or window \"About This Mac\"\nend tell\n\nclose window 1 didn't work.\n", "Q: How to use Mac OS X \"Per-user screen sharing\" from a Windows PC? I am trying to use the \"Per-user screen sharing\" feature in Mac OS X Lion.  This is different from regular screen sharing in that it allows you to log in to your account on the Mac remotely without disturbing a different user who is already logged on.  What what I can tell from experimentation, to use per-user screen sharing you must disable the 'VNC viewers may control screen with password' option.\nI am trying to connect from a PC. Problem is, I can't get it to work.  TightVNC complains, Server did not offer supported security type.  UltraVNC says No supported authentication methods! and RealVNC has the nerve to tell me to turn on the \"control screenwith password option\" which would disable the very feature I need, per-user screen sharing!!!  (To connect to Apple Remote Desktop (10.4) or Screen Sharing/Remote Management (10.5 onwards) built-in to Mac OS X, turn on the 'VNC viewers may control screen with password' option.)\nI have trouble believing that it is impossible to connect to per-user sharing just because I am not connecting from a Mac.  At the moment the only work-around is to connect to a different Mac using single screen sharing and then VNC to the other Mac.  Quite frankly, that is ridiculous.\n\nA: The trick to doing this appears to be the following: under Computer Settings you need to enable VNC viewers may control screen with password but NOT enable Anyone may request permission to control screen.  You then enter a control password which grants access to the login screen, and use your own local username and password to log in.\n", "Q: Backing up Time Machine sparsebundles to another server So, a while ago I backed up a couple of different Macs to my Linux-based fileserver. As a network Time Machine, each Mac has a separate sparsebundle file containing all of its information. I've since changed Macs and formatted various drives since then, so the original installations for the backups are no longer available.\nI want to back up these sparsebundles to a ReadyNAS, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about it. There's rsync on the main server, but I've heard that rsync can cause all sorts of permissions issues and it doesn't play nicely with hard links.\nAnother option is using one of the Macs to transfer the sparsebundle files to the server via AFP (either with the Finder or with an application like SuperDuper or Chronosync). How efficient would this be? Does AFP behave like some other sharing protocols and copy the data via the mediator (in this case, Fileserver -> Mac -> ReadyNAS), or does it copy directly from source to final target? What would be the best tool for this?\nIf all else fails, I read somewhere else that a last ditch attempt would be to simply grab the contents of the Latest folder out of each sparsebundle, but I'd rather avoid this if at all possible.\n\nA: I would say, rsync away once you are sure the sparsebundles are not being actively mounted or written to by other Mac OS clients.\nThe beauty of an Apple disk image is that all the Mac unique things are stored internally since they are a filesystem unto themselves and don't rely on your actual storage filesystem in any way. As long as you get the file names over and the OS has permissions to re-share the files - you can't break things as you move the actual files that make up the sparse bundle directory scheme to another Linux or OS X or Windows OS.\nIn a nutshell, the files stored as bands in the sparse bundle format are very portable which makes the HFS internals immune to corruption when the raw data is copied faithfully to a new location or a new server with a different filesystem structure. \nIn fact, having a Mac mount the filesystem encapsulated within the sparsebundle container would be a less optimal solution since it could take far longer to traverse the hard linked directory structure rather than let linux copy the file data efficiently. You would lose all the benefits of a sparse storage scheme to have OS X mount the files and copy them directly.\n", "Q: How do cope with a space when setting the $PATH I want to add the sublime lib to my path but it has a space in it. \nI have tried the obvious like you would navigate in the terminal (\ne.g. /Applications/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2.app/Contents)\nexport PATH=\"/Applications/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl:$PATH\"\n\nBut I still get the error \n/Applications/Sublime: No such file or directory\n\nI could rename it but I am curious how to resolve it. I am using bash.\n\nA: If the path is set properly at .bash_profile, whether with double quotes or backslash-escaped and has spaces in it, you need to call the variables with double quotes.\nFor example, if .bash_profile is set like below:\nexport SUBLIMEPATH=\"/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents\"\nexport PATH=$PATH:$SUBLIMEPATH/SharedSupport/bin/subl\n\nYou can't do cd $SUBLIMEPATH to change the current directory, you'll get No such file or directory error. But with double quotes such as cd \"$SUBLIMEPATH\" you can.\nHope this help for something.\n\nA: To resolve it I made a simlink in \nln -s \"/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl\" /usr/local/sublime/bin/subl\n\nI then added it to my path by using vi on ~./bashrc\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/sublime/bin/:$PATH\"\n\nRemember to source the .bashrc to pick up your changes\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: Use backslash or quotes, not both. You put the sequence backslash-space in the PATH value.\nexport PATH=\"/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl:$PATH\"\n\nor\nexport PATH=/Applications/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl:$PATH\n\nBe sure not to wrap the line: it has to be spaces, not newlines.\nNote that if you see an error like /Applications/Sublime: No such file or directory from the export PATH=… line, then you have a syntax error in that line, such as a space after the equal sign: the assignment doesn't try to look up the directory. If the error is at some later time, then it isn't due to the PATH value, or if so only very indirectly: it's perfectly ok for entries in $PATH not to exist, and a non-existent directory will not lead to an error message.\n\nA: This doesn't answer the question. However, it addresses as remark made in one of the answers, and discusses a similar procedure.\nIt is also possible to create an alias for Sublime Text by editing .bash_profile or .bashrc (whichever is the BASH configuration file in your home directory).\nalias sublime=\"/Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/MacOS/Sublime\\ Text\"\n\nIn order to do so, it is necessary to use BOTH escape back slashes and quotes. Note in particular that this is a very different situation from exporting the PATH as mentioned above, because there it only makes sense to do one or the other, but not both.\nNote also that it isn't necessary to create a symlink first, as the official Sublime documentation and many other sources claim. This answer on StackOverflow gets it right.\n", "Q: How do I stop Alfred from stealing command+shift+\\? I use the program Alfred2, unfortunately it keeps trying to steal the keyboard shortcut CMD+SHIFT+\\. How do I stop it from doing so? It conflicts with other apps such as Aperture. \n\nA: Apparently, one of the workflow hijacked the shortcut. Has nothing to do with Alfred itself.\n\nA: I don’t think Alfred uses that shortcut by default; that’s being used by 1Password for me. Do you mean CMD+SHIFT+/ (which takes you to the previous path used in the file browser?).\nAll the keyboard shortcuts that Alfred uses can be customised in the preferences. To get to the preferences, open Alfred, and press CMD+,.\nIf my guess is correct, then you want to select Features > File Search > Navigation and change the shortcut associated with the Previous Path. Click on the box to the right of that label, and either press a new keyboard shortcut you want to use, or press delete to just unassign CMD+SHIFT+/.\nThese instructions work in Alfred 2; I don’t have a copy of Alfred 1 to hand so I can’t remember how it works in that version. (And this assumes my guess is right, of course.)\n", "Q: What happens if the Internet connection goes down during a Lion Internet Recovery? I am restoring Lion on my MacBook before selling it and I am doing it through the Internet Recovery option. After starting the process, the Internet connection went down a couple of times and, after this happening, the blue progress bar jumped to the end, so I don't know the exact percentage.\nDo you know what happens in this case? Does the download resume from where it left or does it start from the beginning?\n\nA: For a short interruption, you can expect the download to resume. I might choose to power it off and start over since you might end up with a corrupt package that the OS will not install and a cryptic error message. Worse, the install may stall and you could wait a long time before giving up.\nIt's in your interest to get the installation over a fast internet connection (perhaps a local Apple Store) so that you don't have to do it over or wait so long in the end.\n", "Q: Transfering Lion preinstalled license to new owner My MacBook came with Lion preinstalled, now I am selling the machine and I've read that it is possible to transfer the OS license once if the OS came preinstalled on the computer. Is there something specific that I need to do or will the license transfer complete when the new user logs in with their Apple ID?\n\nA: Nothing needs to be done since the Mac's serial number is used to re-download Lion so no Apple ID is tied to that installation package for the OS.\nThis differs from purchasing a Lion upgrade from the App Store - that isn't intended to be sold, so you'd have to adjust the sale price or gift them a card if the deal was for them to get other software included with the sale.\nI've seen people trip up over iLife since it does get tied to an Apple ID rather than tied to the CPU when selling a used Mac, so caveat venditor and caveat emptor is in order.\n", "Q: What did I do wrong - Safari 6.0.5 on 10.8.4 ... has recently taken a turn for the worse. Constant beach-balls, and after an hour's browsing, that damned Safari Web Content is running between 2 and 3GB, between real and virtual. If I leave tabs sit, Safari says it must force reload all pages. \nA little memory-freer app helps release some \"Inactive Memory,\" run frequently, but doesn't seem like a real answer.\nHave 8 GB RAM in a 2.8GHz MBPro, and lately big page-out numbers. Did the RAM needed to run all this get ahead of me ... or is this all really Safari? Or Flash, which runs at high memory, but not so high as that \"Web Content\" - which is what? Another name for Flash?\nOn broadband, we used to say, Disable caches. Maybe not a good idea anymore. Or turning off pre-fetching?\nRestarting Safari returns things to normal, for a while. I run a few extensions, not many. Keep machine in good maintenance. Do not have a problem with keeping many apps open. I just wanna surf! \n\nA: Memory leaks are typical of all browsers when visiting lots of pages, not just Safari. This problem is solved by the new memory management system in OS X Mavericks (10.9).\nHaving lots of inactive memory isn't an issue until paging starts, that's when systems start to not respond. The easiest solution to this is to disable the paging system all together, which isn't an issue on systems with sufficient RAM (4GB+). Here's how:\nTurn off the paging system (requires restart):\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\nRenable the paging system (requires restart):\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\n\nA: For what it is worth, I generally recommend to people who don't want to update their OS that they use chrome. Apple only updates safari when they update the entire os, so you are better off with a third party solution for a browser.\n(Mavericks came out after this question was posted, so this answer is only effective for people looking for an answer to the question now that it has been released.)\n", "Q: Who was the original iOS designer? I read somewhere that the new iOS7 design is an old project of the current designer, and that it was adopted now because the original iOS designer left the company.\nUpdate:\nThis is the post I'm referring to.\nWhat 5 Dots In iOS 7 Reveal About A Decade Of Apple Design Strife\n\nA: \nScott Forstall is an American software engineer who was the senior vice president (SVP) of iOS Software at Apple Inc. from 2007 until October 2012.\nSir Jonathan Paul \"Jony\" Ive, KBE RDI (born 27 February 1967)1 is an English designer and the Senior Vice President of Design at Apple Inc.

I have a presentation in Keynote that has some audio files interleaved with the slides. In composition mode, the audio icon is viewable, no doubt to allow me to click on the item and be able to manipulate it as necessary, but in presentation mode, it disappears.\nIs there a built in way to display some sort of icon where the audio file is, and illuminate it whenever the particular sample is playing? There are sometimes multiple files per slide.\nI know that I can always put an icon of my own on top of it, and change it when the sample is playing, and change it back automatically whenever it's completed with transitions, but I can't figure out if there's a built in way to handle this already.\n\nA: Here are 2 possible solutions:\nMake the placed audio icon larger then std (53x53 pixel), then move your mouse into that larger region while in presentation playback mode. (The controller is not visible while editing your presentation.)\nAs with the standard-sized icon, though, this icon will not appear in presentation mode. \nTo access the audio playback controls while in presentation mode, just move your mouse into the region of the large icon (up to 400 pixel), and the controller will appear.\nNOTE: it will require mouse controls during presentation so I prefer the second solution.\nSecond solution:\nThere is a possible way, and I think it is the ultimate way to do it:\nI would create a video template with something like spinning wheel.\nThen I would add your music to the video, and repeat that as many times as you like saving the video each time.\nNow you will be inserting video files that are actually meant only to play sounds while showing a little inconspicuous rotating wheel for your information when that file is running.\nI would recommend to leave the first and the last video frames empty so the do not show when sound is not playing\nSince it is really not a video you are watching you can size it to what ever size you want.\n\nA: Another option is to convert the audio file to video with a waveform (for some reason, video files show a control but audio files don't).\nInstall ffmpeg and run this in the command line:\nffmpeg -y -i \"/choose/your/folder/input.mp3\" -filter_complex \\\n\"[0:a]showwaves=s=150x100:scale=lin:mode=cline:colors=white:rate=25,format=yuv420p[v]\" \\\n-map \"[v]\" -map 0:a \"/choose/your/folder/output.mp4\"\n\nNote: You can change 150x100 to 1500x1000 for example, if you want a higher resolution.\nIt will end up looking like this:\n\nYou'll be able to toggle pause/play once the video has started playing. \nIf you have more than one video, you won't be able to click-start at random.

To install Riak on OSX, Basho recommends to change the files limit on the system: Open File Limit.   \nBut before doing that, I want to know the impact of changing that on the system. Should I expect slowing the system? More RAM usage?\n\nA: There is no impact. You're simply changing the max number of open file descriptors a process can have. Without it, any software that needs to have more than 256 open file descriptors simply can not be used.\nAlmost any software that acts as a server is going to require this; a file descriptor is also required for sockets. \nSee: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/36841/why-is-number-of-open-files-limited-in-linux for more info on why the default is so low. \nOSX went even further using 256 as the default.

But I don't like this option, there should be some way to manually delete a failing certificate.\n\nA: I always get this problem when using Remote Desktop.  Even though race_carr's answer to reset the keychain will likely work, I think the process is too destructive.  What I just did was go into keychain and clean up the login->certificates section by removing duplicate, untrusted, and old certificates.  That fixed the freezing problem.\n\nA: I would recommend resetting to a new/default keychain and see if that resolves the issue. Keep in mind that any stored passwords, keys, secure notes, or certificates will be deleted when you do this.\nIn Keychain Access.app under Preferences choose \"Reset My Default Keychain\" and then restart (for good measure).

How can I check this?\n\nA: You could use an app such as iPhone / iPod Touch Backup Extractor (for Mac) and iPhone Backup Extractor (for Windows) to check the backup to make sure that the files that you require have been successfully backed up.\nIf necessary, you could attempt to restore the files to be certain that you have access to them.\n", "Q: Airport Express and AirPlay I'd like to set up an AirPort express connected to a HiFi as an airplay receiver, acting as a device on a wireless network.\nAt some point in the future, I'd like to extend my wired network to the location of the airport, place the airport on the wired network, continue to use the airport as an airplay device but also use it as an access point for the wireless network.\nWill both of these situations work as described?\n\nA: sure, this will work. when you extend your wired network, change your airport express to either extend your existing wireless network or setup it up as an access point.\n", "Q: Where can I find system log information on OS X Lion 10.7.5 for System Preferences changes?

It will take around 6 - 8 seconds for the Dock to 'die' and then be restarted. If your password is not working then you are not an 'Administrator' on the computer in which case you will need to obtain that password from the Administrator.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and removing .plist didn't fix anything.\nAfter that I realized that de cmd+alt+esc shortcut didn't work either.\nSo I checked with the character viewer, and it appeared that my keyboard had 3 unfunctional keys (shift tab esc).\nSo...it might be worth checking that first...\n", "Q: How to get the chrome tabs to always show when in full screen mode? I would really like to use Chrome on my new 2013 Macbook Air with tabs, but without the menu bar.  So, I use full-screen mode, but it hides the tabs.  Is what I want possible?  And, if so, how can I get it to work that way?\n\nA: Shift-CMD-F is for presentation mode and will hide the tabs.  You want full screen mode instead, so use Control-CMD-F.  Tabs will show in full screen mode.\n\nA: It sounds like you’re trying to enter Full Screen Mode with Command+Shift+F. Like what others have mentioned, you have to use Shift+Command+F to enter Full Screen Mode (with tabs available) instead of Presentation Mode where tabs are hidden.\nBut if you want to use Command+Shift+F for Full Screen mode, open Keyboard Preferences and change Presentation Mode shortcut to other key combination, eg. Option+Shift+F. Here is the screenshot for the explanation above. (Ignore the All Applications configurations; just take a look at Google Chrome shortcuts assignments)\n\n\nA: chrome://flags, look for \"Enables simplified fullscreen\", make sure you set it to disabled.\n\nA: With latest version of Chrome, there is the option to show the Toolbar (which includes tabs) in the View menu.\n\n\nA: This is an issue with the viewing mode.

I used to enable TRIM using 3rd party software, and I had to do it all the time Apple released a minor upgrade. Recently I installed OS X 10.8.3 on a SSD and when I was ready to install the SSD in a new MBP, 10.8.4 came out. I installed the SSD in the laptop and upgraded to 10.8.4.  To my surprise TRIM was enabled. \nAnybody else with the same experience? My SSD is a 512 GB Samsung.\n\nA: I can confirm that in my case installing OSX 10.8.4 on a new SSD I had to enable TRIM with TRIM Enabler.\nWhen I first ran TRIM enabler the application displayed that TRIM was not enabled.\nHow did you determine that TRIM was enabled?\n", "Q: Console reporting \"Deprecated\" in 10.8.x Not that i know what it is but would like to fix it anyway!\nMy Console shows this...but to my knowledge my MBA 10.8.4 is working fine ?\n\n6/23/13 11:35:31.952 AM System Preferences[3575]: \n* WARNING: -[NSImage compositeToPoint:fromRect:operation:] is deprecated in MacOSX 10.8 and later. \nPlease use -[NSImage drawAtPoint:fromRect:operation:fraction:]\n  instead.\n\nHonestly, I had to Google the word deprecated first to know what it means.\n\nDeprecation is a status applied to a computer software feature,\n  characteristic, or practice indicating it should be avoided, typically\n  because of being superseded.\n\nOK, so how do I fix that problem.\n\nA: It is not a problem for you. The code is working correctly.\n\"Deprecate\" is what is used in development to tell the developer who uses a library that the next version of a library will not include the method that they are using. This allows the library writers to remove code and let developers using the code prepare to change how they called the library in the next version.\n", "Q: iPhone contact search (with letters) doesn't return anything Suddenly my contact searching stopped working.

Unfortunately, it doesn't help me.\nNote: My phone is iPhone 4s and iOS 6.1.3.\nDo you have any solution or advise fot that?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: It seems that you have multiple contact accounts on your iPhone.

Say your download of 17gb application is interrupted and can't continue since you are out of space.\nKnowing the application name, where can you look to find parts of what has already been downloaded so you can remove it?\n\nA: Here's another way to find the Mac App Store downloads folder by enabling the debug menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit the App Store\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Run command: defaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true\n\n*Open the App Store\n\n*Select the new \"Debug\" menu in the menu bar and choose \"Show Download Folder...\"\n\n\nDemo: https://gfycat.com/KindLimpBarracuda\n\nA: As of macOS 11.4, those can be found here:\n/private/var/folders/[folder1]/[folder2]/C/com.apple.appstoreagent/com.apple.appstore/\n\nwhere:\n[folder1] and [folder2] are temporary folders\nFor example:\n/private/var/folders/xk/s3v4txqs7v3b6rvsd6f9yjhw0000gn/C/com.apple.appstoreagent/com.apple.appstore\n\nYou can look for such folders with this command:\nsudo find /private/var/folders -path '*com\\.apple\\.appstoreagent*' -type d -name com.apple.appstore 2>/dev/null\n\n\nA: The temporary location that stores downloading files varies between computers. Here's how to find it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start a rather large app store download\n\n*Open Activity monitor, and select the storedownloadd process. (storeagent for 10.9 and below)\n\n*Open the Inspector (press the \"i\" button, or ⌘+i)\n\n*Select the Open Files and Ports tab, and scroll to the bottom\n\n*Select the path that starts with /private/var/folders that contains com.apple.appstore from the beginning, up to and including com.apple.appstore \n\n*Open Terminal and type open [paste path here] and hit return\n\n*From here, you can see all the temporary files the Mac App Store has made. You can get info on each one to see their sizes, and dispose of them accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nA: Downloads, finished or not, will be in your Downloads folder in your User Directory. Unless you have specified that Safari save them somewhere else: bad idea. Ceetainly not to the desktop, as so many people think.\nIn the General pane of Safari preferences, you will find the setting for what folder to save to ... and in answer to your other question, you can choose whether Safari is to remove incomplete downloads: manually, never, or when successfully downloaded. \nThe option to Open \"safe\" files after downloading is way unnecessary, uncheck that only if you're experienced with security measures.\nBUT, I think you're confused about downloading vs. installing. Two separate processes. Downloaded filed or zips or disk images can sit there forever. If you're asking how to fully uninstall an installed application, please ask a new question.\n\nA: There is a very simple method to find downloaded .dmg files, when you wish to clean up or reuse or archive some .dmg file. This applies not only to App Store downloaded .dmg's but also to many other software downloaded using a .dmg file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Finder menu \"Go -> Go to Folder...\" and enter /private/var\n\n*Once the window of this normally hidden folder is open use the search box, by default in the top right corner of the window, and enter there '.dmg' (without the quotes)\n\n*You get a list of all .dmg files that are currently in that temporary directory. If your Finder view preferences show the Path Bar, you see on the bottom of the window in the path bar for every selected .dmg file immediately the folder where the wanted .dmg resides. To activate the path bar choose Finder menu \"View -> Show Path Bar\".\n\n\nAbove method is straightforward and requires nothing else than ordinary Finder functionality.\nBTW, the involved folders store these files only temporary. If your only motivation is to get rid of a large downloaded file, then a restart suffices to clean out these files.\n\nA: Run in Terminal to open the folder in Finder:\nopen /private/var/folders/*/*/C/com.apple.appstore\n\n", "Q: Is there room for two drives in the 27\" 2012 iMac? I've looked around a bit, but can't find anybody saying whether there is room in the new slim iMac for an extra internal SSD. I used this tutorial about a year ago to add an additional SSD to my Mid 2010 iMac and would like to do it with my new one. Since the iMac ships with Fusion Drive as an option, might there be a second bay and connector (or at least space for them) inside the chassis?\nIs there any documentation showing whether the 2012 iMacs have room for multiple drives?\n\nA: It can be done, but I’m not sure which SKUs it applies to, or that it’s particularly advisable.\nBoth the 2.9 GHz and the 3.1 GHz 21.5″ iMacs have space for a second drive bay, and there’s an iFixit tutorial explaining how to install a second drive. (iFixit usually tear down new hardware within a day or so of release, and have a lot of tutorials for things like hardware upgrades and repairs).\nCurrently their page for the 27″ model doesn’t have such a tutorial. However, there’s a page on their forums where people are discussing associated teardowns and the possibility of such an upgrade. The poster ifixit611 writes:\n\nThe 27″ iMac holds one 3.5″ drive (unlike the 21″, which uses a 2.5″ drive), and one “blade” SSD like the new MacBook Pros use. Unlike the new 21″ iMac, you can upgrade the RAM on the 27″ w/o cutting the machine open (there’s an access hatch on the back).\nReplacing the disk requires cutting open the display and removing the left speaker. You’ll need a proper mounting bracket (e.g., an Icy Dock) to mount a 2.5″ SSD in place of the 3.5″ drive. Adding/replacing the blade SSD requires pulling out the main logic board.\n\nThey conclude that they won’t be performing the upgrade before iFixit or OWC provide a proper “kit”.\nSo it sounds like, in theory, you could perform this upgrade on a 27″ iMac, and the instructions from iFixit for upgrading the 21″ would probably be helpful in this regard. That said, hardware is not my area of expertise and I generally get twitchy about opening up iMacs. Do at your own risk, etc.\n\nA: There is no place for a second common SDD in the late 2012 iMacs since they have no optical drive. \nThe SSD apple uses in the Fusion Drive has another form factor as you can see it in iFixit 's guide. So if you want a second SSD you'll need these kind of SSD. \n", "Q: When I update my app, does it need to be re-approved? If I have an app on the app store and I want to update it, does it need to go through the approval process again every time I update it?\n\nA: Yes it does, but the review times are much faster. I just submitted an update and it was reviewed and live within 5 days (counting the weekend).\n", "Q: Right-click, create a new text file. How? In Finder > Select a folder > Right click, we get a popup with an option to create a new folder:\n\nIs there a way to add menu item New Textfile for adding a new text file?\n\nA: Edit: I couldn't get the above working as a Service but then I found a dialog hiding behind everything else where Finder was asking for permission to use the accessibility features. Once I'd enabled that the answer from Lauri Ranta worked. But the one below works well and doesn't need extra permissions.\nI've tried several ways, the cleanest I've found is the Automator script provided here:\nhttp://oscargodson.com/posts/new-file-in-right-click-context-menu-for-mac.html\nAnd available from Github here:\nhttps://github.com/OscarGodson/New-File\n\nA: There is a little known feature of the Finder called Stationary Pad.  Imagine having a pad of paper that you could \"tear off\" a new sheet from on your desktop.  Each page in the pad could have a custom layout and pre-existing content etc, allow you to (for example) fill in a \"while you were out, X called\" memo.\nI'm not as a Mac at present to get screenshots etc, but if you open up a text document, and then enter the details you want to be used as your template (bearing in mind a totally blank sheet is a perfectly valid template), then save it somewhere, right click and Get Info, then click the Stationary Pad tick box, then that file will subsequently behave differently from a normal file.  Double clicking to open the file will actually open a copy of the file, without any filename set, as if it were a totally new document, allowing you to fill it in and save it with a name/location of your choosing.  The great thing about this is that without unticking the stationary pad option, you cannot accidentally overwrite or otherwise modify the original template.\nThere is more info if you google, this is a brief summary with helpful commens that isn't too old.\nThis isn't quite right clicking on the desktop and clicking \"New File\", but if your template icon is on the desktop it's arguably faster (depending on if you are faster at locating an icon and double clicking, or using any white space, right clicking then choosing from a context sensitive menu...)\nAlternatively, you could use a combination of one of the scripted methods shown in other answers to get them to simply open a Stationary pad file, and you can recreate the \"create blank\" feature nicely from any App, even ones that don't support Applescript, and the \"blank\" document doesn't even have to be blank,  but can be a template.\n\nA: New File Applescript with Toolbar Icon\nFound this open source gem. Can either use the .App or add the Applescript manually. Will add a New File widget to the Finder toolbar.\n\n\nA: If you use Alfred, you can try this workflow. http://www.packal.org/workflow/create-new-file-finder-file-type-templates\nThen you can type \"new\" in Alfred to create a new file in the current folder.\n\nA: New File Menu.app can be configured to provide an experience familiar to Windows users if that's what you're after.\n\nTo achieve this, purchase New File Menu.app for $1.99 from the Apple App Store\nConfigure the General settings as seen in the image below:\n\nUnder Templates, rename the Text File Title to Text Document and the Prefix NewFile to New Text Document. Uncheck all other enabled templates.\n\n\nA: I am using XtraFinder plugin for Mac OS's built in Finder. It has most of the features including create new file in finder options.\nYou'll love it like I do\n;)\n\nA: If you download and install BetterTouchTool you can set up this action easily; it's one of the built-in available triggers.\nBetter yet, you can set it up for any keyboard shortcut or trackpad gesture you like.  (Including a lot of trackpad gestures you didn't know existed.)\n(I'm not affiliated with BTT in any way, but I do feel that a lot more Mac users should be using it.  It is the first application I install on any new Mac and I've been using it for over five years.)\n\nA: You could assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Finder\"\n    value of attribute \"AXFocusedWindow\" is scroll area 1\nend tell\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if result is true or number of windows is 0 then\n        set t to desktop\n    else\n        set t to target of Finder window 1\n    end if\n    set f to make new file at t\n    if t is desktop then\n        set selection to f\n    else\n        select f\n    end if\nend tell\n\nThere is a bug in 10.7 and 10.8 that affects many other scripts and Automator services like this. Finder ignores new windows when getting the insertion location and selection properties. If you open a new Finder window, select some items in it, and run tell app \"Finder\" to selection in AppleScript Editor, the result is the items selected in some window behind the frontmost window (or an empty list). One workaround is to move focus to another application and back, but it results in a visual glitch.\nSo neither of these ways of checking if the desktop is selected work reliably:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    insertion location as alias is desktop as alias\n    container of item 1 of (get selection) as alias is desktop as alias\nend tell\n\nYou could also wrap the script as an Automator service, but there is another bug where the shortcuts for Automator services don't always work until you hover over the services menu from the menu bar. If the input type was set to no input, the service wouldn't show up in context menus. If it was set to folders or files, you'd have to always secondary-click some folder or file.\nRelated questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create new file from contextual menu\n\n*New File Action in Finder\n\n*How to create a text file in a folder\n\n*How do I create files in Finder without Terminal?\nI didn't vote to close this question, because many of the solutions in the other questions are affected by either of the two bugs mentioned above. We'll likely get even more questions like this, which could then be closed as duplicates of this question.\n\nA: There is a new APP in the store:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/new-file-menu/id1064959555?ls=1&mt=12\n\nNew File Menu allows you to create new files quickly via the Finder context menu. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you upgraded to macOS Sierra, you may need to reinstall New File Menu.New File Menu is simply the coolest way to create a new file on the Mac OS X platform, you can right click in any Finder window to create a new file! You can even right click on the desktop to create your files!\n\n\nImportant: New File Menu is implemented as a Finder extension, you need to enable \"New File Menu Extension\" in \"System Preferences » Extensions\" to make the context menu appear.\n\nA: You can try New File Menu Free (the free version of New File Menu, mentioned in other answers), it's free and working fine, although it only supports one extension at a time:\n\n\nA: High Sierra: Go to System Prefs/Keyboard/Shortcuts, choose SERVICES and check \"Open Selection in a TextEdit window\". It will show up in your Services menu now. You can add a hotkey there too. \n\nA: This also works pretty well if you're willing to spend a bit of money:\nhttps://langui.net/new-file-menu/\n", "Q: Dashcode (3.0.5) crashes in Mountain Lion (10.8.4) I'm trying to get Dashcode to run in order to make a dashboard widget to surprise my friend.

When the screensaver has been disturbed, or the computer wakes from sleep, my system asks for a password.  I would like to add to this dialog. Along with username and password, there would be a third field asking for user text input on what they would like to do at the computer. After a successful login, the Automator would take the user input and put it in a stickie note in the corner of the desktop.\nThis is for productivity purposes, as I always get distracted whenever I go to the computer and after a long time surfing the internet, I forget what I actually logged on for. \nI have seen a lot of questions & answers on adding your own text message to the login window, but not any on adding a user input text field.  I have a vague idea of how this might work (which could be totally wrong), but here is what I think:\n\n\n*\n\n*I need to edit the com.apple.loginwindow.plist and add a custom field that asks for user input? (is this possible?)\n\n*Use Automator to paste the user input into a Stickie.\n\n*Somehow run a shell script to have the Automator perform this action after every login. (or do I even need this b/c I can do that in the Automator?) \nAlso not sure: so I need to use AppleScript? \nThanks for any help.  I am on Snow Leopard by the way. \n\nA: Probably not.\nI would imagine that the lock screen is locked down fairly tight - imagine a piece of malware that did just that - except the Automator action sent the password to a server in Bangladesh.\n", "Q: How can I make applications on OSX open new windows in the same space when opening a file from Finder? OSX 10.8. Pretty simple. Right now when I open a file through Finder, if the filetype is set to be open by application Y, oftentimes OSX finds a space that has an open window of Y, and sends the file into that window in that space. What I want though is, when I open the file, I want a new window for that file, and in the same space.\nPer this question, I know that there is a workaround explicitly for Chrome, which is great; ditto this for Finder. But I want this setting to be system-wide. E.g. I want to open a new txt document through finder and have MacVim open a new window with the file in my current space (as it would if it were launching for the first time) rather than locating an open window in a separate space and pulling the file into a tab in that window. \nNote, I do have my settings set so that switching to an application does not switch to a space with an open window for that application, which works correctly, but when the application launch takes place through a file opening rather than via the cmd-tab switcher, it still does the find-an-open-window-even-if-in-another-space thing.\nNote again, there are two issues here--\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't like that it switches spaces\n\n*I don't like that it opens the file in an existing window rather than in a new window\n\n\n--and I don't see how you can solve one without solving the other; but it'd be great if either or both could be solved.\n\nA: Does setting the assign to Desktop:none; work for you.\nYou can do this from the Applications Dock menu.\n\n\nA: To open a new window of an app in the current Space without triggering Spaces switch, right-click on the app in Dock - \"New Window\".\nThis approach works for most apps, however it won't work for some apps (triggering annoying Spaces switch). Here is the last resort:\nIn short, it opens a new window of app without (triggering) switching Spaces. How:\nin the Space that you're working on and wish to have a new window of some app that already has other windows open in other Spaces, open Terminal.app (if necessary, set Terminal.app Keep in Dock and right-click on Terminal.app - \"New Window\") , run open -n /Applications/Appname.app\neg. open -n /Applications/Vivaldi.app A new window of the app will open in the current Space, as there wil be no annoying Spaces switch, your workflow in the current Space is not interrupted.\nReference: Assign Application Windows to Different Spaces/Desktops\n\nA: Disable the option under System Prefs -> Mission Control -> When switch to an application, switch to a space with open windows for this application\nfor some application this will not work, because some apps like TextMate open new documents in a new tab, but I’m pretty sure these apps have own options to prevent this!\n\nA: I think I finally got a fix, for Microsoft Word (and presumably other Office apps too): Make sure you have a Word window open in all workspaces... of course, you can make the window really, really tiny and pushed away into a corner. \nThis also helps with the jump to another workspace with an open window when you close \"the last\" (actually useful) window on a workspace. This is on Mavericks. \nA fully minimised (docked) window doesn't seem to do the job, though.\n", "Q: Change volume of airport using the master keys, not itunes volume slider My roommate recently bought an airport express, and I love it.  Minus the fact that when I'm blasting music and someone wants to talk to me, I need to open iTunes and either lower the volume or pause the song.\nI am so used to usng the f11 f12 keys that this is driving me insane!\nI read somewhere about sizzling keys and how it can help me assign a different shortcut to control iTunes volume.  Is there a different, or better, fix?\nI would love to be able to use f10-12, and not the iTunes volume.\nNote:  I am on a Macbook Pro 2012 with standard keyboard, so currently, f10 is mute, f11 lower, f12 raise volume.  They work fine when I'm not using airport.\nSOLUTION\ngithub.com/alberti42/iTunes-Volume-Control\nThis created assigned cmd - volume key to iTunes so I can control the iTunes volume with very little effort!\n\nA: This might do what you wanted, however I did not test it my self.\nhttps://github.com/alberti42/iTunes-Volume-Control\n\nA: I was wondering how Apple could possibly have missed such an obvious thing. All of these answers miss the mark by a bit. Turns out there's a super straightforward answer.\nSystem Preferences -> Sound -> Output tab -> Select a device for sound output -> switch it to Airport Express (presuming you're connected to your Airport Express). Now the whole system sound output will be Airport Express and you can use the volume (and mute) buttons as usual with no tricks or sketchy/buggy third-party apps. Moreover, this will now output all your sound, so for example also from YouTube, etc.\nI believe system sound effects can be chosen to go through a separate device too, which is nice--click the Sound Effects tab -> Play sound effects through.\nMoreover, if you want to switch back & forth between Airport Express and speakers as output device, tick \"Show volume in menu bar\" at the bottom of sound preferences. This puts a volume icon in your right hand menu bar. OPTION-click on it lets you quickly switch output devices.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the \"Keyboard\" System Preferences (\"Keyboard\" from spotlight)\n\n*Click on the \"Shortcuts\" tab.\n\n*Click on \"App Shortcuts\" in the bottom of the list on the left.\n\n*Click the \"+\" below the list on the right and add the following shortcuts:\na. iTunes, Increase Volume, fn+command+F12 (or whatever you want)\nb. iTunes, Decrease Volume, fn+command+F11 (or whatever you want)\n\n*When you are finished you should have preferences configured like this:\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think iTunes has a menu item for \"Mute\" so you can't use this trick for the mute button. You also apparently need to include fn in your key binding. If those are problems for you, check out the apps suggested in the other answers. But this is a nice, free, solution.\n\nA: Here's a $1.99 app that sets the volume keys to only apply to iTunes (use cmd modifier to adjust system volume):\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/volume-for-itunes/id467973245?mt=12\n\nA: This is a late comment, but if anyone happens upon this, the standard keyboard shortcuts are command + up arrow for increase volume and command + down arrow for decrease volume. To check, you can click on the controls menu tab when in iTunes and scroll down - you should see them there. Alternatively, you can set up your own shortcuts as Code Commander listed above.\n\nA: Mine didn't seem to work with the F11 & F12 because i think that has to be the comps volume. what I did instead is \n\nat least their near the keys but it will only work when you have Itunes open in front of you.  \nHope that helps. \n\n\n*\n\n*MH\n\n\nA: I ended up using a free tool called FastScripts (https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/, free for 10 shortcuts).

Im having an old 2008 time capsule to store the backups of my system. Im planning to buy the new 2013 time capsule soon but need to know if it supports the following:\nBackup data ( music, movies ) *beside the system backups without messing with them or    \ndeleting them in any way?\n\nI have tried this with my 2008 model but it would sometimes wipe the data. \nAnyone can confirm this works correctly?\nAlso is the new wifi module really 3x times faster as claimed and in result backups your data a lot faster?\n\nA: Time Machine is the software that runs on your Mac so that won't change at all with the new device.\nI would run a few manual backups from the command line on your existing Time Capsule to see what amount of data you are backing up and how long it takes:\n date; tmutil startbackup --block; date\n\nOnce you have a feeling for what your speeds are, you can start to determine what the bottleneck is. If your Mac takes too long to send the files itself due to a busy filesystem and CPU - no external upgrade will help. If you are waiting on the hard drive in the Time Capsule - that too is the same technology and you should expect minor speedups as the controller seems to be marginally faster in the new Time Capsule. Only if your bottleneck is the network speed between the Mac and the Time Capsule will the faster network make a difference for the time spent backing up.\nThe new antennas are working very well for cases where we have one or two machines at the edge of the wireless range - but we don't have many of the new Air that speak 802.11ac yet so although some speedup is possible - it's not as dramatic as the benchmarks show except in some limited circumstances.\n\nA: What you want to do is partition the Time Capsule hard drive. Before you activate Time Machine, you'll want to launch Disk Utility and partition the drive into two halves. Then choose one as your Time Machine drive and use the other to backup your music and movies the old fashion way.\nAnother option would be to purchase an additional external USB hard drive and connect it via the Time Capsule's USB port. It may be a little wonky, but it should work for your purposes.\nps: When I get home this evening, I'll update this post with screenshots to illustrate. And do a little more research on external drives.\n", "Q: More than one banner in Notification Center My question is simple, but I think, it's impossible. When more than one banner in Notification Center are rises, previous of them are ends and show last banner only. It would be nice if banners shows as a badges. I think we can't to change this, isn't it?\n\nA: I think your issue is with the behavior of banners versus alerts. \nBanners by design appear for several seconds and then disappear.\nAlerts are designed to stay put. You can change the way an application's Notifications behave in the Notifications Preference Pane.\nSo switch your app's behavior to show alerts instead of banners and you should be fine.\nUnless, of course, I'm misunderstanding your question.\n\n", "Q: If I transfer songs to a zip drive and reload, can I get them out of \"Purchased\"? I no longer have access to the email address associated with my Apple ID, so I'll need to create a new one pretty soon. All possible ways to recover my current Apple ID have been exhausted, so that isn't the issue. I'm wondering if I transfer purchased songs to a zip drive or burn them onto a CD, will I then be able to transfer them back to iTunes but not as purchased content and therefore be able to play them with my new ID? I'm not very technology savvy, so I hope this isn't a dumb question. \n\nA: This is a bit of a grey area around fair use, but there is software out there that will allow you to remove the drm from iTunes songs. Given that the songs they currently sell do not have any drm, I think it's not a particularly immoral option.\nIf you want to stay on the clearly bright side of the law, burning the songs to a cd and then re-ripping them will remove the drm and is supported through iTunes.

I currently have a 2008 Mac Pro with 2 Radeon HD 2600 XT video boards, each of which is driving two monitors. This setup performs acceptably, though I wouldn't be averse to faster GPUs. However, the machine periodically crashes (sometimes multiple times a day, sometimes goes for days without doing so, with no discernible pattern) with a large amount of GPU debug mode error messages in the system log. As far as I can tell, this is likely caused by either some driver bug which remains or one of the video boards is failing. This has been going on for quite some time, and while I've reported it to Apple, I don't have high hopes of it being fixed in software anytime soon.\nSo my question is this - what new video boards can I put in this machine that will still get me four DVI monitor hookups?\n\nA: What version of OS X? That'll be your limiting factor on GPU support, I think. The 2008 Mac Pro (3,1) had two 16x PCIe slots, so any PCIe video card supported by your version of OS X should work. The official list:\nGraphics cards for Mac Pro (Early 2008)\n\n\n*\n\n*ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT (part number 630-9191 or 630-9897)\n\n*NVIDIA Quadro FX 5600\n\n*ATI Radeon HD 4870, offered as an upgrade kit\n\n\nNote: The Radeon HD 4870 card requires Mac OS X v10.5.7 or later for use with the Mac Pro (Early 2008).\nGraphics cards for Mac Pro (Early 2009)\n\n\n*\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce GT 120\n\n*ATI Radeon HD 4870\n\n*ATI Radeon HD 5870, offered as an upgrade kit\n\n\nNote: The Radeon HD 5870 card requires Mac OS X v10.6.4 or later and it requires the use of both auxiliary power connections.\nNewer cards with OS X support may work, but there are caveats with pre-2010 Mac Pros and I doubt they'd be officially supported.\n", "Q: Syncing OS X Notes with iCloud I can sync notes when I am connected directly to the internet but not via our corporate lan.\nOur network has http/https open but most other ports are blocked.\nWhich ports does the OS X Notes app use for syncing so that I can request for them to be opened?\n\nA: Notes in Mac OS and iOS are still based on IMAP email.

Time Machine makes a bunch of backups, though.  It takes hourly snapshots, then retains daily snapshots covering the last month, and then retains weekly snapshots for all prior months.  tmutil compare only uses the most recent hourly backup.\nAll these snapshots will remain on your backup drive until the drive starts running out of space.  Then the oldest backup data is purged.  Until you hard drive is basically full, it will continue to fill.\nMost of the files shown in your comparison are things that OS X or other software fiddle with pretty frequently.  You don't need to do a lot to trigger changes to those files; every login, etc. will result in changes.  So, while you barely used the computer, if we're talking about a long enough period of time it looks like the computer has kept itself plenty busy enough to populate 2.7G of Time Machine backup/revision data :)\nUpdated to answer question in comment below\nLet's take the literal question \"Where is the 2.7G that TM transfered?\"  The answer is: Nowhere, because TM did not transfer 2.7G.\nBetter question: \"Why does TM show a 2.7G transfer, but tmutil compare shows a 624K transfer?  Why are these two numbers not in agreement?\"  Strictly speaking, TM isn't showing a 2.7G transfer but 2.7G of something related, but different.  That \"something different\" depends on what you're looking at.\nIf we are looking at the size of the Time Machine drive or sparsebundle, those contain multiple backups.  If we are looking at the drop-down menu from the TM menubar icon during a transfer, that shows the full size of files involved in the transfer and not the size of the transfer itself.  TM figures out which files have been updated since the last backup, and then sums the full sizes of these files to provide a rough progress report in the drop-down menu (like a textual \"progress bar,\" if you will).  Where possible, TM transfers the updated parts of those files instead of the full files (to avoid duplication of data, and to speed the backup process).\nIf \"TM shows\" you 2.7G somewhere else, we'd have to know where that somewhere else is before being able to answer this question.  Screenshot, perhaps?\n", "Q: Does LaunchAgent prevent repetitive execution of jobs? I want to automate the execution of a long-running job. It should be launched once per day but only if the prior job isn't still running. Can I accomplish this with launchd and how?\n\nA: Yes, launchd ensures you only have one instance of the \"agent\" running and it does this for you automatically. Set your job up normally using StartInterval to schedule the execution of your background job and the system won't launch a new instance if the previous instance hasn't completed by the time it gets to that scheduled start interval.\nIf multiple schedule intervals pass, launchd will run just one new instance at the next interval. It's \"smart\" about it.\nHere's a sample plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> \n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd  \n\"> \n<plist version=\"1.0\"> \n<dict> \n     <key>Label</key> \n     <string>com.mycompany.test</string> \n     <key>ProgramArguments</key> \n     <array> \n         <string>/some/path/to/a/script.sh</string> \n     </array> \n     <key>StartInterval</key> \n     <integer>60</integer> \n</dict> \n</plist>\n\nIn the above example, if /some/path/to/a/script.sh takes 361 seconds to run, launchd won't start 5 new instances during that time frame, and it will only start one new instance at the 420'th second mark in time.\nThe wording on the launchd.plist(5) man page says as much, but the way it's written kind of makes it non-obvious:\n\nStartInterval \nThis optional key causes the job to be started\n  every N seconds.  If the system is asleep, the job will be started the\n  next time the computer wakes up.  If multiple intervals transpire\n  before the computer is woken, those events will be coalesced into one\n  event upon wake from sleep.\n\nThat last sentence essentially says \"launchd makes your jobs singleton for you as long as you follow the rules for good job behaviour\".\n", "Q: Run a program without networking? Is there a way to run a program on OS X (e.g., from the command line) but without letting it see the network?\nI can turn off and disconnect all networking, but then all my other processes will be disconnected, too.  I'd like to keep my email, web browser, etc., able to use the network, but this one program isolated.\nEDIT: I found this question which is similar, but it uses a static route when the destination host is known.  I want to disable networking for all possible hosts, for this one process.\n\nA: TCPBlock\n\nTCPBlock is a lightweight and fast application firewall ... you can prevent selected applications on your computer from opening connections to the network.\n\nTCPBlock is currently free and can be downloaded here.\n", "Q: Can I power on my old MacBook with a no-lights battery? I've let my MacBook's battery go far too long past its life because it lives at a desk and never moves. It's a MacBook Pro 4,1. \nOn MacBook Pro 3, i was always able to boot without battery, but this one will not boot after SMC reset with or without battery installed. \nPressing the battery's charge checker button does not light up any LEDs now. Previously it would rapidly blink the first LED , indicating it needs replacement. \nIs there any way to boot? (I'm aware it will run at lower clock speed)\n\nA: Normally you should be able to, and even Apple says so, by providing a warning and a CPU clock speed reduction.\nIf it does not work on your computer.....\nYou might be having a problem with the MagSafe adapter or SMC. \nYour machine should turn on normally whether or not the battery is in it. \nThe only problem you'll have with the battery removed is that machine will run slower - but that's by design. \nWhen you get the new battery, make sure you try another MagSafe adapter to be safe.\nTry another SMC reset by Holding the power button for 5 or 10 seconds.\n", "Q: Why do I keep having to reenter the SIM code after each iOS update? With my iPhone 5, I've been finding that I keep having to unlock the SIM code every time I update the iOS from one minor release to the next. While this isn't a problem, as I've memorized the code, it is rather annoying.\nIs there any way to change this behavior, so that I don't have to keep worrying about this?\n\nA: Is this a 'SIM PIN'?  If so, go to settings - phone - SIM PIN and turn it to off.\n\nA: There's no setting to specifically avoid having to enter the SIM PIN after an update.\nIt is however possible to disable the PIN lock on the SIM entirely. The steps are:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app\n\n\n*Tap Cellular\n\n\n*Tap SIM Pin\n\n\n*Tap to disable SIM PIN\nYou will need to know the PIN in order to disable it.\nNote that disabling the PIN comes with associated risks. If your SIM card or the phone with the SIM is ever stolen, a thief would be able to use your SIM card - including calling others from your phone number, ranking up your phone bill, getting SMS 2FA codes and downloading contacts that you have stored on the SIM.\n", "Q: iMessage help! my imessage has been hacked My brother has checked all my past iMessages on his mac from my iPhone that have been deleted. How is that possible? Is there away there any way my iMessages can be permanently deleted so they cant be read? How can I keep him from viewing my messages? Is he hacking me?\n\nA: If you fear someone is hacking your account, you'll want to go to your Apple ID and reset the password.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://appleid.apple.com/\nIf you have forgotten or lost your password, you can also reset it:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://iforgot.apple.com/\nOnce you are in to the first site, be sure to check the additional email addresses and contact information should any of that be changed.\n\nA: I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that your Apple ID is being shared between your iPhone and your brother's Mac.  I've seen people share their Apple IDs inside their families because they want to share content or apps before; it's a practice I don't recommend.\nWhen you have additional devices registered with iMessage like that, the entire conversations will be synchronized to both the iPhone and the Mac and—I just verified this, because I wasn't sure—deleting the messages from the iPhone does not delete them from the Messages application on OS X.\nTo prevent your iMessages from continuing to appear on the Mac, you will have to deregister the Mac.  I believe you can do this by visiting My Support Profile, logging in with your Apple ID, clicking the Mac which should appear in the list, and clicking Unregister.\nIt is probably also a good idea to change your Apple ID password.\n", "Q: Toggle Mail Classic View in Mountain Lion with I found a script on this site which I edited to make work with Mountain Lion, I thought.

I have a (legit) copy of Star Wars Battlefront 1 for the Play Station 2 (PS2). There are game mods available (different character skins etc) that I'd like to try. Apparently this can be done but I'm tearing my hair out now...\nI can make an image of the original DVD using Disk Utility. It creates a CDR file. When I burn that to a DVD-R (again, using Disk Utility), I can get the PS2 to load the game (using Swap Magic to load the DVD-R, this PS2 is not modded -- Swap Magic \"soft mods\" it to load burned DVDs).\n$ file SWBF1.iso\nSWBF1.iso:                      UDF filesystem data (version 1.5) '1_01                           '\n$\n\nSo having this much work all looks good but what I want to do now is modify some of the files before burning the DVD-R.\nOSX won't let me edit the ISO (CDR) image. Apparently this is because ISO9660 is not really designed to allow modifications, so even using command line utilities (hdiutil) with -readwrite option won't allow me to modify the image.\nSo I suspect I need to extract the files onto the file system, add/modify the game data files for the game mod, then create a new ISO image and burn that? But this is not working -- I'm just creating coasters now. (The Mac can read the burned DVD but the PS2 doesn't recognise the disk as being valid). This for example, fails to give the desired result:\n$ cd /path-to-extracted-files\n$ hdiutil makehybrid -udf -udf-volume-name 1_01 -o SWBF1_mod.iso .\n$ hdiutil burn SWBF1_mod.iso \n$ file ../*.iso\n../SWBF1.iso:                      UDF filesystem data (version 1.5) '1_01                           '\n../SWBF1_mod.iso:                  data\n\nHow can I modify files on a DVD ISO image to make this work?\nThanks\n[Edit: I originally mentioned PS2 in the title but that's a red herring really. This problem seems to exist for anyone wanting to modify an ISO image on OS X. See for example this old discussion of the same problem.]\n\nA: I know of two techniques to modify readonly disk images - using either a sparse image or a shadow file.  Here is what to do using a shadow file:\nCreate an image of your cdr (which you have already done)- I will call this xxx.cdr.\nUse hdiutil attach xxx.cdr -shadow which mounts the read-only xxx.cdr image along with a shadow file where all changes will kept.  So it behaves like a mounted read/write image.\nMake your changes.\nUnmount the disk - you will now have xxx.cdr and xxx.cdr.shadow\nNow run:\nhdiutil convert -format UDTO -o newxxx.cdr xxx.cdr -shadow\n\nThen burn the newxxx.cdr to `DVD-R.\nThis is the method I have used to create a Snow Leopard image for use by Parallels or VMware. My posting in a MacRumors Thread is just part of a long discussion.  \nYou may need to vary the above to suit your particular needs - I have no direct experience of working with PS2 images.\n", "Q: Failure to backup files from Mac partition while in Windows 8 partition I am running Windows 8 and OS X Lion using Bootcamp, and ran into an issue where OS X is no longer bootable (empty gray progress bar on startup).  Googling this error led me to believe it could be any number of things, but regardless it seems the best (least painful) way to solve it is to reinstall OS X.\nI am able to run the Windows 8 partition with no problem, and thought I could backup my important files from OS X to an external hard drive and then use the Recovery partition to reinstall OS X.\nThe issue is that, when I attempt to copy files from the Mac partition (no issue with the Windows partition), the copy/paste dialog 'discovers' all the files and then silently fails without copying.  I have seen a few possibilities for this error, however in following their steps (take ownership of target directory, drag and drop instead of copy/paste), nothing seems to work.\nI don't want to clone the partition in case if there is something bad that I would be copying along with the clone, leaving me in the same state I'm currently in.  If it is the case that the HDD is failing, I would still like to have the backup of the information I need.\n\nA: I did manage to recover a fair amount of the files I needed through Windows, and if anybody else has this issue it is very helpful.  I never even considered this option among the many others, but somehow it managed to pull the majority of my files off and onto an external drive.\nI loaded Windows PowerShell in Administrator mode and ran the following script (it was a script to only copy directories that have files, but without modification it worked successfully):\n$path = 'C:\\source\\directory'\n$destination = 'e:\\destination\\directory’\n\nGet-ChildItem $path -Directory |\n    Foreach-Object  {if (($_.enumeratefiles() | measure).count -gt 0)\n    {\n        Copy-Item -path $_.fullname -Destination $destination -Recurse}\n    }\n\n\nA: If you are uncomfortable with that, you can also try some Windows solutions. I assume you already have Boot Camp Software installed in Windows, which would allow you to see your mac files (read only), but if not, or not in a while, download and install them here: Apple Boot Camp Software(latest version as of July 1, 2013)\nYou can also try a piece of 3rd party software called MacDrive 9 Standard. It has a lot of features for accessing and even possibly repairing Mac partitions from within Windows. MacDrive 9\n\nA: I’ve had to recover files (usually from dying disks) multiple times, and from what I’ve tried and learned, this is (currently), my preferred method.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an external harddrive, that can hold the maximum size of the one you want to recover from.\n\n*Get RIP Linux, and boot your computer with it.\n\n*Clone the harddrive to a file (on the external drive), by running ddrescue --direct --max-retries=10 ${inputDevice} ${outputFile} logFile.log. By doing this, you’ll have a file that you can access faster and try different recovery tools on. Keeping the log file also means you can interrupt the cloning and continue it later. The real command will actually depend, so if you’re not confortable with the command-line, say something so we can point you the right way to do it.\n\n*Get PhotoRec to recover your files.\n\n\nA: You could try a filesystem check from Single-User Mode\nStart up the Mac while holding option, and then select your Macintosh HD, and before pressing the return key, press and hold the Command key and the S key. while holding them, press return, and once the screen goes black and text appears, let of of the Command and S keys.\nWhen it finishes loading, you'll get a section of text as follows:\nSingleuser boot -- fsck not done\nRoot device is read-only\nIf you want to make modifications to files:\n    /sbin/fsck -fy\n    /sbin/mount -uw /\nif you wish to boot the system:\n    exit\n:/ root#\n\nSome other messages may pop up after that, but once you see that on your screen, type that first sbin command:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n\nThat'll go though, check your filesystem for errors, and try to repair them, and if it does, then it will recheck, and rerepair if needed, up to three times.\nKeep running that till it doesn't bring up \"repairing\" messages, or you get the EXACT same repairing messages twice in a row.\nAt that point, type reboot and see if it starts up. This is similar to using Recovery HD's disk utility to repair disk, but definitely has a higher success rate.\nIf at any point you get a:\nRead: I/O error\n\nthen it means either the Hard Drive, Hard drive Cable or SATA controller is failing.\nThough, if you are running Windows without a problem in boot camp from the same hard drive, it's not too likely that the Drive or SATA controller is failing.\nAlso, if you get up to your user account screen, when you type in your password, hold the shift key and then press the return key, and let go of the shift key when you see your desktop, so that you start up with the minimum startup applications and processes.\nIf you get it booting, I recommend copying all your files off to another disk, reformatting your Macintosh HD volume and Reinstalling OS X, since the FSCK single user method mostly just gets your drive to a workable state but doesn't usually prevent it from degrading in the future.\n\nA: Use a Live-CD of Ubuntu (or others) to access your hard drive and backup up all you data.\n", "Q: How to use font installed without rebooting the system? I have a problem with Mac OS. I copied new font file to /Library/Fonts folder. I want to use that font without rebooting or logging off the system.\nIs there a way to add a font without restarting my Mac?\nThanks.\n\nA: You should not try to install fonts by copying them to the /Library/Fonts folder. This may cause problems.\nTo install fonts start the FontBook app (Applications/Utilities) and use the command Add Font … in the File menu . This will activate the new font(s) and you can use them immediately without a reboot. This procedure is useful if you want to install several fonts at the same time.\nIf you only want to install one or two fonts, you can double click on the font(s) and click the Install button in the preview window of Font Book.\nIn FontBook you can also activate, deactivate or delete fonts, group them, etc. \nOnce you add the font to FontBook, you'll need to quit the app you are using (like Pages) and reopen it; at that point, the font will show up.\n\nA: Double click on the font file.

I know how to enable WebGL in Safari (8.0.7) for OS X (10.10.4) and I am able to visualize and interact with WebGL based content, however I'm concerned that it is disabled by default, given that the browser can actually support it.\nIs there a reason (perhaps stability, or security) that WebGL is disabled by default in Safari?\n\nA: If you're really scared, yes. WebGL allows web developers to code shaders which run unprotected in the GPU. This can cause many security issues because there aren't really any antiviruses to protect against GPU infections.\nThe risks aren't too great because there are organizations such as Google and Khronos working on making it much safer. These organizations are really quick in creating patches and fixes for issues and flaws.\nI'm really not sure about how unsafe WebGL is in Safari, however, because it's based off of Webkit, I'm quite sure it's pretty similar to Chrome.\n\nA: In 2017, researchers created a proof-of-concept showing that WebGL can be used to fingerprint your machine with high accuracy, even across multiple browsers.[1]  So you might want to leave it disabled for privacy reasons.\n", "Q: Firewall with application rules for iPad I've read some other topics about not needed firewall for iPad's, but I'm searching the other way of security or (more important) to help my budget.\nI need firewall that has incoming/outcoming rules for every app. Rules should be remembered and asked only once, but easily to change.

It effectively turns your Mac into a Bluetooth keyboard that you can connect your iPhone to. Anything you type into the app gets sent to the phone.\nUnfortunately there's no way to use a mouse to interact with the touch screen (and frankly, if you've ever used the iOS Simulator, you'd realize it's fairly limiting to do so), but Type2Phone should get most of what you're looking for.\n", "Q: What is the software to move screen/laptop to apple TV screen I have seen users that drag their screen to AppleTV on WiFi for presentations and such.

My wish is to modify the \"Move to Trash\" command's shortcut inside the File menu of Finder and map to this key, just like how it is done in Windows. There was a problem with Home and End keys, but I searched and got the fix (by creating and editing DefaultKeyBindings.dict) file.

There's an option to show the certificate which prompts with checkbox to 'always trust' and I have it selected, but whenever I connect I get the same message.   Is there something that I can do to avoid the warning message?\n\nA: From your description, one of two things is likely happening.\nHere's what's supposed to happen, your IT department should package the certificates you need to \"trust\" their servers and networks and they should provide them and hopefully not change the certificates every few weeks or months. Better, they could pay for a real certificate that's signed by a trusted broker and your Mac would just know it was a valid certificate and not just something the IT department self-signed.\nYour Mac should take the certificate needed and enter it into your keychain when you tell it to \"always trust\" the certificate, but that isn't working as well.\nSo - you could troubleshoot your keychain (start with the help menu in keychain access program) or learn more about how that works. You could ask IT to point you to the actual certificates and learn how to store them in your keychain or the system keychain. You'll want to run the Certificate Assistant from Keychain Access if you choose to store the certs locally since it will help you know if you have a good chain of trust and to debug things, since this usually takes several tries if you're not in the habit of installing custom certs into OS X.\n", "Q: Keyboard macros with Quicksilver I would like to use Quicksilver to insert a given text in the active window at the current cursor location. Is this possible?\nOne solution might be that I have a collection of files with the required text snippets and when I type the name I get a command that says something like \"Insert content of file in current document.\" However, I could not find such a command in the default list. I also tried to install the \"Text Manipulation Plugin\", but it appears that it doesn't offer this kind of functionality. One answer on Superuser suggests that this might still be possible, but did not reveal how: https://superuser.com/questions/113645/keyboard-macro-program-for-os-x\nAlternatively, I have looked into Applescript and it seems to be an easy exercise there. But I wonder if there is any alternative to writing dozens of Applescripts and triggering them using Quicksilver.\n\nA: Sounds like the exact use case for the Shelf Plugin for Quicksilver. That plugin gives you a place where you can put stuff (can be anything you can have in the first pane in Quicksilver, but in your case it will be text snippets) and then easily call them up again and use them.\nFor that to work you need to install both the Shelf Plugin and the Clipboard Plugin. \nThen you can call up Quicksilver, enter a text snippet in the normal Quicksilver text entry mode and choose \"Put on Shelf\" as action.\nTo see what's on the shelf, you call up Quicksilver, and use the shortcut ⌘+⌥+s. That brings up a little window showing you all the things on your shelf. when that window is open, you can also use the mouse to drag any text to that window to add it to the shelf.\nThe best way to use the things on the shelf is this: Set up a trigger with \"Shelf\" as the object and \"Show contents\" as action. That opens the contents of the shelf in the normal Quicksilver interface, so you can search them or just scroll through them. Once you selected the text snippet, you can use the \"Paste\"/\"Paste as Plain Text\" actions to paste it in your document.\nThere are some more cool things about that plugin: If you use the mouse from time to time, you can have easy access to the shelf window by dragging it to the side of the screen. If it's close enough to the edge of the screen, the window will slide into the edge and hide there. To call it up again, just move the mouse to that edge of the screen and it will slide out again. You can then use the mouse to drag-and-drop stuff from the shelf to wherever you need them.\nThe Clipboard Plugin has a similar window that provides a history of what you copied and pasted, which is also very handy. \n", "Q: Boot Ubuntu 12 on Mac Mini with Lion OS How can I boot Ubuntu-12.04 LTS on Mac Mini Lion Server (early 2011) with no CD reader?\n\nA: *\n\n*Make a bootable Ubuntu flash drive\n\n*Insert it in your computer\n\n*Hold Option key while booting\n\n*Select USB for boot\n\n*Install Ubuntu \n\n", "Q: Get cpu usage per core on the command line Activity monitor allows users to see the cpu usage on a per-core basis (for multicore machines, e.g. my MacBook Pro).

Cheers.\n\nA: Tanium does not have a keylogger although it does have the ability to read your website history or install a keylogger.\n\"Systems Management\" allows large enterprises to inventory, track and control the millions of dollars they spend on equipment. You work for your employer and they \"lend\" you their laptop for you to use to help them do business. \n\nA: Mr. Google sends you to the Tanium website, where you will find Tanium is a systems management tool for enterprises. If you want to disable it, you'll probably need to contact the IT department that put it on the machine in the first place.

I'm using vmWare Fusion 5.0.3 on Mac OS X, and the guest OS is also Mac OS X.\nThe problem: I can't set the guest OS display resolution to a reasonable value. \"Reasonable\" here means anything that will fit on my MacBook Air's 1440x900 screen. Right now it's using 1680x1050. I can get (a) a window that fits the 1680x1050 guest display but which is bigger than my physical display, or (b) a window that fits my display but scales down the 1680x1050 to a painfully small size so that it all fits. If I go to full screen I also get 1680x1050 scaled to fit the screen.\nI tried resizing the window, but that just changes the window size and scaling-- I still get 1680x1050 on the guest OS.\nI'm not too picky as to size, but I want something that actually fits on my screen.\nFor what it's worth, I do have vmWare tools installed. I reinstalled them just to make sure, it didn't help.\n\nA: I fixed this by, basically, screwing around with /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist on the guest copy of Mac OS X and getting lucky. First I tried removing that file and rebooting, but that didn't help. Next, I noticed that the 1680x1050 resolution was stored in that file, so I decided to edit it and change the numbers to 1440x900 (I figured if it's going to force a fixed resolution, I'll at least make it match the physical display) and rebooted.\nThe result is that the normal resize behavior is back. Changing the vmWare window size now updates the guest OS's screen resolution, as would normally be the case.\nI don't know why this worked, but things are back to normal now.\n\nA: Your solution didn't work for me, at least when using the Mac OS X Mavericks.\nWhat worked actually was holding ⌥ Opt while clicking on the Scaled option, as described in a post on VMware forums.\n", "Q: I purchased & downloaded Mountain Lion, and then...nothing happened I purchased Mountain Lion through the App Store on my 10.7.5 MacBook Pro.\nThe download completed and I clicked through the prompts to choose an install location and agree to the terms.\nI'm sorry to say I'm not sure what happened next as I shifted my attention to another computer.\nI assumed the install process was running.\nHowever, when I looked back at my MBP, I was back on the desktop with no sign of activity.\n(It's conceivable that I clicked \"cancel\" by mistake -- I'm kind of tired/distracted/trying to juggle several things at once today.)\nI went back to the App Store, looked under \"purchases,\" and found Mountain Lion labelled as \"downloaded\" (as I would expect).\nHow can I restart the installation?\nCan I go to the downloaded file and click on it?

I'd like to develop/publish an app that lets other make \"mini apps\" and provide them within the main app. I've read before that Apple discourages apps that 'replicate the function of the app store'. But what if the app only lets you buy the \"mini apps\" with existing credit from in-app purchases from Apple?\nEdit: I feel like I didn't use an appropriate example and left things open to speculation, as was mentioned by the editor. Here is something more concrete: I want to create a social app with core functions (such as messaging and profiles), but I want to allow other developers to create their own \"mini apps\" within the app to extend functionality. For example, a developer could create a tic-tac-toe mini game, that lets users interact in that way, and users could activate/download that within the main app without having to install a whole new separate app from the app store.\nSo now the concrete question is, does this functionality/use-case violate Apple's rules?\n\nA: Short answer: No.\nIn the past, Apple has specifically prohibited any app that loads other application code. While that's been relaxed a little, and you can now publish programming tools, you still cannot use an app as a way to sell other apps.\nDon't bother spending the $99. I can guarantee you that if you do what you're saying, Apple will reject your app out of hand.\nInstead, consider implementing your project as a web site, where you can do whatever you want with no restrictions.\n\nA: Apple does not publish their detailed App Review rules publicly, so you might need to spend $100 to dip your toes in that pool. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/appstore/guidelines.html\nSpecifically, the terms of the sale say \"no refunds\", but if you legitimately contacted them within a week or so of joining and explained exactly how you felt the T&C don't work for your business model, I suppose they might give you a refund if you really made a good case that the terms of the sale were hidden from you until you paid. You could also sign up as a free developer and ask them to disclose the terms before you bought a one year developer account - but most people I know just invest the $100 to kick off their first year as a developer with access to NDA agreements and details about what Apple prefers to sell on their App Stores.\nIt's not clear what you gain with an App in this category since you can just be part of the iTunes affiliate program and get paid to refer people to purchase other apps. Again, some apps have worked in this class, others have worked and been pulled and others never were approved in the first place. I think the main idea is you'll want a frank dialog with Apple about what they consider to be \"paid promotion\" or \"gaming the ratings\" and what they consider fine editorial promotion of apps you have reviewed.\n", "Q: What is this flickering menu bar icon?

I have a Nordic/Norwegian keyboard.  I'm sitting on an iMac with Mountain Lion and are remoting to a Windows 7 computer with Remote Desktop Connection.  I can't find the < or > shortcut (pressing < gives a different character (pipe)).  Does anyone know?\nI am aware of this question and know how to find most other characters, having tried numerous combinations, but not the < sign.  I also know I can get the character palette, but that is just too slow when I need it relatively often.\nEdit:  I do not have a numerical pad on the keyboard.  This is the smallest version of the Nordic Mac keyboard and is the default delivered with an iMac in Norway.\nEdit 2:  Here is a picture of my keyboard:\n\nEdit 3:  Thanks to @koivo I learned that < is called an angle bracket.  I did some googling and found only one unanswered question asked at a different forum (ars technica).  I have also tried all sorts of key combinations, but no luck so far.\nEdit 4:  I have now learned that using CoRD (which is slightly buggy and discontinued in development) or Royal TS (which cost money) will give me angle brackets (<) on the angle bracket key itself.  However, I have added a bounty to see if it is possible to do with Remote Desktop Connection that comes with the iMac out of the box. \nEdit 5:  This is written after the correct answer and bounty has been awarded.  Even though a shortcut is available, using the free version of Royal TSX is just a simpler solution, as stated in one of the answers!\n\nA: Try going to System Preferences:Language & Text:Input Sources. Enable and display the keyboard viewer to get a better view of the next steps.\nThe first step to try is to turn on the U.S. keyboard.  This should cause shift+comma and shift+period to yield the desired characters, < and >, in place of ; and :.  You can switch between keyboard layouts either using the flag menu that will appear on the right of your menu bar, or by setting keyboard shortcuts.\nIf switching to the U.S. keyboard layout doesn't work, enable Unicode Hex Input to allow the entry of any Unicode characters by holding down option and typing the hex code point. <alt/option>003c yields < (LESS-THAN SIGN) and <alt/option>003e yields > (GREATER-THAN SIGN).  See http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf for a table of common ASCII based Unicode characters. LESS-THAN SIGN and GREATER-THAN SIGN are the official Unicode names for the angle brackets.\nFor what it's worth, when I turn on, for example, a Swedish keyboard on my U.S. system, the key to the left of the number 1 offers < and >, as opposed to what I see in your picture.  Showing the keyboard viewer should help clarify what to expect.\nFrom the other question you reference there is also the suggestion by @Tom Gewecke: \n\nPerhaps you could set up another keystroke to produce @ via system\n  preferences/language & text/text/symbol and text substitution.\n\n\nA: Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection is not supported on anything newer than Snow Leopard 10.6 and if you use it long enough on newer versions of OS X you'll probably run into other issues besides this one such as random crashes from my own personal experience.\nRoyal TSX is indeed free (with limitations) and has a plugin using FreeRDP under the hood which supports newer versions of RDP configured to require NLA (Windows 7+, Server 2008R2+). My suggestion is that you re-evaluate your decision to stick with RDC, it's a dead end unless Microsoft decides to update it and it's not looking as if they will.\nQuote from the Royal TSX site:\n\nRoyal TSX can be downloaded, installed and used for free without any\n  time limit (no trial expiration!) and without a license key.

If you change the default application from an information window, it normally also has an immediate effect on open.\nIf it wasn't that, com.apple.LaunchServices.plist can also be edited as XML:\nplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist\n\nApplying changes requires restarting. Logging out and back in isn't enough.\nYou could also try using duti or RCDefaultApp.\n\nA: You can add them to the LaunchServices.plist file. To do that you open the .plist (I did it in XCode, if you've not got XCode installed there's standalone packages you can get), then you add a new tag entry with the application and extension you want.

I regularly run several Java applications.  There are about 4 applications that eat up a gig of RAM each(as I see in the Activity monitor).  For the rest of the OS, I guess it is using another 3 gigs.  I typically only have 100-200mb free memory.  Is that the true memory I have available?  Or is a type of swap memory used?  Essentially, I have 8 gigs of  ram on the system, should I get 16 gigs?  I tend to see slow performance at the 100mb mark.  What about inactive memory, that typically runs at 3 gigs, is that memory available?\n\nA: The best pointer to see if you need more RAM is checking \"Page ins\" vs \"Page outs\" in \"Activity monitor\" \"System memory\" tab. A simple rule of the thumb is that if \"outs\" count is higher than \"ins\", you need more memory. This has to do with usage of hard drive providing virtual memory.\nAlso, there is lots of memory available in the inactive section. There are mostly things that programs designated as never to use again. But OS keeps them, so if you close a document, it still sits in RAM and can be opened instantaneously. If any other activity needs free memory, OS ditches data here and offers RAM to the system.\nYou can also try running:\npurge\n\ncommand in terminal, it forces disk and memory caches to be emptied.

I was having some issues with it, so I went into DFU mode and did a clean install.\nUnfortunately as soon as iTunes finished installing iOS 6, it automatically made a full back-up of my phone, and I now can't see the previous back-up I made. Please tell me it's still there!\nHow may I recover a previous back-up?\n\nA: [I realize this is an older question and may not solve the problem for the OP, but this answer is intended to provide guidance to others.]\nIf you use iTunes backups, there is only one backup (the latest) maintained per device at any point in time. So in this case the new backup overwrote the older backup, and it would be possible to recover only if a copy of ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ was made before the clean install (through Time Machine or any other solution), restoring that folder on the system and doing a restore from iTunes.\nYou can see the device backups (with the timestamps) available in iTunes by going to iTunes → Preferences and then navigating to the Devices tab.\nSome recommendations and points to note to avoid such a situation and have something to fall back to:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can have multiple backups in iCloud for a device and choose which backup to restore from (assuming there are no device/iOS compatibility issues).\n\n*Use both iCloud and iTunes backups together (once iCloud backup is turned on, automatic backups in iTunes would be turned off; so a manual backup would have to be triggered in iTunes).\n\n*When using iTunes backup, trigger a manual backup in iTunes followed by a manual backup in Time Machine before major changes to a device, like re-installing iOS or jailbreaking or recovering from older backups.\n\n\nSee:\nChoosing an iOS backup method (Should I use iTunes or iCloud to back up my iOS device?)\n\nA: Assuming you have older backups:\nMac OS: ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\nWindows XP: %AppData%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nWindows Vista: %AppData%\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nWindows 7: %AppData%\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nGo onto iTunes, right click on your device on the left-hand side bar, and their should be an option 'Restore From Backup', or something similar, click that and it'll restore your iPhone to a previous backup.\n\nA: You can see all backups in Itunes settings -> backup\nI think it keeps two or three latest backups\n\nA: If you have back up your iPhone data, you can restore from the backup.\nTo restore information from a backup, use one of the following methods after connecting your iOS device to the computer with which you normally sync:\nRight-click (or Control-click) the device and choose Restore from Backup\nIf you have a new phone, you can connect to iTunes and it will prompt to restore from your backup Solution from Apple.com: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1766\n", "Q: Can I move data from old to new Time Capsule through USB? The Apple knowledge base note on this question says to hardwire the Time Capsules and a computer together through ethernet, and transfer the data from TC1 to the computer to TC2, all through ethernet.\nI can see how getting 1 GB across this way will be monumentally slow.\nHowever there are these lovely little USB ports on both Time Capsules.  Is there a way for me to get the Time Capsule to copy the data from its internal hard drive to a USB external drive?  And then vice versa on the other Time Capsule, connecting to it the USB drive with the data from the first Time Capsule?\nA related question here might cover one direction, but not the other?  And only then if I can find an old version of Airport and the function is still supported by the old Time Capsule with upgraded software.\nI am trying the wired ethernet approach, and I see this when copying one of the sparsebundles:\n\nThat is with everything wired, and airport on the laptop and the old Time Capsule turned off.  I am sharing the old Time Capsule hard drive on the WAN, which is wired to the new Time Capsule LAN.  That laptop is on the new Time Capsule LAN.\nThe wired transfer ended up running at about 48 Mb/s or 6 MB/s.  The reason is that the USB-Ethernet dongle I used only supports 10/100 Base-T.  No GigE.  48+48 maxed out the 100.\nWhen I went to a Thunderbolt-GigE dongle, the rate went up, but only to 106 Mb/s (13.3 MB/s).  The drive in the new Time Capsule can average 1200 Mb/s (150 MB/s) writing.  The drive in the old Time Capsule can average 400 Mb/s (50 MB/s) reading.  So the GigE is still well shy of what I might expect from USB3, or even USB2.\n\nA: I'd suggest using rsync from the terminal. It may still be slow, however:\n\n\n*\n\n*It should be faster than finder.\n\n*You can stop the transfer any time. It will resume from where you left the next time you issue the same command.\n\n\nSo, it should both reduce required time and also make it possible to stop it and resume if you actually need to use your computer.\nsudo rsync -avPh --delete-after /path/to/original/gromit.sparsebundle/ /path/to/copy/of/gromit.sparsebundle/\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*-a: Archive (be recursive, preserve timestamps ownership etc).\n\n*-v: Verbose.\n\n*-P: Show progress and real-time transfer rate.\n\n*-h: Human readable output.\n\n*--delete-after: At the end of copying remove any files at the destination that don't exist at the source. This gives you the freedom to continue making backups on your old time capsule without worrying about excessive files being copied to the new one.\n\n\nImportant: The trailing slashes in the two paths are important! If omitted a new dir may be created when you resume the sync (i.e. /path/to/copy/of/gromit.sparsebundle/gromit.sparsebundle).\nAlso note that the transfer rate displayed with the -P parameter is not accurate when small files (a few KB) are transfered.\n\nA: Time Capsules are Gigabit Ethernet routers.  This means a top speed of 100 MB/s over cable (but is pretty unlikely).  It will however be comparable to the speed of USB2, so I think you should try it before dismissing Ethernet.\n\nA: The USB ports on the Time Capsules I've seen have type A sockets, so the Time Capsule (\"TC\") is a \"host\", which can only be connected to \"devices\" (eg hard drives, printers, not computers).  Apple has a Uses for the USB port of Time Capsule document which confirms this.  So it isn't possible to connect a TC directly to a Mac, or to another TC via USB.\nIt is possible to connect a USB hard drive to a TC, and \"archive\" the contents of the TC to that external drive, without the data passing through a Mac/PC.  This feature was added in the 7.3.1 firmware update: this TidBITS article gives details.  The feature does still seem to exist in the current AirPort Utility 6.3: press Archive Disk in the first dialogue shown below to reveal the sheet shown in the second.  (I say \"does still seem to exist\", because I thought I'd read that that feature had been removed, along with several others, in the redesigned AirPort Utility 6, but I must be remembering incorrectly.)\n\n\nHowever... although this allows the TC data to be copied to an external USB drive, I believe there is no similar method to copy data from an USB external drive.\nSo: back to Ethernet.\nTo see the speed that an Ethernet port on a Mac is currently using, use /Applications/Utilities/Network Utility.  See \"Link Speed\" in the Info tab (1 Gbit/sec, ie \"GigE\" in the screenshot below.)\n\n(I originally mentioned this in a comment on the question but thought it would be worth putting into a proper answer, as it seems to have been useful.)\nYou have seen improved performance from using a Thunderbolt-GigE adapter.  I suspect the bottleneck now is probably the processors inside the Time Capsules.  (I do remember reading about this, but can't find the reference now, sorry.)\nIf you are able, I'd suggest this plan:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take apart the older TC and remove the hard drive.\n\n*Plug the hard drive into your Mac using a SATA->USB adaptor, or using a spare drive enclosure if you have one.\n\n*Plug the new TC into your Mac using your Thunderbolt-GigE adapter.\n\n*You should now be able to see both drives in the Finder.\n\n*Copy the files using the Finder, or perhaps SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner.\n(I used a process similar to this when I upgraded the drive inside my TC from 1TB to 3TB recently.)\nHere, I'm assuming the processor in the older TC is the main bottleneck... and also that you don't mind voiding the warranty by opening it.  This involves removing the rubber base, which is glued on.  It is possible to take apart and later reassemble a TC without destroying the rubber base, if you use a hair drier etc to melt the glue and proceed carefully.  If you are also willing to open the new TC, connecting both hard drives via SATA->USB adaptors might give you the speediest results... although in that situation, you might find the USB bus bandwidth is the bottleneck.\n", "Q: How do I change my apple id country without a credit card?

I just installed two Airport Express routers in a restaurant to improve their wifi coverage.  The first device (AE1) is connected to the restaurant's DSL router via ethernet, and the second device (AE2) extends the network created by AE1 via wireless.  This is set up and working perfectly.  \nThe problem is, the restaurant is close to a lot of residential stuff, and they've had issues with people pirating their signal.  So, obviously, they would like to password protect their wifi, changing the password weekly, and providing it to customers upon request.  This would be simple enough with one device, but I'm confused as to how I can go about it with two devices.  \nShould I set up the WPA/WPA2 on AE2 first, then AE1?  Will AE2 even be able to extend AE1 if AE1's network is password protected?  I have many questions, but they all boil down to, is this even possible, and how can I do it?\n\nA: If AE1 (plugged into the router) is setup as a wireless access point, then put a WPA/WPA2 password on that wireless network.\nIf AE2 is setup via Airport utility to \"extend\" the wireless network of AE1, then it will automatically inherit the password setup from the primary (in this case AE1).  Any password changes you make to AE1 will be transparent and update across both devices.\nIf you have setup AE2 to \"join\" a wireless network, this will not happen.\nWith \"extend\" the end user will only see one wireless network, with the same name, not two different devices.

When someone connects to //driveA/Shared, then connects to //driveB/Shared, the //driveB/Shared folder overwrites the //driveA/Shared folder, because they are both named Shared. Even though it looks like both are connected, it can not find files from //driveA/Shared. So people can not have both folders open at the same time. I tried manually mounting them with:\nmount -t smbfs //drive1/Shared ~/drive1\nmount -t smbfs //drive2/Shared ~/drive2\n\nHowever, the problem still persist. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I would suggest that you change the domain names to simplify the problem, \nsay if they are in different room, use... R22shared and R23shared, or Serv1 shared / Serv2shared, this may get rid of you problem.\n", "Q: Mac Developer Program & free copies of OS X The Mac Developer program is advertised as including access to Pre-Release Software (which right now means betas of Mavericks). Once Mavericks is released, will everyone with a Mac Developer account get a free copy/upgrade to the released version (including all future Mavericks updates)? Or will it be necessary for developers to also purchase Mavericks itself to be able to use the normal version?\n\nA: Since Lion, the developer program issues its beta seeds of the OS using the Mac App Store.  You get a code in the developer portal which is redeemed in the Mac App Store. You can redeem this code on any Apple ID. It does NOT need to be the Apple ID that you  signed up with on the dev portal.  Once the final release is out, the beta seed in your App Store is transformed into the fully released version.\nSo yes, you do get it. And in fact, you will be unable to purchase it on the Apple ID with which you redeemed the seed.\n\nA: Mavericks is free for every Mac user :)\n\nA: I believe the developer previews have an expiry date on them (typically some modest period of time beyond the release of the next version/release version). In addition, to upgrade to point versions (i.e. 10.9.1, etc.), you need to be running the release version.\nSo while you could run the final release candidate for some time, for any sort of long term use, you'll want to buy it fully.\n", "Q: lpinfo -m -h 127.0.0.1:631 to verfy the printer drivers available on the system Can someone do me  favor and run the \n\nlpinfo -m -h 127.0.0.1:631\n\nthat will show the listing of all printer drivers installed on your computer.\nPlease tell me if you see more HP printers than what I have:\n\nI am missing HP drivers, but that is all I got for HP with my OS X 10.8.4 ??\n\nA: OK, I solved the problem #1\nI downloaded the HP drivers (all of them)\nfrom HP Printer Drivers v.2.14 for OS X\nStrangely the HP drivers were not included in OS X, and nobody tells you that.\nWhy would Apple include like million Brother drivers and only few HP is a mystery to me!\n", "Q: iMac ram memory installing 16GB vs 20GB I have a mid-2011 27\" iMac with i7 processor.  It came with 4 gigs of ram (2x2GB).  I just bought 2x8GB of matched memory.  I am wondering two things\n1.  is it good/bad/neutral to leave in the existing memory and add the 2x8 into the remaining two slots?\n2. If you say it doesn't matter if it shows up as 20GB installed, but will only use 16GB of it, then should I put those 2x8 in the upper slots (the ones the factory 2x2 are presently occupying) and either leave out the 2x2 or put them in the bottom 2 slots. IOW does it use the upper two slots first during processing?\nWhere can I find a speed test to see what difference it all makes?\n\nA: So many questions, but I'll try to break them down:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leaving in the current 2x2GB that it has is good, it's better than\n2x0GB.\n\n*All 20GB will be recognized, the only reason you'd want to replace the current 2x2GB chips with 2x8GB is purely for the additional RAM.\n\n*I recommend you pair the sticks up into the dual channel configuration for your iMac (as can be found online), so that one 8GB module and one 4GB module is on each of the two channels, enabling the use of dual channel memory speeds.\n\n\nA: You only have to make sure that the same modules are installed in \"dual channel\" slots, to utilize the additional speed. More RAM the better so 20G won't hurt. Selecting either \"upper\" or \"lower\" slots should not make any difference.\n", "Q: Lost contacts after turning off Exchange On my iPhone, I gave it to another person who used it and added contacts.  Later I turned off the calendar, contacts, ets. (he didn't have the password) but some of his contacts disappeared.  Can I recover them?\n\nA: When you delete Exchange account, sync deletes all of the contacts that are stored trough it. You can try to set up Exchange again to get that contacts synced on the phone (you said there is no password assigned) and then use this guide to keep them stored after turning off the Exchange account http://iphone-contacts.blogspot.com/2013/03/keep-your-exchange-contacts-on-your.html\n\nA: Method #1\nGo to settings/icloud on your phone.  Make sure you are logged with your Apple ID.\nContacts should be on, click on it to turn it off and choose keep (even though you show no contacts)\nWhen the process is done go ahead and turn on contacts again, choose merge.  All your contacts should show up if you had a previous backup to icloud.\nThe difficulty in restoring iCloud data from a back up is that the back up is older than the current version on iCloud and anything that is restored gets removed again when an iCloud sync occurs. \nSource\nMethod #2\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure the device is connected to your local network. \n\n*Start the restore from iCloud back up.\n\n*Allow the devices settings to restore (watch for the confirmation of\ncompletion). \n\n*As the apps begin to restore, disconnect your Internet (e.g. pull the connection to your router WAN port - the one that goes to the telephone point).\n\n*Wait for the time out confirmation.\n\n*Navigate to settings > iCloud and turn off contact syncing (keep\ncontacts when prompted).  \n\n*Reconnect the router to the internet and let the restore process\ncomplete.\n\n*Delete any iCloud contacts from iCloud.com on a computer.\n\n*Navigate to settings > iCloud and turn on contact syncing (merge\ncontacts when prompted).\n\n\nMay I suggest that you carry out a back up to iTunes before you try anything, that way should things become even worse, you can at least restore iPhone contacts back to where you are now.\nSource\n", "Q: How can I install a new dictionary on OS X for use with the \"Word of the Day\" screensaver? The reason is trivial: I am a fan of the \"Word of the Day\" screen saver and I would like to add dictionaries for languages other than English and Japanese (these are the two that I can select now in screen saver options).\nHow can I do it?\n\nA: If you have 10.8, you can enable French, German, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish dictionaries from the preferences of Dictionary.app:\n\nThey don't seem to be shown as choices for the Word of the Day screensaver though:\n\nI also tried restarting after enabling the dictionaries.\n\nA: In case anyone is still interested in this in 2018 and come across this..\nI just updated to OS X Mojave, and found a Word of the Day.saver file at /System/Library/Screen Savers/. In this package, go to Contents/Resources/WordLists/, and you can find the 5 .plist files used in the Mojave WotD (they added three Mandarin/Cantonese Chinese dictionaries). There you can use jsomers's method above.\nAlso it's been a while since Apple added the System Integrity Protection to the OS X, so you will have to disable it before writing to the .plist file. \nI'm quite happy that Apple haven't given up on the good old WotD, and updated it a little in Mojave. Hope they can provide even more dictionary choices in the future.\n\nA: On a rather obscure comment thread, someone explained where you might find the word list that Apple uses to power the screensaver. It is at /System/Library/Graphics/Quartz\\ Composer\\ Plug-Ins/WOTD.plugin/Contents/Resources/NOAD_wotd_list.txt. The file looks like this:\nm_en_us1282510  quinsy\nm_en_us1273791  orbicular\nm_en_us1220945  alimony\nm_en_us1250517  genome\n\nIt is a list of tab-separated entries. On the right you have the word, and on the left, what looks like an ID. But what's it an ID for, and how would you be able to find it for another word not already on the list?\nAs you might expect, the ID refers to an entry in Apple's default dictionary, the \"New Oxford American Dictionary\". (That's what \"NOAD\" stands for in the word-list path above.)\nHow to find the IDs for other words?\nA fellow named Joseph Gentle, in a series of blog posts, shows how to get at the data underlying Apple's dictionaries. In his \"Apple dictionaries, part 2\" post, he points to code that unpacks the relevant binary file (stored in /Library/Dictionaries) into XML. Using the dedict.c and strip.c files found here, and following Gentle's example, I used the following bash commands to get at the NOAD's XML (these commands are run from the directory where you downloaded the dedict.c and strip.c files):\nclang dedict.c -Wall -lz -o dedict\nclang strip.c -Wall -lz -o strip\n./dedict \"New Oxford American Dictionary\" | ./strip > dict.xml\n\nWhen I head-ed the first few lines of the dict.xml file, I saw something promising, with entries that looked like this:\n<d:entry xmlns:d=\"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/DictionaryService-1.0.rng\" id=\"m_en_us1219333\" d:title=\"abode\" class=\"entry\">\n\nNotice that id param... it's an identifier that looks exactly like the one in the screensaver word list!\nI wrote the following Ruby script to parse the XML, and then, using my own word list, create a new screensaver file that maps my own words to their IDs in the dictionary:\nraw = File.open(\"./dict.xml\").read\nmy_words = File.open(\"./word_list.csv\").readlines.map { |line| line.split(',')[1] }\n\nword_id_map = {}\n\nraw.scan(/<d:entry .*? id=\"(.*?)\" d:title=\"(.*?)\" class=\"entry\">/).each do |entry|\n   word_id_map[entry[1]] = entry[0]\nend\n\nmy_words.each do |word|\n  if id = word_id_map[word]\n    puts [id, word].join('  ')\n  end\nend\n\nWhen I replaced the original screensaver file with this new one, it worked. You can now have a \"Word of the Day\" screensaver that gives definitions for the words you choose.\n\nA: This should solve your problem:\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-expanding-apple-dictionary-–-mac-only/\n", "Q: What is the best torrent client for OSX? What is the best torrent client for OSX ?\nutorrent, Transmission, Vuze or .... \n?\n\nA: Transmission is light and captures the OS X essence. I have been using it for years with no issues. Plus, it's free and open source.\n\nA: My vote goes to Deluge, used it for years on Linux and now on OSX. Choose it because it was similar to utorrent.\nIf you want minimal and effective go with Transmission.\nI used Vuze many years ago, it was named Azureus then, it was written in java and very slow and unresponsive, I believe that has changed now.\n", "Q: How can I disable password for system preferences lock? How can I permanently unlock all system preferences? Is there any way to disable the \"Click the lock to make changes\" needing a password, or is there a way to permanently unlock all settings in Mountain Lion?\nMore specifically I'm turning the Network Link Conditioner  ( to simulate slow connections ) on and off frequently from its system preferences pane and it needs a password each time and it's getting annoying.\nI'm comfortable with the security issues this presents if I could revert to the default behavior at some point. \nEdit \nI'd just like to point out that in the time it takes to think up a sarcastic reply to an answer ( but ultimately not send because you're too polite ), the lock locks itself automatically.\n\nA: The settings stay unlocked, just do not click the \"lock\". This will keep the stuff unlocked until you want to lock it again.\n\nA: The inverse version of the answer on how to enable the lock:\nGo to Security & Privacy, then Advanced.\nuncheck the box for Require an administrator password to access system-wide preferences\nThat should ensure all the lockable prefs default to unlocked.\n", "Q: Update Xcode from 4.6.1 to 4.6.3 for Homebrew I have installed Xode downloading the DMG (not from the Mac App Store).

This question is directly relevant to my failing attempts to upgrade the RAM in a Late 2009 White Unibody MacBook (MacBook6,1) to 8GB, and the question may be better asked in that context.\nIt is widely referenced (most authoritatively on everymac.com) that this model can support 8GB (despite Apple saying the max is 4GB), but in the \"System Information: Hardware Overview\" screenshots of every successful upgrade, the Boot ROM Version is shown as MB61.00C8.B02 while mine is at MB61.00C8.B00. While it's possible that I got bad RAM, I'm wondering if the earlier firmware version doesn't support 8GB. I did find one other person on a forum with the B00 firmware having the same problem I am (\"3 beeps and won't boot with the RAM installed\"), but no resolution; he did RMA his RAM at least once. \nApple doesn't show any firmware updates at all for the MacBook6,1 model, so there's nothing official for me to try and re-flash. \nHas anyone managed to get 8GB working under B00, or upgrade it to B02?\n\nA: My 6,1 B02 has 8G RAM and works fine.  It also runs in 64 bit mode, which I enabled some time ago with the help of a simple hack (can't remember all the details, just google macbook, 64-bit, boot.efi, boot64.efi).\nYou could try to manually upgrade your firmware with the fw-upgrade of the macbook pro 5,5.  It has been done successfully by several people:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-release-notes/+bug/774089/comments/110\nBTW: By doing this, you will probably also fix the MCP79 bug that makes MCP79 negotiate SATA1 with newer SATA3 drives (instead of SATA2).\nSystem Profiler:\n\nNote, that with 8G RAM, hibernation (\"safe sleep\"?) will make WindowServer crash if you're still running 10.6 (Snow Leopard).\n\nA: How to install the firmware from a MacBook Pro \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.26 13\" onto a MacBook \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.26 13\" (Uni/Late 09) [Action should correct SATA speed issues and maybe RAM issues]:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a clean install of Yosemite (this should be optional, but it never hurts to start clean)\n\n*Download http://support.apple.com/kb/DL853 (MacBook Pro EFI Firmware Update 1.7)\n\n*Install Pacifist: https://www.charlessoft.com/ (or whatever software you like using to extract files)\n\n*Open Pacifist and then drag the MacBookProEFIUpdate.dmg into it\n\n*Expand: Contents of MacBookProEFIUpdate.pkg -> Contents of MacBookProEFIUpdate.pkg -> Applications -> Utilities -> MacBook Pro EFI Firmware Update.app -> Contents -> Resources\n\n*Drag MBP55_00AC_03B_LOCKED.scap to the Desktop\n\n*Click the Extract button in Pacifist and enter your password if prompted and press OK (might need to enter your password twice)\n\n*Quit Pacifist\n\n*Click Go -> Utilities\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type \"cd Desktop\" without the quotes and press Enter/Return\n\n*Type \"mv MBP55_00AC_03B_LOCKED.scap MB61_00C8_B02_LOCKED.scap\" without the quotes and press Enter/Return\n\n*Make sure your laptop is hooked up to a reliable power source\n\n*Type \"sudo bless -mount / -firmware MB61_00C8_B02_LOCKED.scap --recovery --verbose\" without the quotes and press Enter/Return\n\n*Type your password and press Enter/Return\n\n*Restart your Mac (you should hear an angry beep, then see a black screen like nothing is happening for a good while, then a gray screen with a progress bar, and finally the Mac will reboot again)\n\n*Once your Mac has booted, open your System Report and verify the update was successful (Should show the Model Identifier as a MacBookPro5,5)\n\n*Have a drink!\n\n", "Q: precaution or steps to take before booting up 4 months unused macbook air My mother was ill for quite some-time, and she didn't use her MacBook Air for almost 4 months now.\nBefore booting it up again, and start making use, please let me know if there are some necessary steps (or checks) needs to be performed.\nFor example: Should I fulling charge it, and then boot-up OR should I just plug-in to charge and boot-it up\nwhat else should I check?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the lid and press the power button.\n\n*If it doesn't boot, plug it in to power and watch for the charge light to go from green to orange. (you don't need to wait and watch this, but this will tell you how the SMC and charge circuitry is working)\n\n*Press the power button\n\n\nThere should be no problems. The only thing that could suffer is the battery, Li-Ion batteries lose power and if they lose a lot of power, they can't be charged anymore with original charger. Charging while first boot or fully charging and then booting should not make any difference.\nOnce you've done this, you'll know if the Mac is working or perhaps needs more troubleshooting.\n\nA: The MacBook charger is sufficiently powerful to power the machine and charge the battery simultaneously, so the only thing I'd suggest for you to do is to cycle the battery once or twice and just proceed with regular use. So long as the MacBook was stored in a dry, safe place, there isn't any need to run hardware tests, as nothing would have magically broken itself from lack of use.\n", "Q: Dropbox + Mac Mini Server = Syncing Issues In our office, we use Dropbox business as a cloud; All of our files exist on a Mac Mini Server we use inside the office as a local repository for all of our Dropbox files.

In short, I have an audio file that is too large for iTunes Match (This item is not eligible for iCloud), but I'd still like to listen to it on my phone. In days past I was still able to drag the track to my iPhone in the sidebar, but that feature now seems to be disabled. \n\n\nA: I made the file kind \"audiobook,\" and then they seemed to sync fine, as audiobooks. Since they were lecture files, that's just fine with me. \n\nA: Just spoke to Sr. Apple Support staff.  There is no official way to do this without turning off iTunes Match, selecting the content you want moved to either the iPhone or the iPad (in iTunes), syncing and then turning iTunes Match back on.  While not a great solution, that is the official word.\n\nA: I changed the file type to 'Audiobook', (Right click on the file in iTunes, Get Info, Options, then change 'media kind' to audiobook') and then it allowed me to drag and drop the file on to my iPhone in iTunes.\nThen, in the Music app on the iPhone, tap 'More' in the bottom right corner, and 'audiobooks' will appear in the list.\nTook about an hour of faffing about with iTunes Match before I discovered this tip. Then it was done in about 20 seconds.\n\nA: As a possible workaround you could use a different app than the default Music.app for this particular song. Some apps (Azul, for example) permit you to use simple iTunes sharing to put media inside and they are independent of the iTunes library.\nIt is not ideal but it does solve the problem.\n\nA: I have found to date the best fix to this dilemma is to change the \"Media Kind\" to iTunes U. Select the track or tracks and then select options, you will see the option to change the media type. This option will be available to only songs that have Not been added from your mac or pc to iCloud i.e. there's the cloud with a line through it next to the track. I have the latest iTunes 11.1.1 and iOS 7 on my iPhone. I used this method to add 323 teaching files  that won't sync to the cloud, not sure why because I have other teaching files that are the same length and they sync to the cloud just fine. Turning iTunes match off then moving the files to my phone, then turning iTunes Match back on didn't work, it just erased the files i just moved over when turning match back on.\n\nA: I had the same issue. My solution was to go onto my iPhone 5S, turn OFF iTunes Match in settings. At the same time, I also turned on Automatic Downloads Music. One of these solved my problem. When I plugged my phone back into the computer, all of my music synced. Good luck. \n\nA: I had great success with going into iTunes and selecting Get Info → Options and changing the type from Music to Audiobook and selecting the checkboxes for Do Not Shuffle and Remember Location.\nThen you can selective-sync audiobooks with your iPhone and sync like in the old days.\n", "Q: How can I set the default Reminders list on Mountain Lion? I'm using Mountain Lion and defined a service to add a reminder. My problem: It adds it in the wrong Reminders list. I can find a preference anywhere to set the default Reminders list - Reminders (doesn't have preferences), Calendar, System Preferences. I must have set it under Lion to one list, but now I want to changed it.\nThe most common suggestion was that it's the list at the top of the \"list list\" - but that doesn't work for me. \nSo how do I change the default Reminders list in Mountain Lion?\n\nA: As it turned out, I defined the Reminders list in the Automator service myself, so I could change it there. Stupid me!\n", "Q: How do I see all iOS in-app subscriptions that I have active? If I subscribe to several iOS in-app subscriptions, such as magazine app subscriptions on my iPad, then how can I later show a list of all my in-app subscriptions? \n\nA: This article by Federico Viticci on Mac Stories gives a detailed description of how iTunes subscriptions work. In particular, he provides a link to a page to manage subscriptions which you can open on an iPad (and presumably an iPhone or iPod touch):\n\nAs soon as I subscribed to The Daily, Apple sent me an email to confirm the Weekly Subscription.\nI clicked on the link provided in the email, which looks something like this.\n\nThis page allows you to see all of your existing subscriptions, as well as to manage or unsubscribe from them.\nIt’s worth noting, however, that the article in question was written almost two years ago (February 2011). He states:\n\nThe browser tried to launch iTunes on my Mac, but iTunes returned the following error:\nSubscription management: Please use your iPad to Manage your Subscriptions\nApparently, Apple’s current implementation of subscriptions can be managed only on the iPad.\n\nSince then, this issue has been closed. Clicking the link on a Mac now takes you to a page to manage your subscription in iTunes, in addition to using an iOS device.\n", "Q: Is there a way to configure OSX to auto mount and SMB share without entering a user and password into the configuration file? I've found instructions on how to auto mount an SMB share, but they either involve adding the share to the login items (I'm using a laptop and that gives me an error when I'm not in the same network as the SMB share), or adding my login and password into the fstab or auto_master file (if I change my password, as I should, I have to go reconfiguring the system).\nMy user and password are stored in the keychain, and I only want the system to mount the share when I'm in the same network. I'm lazy and I want this to happen automatically. Is it possible?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible, but you'll either need an non-lazy friend or put in the work yourself in order to set it up.\nFirst thing I thought of was creating a shell script that monitors your networks connection details and executes the appropriate autologin and automount commands when it sees that you are connecting to the right network.\nSo, to answer your original question, yes it is possible.\n", "Q: How to download videos from iTunes? I wanted to download these Stanford and MIT lectures. Unfortunately, they are all privatized by iMac. Do you see that all download links bring to itunes.com site?

All it does is play online.\nHere is how the iTunes download page looks like \nYou may enjoy the DPI-aware perfect Mac interface. But, where is the \"Download\" button?\n\nA: If you want to stay up with the entire course, press the large subscribe button and you will then get a warning that explains a bit more about how the process works.\n\nAt that point, you can double check what content you want to actually download (just like a podcast works) and you will of course have to enter an AppleID with payment set up if the specific course you have chosen requires such for some or all of the materials.\nYou can also press the free buttons along the right to download individual lessons to your computer (or iOS device) for offline viewing.\n", "Q: After booting correctly, why at some point would function keys get remapped in Macbook Air? I have a mid-2011 Macbook Air. Sometime in the recent past, the Function key row (which I used for volume control, brightness control, keyboard backlight control, etc) has stopped working. \nBy stopped working, I mean it seems like those keys have been remapped. For example, the \"increase volume\" function key shows the widget screen (with the clock, calculator, etc). Another function key shows the app dashboard.\nI fiddled around with all the available keyboard settings in \"System Preferences\" but got nowhere.\nOnce, after a reboot, the function key functionality was reinstated, but all too briefly. After a few hours, the errant behavior has resumed.\nAny pointers or ideas?\n\nA: Without knowing what programs you have installed that could be doing that:\nLike some keyboard remapper...\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in as different user to make sure there is not something in you profile preferences\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*Start in Safe mode to exclude other applications. \n\n\nThen start applications one by one to find out who is doing it.\nAlso check this setting in System preference keyboard:\n", "Q: How can I restore the default dimensions of the Force Quit dialog I accidentally maximized the Force Quit dialoge on my Mac and I am looking for a way to restore it to its original size other than manually resizing it.

Is there a tool that I can just run for a day, and then look at the statistics it produces to identify the performance bottleneck?\nI am considering either buying more RAM (I have 8 currently, would get 16) or an SSD (I currently have the stock HDD).\n\nA: The tools I would use are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activity Monitor\n\n*Instruments (run from Xcode)\n\n*vm_stat 900 \n\n*io_stat 900\n\n*top -u -s 900\n\n*sysdiagnose - shift+control+option+command+. (or run sudo sysdiagnose)\n\n\nThe two stat commands and top all run in a terminal window and snapshot 15 minute intervals of activity. The stat ones log the statistics. I'd run the sysdiagnose command sparingly, perhaps once at the start of the period, once when the OS seems exceptionally slow and once at the end.\nThe easiest to manage is Activity monitor and I'd focus on making sure nothing is occupying the CPU that you don't feel should be taking a lot of resources and the balance of RAM - what percentage is wired what percentage is wired+active.\n\nA: The bottleneck of your system is HIGHLY specific to the application of your Mac. Here are some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*A video game rig is almost always bottled necked by the graphics\ncard, as video games don't require much disk access or CPU computing.\n\n*Casual use, like loading applications and files, is likely\nbottlenecked by file access speed.\n\n*Development and A/V production requires a mix of most computer specifications, but there isn't an \"automatic\" application to determine it for you.\nHere is how I would determine the bottleneck:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a look at your RAM usage. A nice free way to do so is opening Activity Monitor, right clicking the dock icon, and selecting \"Show Memory Usage\" under the \"Dock Icon\" sub-menu. If your RAM (excluding \"inactive\" memory) is frequently high (for example, 80%), then perhaps it'd be worth upgrading. If you only ever used half of your 8GB of RAM, adding on 8 more GB wouldn't impact performance.\n\n*Similarly, keep an eye on your disk activity (from activity monitor). Benchmark your Mac's HDD (so you learn it's Read/Write max speeds) and compare the disk activity you observe to the maximum capability of the drive. If you frequently hit the max, then perhaps it's SSD upgrade time.\n\n\nI would recommend the SSD upgrade. Apart from the obvious file I/O speed boost, if you use too much memory, your SSD would make for much better swap space than your current HDD.\n", "Q: How do I change my MacBook FaceTime cell phone number? I have a new cell phone number, and, as my FaceTime on my MacBook still has the old number, and so does my iMessage, I'd like to change it. How can I do it?\nApparently, the only option given, under FaceTime's preferences, is to add another email \n\nA: You can change the phone number associated with your appleid on http://appleid.apple.com \nI know that when you update mail addresses there they also update your facetime account, I suppose it should be the same for telephone numbers.\n\nA: Un-check send and receive as that number in Messages and FaceTime and your MacBook will no longer receive or send messages that deliver to that phone number.\nOnce you've released that number from all devices that connect to your Apple ID, you can clear things from https://appleid.apple.com or if necessary working with Apple Support.\n\nA: *\n\n*Close FaceTime on the iMac.\n\n*Open Settings/FaceTime on your iPhone.\n\n*select \"iPhone Cellular Calls\" on.\n\n\nYou'll be asked to sign in to your Apple id account. Once you have set up this up on your phone then restart FaceTime on iMac, go to preferences and you should see you new number.\nHope that helps! \n\nA: You can go to FaceTime preferences and you can choose which email or number and/or add another email or number. iMessage is the same way.\n\nA: I had the same issue, and after looking everywhere, I went to my service provider (in Colombia) and the solution was really simple, but not obvious at all.\nFirst, let me explain how the services work here. We have something called “closed plans” and “opened plans”. With the closed plans, you pay a fixed and monthly amount of money for your service, with the opened, you have a monthly fee aswell, but you are allowed to exeed your fee in case your minutes or basic plan is exceeded, opposed to the closed plan.\nSo, it seems that in order to verify your phone number, Apple charges a little amount of money to your account, like 10 cents or something. So, if your plan is opened, you have no problem, but (like in my case) if your plan is closed, Apple is unable to verify your number.\nIn my case, I'm able to charge to my plan something like 30 cents and voila! the number was verified and everything was normal again. The costumer service guy told me that everytime I travel to another country and came back again, just have to make sure that I have some money in my plan to Apple be able to verify my number. I know that it sounds weird or something, but after trying everything (even restore my phone and change the SIM card), this was the only solution.\nNow, I don't know how things work with your service provider, but in my case, it worked!\n", "Q: \"Not Enough Storage\" message preventing me from using iphone 4S I am using an iPhone 4S. This morning, the \"Not Enough Storage\" message popped up on my screen and refused to go away. This means that while I can open apps using siri, the message \"blocks\" me from using the touchscreen. So I can't even switch the phone off to reset it as I cannot slide the power bar off. \nAnother way to switch the phone off will be to just let the battery drain but at 85% charge, it is going to take a long time! Anyone knows how I can get rid of this message that will not go away? \n\nA: Hold the home button and power button at the same time until the phone restarts. Connect it to your computer and delete some stuff :D\n\nA: Hold the home button and the lock screen button at the same time until the phone shuts down.  It will then reboot.\n", "Q: Safari clear cache on quit Is there any way of convincing Safari to clear the cache when it quits? If not from Safari's options, then maybe an extension that does this?\nI would use private browsing instead, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to work well for me (some sites say they can't use cookies, and a lot of functionality is broken with this enabled).\n\nA: The menubar app Cookie can clear exactly what you want to clear at quit, at timed intervals, or both.\nCan also clear thosenefarious Tracking Cookies, as well as non-favorite cookies, Flash and other databases -- and do this for all your browsers.\nNot part of the company--just think especially with Tracking, it's a must have.

I use the standard settings given by the configuration wizard in OSX Mountain Lion. \nThe problem I am facing is that mail.app removes all incoming emails from the inbox. I can only find the emails in the folder All Mail. This happens in mail.app and in GMail (accessed through webmail), as well. The problem must be caused by mail.app, because it resolves when I removed my the GMail account from mail.app.\nIs there a way to debug this problem? Any way I can see what instructions mail.app is sending to GMail through IMAP?    \n\nA: Debugging Mail.app on OS X is fairly easy - especially in the case you describe where the problem is with one account.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the Incoming Mail server name from preferences (Mail --> Preferences... --> Accounts --> (your account) --> Incoming Mail Server) - it's likely something like mail.gmail.com or imap.gmail.com\n\n*Quit Mail\n\n*Open terminal and type this all as one long line (it's split here for readability):\n/Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail -LogActivityOnHost imap.gmail.com -LogIMAPErrors YES >& ~/Desktop/MailConnection.log &\nThe harder part becomes making sense of the volume of data being logged, but again it seems you have a good handle on the scope of the issue. I would take a gander at your IMAP and label settings in gmail preferences to be sure your account isn't suppressing those folders for IMAP delivery.\n", "Q: Flash storage best for running bootcamp? I am going to buy an imac and will use windows via bootcamp a lot of the time. I was wondering if installing the windows partition on flash storage is possible at all and if so if it will make windows work much faster in the same way it makes OS X faster. I could not find an answer to this question anywhere else. Thank you.\n\nA: If you have enough space on your SSD go for it.\nIf you have Fusion drive and enough space for both systems, Mac allows two partitions on the flash part and one can be used for Windows with bootcamp. Go for it.\nAnyway, OS in flash storage is a great improvement, OS type does not matter, they all acquire great speed boost.\nYou can find additional info here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5446?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US .\n", "Q: Keynote and Recorded Presentations If you \"Record Slideshow\" in Keynote then it'll listen to your computer's microphone and make well-sync'd presentation you can save to .mov and share, but it's pretty damned big, even for a short presentation.\nIs there any way to export only the audio and the slide timing info from Keynote once your recording has been made?\nThe options I can see are iPod, HTML, Images, PDF, PPT and Quicktime. With a bit of faff I can extract the audio from the Quicktime, but I'll have lost the timing info.\nIdeally I'd be able to export \"Images with Timing info\" which would give me the images and a file of timestamps linked to filenames which I could use to pair the two up.\nDoes such a thing exist?\n\nA: Since keynote files are just zip archives with XML documents and assets stored in a fairly obvious folder structure, I'd start with moving your Keynote into a folder with nothing else and use the terminal unzip command to extract everything.\nThe index.apxl file will have your timing information stored in plain text and encoded as XML - so you might be able to parse that with an XML tool or otherwise extract your timing.\nI don't think the file is documented publicly other than the various public namespace declarations in the header of the file, but it's a start to cracking your timeline problem if you don't mind spelunking in XML and reverse engineering the commands recorded within the file.\n", "Q: How can I make my computer believe a disk image is a hardware disk? I'm trying to do some research on TimeMachine right now. I don't want to purchase an external hard drive, just to learn about some software, and so I'd like to be able to tinker with the settings, by just creating a disk image...\nBut when I mount the disk image, TimeMachine doesn't see it as something it can back up to. So I'm wondering how I can lie to the system, and make it believe that the image is in fact real.\nThanks!\n\nA: Aloha, counterbeing - I think we've worked together before!\nI like the previous answer that creates a partition, but if that doesn't work for you, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your Disk Image (I've used a sparse bundle disk image).\n\n*Mount the disk image\n\n*From the command line, enter the following:\n\n\nsudo tmutil setdestination /Volumes/{mounted-image-name}\n• Start Time Machine manually within the menu bar via \"Back Up Now\"\nIf all goes well, you should then back up to the image. It will need to be large enough to contain all of your backup data - or Time Machine will likely refuse to use it.\n\nA: I don't know of a way to do this, but if you have enough space left on your drive, you could add a small, temporary partition instead of using a disk image. This creates a real partition, and can be done without erasing current partitions by resizing them.\nNote: If you are partitioning your boot drive, you may need to run Disk Utility from either your install disk or the recovery partition for some versions of OS X. At least 10.8.3 allows you to do it directly, though.\nFirst, open Disk Utility from the /Applications/Utilities folder and click on your hard drive in the sidebar (the disk, not the partition). Then, go to the Partition tab and click the + button. Click the new partition and enter an appropriate size and optionally rename it using the fields on the right. Then press the Apply button and wait.\nWhen you are done testing with your partition, you can remove it by clicking on it in the Partition tab and pressing the - button. Then, drag the bottom of the other partition down so that it fills the free space left behind and press Apply.\n", "Q: Using a Macbook Pro alongside an iMac If I have a 27\" iMac, I understand I can use the display as an external monitor for my Macbook Pro. Presumably I can use the bluetooth keyboard as well as an external input?\nCan you still run the iMac (and maybe instantly switch between them?). e.g. if I'm working on the Macbook using the iMac as a display, can I still listen to music on the iTunes library that's on my iMac, or switch to it to read a file (or download something from iTunes etc)?\n\nA: Using your mac in target display mode would waste it's potential as a more power computer than your MacBook. Try an app like Teleport. It lets you network your multiple Macs together so that a host Mac's mouse and keyboard can be used to control other Macs. It works very similarly to multiple displays on a single machine, and even the clip board is shared between the two! The only issue is that you can't drag windows between the two displays (which are actually running on two separate computers), but at least both Mac's power can be used.\n\nA: chLook up Target Display Mode under the Finder help menu. You can easily switch back and forth, and your iMac's apps (iTunes) will continue to run even when not visible: \n\nAfter you connect the computers, the external display Mac acts like\n  any other external display. Apps that were open on the external\n  display Mac remain open even though you can’t see their windows. To\n  change display settings, choose Apple menu > System Preferences, and\n  then click Displays on the primary computer.\n\nYou'll need the appropriate cable (Thunderbolt or Mini DisplayPort).

You may want to search around for people who repair Apple laptop repair, as they are likely to be able to refer you to someone local.\n\nA: If the cracked area is small, you can keep using it with a screen protector on the screen.

On my MacBook Air 2013 (Mountain Lion):\npmset has the following sleep settings:\n$ pmset -g\n...\n disksleep            10\n sleep                1\n displaysleep         2\n\nwhile systemsetup has the following settings:\n$ systemsetup -getsleep\nSleep: Computer sleeps after 10 minutes\nSleep: Display sleeps after 10 minutes\nSleep: Disk sleeps after 10 minutes\n\nWhat is the difference between these settings?\nAlso, Energy Saver shows \"Display sleep\" is set to 2 minutes, so coincides with pmset, while \"Computer sleep\" is no longer shown in Mountain Lion I have read. Why is this no longer possible?\nUPDATE: Turns out MacBook Air 2013 dropped separate sliders for computer- and display sleep: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1595455\nUsing pmset to set these individually should still work however. Not sure I like the change though...\n\nA: In this case, systemsetup is a high level wrapper that is analogous to the System Preferences UI. Both call the lower level power API which are the internals about how the system actually stores these values for the hardware to use and implement. pmset is a lower level tool that reads the API/hardware values directly, so I would generally trust that over the higher level tools like Energy Saver or system setup\nIf you are right and there is a discrepancy, you might have to file a bug report with Apple to figure out if it's really a bug or just that the information is being mixed up before it is presented to you.\nYou can go directly to the source file as it's stored at /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist and perhaps it can break the tie between which of these three tools is telling you the correct information?\nIn all my computers, the numbers match up, so perhaps the systemsleep values are incorrect for your hardware or OS build? \n\nA: After doing some more testing, it seems the results from systemsetup -getsleep correlate with the Power Adapter settings on the Energy Adapter prefpane. When I use -setsleep 10, the Display Sleep timer also jumps to 10 minutes, and vice versa.\nAlso, when I check Prevent computer from sleeping when display is off, systemsetup -getsleep returns Sleep: Computer sleeps Never, while unchecking Put hard disks to sleep when possible causes Sleep: Disk sleeps Never.\nIn conclusion, it would seem the reason for the deviating values of pmset and systemsetup is that I was testing while on battery power, so pmset returned battery values, while systemsetup always returns power adapter values.\n\nA: My MacBook Air is an Early 2015 model and installed with macOS 10.14.2, and I've encounter the similar issue.\nIt puzzled me at first, but after poking-around for a while, I found:\n\n\n*\n\n*pmset is able to set different sleep configuration for battery mode and AC mode, with -b and -c options respectively. What info pmset -g displays depends on whether the your MAC is using battery or AC power. So, if you want to know the complete settings pmset currently holds, you should run pmset -g twice, with and without power adapter plugged on respectively.\n\n*systemsetup has no options to distinguish battery and AC power setting.\n\n*If you use systemsetup to change the power settings, the settings in GUI System Preference==>Energy Saver==>Power Adapter changes accordingly, and vice versa. But, the settings in System Preference==>Energy Saver==>Battery always stay the same after using systemsetup. So, it is obvious that systemsetup can only modify AC-mode power settings.\n", "Q: Win 7 size within VMWare I use VMWare with a Win 7 virtual machine.\nI have a late 2012 iMac with 20GB of RAM.

The 2012 iMac CPU is quite capable and you do have significant amounts of RAM so you could juice the VM to a lot more RAM if needed without starving OS X for memory.\n", "Q: Restore from \"iOS7 backup\" to an iOS6 phone A friend upgraded my device to iOS7. It didn't work properly so I downgraded it a few days later to iOS6.\nI have backups both in iCloud and on OS X (iTunes). When I try to restore either I get a message:\n\nTo restore this iPhone from this backup, you must first set up the\n  iPhone as new and restore the software to the latest version.\n\nWithout this backup I am very inconvenienced, so I ask is it possible to restore an iPhone from a iOS7 Backup if you downgraded the phone to iOS6? \n\nA: You can edit the info.plist file. I successfully restored my backup to 6.1.4. Edit the build version to your ipsw's build version and product version to the version you want to downgrade to. Using plist editors in windows are highly recommended.\nWindows: C:\\Users[Your username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup[Your UDID]\nMac: ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/[Your UDID]/\nAfter that just restore the backup normally. If an error popped up at the end, ignore it. Hope this helps.\n\nA: In general, you can never restore a backup from a newer version of iOS to an older version of iOS.\n\nSo - you can't load 6.1.2 backup on 6.1.1 or 6.1 or 6.0 or 5.x (etc…)\nWe're not a good place to ask specifically about iOS 7 until it's released to the general public, but this is known to not work for any OS categorically whether your backup is from a current, past or beta(future) iOS release.\nYou'll need to either run the OS needed for a particular backup or find an older backup or start over with syncing content to a freshly erased device.\n\nNow, in iTunes open preferences and devices and look to see if you have more than one backup for that device. Also, when you restore from iOS - it shows you the latest backup from that device by default - but you can also tap a button to show other backups in case you have other devices or other backups that are older than the most recent backup. I hope you can find a backup here or perhaps restoring the backup folder on OS X by using Time Machine to restore an older version of the folder ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\n\nA: I had the exact same problem! I have an iPhone 4, so IOS 7 doesn't work very fast.\nThe only thing I really needed back were my contacts, so I extracted the contacts from the iPhone back files. Once extracted, I downgraded to IOS 6 and used an iPhone transfer application to put the contacts back in. Check Google for iPhone transfer application.\nDownload the extractor from here: http://www.winavi.com/iphone-data-recovery/index.htm\n\nA: I don’t think so. Both should allow you to do a complete restore. Obviously the backup is not everything — your synced items (music, apps, videos, etc) are not included in a backup because they are restored by re-syncing. So an iCloud backup and restore wouldn’t give you back your synced items until you sync again. Never tried it, though.\n", "Q: How do I have Safari 6 ask before quitting (to avoid accidental quits)? Safari used to have a preference option to confirm before quitting, now that has disappeared.  It's so easy to quit accidentally and lose all your tabs.  I know you can resume or re-open the previous session, but those are not solutions to the problem.\nHow do I make Safari ask me before quitting?\n\nA: The setting was called \"Confirm before closing multiple tabs or windows\", but it was removed in 10.7 when Resume was introduced. defaults write com.apple.Safari ConfirmClosingMultiplePages -bool true doesn't work anymore either.\nThe part of Resume where application state is kept after quitting was disabled by default in 10.8, but you can reenable it from the General preference pane:\n\nYou can also enable it in just Safari by running defaults write com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool true and quitting and reopening Safari.\nSafari will still reload tabs when they are restored. And restoring state has only worked about half of the time for me since Safari 6 or 10.8.\nYou might also change the shortcut for quitting Safari:\n\nOr disable some of the shortcuts completely:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict 'Quit Safari' '\\0' 'Close Window' '\\0' 'Close All Windows' '\\0'\n\nA: In the History menu, you have the new option to \"Restore last window closed\" on top of the previously existing \"Restore all windows from previous session\".\n\nA: The fact that Safari doesn't \"ask\" before closing when multiple tabs exist:\n1. Not \"asking\" is a nuisance.  My spouse, who is not too tech davy, never seems to notice that there are multiple tabs open.  She just clicks the close button, generally intending to close only the active tab.\n2. Even when there is just one tab in use, it should be possible to close using the little gray x in the tab as is done for each tab when there is more than one.  That would make things self-consistant. One then could close tabs, one by one, including the last one which would result in the whole window being closed (the same as when the red x is clicked).\n3. For those who don't like to receive a warning, let them have a way within Safari Preferences to opt out.  But the default should be to warn.\nMaking things self-consistant is the most compelling of all reasons.  It's good design practice, folks.\n", "Q: How to speed up reading Blu-ray images? I have unencrypted .iso images of both DVD and BD (don't know how to check the UDF version used). When mounting and copying files off them, BD is around four times slower. Why? How do I speed it up?\n\nA: The easiest solution to reach Blu-ray or DVD ISO on Mac is to digitize ISO image to readable file type for iMac, this is my suggestion. \n", "Q: Can Time Machine be used as a Drobo system I came across some products by Drobo that let you use an array of external hard drives seamlessly. Would Time Machine be able to do something similar?  \nFor example, suppose I have HD1 with photos and connect HD2 (empty). Will Time Machine replicate some of HD1 data into HD2? If not, what is a reasonably cheap alternative to Drobo?\n\nA: Time Machine just takes all the volumes mounted and copies them all to one destination volume. On Mountain Lion, you can have multiple destinations, but they get written to in round robin style (so any one backup set goes to one drive as opposed to mirroring the data on all destination volumes).\nDrobo functions as a RAID - redundant array of independent disks - and OS X supports software RAID so you could combine several physical drives into one logical drive. The traditional RAID doesn't expand or shrink on the fly like Drobo does, but it also doesn't have some of the downsides of Drobo's implementation as well.\n", "Q: How can I run Warcraft 3 on my new MacBook Pro I recently bought the digital copies of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne from the blizzard store. They are registered with my blizzard account but when I download the zip file it opens a downloader but my computer says it can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. What can I do about this? \nThe error is shown in this image\n\n\nA: From https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/playing-older-blizzard-titles-on-mac-os-x-10-7-lion : \n\nWarcraft III will only run on Mac OS X 10.7 if your operating system\n  was upgraded from 10.6.X and only if the Warcraft III installation was\n  patched before the operating system was upgraded. There is currently\n  no way to install or patch the game on Lion.\n\nSo you need a 10.6 system to bootstrap from.\n\nA: What this error box shows is the Gatekeeper functionality that notes if an application has not been signed by a developer registered with Apple.\nIt prevents people from accidentally running apps that are unsigned.\nYou can make this and only this application run by bypassing this gatekeeper check by opening  a Finder window showing the file and right click on the file and select open, you will then get a dialog box similar to the one you have which will also have an OK button allowing you to open the application.\nYou can also relax the settings in System Preferences to stop this check happening and allow any application to run (unlock and select the button named Anywhere and run all the unsigned apps you want to trust and then revert the settings to more secure)\n\n\nHowever from other answers this might only get you a bit further as this does not deal with Rosetta/PowerPC issues.\n", "Q: terminal app on my iphone 5? Which app do i use to get terminal on my iphone 5? \nI got something that i thought was terminal, but im not sure. I want to modify my iphone using terminal. \nI downloaded serverauditor already.\nPlease help. \n\nA: Local\nTo use a local terminal, you have to jailbreak.\nAt which point you would install mobileterminal(with cydia) to access the local shell.\nRemote\nFor accessing other systems, you would need a ssh client (although you could do the above, and run ssh).\nI recommend prompt.\nAlso, if you jailbroke your iPhone and installed openssh, you could just use prompt to connect locally; it has a better interface than mobileterminal.\n", "Q: Wake Other Computers from Mac OSX Is there a terminal command within Mac OSX that will allow me to use WOL (Wake On LAN) to wake up other computers? Windows has wolcmd, is there an equivalent within OSX?\nI am trying to wake a computer from my rMBP, within my network. My rMBP is connected via WiFi normally, but can also be connected via Thunderbolt GbE connector. The target computer is a Windows machine that I want to wake up before I connect to it using a remote desktop connection.\n\nA: Install the wakeonlan package using Homebrew:\n$ brew install wakeonlan\n(It's a Perl script for waking up computers via Wake-On-LAN magic packets.)\nWhen installed, you can send a \"magic packet\" from your Terminal to any device using its IP (Internet Protocol) and MAC (Media Access Control) address.\nHere's an example of a typical use:\n$ wakeonlan -i 192.168.1.255 -p 1234 01:02:03:04:05:06\nThe scripts takes 2 arguments, the MAC address of the NIC, and an IP address.\n\nNote: The IP address argument is tricky and isn't what you'd think.\nFor a NIC on your local subnet, use the broadcast-address of this subnet. (e.g. subnet 192.168.10.0 with netmask 255.255.255.0, use 192.168.10.255)\n\nFor example, I have a Synology NAS manually configured with the IP address of 10.0.1.100 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and a router address of 10.0.1.1.\nThe correct IP address to use is not that of the device, but instead the broadcast-address of the subnet.\nContinuing on my example, I used the following command to successfully wake up my Synology:\n$ wakeonlan -i 10.0.1.255 -p 7 01:02:03:04:05:06\n(Naturally, substitute the actual values of your device and network for your situation.)\nYou can get more information from the wakeonlan man page, man wakeonlan, or a quick glossary of commands from wakeonlan -h.\n\nA: The wakeonlan command for command-line can be added to OS X using the homebrew package manager.\n\nA: wolcmd is available for Mac: http://www.depicus.com/wake-on-lan/wake-on-lan-for-apple-mac.aspx\nGUI version for $1.99, terminal version is free. Usage is just the same as its Windows counterpart.\n\nA: The RubyGems package which is stock on Mac, can also be used to install a wake on lan app.  Just use the gem install wol command in terminal.  It will install the activity in /usr/bin/local/wol.\nThis avoids having to install brew or package managers.  It accepts the same arguments as the wakeonlan examples above.  \nAs an aside, the wol tool can wake a properly configured Synology NAS.\n\nA: Python comes with OS X per default. So you could use this small Python 2 script to send the wake on lan package. Save it as wakeonlan.py or something you like:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport socket\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) < 3:\n    print \"Usage: wakeonlan.py <ADR> <MAC>     (example: 192.168.1.255 00:11:22:33:44:55)\"\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nmac = sys.argv[2]\ndata = ''.join(['FF' * 6, mac.replace(':', '') * 16])\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\nsock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)\nsock.sendto(data.decode(\"hex\"), (sys.argv[1], 9))\n\nUse it like this:\npython wake.py 192.168.1.255 00:11:22:33:44:55\n\nModify the IP address and MAC address accordingly. The IP address should be the broadcast address of the network.\nFor easy access you could make this script executable and add it to some directory in your path.\n\nA: It's probably possible to be installed through the MacPorts package manager as well, but I don't have it installed, can't test it.\n\nA: Apologies: can't upvote \"@J. P. Petersen\" or comment yet (don't have enough points), so an answer (late) will have to do.\n@lacy is correct on Python3 now, but the script did need some mod, so here's what worked for me (since .decode no longer python3, and we need the MAC address to be bytes-like; also note simplified code and MAC address first argument, no colons); same use broadcast address (not IP address):\n$ pico wakeonlan3.py\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport socket\nimport sys\nmac = bytes(sys.argv[1], 'utf-8')\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\nsock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)\nsock.sendto(mac, (sys.argv[2], 9))\n\n$ chmod 775 wakeonlan3.py\n$ python3 wakeonlan3.py 001451e6f3d1 192.168.0.255\n\nA: Here is a working python3 version of @J.P. Petersen's solution, you need to replace the hex-decode component, e.g. with the solution mentioned here: Decode Hex String in Python 3\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport socket\nimport sys\nimport codecs\n\nif len(sys.argv) < 3:\n    print(\"Usage: wakeonlan.py <ADR> <MAC>     (example: 192.168.1.255 00:11:22:33:44:55)\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nmac = sys.argv[2]\ndata = ''.join(['FF' * 6, mac.replace(':', '') * 16])\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\ndecode_hex = codecs.getdecoder(\"hex_codec\")\nsock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)\nsock.sendto(decode_hex(data)[0], (sys.argv[1], 9))\n\n", "Q: How Do I Disable Remote Management and Enable Screen Sharing? I am connected to a headless remote Mac Mini. Under Sharing in the System Preferences both Remote Login and Remote Management are checked though Remote Mangement is \"grayed out\". I would like to disable Remote Management and enable Screen Sharing.\nCurrently the Screen Sharing checkbox is \"grayed out\". When I click on it, I get the following message: \"Screen Sharing is currently being controlled by the Remote Management service.\" This warning to not continue makes sense if I would lose my current VNC connection and not be able to turn it back on remotely.\nTo access the remote server I Connect to Server (command-k) vnc://IPnumber\nI would like just Remote Login and Screen Sharing enabled and Remote Management disabled.\nDoes anyone know the steps for me to accomplish this goal remotely?\n\nA: I found the following code in a file I didn't open for a long time. It enables Remote Login on a remote device. Save the script somewhere (from now on referred to as /path/to/script/). Copy the script to the other device.\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to set current pane to pane \"com.apple.preferences.sharing\"\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    click checkbox 1 of row 6 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window \"Sharing\"\nend tell\n\nThis enables remote login. Now, to disable remote management and enable screen sharing, use the same script, but remove the 3rd line and add these 2 lines:\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to set current pane to pane \"com.apple.preferences.sharing\"\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    click checkbox 1 of row 7 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window \"Sharing\"\n    click checkbox 1 of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window \"Sharing\"\nend tell\n\nTo copy this script on the remote device, use scp (secure copy). To use scp type\nscp /path/to/script username@IP.of.other.device:/some/path\nOR\nscp username@hostnameOfDevice:/some/path/\nThe second option (using the device hostname) requires that the devices are on a computer-to-computer network, so it will not work on a normal wifi network. You will see a prompt requesting the password of username. When you type the password, you will not see any text appear (obviously to prevent people from seeing the password).  \nOnce it is copied, remotely log into the device:\nssh username@IP.of.other.device\nOR\nssh username@hostnameOfDevice\nAgain, the use of the hostname requires computer-to-computer network. Once logged in, run the script using osascript /some/path/theScript.scpt (remember that using scp we copied the script to /some/path, this will be different on your device). This will disable remote management and enable screen sharing.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Problem with permissions on my Lion Server I have noticed that the permissions for certain folders seem to be screwed up.\nWhen I look at the Get Info for the folder I see strange things in the permissions section.

I also tried to repair the permissions from the recovery partition but it will only let me repair the permissions on the system hard drive.\nHow can I reset the permissions to a standard value? Or can I repair permissions on the secondary hard drive as well?\nThanks\n\nA: First, as an FYI, you only need to boot into the recovery partition to repair permissions when you are trying to repair permissions on your computer's boot drive. To do it for any other drive, simple select it in Disk Utility and click the Repair Disk Permissions button. This may solve your problem, so try that first.\nAfter that, the simplest solution is to turn on \"Ignore Ownership\" on the drive. Navigate to the drive in Finder and use Get Info... to see the permissions, as you have been doing. Underneath the permissions, you'll see a box that says \"Ignore Ownership on this volume.\" Check that box. This will ignore all permissions on the volume and allow any user or program to do anything on the drive. Follow this link for more information on the benefits and perils of doing this: https://larryjordan.com/articles/mac-os-set-hard-drive-permissions/\nAlternatively:\nYou can reset the permissions using the Terminal App. Open the app in Applications > Utilities > Terminal. \nNavigate to the folder you're having trouble with using the \"cd\" command, then use the command\nsudo chmod -R 644 .\n\nThis will change the directory and every file within that directory to the default OS X permissions. For more information on how to use Terminal and chmod, take a look at this tutorial:\nhttp://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction--mac-3855\n\nA: On a folder or file, right click -> Information -> Share and permissions\nOr from Terminal : chmod, chown, ...\n", "Q: Cant SSH from my mac computer: ssh_exchange_identification I try to ssh to my local raspberry pi and I get:\neran-mac:~ eran$ ssh 192.168.178.24\nssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host\neran-mac:~ eran$ \n\nI tried with -v and then:\neran-mac:~ eran$ ssh -v 192.168.178.24\nOpenSSH_5.9p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8x 10 May 2012\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /Users/eran/.ssh/config\ndebug1: /Users/eran/.ssh/config line 1: Applying options for *\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config\ndebug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for *\ndebug1: /etc/ssh_config line 53: Applying options for *\ndebug1: Connecting to 192.168.178.24 [192.168.178.24] port 22.\ndebug1: Connection established.\ndebug1: identity file /Users/eran/.ssh/id_rsa type -1\ndebug1: identity file /Users/eran/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1\ndebug1: identity file /Users/eran/.ssh/id_dsa type -1\ndebug1: identity file /Users/eran/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1\nssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host\neran-mac:~ eran$ \n\n\nA: Most of the time it is a server side problem, so check your Raspberry Pi.\nMajority of GNU/Linux distributions have /var/log/secure, you can find more data about why connection is closed.\nAlso check /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/hosts.allow if they are maybe blocking the access.

In the podcasts list in iTunes, some podcasts don't show an image.  Is there a way to assign one?\nOnline help in iTunes suggests doing a Get Info and clicking the Artwork tab, but that tab is always dimmed, even for podcasts that do show an image.\nAttempting to Google this mostly shows things about how the creator of a podcast can provide an image.  But I want to assign an image when the creator didn't.\n\nA: It seems to me that unfortunately there is no way of assigning custom artwork to subscribed podcast trough iTunes.\n", "Q: How do I control which applications receive mouse input? On Windows I have been using X-Mouse Button Control to control which applications receive mouse input. I need to know how to do this on a Mac.\nSpecifically I am using Mumble and want to bind the \"back\" button on the mouse to Push To Talk globally. It must have no action in any other application.\nI'm using an MMO 7 mouse. But sadly the software that comes with it does not have this functionality.\n\nA: I have used USBOverdrive in the past with Logitech gaming mice. ( Not for gaming but the number of buttons)\nThe app gave me control over what buttons would trigger when in different apps. It has global options also.\n\nThe USB Overdrive is a device driver for Mac OS X that handles any USB mouse / trackball / joystick / gamepad / media keyboard and any Bluetooth mouse from any manufacturer and lets you configure them either globally or on a per-application, per-device basis. Note that the Apple Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad are not handled by the USB Overdrive to let Mac OS X implement its full multitouch support.\nThe USB Overdrive reads all kinds of wheels, buttons, switches and\n  controls and assigns them to useful actions like clicking, typing,\n  scrolling, launching, opening documents and so forth. It can easily\n  handle several USB devices at once and can assign different settings\n  to each one.\nThe USB Overdrive works in Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), 10.7 (Lion)\n  and 10.8 (Mountain Lion) in both 32-bit and 64-bit modes. Users of\n  previous Mac OS X releases should stick with version 3.0.1 of the USB\n  Overdrive.\n\n", "Q: How do I import an MP4 video created using the GoPro Hero Camera into the iPad? I have recorded some videos using the GoPro Hero Camera set at 960p resolution and 48 frames per second. These videos come out in MP4 format and I an play them on my computer (PC) just fine. However when I try to import them into iTunes and sync with the iPad 4 it says that the video is not in the correct format and can't be played. This is surprising because I was able to do this before on an iPad 2 with no problems. How can I fix this?\n\nA: From Apple iPad 4 tech spec:\n\nMPEG‑4 video up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second\n\nSo based on that info, FPS and resolution for mp4 are too high. Use Handbrake and convert to H.264 that supports HD on iPad.\nOtherwise you can try Azul media player for iPad that can play almost all formats.\n\nA: I had the same problem. So i changed my settings to 30 frames per second and it solved the problem. I can now view my go pro vids on ipad. I use the 1080 resolution, by the way, but i dont think youll have a problem using 960. Good luck!\n\nA: I had the same problem and just found the answer, set your GoPro to NTSC instead of PAL.

I've already gone to system preferences and have chosen a wallpaper for second desktop, but it remains all white???\n\nA: On Mountain Lion, you have to open System preferences and drag the window to corresponding desktop at which you want to change the wallpaper. Then select background picture of choice.\n\nA: I occasionally use two monitors, and I use a program called SwitchResX (in the menu bar) to easily switch between resolutions, color spaces and monitor sets so I don't have to go to the clumsy system preference pane to click all over the place. \nI have some scripts which automatically change desktop wallpapers. What I've noticed is that, you should basically have the monitor in question at least temporarily set as the main display when you want to change the wallpaper. When you're done choosing a wallpaper for it, you can set the other one as the main one again. Now the secondary monitor should keep the wallpaper that you've set. I believe this is a setting thing, but in my case I keep separate wallpapers on each monitor, and the time-specific scripts only affect my main monitor while the secondary one's wallpaper has to be changed manually, using the procedure that I just described.\nI think you should be able to control wallpapers of multiple monitors using Mac's own system preferences, but since I found it so clumsy and don't do it that way, I can't assist more than what someone already said about it in the previous comment.\n", "Q: How to include secondary drives' files into 'All My Files' feature I have a dual drive setup (SSD as boot, HDD for storage in my Mac).\nI would like to know how I can include files form my HDD into finders features like 'All My Files'\n\nA: 'All My Files' is a Smart Folder, that is, a saved Spotlight search, named myDocuments.cannedSearch:\n\nand located in /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/MyLibraries.

I'd like to install Windows on my early 2011 MBP via Bootcamp so I can run a highly critical piece of software (Guild Wars 2).\nThe system reqs. are XP or better.\nWhich version of Windows?\nOn searching Amazon, I found that there are several versions of Windows for sale.\nThere's Windows 7 Home Premium. That sounds about right I guess. But does the \"Premium\" tag mean there's also a cheaper \"non-premium\" version available? If so, should I get that instead?\nI understand that the current version is Windows 8. But my sense is that with Windows, one doesn't always want to run the current version.\n\n\n*\n\n*Which release version (XP, Vista, 7, or 8) and feature version (Home, Premium, whatever) is least likely to make me miserable?\n\n*Should I install the 32 or 64-bit version? (64-bit, I guess, right?)\n\nA: Looking at the Bootcamp 5 FAQ - you want a 64 bit version of Windows 7 or 8.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5639\nFurthermore, you'll want to get your specific model of MacBook Pro and check this table for the exact version you want before shopping:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5634\nAs for major version, I know many businesses that stuck with Windows 7 so unless you need Windows 8 - I'd vote with my wallet on the cheapest non-XP version you can get. From your question, the home version is perfect for gaming and you won't really need advanced pro/premium features based on the requirements (actually lack thereof) that you listed. A benefit of going to Windows 8 now is that presumably you'll have longer to run with it before needing to upgrade to a future OS. Mark also makes a good point that Windows 8 is marketed primarily to consumers as an upgrade version, so be sure you understand your return options when buying and check into a Windows 8 system builder / OEM version if you decide to go with 8.\n", "Q: Can a Mac Mini have 3 external monitors connected to it? Thinking of getting a mac mini for work.\nCan I connect three monitors to it? If so, how?\n\nA: Yes, a mac mini can have multiple monitors connected to it. There are now very good USB to Video solutions on the market that will correct this limitation.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a good Mac compatible USB to DVI or USB to VGA adapter. There\nare many available from different manufacturers. Look for adapters\nthat contain the DisplayLink chip as these are Intel-Mac compatible.\n\n*Make sure you've downloaded the latest DisplayLink Mac Drivers, like\nthese: http://sewelldirect.com/Drivers/DisplayLink-OSx-1.1.zip\n\n*Install the drivers through the guided setup by first selecting the\nimage file (.dmg) and opening it, accept the license agreement,\nselect which drive to install the driver on (Macintosh HD), press the\ninstall button, and restart your computer.\n\n*Plug your USB to Video adapter into your computer's USB port and\nattach your monitor's cable to the adapter. You can do this while\nyour computer is on and it will recognize the device in the same way\nit recognizes most plug-n-play devices.\n\n*Once your computer recognizes the adapter, it should automatically\nextend your desktop. If you prefer that it mirror the original\nmonitor instead, or if you want to change any of the resolution\nsettings, go to the Systems Preferences area and select \"Displays\".\n\n\nWhen setting up multiple monitors choosing two of the same size is recommended.\nSource.\n\nA: I'd depending on your output resolution requirement I'd use a Triplehead2Go DP Edition to take a single output and split it into two (or three).\nThe obvious issue the th2g is that it not possible to to output higher than 4080 x 768 (3 x 1360 x 768). The device can do 5760 x 1080 (3 x 1920 x 1080) but the OS cannot choose the correct output settings.\nYou can also put dualhead2Go on the displayport output and then use the HDMI for the third monitor, this way each output on the dualHead can output up to 1920x1200 @ 50 or 60Hz.\n", "Q: Under what conditions is internet required to watch a rented/downloaded movie on iPhone/iPad? I've had some issues before when trying to watch a rented/downloaded movie on a plane when I have no internet connection. Get the message that internet is required to authorize.\nUnder what conditions is internet required to play a rented movie (already downloded)?\nNote: I typically download to my mac then transfer the movie to the iPhone/iPad using iTunes then night before. Not sure if that makes a difference.\nI've successfully watched some movies but have had issues with others. Seemed like if I followed Airline instructions to completely power down my device, then it will give me an error if I try to playback later.\nI often start the movie just before the flight when I do have internet and then pause it. Not sure if that is helping or hurting. No, not past the 24 hr mark at any time. I use this technique with the thought that if I authorize it once, then it won't try to authorize later. Maybe the powering down forces a re-authorization?\nNote: I absolutely can't believe that I have to ask this question.\n\nA: You always need an internet connection to start the rental period in my experience. Only a few packets need to transfer from the device to the server - so you are not streaming the movie.\nThink of it like a credit card authorization - without the central server \"charging\" the rental, the 24 hour playback window can't start properly.\nYour experiment that some rentals play is interesting and hopefully someone has a deeper packet analysis to present, but the safe bet is to not rely on a rental if you don't have in-flight WiFi to start the rental period and authorize the movies you intend to have \"activated for watching\" during the flight.\n", "Q: How to change iCloud storage size for Emails?

Is it possible to tweak Safari to ensure command key combinations like ⌘H or ⌘L go to Safari as opposed to Safari's window contents?\nThis comes up for me most often on this site because the editor window (like where I'm typing right now) captures these keystrokes to make headings and links, but in general, it seems like a security hole to allow sites to capture command keystrokes.\nPlease note that I'm looking for a way to do this without disabling JavaScript altogether.\nFor whatever it's worth, I'm running Mountain Lion.\n\nA: The only surefire way to avoid having JavaScript trap keyboard input is to disable JavaScript in the browser.\nI understand you'd like to leave JavaScript on, but it is designed to pass near total control of raw key presses to the browser and not to the app once the OS hands it input data. This means you would need a specific code solution for each implementation of keyboard filtering on potentially each individual page/site to ensure arbitrary key chords like Command H get sent to Safari instead of JavaScript.\nSee these links for an overview of how key presses are handled:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#keys\n\n*http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html\n\n*http://unixpapa.com/js/testkey.html\nThe last link is a tester to show you the raw events and you will see that even a brief ⌘Q can be trapped by JavaScript if the website developer wishes to do so.\n", "Q: Turning on FileVault fails on MacBook Pro with 'disk in use by driver' error I am trying to turn on FileVault on my retina MacBook Pro (running OS X 10.8.4), and after going through the key generation it fails with a \"Disk in use by driver\" error, as shown:\n\nI've got nothing running (I had quit all applications) except Finder, and no USB or external drives are connected, and I am connected to AC power.\nSo, what could be wrong?\n\nA: You can try using the command line version, fdesetup. The simplest method of doing so is opening Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities) and typing \n\nsudo fdesetup enable\n\nOnce you put in your username(type it exactly as shown in the terminal window before the \":~\" ) and password, it will give you a recovery key. Write it down and double check it! This is your only way back into the system if you forget your password. \nReboot the computer and the process should begin. \nIf that gives you the same error, you can try doing a deferred process. \nNOTE TO ALL:\nDo not do this method if you have a mac with a Fusion Drive in it. \nTo do so, open Terminal and type: \n\nsudo fdesetup -defer ~/Desktop/recovery.plist\n\nThis will run full disk encryption at reboot, so everything will be closed. The user you are logged in as will be the default username/password used to unlock your encrypted drive.  Since this method will not display the recovery key, it will be saved on your Desktop as \"recovery.plist\". Treat this as your password, it is just as powerful. Once you reboot, write this down somewhere safe. \nHopefully this works out for you, and as always, be sure to make an unencrypted backup before you do this, just to prevent any data loss.\n", "Q: Finder window left border display bug I see a strange thing on all left borders of Finder windows:\n\nThe background is 1px moved, and the rounded corner mask fails.\nI thought it was only me, but I saw this on several computers (iMacs and MBP, ML).\nI can't believe Apple saw this and did not fix it… Anybody know where it comes from?\nEDIT\nAnd after upgrading from 10.8 to 10.9.3, I got the same + a 2px height (instead of 1) title bar border…\nIt now resolves when displaying and hiding toolbar.\nEDIT bis\nSo, I had a brand new Mac in hands, didn't install any software yet, and when I hid the Toolbar and showed the status bar, same bug.\nSo you all have this (don't you ?).\n\nEDIT ter\nSo, just updated to Yosemite, on 10.10.2, there's still a similar bug.\nAm I the only one to use Finder windows without toolbar?

I know through System Preferences I can disable all the function keys. However, I really only need two of the function keys to have different functions. Rather than having to always press 'fn', is there a way to disable just these function keys?\n\nA: FunctionFlip\nFunctionFlip can 'flip' certain function keys instead of changing all keys.\n\nFunctionFlip individually controls your MacBook or MacBook Pro's function keys, turning special keys back to regular F-keys, or vice-versa.\n\n\n\nFunctionFlip's purpose is simply to disable the special features — rewind, play, mute, etc. — on the function keys. For example, if you \"flip\" F7, F8, and F9, those keys — only those keys — will revert back to normal F keys. Press the fn key with the special key to get the special function back.

I never did anything to integrate GMail with my OS, never requested that the image be shared anywhere, and can't find a way to delete it.\nThis leads to two questions:\n1) How do I ensure that my laptop login picture is not associated with anything, anywhere, ever?\n2) Where would I go to submit feedback to Apple in order to tell them \"never, ever do things like this\"?\n\nA: 1) As you clarified in the comments, you have used your GMail account for instant messaging using Adium. My guess would be that Adium took your OS X account picture (or you assigned it manually) and synchronized it with Google. It should be easy to verify this by changing your contact picture in Adium.\nI can`t test it right now, but will try later and also try to come up with a solution to turn of the synchronization.\n2) https://ssl.apple.com/support/feedback/\nBut I don't think that OS X has anything to do with it, since I believe that the updating of your GMail avatar was done by Adium.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 water damage Phone stopped working.

I have a lot of them, and it takes literally hours to arrange them. Any shortcuts to make it easier?\n\nA: I found this, and it works:\nSay you restore your iPhone with a full wipe and restore. Then you choose a previous backup to restore all of your settings and applications. When your iPhone is done restoring to your backup, all your icons are mixed up on the SpringBoard.... what the heck? You want to get them back don't you? Well, I know a trick and I don't think it's documented anywhere. Here it goes.\n**Important: Before starting these instructions, backup your iPhone. Then go into iTunes preferences and turn on \"Disable automatic syncing for iPhones and iPods\" This way your backup won't get overwritten after your iPhone gets restored.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore your iPhone and let it restart and activate.\n\n*Then iTunes will happily ask you if you want to restore from a previous backup (with all of your settings and Applications). Click the backup you want to restore to and let it restore and reboot.\n(Here's where things get messed up. Your iPhone backup actually restored the correct icon positions except none of your apps were installed before the restore was complete, so iTunes has to copy all of your apps back to your iPhone. When it does this, it copys them in alphabetical order, thus messing up the location of all your 3rd party icons). Here's how to fix this without memorizing where all your icons went.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click (or Control-click) on the iPhone icon in iTunes and choose \"Restore from Backup\" and choose the backup you chose in step 2 again.\n\n*Let your iPhone restore for a second time and when it reboots, all of your icons will be in their original places. (This is because iTunes didn't have to install the Apps because they were already there, thus keeping them in their original locations according to the backup).\n\n*Return your iTunes preferences and uncheck \"Disable automatic syncing for iPhone and iPod\"\n\nA: The arrangement of icons and folders is backed up to iTunes and iCloud, so unless you are doing something out of the normal, a simple restore from the backup will restore the position of the icons, the user data and allow all of the apps to download from the store once your settings are restored.\n", "Q: Changing the command prompt of Terminal I have found myself to grow fond to CentOS's command prompt which looks like the following:\n [user@host directory]$ cmd\n\nI, personally, do not like how Mac OS X Terminal is laid out, which is:\n host:directory user$ cmd\n\nIs there any way to change the prompt of Terminal's commands to make it look more like the first one?

Would it be slow?\n\nA: The 2010 11 inch Air is so much faster than a Core 2 Duo - top of the line, 15 inch MacBook pro that it's really not much of a comparison between the newer 2013 Air and anything that isn't a pro based logic board (the 27 inch iMacs tend to be the highest of end \"mobile\" processors with logic boards that tend towards the pro range).\nUnless you need a larger display, I see no reason to shift your entire workload to any of the three last Air machines if you don't wait undue minutes for builds in Xcode to complete. From where I sit, the SSD drives and the 2013 processor lineup make for extremely productive workstations in the Air form factor.\n", "Q: Since upgrade to iOS my phone does not remember position in audiobooks I upgraded my iPhone 3GS to iOS 6 from iOS 5 last week.\nSince then the phone doesn't remember its position in audiobooks any more and most often (sometimes it remembers the position) starts at the beginning of a chapter near my last position. This happens whether or not the phone was turned off between plays.\nAlso, the phone forgot its ringtone and when I configured it to use my ringtone again, it suddenly started playing it very loudly despite the fact that it was set to mute. It also wouldn't stop playing it for several seconds even though I returned to the home screen and pressed the on/off button a few times.\nAre these issues with iOS 6, new \"features\" or problems with my old phone?\n\nA: I found this solution to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your iPhone (or iPod or else, here we'll assume an iPhone) , fire iTunes\n\n*In iTunes, select all the songs in your Music (not in your iPhone)\n\n*Right-click and choose \"Get Info\"\n\n*On the window appearing, choose the \"Option\" Tab and select \"Yes\" for \"Remember Playback Position\"\n\n*Click OK to save and then synchronize your iPhone (depending on your iPhone synchronization settings, it should take over the changes from your Music to your device)\n\n", "Q: Thunderbolt Display does not recognize USB keyboard I have a Macbook Pro which I use in combination with a Thunderbolt display.\nI also have a standard Apple USB keyboard with numeric keypad which is plugged in one of the USB ports of the Thunderbolt display.\nThe problem I have is, that the keyboard is often not recognized. Usually when I shut the laptop down and start it again. I usually managed to bring it to work when I unplug the keyboard several times and plug it in again OR I open the settings and wait for some time and do random things.\nI don't have any problems when I just put the Mac to sleep. The keyboard will still work when I wake the Macbook up again.\nThe keyboard works perfectly well when I connect it with the Macbook directly - so it seems not to be an issue with the cable. Other USB devices work in the ports of the display - so this seems not to be the issue as well. \nBut of course I want it to work with the display so that I don't have to unplug too many things to take my laptop away.\n\nA: A late answer because I only just had this problem!\nSo I did everything in all the other posts I could find on this [MBP Retina 15\" Intel Core i7 Moutain Lion (10.8.4) - twin Thunderbold 27\" screens]:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug everything\n\n*Turn everything off\n\n*Wait 30 minutes (not seconds) \n\n*Tried all combinations of re-plugging and re-powering up\n\n*Tried all combinations of re-start / sleep / wake\n\n*Tried SMR reset & PRAM reset\n\n\nAll to no avail.\nAnd the key board worked fine plugged into the MBP - so it had to be the USB port, right?\nBut wait!... another identical keyboard plugged into the USB port worked just fine :S\nSo, my solution (fwiw):\n\n\n*\n\n*I unplugged the USB keyboard and walked away for an hour\n\n*I did absolutely nothing else\n\n*I plugged it into the same USB socket on the same TB monitor\n\n*And it worked!... I am typing this on it now.\n\n\nGo figure!  My take is that there is some sneaky circuitry in the keyboard that's at fault and all the attention has been on the USB port (where mine was too!)\nHope this helps others who may be searching on this very problem, as I was.\n\nA: I followed the advice of a poster in the Apple forums, and used a USB extension cable between the keyboard and thunderbolt display. It fixed the problem for me, and no-one seems to know why. It might be something to do with changing the cable's impedance, or maybe it's a bus timing issue. Either way, it worked for me.\n\nA: I discovered that when I plug the USB cable of the keyboard into the short USB extender cable (that came with the keyboard) and then plug the extender cable into the Thunderbolt display, it works for me. Maybe it will work for you too.\n\nA: System: Macbook Pro with Mavericks, 27in TD display, USB Keyboard\nWhat didn't work: Unplugging/plugging the USB keyboard would normally resolve the issue. However, today unplugging did not work so I took it a few steps further by rebooting everything and plugging/unplugging the USB cable multiple times - all to no avail. The system preferences/keyboard application has functions for setting up a bluetooth keyboard, but nothing to recognize/default to the USB keyboard when you have a laptop connected.\nWhat worked: I plugged the short USB extender cable (that came with the keyboard) into the Thunderbolt display then plugged the USB cable of the keyboard into the extender cable with everything powered on (TB display and macbook pro) and it started working immediately. I will try and update this post in a few weeks or months to let you know if this issue came back.\n\nA: Thanks guys for your suggestions.\nUnfortunately nothing worked for me. However, I solved the problem. This is what I did.\nI use the Mac in the office, so there was another free keyboard - same apple usb thing. I plugged it in the Thunderbolt Display as the other keyboard before. Never had any problems since then. Works perfectly. Magic.\n\nA: Somebody told me to FIRST add the magsafe power to the macbook air and then plug in the thunderbolt display, while leaving the lid closed. After that, all my strange power problems disappeared (i leave it closed at home)\n\nA: Now it's getting interesting! Of course I had to return my colleagues keyboard when he returned from his hols. \nSo I took the old keyboard again until I finally get a new one. \nAnd - surprise - I now works without any problems now. Didn't experience any issues since then!\nWonder how but actually I'm happy it works.\n\nA: Thanks for all the suggestions folks. Here's my fix, based on suggestions from you all:\n\n\n\nBefore you waste time reading below, just skip to UPDATE3. My conclusion: The Apple keyboard will NOT work when plugged in to the USB port of the 27\" TB monitor.\n\n\n\nI grabbed a coworker's mac keyboard (Same Model as mine : Model A1243) and plugged it into a free usb port on the back of my TB monitor. The coworker's keyboard worked immediately and then suddenly my keyboard started working too. Both keyboards plugged in at the same time and both worked fine.\nI unplugged the other keyboard and now mine is fine.\nHaven't attempted a reboot yet to see if it continues to work. Maybe I'll just buy another keyboard and keep two always plugged in and then pull out the one that works when i need it.\nUPDATE: Reboot failed to recognize the keyboard...again. However, I plugged a thumbdrive into one of the other free usb ports. The thumbdrive was immediately recognized and guess what....so was my keyboard. Thumbdrive will just stay in place until next reboot.\nUPDATE2: Next reboot failed, even with thumb drive in place, so no help.\nNext, I unplugged the keyboard from the back of the TB monitor. Rebooted. Waited until network connected to internet (through the TB Cable), then plugged in keyboard. All OK with that.....for now.\nUPDATE3: OK fine. I'm giving up. Boot up this morning and NOTHING on this stinking keyboard. It's like my previous tricks were a 1 time coupon, cashed in, not useable again. Nothing that worked before is working now. I'm just gonna have to plug my keyboard directly into my MBpro where it works without issue. One day, I will have enough free hours (like never) to drag my MBPro and my 27\" TB monitor to the Mac Store and let the real geniuses figure it out. For now, I'll just suffer the inconvenience.\n\nA: I have the same issue: Thunderbolt display, Macbook Pro and an external keyboard plugged in to the display. Sometimes on initial boot, sometimes after waking, the keyboard doesn't seem to be recognized. If I unplug the thunderbolt from my Macbook for a bit, then plug it back in, the keyboard usually starts to work. Sometimes it takes doing it twice. Severe pain in the rear.\n\nA: I have the same issue with a new Mac Pro. Eventually I plugged in another Mac USB keyboard which worked straight away. Then plugged original one back in and that worked too.\nI have to redo that after reboots but at least I got it working again.\n\nA: I have same issue as above: MacBook Pro, Thunderbolt display, and extended Apple keyboard. At startup my keyboard isn't recognized, but it is when awaking from sleep mode.\nMy fix has simply been to unplug the keyboard from the USB port then replug it into the same USB port. Even doing that has been mildly annoying, but it sounds easier than a lot of things that have been suggested in other answers.\nI don't remember getting an extender cable with my keyboard. I might look into purchasing one to solve this mild annoyance.\n", "Q: Compiz-like effects on OS X I recently moved from Linux to OS X. \nSo far nothing has disappointed me but I miss the compiz desktop effects I used to have on my Debian (on Ubuntu before I moved to Debian) with xfce and compiz like 3D effects, desktop workspaces in 3D view and many more:\n\n\n\n\nI tried searching for equivalent or similar stuff for OS X but no luck.

Web designers and developers using Macs (and others) need to run (Windows) Internet Explorer for testing, and a popular option here is Parallels, which virtualises Windows in the background and lets you run Interent Explorer from the dock as if it was a regular Mac app.\nThe problem is, you need a Windows DVD or image file, which you then install into the Parallels virtual machine. \nBuying a Windows licence purely for the purpose of this is one option - but the idea of financially rewarding Microsoft for IE doesn't sit well with anyone who's spent hours fighting with IE's many bugs. \nPiracy isn't/shouldn't be an option for tools for professional work.\nSo, I'm looking for another way to get a working, legal copy of Windows into Parallels.\nFor another Windows virtualisation product - Virtualbox - it's possible to acquire a free, legal Windows image published by Microsoft for the purposes of testing, that comes with IE and essentially nothing else. However, the source I know for this (https://github.com/xdissent/ievms, also advocated on this site in this question) seems to be specific to Virtualbox.\nIs there an equivalent legal, free source of Windows for Mac IE testing virtualisation purposes that works with Parallels?\n\nA: Got it working. Microsoft currently publish free, official Windows virtual machines for things like Parallels and others, for exactly this sort of testing - currently distributed on http://modern.ie \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the visualization page downloads section and choose 'Mac' then 'Parallels'.\n\n*For me (on Lion, July 2013) the \"IE9 – Win7\" VM didn't work at all, but the \"IE10 – Win7\" worked first time. Download it and extract the pvm file using the terminal commands provided. It's a big download, about 3.5gbs.\n\n*Run the newly extracted pvm file (after installing parallels) which should open in Parallels and boot up. If it asks if the VM was 'Moved' or 'Copied', chose \"Copied\".\n\n\n\n\nA few tips for working with Windows through Parallels in this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloads within IE go to the regular Mac download folder by default\n\n*It seems to work first time with whatever input methods you have on the Mac. Copy and paste between applications \"just works\", and (unlike Virtualbox), if you usually use a non-standard input device like a graphics tablet, it works in the visualized Windows windows just as well as everywhere else\n\n*...that said, it still interprets the numpad default differently as by default numpad numbers are arrow keys until you hit the 'Clear' button (while your Windows VM is focused) then it acts just like when the NumLock key is on for PC keyboards, i.e. you get numbers. \n\n*If you have trouble entering credentials for any web pages, it seems like it adds a domain of its own (e.g. \"IE10win7\") rather than using the default for your network. If you have trouble logging in, try adding your network domain with a Windows-style backslash (e.g. enter domain\\username as your username instead of username)\n\n*To switch so that instead of ae Windows window with desktop, start button, etc, it treats each Windows application like a Mac application with its own separate window and doc icon, switch to 'Coherence mode' (View > Enter coherence)\n\n*In 'Coherence mode', where Windows apps are treated and docked just like Mac apps, if you need to get to the windows desktop view for any reason, use the red parallels icon in the tray at the top right and 'Exit coherence'.\n\n\nAnd just in case anyone is in the exact same position as me, needing IE for testing and for doing stuff in Sharepoint, you can install Sharepoint Designer in the VM but it has to be the 32 bit version.\n\nA: Virtualization is not the only solution to this problem, though it is the most stable. Though you may not respect Microsoft's work on Internet Explorer enough to buy it, you should respect your customer's decision to use it when doing web development. If you don't feel comfortable buying Windows or if your IE userbase is very small, there are other solutions. You've already found one option, the virtual machines that Microsoft makes available.\nAnother option is Wine Bottler, which can easily install versions of Internet Explorer as Mac apps through Wine. \nIf testing interaction is less of an issue, you can use IE NetRenderer to get a screenshot of your site in different versions of IE.\n", "Q: Dual monitor for 2.2GHz MacBook Pro (MD318LL/A) Late 2011 MBP I was wondering is it possible to have 2 external 1080P monitors attached to my MBP?\nMy machine have a Thunderbolt port. \nThe monitors have HDMI, VGA, and DVI.

I'm not having any problems in booting Windows 8 or using it.\nHowever, I can't seem to get the Boot Camp drivers to install properly. I don't need Boot Camp to help me boot, I just need the drivers to get things like the keyboard, trackpad, and wifi adapter functioning properly.\nI downloaded Boot Camp Support Software 5.0.5033 and extracted the contents. I was not able to run Boot Camp setup directly. I got the message \"Installation Error. Boot Camp x64 is unsupported on this computer model\". From my research, this often happens when trying to install Boot Camp in Windows. As described here, I opened an elevated command prompt and navigated to the BootCamp\\Drivers\\Apple folder and ran \"msiexec /i BootCamp.msi\". This launched the Boot Camp install process, which appeared to install the Boot Camp drivers with no problems. I saw no error messages. After the install finished, I rebooted. The install seems to have partly worked - for example, the LED keyboard was dark before and now it is lit up, and a taskbar notification icon was added that says \"ENG\" and indicates I'm using an Apple keyboard.\nHowever, I've noticed a number of things that suggests the drivers didn't install properly.\nThe Boot Camp Control Panel has only one tab, \"Startup Disk\". Based on this link which describes a typical Boot Camp install in Windows, I would expect the Control Panel to have tabs such as Keyboard, Trackpad, etc. None of those are present.\nThe Device Manager still shows the default drivers for devices such as the keyboard. Again, I would expect the Device Manager to look as it does in the previous link. Instead, I don't see any of the drivers that Boot Camp said it was installing. Also, the \"Other Devices\" branch has several devices such as the Network Controller, Bluetooth USB Host Controller, and PCI Simple Communications Controller listed as not functioning properly.\nFinally, things like two-finger-clicking the trackpad to open the Windows context menu, or Fn+F5/Fn+F6 to decrease/increase the keyboard brightness, are not working.\nI've tried running the Boot Camp install again, and it found the previous install and offered to repair it. I did this, and rebooted, but nothing has changed.\nI've tried going into the BootCamp\\Drivers\\Apple folder and running the individual driver install executables. Again, these run with no problem and indicate that they succeeded by displaying green checkmarks, but again nothing changes.\nI've tried going into Device Manager and updating the drivers manually (for instance, I told it to look in the Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository folders for the various Apple drivers such as the trackpad or wifi), but Windows just says it can't find any compatible drivers there.\nI would try using the Apple Software Update, except I can't get the wifi adapter working. If that's likely to fix the problem, then I'll go get a dongle to hook up my Cat 5 cable.\nIn summary, is there anything special I need to know when installing the Boot Camp drivers in Windows 8?\nThank you!\nEdit 9/22:\nIt may be that the drivers in the Boot Camp Support Software 5.0.5033 are not recent enough for the hardware in the 2013 Mac Air. I'm not a driver expert but here are my observations.\nI started by trying to get the wifi adapter driver updated. According to a teardown*, the Air has a Broadcom BCM4360. According to wikidevi* the Windows hardware ID for that is PCI\\VEN_14E4&DEV_43A0.\nI then went to \\BootCamp\\Drivers\\Broadcom and opened BroadcomEthernet64.exe using 7Zip. There is only one .inf file in there, b57nd60a.inf. I opened that. I found references to Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Server 2008, but no Windows 8. I found many IDs named PCI\\VEN_14e4&DEV_xxxx, but no PCI\\VEN_14E4&DEV_43A0.\nI also opened BroadcomNetworkAdapter64.exe. There is only one .inf file in there, bcmwl6.inf. I opened that and found references to Windows 7, but no Windows 8. I found IDs named PCI\\VEN_14E4&DEV_43xx, which are a little closer to the mark, but no PCI\\VEN_14E4&DEV_43A0.\nMy guess is that when I try to install the Boot Camp drivers, the process completes without any errors but many of the drivers are not actually installed because the Windows hardware IDs in the .inf files do not match the hardware in the machine.\nI looked around to see if anyone else had a Windows 8 driver for the Broadcom BCM4360. The only one I've found so far is from ASUS*. I downloaded that driver package, scanned it for malware, opened it (it's a .zip file), and found one .inf file, bcmwl63.inf. I opened that and sure enough I found references to Windows 8 and PCI\\VEN_14E4&DEV_43A0 in it. I then successfully installed the ASUS driver on the Air, and Windows Device Manager now recognizes that it has a wifi adapter. However, I'm not able to see any wireless networks, although there are plenty around me. I tried rebooting and that didn't help. My guess is that the ASUS driver has some particulars related to ASUS hardware that prevent it from working properly on the Air.\nSo is this perhaps just a question of waiting until Apple updates their Boot Camp drivers for Windows 8 to include the more modern hardware in the Air 2013?\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't post any more links. I'll try to add these links in a comment, but they're not crucial.\n\n\nA: I know this is 3 months late.\nBut if anyone is still searching, the answer is to use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the drivers. The ones from the Apple Bootcamp website will not work.\nIf you check out this article:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5634\nClick on the MacBook Air link at the center of the page and you will see:\nMacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013) and MacBook Air (11-inch, Mid 2013)\nneed to have drivers downloaded from BootCamp Assistant. So, you will need to boot into your Mac partition and plug in a USB drive and download the drivers.\nPS: If the drivers fail to download, make sure your USB stick is attached to the left USB port (the screen facing you). I remember reading it somewhere on Apple's support forum - but cannot find the link at the moment to cite it.\nI did this and it worked for me. The Boot Camp drivers installed and I did not get the x64 error message as well.\n", "Q: iBookstore and Kindle I bought a book in the iBookstore to read on my iPad, but the iPad isn't that easy on my eyes.

So I tried to uninstall by doing\nsudo port uninstall gnutar\n\nbut the binaries are still in place and functioning.\nWhy wasn't it uninstalled?\n\nA: Most likely you have another port installed that depends on gnutar, so the uninstall command didn't remove it. Run\nport dependents gnutar\n\nto see if this is the case (sudo is not required for some port actions like list, installed, dependents, etc.). If you want to uninstall everyone, \nsudo port uninstall --follow-dependents gnutar\n\nwill do the trick, but obviously could lead to unintended consequences, as all the dependents of all the dependents will be uninstalled, recursively, and you could end up decimating your port collection. Only do this if you know exactly what you're doing. gnutar is fairly small and unobtrusive, so if you can't easily get rid of it you won't be that bad off in terms of disk space.\n", "Q: Animating color changes in Keynote How can you animate a color change (i.e as a build) in a Keynote presentation?

(VLC isn't working;)\nCheers\n\nA: Honestly, for working with audio files quickly, my favourite tool is Fission Audio from Rogue Ameoba. It can open and convert to most popular formats, including the two you're after , and more importantly here I would think, it has a batch conversion mode. It's $32 USD, but it's so polished and works so well it's worth the cost.\nBut if you really want free I don't think you can beat the command line for converting lots of files, quickly and easily.\nTo complete these steps you'll need Homebrew installed -- a free package manager for OS X that'll make it easy to get the command line tools you need to do your coversions. See the installation notes for Homebrew on how to install it.\nWith Homebrew installed you'll need a few command line tools to do the conversion. Namely: ffmpeg and lame. But don't fear! Homebrew makes it very easy to install them. Open a Terminal window and type:\nbrew install lame ffmpeg\n\nYou'll get a bunch of other dependencies installed along with those two things. But those are the two key pieces.\nWith these tools installed, you can convert an entire directory full of .m4a files to .mp3 like so:\nfor f in *.m4a; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -acodec libmp3lame -ab 320k \"${f%.m4a}.mp3\"; done\n\nJust run that from a directory full of .m4a files and watch the magic happen.\n\nA: XLD (X Lossless Decoder) is a very well-regarded encoder/decoder, that's quite easy to use.

For testing purposes (testing raw network speed over a number of cables) i have equippped my Mac Book pro with a Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter besides the built-in gigabit ethernet connection.\nBoth interfaces have been assigned a manual IP in the 10.0.*/24 range.\nStarting iperf with iperf -s --bind 10.0.0.1, then starting the client with iperf -c 10.0.0.1 yields speeds of over 40 Gigabit per second. I assume (correctly so according to some googling) that not the interface itself is used but rather the local loopback interface as both IPs reside on the same computer. So my thought was to disable lo0, even just temporarily by issuing sudo ifconfig lo0 down. Thies doesn't work (it might have worked once for a few seconds but I can't prove that). lo0 just stays up.\nIs there a way to (temporarily) disable the local loopback interface lo0 so I can do my tests?\nThanks!\n\nA: The version of iperf I have (from Homebrew) does indeed allow binding the client and server to different interfaces, like so:\niperf -s --bind 10.0.0.1\niperf -c 10.0.0.1 --bind 10.0.0.2\n\n(for the purpose of this answer I assume that you want the server on .1 and the client on .2)\nThe problem is that the routing table (visible through netstat -rn) appears to override this, sending traffic to 10.0.0.1 through the loopback interface.\nRather than disabling loopback altogether, you can delete that specific route:\nsudo route delete 10.0.0.1 127.0.0.1\n\nI found that this caused my Mac to be unable to reach itself (on that IP) for a few seconds, until it found an alternate route out the other interface and through my router. Once that route showed up in netstat -rn, iperf worked fine.

In testing, I opened PDF in OS X Preview (I am on Mountain Lion) and found that by default, the display size is very small, like this: \n\nNotice that I chose View / Actual Size (command-0). Normally the Preview tries to render the page to sized like a piece of paper. \nOn this new monitor, a page renders to a size around 2 credit cards. \nWhere can I find the controls to get OS X to understand display pitch correctly and therefore allows Preview to view actual size correctly? \n\nA: There is a setting in Preview > Preferences, in the Images tab which might be relevant:\n\n\nA: I switched from a DVI-D dual link DVI input, to DisplayPort Input. The monitor supports HDMI, DVI, DP and analog inputs. \nOS X was able to determine the screen DPI on DP. I open a PDF and choose View/Actual size, the size looks right now.   \nI do not know why DVI does not work.

AirPlay in the photos app or any video app works fine:\n\nHowever the AirPlay icon is missing in the taskbar, where it should be according to Apple's documentation:\n\nHow can I get back the AirPlay icon? I've already tried rebooting all devices. \nEdit: This is what I am looking for (source: Apple Support)\n\n\nA: After another round of reboots (first: software update for the Apple TV, second: reboot of the iPad mini), it now works:\n\nIt seems that some hiccup was responsible, which was very, very sticky. So the often mentioned hint of rebooting does really work. Just try it often enough... :)\n\nA: I don't believe the Photos app uses the Airplay icon in the \"taskbar\" at the bottom.  You have the AirPlay icon in the upper right of the Photos app, which is how you AirPlay photos.  I think it only shows up in the taskbar if you're playing music, and possibly for movies too.\nDoesn't it work using the Airplay icon in the upper right?\n", "Q: UTF8 filenames and shell utilities Try the next commands from the terminal:\ntouch á.txt\n$ ls\ná.txt\n\nfind .  -name á.txt -print\n\nprints nothing.\nMy Terminal.app settings are utf8 - see here:\n\nThe question: How to achieve to work transprarently (Finder + command line) with UNICODE filenames?\nI understand than behind the scene is the different unicode normalization, so:\n$ echo á.txt | od -bc\n0000000   303 241 056 164 170 164 012                                    \n           á  **   .   t   x   t  \\n \n\nand when\n$touch á.txt\n$ ls *.txt\ná.txt\n\n$ ls *.txt | od -bc\n0000000   141 314 201 056 164 170 164 012                                \n           a   ́     **   .   t   x   t  \\n   \n\nbut WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?\n\nA: As you mentioned, characters like á are stored or shown in decomposed form (LATIN SMALL LETTER A + COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT) even though most keyboard layouts insert characters in composed form (LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE).\nThe format is a variant of NFD where some ranges of characters are not decomposed. See Text Encodings in VFS:\n\nImportant: The terms used in this Q&A, precomposed and decomposed, roughly correspond to Unicode Normal Forms C and D, respectively.

I encountered a popup similar to this one this morning while checking the weather report at http://touch.woodtv.com/forecast in Safari, though I have not been able to reproduce it.\nThe title is \"about://(null)\" and the text \"Why you no play Candy Crush!!\"  The popup occurred twice.  I tapped Cancel both times.\nI suspect the source of this is rogue JavaScript in an ad network, judging from the fact that the screenshot below shows it in an ad-supported application, and when I saw it, I was on an ad-supported website.  My phone is not jailbroken.\nI'm wondering if anyone is able to identify the source of the popup definitively.  Speculation is running rampant on Apple's support communities and elsewhere, from push notifications (delete Facebook and all your games!) to carrier notifications (which don't work on iPod Touches…), and my gut tells me little of it is helpful.  But I could also be very wrong.\n(This is not my screenshot; it comes from https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5144627.)\n\nUPDATE 1: The Candy Crush people have this to say, but I'm not (yet) convinced there's actually something installed that is to blame: https://forums.king.com/forum/candy-crush-saga/bugs-known-issues-ccs/recent-spam-why-you-no-play-candy-crush/?entryId=2326\nUPDATE 2: Just reproduced it in the iOS Simulator while clicking around woodtv.com, but I'm not sure how to track it down further from here.\n\n\nA: Since I got the popup in iOS Simulator, I was able to use Safari's Develop menu to inspect the page.  From there it was just an exercise in rooting around to find the obfuscated JavaScript, which, when run through jsbeautifier.org (which has the side effect of de-obfuscating it), looks like this:\nvar m = ['iphone', 'ipod', 'ipad', 'android'],\n    u = navigator['userAgent']['toLowerCase']();\nfor (var d = 0; d < m['length']; d++) {\n    if (u['indexOf'](m[d]) != -1) {\n        if (confirm('Why you no play Candy Crush!!')) {\n            window['top']['location'] = document['getElementById']('creative')['href'];\n            break;\n        };\n    };\n};\n\nI think it's pretty safe to say that this is indeed a rogue ad, since on the page where I saw it, the ad itself was blank.  It's trying to get you to click through to a link.\nSo, in other words, it's a real pain in the buttocks, but probably not actual malware.  The ad in question is apparently delivered by AdMax by NEXAGE, so I'll see what I can do about alerting them.\n\nA: Initially I felt this was a faulty ad from the website.\nI looked on an Apple forum (a link here would be ideal) about when the popup started saying that the app they were using (some sodoku game) started lagging and the popup came up. When they clicked cancel, it popped up again, and when they clicked OK, they were redirected to the App Store, but didn't let the page load. They're worried that it's malware but now I'm even more convinced its just a faulty ad.\n", "Q: Local DNS circumvented when WiFi is active I am using Mac OS X 10.8 to connect to two networks through ethernet and wifi and I am experiencing a problem with local DNS resolution. I would really appreciate your advice. \nI am simultaneously connected to two networks. A local network through ethernet (eth) and to the internet through my company's wireless AP (wifi). I would like to be able to query by name my local computers (like ping computer1) but also I would like to have internet connection through wifi. \nIn the Network Preferences I have the following priority: \nFirst ethernet and then wifi. \nBy doing so, it works correctly when I ping local computers by IP. i.e. ping 192.168.1.1 works and I can access the internet as well. DNS settings for each interface are listed correctly in the Network Preferences settings. i.e. DNS for eth is 192.168.1.1 and search domain mydomain.com. For the wifi, DNS are also listed correctly with the settings my company provides.\nIf I disable wifi, local DNS works fine, when using ping computer1 or nslookup computer1. However, when wifi is enabled, I do not succeed in resolving names with the local DNS server. I have found that the resolv.conf file is overwritten when I enable wifi and therefore local DNS server is not contacted, instead my company's DNS is contacted. To be more specific, when wifi is enabled, the resolv.conf file holds only DNS information provided by my company  (even though I prioritised it second position in Network Preferences ):\nSo when WiFi is enable, resolv.conf has the following:\n domain my.work.domain.com  nameserver x.x.x.x  nameserver y.y.y.y  nameserver z.z.z.z\nWhen WiFi is disabled, resolv.conf has the following:  \ndomain mydomain.com.  \nnameserver 192.168.1.1\nSimilar issues appears when using scutil --dns. \nWhen I have BOTH eth and wifi enabled, using  scutil --dns, I get the following:\nDNS configuration\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : my.work.domain.com\n  nameserver[0] : x.x.x.x\n  nameserver[1] : y.y.y.y\n  nameserver[2] : z.z.z.z\n  if_index : 4 (en0)\n  reach    : Reachable  \n(Here are listed but removed by me the rest of DNS resolvers #2 - #7 that normally Mac users have for internet )\nDNS configuration (for scoped queries)\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : mydomain.com\n  nameserver[0] : 192.168.1.1\n  if_index : 6 (en2)\n  flags    : Scoped\n  reach    : Reachable,Directly Reachable Address  \nresolver #2\n  search domain[0] : my.work.domain.com\n  nameserver[0] : x.x.x.x\n  nameserver[1] : y.y.y.y\n  nameserver[2] : z.z.z.z\n  if_index : 4 (en0)\n  flags    : Scoped\n  reach    : Reachable  \nWhen I disable WiFi and only keep ethernet, using  scutil --dns, I get the following:  \nDNS configuration\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : mydomain.com\n  nameserver[0] : 192.168.1.1\n  if_index : 6 (en2)\n  reach    : Reachable,Directly Reachable Address  \n(Here are the same as above resolvers #2 - #7 that normally Mac users have for internet )\nDNS configuration (for scoped queries)  \nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : mydomain.com\n  nameserver[0] : 192.168.1.1\n  if_index : 6 (en2)\n  flags    : Scoped\n  reach    : Reachable,Directly Reachable Address  \nThank you very much for the time you spend for my problem.

I don't want others on the same network (or any network!) to be able to access my machine at port 80, where I have dev websites.\nI've tried adding this rule to ipfw:\ndeny tcp from any to any dst-port 80 in\n\nwhich works, but it also stops me from being able to access my web root whenever I get a new IP (switching to a new wireless network, for example) until I refresh my network interface.\nIs there a rule that I can add into ipfw or (since it's apparently deprecated) into pfctl that disallows any external traffic to port 80?\nEdit: bmike's answer is just perfect. Here's what I've done, for others to see:\nsudo ipfw add 00100 allow ip from any to any via lo0\nsudo ipfw add 90100 deny tcp from any to any dst-port 80 in\nsudo ipfw add 90100 deny tcp from any to any dst-port 443 in\nsudo ipfw add 90100 deny tcp from any to any dst-port 3306 in\n\nThis allows all ports locally, but disallows any incoming connection to 80 (Apache), 443 (https), and 3306 (MySQL, which I already have restricted to localhost, but I still added this just to ensure it).\n\nA: You'll want to be sure you have an allow rule with a lower number than the deny rule.\nSo perhaps:\n00100 allow ip from any to any via lo0\n90100 deny tcp from any to any dst-port 80 in\n\nThis puts the allow very low (make sure you don't have any deny rules in the 0-99 rule number range) and puts the general deny rule at a very high number (presumably you won't be allowing anything on port 80 higher than 90101).\nIf you are not defining a rule file to load all the commands in one shot, have a look at this answer for a slightly different take on restricting ports: How do I use ipfw to allow LAN access but deny Internet access?\n", "Q: Whatsapp Notification to use number of people instead of number of new messages for push icons?

But, due to the awesomeness of Backblaze, I have all of my files and libraries and music, so nothing's lost. The problem is... all of my playlists that I've spent years tweaking, I don't want to lose them! I'm wondering where the file is within iTunes so that I can recover it.\nNote that, whenever I search for this online, all the results I find are all about exporting the playlist and then importing it again. But since my computer crashed and I had to install everything anew on the new computer, I don't have the possibility to export the playlist from iTunes.\nI'd love any pointers or help. Thank you!\n-morgan\n\nA: According to HT1660 playlist information is stored in\n~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library.itl\n\n(and in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml but that is generated from the file above by iTunes and primarily there to give other applications access to your music library). If you restored your Music folder from the backup the file should have gotten restored as well.\n\nA: Far too late for this answer to be useful to the OP…\nbut the trick is, once you've copied your whole iTunes folder from your backup into its original location, to 'spoil' the iTunes Library.itl file, [with iTunes quit] then on next launch it will see the broken file & recreate it, restoring all your playlists.\nYou usually lose a few album covers, idk why, but they can be regained from\nFile > Library > Get Album Artwork.\nYou 'spoil' the itl file from Terminal.  \n\n\n*\n\n*First remove the old .itl from ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library.itl\n\n*Open Terminal & enter this touch ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Library.itl That will create an empty .itl file, broken enough for this.\n\n*Launch iTunes. It will now notice something is 'wrong' & start rebuilding the ITL file, using your existing XML file. The message is 'Importing ‘iTunes Music Library.xml’ This will take some time, but should restore your old structure, intact.\n\nA: Great information!  Led me to a simple fix for Windows 7, Itunes v 12-something.  I deleted the iTunes Library.itl file from my new installation, and copied in the newest one in my Previous iTunes Libraries from my backup.  I deleted the date from the filename so it was once again called iTunes Library.itl, and iTunes displayed all my playlists as of the date of the last backup.\n", "Q: Is there a way to easily move between albums/artists when listening to music on iPhone/iPod touch In the iPhone, whenever I select an artist or album to listen to, the play ends (or repeats) whenever the end of that artist or album is reached.  I would like a way for the music to continue to the next album/artist.  \nOr, what would accomplish the same purpose is if I could choose to play all songs, but sort songs by album and/or artist.  \nIn other words, I would like to play my songs the same way I do on iTunes, in which I can simply play an album, and it will move to the next album or artist (depending on sort) after that current album is done.\nI'm running iOS 6.\n\nA: The best way I have found to do this is to create a playlist on iTunes on my Mac and sync my iPhone with that Playlist.  If I sort by Artist in iTunes before syncing, it is synced that way on my iPhone.  I then scroll through the playlist on my phone to select an album or artist, instead of selecting the artist or album directly.  This way my music app will go to the next artist or album after my current album is finished.\n", "Q: How to fix curl throwing \"error setting certificate verify locations\" I'm a web developer and I have a MacBook4,1 with OS X 10.5.8. Important stuff like GitHub, homebrew, ruby and python doesn't work correctly, because curl doesn't work.\nIt seems that the SSL certificates are outdated.\nI get this error every time:\ncurl: (77) error setting certificate verify locations:\n  CAfile: /usr/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt\n  CApath: none\n\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: That error doesn't explicitly say that the certificates are outdated does it?  It looks to me like it is complaining that the certs are not where they are supposed to be (or potentially they can't be read).\nFound this on google:\nhttp://curl.haxx.se/mail/curlphp-2005-11/0038.html\nTo summarize the poster suggests either using the -k flag with curl to suppress this error (this is obviously less secure) or make sure that what ever process is calling curl has execute access to all directories on the path to the certificates.\n\nA: The problem arises because OS X doesn't keep its CA certs in the file system; they live in the \"System Roots\" keychain. You can see them with the Keychain Access app (found in your Applications/Utilities folder).\nFor those tools that don't know how to talk to the keychain (like curl), you can export these certs to a folder of your choice, say /etc/ssl/certs to be consistent with most linux distros. You can either drag and drop them out of Keychain Access into a finder window, or select them and choose \"Export items...\" from the file menu. With drag and drop it always seems to use the binary .cer format, whereas most CLI tools want base64-encoded PEM (commonly using the .crt file extension). You can export in pem format from keychain access, but it only seems to export one cert at a time even if you have multiple certs selected. To work around this, I wrote a bash script to batch convert .cer to PEM format .crt files:\n#!/bin/bash\n#Convert all .cer files in this folder into PEM format .crt files\nshopt -s nullglob\nfor f in *.cer\ndo\n        openssl x509 -inform der -in \"${f}\" -outform pem -out \"${f%.*}.crt\"\n        rm \"$f\"\ndone\nchmod 444 *crt\n\nTo use it, make a folder, put this script in it (I called it cerconv.sh), drag and drop all your root CA certs into it, open a terminal in that folder and just run bash cerconv.sh.\nTo avoid nefarious things swapping out your CA certs, I added a line to chmod them all as read-only.\nThis may all be unnecessary - I certainly have no trouble with git(hub), homebrew, curl etc without having to do this, and have done for years - but at least you now know how to get the certs.\nThis approach is better than using -k in curl because you're not compromising your security.\nUpdate: I just discovered the security utility on OS X. Here's a command that uses it to to export all certificates from your system keychain into a single .pem file that should be usable with curl:\nsecurity export -p -t certs -k `security list-keychains -d system|cut -d '\"' -f 2` -o certs/certs.pem\n\n", "Q: Disable alt-tab (option-tab) instead of command-tab I am using Mac OS X 10.8.4 on a Macbook Pro and somehow alt-tab is switching between the applications from Dock.

I have spent the last few days trying to figure out exatly what the impact is with changing country and card details on my Apple ID to a new location.\nI changed from Ireland to the UK, and then I realised all my purchases were no longer in the 'apps in the cloud' section meaning I couldn't redownload easily!\nI subsequently talked to senior advisors in Apple and they informed me it was not a big deal and I could download the apps i've paid for already in the Irish store for free. (including both the  Mac App store and iTunes store/iOS store)\nSo all though not great I was happy enough with this solution, while I live in the UK I can redownload what I need for free on demand and when I move back to Ireland I can change it back and all my purchases will be there again, they also confirmed it doesn't affect other Apple ID services like iCloud.\nUpdates are still confsuing me though, I was told that iOS devices would recognise updates and show new updates in the store (which they do!)\nI was also told that iTunes would not allow updates of apps purchased in the old store but I could sync back updates done on my iOS devices... This was the case until I installed iTunes 11.0.4 tonight when for some reason it let me update all my apps in iTunes with no problem?!\nSo my question, did something change in 11.0.4 and now I can get updates for alll apps (old store and new in iTunes)?\nand what about Mac App store - will I get updates for my apps from the old store in that?\nThanks!\n\nA: If you change your region for your Apple ID and iTunes store account, there is no guarantee that the apps you had paid for and downloaded will still be downloadable since you are literally shopping in a different store with different app availability.\nNow, common apps like Evernote and Apple's apps are generally available in all of the countries, but many smaller developers focus on one or two countries and the switching process can mean you lose apps.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1311\nIs there a specific app you have found that is available on the new store, yet your account will not download?

One thing's for sure, not everything that changes gets announced, is permanent or immune from a rollback if it doesn't work as planned.\n", "Q: Applescript, quit app if other app is quit I have a (very basic) apple script that I use as a trigger to start and hijack Plex, using Audio Hijack Pro. \ntell application \"Audio Hijack Pro\"\nstart hijacking session named \"Plex\"\nend tell\ntell application \"Plex\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\nWhere the last three lines just ensure Plex is in the foreground. \nHere is where my question comes in. If possible, I would like to extend my script a little; it should keep running while Hijack Audio Pro is hijacking Plex, and quit Hijack Audio Pro if Plex is quit. Does anyone know how to achieve this?\n\nA: I've only dabbled in Applescript, but would you be able to create a second script that is basically reversed? In English it would look like:\ntell Plex to quit\nthen\ntell Audio Hijack Pro to quit\n\n", "Q: How do I get Mac Calendar app to use outlook instead of Mail app for its email alerts I have been trying to get away from Google lately so I am trying to use the Mac Calendar app for my calendar. I want email notifications for my events but Calendar always launches the Mail app even though outlook is my default mail app.   \n\nA: Sorry, that is not possible since Mac calender only works with mac Mail to send the alerts.\nHowever, in Mac mail, you would be using your chosen email provider (same as in Outlook) so the emails would be send using that provider.\nThe receiver would not know where the email came from.\n", "Q: Can you run OSX as a server without OSX Server.app? I have just set-up a new Hackintosh server running ML (10.8.4) but I have been unable to get a redeem code for the OSX Server.app from the Apple Developer site (some temporary problem).\nHowever do I really need it?\nMy definition of \"server\" is: web server, file server (SMB, AFP), sshd, git server.\nDoes OSX Server.app provide additional server components or is it simply a UI frontend to the config files?  I seem to be able to start sshd and apache without the Server app and have been doing UNIX admin long enough not to be scared of config files, so I'm thinking I can get the server running without it.\nCan anyone advise?\n\nA: For the uses you need, you can do it with base OS X.\nOS X server adds stuff like Time Machine support on networked drives, networked spotlight, Open Directory, policy support, etc.  \nThey're useful features, but you don't really need them for the stuff you're describing.\n", "Q: iPad keeps disconnecting from ad-hoc networks I have a computer with Internet connection via Ethernet, it is Wi-fi capable so in order to share the Internet connection I had set up an ad-hoc network. \nIt works fine with other computers, but if only my iPad is connected, the link breaks whenever mi iPad is sleeping.\nWhen turning on my iPad, I have to reset the ad-hoc network in the computer in order to have Internet available in my iPad again.\nI wonder why it happens.

I understand there's a Newsstand app. I am wondering, however, if I were to purchase a newspaper subscription through the Nook or Kindle systems, will I be able to read them in the standard iPad (iPad 3, iOS 6) apps for each publisher?\nOne reason for concern is that years ago, I found that some things I'd purchased on the Nook -- public domain books at least -- we're invisible to the Nook Windows app. ( Newspaper edition purchases may too have been unreachable).\n\nA: For the Kindle system, if one looks carefully under the product description such as you would find under this list, http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Newspapers/b?ie=UTF8&node=165389011,  one can see a link for \"Available on these devices\". This link will tell you if an Amazon subscription for that newspaper can be read on \"Free Kindle Reading Apps\",  or exclusively on \"Kindle e-readers\".  \nIn order to have the freedom to read on multiple devices (which seems to be the intent of your question, but forgive if I assume too much), you'd want to choose a newspaper available on \"Free Kindle Reading Apps\".\n", "Q: Safari will spontaneously visit URL while I type On my old MacBook Air and even on my brand new Retina MacBook Pro (which was set up as a new computer), if I open a new tab and quickly start typing a URL or search in the bar, Safari will sometimes truncate whatever it is I was typing and act as if I had pressed Return. \nI believe this has something to do with the search suggestions/seek time for bookmarks but it happens stochastically so I can't determine the root cause. \n\nA: This happens if you:\n\n\n*\n\n*have enabled Google as your default search engine\n\n*have enabled Google Instant within your Google search settings\nI have this same situation occur on my Chrome.\n", "Q: iMessage via WiFi only Is there a way to rig iMessage so it receives (and, I guess,sends) messages only when connected via WiFi and not when connected via the carrier's data plan?\n\nA: No, there's no such option / preference. You could, though, turn off your carrier's data plan altogether by turning off the Cellular Data option (under Settings / General/ Cellular on iOS 6 and Settings / General / Network on iOS 5).\n", "Q: Meaning of \"./\" in Mac terminal I am a new user of the Mac terminal.  What is the meaning of \"./\"?  What is the difference between the commands\nrm image.png\nrm ./image.png\nrm *./image.png\n\n\nA: ./ is part of the path to a directory/file.\nIf used as part of a parameter to a command\n\n\n*\n\n*rm image.png and rm ./image.png are exactly the same and identify a file in the current directory\n\n*rm *./image.png is a pattern which looks for files named image.png in all subdirectories of the current directory which end with a dot\n\n\nThe key use for ./ usually is to call a script/executable in the current directory. When you execute a command without specifiying it's directory (e.g. cp instead of /bin/cp), the shell searches for this in all directories listed in the $PATH variable. The current directory is usually not part of that variable (for security reasons) so you can use ./command-name to tell the shell to look for the command in the current directory.\n\nA: The expression in a file path, (./) means 'move up' (from the current location), i.e., 'this' = '.' and / = 'up'   so  ../ means 'move up 2 directories', or, move to the parent of this (./), i.e., take the current location and move up to '/' the new location.\n", "Q: I want to remove all songs from iPhone 5, have unchecked and synced but iTunes still says I have 5GB of audio! I always thought I knew a fair amount about iPhones/iTunes etc but this has me stumped!\nI have a 16 GB iPhone 5 running the latest version of iTunes on a Windows Laptop. I do not have iTunes Match. \nDue to having 100gb of music on the laptop I have already 'checked' the following options in the iPhone 'summary' \n\n\n*\n\n*Sync only ticked songs and videos\n\n*Manually manage music and videos\n\n\nI then went into 'music' and unchecked all the artists, albums etc to the point it said 0 songs (in light grey next to where it says sync music)\nSo looking at that it should mean I have no songs selected, so none on my phone... but no! \nIt is still telling me I have 5gb of audio! I have gone back and forth applying​/syncing​/checking​/unchecking in the hope I have overlooked something but I am now totally stuck on what to try next.\nAll I want to do is remove all songs from the phone and then put some fresh music back on. \n\nA: Assuming you're running the latest iOS (iOS6) \nFrom the Home Screen, go to Settings > General > Usage\nWait while it loads your apps, then select music. \nThen tap 'Edit' and delete your music.\n\n\nA: In my iPhone 5S I found…\n\n\n*\n\n*In Settings → General → Usage → Manage Storage → Music…\n\n\n*Tap on Edit\n\n\n*Tap on the red icon next to All Music and it will show the Delete Button.\n\n\n*Tap on the button to delete all the music files from your device.\n\n\nA: If it helps, I was struggling with this too - then realised Podcasts are counted under music! Clear out your Podcasts in the same way as above, et voila!\n\nA: I was having the same issue. I don't know if you are continuing to have the same problem but I was trying everything I could think of. I tried selecting just a few songs and it would still have others on my phone!\nFinally, I stumbled across the issue. Under the Music tab when you're looking at your phone on iTunes, make sure all of the artists and albums sections are unchecked, as well. That is where all my music selections were hiding.\n\nA: I had the same problem where even though I click yes for it to erase everything so that I could resync my iPhone, none of the music was removed from my phone as it was removed from my iTunes.\nI went to Settings → General → Usage, waited for my apps to load, chose Music, edit, then delete. Took two times for it to work, then I was able to freshly sync my iPhone with music from my iTunes.\nI tried every other process and this is the only thing that worked. Highly recommend an external hard drive to back everything up to as it makes it so much easier when you get a new computer or new hard drive.\n", "Q: iPad mini: Download images from webpage preserving file name One of my hopes in getting a tablet was convenient webcomic reading. However, I am also in the habit of archiving my favorite webcomics. And for that purpose the file name is pretty important.\nSadly I found that when saving images from webpages the iPad has a total disregard for original file names. It just calls them IMG_0001 etc. \nWhile I can preserve file names using the Download Lite app, it comes at the cost of many conveniences such as Chrome's tab synchronization.\nIs it possible to make iOS preserve file names when saving images to the gallery?\nAlso: No jail breaking. If I have to tinker around to that degree anyway, I'd rather stay with Android.\n\nA: Some partial solution's I found since:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using an alternate browser that supports file downloading. Or mercury browser, which doesn't ask for a file name when saving images, but preserves the original file name and is a full alternative browser with features missing from both safari and chrome such as fullscreen and text zooming (though the latter is served by bookmarklets in safari and chrome). Update: \"Documents by Readdle\" is another viable option; Most notably it provides a \"Save As\" style dialogue when downloading files or images, which allows changing the file name right away. \n\n*Chrome download enabler. Sadly, this is a jailbreak tweak, so I didn't try it, but it would give the advantage of having downloads in the same browser that also syncs tabs and bookmarks with the desktop.\n\nA: As far as I know it is not possible to preserve file names when saving to the gallery.\nThis may not be as slick as you hoped, but you can copy the actual image itself and paste that into an email, and in this manner the filename is preserved (the image itself is attached to the email, not a link to the image).\n\nA: I have an indirect solution for downloading images you find on iOS's default browser (or Chrome?), and it will require a PC. Images will be saved on PC storage at first. Then optionally copy them back to iOS with their original filenames and their folder structure. Would you accept this as a trade-off from ability to save images on iOS with original filenames to having images already backed up on your PC with original filenames?\nBookmark to download later (iOS)\nIf it seem obvious to you, then why aren't you gonna do it? I also haven't told you that they can be downloaded with automatic process in some form when you're on your PC. Read on.\nI am using Safari's bookmark to remember images' urls and then when I'm on my PC, downloading the images from bookmark will be of little effort using a batch file. They will be downloaded on PC storage and ultimately have their filenames preserved. I will explain you how to copy and view them on iOS after I've given to you full prerequisites first.\nSometimes when there is an image that you would like to bookmark, that's almost impossible in iOS 8. That's why, I've made a necessary bookmarklet.\nI've used three folders in my bookmark specifically for images I'd like to download off from website when I'm on iOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloads - Not literally; for aria2c.\n\n*Tabs Dump - So I can catch up later on iOS or PC.\n\n*To PC Now - Similiar to \"Tabs Dump\", but especially when I'd like to download images at high frequency.\n\n\nActually, it's not only for images, but other files as well, if Safari can have their url (with file extension) in the address bar somehow.\nView Bookmarks on desktop\nOn Windows PC, I use iCloud and iCloud bookmark for Firefox. It will sync bookmarks between Firefox and iOS, and thus PC can view images' urls I have bookmarked in Safari. I'm sure it can be done between Google Chrome browsers on both PC and iOS as well, but I haven't tried.\nAutomatic download\nI use a batch file running with aria2c that can download images from urls in a text file.\nAn example of such setup for aria2c is:\n\n\n*\n\n*aria2c.exe (I suppose you have downloaded it)\n\n*results.log (empty)\n\n*urls.txt (empty)\n\n*download.bat\n\n\nAll of these files are under \\aria2c\\ folder.\nA batch file (download.bat) containing (personal information removed and replaced with [user]):\n@echo off\ncd /d %~dp0\necho  ^>^> aria2\necho      Downloading . . .\naria2c.exe --async-dns=false --load-cookies=\"C:\\Users\\[user]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\[user]\\cookies.sqlite\" --max-concurrent-downloads=5 --auto-file-renaming=false --check-certificate=false -d \"%~dp0..\\Import\" -i urls.txt > results.log\necho      Download done.\necho.\npause\n\n--load-cookies= is optional; necessary for viewing images that require HTTP cookie. Remove it when you don't feel like it.\nJust select all and copy images' urls from Firefox (or Chrome?) bookmark, paste them into urls.txt, and then let batch file do the job.\nReview and organize\nReview what it has downloaded in results.log whenever needed.\nThe only disadvantage with \"bookmark to download later\" is when an image has been removed from website (or url address has been changed?) before aria2c has a chance to download it, so be sure to use aria2c more frequently, or in case of url address changed, you can probably try to recall and revisit where you have bookmarked based on url (unlike local directories that every other images will have) with ERR and 0B/s you find within \"Download Results\" section in results.log.\nEverything it has downloaded will be in \\Import\\ folder along with \\aria2c\\ folder. You can organize them through the use with batch file or organize them by yourself.\nPC <-> iOS\nTo copy and view them on iOS, I recommend you have a file management tool for PC <-> iOS, such as iFunBox, 25PP (25PP for me personally), etc (possibly iTunes...?), and a file manager app for iOS such as Readdle's Documents 5.\nConclusion\nI know it may sound bit complicated but I've gotten used to it. It will feel more convenient over time, at least it did for me.\nSo it's all point to PC, right? In the end, it's a fully functional computer that can do a lot more things, after all. iOS and Android are not. Use your iPad's bookmark to download something later when you don't feel like using your PC for a while.\n", "Q: Do you have to keep Bluetooth on to scan for Bluetooth Low Energy devices?

The way I formatted it was:\nsudo mkudffs --media-type=hd --vid=myDisk --blocksize=2048 /dev/sdc\n\n\nThis UDF partition on your external disk would not be readable by any non-Linux system. Requirement of UDF filesystem is that disk's logical block size must match UDF filesystem block size.\nAll hard disks and SSD, including external disks have logical block size of 512 bytes. Note that new disks have physical block size of 4096 bytes, but here is  relevant just logical. CD/DVD/BD optical discs have logical block size of 2048 bytes, so you probably thought that settings for optical discs would work also for hard disks...\n\nSo first problem is that it doesn't recognize the TYPE NAME is defined in format option (--vid=myDisk).\n\nVolume label for UDF filesystem is defined by Logical Volume Identifier which is configured by --lvid option in mkudffs.\nWhat you need is to re-format your disk again with correct --blocksize and ideally specify also --lvid for label.\nNew version 2.0 of mkudffs now automatically set --blocksize to the logical block size. And it also supports option --label which sets correct parameters for volume label.\nFor more information about compatibility of UDF, mkudffs and other operating systems looks into mkudffs 2.0+ manpage into section COMPATIBILITY and BLOCK SIZE.\nSummary:\nTo format hard disk correctly with mkudffs prior to 1.1 you should do:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=1M count=10\nsudo mkudffs --blocksize=512 --lvid=\"label\" --vid=\"label\" /dev/sdc\n\nWith mkudffs version 1.1+ you should just do:\nsudo mkudffs --label=\"label\" /dev/sdc\n\nIf you want your hard disk to be readable also by Windows systems then you need to use at least mkudffs version 2.0.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 17\" Thunderbolt won't output to LCD I have a Macbook Pro 17-inch Early-2011 model.

I've got a new 2013 MacBook Air 13\", with Intel HD Graphics 5000, and it came with a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter within the box. A mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter is also available from Apple.\nAn ASUS PB278Q 27\" 5ms WQHD (2560 x 1440) only gets 1920x1080 resolution using the VGA adapter. I'm not aware of VGA being limited to 1080p, and this is not advertised at all anywhere on the ordering page.\nAs per Google search of Apple's quite scattered and incomplete docs on the matter, which, in the end, still don't cover all custom-order options provided immediately on the ordering page for a MacBook Air, both VGA and DVI adapters apparently only support up to 1920x1200 resolutions, with dual-link DVI being required for \"resolutions above 1920 x 1200\" (what does this even mean, I'm buying a MacBook Air, what's \"above 1920x1200\"?).  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3382\n\n\n*\n\n*Why resolutions of Mini DisplayPort to VGA and DVI adapters is limited to 1920x1200?\n\n*What is the maximum resolution of Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter as ordered for mid-2013 MacBook Air 13?\n\n*Does Apple's official HDMI adapter, \"Belkin Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter\", support \"resolutions above 1920x1200\"?  Which ones would that be?\n\n*What resolutions would I get with a third-party miniDP to DP cables or adapters, or miniDP to HDMI?\n\nA: You can get full resolution with mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort or mini DisplayPort to Dual-link DVI.  Dual-link DVI supports up to 2560x1600 pixels resolution.  DisplayPort supports that resolution or even higher.\nYou will not get full resolution with mini DisplayPort to DVI.  DVI is limited to 1920x1200 or something similar.  You usually won't get full resolution with mini DisplayPort to VGA.\nI do not know whether you get full resolution with mini DisplayPort to HDMI.  I think it depends upon your graphics card.\nBottom line. I would recommend using mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort.\n\nA: You should connect the monitor through DisplayPort. You will need a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable for this. \nYou will be able to get the full resolution of the display this way. \n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro 15\" with Retina Display and a Seiki 4K monitor.  The monitor works great at 2160x3840 with HDMI plugged into the MacBook Pro's HDMI port.  I bought an Accell Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter (Accell says it works @4K and is compliant with HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.2 high bit rate).  I can only get 1080x1920.\n\nA: You need a Dual DVI adapter to take advantage of the full resolution of your monitor. \nWith a Dual DVI adapter you'll be able to use \"...up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colours\"\n\nA: VGA on the PB278Q is limited to 1080p by the monitor's circuitry (check out the manual).  The higher the resolution on VGA, the better the analog circuitry in the monitor needs to be in order to extract the signal.  Asus bought a cheaper part, because most people aren't trying to use VGA at 2560x1440.\nDVI is limited by its spec to a max of widescreen 16:10 ratio of 2,098 × 1,311 because it just can't signal fast enough.  That's why they recommend dual-link DVI for higher resolutions.  (It goes over a single cable, just means a somewhat pricier cable.)\nHDMI might work for you, but as the manual for the monitor states:\n\nWhile the PB278Q supports up to 2560 x 1440 WQHD resolutions including DVI-dual link, HDMI and DisplayPort, some graphics cards only support up to 1920 x 1200 resolution content transmission via HDMI. Please check with your local distributor or retailer on the hardware limitations of your laptop or desktop.\n\nSince you have a display-port monitor, it's not really worth trying to figure out how the adapters work.  As Nicolás Kim suggests, get a mini-Display Port to Display Port cable, and it'll work perfectly.\n\nA: I have a Macbook Air 13 (Early 2014) and have bought the Dell U3415W display which has a native resolution of 3440x1440.\nI could connect it with the supplied miniDP to DP port in the native resolution (3440x1440) as well as with a Belkin miniDP to HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable in the native resolution.\nI know this does not exactly answer your questions as the resolution is slightly different, but it does prove that with an HDMI adapter (at least with the Belkin one) the resolution is definitely not limited to 1080p (1920x1080) as I am able to get 3440x1440 out of it.\n\nA: Here is my configuration:\n15\" 2014 Macbook Pro Retina\nApple 27\" Thunderbolt display\nASUS PB287Q (4k 28\" ASUS monitor)\nAm only able to get full 4K resolution (3840x2160) by using the HDMI connection directly out of the MBP.  Tried Thunderbolt/mini displayport to HDMI adapter and was only able to get 1080p on the ASUS while getting full resolution on the Thunderbolt.\nSummary:\nMy experience shows mini displayport to HDMI only gets 1080p (when a Thunderbolt display is included)\nWas able to get full 4K when connecting mini displayport to displayport with ONLY the ASUS PB287Q attached (i.e. no Thunderbolt)\nAlso spoke with Apple Support to verify and they confirmed that in my configuration (w/ the Thunderbolt) I would only be able to get full 4K via HDMI. Mini displayport to displayport gave me a black screen on ASUS when Thunderbolt was attached as well.\nThe ASUS PB287Q has 2 HDMI and one full displayport, no DVI (likely because it is 4K monitor) so I can't give any details on DVI, VGA or dual-link DVI.\n\nA: Natively, display port uses 3.3 volts to carry the signal.  DVI uses 5 volts.  If your display port supports \"Dual Mode\" or \"DisplayPort++\" it will automatically switch over to use 5 volts if it notices that the other end of the wire is hooked up to a DVI or HDMI port.  When it does this, it is limited at 1920x1200.  \nIn order to convert this signal to DVI/HDMI at higher resolutions than that, you're going to need an active, powered adapter, like this one, that actually processes the signal rather than just connecting it along to the right pins.\n", "Q: Launching certain programs on startup in their own fullscreen space When I login I want a blank desktop in my first space, sublime text in my second space, chrome in my third, and terminal in my fourth space like so:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to you second desktop\n\n*Right click the Sublime Text icon on your dock\n\n*Go to Options > Open at Login\n\n*Right click the Sublime icon again\n\n*Go to Options > Assign to: This Desktop\n\n\nDo the same for every app you want to open at login on the appropriate desktop.\n", "Q: Mac Calendar does not sync to google - error CalDAVMoveEntityQueueableOperation I have setup my calendar (Mountain Lion) to sync with google calendar, and it loads all items in without problems.

I backed-up my mac, then I decided to format it. After recovering my photos from the backed-up library, the pictures are all messed up - not in the right order and some are missing/corrupted.\nIs there something I can do to recover well my pictures?\nthank you\n\nA: Worth saying that if iPhoto is open when Time Machine is trying to do a backup it won't back up the iPhoto Library properly as iPhoto keeps a hold on some of the library. We discovered this the hard way when one of our Mac's that was used primarily for pictures developed two hard drive faults within a couple of weeks and we lost a whole load of pictures because Time Machine had not done a complete backup.\nIn order to ensure that you get a complete backup from Time Machine you need to make sure all your apps are closed at least from time to time.\n\nA: Agree with @Buscar. You need to specify how you backed up and and how you got them back.\nFrom question I guess that they were using iPhoto or Aperture to manage your pictures.   I would guess that you dragged just the directories containing the pictures from the the backup drive back into the Application.   If you to this you are actually loosing all your organization as you are reimporting them.  You will have originals mixed with previews and edits all in one.\nTo Resolve.  Find the backup of the complete package.   It will be something like iPhoto Library or Aperture Library.   If you open those with the respective application you should have everything as at the time that you backed it up.\n\nA: If your pictures were stored in iPhoto, you can access them directly through Finder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click your iPhoto Library file in Finder\n\n*Select \"Show package contents\"\n\n*Select \"Original\"\n\n\nAll your original files should be there. Copy them elsewhere (ex: your Desktop) then reimport them in a new library.\nHint: to create a new iPhoto library and start fresh, start iPhoto by holding down the Option key.

When Apple introduced the iPhone 4 there where many mobile providers that didn't have micro sim's available so at that time I cut one with a sim card cutter into micro format. Since then I'm using this sim card. Now I borrowed this card to a friend for activating his refurbished iPhone 4, however the iPhone couldn't activate and always fell back to the setup screen. Now at the genius bar the blame the sim card. When I put this card in other iPhones it works perfect. \nIs it really possible that an iPhone gets damaged by a sim card in this way ? \nAt the same time I heard from somebody that iPhone 4 have often issues with the sim tray overheating.\n\nA: An iPhone that is failing activation certainly sounds like a self-cut SIM card could be a problem. \nThere's an easy way to tell, however: take someone else's non-cut SIM card and see what happens. If it works, the SIM card is at fault. If it doesn't work, the phone is at fault.\n", "Q: How does iBooks determine the category of an EPUB? I've been using the Perl module EBook::EPUB to create ebooks to read in iBooks.  But I can't figure out how to set a category for the books I create.\nWhen I sort by categories in iBooks, it doesn't seem to do anything.  As I understand it, that should show each category as a heading with those books listed underneath it.  But it seems my books don't have categories.\nHow do I set a category when creating an EPUB book?\n\nA: You can set the category in iTunes, using the info window (Cmd - i). No need to use Calibre.\n\nA: and the mighty Google said:\nThe ePub eBooks Metadata Mess!\nBasically you will need a Software called Calibre to set the metadata on eBooks to be able to sort them by category.\nYes, it is FREE !\nHere is a SAMPLE.\n\nNext step:\nGetting eBooks from Calibre to Your Device Using Send to Device and the Connect/Share Functions.\nA special plugboard that you may want to create is a “genre” plugboard that corresponds with a “genre” or “tag” field.  \nUsing this in conjunction with iBooks can sort your books into separate categories on your iOS device.  \nFirst, create a custom field that you will want to use to sort your iBooks. You may generically name it “genre” in case you want to use it for some other purpose otherwise you could name it “ibooks_cat” or something like that.  For column type, select “Text, column show in the tag browser.” As with any new column, you will have to restart calibre.  Go through and mark the books in your library.  Alternatively, you can use the existing “tag” field.  Then create a new plugboard: Format=epub | Device=apple | Source template {#usercolumn} or {tags} | Destination field=tags. Save and then “Apply”.\n\nA: The article that @Buscar's answer points to says that the tags field in calibre maps to the Categories in iBooks.\nLooking at an example in my calibre db this looks like each tag shown in calibre map to a <dc:subject> element in the .opf file in the epub.\ne.g. a Tag of Fiction maps to <dc:subject>Fiction</dc:subject>\nThis element is at the end of the metadata element in the root package element.\nSo I think you need to call the add_subject method on  EBook::EPUB \nLooking at the article it suggests that iBooks reads only one of the tags, which then comparing with the epub spec suggests that iBooks is doing it wrongly. A workround might be to make sure that there is only one subject element in the epub\n", "Q: Out of warranty MBP ,Burned Magsafe port and frayed charger cable - repair option and cost? I have a MBP 15\" 2011 model and has is the burned magsafe port (leftmost pin melted) which i noticed today.\nThe connector gets too hot sometimes ( but remains ok when I charge in sleep mode). Sometimes the charging will stop and LED will become green and then I reconnect it to get it in charging mode.\nThe Frayed cable: very light cut at connector side \n\nand heavily frayed at brick as shown.\n\nSo what should I do now and how much would it cost to repair this? Should I buy a new charger?\nAlso I live at a place where there is no Apple Service Center (nearest one is 300 km away). So, can I use these things as they are for 2 weeks i.e. by charging in sleep mode or when the port doesn't get hot while charging.\n\nA: The MagSafe board is a very easy repair for someone who has patience and a small amount of training fixing any computer at all. The MacBook Pro aren't as fidgety to repair as the iMac and MacBook Air (where I would say you should be a skilled technician with official training materials available to work on them reliably).\n\nYou're looking to replace this with a handful of screws turned.\nGo to iFixit.com and look up the repair guide and parts list for the DC in board and you will know if you have the skills to find the right part, the right tools and the right manual to undertake this work. Otherwise, pay a local technician to do the job/source the parts/give you what they feel is a good guarantee. As for the adapter, buy a new or used one on the aftermarket or from Apple. When the cord is crushed and frayed, it is designed to fail in a way that won't cause a fire hazard. I wouldn't mess with that end of things or with repairing the transformer itself.\n\nA: What do you want us to say ? \nQuestion is why it got that way? \nCan you continue ? well at your own risk, since that could result in a small fire ! \nYou need to find the root cause and fix it.\nYou could order new cable from Amazon have it 1-2 days for about $50, but that does not solve the root cause.\nTake look at what Power adapter you have now, is it 60W or 85 Watt.\nDo some troubleshooting from Apple.\n", "Q: Errors when transferring Time Machine to a new drive I tried transferring my Time Machine volume to a new drive using the instructions provided by Apple, where it requires that I drag-and-drop via the Finder, but I got a ton of errors.

I have transferred a Time Machine drive once before, and it took 24 hours, but there were no errors.\nThere were a lot of \"This operation could not be completed.\" errors. I think the codes were along the lines of -50 and -8300.

I already ran \"Repair disk\" on both the source and destination volumes, with no errors.\n\nA: I am in the same situation: I am trying to move my Time Machine backup from a 1TB LaCie d2 Quadra disk to a new 3TB LaCie Quadra, both on FireWire 800. I have followed the same Apple instructions as you and get a bunch of -50 errors after a while.\nMy current approach is to repartition the new drive and use:\nsudo cp -R /Volumes/OldTimeMachine/Backups.backupdb /Volumes/NewTimeMachine\n\nbut I don’t know if that will copy things correctly. My reading of the man page for cp suggests that it should (this is OS X 10.7.5).\nI found this thread on MacRumors Forum which may explain things, although I am not sure.

This is how I did it.\n\n(13) Permission Denied\nError 13 indicates a filesystem permissions problem. That is, Apache was denied access to a file or directory due to incorrect permissions. It does not, in general, imply a problem in the Apache configuration files.\nIn order to serve files, Apache must have the proper permission granted by the operating system to access those files. In particular, the User or Group specified in httpd.conf must be able to read all files that will be served and search the directory containing those files, along with all parent directories up to the root of the filesystem.\nTypical permissions on a unix-like system for resources not owned by the User or Group specified in httpd.conf would be 644 -rw-r--r-- for ordinary files and 755 drwxr-x-r-x for directories or CGI scripts. You may also need to check extended permissions (such as SELinux permissions) on operating systems that support them.\nIf you are running 2.4, the AH error code may give you more information here.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*AH00132: file permissions deny server access\n  \n*AH00035: access denied because search permissions are missing on a component of the path\n  An Example\n  \n  \n  Lets say that you received the Permission Denied error when accessing the file /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/foo/bar.html on a unix-like system.\nFirst check the existing permissions on the file:\n\ncd /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/foo\nls -l bar.htm\n\n\nFix them if necessary:\n\nchmod 644 bar.html\n\n\nThen do the same for the directory and each parent directory (/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/foo, /usr/local/apache2/htdocs, /usr/local/apache2, /usr/local, /usr):\n\nls -la\nchmod +x .\ncd ..\n# repeat up to the root\n\n\nOn some systems, the utility namei can be used to help find permissions problems by listing the permissions along each component of the path:\nnamei -m /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/foo/bar.html\n  If your system doesn't have namei, you can use parsepath. It can be obtained from here.\nIf all the standard permissions are correct and you still get a Permission Denied error, you should check for extended-permissions. For example you can use the command setenforce 0 to turn off SELinux and check to see if the problem goes away. If so, ls -alZ can be used to view SELinux permission and chcon to fix them.\nIn rare cases, this can be caused by other issues, such as a file permissions problem elsewhere in your apache2.conf file. For example, a WSGIScriptAlias directive not mapping to an actual file. The error message may not be accurate about which file was unreadable.\nDO NOT set files or directories to mode 777, even \"just to test\", even if \"it's just a test server\". The purpose of a test server is to get things right in a safe environment, not to get away with doing it wrong. All it will tell you is if the problem is with files that actually exist.\nCGI scripts\nAlthough the CGI script permission might look correct, the actual binary specified in the shebang might not have the proper permissions to be run.

What it actually means is that httpd has been denied permission to connect to that IP address and port.\nThe most common cause of this is SELinux not permitting httpd to make network connections.\nTo resolve it, you need to change an SELinux boolean value (which will automatically persist across reboots).

No idea why it wasn't working.\nEventually, I just checked the \"shared folder\" checkbox in the Finder for that folder, and it worked, on the specified domain, with php active, the way I wanted it to. :/\n...so that was easy.\n\nA: Step 1: Create a “Sites” directory under /users/USERNAME\nStep 2:\nsudo vi /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\nUncomment the below lines :\nLoadModule authz_core_module libexec/apache2/mod_authz_core.so\nLoadModule authz_host_module libexec/apache2/mod_authz_host.so\nLoadModule userdir_module libexec/apache2/mod_userdir.so\nLoadModule include_module libexec/apache2/mod_include.so\nLoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so\n\nInclude /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf\n\nChange “User” and “Group” to following :\nUser USERNAME\nGroup staff\n\nStep 3: sudo vi /etc/apache2/users/USERNAME.conf\nAdd the below lines :\n<Directory \"/Users/USERNAME/Sites/\">\nAllowOverride All\nOptions Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks\nRequire all granted\n</Directory>\n\nStep 4:\nvi /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf\nUncomment the below line :\nInclude /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf\n\n\nA: I generally fix this by setting the Apache user to myself in local environments and in machines where the only user who uses Apache is me. In /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf, set User to your username from _www, e.g.:\nUser _www\n\n->\nUser joao\n\nAnd then restart Apache:\n$ sudo apachectl restart\n\nAdditional steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have active sessions, they are going to give permission errors since they are still owned by _www. Own them:\n$ sudo chown joao: /var/tmp/sess_*\n\nImplications:\nAfter this, Apache (and PHP et al.) will run as you and will gain read/write permission to all of the files you have read/write permission. But since this is just a local development environment, that shouldn't be a problem unless you have no rules to block Apache in your firewall and let questionable files like file explorers, shells, scripts that may contain vulnerabilities run under Apache; in which case anyone including your public wifi neighbor in a cafe can enter http://<your IP> and do whatever those scripts let them to do.\nIn fact, you should prevent this regardless of the scripts you run or even if you don't set Apache user to yourself since you probably don't want random outsiders to be able to see the contents of your localhost.\nPrevention:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make Apache listen only to localhost. Again, in httpd.conf:\nListen 80\n\n->\nListen 127.0.0.1:80\n\nAnd restart Apache again:\n$ sudo apachectl restart\n\n\n*Disable Apache in the application firewall (note that you may have already disabled it if you clicked Deny if/when it was asked during the first time you run Apache):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences » Security & Privacy » Firewall.\n\n*Click the lock icon to the lower left and enter your password if needed.\n\n*Turn the firewall on if it's disabled.\n\n*Click Firewall Options.\n\n*Click the + button.\n\n*Hit cmd ⌘ + ⇧ shift + G and enter /usr/sbin/httpd and click Add (If httpd doesn't show up there, you can look for it in the terminal by which httpd)\n\n*In the list click httpd and select Block incoming connections.\n\n*Hit OK.\n\n*Reload the firewall:\n$ launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.alf.useragent.plist\n$ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.alf.agent.plist\n$ launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.alf.useragent.plist\n$ sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.alf.agent.plist\n\n\n\n*Restrict PHP to the document root.

OP reports getting a 403 Forbidden error when accessing localhost.\nAn article at coolestguidesontheplanet describes how setting up virtual hosts in Apache causes \"Losing Localhost\". In other words, the root cause of the OP's problem might be an incomplete enabling of vhosts. \n\n\"Once [virtual hosts are] set up, you lose your older document root\n  previously at /Library/WebServer/Documents or accessed in the browser\n  at http://localhost -- you get a 403 Forbidden Error.\"\n\nThe article goes on to explain how to fix localhost in a vhost environment. \nAdd these lines to file /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf:\n\n   <VirtualHost *:80> \n   ServerName localhost \n   DocumentRoot /Library/WebServer/Documents/ \n   </VirtualHost>\n\nIt also explains how to fix \"permissions issues with things like updates and authentication\" associated with \"using the Users/username/Sites folder for vhosts\".\nInstead of using the default UID _www, use your own User and Group.\n\nIn the terminal, enter command \n\n    id\n\nFind your UID and GID. \nUpdate file httpd.conf\nIn section <IfModule unixd_module>\nChange User and Group to your local UID and GID.\n\nhttps://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/set-virtual-hosts-apache-mac-osx-10-10-yosemite/\n\nA: I am working in a MacOS 10.15.4 environment with a /Sites folder migrated from a much older Mac.  I used the instructions from etresoft to set up my server.\nEverything followed well until I reached the point \"It Works!\" In the following step I received the same HTTP Error Code that you do -- namely, 403.  This problems was fixed by changing the values of the User and Group directives in the /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf file from _www to those of my /Sites folder:\nUser username\nGroup staff\nAfter making these two very important edits, I made sure that the permissions for all of my folders and files were set to read and write -- namely, 755 and 644 respectively, and applied the sudo apachectl restart command.  Setting the permissions for your /Sites folder content can be easily achieved in the GetInfo panel of the /Sites folder.  Unlock the panel and look for the gear-icon.\nMy /Sites folder is now available as a browsable website with PHP functionality.  I simply enter localhost/~username/ in my browser window and click return.  From there on it is just a matter of setting the proper path to your content.\nWell, it worked for me. Maybe it can work for you.\n\nA: I was using ACL's to set permissions, following the instructions in \"How to Set File and Directory Permissions for Apache on Mac OS X\", but still getting:\n[Wed Feb 12 15:43:51 2014] [error] [client ::1] (13)Permission denied: access to /trace/trace.php denied (filesystem path '/Library/WebServer/Documents/trace/trace.php') because search permissions are missing on a component of the path\n\nThen I read \"(13) Permission Denied\" (linked to in João Ramos's answer) and tried adding \"execute\" to the ACL. That worked.\n\nA: Restart your computer! This worked for me. \nBut first of all I had changed the user under apache to myself (from _www), since it is a local/test environment. So ultimately it has something to do with permissions.\nThen restart the machine, just like Windows ;).\n\nA: A simple chmod in a sub-folder of the document root solved the access problem for me in a standard macOS Sites folder setup.

Now, when syncing/idling, the battery reports an insanely great remaining time.\nIf you have the latest Dropbox version, I'd suggest searching for other rogue processes that could drain your battery.\n", "Q: how to route traffic to other computer via firewire, everything else via wifi I have two macbook pros connected via firewire.\nBoth are also connected to wifi.\nHow can I check that traffic between the two computers is going preferentially via firewire, but everything else goes via wifi?\n\nA: You will need to control this using network routing.\nIf you assign an IP address on a different subnet as the WiFi to both computers on the FireWire link - you will ensure that traffic between the two computers will be restricted to the wired network.\nYou can see the network routing tables by opening the Network Utility and you can control the IP address of both firewire interfaces using the normal network preference pane.\n", "Q: How can I change OS X Double-Click on Title Bar to be like Windows? I love my Mac eternally but there is one thing I miss from my former Windows days. When I want to toggle between maximize and restore window, on Windows I would double-click the title bar, and that would invoke the toggle.\nHowever with older versions of OS X, a double click on the title bar causes the window to minimize, forcing me to hit F10, then locate the minimized window, then click on it. Too many steps.\nIs there any way to make OS X perform the toggle on double-click?\n\nA: *\n\n*Choose Apple Menu → System Preferences, then click Dock.\n\n\n*Select check box Double-click a window’s title bar to zoom.\n\n\n\n*Double click on window's title bar to maximise the window.\nZoom expands a window to fill the space between the Dock and the menu bar. If the Dock is along the side of the screen, the window fills the space below the menu bar and to the side of the Dock.\n\nUp to macOS High Sierra 10.14:\nPerform steps 1 and 2, then Shift + Double click on title bar to maximise the window.\n\nA: You can do it with third-party software\nBetterSnapTool\nApp Store ($1.99)\n\n\nA: I didn't find anything that makes double click to maximize available, but I found using http://hyperdock.bahoom.com/ a good alternative. (It also gives you active windows preview in your dock on top of window management.)\n\nHyperDock brings advanced window management features to Mac OS:\nMove & resize windows just by holding down keys and/or moving your mouse.\nAutomatically resize windows when dragging to screen edges (Window Snapping).\n\nBy default you can snap window to sides/maximize with ctrl + cmd + arrow keys.\n\nI also found a better alternative (even more convenient than the Windows feature you were asking about): Better Touch Tool from http://www.boastr.de/ (free)\nAdd your custom gesture like this (actually you can choose among tons of predefined actions and bind them to key combinations/ trackpad gestures):\n\n\nA: Go to Apple icon > System Preferences > Dock > Select \"Double-click a window's title bar to\" \"Zoom\", then it should work. As of now yours is minimize.\n\nA: If you move the cursor to a corner of the window (until ↔ appears) and double click, it will expand in that direction. Not a 100% solution, but still good.\n\nA: Moom and SizeUp allow setting up keyboard shortcuts for maximizing and restoring windows:\n\n\nI never minimize windows, and I don't use any window management applications either. I think it's easier to just use ⌘H and to focus applications with keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: On Big Sur, I had to re-enable the System Preferences > Dock > Select \"Double-click a window's title bar to\" \"Zoom\" option.\nI.e. Uncheck > Check\n\n\nA: Shift + Dbl-Click works perfectly!\n\nA: UPDATE 2022\nFor macos mojave and later -\nOne can click on the arrow that pops up on the corner of the window and then use option-double click to maximise it.\n\nA: I found Spectacle to be a great free tool for a lot of things \"window resizing\" - works like magic! \n\n", "Q: How to edit the metadata information displayed by mdls from CLI?

I find that many of the kernel extensions in /System/Library/Extensions are inapplicable to my MacBook, such as extensions for fibre channel cards, firewire, graphics cards I don't have, etc. Is there any benefit (in boot time, RAM footprint, etc.) to deleting these unneeded extensions?\n\nA: Probably there is a benefit in boot up time. \n\n\n*\n\n*First I would record the current boot up time (it is reported in the Console).\n\n*Next I would make sure to know what I am doing…\nTo delete actively loaded .kext,  I recommended to find which ones are actually loaded.\n\n\n*\n\n*I suggest getting an app called Kext Wizard.\n\n\n\nThis will tell you exactly what is loaded, rather than just using the list from System Information. System Information might not give you everything, and Kext Wizard could find others that were loaded. \n\nA: Actually, any difference in boot up time would be negligible - OS X doesn't boot /mach_kernel — it boots the kernel cache (/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/Startup/kernelcache), which already has the kexts you are using. This gets rebuilt if /System/Library/Extensions gets modified (or if you touch(1) it deliberately). \nIn terms of the filesystem space, as of Snow Leopard, everything is compressed. Meaning you're not really wasting too much space, either. \nThere is a downside, however — if you delete kexts, even with kext wizard, or whichever utility, there is a remote chance that some kext will be loaded on demand (e.g. via IOKit probing, on some USB device, for example). In this case, a kext might not be found - and you lose a driver.\nIn short, if it ain't broken, don't fix it. Leave /System/Library/Extensions intact. \n\nA: While I would in general not remove anything in /System/Library/Extensions, I would consider uninstalling 3rd-party products that include a kext before doing an OS upgrade.  The upgrade process seems to find and move out of the way most incompatible kexts (and those that were added in /System/Library/Extensions when they should have been in /Library/Extensions), but it's not perfect, and those can make the upgrade difficult or unstable to the point of needing to do a clean OS install and subsequent reload of apps and user data.  Assuming one still wants the 3rd-party product, and did one's research to know that the new OS version was supported, one could always re-install it after the upgrade.  Even more than usual, for such situations it's very wise to have a test system (or a spare disk and a lot of available downtime), since additional surprises could be expected that delay the desired end state.\nRigorous configuration control will avoid most of that; but for those that tend to test a lot of different software, install almost anything reputable, and not get rid of it once it has no further benefit, the accumulation can quickly reach a point where the expected painlessness of all things Apple vanishes entirely.\n\nA: All highly suspect.

There are lots of apps which I would like to have and lots of apps which I wouldn't like to have. Also like games with levels etc. do you start from THAT level or from the beginning? E.G simsfreeplay I use icloud to back up this game can I download it on another device (same app) but with the same id?!\n\nA: Yes, you can absolutely have multiple devices using the same Apple ID and have different apps and the same apps installed on them. What apps are installed on each device is managed by the individual device and/or by iTunes when you sync.\nThere are not many games or apps that allow for sync'ng across multiple devices though, so for most apps the content will be unique to each device. Hopefully the developers will catch on that many of us are using their apps on iPhones and iPads and get them to sync.\n", "Q: Deleting emails across my Apple devices How can I sync deleting my emails across Macbook Ipad & iPhone ?\n\nA: This function doesn't exist in iCloud which does syncing across iOS and Apple products. You would need to set up something like an MDM solution like the Casper suite to automate this. \n", "Q: Does iTunes have a limit on the number of movies it can list? I have a very annoying problem. Using HandBrake I have been able to rip and hereafter metatag all the family's 1500 movies for our iTunes library.\nOnce, I couldn't find the movie I was looking for, even though I knew it was tagged and stored. I also knew that it has been watched before through the Apple TV.\nI went to our iTunes Application and saw that only 814 movies were shown. (That's what it said in the bottom) I got afraid that all my movies were gone, but after looking in the files folder, I realized that all movies actually still existed. I tried to import some of the movies again and iTunes actually showed them, but then some of the existing movies disappeared. Still only 814 movies.\nMy question is: Does iTunes have a limit for the amount of movies able to list in the application? I know it can't be about RAM and HDD since there is about 1,5 TB HDD left and the computer has 16 GB RAM.. \nI also tried to update the iTunes version, but it didn't seem to work.. Any suggestions?\nEDIT:\nJust to inform you.. I am able to continue importing music and tv-shows without problems.\n\nA: Be careful about creating a new library - make sure you have a backup first of the Library files first!\nI've \"lost\" things in iTunes too.  Try creating a new playlist, and drag one of the missing movie files from the Finder right into the new playlist.  Even if it's already in iTunes, this will add it to the playlist.  If it's not in iTunes, this will add it to the Library and the playlist.\nIf it shows up in the playlist, but it's still not in the Movies section, check the \"Media Kind\" value on the Get Info -> Options tab.  Make sure it's set to \"Movie\", not \"Home Video\" or something else.\nIf it can't be added to the playlist at all (and really isn't somewhere else in iTunes already), it's probably in a format that iTunes doesn't support.  I know you said most of the HB-encoded movies are there, but that doesn't mean that some of them aren't somehow encoded (or maybe tagged) differently, and iTunes is choking on that.  Check the encoding settings carefully in QuickTime and VLC, and the tags in MetaX or the equivalent.\n\nA: Make sure when tagging your files you are setting them to video type \"Movie\". Some tagging programs default to \"Home Movie\". I couldn't figure out why several of my movies were missing then I realized that I accidentally had them tagged as Home Movie.\n\nA: I would begin with resetting the iTunes Cache to clear it from possible problems.\nWhen opening iTunes library, open the Activity Monitor and look the load on your RAM and the Disk information.\nThere should not be a limit in iTunes on how many files you can have.\nBut just in case:\nHold the ⌥ alt key and start iTunes. It will ask you if you want to create new library:\n\nRead these detailed instructions for more information about this.\n", "Q: Retrieve email error message on iphone 3gs Verified and re-verified mail settings on iphone3gs but when I try to retrieve emails from my external email account an error message appears saying 'the server is not responding. check settings'. When I called server they said it's an Apple issue. Doesn't sound correct. Any ideas?\n\nA: Since you did NOT specify the email type (server) lets use some generic methods to find out if the server is responding.\nYou can use something called \n\nPing\n\nan IP address or hostname in the Terminal for Mac OS X\nWhat Ping does is it send a signal to the server (IP address) and check for respond. So if the server is alive it will respond. That will however not say if they have specific problem on the server.\nTo do that open your Terminal in Utilities.\nType: \n\nping [-Options] ip or hostname\n\nUsage: Ping's an IP-address or a hostname (which can be used to troubleshoot connection problems to another computer or a server).\nOptions\n-c (num)    Stop after sending and receiving  number of packets.\n-f  Flood ping: Flood ping, output packets as fast as they come back or 100 times per second.\n-i     Wait for  seconds between sending each packet.\nExample\nping 127.0.0.1  Ping your own computer (localhost)\nping -c 10 google.se    Ping google.se and stop after 10 sent and received packages.\nQuick tip: If you're using ping and the response keeps coming in without stopping. Hold down \"Ctrl\" and hit \"Z\" (Ctrl+Z) to abort. \n", "Q: Where is the unavailable disk space? \nI recently uninstalled a 120 GB windows 7 (installed and uninstalled via boot camp) on my Mac mini machine.

I know that the operating system itself uses space, but I very much doubt that it is that much.\n\nA: It looks like uninstalling Windows via bootcamp did not merge the space reclaimed by removing the old windows partition into your Macintosh HD one. In order to do that you can use the Disk Utility.\nYou can simply drag your Macintosh HD partition bigger and apply it. Here is a tutorial on how to resize partitions with Disk Utility\n", "Q: Mac Pro 10.7 - aftermarket dvd drive hangs on restart Drive works fine, but on restart or after a required restart from app installation - the OS looks for CD in drive. Mac will not get to the login screen. It hangs and i can see a green light on dvd drive flashes every couple of seconds. If i shutdown, then start up - no issues. Drive is LG GH22LP21 - Mac Pro 10.7.5 2x2.66 Xenon\n\nA: Master / Slave?\nThis is in the top bay?  And nothing is in the bottom?  There is probably a jumper to choose Master or Slave for the drive.  If it is the only one, it should be Master.  \n", "Q: Pages: Linked columns In Pages, I want to write a document that has two columns: One for the main text, and the other for annotations.\nFor example: Say I write a paragraph in the main text talking about the many varieties of poodles, and which of them have ever turned vigilante, worn Luchador masks, and roamed the country in a '67 Chevy dispensing justice. Then of course I'd need to have a summary in the side column referring the reader to the primary sources in the literature.\nFirst issue, is that pages doesn't keep the two columns separate: Once you've filled a page's leftmore column, it scrolls into the right. I want it to scroll to the next page.\nIssue two is that even if I manually force the text to line up, using carriage returns to get annotations to line up with primary text, any little change could screw up the formatting of every following page. I want it to be such that I can write an annotation in the right column, and pin it to an invisible anchor in the left column, so it will try to follow that text.\nHow would you accomplish this?\n\nA: Pages is not at all set up to do what you ask. The layout in iBooks author is superior to Pages, but you can't easily share that work across platforms and until the next versions of Apple OS ship (presumably in the fall of 2013) - iBooks author lets you design on Mac only and read on iPad only.\nThe text in multiple columns flows from the bottom of one column and up into the next. Additions and deletions will not align well unless you use a table structure to hold paragraphs and enforce the right-left constraint so that one comment isn't higher or lower vertically than the text for which it corresponds.\n\nHopefully tables works for you, as your other option in Pages is to use the comments or track changes feature to anchor some amount of text to another specific portion of text. These items do print nicely, and you might find you can use the whole width of your page and let the software reduce things to fit as needed.\n\n", "Q: Cannot Connect to internal IP addresses My OSX 10.8 machine can no longer reach several machines on my home network's internal IP range.

Unless the programmer has considered that this error could happen and writes code to handle those exact errors, the kernel is the last line of defense and it has told you it's giving up and dumping information an engineer might be able to use to debug the problem.\nIf I was that engineer, I would notice that spotlight's mdworker process might have been the last one in the vicinity where the crash was logged and that the last change to the kernel was unloading MSDOS extension, so I would ask you if you have any PC drives connected or ejecting and if this crash was actually within 8 minutes (505 seconds) from the time the Mac was started.\nAnother high level analogy is if your car stalls, try starting it up again. Only if it's stalling in a repeated way or you have other needs (like you're driving the president around) would you try to fix it yourself or hire a team of engineers to know what to do. In your case, we would need to know a lot about what you have connected to the Mac, if you can boot from a clean install of the OS, if you have expertise or time to troubleshoot this or if you just want assurance on what to do next.\nFrom a user level perspective, here are tips you can take to know how to handle them:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X: About kernel panics  - http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3742\nFeel free to ask a follow on question if you have more context to this one panic dump or have questions how to use the article above to solve your dilemma.\nWe also have a few threads that might help you narrow down some options:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Mountain Lion - Kernel Panic and Restart after Sleep\n\n*How to debug and solve an OS X 10.8 kernel panic which appears quite often, sometimes twice a day?\n\n*computer sleeps, then crashes later\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina 15'' - High CPU temperature I've seen a few similar questions on here but none seem to have a good answer, nor seeing the temperature levels I'm seeing. \nNotebook is only a month old and just installed iStat Menus and noticed that the \"CPU Die - Digital\" sensor temperature is consistently over 80℃.\nCurrently it is 96℃ with the CPU at 85% idle, all load averages of 2.3.\nThe lowest I've managed to get it is 49℃ by killing almost everything running. The highest is 103℃, by booting multiple virtual machines. From what I've read, this is 2℃ off the shutdown temperature for the CPUs… and the fans were only running at 3800/4000.\nSo, is this normal? Have I got a dud MacBook or is iStat Menus to blame?\nCan't seem to find out how to read the sensors via command line.\n\n\n\nA: Lets me try to help you to understand what is going on here:\nAny third party software uses the already available information from your Mac as designed by Apple that uses thermal diodes attached to different points in the system. Apple has done a lots of work to correctly manage the thermal load already.\nThe coding and the mathematics to covert the given information correctly in to the Temperature readings outputs by third party software could be tricky, so use it with grain of slat, since it varies a lot from Hardware (diode) + EFI + CPU types from system to system. In English, the third party software's are not always calibrated for your specific system.\nNote from Intel:\n\nIntel® Processors have built-in thermal protection. If the processor\n  gets too hot, the built-in protection shuts down the computer. If your\n  computer is not over-clocked and is running under the design\n  specifications, the built-protection can help prevent damage to your\n  system.\n\nHigh Temperature readings:\nIf you use a third party software to measure the temperature or the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) readings, contact the software vendor to ensure the software is validated to work with your processor. \nIf you still want to know more or you see weird Temperature reading, please go to Intel web site and look for your specific CPU specifications. It can not be hotter outside then inside since the CPU is the source of heat, otherwise your computer will just shut down initiated by Intel's CPU internal protection. \nHowever, if that happens (the shutdown by the CPU), then you need to repair your cooling system (fans + heatsinks ect.)\nSo I just looked up at Intel for my Intel Core i5 (1.8 Ghz)\nand it shows Maximum temp to be 105 Degree Celsius and it has the build in thermal protection.\n\n\n\nA: Those temperatures sound fairly normal to me. My 2009-era MacBook Pro typically runs around 80°C and tops 100°C when it's working hard. \n\n\nA: I have installed Mac Fan Control and set fans to start when CPU Diode temp is at 60. I think it helps a bit.\n", "Q: How can I uninstall the macports tex packages?

    tex/xindy\n\nDoes this mean I should execute \"port uninstall\" for each one of the above lines?\n\nA: First of all, port list shows all packages that are known to MacPorts. To get a list of packages that are actually installed, use port installed. Slower but with a few more details: port list installed.\nAs for your actual problem: Maybe the reason why uninstalling \"texlive\" produces no output is because the package is not installed in the first place. Try to determine a concrete binary that is interfering with MacTex and that you want to get rid of. Then determine the MacPorts package to uninstall with this command: port provides /path/to/file.\n\nA: I was trying to solve the same problem because I have a working MacTeX install, but then macports installed texlive as a dependency (for auctex).  Mark's comment,\n\nYes, or perhaps put the MacTex path ahead on your $PATH,\n\nprompted me to check, and sure enough, the MacTeX path was totally absent.  I have simply put it on the front of my $PATH variable and things now work as before.  I'll deal with that extra texlive installation some other time :p.\nIn terminal do \ncd /usr/local/texlive\n\nand then ls (list the directory) and such to follow the directories until you find your texlive binaries (e.g. latex, pdftex, etc).  Once you find the full path to them you can add them to your bash profile (see below).\nPut something like this into your ~/.bash_profile file BELOW any changes made by MacPorts texlive.\nexport PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-darwin:$PATH\n\n\nA: \nsudo port uninstall --follow-dependents texlive-bin\n\nThis should do it. Just in case, do the same for texlive-common.\n", "Q: Safari window always highlight Is there a way to have a Safari window (or just a tab) always highlighted?\nI mean, when using other programs, have a piece of screen occupied by a Safari window (resized, obviously).\n\nA: You could use Fluid or Afloat:\n\n\n", "Q: How do I remove a shared photostream from only one device? I want to remove a photostream I'm subscribed to on one device to save space but I want to keep it on my other devices. How do I do that?\n\nA: You don't have control to allow only a subset of the photo stream to come to a particular device.\nPhotostream takes photos from all devices that feed it, and as it's a store that Apple keeps online, if a particular device subscribes to the stream, it gets a cached copy of all messages.\nYou can take that device out of the stream temporarily or free up other space on the device to allow the stream contents to be cached locally.\nIn your specific case, you could exit that stream subscription to clear the space and then have the person that owns the stream re-send it to you once you've gotten space freed up on some or all devices that need to subscribe to your collective stream.\n", "Q: Outline of changes to the iOS Developer Program License Agreement From time to time Apple updates their iOS Developer Program License Agreement, but, unfortunately, they never provide any clues as to what they changed since the previous version of the agreement. This means that after each change I need to read through the entire agreement and hope that I catch any of the new stuff they introduced.\nDo you know of any place where a summary of the changes between versions of the agreement is presented (possibly somewhere on one of Apple's sites and I just missed it)?\nAn alternative might be an application that provides a visual difference between two PDF documents. I tried out DiffPDF, but it turned out that this app is not sophisticated enough to handle the accumulating changes after a few pages. If you have a different suggestion it would be welcome.\n\nA: There is a very nice site that publicly calls out changes to Apple's developer terms.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.appstorereviewguidelineshistory.com\nBefore them, I've not seen anyone that provides these publicly, so I've resorted to saving the PDF to a folder every time I'm prompted that there is a change. I just append the YYYYmmDD of the agreement to the file name so I can see where exactly the agreement with Apple is changing.\nFrom there, a tool like Kaleidoscope can run a graphical diff on the text if you copy it into a TextEdit document or otherwise get the content out of it's PDF container. Preview will allow you to copy all the text and paste it into a Text Edit document, but I also have a Folder Action created in Automator to convert any PDF file dropped into it's folder into a rich text file and dump the result on my Desktop.\n\nA: The http://www.appstorereviewguidelineshistory.com is for review guidelines, \nnot for the iOS Developer Program License Agreement\nTry this: https://www.diffchecker.com/8cxz8j14\n\nA: Export the PDFs to MS Word, then use Review/Compare to see the differences.\n", "Q: Can the 2009 Mac mini work with its optical drive removed? I wonder if the Mac mini 2009 needs the optical drive for work, or if I can just remove it?\nI don't need it at all and have an external drive just in case. I will replace the HDD with an SSD and want to keep the Mac cool and lower the energy consumption as much as possible.\n\nA: No it does not. Many have swapped out their internal DVD-ROMs on favor of installing another bay that can handle an HDD/SSD.\nHere's an example of an optical to HDD bay: http://www.ifixit.com/Apple-Parts/12-7-mm-SATA-Optical-Bay-SATA-Hard-Drive-Enclosure/IF107-081\n", "Q: screen on my MacBook Pro goes completely black after I log in I was fixing my Mac partition by rebooting and holding CMD+S and then typing \nfsck -fy\n\nIt found some issues and (probably) fixed them.\nNow when I boot into MacOS after some time the screen goes black and there is no way to do anything except put it to sleep.

The following Applescript opens a menubar app called QuickHue and then clicks a specified item in the menu.  Often, when I use the applescript, it does nothing.  But if I wait a moment or two and try again, it works perfectly.  And it keeps working.  But if some time passes and I trigger it again, it'll fail again the first time.  After that, it works like a champ.  Here's the applescript.  Any idea what's going on here?\nignoring application responses\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"QuickHue\"\n        click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n    end tell\nend ignoring\ndo shell script \"killall System\\\\ Events\"\ndelay 0.1\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"QuickHue\"\n    tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n        click menu item 2 of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: You're right, I didn't test it well enough. The error was shown when System Events was not already running. As another workaround, I added launch application \"System Events\" and delay 0.2 to the start:\nlaunch application \"System Events\"\ndelay 0.2\nignoring application responses\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"QuickHue\"\n        click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n    end tell\nend ignoring\ndo shell script \"killall System\\\\ Events\"\ndelay 0.1\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"QuickHue\"\n    tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n        click menu item 2 of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nIf it still doesn't work, try increasing the delays.\n\nA: Perhaps you can write a loop that keeps track of whether or not the script has succeeded and keeps trying until it has (or some cutoff amount of time has passed).  If indeed the problem is that system events is not fully started up, then the loop could ask system events if the application system events is running.  Here's a simple function you could use:\non appIsRunning(appName)\n    tell application \"System Events\" to (name of processes) contains appName\nend appIsRunning\n\nJust to be sure it has started up fully, you could implement your delay after the loop.\nHere's what the loop function would look like:\non startApp(appName)\n    set IsRunning to false\n    set tries to 20\n    repeat until (IsRunning is true or tries is 0)\n        set IsRunning to appIsRunning(appName)\n        set tries to (tries - 1)\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\nend startApp\n\nOr, maybe you have some other way of determining the successful running of the script… is there some state you can check to determine success?  If so, you could loop until that condition is met instead of on whether System Events has started up.\nAnother thing is, I don't know if system events has to \"register\" with applescript before an applescript fires off in order for it to work.  If it does, then you might try this: you can make a separate helper script that starts up system events and then runs your script like this:\nstartApp(\"System Events\")\nset myApp to \"/Users/whatever/myScriptAsApp.app\"\ndo shell script \"open \" & quoted form of POSIX path of myApp & \" 2>&1 &\"\n\nLet me know how it goes.

As you can see, launching Chrome took about 76k free memory pages out for the free pool and caused the inactive pool to grow by about 11.5k pages.\nGiven these numbers, Chrome seems highly unlikely to be causing a leak itself and your web pages might be causing the load. If you can run these tools in terminal, you'll likely see that your system had other issues with memory management and Chrome is likely the straw that puts the final load on the system before it starts swapping. Look for paging activity before you launch Chrome and also have a look at my answer here on why inactive memory is almost never the actual problem and this post hopefully explains how to convince yourself whether you have an actual problem with the memory manager or a specific program.\n\n\n*\n\n*Isn't Inactive memory a waste of resources?\n\nA: I can not speak for Apple and they design philosophy.

But I don't have access to his account!\nHow can I either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update apps from another user\n\n*Download my OWN apps instead\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Applications downloaded from the App Store are available to all local users, there is no way (and also no real reason) to buy and download the same application twice. For updates you must be logged into the Store with the Apple ID used for the initial purchase.\nIn the situation described in the question the asker can\n\n\n*\n\n*log into the Store with the \"other\" Apple ID to get the download\n\n*ask whoever purchased the application to log into his/her account and get the update\n\n\nA: Uninstalling the application completely, then going to the App Store and purchasing it again will give you the most up to date version of the application (and will be tied to your Apple ID so future updates will work).\n\nA: This will not resolve the immediate issue of updating apps if the person behind the account with the purchased apps is unavailable, but one possible solution going forwards is using Apple's Family Sharing feature to share purchased apps. \nI can't confirm how this plays out for updating, (I don't use the feature), but using logic, it makes sense that shared apps would be updatable by users selected for sharing since users who are selected to receive shared content can download apps they did not originally purchase.\nIt's important to note that Family Sharing only works with up to 5 users. So this approach would not be appropriate for corporate and general work environments.\n", "Q: Cannot get postfix to listen on wifi interface (en1) I have a Mac running 10.8.4 which I am using as a server which is only connected to my network via Wifi (en1), however I cannot get the stock postfix process to listen on en1.

Assuming, though, that you qualified to have the initial device unlocked (per whatever terms and conditions your carrier specifies), you would presumably be able to have the new one unlocked without any problem.\n", "Q: How to install cURL on macOS with Homebrew?

The best answer I can find is this one on apple support, but it suggests splitting the PDF into separate 1-page files to drag them into Keynote individually and I'm sure there must be an easier way.\n\nA: There’s a simple app called PDF to Keynote that does just this. From the developer’s description:\n\nPDF to Keynote converts PDF-based presentations (e.g., made using LaTeX and Prosper) into Apple's Keynote format.\n\nI use it all the time for handling Beamer presentations, and it’s great. Free to download.\nPS: This app does not suport current (November 2014) Keynote 6.5 file format.\n\nA: After experimenting a bit I found a pretty good way to do this - not fully automated but fairly simple and does the job. If you open the PDF in preview and enable the thumbnail mode, you can drag the individual page thumbnails across to Keynote slide panel and it will add that page as a slide.\n\nA: Using Automator.app, you can create a task that will generate pictures from pdf files (you can even do it with multiple files), just search for Render PDF Pages to Images action in automator. Once you run the action, you drag-n-drop generated pictures on the slides panel in KeyNote and you're done.\nSee here for detailed instructions\n\nA: I tried the methods suggested in the other answers and was not successful.  I have Acrobat Pro so I just saved the PDF as JPEG, then put a JPEG onto each page of the Keynote presentation.  I'm sure there are better ways, but this worked easily for me.\n\nA: I used below converter, works good...\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-converter-free/id422540367?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\nIt's not mentioned specifically in the description of the app, but the comments in the reviews indicate it will convert a PDF to a Keynote presentation, not just a PowerPoint presentation.\n\nA: It's very simple: open the PDF in Preview, make sure the thumbnails sidebar is visible. All the pages of the PDF will be shown on the left side of the window. Simply move Preview a little out of the way so you can see you Keynote presentation behind, highlight the page you want from the PDF thumbnails, drag and drop. Repeat this for all individual pages you require. I use this simple method to create a clickable document inside a single keynote slide.\n\nA: None of the above approaches worked for me, maybe because of updates in the 2+ years since the last reply. I am now on Mojave. Dragging a group of PDF page thumbnails from Preview adds a new slide to Keynote with one of the pages added as an image. This is the same result as individually dragging that one PDF page.\nThe following approach which copies one page at a time worked for me.\n\n*\n\n*Add a new slide to Keynote and set its format to Photo. .\n\n*Switch (CMD+TAB) to Preview, select the PDF page thumbnail in Preview and copy (CMD+C) it.\n\n*Switch (CMD+TAB) to Keynote, click on the picture in the newly added slide.\n\n*Paste (CMD+V) the copied PDF page. It will replace the image in the slide, appropriately scaled to fit the entire slide.\n\n*If there are more PDF pages to copy, duplicate the slide you just pasted to, and repeat from 2.\n\n", "Q: Why do PNGs with embedded HTML links not open on iPhone and only allow to save as image? My company email (sent from outlook pc) signature has social media icons at the bottom - images hyperlinked to facebook, twitter etc. The hyperlinks work perfectly when opened up on PC's and other android and windows based smartphones.\nHowever, when received on an iPhone - tapping an image only allows you to save the image and the hyperlink isn't working.  \nThe files are PNG's and have had nothing different done to them.\nThe user who created the sig said that it was created through the option within Office 2010.\n\nA: I'm sure that the datatype of IMAGE:PNG isn't set up to have clicks that have hrefs in them isn't set up to be detected and processed in the viewer on the iPhone.\nCertainly appears to be a limitation in the image viewing code.\nIf you could save that image on your iPhone and send to your desktop over email, you could check if the href was being removed somewhere in the process, but I don't see an easy way to make this work.\n", "Q: Where can someone buy a refurbished iPhone?

I believe the refurbs are classified as Grade A, B and C and are priced accordingly.\n\nA: It is possible to buy a refurbished iPhone direct from Apple, when they have one in stock.  You can even save shipping by selecting to pick it up at an Apple store.  Sometimes volume sellers on eBay have them.  If you don't buy it from Apple, it may be refurbished by someone else and/or not have the one-year warranty that Apple always puts on their refurbs.\n", "Q: How do I move GarageBand's Lessons and other libraries to another drive? I'd like to move GarageBand's lessons (\"Learn to Play\") to another drive. How do I tell GarageBand where to look to find the files?\nSome context : I removed my Late 2009 MacBook's SuperDrive and now have two internal drives, a SSD drive on which I boot and the original internal drive. The \"Learn to Play\" directory in /Library/Application Support/GarageBand is now 7GB and I haven't downloaded all the lessons I want. It is on the SSD drive, but I need to save space on that disk. I think that for the lessons it is less important to have a fast drive than for the loops and instruments (but maybe I'm wrong?), so I'd like to move them to the other drive.\n\nA: *\n\n*Quit GarageBand\n\n*Move /Library/Application\\ Support/GarageBand/Learn\\ to\\ Play/ to another drive\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type ln -s followed by a space\n\n*Drag the folder created in the second step into the Terminal window to insert the path\n\n*add /Library/Application\\ Support/GarageBand/Learn\\ to\\ Play and press Enter\n\n\nTest it both the external drive connected and disconnected to be sure GarageBand doesn't have a problem with the LearnToPlay content not being available.\n\nA: I don't really use GarageBand but I would think you could move the folder they are in to the other drive then make an alias to it. GarageBand should then be able to follow that like any other folder.\nHow to make an alias: http://support.apple.com/kb/TA26514\n\nA: On OS X 10.9, GarageBand got upset when it couldn't find the Artist Lessons and Basic Lessons directories (folders) under Learn\\ to\\ Play when the external drive was disconnected.\nTo solve the problem, I copied Basic Lessons to the external hard drive (in my case, the external drive was called \"My Passport Edge for Mac\", and the full path was \"/Volumes/My\\ Passport\\ Edge\\ for\\ Mac/Library/Application\\ Support/GarageBand/Learn\\ to\\ Play/Basic\\ Lessons\"). Then I linked to each lesson individually. In the terminal window, I changed directories to the basic lessons folder:\ncd /Library/Application\\ Support/GarageBand/Learn\\ to\\ Play/Basic\\ Lessons\n\nand ran this shell script command to do the linking:\nfor name in /Volumes/My\\ Passport\\ Edge\\ for\\ Mac/Library/Application\\ Support/GarageBand/Learn\\ to\\ Play/Basic\\ Lessons/*; do\n    base=`basename \"$name\"`\n    echo $base\n    sudo ln -s \"$name\" \"$base\"\ndone\n\n(You'll need to substitute the correct path to your own copy of the Basic Lessons folder, of course.)  \nIt'll probably ask for your password; it's the same one you type to authorize the Mac to install new software and similar administrative actions.\n", "Q: Modifier key settings not sticking I just purchased a MacBook Air with OSX v10.8.4.

Namely, in System Preferences I remap Caps Lock to Ctrl, and it reverts itself back to Caps Lock after a day or two for no discernable reason.\nTo solve this you can use Seil to remap your Caps Lock key. Additionally, you can use Karabiner for a huge range of other keyboard settings. \n\nA: I had a similar problem on OS X 10.11.2 with a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 - where the modifier keys switched back after a few minutes. The Intellitype driver didn't help - it doesn't seem to do anything.\nKarabiner solved the problem.\nA really useful reference if you have that particular keyboard is Using Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 Keyboard with Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11)\n\nA: My experience was that I've had installed Karabiner-Elements on my Macbook Pro and forgot that the app mentions it will override any System Preferences regarding keyboard settings.\nSo, after opening Karabiner-Elements, I discovered that I had assigned Caps_Lock to Caps_Lock (marvellous) so the resolution was simple.\n\nA: I find the reset happens when a remote VNC connection comes in. Stop connecting using VNC and the setting no longer gets cleared.\nLike many others, I have switched to using Karabiner to prevent this reset.\n", "Q: Skipping .DS_Store files when copying between two external drives There are quite a few questions on .DS_Store files already, but none seem to answer my problem.\nI have an external hard drive with a dozen of ~ 50 GB backup folders.

For instance, how would you block google.com/news, without blocking google.com or any other subdirectories? I've already tried using the /etc/hosts file, to no avail.\nThis is for me. I need to shut out web distractions on my work computer, without limiting my ability to get stuff done.

Leechblock for Firefox and Chrome Nanny for Chrome both do the job well. If you don't trust yourself not to circumvent the protection, they also allow you to partly or completely lock yourself out of changing the preferences while a block is in place. \nThe disadvantage of this approach is that you need to set up blocking in each browser that you use, and also restrain yourself from getting around it by switching to Safari / Opera / Lynx / etc. \n", "Q: Why did some applications have to rebuild their database after a Time Machine rollback? Recently my system (10.8) got totally borked, so I booted into recovery mode and rewrote the entire disk from a two day old Time Machine backup.

Many thanks. \n\nA: A lot of caches and index files are excluded from backup because they can be rebuilt from information that is backed up. This helps save space on the backup drive.\nAnother question lists the default exclusions for time machine.\n", "Q: Disable Java Auto Update Prompt for 1.7u25 on Mountain Lion I'm having a heck of a time trying to disable the option \n\"Check for updates Automatically\"\nI ran composer to see what plist was being modified and it looks like\n~/Library/Preferences/com.oracle.javadeployment.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"    \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>/com/oracle/javadeployment/</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>deployment.macosx.check.update</key>\n        <string>false</string>\n</dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nSo I experimented with changing that value to true or false and it would not effect the checkbox under the Java Control Panel > Update > Check for Updates Automatically\nYour assistance would be much appreciated.\nInitially I was looking @ /Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin \n\nA: Open a Terminal and execute:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.oracle.java.Java-Updater JavaAutoUpdateEnabled -bool false\n\nSource: https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=6489\nUpdate:  This answer has been confirmed to work on OS X 10.11.5 (El Capitan)\n\nA: Perhaps a more general approach would be to unload  com.oracle.java.Java-Updater.plist via \"sudo launchctl unload com.oracle.java.Java-Updater.plist\" , and remove the plist from /Library/LaunchAgents?\n", "Q: What's the Way to clean out my mac ahead of giving it out?

If you erase the whole drive, it also erases the hidden recovery and EFI partitions, but the Mac can still start up in Internet recovery mode, which means that it downloads a disk image for the recovery system from Apple's servers.\n\n*Choose Reinstall OS X.\n\n\nIf you don't erase the data securely, the next owner might be able to recover files with an application like DiskWarrior or Data Rescue. If you have an HDD, you can erase data securely by choosing the single pass option from the Security Options sheet in Disk Utility:\n\nIf you have an SSD, see this question.\n\nA: The Apple way is to reformat the whole OS so that the new user can use Apple's Migration Assistant to set it up as if they had just got it from Apple.\nTo do this in Lion and above boot from the recovery partition and use Disk Utility to erase and  the other partitions.\n\nA: If you want to leave the applications and just delete your personal files, you can create a new administrator account, then log in to that new account and delete the other existing accounts.\n", "Q: MacBookPro wont boot Transcend SSD320 I have been having trouble booting my macbook pro.

When I plug my iPhone into the PC and iTunes comes up, the \"Other\" is taking up about 40% of the bar.

Perhaps an editor or another answer can field that portion of your question.\n\nA: The 40% of the bar is usually made of the iphone's own operating system. If you update to new operating frequently a lot of space would be taken especially if yours is only 16gb.  \nYou cannot actually check how much space SMS are taking, but they only take a very small percentage.\nYou also cannot remove only some of the SMSs if not manually.

That would also help out the graphics card.\nSo what are the limitations, if any, of AirPlay mirroring?\nAnd if this is not possible, are there any other hardware that will accomplish what I want?\n\nA: If your hardware supports it, it will work.  My mid-2010 mini doesn't, but my son's mid-2011 mini does support it.  He plays games on the Apple TV + big-screen TV.  He even brings his Bluetooth keyboard and mouse into the TV room, and they're close enough to the Mac mini to work.\nPerformance is NOT great on the high-framerate FPS kind of games, but should be good for Minecraft.\nEven when your HW does not support the built-in mirroring, there are some third-party SW that enables it.

I have homesharing on. When I log into my itunes on my computer it only shows a total of 40 movies, where are the remaining missing movies?\n\nA: I'm guessing this might have to do with iTunes in the Cloud. \niTunes has the ability to show you everything that is stored locally, or show you everything you've ever purchased from the iTunes store. \nFrom the VIEW menu click \"Show Movies in the Cloud\". This will make sure you're seeing everything you own.\nAlternatively you might have your iTunes set to only show un-watched movies. Make sure that you're not in the \"unwatched\" view. \nThe new Apple TVs have no real internal storage so if you're seeing stuff on the Apple TV it either means it's on your machine or in the cloud.\n", "Q: Enroll multiple times iOS Developer program Is it ok to enroll multiple times into the iOS Developer program to overcome the 100 device Limit ?

If not it would be nice to point me to the appropriate resource as reference.\n\nA: Yes. Although I couldn't find any specifics regarding the possibility of a Company having two or more iOS Developer Program accounts, in the Enterprise Program FAQ it is stated that:\n\nIf I am enrolled in the iOS Developer Enterprise Program, can I distribute my apps on the App Store?\nNo. The ability to distribute apps on the App Store is only available to developers enrolled in the standard iOS Developer Program. The iOS Developer Enterprise Program only allows you to distribute your apps to employees or members of your organization through Ad Hoc distribution.\nIf your company is enrolled in the iOS Developer Enterprise Program but would also like to distribute your app(s) to customers on the App Store, you will need to enroll in the iOS Developer Program.\n\nWhich means that Apple has no problem with a Company having more than an account, which is confirmed (with a regular program too) by my personal experience.\nEven more, in the specific case you present, as each developer would need to use his personal legal name, it would be, on practical purposes, as if you had hired a developer who was already enrolled into the program.\n", "Q: Format disk with one Windows and one Mac partition Can I partition an internal hard disk (in a Mac Pro or Mac Mini) such that it contains one partition usable for Mac OS and one usable for Windows?\nI know Boot Camp does that for the boot disk but I wonder if it will work for a second disk as well?\nBasically I want the system to start either Windows or Mac and use the second disk for data.\n\nA: If you have 2 hard drives you can do this way:\n1) On 1st drive install osx. Then use bootcamp assistant to re-partition the disk 1 and install windows on second partition. At this point you can via disk utility format the second drive as you wish (e.g.: second drive 1Tb= 500gb fat/ntfs for win data and 500gb hfs+ for osx data);\n2) On 1st drive install osx. Then use bootcamp assistant and select secondary hd (not the osx' one) and install windows. Now you have dual boot on 2 separate disk, 1 fully dedicated to osx and one to windows. \n", "Q: disk full - Mac OS won't boot My friend has a problem getting Snow Leopard to run because the disk is completely full. I suggested getting into command line mode (CMD+S on boot) and delete some things, but it didn't work (nothing happens) - is it because of full disk as well or because the OS is older? What can he do?\n\nA: You could try booting from the Snow Leopard installation media and free up space from there.  It's been a little while since I've used a pre-Lion system, but IIRC, the main drive should be mounted and available from the installation environment.  Just don't actually run the installation!\nIf your friend is having problems booting, it's probably worth checking the disk with Disk Utility as well from the installation environment before writing to it.\n\nA: You can start by turning on the computer and holding down the T key on the keyboard to get into Target Disk Mode, then connect via FireWire or Thunderbolt cable to another Mac which then mounts the hard drive on the desktop to enable you delete or backup files. You can free up space this way, which should then allow you to boot up normally.\n\nA: When you use target disc mode, do you need to use a Mac with a similar OS..? I have an older iMac I could use but it's running 10.6.8 compared to 10.11 on one side of the partition and 10.14 on the side with that's full.

How to make sure there's no personal information on the hard drive? My Mac won't turn on but I'd like to sell it for spare parts. How can I make sure there's no personal information stored on the hard drive for the buyer to retrieve?\n\nA: Depending on what model it is, if it has an Optical drive then you can insert the install disc that came with the machine and boot to the disc where you can use Disk utility to erase the drive.\n\nA: If the hard drive is OK and\none of the spare parts to sell,\nthen you will have\n\n\n*\n\n*to extract this disk from the MacBook,\n\n*install it within another one and\n\n*format it with DU + Security Options… = Zero Out Data (which is\nthe right one for the risk you want to cover).\n\n", "Q: Apple Software RAID: Add disk to array online I recently purchased a WD Thunderbolt Duo, which has two 4 TB drive, now running in RAID 0 with Apple Software RAID.\nMy question is simple, if I am to get another Thunderbolt Duo next year, is it possible to add the two additional disks to RAID 0 without going offline?

Can this be submitted as an update to the existing App? So can the type of an App changed later?\n\nA: Yes. \nXcode has built-in support for targeting specific devices with your app. It's as simple as selecting the target device from a drop-down list. \nThis could enable you to create an initial version that targets either iPhone or iPad, and then later switch to Universal and submit it as a new version.

The original ones all have the 'no entry' sign.\n\nHow do I make these new folders private, i.e. to the [myname] user only?\n\nA: There are a few different ways. Depending on your level of comfort with debugging permission errors, here they are ranked in terms of increasing risk. I'm not going to suggest you backup because you do that already, right?\n\n*\n\n*Whenever you create a new folder, secondary-click on it and \"Get Info\", then remove read/execute permissions for other users and groups.

Do not include the quotation marks and replace nnn with the desired umask value, such as 077.\nThis will set the user's umask for all applications they launch, such as Finder, TextEdit, or Final Cut Pro, and control the permissions set on new files created by any of these applications.\n\nNote that this will affect all files and folders you create from that point on and may be difficult to debug. As per @Kent's comment below, this will affect all users of the computer, not just your own. You may also need to logout or reboot the computer.\n\nIn all of these cases, you may see errors from some applications unable to access some files/folders. It can be argued that these are poorly-designed applications, but if you need to use them you may have to relax the permissions. 1 may be the safest and easiest to revert when/as needed.\n\nA: Open Terminal and type chmod go-rx ~/LocalSync.\n\nA: If you make a new folder in one of the restricted folders, it inherits those permissions and then you can move it up one level in the filesystem hierarchy.\nEven easier is to just store the files you create in one of the protected locations that the OS has set up.\nThis is more about how you are creating the folders than learning how to change things once they are incorrect.\n", "Q: How can I install an application from a .pkg without admin password?

When it starts in Airplane mode, all running processes are only local ones and you can then test the music player and the screen to isolate the device from the internet before re-enabling Wi-Fi and/or cellular data until you've gotten a feel for whether the issue is software, hardware or something that was corrupt on the running software and a reboot cleaned that up.\n", "Q: Filemaker server BUG: backup schedules DISAPPEAR after restart of host machine. Workarounds? Some time ago I discovered my Filemaker backup schedules mystically disappear. After some research I find out it happens right after restart of host machine. \nEventually I found this post on official filemaker forum\n\nThere is a major Schedules bug in FMS 12.0v3 that is happening on a brand new machine with a clean install of everything. This bug is preventing my client's databases from backing up properly (which is probably the most important requirement of all -- current backups). I don't know how to solve it, and my client is out $2,000 on a brand new machine.\nMy client was having this EXACT problem on an old FileMaker Server\n  machine, so he decided to spend $2,000 on a brand new iMac running\n  10.8.2 to replace his old machine. We thought that throwing money at the problem would solve the problems, but it didn't work because this\n  is a bug in FMS 12.0v3.\nCompletely brand new machine, straight from the Apple Store. We didn't\n  do ANY migrations of anything… no migration of FMS settings, no OS X\n  Migration Assistant, nothing. We simply installed FileMaker Server\n  12.0v1, updated to FileMaker Server 12.0v3, installed the latest Java, manually dragged his FileMaker files into the Databases folder, set\n  the permissions manually, and opened them in FileMaker Server.\nSo far, so good.\nThe problem is with the Schedules. I created 4 Schedules to backup all\n  the databases on a daily basis, and I manually tested all 4 Schedules\n  by right-clicking on each one and choosing \"Run Schedule\". All of them\n  completed perfectly fine. They all backed up the databases just fine.\nHowever, after I Stop FileMaker Server (using the Stop button in the\n  Admin Console, with a countdown time of 0 minutes) and I restart the\n  machine, one or more of the schedules WILL COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR from\n  FileMaker Server!! The schedules just completely delete themselves,\n  never to be found again!!\nAnd, for the schedules that DO somehow luckily remain in FileMaker\n  Server, they no longer show a \"Last Completed\" date anymore. They've\n  completely wiped out any history of their previous successful backups.\n  I don't even know if they will run again at their scheduled time. But\n  after each time I stop FileMaker Server & restart the machine,\n  Schedules will start deleting themselves.\nThis is hugely problematic, because backups are of mission critical\n  importance. This is on a brand new machine, just a few hours old, with\n  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING on the machine except for FileMaker Server and\n  Java. No migration of any data from anywhere… databases &\n  configuration settings were manually moved over.\nThis is the cleanest & purest testing environment ever, and yet this\n  serious major bug is still happening.\n\nAnd I just don't know what to do in this case, how should I make automatic backups? \nShould I relinquish Filemaker server's scheduling completely, and start using 3rd party automatic software (say, \"Time Machine\" since I have Mac). \nOr maybe I should make some sort of notification for system administrator? ( Startup Banner with text: \"Filemaker schedule is corrupted and needs to be restored manually\" )\nDid anyone face this bug, too?\nUPD I reapaired disk permissions, but it didn't help.\n\nA: I think I found a solution for this problem. Check your settings in the \"Security & Privacy\" Control-Panel. If your settings are on \"Anywhere\" by \"Allow Applications Downloaded from\" put it back to \"Mac App Store and idetified developers\" recreate your schedules in FMS and do a restart again. My schedules then kept in place. But be carefully. Do not reimport any exported FMS schedules. They will disapear again. Only way I could reuse some exported schedules was when I imported them while the settings where on \"Anywhere\" and then set the settings back to \"Mac App Store and...\". If I did it like this they kept in place. Hope this helps you.\nUpdate: Some further test's where bringing some further strange behavior. While I was investigate this issue I created a home directory for the fmsadmin user but cleared it out afterwards because I was thinking this is not the solution for the Issue. But after a reboot the schedules dissapeared again. I recreated then a home directory for the fmsadmin unser (did this in Workgroup Manager for 10.8 which is to seperatedly installed from Apple) and then the schedules I newly created kept in place. So you probably have to play through some different setups to get back in business.\nRegards\nFix\n", "Q: Automator > modifying an URL before downloading it?

Transitioning from Windows to the Mac. In Windows, I had a lot of environmental variables set-up that I used to speed up my work. Thinks like \nDEVDIR=C:\\WORKDOCS\\DOCS_jaravj\\PROJ\\dev\nDOCDIR=C:\\WORKDOCS\\DOCS_jaravj\nPERS=C:\\WORKDOCS\\DOCS_jaravj\\Personal\nPROD=C:\\WORKDOCS\\DOCS_jaravj\\PROJ\\PROD\nSVN=C:\\WORKDOCS\\DOCS_jaravj\\PROJ\\SVN_CO_Tort\n\netc...\nThat, and the \"magic\" of autocompletion in the \"Run\" box and in the file save/open dialogs, allowed me to move around very quickly.\nI've set up the equivalent env. variables in the shell, and I can cd and mv etc to the proper directories, but I haven't found a way to do something similar for the GUI apps, so that I can use the same shortcuts in the applications...\nI've followed the tips in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x to add the env vars to /etc/launchd.conf but when I am going to save a file (for example), I can't use $PROJ in the \"directory selector\" and have the file be saved there...\n\nA: I don't believe variables set in the environment are going to work in the Open & Save dialog box (OSDB). It's a nice idea, but you'd have to admit, kinda neckbeardy. \nThe Macintosh way would be to use the Favorites list presented on the left of the OSDB. Drag your often used directories there and you have one-click access. \nA much more powerful alternative is Default Folder X. This gives you an incredible degree of short-cutting and changes of default behaviors in the OSDB.\n\nA: If you really want to use the mentioned environment variables in Save dialogs, you could set up expansion short cuts with a tool like TextExpander or Keyboard Maestro which can expand environment variables to typed text and then use the \"Go to Folder\" feature (short cut Apple-G) (which is available in Save dialogs) to type the locations from the expanded environment variables.\nNote: Be aware that in the current Mac OSX Yosemite, the launchd.conf system not works anymore, but there are other ways to achieve the same thing.\n", "Q: Transferring photos from iPhone to windows computer I recently purchased an iPhone 5. I was using an android device before this. When I made the switch from android to iPhone I synced my photos from my android device onto my iPhone 5. When I synced those photos over it made duplicates of every photo and stored them in a photo album (not camera roll). \nHow can I get the photos from that album on my iPhone onto my windows computer and delete the duplicates? \nI am running the Windows 7 OS. So far I have tried importing photos and the only photos it will import are those from camera roll.\n\nA: tems in the Camera Roll or the Saved Photos album of your device can be imported to your computer, just make sure to follow the instructions provided in the \"Importing photos to your computer\" section of this article:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht4236\n", "Q: Can I collapse content spread across two displays to a unique space for each display when the 2nd display is removed? I use two displays at work and then I unplug my 2nd display when I go on the road/home.  It's an incredible shortcoming that all my content on the 2nd display gets squished so it's mostly off screen when I unplug the second display and revert to just the Macbook display.  It's also cumbersome to always be dragging windows around.  Is there a way to use one \"space\" but spread across two displays when I have two available but then when there is only one available collapse the content that I have on the second display to a second \"space\"?  \n\nA: I have not tried that specifically, but after trying out pretty-much every window-position-remembering app out there, I found that only Stay actually did what I wanted.\nIt lets one save the window configuration for each display configuration, and seems to be Spaces-aware.\nI have nothing to do with them, but thought they provided something useful.\n", "Q: Is it possible to add other networked sources to the Apple Dictionary program? The standard Apple Dictionary program in Lion provides access to Wikipedia. This appears to be a direct look-up (i.e., not to a cached local copy of Wikipedia).  I'd like to add other sources that way, such as for Urban Dictionary.  Can this be done?  If so, how?\n\nA: There are a few things you could do, but none of them are exactly what you're asking for. If you have a dictionary in the StarDict format, you could convert it for use in Dictionary.app with DictUnifier. You could also develop your own dictionaries, perhaps using the project template available as a supplemental download to Xcode.\nThose would create static dictionaries, though, not a \"live\" dictionary source like we have for Wikipedia. Wikipedia has special support files built into the Dictionary.app package. Cheaters!\nMy approach to this kind of thing has been to use the web search module in Quicksilver to add every dictionary I might want to check against (Oxford English Dictionary, Wolfram|Alpha, Black's Law Dict., Google \"define word, etc.), along with a keyboard shortcut that sends QS any selected text (or I can just bring up QS and type my search directly). Alfred, et. al., probably also have a similar feature.\nThis approach only searches one dictionary at a time, but usually I know which one(s) will give relevant results. Results come up in your browser; all the QS web search module does is format the URL for each source to perform the appropriate search. Also, since we're not using Dictionary.app these dictionary options will not appear when you CTRL+CMD+D on a word. (In fairness, neither does Wikipedia!) All that said, this approach requires minimal setup and is really quick.\n\nA: I'm using a custom dictionary made from Urban Dictionary (2012 edition). It has been tested on Big Sur 11.6. Follow the steps below to install and enable the dictionary:\n\n*\n\n*Download the dictionary from this Google Drive link.\n\n\n*Move or copy the .dictionary folder to ~/Library/Dictionaries\n\n\n*Enable (select) the dictionary in Dictionary preferences.\n", "Q: Free video converter where I can choose video/audio codec?

I have a Czech friend whose name is Jiří, and I want to add his name to my Contacts.  Pressing and holding R on the iPhone keyboard does not show any special character versions (and similarly on OSX, holding R doesn't show anything.  I found the character in Special Characters on OSX.)\nHow can I add his name to my iPhone contacts?  More generally, how do you get access to general special characters on the iPhone?  I don't know of any Special Characters equivalent app or functionality accessible through the keyboard, but I would guess there must be a way somehow.\n\nA: That character is not accessible from the English iPhone keyboard. You can, however, enable other keyboards on your iPhone.\nUnder the Settings app, go to General then Keyboards and select the Keyboards control. You can then touch Add New Keyboard… and add the Czech keyboard as an option.\nWhen typing, if you want to access theř key, hold down the globe key on the bottom row of the keyboard, select the Czech layout, and then when you press and hold r, you get the menu wherein you can select the ř.\nIf you frequently need Czech accents, keep the Czech keyboard installed. If this is a rare occurrence, you can then uninstall the Czech keyboard from Settings » General » Keyboards » Keyboards.\n\nThe easier way to access the ř character on a one-time basis would be to visit this page with your iPhone, copy the ř character, and then paste it into your friend's Contact information.\n\nA: For general access to special characters on iOS devices there are also various apps like Unicode Pad and Cymbol.  Some characters cannot be found on any keyboard.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Spotlight show invisible files that I know exist? I am running Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and had to edit an invisible file as part of an Android project.

Additionally, I've previously deleted the home number from my phone, and it's not stored on Facebook, so I don't know how it's getting it.\nIs there a caching issue?  How can I make iMessage display the correct contact names and phone numbers?\n\nA: Try closing iMessage (Settings > Messaging > iMessage).\nTurn off your phone and wait 5-10 minutes.\nTap Settings > Phone > My number and verify that your phone number is correct.\nFinally, reopen iMessage (Settings > Messages), then go to Settings > Messaging > Send & Receive and see if the correct number is displayed under \"Start a new session from\".\nHope this helps you.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't wake up when stacked on another sleeping MacBook Pro I noticed a really weird behavior on my MacBook Pro today.\nI have two of them at work, a 13\" late 2011 (which I don't use often), and a 13\" early 2011 where I put a SSD (which is my main computer).\nSo the late 2011 MBP usually stays asleep and the early 2011 (with SSD) sits on top of it. But I noticed that if I try to wake up the SSD MBP (by opening the lid) while the other one under it is sleeping, my MBP doesn't wake up. But as soon as I pick it up, it wakes.\nThis only happens when I open the lid when the MacBook sits on top of the other one. If I wake it up elsewhere, it works perfectly.\nI don't know if it's clear, as it's a bit weird. It's not really a problem actually but it would be nice if someone could clear up this mystery (still, I actually spent some time the other day trying to understand why it wouldn't wake up, I even reset the SMC)\nI thought about the magnet that holds the lid closed that could act like the iPad Smart Cover but the magnet doesn't seem to be that strong.\n\nA: It's the magnets, they aren't super strong, but strong enough to keep the lid close firmly. The magnet sensor is probably a little bit too sensitive. To confirm this hypothesis, you could turn one of the laptops around. So the magnet sensor of the top one is over the hinge of the bottom one.\n", "Q: Can I update both of my mac with the single purchase of OSX I would like to purchase OSX 10.8(Mountain Lion) using my apple account.\nThe question is am having two mac computers with snow leopard, Can I update both of my mac with the single purchase?\nany help?\n\nA: Yes.

It continued working just fine.\nSo, I took it home, and 2h later, when I pluged the charger in, the light turned into a very faint/dim green light and it was not charging anymore. It does not consumes battery power, because it's plugged in the outlet, but it does not charge either (says \"not charging\").\nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plugging it in to a different outlet\n\n*Trying other MagSafe chargers\n\n*Making sure it's the correct charger (85w)\n\n*Resetting SMC \n\n*Resetting NVRAM\n\n\nI have opened the back, and although I could not dismount it anymore because the lack of appropriate screwdrivers, I could find no sign of humidity or water damage.\nChecking the system information page in the MacOS, I could notice that, when the charger is plugged, amperage information gradually progresses from ~ -2000 to 0.\nAnd it does not seem to recognize the charger. See below:\nAC Charger Information:\nConnected:     Yes\nID:     0x0000\nWattage (W):     0\nRevision:     0x0000\nFamily:     0x0000\nSerial Number:     0x00000000\nCharging:     No\n\nDo you guys have any other suggestions?\n\nA: Yes - the SMC reset should resolve any temporary issues with the hardware not sensing the charge adapter. It's even called out in this KB article by Apple as something SMC reset can potentially address:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964\nOnce you ruled out SMC needing to be reset, you should get the Mac in to a repair shop or do what they would do to isolate the hardware failure:\n\n\n*\n\n*test your adapter with another computer\n\n*test your computer with another adapter\n\n*test your computer with another OS (last resort - SMC and the charging behavior you report can be tested with the OS powered off and only the firmware / SMC regulating the LED color and charge state based on the data it can collect which is faulty in your case)\n\n\nOnce they have isolated the failure (likely to your computer), they would open it and inspect for any corrosion or damage on the logic board and charging circuitry and the either swap and test the magsafe board or the battery or the logic board itself based on experience and the hardware service manual for your model.\n\nA: That happened to me as well. What I did was I downloaded an app from the Mac App Store called Battery Health. After I run the app my magsafe light was working again and my battery started charging; that seemed to fix the problem for me. I hope it works for you as well \n\nA: It's probable that your adaptor is wet. The Gold-coated pins actually move toward the inside of the tip of the cable where that green led is.

I don't know any way to make the shell environment more localized though.\nIf others were searching for how to make Terminal or iTerm use English, add for example export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 to .bash_profile. Disabling setting locale variables automatically would make shells use the default C locale, which makes working with non-ASCII characters difficult at least in bash and other programs that use readline.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall python 3.2.2 on Mountain Lion? How do I uninstall Python 3.2.2 on my MacBook Pro? I’m using Mountain Lion. Any answers greatly appreciated. I’m a beginning programmer.\n\nA: If you used the installer from python.org, remove these directories:\nsudo rm -r /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework /Applications/Python\\ 3.* /Library/Receipts/Python*-3.*.pkg\nYou can see what files are copied by the installer by pressing command-I, or with lsbom:\nlsbom Python.mpkg/Contents/Packages/*.pkg/Contents/Archive.bom\n\n", "Q: Using ipad as Internet connection in a wifi hub I need to set up a network with ten or more wifi connections in a motorhome with a bunch of iDevices, apple TVs etc. and want to have an outside web connection for all those devices. Most of the bandwidth will be internal data and not to/from the web.\nI can set up a personal hotspot but am limited to 5 connections.\nIs there any way to set up something like an airport express for all the wifi connections and have an ipad on the system as the only Internet connection, since the 10/100 of the hub will not be connected?\n\nA: Unfortunately none of Apple's routers can use the iPhone or iPad tethering as a source internet connection.\nIt looks like it might be possible using certain builds of the DD-WRT custom firmware with the Linksys WRT160NL, but based on that link, it looks like it will likely require a fair bit of hacking, beyond just installing the custom firmware (i.e. it needs to be certain versions, and it looks like further drivers need to be compiled/installed).\nIf you have a Mac handy, you could tether the iPad to it (with USB or Bluetooth), then use the Mac's Internet Sharing to share to the other devices over Wi-Fi.\nAlternatively, you could look into getting a 3G/LTE hotspot device from your wireless provider. It would likely entail some additional cost, but it would be most suited to what you're wanting to do. Some providers offer some data plan sharing amongst devices as well, so the additional costs might be minimal.\n\nA: I would recommend the Airport Extreme for 10 or more access points, not the Airport Express (since  Airport express has a limit of max 6 access points).\nPlease read this comparison of Apple products.\nSince you mentioned outdoor use, you might want to look at a range extender.\n", "Q: Seeing apps on multiple iPhones My family has 3 iPhone 5's and we share one iTunes account.  We sync on 2 different computers.  I do not want all the same apps on my phone.  Can I delete them from my phone without it deleting them without screwing up the other 2 phones?\n\nA: Yes - deleting an app from any device will not remove it from other devices.\nOnly if you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the app from iTunes\n\n*Sync more than one device to iTunes\n\n*Bypass the warning that an app is present on the device but not iTunes and skip the chance to import that app back into iTunes\n\n\nwill the deletion of an app in one place cascade over to other devices. You might also want to review which devices automatically download apps so that you don't get apps that are purchased and intended for another device.\n\nA: Also, be sure to disable automatic App downloads on your iPhone by going to Settings > iTunes & App Store. This way if someone from your family buys an app on their iPhone, it will not automatically download to your iPhone.\n", "Q: “Watch Later” Video Service for iPhone I regularly find articles on the internet and think “I’ll read that later”. These days I press a button, which uses Instapaper and lets me read it later on my iPhone. This works very well. \nHowever, I also often find YouTube videos and think “I’ll watch that later”. Unfortunately I don't have a handy process for easily sending videos to a ‘watch later’ on my iPhone — does such a workflow exist? \n\nA: Instapaper does have some basic YouTube functionality — if you save a YouTube page to Instapaper, it will appear in the app with a thumbnail and play button, so you can play it directly there.\nYou might also want to check out Pocket, which is similar to Instapaper, but a bit more focused on multimedia, rather than mostly just articles. I believe it has some sort of offline viewing mode as well, but I'm not that familiar with it.\n", "Q: How to find potential issues in damage macbook pro I spilled a glass of water on my early 2011 15\" macbook pro. The good news is that I'm writing this on that computer.\nAfter turning the machine off immediately, draining the water, checking for moisture inside, and disconnecting the battery I let it dry for a few days before taking it to the apple store. The genius essentially just connected it to a power source and turned it on. It booted, but the fans blew at full speed and it shut itself off while still running firmware.\nI tried the same thing at home with the same result, but after a few days I connected it to a power source without pressing the power button and it booted normally. I have restarted it since then.\nThe battery status reports \"replace now\" but other than that I can't find any other reports of damaged hardware. However the computer seems overall more sluggish than it should, with chrome occasionally lagging with 2.5 GB of free memory. I tested it a bit with minecraft and I had to change the render distance from far to normal to get decent performance.\nI'm also a bit concerned about the temperature sensor, since the behavior with the fans blasting at full speed before the computer turned itself off could be caused by the temperature sensor reporting overheating. I have been careful not to do things that would normally cause the machine to heat up too much.\nIs there any way that I can test for problems safely so that I can know what needs to be repaired before the computer is healthy again? I'm running Lion and have no optical drive if that is relevant.\n\nA: \" It booted, but the fans blew at full speed and it shut itself off while still running firmware.\"\nThis may be unrelated to the water damage. It is very common with high spec laptops that the fans get filled up with fluff and then overheat. It is a good idea to open up your laptop once in a while and hoover out the fluff. Or wipe it away with a clean, dry toothbrush. This is a problem I often had with a laptop that I had with coolers, fans and a high end graphics card a few years back.\nYou can tell if it struggling if you hear the fans running a lot, and the base of the computer gets hot. Cleaning out the fans can give your laptop a new lease of life.\n", "Q: Terminal path bar style for prompt I recently saw this in a demonstration online in someones Terminal:\n\nNotice the path-bar-like style of the prompt, any ideas how you can get that? Some kind of customisation I'd assume?\n\nA: You're looking for Powerline which originally came about as a Vim plugin (although the bash version has a different author). You need patched fonts to deal with the symbols. Like these\nEdit:\nThis screenshot is also using the Solarized theme I believe.\n\nA: The prompt is defined by the PS1 environment variable which you can define in your ~/.profile file.  For example to make it simply a \"$\" put this line in your .profile:\nexport PS1=\"$\"\n\nThen \"source\" (source ~/.profile) the file to make the changes active if you've edited it in a terminal or just open a new Terminal.\nDetails of the fancy special things you can insert there can be found by searching PS1, a good set of examples can be found at The Geek Stuff most examples are for Linux but it's nearly the same (possibly identical not 100% sure though)\n", "Q: How to use process sample in order to find high cpu usage in Chrome? I'm trying to figure out what the devil is wrong with Chrome getting 100% cpu once in a while. I sampled the process Google Renderer. Not sure where to go from here. any advice?\nprocess sample: https://gist.github.com/hadifarnoud/2371a33a5c3f39ede034\n\nA: You can view Chrome's page memory usage by pressing the button in the top right of the Window. There you will get this menu:\n\nWhen you click 'View Background Pages' you'll see a window like this:\n\nThis obviously narrows down page and extension usage by memory and CPU. This should help finding out exactly what's going on with it.\nThe 'Stats for nerds' link sends you to chrome://memory-redirect/ which breaks down their memory usage even more.\nSide note when I notice chrome using a lot of memory and open /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app I typically see it is caused by PepperFlashPlayer (Chrome Plug-In Host) which is Chrome's built in Flash player. It is known for hogging CPU\n", "Q: Buying iphone connected to a carrier for wifi As of right now I don't have a smartphone, but am debating getting one in the near future (although not sure in how long that will be.) My old itouch just broke, so i wanted to know if it is possible to buy an iphone off ebay, one that is connected to verizon (not unlocked) and use it with just wifi until I decide to add it to my network?\n\nA: You need to be sure the iPhone is not blacklisted.\nYou can use Verizon site:\nhttp://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/nso/enterDeviceId.do\nDepending on the iPhone model (CDMA or GSM) you need to enter MEID or IMEI code.\n\nA: Yeah, absolutely. You can buy and use an iPhone without a sim card installed at all and just use it on wifi. However if you want to get a plan later you will need to go with verizon or find a way to unlock it, if that's at all possible.\n", "Q: Screen brightness on Macbook Air June 2012 running Windows 7 Pro x64 Adjusting the screen brightness on my Macbook Air (June 2012) isn't working in Windows 7 Pro x64.\nI saw some comments online saying there's a regedit I can do to enable brightness, but that didn't work because this model doesn't use nVidia, it has an intel HD 4000 graphics chip as far as I know...\nI tried to install the HD 4000 driver from intel but now my laptop just boots to a black screen, but I'm confident I can fix that issue when I get home.\nI'm wondering if anyone here is successfully running win7x64 on their June 2012 macbook air's? So far only the screen brightness is an issue albeit a pretty annoying one for a laptop. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks a lot guys!\n\nA: The 64x support is terrible for this macbook air. If anyone else runs into this issue be ready to either struggle with power and display issues daily or just go to windows 7 x86. I dealt with the problems for about a month before switching, I'm much happier now.\n", "Q: How do I remove the Finder from the Dock automatically at login? This is related to this question here, except that, in addition to removing the Finder, I want to do it automatically. There are several solutions on the web that suggest using this AppleScript:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell UI element \"Finder\" of list 1 of process \"Dock\"\n        perform action \"AXShowMenu\"\n        click menu item \"Remove from Dock\" of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nUnfortunately, saving this as an application and having it run at login doesn't work; interestingly, running it within Script Editor does work, but this doesn't solve the problem of removing the Finder automatically.\n\nA: The solution is to create a LaunchAgent (man launchctl for more info) that runs the above script via the command-line. Essentially, you want to store the script above in a file, say 'killfinder.scpt' and then run the command osascript /path/to/killfinder.scpt. \nWe want to do this automatically at login, so we use a LaunchAgent. Since I want to use this because I use Pathfinder and my wife doesn't, I'm going to put it in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, but if you want this to be system wide, put it in /Library/LaunchAgents.\nYou will have three files:\n\n\n*\n\n*A UNIX script\n\n*An AppleScript (optional)\n\n*A LaunchAgent XML plist\nScript File\n\n\n*\n\n*Put this in an appropriate path. For example, I stored it in ~/dev/scripts/killfinder.bash.\n\n*Create the file and add this content:\n#!/bin/bash\nosascript /path/to/AppleScriptFile.scpt\n\n\n*Make sure the permissions are correct (i.e. chmod ug+x killfinder.bash)\nAppleScript File\nYou can call osascript directly with AppleScript code as an argument. I leave that as an exercise to the reader; in that case, you can creating this file. But if you want to do it this way:\n1. Put this in an appropriate path.\n2. Create the file and add this content:\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell UI element \"Finder\" of list 1 of process \"Dock\"\n            perform action \"AXShowMenu\"\n            click menu item \"Remove from Dock\" of menu 1\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the permissions are correct (i.e. chmod ugo+r Finder\\ Remove.scpt)\n\n\nLaunchAgent XML plist\n\n\n*\n\n*Put this in ~/Library/LaunchAgents or /Library/LaunchAgents depending if you just want this behavior for your personal account or system-wide.\n\n*Create a file called com.<whateveryouwant>.KillFinder.plist with the following content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n   <key>Label</key>\n   <string>com.<whateveryouwant>.KillFinder</string>\n   <key>Program</key>\n   <string>/path/to/unixscript</string>\n   <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n   <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nIt's important to make sure the 'string' value after the Label key is correct as well as the path to the unix script.\nNow all you have to do is exit and login and it should work!\n", "Q: Receiving a photo via iMessage: when is it downloaded? I am downloading a photo over iMessage.  When I see the previewed thumbnail image, is the entire photo downloaded? If not, when I open the photo will it be completely downloaded to my phone? Like stored in a folder of some kind? At what point will it be downloaded completely?\nAlso, if I save this to camera roll, does it transfer folders?\nJust a theoretical question; no real utility from it.\n\nA: I don't know about the theoretical, but the actual choices that offered in Messages include tapping twice on an image to access the Copy command, or tapping once to open in the image in its own window, in which case the usual arrow in a box appears, leading to a number of saving and sharing options, depending on what you have installed.\nOn the Mac, messages and photos (or any other attachment) are automatically synced between devices and stored in ~/Library/Messages/Archives and ~/Library/Messages/Attachments.\n\nA: \n\nWhen I see the previewed thumbnail image, is the entire photo downloaded?\n\n\nYes and no. Obviously, to be able to see the entire thumbnail image, the entire image is downloaded, but it is compressed. Think of when you save a jpeg with different quality settings. To save processing, the thumbnail image is displayed in a lower quality, that is why the loading wheel spins when you tap on the image to view full size. \n\n\nIf not, when I open the photo will it be completely downloaded to my phone?\n\n\nI'm not 100% sure on this one, but my guess would be that it is only stored in RAM at that time. It would make no sense to store it on the file system and still provide an option to save to the camera roll directory and then have to remove it from the temporary directory.\n\n\nAt what point will it be downloaded completely (if ever)?\n\n\nOnce you save it to your camera roll, it is downloaded fully. You can confirm this by turning your phone off and on again, the photo will still be there, which proves it is now stored on your drive.\n\n\nAlso, if I save this to camera roll, does it transfer folders?\n\n\nThis goes back to my answer of the second question, \"If not, when I open the photo will it be completely downloaded to my phone?\". If my guess is correct, then the photo is transferred to the camera roll directory when you save the photo.\n", "Q: Spotlight won't find apps after AppStore updates them This started happening with Type2Phone, an app from Houdah Software. Every time after I would update the app via the AppStore, Spotlight would no longer find the app (I use Spotlight for app launching). I contacted the developer, and following a series of steps, we found that what is happening is that somehow the updated app is having this attribute added to it:\nkMDItemSupportFileType            = (\n    MDSystemFile\n)\n\n[This is the output of the mdls command]\nThis explains why Spotlight is no longer finding the app.\nNow logically, he informed me that this command should remove the attribute:\nsudo xattr -d com.apple.metadata:kMDItemSupportFileType /Applications/Type2Phone.app\n\nBut although the command executes, it doesn't remove the attribute! I.e.\nmdls /Applications/Type2Phone.app/ | grep MDSystemFile\n\nStill has MDSystemFile as output.\nI've run Disk Utility to check for directory damage, rebuilt permissions, etc. to no avail. The only solution is to rebuild the Spotlight index completely -- but the problem will recur with a new update.\nAlthough it inexplicably only happened every time I updated Type2Phone, now it's happening when I update Tweetbot.\nAny insights into this problem which is driving me batty?\n\nA: I had the same problem with Outbank.app which was driving me nuts, as well.\nAfter a wile I found this site where I was told that writing the attribute with xattr actually updates the spotlight metadata. So,\nsudo xattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemSupportFileType \"\" /Applications/Type2Phone.app \n\nshould do the trick.\n\nA: You can try giving read-write permission to your App, its sub-modules, their sub-modules, theirs etc.\n$ sudo chmod -R 777 .   \n\n(Don't forget the dot \".\" at the end)\n-R stands for recursion. 777 is for \"read-write-execute\" for owner, group and everyone.\nRemember, checking if permission is causing the problem first is advised. In Mac, go to the path of trouble file path, right click, click \"Get info\", scroll down, see which permission is given (Read Only, Read&Write, Custom etc.). If the problem is not permission, giving high access level may cause security issues.\n", "Q: Can't Delete Calendars I'm having a bad time trying to delete a subscribed calendar. I am running OSX 10.8.4 on my iMac and IOS 6 on iPhone and iPad. Whenever I delete this calendar it reappears, usually within a few seconds. I have tried deleting from each device and from iCloud, without success. Any thoughts or suggestions would be most welcome. \n\nA: Assuming you use iCal (not specified in your question), then the Subscribed calender should appear under subscriptions.\nUN-checking them will stop showing them.\nIf you trying to completely remove them then Right Click on the calender and Delete in the Pop up.\n\n\nIf above fails lets do the \"brutal\" method:\n\n\n*\n\n*First make an iCal backup:  Click on each calendar on the left hand side of iCal one at a time highlighting it's name and then going to File Export > Export and saving the resulting calendar file to a logical location for safekeeping.\n\n*Go to iCal > Quit iCal\n\n*Remove the following to the trash and restart your computer:\n\nHome > Library > Caches > com.apple.ical\nHome > Library > Calendars > Calendar Cache, Cache, Cache 1, 2, 3,\n  etc. (Do not remove Sync Cache or Theme Cache if present)\n\nLaunch iCal and test.\nIf the issue still persists at this point:\nRemove the following to the trash and restart your computer:\n\nHome > Library > Caches > com.apple.ical\nHome > Library > Calendars > Calendar Cache, Cache, Cache 1, 2, 3,\n  etc. (Do not remove Sync Cache or Theme Cache if present)\nHome > Library > Preferences > com.apple.ical (There may be more than\n  one of these. Remove them all.)\n\n---NOTE: Removing these files may remove any shared (CalDAV) calendars you may have access to. You will have to re-add those calendars to iCal > Preferences > Accounts.\n\nA: I was having this same problem getting rid of old calendars. They kept popping back on. I figured that all of my electronics were back feeding each other. I got the iCloud calendar on my monitor, the calendars on my laptop, iPad and phone all displayed. Then I deleted one calendar from each of them as fast as I could. Then I took the next one and deleted it in sequence as fast as I could. They are gone and have not reappeared. I hope this works for others.\n", "Q: How does Apple calculate the energy consumption of a process in OS X Mavericks In OS X Mavericks you can monitor the energy consumption of different processes in Activity Monitor.\nHere we can see 'Energy Impact' and Avg Energy Impact' and that the values can exceed 100. \nAlso there will be a menu bar icon which lists the most energy consuming applications running right now.\nIs there any documentation how apple calculates the current energy consumption? Is there a mapping between CPU utilization and energy consumption?\nHopefully there are some experts here who can give me a hint.\n\nA: The number appears to be coming from the program top. I found the following blog post which investigates this calculation in much more detail: https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2015/08/26/what-does-the-os-x-activity-monitors-energy-impact-actually-measure/\n\nIn every case, Activity Monitor’s “Energy Impact” was the same as top's POWER measure. Every indication is that the two are computed identically on this machine.\n\nSince top is open-source, we can investigate an actual formula/code for how this number is calculated, and the blog post summarizes this as:\n|elapsed_us| is the length of the sample period\n|used_us| is the time this process was running during the sample period\n\n%CPU = (used_us * 100.0) / elapsed_us\n\nPOWER = if is_a_kernel_process()\n          0\n        else\n          ((used_us + IDLEW * 500) * 100.0) / elapsed_us\n\nAs @Ruskes hints at, the calculation is based on wake-ups of your process measured at the millisecond level. The blog post mentions that:\n\nThe POWER computation is a function of CPU and IDLEW. It’s basically the same as %CPU but with a “tax” of 500 microseconds for each wakeup and an exception for kernel processes. The value of this function can easily exceed 100 — e.g. a program with zero CPU usage and 3,000 wakeups per second will have a POWER score of 150 — so it is not a percentage. In fact, POWER is a unitless measure because it is a semi-arbitrary combination of two measures with incompatible units.\n\nSo essentially, you can think of the number as a measure of CPU wake-ups.\n\nA: There are many aspects of CPU utilization that affect energy consumption. It's not merely how much CPU does an application consume, but also how often and how flexible it is about it. The latter can have much bigger effect.\nAn application that needs to wake up exactly every 10ms to execute just a few lines of simple Obj-C code can have an order of magnitude larger energy impact than the same application executing thousands of lines of code but just once a second and not being very particular about exactly when within that second will the calculation happen.\nApple probably uses Intel's performance counters and accounts them to your application. You'd probably gain most insight by following Intel manuals first to understand the power states and energy management. This will highly vary between architectures. A badly behaving app can have a much bigger impact on Haswell than on an \"old\" Core 2 machine.\nUse of other resources, such as the audio system, doing disk I/O or using USB devices may be also factored in. A likely accounting method would assign to your application all of the energy use needed by the resources your application uses exclusively (say a custom USB device, access to an otherwise powered-down audio syste), and do some sort of pro-rating for shared hardware.\n\nA: It all starts with precision monitoring and measurements down to Milliseconds.\nAs example Intel has made a tool to monitor the Intel CPU parameters.\nIt displays the Power the Frequency and the Temp.\nThe Power usage and the Temperature are products of the Frequency (the speed), or the amount of data processed.\nThe sampling rate is Milliseconds and the power is in Watts, and it measures the Total Power for the CPU while the Activity monitor breaks it down by Application/Process.\n\nHere is a article from Apple about power management/consumption that goes in to bit more details how is power managed.\nIn summary, using the ms power measurement one is able to better control the overall power consumption.\nBefore TC \n\nUsing the above information on per Application and the resulting cumulative Power usage Apple has implemented the Timer Coalescing and the App Nap features to manage Power consumption resulting in the Chart below.\nAfter TC\n\nTo see more information on above charts visit this article.\nSince the CPU control's activity including RAM management and disk read/writes,Network Card and others for example improving RAM management also reduces power consumption that occurs by to frequent disk R/W activity. \nThere are many aspects of power management, and they are a combination of very accurate measurement and software designs to reduce the power consumption.\nSome examples are:\nApp Nap feature\nTimer Coalescing feature PDF\nRAM management feature\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be any documentation on how the power consumption is calculated. The CPU usage alone cannot reliably predict power consumption. So the primary factors considered would be (these are somewhat complementary to what App Nap looks at and controls):\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU usage\n\n*Disk input/output\n\n*Network input/output\n\n*Peripheral use (like audio speakers, for example)\n\n\nAgain, there are no details on how each of these factors are measured and the formulas used to calculate the power consumption. We can make some educated guesses by the fact that every Mac (and also PC) comes equipped with various sensors within the system. You can use a tool like Hardware Monitor to see what sensors your Mac has and what they're reporting in real time.\nThe key sensors related to power consumption that are available (and have been for several years) in Hardware Monitor are CPU Voltage, CPU Current and CPU Power. For other elements in the above list, there are no hardware sensors to measure power consumption. So Apple must be using specific extrapolation factors depending on the model of the Mac and the underlying hardware.\n", "Q: Retina Mac shows gray screen when waking up This is the first time that my Retina MacBook Pro wakes up from sleep with a gray screen. After about 10-20 seconds, the MacBook falls asleep again.\nSome points that might be relevant:\n\n\n*\n\n*The only difference between power adapter and no power adapter is that with power adapter it does not go to sleep again.\n\n*The battery is almost full (I closed the lid last night when it was about 90%)\n\n*An external monitor was not attached when sleeping it, so I don't think How to fix a Macbook that does not always draw its internal screen after waking from sleep and having unplugged external display while asleep? applies.\n\n*I've run gfxCardStatus, almost always in \"force integrated mode\" (to conserve battery). And normally it wakes up correctly.\n\n*I run VMware Fusion 4.\n\n*All software is up-to-date and fully patched.\n\n\nI tried to plugin an HDMI monitor and switch displays with Command-Fn-F1 and Command-Fn-F2, but that did not help (it would not switch displays).\nEdit: I also tried logging in (see the comment by George Garside) but that didn't work (though the password field had focus, the screen didn't fade).\nBefore trying to:  \n\n\n*\n\n*reboot (by force a power off), \n\n*reset SMC \n\n*and/or reset PRAM/NVRAM\nWhat options do I have that do not loose my work?\n\n\nA: This is a workaround to save my work, then reboot.\nAssumption: remote ssh is enabled and accessible on the Retina MacBook\nSteps (note: \"it\" is the Retina MacBook):\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect it to power, switch it on, and make sure it is connected to your LAN\n\n*Login over ssh to it through a terminal from another machine (I used a MacBook Air, but could be any machine that has an ssh client)\n\n*Enable screen sharing as described at Enabling OS X Screen Sharing from the Command Line\n\n*Remote connect through VNC to it \n\n*Save all your work\n\n*Shut it down\n\n*Start it\n\n*Login\n\n*Install DeepSleep (or a free DeepSleep)\n\n*Force a Deep Sleep\n\n*Wake\n\n\nIt woke fine, so I hope this was a one-time issue.\n", "Q: Is there a simple way to enable/disable groups of fonts? I mostly works with Photoshop and Coda (programming app). I have installed many fonts and at the time I work with Photoshop I need all my fonts enabled. \nBut then after I don't need all the font but only the default system fonts.\nProblem is that these font are slowing down my machine.\nCan I create groups of fonts and then enable/disable these groups? \n\nA: You can create font collections in OS X's own Font Book. These collections are shown in the left column and can be activated and deactivated from the context menu (right click on a collection name).\nFonts can exist in multiple collections, so you could create one with all fonts to be deactivated after your Photoshop work, but also more differentiated and overlapping groups if needed.\n", "Q: Drag & Drop: How to prevent folders in my Dock to pop up as windows? I have a folder in my dock where I want to drop files. When hovering over the icon, the folder always pops up as new Finder window. I want it to be a stack or a list.

So what I did was to change the alternate to another email thinking I would be able to now use the old alternate as my apple id. Unfortunately and for some very strange reasons,apple is telling me I cannot use alternate email as my id when I had actually changed and verified my new alternate email. Can someone please help me out here?\n\nA: According to Apple's support page: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to My Apple ID, click \"Manage your Apple ID,\" and sign in.\n\n*Delete the alternate email that you have. Click Yes when it asks for confirmation.\n\n*With the Name, ID, and Email Address drawer selected, click Edit next to Apple ID and Primary Email Address.\n\n*Enter your new email address.\n\n\nI just applied the following steps above to my own Apple ID and it did not complain.\n\nA: I had the same issue, but I found a solution!\nThere are 2 separate sets of safety emails, an \"alternate email\" in the name, ID, and email addresses section of AppleID and a \"rescue email\" under password and security.\nI only deleted the email I wanted to make my primary as an alternate email, not realizing that it was also my rescue email. After deleting it as my rescue email it was no longer associated with my AppleID and I could make it my primary.\n\nA: I ran into this situation when my wife's email was previously an \"alternate\" email address on my own Apple ID. I solved it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove alternate email address\n\n*Login to the Apple ID using the email address you just removed (https://appleid.apple.com/)\n\n*If you don't know the password, reset the password.\n\n*Once logged in, this is now a separate Apple ID\n\n\nA: I've got two separate Apple IDs as I decided I wanted to keep both (not sure of the consequences if I remove one then add that as an alternate to my newer ID).\nAll answers above are correct (it won't let me comment as a new user).\nJust wanted to note I had no issues using my original Apple ID as a rescue e-mail address for my new Apple ID. You may need a fresh browser window).\nAlso, if it doesn't let you login - either via the app store or the website - the website will tell you if you're in a time out due to too many attempts. Try again in 15-20mins and make sure you refresh your browser before you enter details (possibly use a different browser).

AppleScript is not capable of just sitting and detecting a clipboard change, but you can set a regular interval for it to check your clipboard. Using variables, you can deduce if the clipboard data changes over time and set an IF THEN statement to run the text file process each time a change is detected. As far as having this run in the background, you can make the AppleScript a login item through System Preferences.\nHere is a good template for polling the clipboard for changes. And here is a good starting point for the AppleScript code to copy into a text file.\n", "Q: Scheduling Appointments for iPhone Repair at the Apple Store? In our IT department we have two iPhones 5 with cracked screens and we need to get them fixed.  \nI've gone to the Apple Store personally for my iPod Touch 4G, and I was required to schedule an appointment at the Genius Bar.  \nDoes this work the same way for businesses?  I found the Apple Store in question on their website, and there's a space to Make a reservation at the Genius Bar, but there is also Access Member Services which I didn't see the last time I scheduled an appointment. \nDoes scheduling an appointment for a business differ from scheduling a personal appointment to fix an Apple device?  Also, can they fix it the same day, or ship the repaired product back to you?\nI saw a video on replacing the screen of an iPhone 5 and it doesn't look that difficult provided you have the right tools.  However the screens we ordered online didn't work, so that is why we are reverting to the Apple Store.\n\nA: You have a few options within Apple's eco system.\nThe first is Joint Venture, a program that gives priority service to business customers both over the phone and in store.  With Mac repairs this also allows for a loaner if needed for the duration of the repair.  You can read more about Joint Venture at Apple's business page.  It IS a paid, subscription, service but depending on your needs it could be helpful.\nThe second would be to look into their iOS Direct Service Program.  Essentially entering into the program allows you to train your IT staff to properly diagnose iOS devices in accordance with Apple's guidelines and setup service on them directly, without dealing with AppleCare/Genius Bar.  It's a free service but your organization will need to set up normal credit/billing info with Apple and jump through an application process to enroll.\nThe third option is creating a mail in repair with AppleCare.  They can provide a quote over the phone and send you a prepaid box to ship the phone in to them.  Shipping is overnight each way (one night to get the box to you, one night for the phone to reach them, another night to come back to you) and included at no additional charge.  This is true for warranty and non warranty repairs.\nWith all of that said... I typically take our damaged devices into the Genius Bar by scheduling online ahead of time.  An appointment IS required, however if you show up without an appointment they can often squeeze you in within an hour. They'll provide a free quote and if the part is in stock offer to repair it at that time if you agree to the cost.  If nothing else it gets you out of the office for an hour!  If I were in your shoes I would do this.  By checking the \"business related\" box in the reservation system you should end up with a member of the business team coming out to tell you about Joint Venture.  If they don't you can always ask the Genius or Concierge about meeting with a member of the Business team to discuss exactly how Joint Venture could help in situations like this.\n", "Q: New Web Inspector for Safari?

If I use up all my main memory, the computer crashes. The screen freezes on whatever window it was on (not a kernel panic), and is totally unresponsive.\nI have also noticed that the \"wired\" memory usage in Activity Monitor seems to get very high - most of my RAM usage is \"wired\". And even upon boot, there is a kernel_task process that uses 1.5GB + of memory which seems somewhat high. These points may or may not be relevant.\nI know I have needed virtual memory in the past and had no problems, so I have no idea what is wrong. It seems as if the computer just flat-out refuses to use virtual memory - that would certainly explain the crash. In fact, my /private/var/vm/ folder does not even exist.\n\nA: Turns out the simple solution sometimes is the proper one after all! It seems /private/var/vm/ should always exist (even if it is empty, ie on restart), so however it got deleted the answer was to just sudo mkdir /private/var/vm/. Seemingly non-robust coding on Apple's part, but at least it's fixed. Never mind!\n", "Q: How to install and setup s3fs on OS X 10.7 (Lion) I installed s3fs, a tool that allows mounting Amazon S3 buckets as a file system. I created folder for mounting in /mnt/s3 then I created a file in /etc/passwd-s3fs with the content BucketName:AccessKeyId:SecretAccessKey\nbut I still can't access it, and the error is:\n\ns3fs: could not determine how to establish security credentials\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: For Amazon s3fs you have two options for credentials: root or per user.\nFor a root setup you would place your credentials in here:\n/etc/passwd-s3fs\n\nAnd then make sure the permissions to that file are 640 like this:\nsudo chmod 640 /etc/passwd-s3fs\n\nThe contents of that file should simply be [AccessKey]:[SuperSecretKey] with those two values substituted for your real access key and super secret key. Note I did not prefix the “bucket” name as you have in your example. I would recommend just seeing if you can access the S3 stuff to begin with for testing.\nIf you want to do user level credentials, that would be placed in the home folder of the user who would need to have s3fs access. So it would if this were for you, it would be in here:\nnano ~/.passwd-s3fs\n\nThe contents of the file would be the same as /etc/passwd-s3fs but the permissions would be different. So make sure those permissions are 600 like this:\nchmod 600 ~/.passwd-s3fs\n\nThen as far as mounting goes, this is how you would mount the contents if you are root:\nsudo s3fs [BucketName] /mnt/s3\n\nBe sure to change the bucket name to match the actual bucket you wish to mount. And to run that on a per user basis using the ~/.passwd-s3fs credentials, just run the same command without sudo like this:\ns3fs [BucketName] /mnt/s3\n\nTo unmount the mounted bucket, just do this:\nsudo umount /mnt/s3\n\nOr do this if you are using a per-user setup:\numount /mnt/s3\n\n\nA: Looking at the code, it opens a stream to read the file. Before it passes that stream to the method that reads the content, it checks for errors on the stream. My guess is that the user trying to mount doesn't have permission to read the file. \nThe right way to fix this is to give that config file the proper ownership and permissions if you can determine what it should be. If you cannot, you can open up the permissions to make it readable by everyone as a test. \nTry running chmod 666 /etc/passwd-s3fs to make it world readable and see if that allows you to mount. Note that some programs (such as OpenSSH) are written to warn or fail if config files have permissions that are not restrictive enough. I only looked quickly, but didn't see that in s3fs.\nOnce you confirm the config file is correct, you must then set ownership and permissions to something more reasonable from a security perspective. Anyone reading your credentials from that file can then use your AWS S3 account.\n", "Q: Easily pretty print XML Is there a way to quickly pretty print large XML files without needing an app?

Unfortunately, the only documentation I can find for it is the man page which says nothing about how to interpret the results.\nAre there any good places that document the output and how to interpret it? If not, can someone give me a very basic tutorial?\n\nA: I just checked the Man page on sample\nand it looks to me like a half-decent call-stack sampler.\nIt claims that its output is the call-tree, so that should not be too hard to comprehend.\nI say half-decent because collecting call-stack samples is a good thing. The criticisms are:\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't say if it collects samples when the process is in a system call, like waiting for I/O. It is important to do so, unless you want to be blind to needless I/O.\n\n*It falls for the fiction that what matters is accuracy of timing and you don't want to miss any functions, so samples have to be really frequent. It's a fiction because the goal is to find big stuff, not to measure little stuff. Any function that doesn't appear certainly doesn't cost enough to care about.\nThe consequence of this fiction is there are too many samples for you to look at, so it has to try to find a way to summarize them, so it chooses a call-tree. The fact is, if you are allowed to actually examine a small number of the samples (like 10 or 20) you will see exactly the reason(s) for the slowness. The summarization is the problem. It smears out and hides the information.\nSo, the long-and-short is, it appears to be a good tool for collecting call-stack samples.\nIf you can figure out how to actually see a selection of them, it will tell you what the problem is.\n", "Q: Write .iso to USB on Mountain Lion I'm trying to create a bootable USB for Windows using Disk Utility on OS X 10.8.4.  Downloaded CentOS 6 for 32-bit and tried to use Disk Utility to create a bootable USB drive. This method failed with one of the two following errors: \n\n\n*\n\n*\"Could not restore - Invalid argument\" \n\n*\"Could not restore - error 254\" \nNone of these solutions worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert the .iso to .dmg \n\n*Change permissions to rwx+ugo on image \n\n*Download image from another mirror \n\n*Use \"minimal\" image vs \"full\" \n\n*Change USB stick \n\n*Restore the \"/Volumes\" image (i.e. dragging from Desktop, not left panel of DiskUtility) \n\n\nUNetbootin appears to burn the image to the USB, but testing on a Windows box shows that the disk image is missing. \nFor more on the Disk Utility errors: \nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1389072\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1507263?start=0&tstart=0 \n\nA: did you try: \nhdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/target.iso\n\nafter that unmount using:\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX\n\n(X is the disknumber of your usb device)\nNow just burn it using dd\nsudo dd if=/path/to/target.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m\n\n\nA: Depending on the distro (not sure about centOS), sometimes just extracting the raw ISO to a freshly formatted flash drive in FAT32 will work. Could you try that and see if it works?\n\nA: You can try to \"burn\" the ISO to the USB stick with the command-line utility dd. To do so, you can follow these instructions on the Ubuntu site.\nEssentially you have to convert the .iso to a .img disk image and then copy it, byte by byte, on the device.\n", "Q: Time Machine backup is too large (but shouldn't be) I get:\nThis backup is too large for the backup disk. The backup requires 35.72 GB but only 24.79 GB are available.\nFacts:\nEstimated size of full backup: 149 GB\nSize of Backups.backupdb on the Time Machine drive is 166 GB and there is 18GB of free space on the drive.\nSo why doesn't the backup go through? It should be able to delete old files... especially since the current backup size on the drive is less than it is required for the new one.\n\nA: I know what is the problem... I only have one backup on time machine and it won't delete it because it's the only one. So I can either clean up some space on the drive (I have other things there) or just delete the backup and let it run again.\nHow to delete a backup - from here:\nThe easiest way is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter time machine (on the Mac whose backup you want to delete)\n\n*Go to the point in time you want to delete\n\n*Select the icon that looks like a cog in the finder and choose 'Delete Backup'\nThis ensures the backup catalog remains accurate and the integrity of your data stays intact.\n\n\nA: I never had this problem until I tried using my 1TB disk to backup my main drive (256gb) plus my extra drive (750gb). So, just 1 to 1. The problem is, for most cases, TM disk should be at least twice as big (as your data).\nYou probably have a disk that's too small! And you'll be better off either reducing how much data you want to backup, by excluding some folders from it (under TM options), or simply buying a bigger disk. 2 TB disks are quite affordable nowadays, specially if you consider how much it would cost you to lose your data...\nOf course, you can also keep manually deleting backed up data to make the message go away every time it appears... But that will beat most of the advantages of automated backup. In fact, if a backup is not automated, you won't do it as often as you should thus making it most likely a useless backup for when you need it, it shall be outdated.\nNow... If that's not your case, then there's this one site resource for all things Time Machine. And this is their relevant article about full disks: http://pondini.org/TM/C4.html (or try the wayback machine).\n\nA: When TM needs rom it does not delete the entire backup, it looks for files you deleted and no longer needs, and removes those from the backup to make room.\nYou really should be using a drive that is at least twice the size of your current drive, but that's besides the point.\nAre you using Parallels, VMware or Virtualbox? Those tend to have large virtual machine disk images, and need to backup the entire image every time you do a backup. I've seen reference to ways to change the disk image into \"slices\" to work around that.\nIf you have anything you can exclude form the backups, like podcasts or your download folder, do that, and then clear out all the \"extra\" files you have stored on the drive, and see where you end up.\n", "Q: How do I restore a jailbroken iOS 6.1/iPhone 5? My iPhone 5 is running iOS 6.1, jailbroken.  I've managed to lock myself out of the phone and don't know the passcode.  Device is disabled for longer and longer periods of time in between incorrect passcode entries.\nI've been backing up to iCloud and periodically locally to iTunes.\nMy objective: Ideally I would like to get back to my most recent iCloud (or local iTunes) backup, and stay jailbroken.  My second most preferred choice is to get back to my most recent backup and then re-jailbreak.  Worst case is bring the device to 6.1.2 (which is the latest version that there is a jailbreak for) and re-jailbreak and reinstall everything.\nI am reading lots of conflicting and confusing things about how to do this, so I am not sure about the procedure.\nMy first attempt went like follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach iPhone to PC, iTunes sees it.\n\n*Download 6.1 firmware ipsw (because the latest version of iOS, 6.1.4, which iTunes tries to use, can't be jailbroken)\n\n*In iTunes, hold shift then click Restore iPhone, then I pick the 6.1 file\n\n\nand I get the following much-mentioned but not much solved error:\n\nThe iPhone [device name] could not be restored because the firmware file is not compatible.\n\nDoing this while the phone is in DFU or Recovery modes doesn't change the result.\n\nI then tried the same steps, but this time selecting the 6.1.2 ipsw file.

Why do I need to reboot after updating Airport Utility to version 6.3.1?  Is there some kind of serious kernel tweaks involved in Apple's new router tool?  Since when does a robust UNIX operating system need to REBOOT after an update to a basic router utility.  A device which has no bearing whatsoever on the core functions OS X.  I'm dumbfounded by this.  Not only that but it took a whopping 3 minutes to apply the patch.\nSomebody please break this down for me.\n\nA: There is no known reason why upgrading an Airport Basestation or Airport Utility should lead to a reboot (and I've never run into this situation either). The best guess (as already stated in the comments above) is that another upgrade was applied at the same time which required a reboot afterwards. Whether you just didn't realize the additional upgrade or it somehow \"sneaked\" into the upgrade process due to a bug/race condition in the Software Updater is something which is probably impossible to analyze post-factum.\n", "Q: Why does my macbook always shut down on recovery?

The LED (red) inside the mouse is turned on for a few minutes (the mouse has transparent case, so thats easy to spot).  I don't hear the fan, but certainly MBA puts some power on the USB port. After a few minutes is goes off again. I think it repeats a few times a night.\nAnyone has a clue what goes on?\n\nA: If your MBA is in Power Nap mode it will perform functions. \nSome of them might activate the USB mouse.\nIf it bothers you disable the power nap.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to an individual developer to invite another developer to manage apps on iTunes Connect? I developed an application for my friend who has an individual developer registration, I have got a simple developer registration without individual enrollment. \nIs it possible to invite me at the Apple App Store to manage this application? or we need a company registration?\n\nA: Whilst @Thecafremo's answer is true for program resources, to manage apps as OP stated, you can add users to access iTunes Connect without needing a company account.\nSimply go to iTunes Connect → Manage Users → iTunes Connect User → Add New User.\n\n\nA: Only Company / Organization accounts can add additional developers to its team.

The system will not start, even in safe mode, it gives me an error. If it were a windows machine, I would probably put in a startup disk, but I do not have one. I can read the files on the drive from the mac side, but the system will not start in windows. It worked great before this but it must have gotten a virus. help\n\nA: Just an idea: maybe try making an image of the Windows partition with WinClone and then try to restore it - it will offer to recreate the \"boot files\" - if I remember correctly.

I can open each clip individually and manually export it through Quicktime, but this is a time consuming process I would prefer to automate. What is the best way to automate exporting each of these individual \"clips\" into their own movie files?\nFor reference, the \"clips\" view that shows upon opening the huge AVCHD file looks like the following:\n\n\nA: I ended up just opening each file in QuickTime and exporting each clip manually. It wasn't the optimal solution, but did get the job done. \nFor future viewers, showing package contents on the video file did yield a set of individual movie files in MTS format. I defaulted to manually exporting each clip, however, because I wanted the files in MP4 and didn't have access to a video converter app. However, that would have been a viable option as well. \n\nA: Consider using Automator to set up an action, such as the one here:\n\nThis uses the \"Get Specified Movies\" action to take whatever files you desire, and then uses the \"Encode Media\" action to convert each of them to your desired format before copying them to your selected destination. You could get fancier with it if you like, but this should cover the basics.\n", "Q: How can I enable syntax colouring in vim using Terminal?

Just got a brand new MacBook Air which shipped with Mountain Lion 10.8.4 and no Java installed. There is a /usr/bin/java, but running it would prompt me to install an Apple-distributed Java 6 runtime in a Cocoa dialog.\nHowever, Oracle is no longer supporting Java 6, and I don't want to be running an unsupported and probably insecure Java installation.\nSo, I went to Oracle's Java SE downloads and installed the latest JDK, jdk-7u25-macosx-x64. Now the only Java I have on this machine is 1.7.0_25, distributed by Oracle. /usr/bin/java -version now works.\nI just ran brew cask install eclipse, and ended up with Eclipse 4.3. When I first tried to run it, I got the same prompt to install a Java runtime as if I had no Java installed.\nSo I looked here on Apple StackExchange and found https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58841/52440. After running sudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_25.jdk /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk, I'm now able to launch Eclipse.\nHowever, when I try to launch other apps that require Java, such as /usr/share/java/Tools/Java VisualVM.app and /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/webstorm/6.0.2a/WebStorm.app, I get an error that no compatible Java 1.6 is available (see below).\n\nDoes anyone know if it's possible to get these other apps working, or do they really actually require Java 6 and can't work with Java 7?\n\nA: The dialog is shown because Oracle's Java has only partial 'JVMCapabilities' set and advertises itself as command-line-only capable.\nAs a superuser (use 'sudo' if editing in Terminal), you should edit /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk.1.7.[version-and-release].jdk/Contents/Info.plist and find the following key:\n<key>JVMCapabilities</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>CommandLine</string>\n  </array>\n\nand add it to include the missing values:\n<key>JVMCapabilities</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>CommandLine</string>\n    <string>JNI</string>\n    <string>BundledApp</string>\n  </array>\n\nAfter that, you have to either reboot, logout or killall Finder, what ever seems to work.

Where and how can I fix this?\n\nA: You are using multiple versions of Python simultaneously - one from Python.org (2.7.3), located in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/, which does not have an installation of pip associated with it, and another version from HomeBrew (2.7.5), located in /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/. Your pip script is using the /usr/local/... Python, which doesn't have the time module available for some reason, but when you just type python on the command line, the shell searches through your $PATH and runs the version in /Library/Frameworks/.... If you were to type /usr/local/bin/python on the command line and enter import time you will likely get an error. The time module is part of the Python standard library, so I'm not sure why homebrew isn't finding it - you might want to re-brew python to fix it.\nTo always run the homebrew version of python (if that's what you want your primary version to be), just put /usr/local/bin as the first entry in your $PATH variable.\n", "Q: How long should it take to charge up a new iPhone I just got a new 64 GB iPhone 5. I left it connected to my MacBook Pro all night last night via the USB cable. It's only about 85 percent charged.\nIs that normal? Seems like it should be charged up by now.\n\nA: No this is not normal.\nAn iPhone should not be using so much power overnight that a normal charge source cannot top it off in 4 hours.\nThe problems could be:\n\n\n*\n\n*stuck process on the CPU of the phone.\n\n*faulty hardware on the iOS side\n\n*insufficient charge from the USB\n\n\nYou can rule out the first by connecting the phone to charge and then powering it off. It will charge safely when powered off as the charge circuitry doesn't need the phone to be running.\nThe second problem might be a used up battery, a prematurely failing battery, damage to the internal charging circuitry.\nThe third problem could be as simple as the Mac not charging during hibernation (it would charge during sleep at 500mA level) or a bad cable or faulty port power. You can rule that out by charging from a proper wall adapter.\n\nA: My salesperson told me to use my iPad's charger to charge my iPhone. Because of the higher wattage it charges pretty quickly, in a matter of hours.\n\nA: That does sound very slow. Perhaps your MacBook Pro went to sleep after a period of no use, causing the charging to stop? How quickly does the phone charge while you're using your laptop?\n\nA: Your Macbook most likely went to sleep. When any computer goes to sleep, it will stop all connections through USB and Wifi and so on.\n", "Q: Transfer Apple Mail into Gmail I use Apple Mail and have:\nA) nearly 80,000 e-mails\nB) 10 different POP and iMAP e-mail accounts \nB) over 30 rules\nAny tips or resources for getting all my e-mails, accounts and rules transferred into Gmail? \n\nA: For the pop3 email accounts (if you've left the mail on the server), have you tried going to Settings > Accounts > Check mail from other accounts (using POP3): Add a POP3 mail account you own?\nWhen I migrated my mail a couple of years ago I set up gmail in the apple mail client using iMAP, and manually dragged things into gmail.

On iPhone 4 - I was at a wrestling show - low light, except for strobe/laser lighting in the distance - and I was unable to take clear pictures. I had to zoom in 100% as I was sat far away. The pics came out blurry at best (with or without flash) What can I do to get clearer pics?\n\nA: Aside from getting more light in the room, there's not really anything you can do. You can try using a third-party camera app, like Nightcap, to try and boost the capabilities of your phone, or Camera+, to modify your photos in post-production and possibly increase their fidelity (just as you could take your pictures into your PC/Mac and edit them in Photoshop). You will, however, be limited.\nUntil cell phone capabilities increase substantially, your options are few. My best advice is to try to get as close to your subject(s) as possible and attempt to capture as much light as possible. If you can rest the phone on something stable to minimize shake during long shutter speeds, do it. As rough as it can be, those are still the best ways to get good pictures in your situation.\nOh, and avoid zooming. You're usually better off taking a full picture and cropping in post.\n", "Q: How to get rid of all the .serverauth.$$ in the HOME directory on OS X? How to prevent gettin lots of  .serverauth.$$ files in the HOME directory on OS X 10.8?\n($$ is a pid number).\n\nA: You can prevent these from accumulating if you always exit the X11 server gracefully.  That means logging out gracefully and shutting down gracefully.  No way you can always do that though, so about all you can do is delete these every now and then.  You could write a script to find and remove the ones not in use and run it manually or schedule it to run routinely via cron.  Below is an example script:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd || {\n  echo \"Unable to cd to home.\" >&2\n  exit 1\n}\nCandidates=$(echo .serverauth.*)\nif [ -z \"$Candidates\" ];then\n  exit\nfi\nfor Candidate in $Candidates ; do\n  PID=${Candidate#.serverauth.}\n  kill -0 $Candidate 2>&-\n  if [ $? != 0 ];then # The PID is not currently active\n    printf \"Removing orphaned xserverauth file \\\"$Candidate\\\".\\n\";\n    rm $Candidate || {\n      printf \"Failed to remove file \\\"$Candidate\\\".\\n\" >&2.\n    }\n  fi\ndone\n\n\nA: In Terminal:\nrm .serverauth.*\n\nOr, if you want to remove from every home dir:\nsudo rm /Users/*/.serverauth.*\n\n", "Q: Hotkey switching between spelling dictionaries I'm often using 4 languages for writing texts.

This headset is known for having a very good a2dp profile built in and is advertised to allow one to stream music from one's smartphone in addition to taking calls. \nSo far the only app that has given me audio in the headset is Talkatone (a VoIP app). iTunes U, iTunes, google chrome, safari, and YouTube output audio through the iPad's speakers. \nHow do I configure any of these apps to use my headset for audio?\n\nA: My mistake.  I did consult the headset manual, which had one sentence about A2DP, which just said essentially \"it only works on phones that support it\".\nIn fact, all I had to do to move from where I was to the headset working as I expected was to force-close and reopen each iPad app that I wanted to hear through the headset.\n\nA: It sounds like only the phone profile was paired with the iPad. You probably need to pair the A2DP profile separately. Refer to the manual of the bluetooth headset, especially where it talks about pairing it to an iPod or any other music playing device.\nFor example, my Prius has both the phone profile and the audio profile. I must go through 2 separate pairings to get both of them to work. It is not enough to go through a single pairing of the phone capabilities and start having it play audio through my Music app. I am guessing something similar is happening with your bluetooth headset.\nAnother thing you can try is seeing where the audio currently goes when you use FaceTime. I would presume that it does work with the bluetooth headset because it is the closest thing to a phone call on an iPad.\n\nA: I had the same issue with my plantronics.  I removed the BT from my IPad, then reconnected.  It worked fine then.\n", "Q: How can I get the Navionics App for iphone to utilise a third party gps When I am outside of wifi and cell coverage, or even by choice, how can you use a third party GPS?\n\nA: From the frequently asked questions page, it appears Navionics has not tested third party GPS devices:\n\nQ.

Specially the one with the password, If it helps, I noticed it became tougher when I started to use WiFi connection and turned WiFi permanently on.\n\nEDIT: After OS X 10.9 Mavericks, the password issue has disappeared either on WiFi or not. Now I can open the laptop and immediately start typing my password and it accepts.\n\nA: Wired memory is memory that the Operating System has reserved for itself, and it cannot be written to disk.\nVM Memory is the amount of space on your disk that the system has allocated for virtual memory. This is slow, and one of the main reasons why running low of free RAM will bring your system to a crawl.\nPage ins / outs are when RAM memory is written to the disk (out) and when it is copied back from the disk into RAM (in).\nSwap is how much of the VM Memory the system is actually using.\nThis, and more, can also be found here: http://www.interrupt19.com/2009/06/15/os-x-memory-usage-explained/ and here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1342?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nMake sure you have enough free space on your disk for the OS to swap as needed. A good rule of thumb is that 10% of your total disk capacity should always be free. Furthermore, have you noticed any particular apps giving you trouble? Those tools you're using can be powerful for narrowing down what is causing your problem. Also, if you are running Chrome and Safari simultaneously, I suggest you only run them one at a time, as they both tend to be memory-hungry in my experience.\n", "Q: YouTube doesn't work on a brand new MacBook YouTube doesn't work in Safari on mid-2013 MacBook Air 13\".\nI've tried enabling HTML5 video at http://www.youtube.com/html5, and some videos did start playing after that, but most videos still don't work.\nWhat I've noticed is that if you're viewing a video that does in fact work, and go into the full-screen mode, then all subsequent videos (which are suggested after the original video ends) do work, but only whilst you're still within the full-screen mode -- as soon as you exit the full-screen mode, depending on the video, Adobe Flash might again be required right away, without any option of going back fullscreen.\nHow do I make YouTube work without Adobe Flash?

The short question is: if I have an app (Chrome) that keeps on crashing on app start up, how do I reinstall the app totally so it will run again?  (removing the app and download and reinstall won't work).\nThe long question is:\nI have an iMac on the top floor of the house, in California, and some days the thermometer showed a max temperature of 39C (which is 102F).   That day, when I see the Google Chrome window, I clicked on it, and it crashed.\nAt that time, the temperature of the room is probably around 36C.\nSo to prevent any further damage to the computer, I shut it down and wait until the next day in the morning to power the computer up again.\nBut now Google Chrome will start up and immediately crash.  I tried going to the Applications folder, delete the whole app, and use Firefox to download Google Chrome from the Internet again to install it.  But the same thing happened.  Install, reboot, app crashed.  Reboot again, run the app again, and it crashed again.  I reinstalled the app for about 3 times total.\nAnd since it might be related to the app setting data having some issue that caused the app to keep on crashing, I found the folder where the app data sits:  ~/Library/Application Support/Google, and I renamed it to ~/Library/Application Support/00G00gle and tried and removed the app and downloaded the app and reinstalled it.  But still it crashed.\nSo is there a way to totally reinstall the app in this case to make it work again?\n\nA: AppZapper allows you to remove all of the files associated with an application. The free version allows you to remove an app only 5 times, but check it out and see if it solves your issue.\n\nA: A great free app can help you delete an app and all of the files associate with it is AppCleaner. \nhttp://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/\n\nA: You could also try deleting ~/Library/Saved\\ Application\\ State/com.google.Chrome.savedState.

If I remove an external hard drive from my Mac, then re-introduce it a few weeks later, will Time Machine back it all up again as if it were a new drive, or will it just back up the changes that were made since the last time it backed up the drive?\n\nA: If this is a Time Machine disk, disconnecting it and then reconnecting it in the future will simply make Time Machine update it when it is plugged in as normal, meaning it will back up whatever has changed. It will not erase the drive and start from scratch. It will simply resume where it left off.\nOr do you mean that this external disk was one of the drives that Time Machine was backing up onto another, separate drive? If so, it seems that if you use that drive on another computer and then try to back it up with Time Machine again, it may cause some problems (or may not. Just depends.) Also, in a case where TM hasn't backed up a drive in a while, it may lose much of its cache for that disk and appear to be backing everything up again when you plug it back in. However, in this case it seems that it's not actually backing it all up, it's only really keeping what has changed. \n", "Q: What is the logind process, and why is it running?

TrueCrypt 7.1a is already installed on my MacBook with OS X 10.8.4. I plan to install OPENFUSE 2.6 and SSHFS 2.4.1, are they compatible with TrueCrypt?\n\nA: Yes, OS X 10.8.4-19.0.1 can use Truecrypt while osxfuse-2.6.2.dmg and SSHFS-2.4.1 are installed.\nAlso I did not observe any 'installation order issues'.\n", "Q: OS X status bar wifi icon - meaning of bars? On my MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac mini, the status bar includes the standard \"radiating sector\" wifi icon which you can click on to select a wifi network, or Option-click on to see additional info such as BSSID, Channel, RSSI, transmit rate.  The icon itself show 1, 2, 3 or 4 lines in black to indicate how good the wifi connection is.  My question is this - what do the different numbers of lines indicate?  Is it various thresholds in signal-to-noise ratio?  Transmit speed?  RSSI?  Bit-error rate?\nThe built-in WIFI Diagnostics app (I'm running Mountain Lion 10.8.4) tells me that RSSI is -65 to -70 dBm, noise is between -85 and -90 dBm, SNR is between 10 and 25, Quality is either Good or Excellent, and Tx Rate is between 1.0 and 11 Mbps.\nThe reason for asking is that I'm at the end of a pretty poor wifi connection right now, but the wifi icon is constantly showing all 4 lines in solid black!  Why?\n\nA: RSSI or Received signal strength indication is what is used for the display of the bars.\nThe higher the number ( closer to 0 ) the better your signal strength.\nFor Apple devices they used a scale of -100 to 0. But you'll never see 0, or even close. Most people will see a number between about -50 and -80, with around -50 being excellent. \n-50 will show all the bars and -90 will show gray bars. Not sure if it will go to -100 since you don't have a signal then ;)\nSo if you're asking for a scale I think its around 10 to 12.5 RSSI per bar.\nWhile you have a good signal strength, your throughput speed ( Tx Rate ) isn't that fast. \n\nOne method to calculate signal quality is to compute the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). SNR is the signal level (in dBm) minus the noise level (in dBm). Both of these values are typically represented as negative numbers. For example, a signal level of -53dBm and a noise value of -90dBm would yield an SNR of 37dB (i.e., SNR = Signal - Noise = -53 -(-90) = 37)\nThe calculated SNR value, as measured from a wireless client, would decrease as the range to the base station increases due to applicable free space loss. Also an increase in RF intereference from microwave ovens, cordless phones, walls, ceilings, etc, which would increase the noise level, would also decrease the overall SNR value.\nSNR Guideline\n40+dB = Excellent signal\n25dB to 40dB = Very good signal\n15dB to 25dB = Low signal\n10dB to 15dB = Very low signal\n5dB to 10dB = Little or no signal\n\nIn your case -65 - -90 = 25 or -70 - -85 = 15\nSo you have a 15db to 25db signal OR as diagnostics calls it SNR which isn't that good but isn't really bad either.\n\nA: As Apple is not very explicit on what it actually shows with the bars, I can only tell you my observations. First some Wi-Fi basics:\n\n\n*\n\n*The absolute signal strength, a power level measured in dBm or mWatt. It varies with the distance to the access point. In reality, the value is somewhere between -40 dBm (close to the AP) to -110 dBm (far away).\n\n*The RSSI (received signal strength indicator) value without unit. This value correlates loosely the signal strength. The mapping of RSSI value to absolute signal strength is defined by the HW vendor of the WiFi chip. (e.g. Atheros uses raw RSSI values 0..127, Broadcom 0..60) The larger the RSSI, the stronger the signal. Being able to handle different chip vendors with varying max raw RSSI, the OS might normalizes the raw RSSI to a normalized RSSI range e.g. 0..100 or 0..1000. Unfortunately, a lot of people (including Apple, see class CWInterface) mix the RSSI and the signal strength.\n\n*The noise level or noise floor measured in dBm or mWatt. It varies with the interference of other access points and other disturbers. The value is somewhere between -70 dBm (very noisy) and -100 dBm (almost no disturbers).\n\n*The SNR (signal to noise ratio) measured in dB or percent. It's the \"distance\" between the two power levels (signal - noise). The larger this value, the better the link quality; SNR larger than 25 dB is good to excellent. lower than 10 dB it starts to get very slow.\nFrom my experience in various environments (calm or noisy, close or far) it seems Apple shows the signal strength. Displaying SNR would correlate more to link \"quality\".\n\nA: What is shows is signal reception strength, which is the first must have, but does not guaranties fast connection, only that you could receive it.\nI would agree with you been on the very low end.\nHere is mine, no special (high speed wifi)\n\nSo here is a more detailed comparison, that shows why yours is not so good.\n\n", "Q: Print at smaller scale I recently received a PDF document consisting of 2 landscape A4 documents, which I would like to print as 1 portrait A4 (or 2 A5). I'm missing the control panel to print at 50% with matching layout. How can I do this on OS X?\n\nA: You can reduce size and fit to patch size with Preview (which is the default application for PDFs). In the print dialog, select paper size and adjustments as required:\n\n\nA: Thank for all your suggestions! With them, I found the following solution. A little disclaimer first: I don't have my Mac that long, and printing on a Mac was entirely new to me until last week. It can all be done without additional software on OS X 10.8.4, maybe on older version too (i don't know).\nFirst, open the the 'Show Details' pane (i totally missed that). \n\nThen, open the layout sub pane (1) and change 'Pages per Sheet' (2). The printer driver automatically scaled down the pages to fit. As you can see, this is a Brother MFC-J4410DW,  so maybe your mileage differs with another printer driver.\n\n", "Q: Sync all Photo Stream photos on iPhone I recently went to the apple store and got a replacement iphone 5 and with the new one I have decided to start fresh considering all the data I need is on icloud.\nAll my photos are on photo stream and I can see them all on my Mac in iPhoto but on my phone it has only synced a recent bunch of photos and not all of them.\nIs there a way to sync all of the photos that are on photo stream onto my phone without transferring the photos through iTunes?\nThanks!\n\nA: From Apple's Photo Stream FAQ:\n\nHow long are My Photo Stream photos stored in iCloud?\nThe photos you upload to My Photo Stream are stored in iCloud for 30 days to give your devices plenty of time to connect and download them.\nHow many photos are stored in My Photo Stream on my devices and computers?\niCloud pushes all your photos to the My Photo Stream album on your devices and computers, and manages them efficiently, so you don’t run out of storage space.\nYour iOS devices keep a rolling collection of your last 1000 photos in the My Photo Stream album. From there, you can browse your recent photos or move the ones you like to your Camera Roll or another album to keep them on your device forever.\n\nSo, you'll have to sync them in from iPhoto using iTunes, since Apple only keeps your photos for 30 days on their servers.\nYou could also find another app on the App Store like Documents by Readdle and copy the photos onto your phone over Wi-Fi (bypassing iTunes as you wanted) but I realize that's less than ideal.\n", "Q: Backup second iPhone to my PC How can I backup a second iPhone 4S to my PC? Both are backed up in iCloud but only one in iTunes store.\n\nA: When an iPhone is backing up to iCloud, iTunes doesn't automatically do a backup of the phone when it syncs.\nYou can, however, manually tell iTunes to back up the iPhone. When you connect the iPhone to iTunes, and you click on it and it opens to the summary page (where it tells you the name of the phone, and gives you the option to restore it and see home much space on it is used), there is a Backup button in the right side of that page.\nCheck out Apple's \"HT5262: Choosing an iOS backup method\" on Apple Knowledgebase. It talks about the benefits of iCloud backup, the benefits of iTunes backup, and then it talks about how to do both together.\n", "Q: Taking over old iPhone 4, updated to iOS 6, but can't activate? I have borrowed/taken-over my girlfriend's iPhone 4 that had iOS 4.x installed. She has changed phone carrier, so I don't have any active iPhone SIM card at present. \nAnyhow, I updated to iOS 6 and gave it a Wi-Fi connection for its configuration. However, it just states I should contact customer care, but I don't really believe I should need activation? The phone should not be locked as far as I know, but is that the problem? Or is it the change in iTunes account? \nI am not sure how to progress from here... So I am hoping someone here recognizes the problem, so I can explain the problem properly over phone and/or contact the right ones\n\nA: All you need is a SIM card in the phone while you activiate it first time after upgrade.

Is there any special/hidden setting to do it?\n\nA: You can disable the notifications using Notification Center. Please note that they will be disabled whether the app is opened or closed.\nOpen System Preferences, then select Notifications (upper right corner). You will then see a list of Apps which use Notification Center. Find Messages in this list. Set the \"Messages alert style\" to None.\n\nA: You can (temporarily) prevent the notification center from bothering you, by option-clicking the icon in the menu bar.  This will turn off all notifications, and not just the messages app.\n", "Q: What happens when I unsubscribe from iTunes Match? I know that for every song I have purchased from the iTunes store I can download it regardless and at any time. I was thinking of subscribing to iTunes Match to get a similar service for all the songs I have bought from other sources. I was thinking though, if I unsubscribe at a later date will I no longer be able to download the songs that I didn't purchase from apple through iTunes?\nOr will all my songs that are recognised by \"Match\" be classed as purchased through iTunes and available to download indefinitely?\n\nA: No, iTunes distinguishes your content gathered from outside the iTunes Store as either Matched up Uploaded. Matches means if found the song on iTunes while Uploaded means it could find the selected song but instead took your copy and placed it in the cloud. The benefit of the former is that Apple's copies are high quality AAC files and will replace your sometimes inferior lower bitrate MP3 in the cloud. At no time does the service concert any item to the \"purchased\" status however.\nOnce the service expires, Matched and Uploaded songs no longer can be downloaded indefinitely. The iTunes Match service is essentially the download portion of the service. Once you unsubscribe, you can no longer download any more songs from the service that have been marked as either Matched or Uploaded. Any song you downloaded while iTunes Match was active, you get to keep, though.\nMore information on iTunes Match can be found here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4914\n", "Q: What will registering an apple device a developer device do to it? I have an iPad 2 and I need a device to test my ios app on. I was wondering if their are any consequences to registering a device to be a developer device. For example, can I still use it as a regular device when I am not developing on it? Will I be able to use it regularly if I put iOS 7 on it?\n\nA: Still works fine. This will allow you to install you own Apps on the device for testing. Otherwise the only way's to get apps on you iOS device is Jailbreak or App Store.\n\nA: Registering an iPad to be a developer device just means that you can install your own compiled apps (which were built specifically for your device(s)), and run them.  You can run \"normal\" apps, acquired through the iTunes store, or any apps which were compiled for your iPad.\nWRT iOS7, be sure to read Apple's pre-release disclaimers.  (There's a section \"Read Me Before Downloading\" on the developer site).  Warnings about putting your device \"in an unusable state\" are there for a reason.  Unless you are writing apps that make specific use of new iOS features, you can still test new apps in iOS6.  And, the simulator is also a useful tool.\n", "Q: CoreStorageFamily::unlockVEKs() failed to unwrap the vek, status = e00002bc I have a filevault2 disk with two partition.

With this application I was able to install a custom resolution, and then I was able to use this external display at 1920x1200 without issue for almost a year until I upgraded OS X.\nAfter upgrading to 10.8, my custom resolution was lost. Again, the 1920x1200 resolution is not listed in OS X's System Preferences > Displays. The highest resolution I can use (with correct ratio) is now 1440x900, which is the same as the LCD screen on the MBP.\nSo I fired up SwitchResX to re-install the resolution, but I am now being nagged about my trial time expiring. When I select my display on the left hand side of SwitchResX, and open the Custom Resolutions tab, I see my resolution listed, but it always says Not installed under the Status column.\nSince this exact same hardware configuration worked under 10.7 (with the help of non-free third-party software), it seems like I should be able to get 1920x1200 from 10.8 as well. The only software workaround I knew (SwitchResX) has expired.\nIs there anything I can do with OS X to reclaim my monitor's native resolution? Or do I really have to resort to purchasing third-party software to support this seemingly common resolution?\n\nSystem specs:\nOS X 10.8.4, Intel Core i7, 4GB DDR3 RAM, AMD Radeon HD 6490M 256MB\n\nEdit - Bounty Details:\nI have Apple's Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter.

I've personally helped probably upwards of 20 people who have inadvertently zoomed in and have not known what they did or how to undo it.  I can only imagine that AppleCare phone support gets many calls about this, which I'm sure is difficult to figure out based on the descriptions people give.\nChanging the default behavior would kill off the majority of those calls for new 10.8 users who have no idea what the feature is for while leaving the option there for those of us that use it from time to time.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: What is the maximum time for delivering app binary to app-store?

Please upload app binary.\nBut, at the last time our client asks to change the designs of the project. I'm afraid how long the apple itunes connect will wait for upload.\nI like to know,\nWhat is the maximum time allowed by apple for delivering app binary to app-store?\nis there any warning or mails will be sent to me from apple-inc about this?\n\nA: You have nearly 6 months(180 days) time to upload the binary.\nAs per Apple developer documentation,\n\n150 Day Warning. You will receive an email when you have had an app created for 150 days but have not yet delivered a binary,\n  reminding you that you have 30 more days to deliver your binary or\n  your app will be deleted from iTunes Connect. You will be given an\n  exact date of your deadline in this email.\n173 Day Warning. You will receive an email when you have had an app created for 173 days but have not yet delivered a binary,\n  reminding you that you have 7 more days to deliver your binary or your\n  app will be deleted from iTunes Connect. You will be given an exact\n  date of your deadline in this email.\n180 Day Deletion Confirmation. You will receive an email confirming that your app has been deleted from iTunes Connect, if you\n  have not delivered a binary before your 180-day deadline.\n\n\nA: It's stated under the iTunes Connect Developer Guide that:\n\nAfter creating your app and it is in the state Prepare For Upload or Waiting For Upload, you have 180 days (6 months) from your creation date in iTunes Connect to deliver a binary to Apple. If you do not deliver a binary before the 180-day deadline, your app is deleted from iTunes Connect. As a result of this deletion, your app name can be used by another developer and you cannot reuse the app name, SKU or bundle ID.\n\nAll admin and technical iTunes Connect users on the developer's account will receive two warning emails as the expiration date approaches and one confirming the deletion of the App from iTunes Connect, once the 180 days deadline has been reached. \nThe first warning email will be sent when your App has been created for 150 days and no binary has been uploaded. The second and last warning will be sent when 173 days have passed.\n\nA: The 180 day limit has gone.\nToday I got this lines from Apple after asking for some more time... :)\n\nWe no longer have the requirement to use an app name within a designated time period.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to take the app name again after the app got deleted from iTunes-connect? Since we can have 180 days time for app binary submission, After that window expires the application will be deleted from the itunes-connect.\nThen is it possible to create another application with the same name?\nie, is there any possibilities for apple to give the same name to the same user after deletion of the app?\n\nA: No, once and App has been deleted, either by you or because of the expiration process, you cannot reuse your SKU or app name in the same account again. It can be used, though, by another developer.\nUnder the Deleting an App section of the iTunes Connect Developer Guide you'll learn more about the ramifications of an App Deletion.\n\nA: Apple will not allow to create a new app with the same name that you have created and deleted earlier.\nYou can refer what Apple Developer site is telling about this issue.\n\nA: You will be able to re-upload the app under the same name by choosing a different default language after deleting it. This might as well be a bug in iTunes Connect though and I wouldn't be surprised if they were to fix it some day. \nTo be safe, simply update your app with the new version - even an entirely new project.\n\nA: As of 2021, the accepted answer is not valid anymore.\nApps can be \"Removed\" instantly and the name can be taken instantly by another app (even from the same developer account).\nSee https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev28d17ed35\n", "Q: Update for iPod touch 3rd generation Hi I have a pretty tough question it's because all my friends text with imessage and I feel kinda left out is there a way ANY WAY that I could get imessage on my iPod touch 3G     There is this boy at my school that has it on his touch 3\n\nA: Yes, you can get iOS 5 on iPod Touch 3G, which includes the iMessage application. However,  make sure that you truly have an iPod Touch 3G and not an iPod Touch 2G, which can only be updated to iOS 4.2.1. According to this link from Wikipedia, iPod Touch 3G can go up to iOS 5.1.1.\n", "Q: What chargers are compatible with A1226? I need to buy a power supply for my A1226 15-inch Macbook Pro (2007), but I can't find any anywhere. Apple's online store, ebay, or amazon. So I'm wondering if the charger doesn't have to be the one for your specific model. I found this charger that says that it's for Macbooks and 13-in Macbook Pros. It's 60W, so I'm guessing that it'll work. Will it?\n\nA: For your mac you'll need a 85W power adapter like that one.\n", "Q: Map Fn + Esc key to Esc key I am using a PC keybroad on a Mac, the funniest thing is on this KB, to use the Esc key, I need to press Fn + Esc\nSo, are there any tool I can remap the keys such that I can use the Esc without the Fn key?\n\nA: Fn is a function of the keyboard that modifies the key-codes being sent by the keyboard itself. Fn itself does not transmit any key-codes to the computer.\nOne option would be to try mapping the actual key (that is turned into Esc when Fn is pressed) to be the Esc key. I don't know of anything built into OS X that will do this across the board, however, you could try something like https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/\nTo be honest, good keyboards are so cheap these days you should probably just buy yourself a nice new keyboard that has a layout which suites your needs better.\n\nA: The esc key is marked on my keyboard with a ◻︎ (square icon), as it acts as the \"home\" button when used with a phone or tablet. Unforgivably, on a Mac, it does not send keypress events unless activated by the fn key.\nI pried up the esc key and reattached it where the F5 key used to sit. Then I mapped the F5 key to 'escape' using Karabiner-Elements.\nSo I had to relearn where the esc key sits, but at least I don't need to press two keys to escape.\n", "Q: Are replacement iPhone 5's unlocked? I got a free replacement for my damaged iPhone 5 at my local Apple Store. I watched the clerk take a SIM card out of the old iPhone and pop it into the new one, which surprised me because I thought Sprint iPhones didn't use SIM cards. \nCan my replacement phone be used with another carrier? What about a carrier that, like Sprint, uses CDMA, for example Verizon?\n\nA: Even CDMA iPhones have a SIM slot. They aren't required for use on carriers that support the network protocol, but rather are used for roaming on other networks (GSM). Apple truly built a \"worldphone.\"\nTo answer your questions, no, your phone is locked to the carrier it was purchased through. That applies to both the SIM (GSM) and the CMDA networks. Even though carriers like Sprint that don't operate on GSM still lock it down. And I assume they do sell SIM cards for roaming purposes. \nAdditionally, the replacement phone Apple gives you is indeed unlocked, which a twist. It locks itself to the first SIM card it detects. If you replaced your Sprint SIM card with one from AT&T and brought in your phone, the replacement they give you would then work (and only work) on that network as soon as the SIM was inserted as iOS had a chance to activate itself. \nThis makes sense as Apple wouldn't keep replacement stock for different carriers (that would be inefficient).\nThere's a monstrously long thread on MacRumors regarding this topic and ultimately, the conclusion was that the phones where indeed locked, just like their GSM brethren: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1246693\n\nA: I can't comment on the unlocked part of your question but I can answer your Sprint part of things...\nApparently, the iPhone does have a SIM when used on Sprint's network even though it's a CDMA carrier. The SIM portion is used only for travelling internationally.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/16486131#16486131\n\nA: There are different part numbers for the different carriers, size, and color (i.e., 3 carriers, 2 colors, 3 capacities = 18 different replacement parts from which to choose).\nSo, the phone that the technician had in his hand was already destined for Sprint. It probably wasn't ever unlocked. Sorry.\n\nA: The SIM card is there so you can still use your phone when outside of the United States. Your phone will roam to an international GSM operator, as basically nowhere else in the world uses CDMA.\nCDMA phones are generally intended only for use by the carrier they were sold by. It's conceivable that you could get Verizon to let a Sprint phone on to their network, but their policies don't allow for devices sold through other providers to be used on their networks.\n", "Q: Can I make a retina iPad display websites at full resolution? In other words, can I make it appear to the web server as if the device is 2048x1536 pixels and device-pixel-ratio 1?\nI'm happy to pay for an app that does does this if there is one…\n\nA: I believe this could be a problem with how sites are interpreting the User-Agent string and are assuming that it's an older iPad / mobile device.\nTry using the Google Chrome browser and it's \"Request Desktop Version\" feature.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/chrome/id535886823\n", "Q: Rescue Shortcuts for \"Frozen\" OS X? Though it doesn't happen often, I sometimes find myself in the situation where OSX will not respond to any commands.\nThe last time this happened I was closing a fullscreen VM - the app went away but then I was on an empty screen and wasn't able to switch away (the mouse still worked but not the brightness/volume keys).\nIs there any way to escape from such a situation other than holding the power key?\n(I only found a few shortcuts that are supposed to force quit but none of them worked. Some mentioned an \"EJECT\" key which I do not have on my MacBook Pro keyboard.)\n\nA: From the article at http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3411\nPress Command-Option-Esc to force quit, it brings up a dialog so you can choose which app to quit.\nCommand-Option-Shift-Esc for three seconds will force quit the front-most application.\nHere is another helpful article: http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/02/force-quit-mac-apps/\n", "Q: Use Airplay Mirroring and Airplay Speakers at the same time on iPhone Is it possible to use AirPlay mirroring for the video output and AirPlay speakers for audio at the same time? Unfortunately, the AirPlay menu available in the dock only allows me to select one device at a time.\nThank you.\n\n\nA: For iTunes content you may use Apple's Remote app to send signal to multiple sources at once.\nFor local content for Apple TV 2nd and 3rd generation on latest firmware you might try sending AirPlay stream to AppleTV and then choose your Airplay enabled speaker for sound output in AirPlay Preferences on AppleTV itself. It will only work for 2.0 (Stereo) sound.\n", "Q: Locating A WiFi Network Password Within OS X That Has Been Saved On My Mac? Is it possible to locate a wifi network password in OS X of a wifi hotspot that I may have used in the past (AFAIK wifi networks are saved), in the rare situation that I may need to see it (to share it for example) ?\n\nA: If you have saved it previously, open Keychain Access (located in /Applications/Utilities or via Spotlight) and search for the wifi network name.\nIf you have found it, check the lowest checkbox to reveal the password. You need your login password to do so.\n", "Q: Forcing use of SSL connections in web dependent applications Many websites allow it, to use an SSL connection. But how can I force my web dependent applications (Safari e.g.) to establish such a more secure (I know, that SSL is not the solution for all security related problems) connection, and to fallback if it isn't possible?\n\nA: A preliminary before getting to a solution: I think you would be unhappy with a solution which tried https with every site.  For sites which do not respond to https there would an unacceptable delay waiting for some timeout period before trying again with http.   \nMy solution for you is GlimmerBlocker.  This a proxy server running on your Mac.  As a result all web applications connect via GlimmerBlocker.  Though frequently used as an ad blocker, it has much more functionality including rewriting web requests or returning a redirect to your browser.\nHere is a description of the Request and Response Flow inside GlimmerBlocker including how URLs can be modified.  Pretty sparse description, but can you started.\nThe first post in this blog has a more detailed recipe for converting http requests to https.  This can be applied to specific web sites which you know do support https as well as http.\nUsing GlimmerBlocker beyond what is out of the box is not for the fainthearted, but it has the power to do almost everything conceivable to web requests.\n\nA: You might be interested in the HTTPS Everywhere project from EFF.\n\nHTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox and Chrome extension that encrypts your\n  communications with many major websites, making your browsing more\n  secure.\n\nThere does not appear to be any support for Safari.\n", "Q: Identifying PowerPC applications that will not work on OS X releases beyond Snow Leopard? I understand the issue with migrating away from the Snow Leopard release of OS X to anything newer is that applications compiled for the PowerPC architecture will no longer function.\nIs there a way to identify applications that are PowerPC-based without opening each and every application and looking at Activity Monitor? It would be great to know in advance which ones need updating so I can check if they've been recompiled for the x86 architecture.\n\nA: I don't have a Snow Leopard install handy but this info is available in System Profiler...\nApple Menu > About > More Info\nIn the resulting app there should be a way to view the installed applications.  In that list there will be a column \"Kind\" that will state \"Intel\", \"Universal\" or \"PPC\".\nScreen shot of how this looks in Mountain Lion: (may look different in Snow Leopard, but idea is the same.)\n\n", "Q: restarting a airport from the commandline - of a non-mac We have a few airport's and an airport express here at my work, and I would like to bring them into my Nagios monitoring more closely. Right now they are only being monitored by ping. I would very much love to be able to ssh to it as we do to the other WAP's, so that I could monitor the users connected and maybe even some basic signal quality stuff, but other answers are getting me thinking that ssh just isn't an option for the Airports.\nOne thing I have found is a couple of posts referencing networksetup. From what I can tell it seems to give some degree of function not only for getting information out of the router, but also performing actions such as a restart. The one problem is - it's obviously a binary only available on the mac terminal.\nI can't co-opt one of the few macbook pro's we have just to proxy requests to the Airports, and I'm not aware of a way to virtualize OSX. Does anyone know of a port of the networksetup command for some other distribution (if it was ubuntu it would be ++good)? Or perhaps an alternative solution to be able to get basic information from and perform basic actions on an airport (I really can't think of any actions needed other than the restart).\nEdit: I just got momentarily excited when I saw that there was a airport-utils package - sadly it would appear that this does not support any command line options, it's GUI only.\n\nA: You're asking a lot of different stuff here.\nHere's the question I am going to try to answer:\n\"How can I bring my Airport devices into my Nagios monitoring more closely?\"\nOK so first of all, Nagios supports SNMP and (most?) Airport devices support SNMP.  So \"all\" you have to do is configure the Airport SNMP settings and then set up Nagios to ingest the data.\nUnfortunately the current version of the Apple's Airport Utility (6.3.1) removed the interfaces to the SNMP settings in the Airport.  You can still download the old version (5.6.1) from Apple but the installer for the old version of the Airport Utility refuses to run on Mountain Lion! However it turns out that it is only the installer that is broken in ML!\nSome crazy genius has written and made available an Automator workflow that works around this and allows you to install the old version of Airport Utility.  I just tried it and it worked.  Was then able to use it to set the SNMP settings of my Airport devices.\nIf this ends up working for you and you accept my answer, you should consider rewriting the question so that the question and the answer match.\n", "Q: Kernel panic: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily I am having repeated kernel panics.

I don't know the details, but the system only crashed while connected, and I verified a brand new out of the box mac crashed on the display as well. A new display solved the problem for me.\nI appreciate the troubleshooting info, but i'd already done the obvious. I uninstalled all kernel extension and almost all software. It wasn't a software issue (well, not a 3p software issue).\n\nA: The issue of repeated panics is serious, and there are no utilities than can diagnose them. But there are steps the user can take. \nApple has a support page, About Kernel Panics.\nMacworld has an article, How to Troubleshoot a Kernel Panic.\nWhile posting panic logs may seem helpful, in reality not many can read them. Instead, post the details of hard- and software and what you are doing when they happen. Specifically, your log indicates that a java program was running at the time of the crash. Can you shut down java or dig into what might be happening when these repeated crashes happen?\n\nA: I fixed this error today (com.apple.iokit.IOACPIFamily 1.2.0) using Disk Warrior Boot disk>Rebuild feature. I have no idea what exactly was wrong (due to the fact that kernel panic logs don't make any reliable sense to me) but there were errors/discrepancies on my drive. The drive is healthy with 12,000 poh. \nI also ran a file check with Disk Warrior. Boots good now. \n", "Q: 10px~ gap between application and dock When I set my apps to fullscreen with the taskbar still there, it doesn't truly fullscreen the application, it always has that small little border to the left.\nI'm using moom as a window resizer, but even without it, I still get the same problem. Is this a setting somewhere? My dock is on the left as well.\n\nsame problem here\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2143319?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: It is actually 4px on non-retina displays.\nI have tried using gdb and strings to find preference keys for removing the gap, but I haven't found anything. Most windows can't be resized so that they cover it with AppleScript either.\nThe only way I know to remove it is to disable Dock completely with for example launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Dock.plist. But it also disables Mission Control, Launchpad, full screen windows, and the application switcher, and it makes desktop backgrounds gray.\nA more practical workaround might be to make the desktop background (or parts of it on the side the Dock is on) solid black.\n", "Q: How to Move Photos out of an Event and into the Main section of iphoto? I have created many events over the years of having my mac... and I am noticing that my events are becoming very jumbled from importing photos over the years and just tossing them into the closest relative event I can find.. I am wanting to have all my photos in the basic part of iphoto without any events.. so that I can recreate ALBUMS that appropriately file my pictures so I can find them easily when I need them.\nCan anyone assist me with this?\nThanks :) \n\nA: Events are an integral part of iPhoto.\nYou can't have no events. However, you can ignore them. Just select 'Photos' on the left side list:\n\n(iPhoto remembers your selection and will display the 'Photos' view next time you start it) and configure the time frame iPhoto should use to autosplit photos into events (I use an 8-hour gap):\n\niPhoto won't bother you about creating new events.\nNow you can group your pictures in albums: in the 'Photos' view, select the photos you want to include in an album and press ⌘N. A new, unnamed album that contains the previously selected photos will appear in the Albums list. Rename it and you're done.\nNote that iPhoto won't automatically add imported photos to your albums. If you want your albums to be updated based on certain criteria use smart albums instead.\n", "Q: How do I update my jailbroken Apple TV to 5.3?

I have a bit of an edge use-case of QR codes.

I have to reprocess the notes afterward into protocol or minutes and most of the time my notes not only contain text but also sketches or diagrams. \nI tried to use mind map tool or word processing software to take my notes, but I don't like to have my laptop open between me and my customer. I would like to use an iPad with a dedicated pen and software (with hand writting recognition). My colleague use a Lenovo tablet, which I find is way too thick to confortably write on a table. \nMy questions are not related to the software / pen, but on the handling and usability of the iPad solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*Who is using an iPad daily for taking hand notes and sketches? If yes, what are the inconvenience?\n\n*Is it possible to work paper free?\n\n*What are the reasons why this tool cannot be used for taking notes?\n\n*What about the comfort compared to a sheet of paper and a real pen when taking notes during a 2 hours meeting?\n\n\nA: The digitizer and hardware for iPads is generally reviewed as superior to any competing technology in terms of being able to run a native app for 10+ hours and capture the fine details of drawing and handwriting.\nWhere people tend to disagree is on what workflow you implement in terms of writing recognition and integration with existing tools. Even if you could earn money as a professional painting multiple magazine covers for the New Yorker using an iPad (or even iPhone), some people might not find the iPad the best tool for their work notes. You can't argue with the cost and efficiency of paper and pencil for note taking and you would want to be sure your time saved would be worth the amortized cost of the iPad and the training and software selection time you need to invest to become proficient with a new tool.\nThere's not likely going to be an answer that fits all potential iPad buyers.\n", "Q: How to configure client OS X VPN (L2TP) connection so you do not loose access to intranet? I am looking for a solution for configuring the VPN on OS X so you do not loose access to internal network. \nIn fact I want to use the VPN only to enable access to different external services that are cut by the firewall. \nOne example would be to enable TeamViewer which, is cut by the corporate firewall. VPN works, but when the VPN is enabled, the access to internal network is lost, and I don't want this.\n\nA: You will need to configure the Routes of the VPN connection. This is a bit advanced and needs some fiddling with the connections.\nTheres a guide here\nhttp://www.constrainedrandom.com/2011/mac-os-vpn-routing/\nYou can also lookup other posts for \"Custom VPN Routing\"\n", "Q: Google Drive for OS sometimes unable to connect (not a problem in latest versions) \nTHis is not a problem in the latest versions of Google Drive sync anymore\n\nSometimes Google drive for OS X turns gray telling it is unable to connect. The only cure is quit and launch again and it immediately starts to work. \nThe Resume in menu is inactive. \nWhat causes the problem? How to fix it?\n\n\nA: Quitting Google Drive and then restarting the App seems to work\n\nA: If you are using a MacBook, you are most likely experiencing this error because Google Drive has a tendency to have connection problems when the computer is woken from sleep. I noticed this happening to me on several occasions when I open my computer up in class, particularly when the wifi takes a while to connect.\nAlthough there is not much you can do about the bug itself, I have found that it is much less likely to happen if other internet-connected apps open.\n\nA: I am a windows user but I experienced the same problem. I was able to solve the problem by changing the settings on the Preferences.\nClick the Google drive icon on your task bar then click the settings (three horizontal dots icon), click Preferences, click the Advanced Tab then change Proxy settings to direct connection if you're not using proxy, then change the Bandwidth settings Download rate from don't limit to what is appropriate for you, mine was 100 KB/second.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: \"What causes the problem?\"\nThere's either a bug or an omission of code in the Google Drive macOS app that stops the app from re-connecting after it has lost its connection to Google servers.\n\"How to fix it?\"\nYou can't. The app is obviously supposed to re-connect after losing connection - it's a synchronisation app. You can't help losing your internet connection - your device might go to sleep, or your Wi-Fi might be unstable. All you can do pray they fix the bug in an update. There is no \"good\" answer here; blame Google for abandoning its broken software (see also: Android File Transfer for Mac).\n\nA: Quitting and re-opening the app works for me.

I gave my iPhone 4 to my daughter and she keeps charging to my Apple account. She signs in with her own Apple ID, but I keep getting charged for apps she is buying.\n\nA: Go to app store, then at the bottom of the Featured page you will see the Apple ID which is used in it. She might still be using yours.\nSigning with her Apple ID to iCloud is not related to the store. Your account might still be there.\n\nA: Take your credit card off her apple ID.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4062900?start=60&tstart=0\n\nA: Note that the iPhone's Settings app has two places to specify Apple IDs: Settings > iCloud and Settings > iTunes & App Stores (that's the layout as of iOS 6).\nEnsure that the latter setting contains your daughter's Apple ID and not your own.\n\nA: When buying apps that cost she can probably be using your credit card number..\n", "Q: Is there a full list of FN-key mappings for the MacBook Pro?

Instead the shortcut is set to the vim shortcut which is '$' to navigate to the end of a line. I a using bash. How can I get the standard vi shortcuts?\n\nA: Ctrl-a for beginning of line and Ctrl-E for end of line are Emacs shortcuts, not vi. As such, they will not work in vi.\n\nA: set -o vi\n\nAdd that to your ~/.bashrc\n\nIf you meant to write \"I cannot use the standard bash shortcuts Ctrl-E and Ctrl-A in vim\", then add these lines to your ~/.vimrc\nmap <C-E> $\nmap <C-A> 0|\n\nIf you want these to also work in input insert mode, you also need\nmap! <C-E> <esc>A\nmap! <C-A> <esc>0i\n\nThese maps for CtrlA send you to the left margin.

For instance, I have four friends with birthdays today, but only one is on my calendar.  I tried deleting and re-adding my Facebook account but notice no difference.\nI'm getting the exact same behavior on my iPhone.  \nMaybe this isn't a Mac issue.  Did Facebook change the way its sync works?\n\nA: Facebook has an option for friends to Opt OUT of their birthdays being displayed to other people. So if I had you on FaceBook and I turned the option off to display to you what my Birthday is, the it won't sync to your Calendar. \n", "Q: How to get Quick Look to print PDF files double-sided? My default printer's default settings are to print double-sided. It works well in all apps, due to system-wide preferences… with the exception of Quick Look: when I open a file with Quick Look (pressing space bar in Finder), then ask it to print (Command-P), it does not open a dialog and send it directly to the printer, one-sided.\nHow can I configure this behavior? Or is there another shortcut to get the behavior I want?\n\nA: If you are on Mountain Lion when u use quick-look and press Command-P to print the document. The \"Quick-look App\" actually opens the document in \"Preview App\" and make a simple print.\nI advise you to open the document in preview directly to print it double-sided.\n", "Q: Why are my contacts not working?

We use the Java Network Launch Protocol to load up our applications at work, but it's failing for our Mac users now.  I VNC'd into my test Mac to give it a test, and it appears that nothing happens at all.  In the past, if Java wasn't installed it would give the install option, and if it was install it would to a launch.  Now the URL bar just flashes and goes back to the previous website.  Appears that perhaps some recent OS X update has broken this functionality.  How can I re-enable it?\n\nA: Quick and easy solution is to utilize an alternate browser. I had a similar issue with a Keyboard Video Mouse switch that required Java in order to initiate a JNLP (Java Web Start) session. After installing various versions of Java (1.6, 1.7, etc.) (O.S. is Mountain Lion) and trying to start a JNLP session in Safari (Version 6.0.5, [8536.30.1]) would see the efforts subsequently fail. I installed Google Chrome (Version 28.0.1500.71) and tried to initiate a JNLP session and it worked fine. Firefox may or may not work equally as well but I did not test beyond Google Chrome.\n", "Q: Turn on/off WiFi via Mute switch I have jailbroken my iPad for firewall, XBMC and some development things only.\nI didn't know before that on the right-hand side near the volume buttons is a switch. In settings I have two options for it: lock screen rotation or mute. I don't need either of them, but I've got an idea on my mind - how about to turn on/off WiFi with this switch? (To save some battery.)\nIs there a mod or something that lets me do so?\n\nA: Activator\nYou could try a custom action using Activator, set up to toggle WiFi when the Silent switch is double-toggled. \nI am currently not jailbroken myself (running iOS 7) and haven't used Activator for a while, but I remember that there is an option to activate an action by double-toggling the mute switch, as can be seen in the screenshot below.\nThere may be a way to activate it using a single toggle, but I am not able to find this out myself right now. Despite this, a double-toggle returns the toggle to its original point, meaning that you could use the toggle for WiFi and orientation/mute at the same time (a single toggle doesn't activate the double-toggle action).\n\n", "Q: Where on my pc does iTunes store the backup? I backup my phone to iTunes but need to back up my pc.  I can do pictures as I can just copy those from the phone but what about the contacts, texts etc that are backed up to iTunes? Where is that stored?\n\nA: From Locate backups of your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch:\n\niTunes places the backup files in the following places:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\n  \n*Windows XP: \\Documents and Settings\\(username)\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\nNote: To quickly access the Application Data folder, click Start, and choose Run. Type %appdata% and click OK.\n  \n*Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10: \\Users\\(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\nNote: To quickly access the AppData folder, click Start. In the search bar, type %appdata% and press the ↩ Return key.\n\n\nA: For Windows 7 & 8 (from my knowledge):\n\n\n*\n\n*Start iTunes and attach the iPhone.\n\n*Click on your phone icon and then select the Info tab on the top menu.\n\n*Note the drop down menu SYNC CONTACTS WITH.\n\n*Choose Windows Contacts.\n\n*Make sure everything else is unchecked.\n\n*Then go ahead sync your phone.\n\n*This creates and or updates a Contacts Folder in your Windows User's folder called Contacts.\n\n*The info in here looks similar to a file but the columns show contact info.\n\n*Select an entry and OPEN IT (double click or right click and choose open.) - An edit window opens. When you sync the Windows Contact folder and your iPhone you will be able to get a pretty cool reconciliation feature for the differences between the two lists.\n\n*This works well and I know I have my contacts on my computer and backed up with all my other stuff.\n\n", "Q: What size SSD would suffice for basic software-development / productivity? My friend is selling me his old MacBook (Glossy white finish with rounded edges and corners) cheap for a Mobile Development course I'm taking, but he's keeping the hard drive.

I need to have a feel for the smallest SSD I can get\n\nA: A 128GB SSD would have enough room for what you list, with room to spare. A 256GB SSD, imho, would not cost that much more, and would give you more flexibility. \nBe aware that the version of Xcode needed to develop for iOS 7 requires Mountain Lion, and ML may not support that machine.

My only solution was to connect via HDMI cable instead of the Thunderbolt/DVI cable.  That works.\n", "Q: How might text be selected while typing the login password on my Mac? When I wake up my Mac I am presented with the login screen. I begin typing my password in the empty password text box. \nAfter typing the first few characters, the password text becomes highlighted (selected) somehow thereby causing the next character I type to delete those selected characters. \nFor example, say my password is \"password123\"\n\n\n*\n\n*I press power and my Mac wakes up I type \"passw\"\n\n*The password text becomes selected somehow\n\n*I finish typing \"ord123\" and hit enter\n\n*The password is incorrect since I am left with \"ord123\" in the password input box\n\n\nWhy is this and/or how can I prevent this from happening? \n\nA: I know the behaviour you describe. In my case, I wake up my Mac by pressing a key and I just wait for a few secs before entering the password. The key I pressed to wake up my Mac and if I press any others in that first couple of seconds (I am often impatient to get my computer to wake up!) will get selected as you describe.\nI think this is intentional behaviour by Apple, that any character typed before the password field is displayed and working is not treated as part of the password to be entered & so are deleted. The behaviour though is not a good user experience. I think a better experience should be that the characters typed before the text field is ready should not be added to the text field when it is ready, thus making it clear that characters entered before the text field is ready are ignored. The adding them & then selecting & deleting behaviour is just odd.\nMy answer I suppose is this. After waking your computer, just wait a couple of secs before entering your password. I've just learnt to do that without thinking about it because it works. But your right & if you have the enthusiasm report it as a bug to Apple.\n\nA: Does your Mac have a SSD (Solid State Drive) or Flash Storage?\nI have a Macbook Pro that had this problem, and the only way to truly fix the issue was to upgrade it to a SSD. Solid State Drives resume from sleep faster than a hard disk drive, and hard disk drives will always lag a little when resumed from sleep. One thing to try to make it slightly faster would be to open up Disk Utility, select the name of your drive (Macintosh HD most likely), and select each of the buttons (please wait for each to finish and then click the next one):\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify Disk\n\n*Repair Disk\n\n*Verify Disk Permissions\n\n*Repair Disk Permissions\n\n\nOnce you do that, restart your computer and see if it helps to decrease your resume times.\n\nA: This problem come from the order in which 2 important operations are scheduled to read a sensitive piece of information which is a password:\n\n\n*\n\n*lock exclusive access to the keyboard\n\n*read characters typed at the keyboard\n\n\nApparently these 2 operations are scheduled the wrong way round:\n\n\n*\n\n*read characters typed at the keyboard\n\n*lock exclusive access to the keyboard\n\n\nThe part of the kernel in charge of reading the keyboard is waken up before locking the keyboard. This is fully understandable when you want to be able to wake the system on any keyboard entry. But in such a case,\na mechanism should clearly indicate to the user when the keyboard\nis safe to type a serious password and not wake up noise.\nThis wrong scheduling was apparently a small problem and not noticed by many users since the 2 operations are anyway scheduled in a small window of events (it's a question of one or 2 seconds here).\nThis small window of time to schedule these 2 operations is larger if\nyou are just waking up your disk, or if your disk isn't fast enough\nfor your fingers, or if you have too fast fingers.\nThis is the reason why some people thought that this problem was created by hard disk drive (HDD) and suppressed by solid state drive (SSD). In fact the problem isn't suppressed by an SSD, it is just more difficult to exhibit. You should consider this as a fundamental bug\nin password reading which is hidden when using a fast enough disk or slow motion fingers.\n\nA: One responder here mentioned only having this problem when using LogMeIn.  For me, the problem would come up whenever I was using Splashtop (another remote-access tool) to access my computer.\nThe problem went away when I turned off the \"Enable blank screen\" pref (in the Security tab of the Splashtop prefs). Turning that off fixed a few other problems I was having with Splashtop also. I don't think that feature is completely ready yet...\nAnyway, I hope that helps someone else that may be using Splashtop.\n", "Q: What's the most recent Mac that will run Leopard?

Multiple users can login remotely to use the machine. Whenever someone logs in remotely, the physical monitor that is connected to the server and sits on my desk turns on, and I can see everything that the user is doing. I can even interfere with their work if I want by moving the physical mouse that is connected to the server, or typing on the physical keyboard that is connected to the server.\nUpdate July 30 2013 If I log in to the local monitor, a remote user can log in and see my screen / hijack my session in the same way that i (locally) can take over their session (remote). Something seems very wrong with that. What settings need to be changed?\nHow can I stop this behavior? It represents a security risk (other users may not want me viewing their activity, or hijacking their mouse/keyboard), and frankly it's distracting to have someone else's screen/activity going on my desk.\nI've messed with a bunch of settings in system preferences, and poked around Ask Different (How to Screen Sharing / VNC to an iMac without waking the display? is close, but still unsolved) for a while, haven't found a solution that works.\nPhysically turning off the monitor doesn't help, since it 'wakes' up whenever there is activity.

Post-10.7, Mac OS X VNC supports logging in and either sharing the current desktop, or generating a new virtual desktop.  \nHOWEVER, I believe if you're logging in as the same user that's currently logged in, it will take over the computer as though you were accessing it directly.  The solution would then be to create separate users for everyone who accesses the server.\nHere's some info about the VNC options.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: There is a tool called \"Screens\" which sports a curtain mode, blocking the locally attached screen from showing anything you're doing remotely. It may require specifically their software to run to access the machine remotely, but does seem to address your issue. \nhttp://edovia.com/screens/\n\nA: A more convenient solution than logging into another user could be the Shades preferences pane which allows you to dim the screen to a degree where it's not noticable that it's on. Combined with muting the audio after remotely connecting this allows you to login to an already logged on user without concern to others. However the security and privcacy concerns remain so it's not ideal.\n", "Q: Navigate to a certain tab and close that tab in OSX Terminal I've got multiple terminal tabs open, and I want to be able to close the current tab.

This will allow you to switch between active tabs.\nWhen on the tab you wish to close, as you noted, ⌘+w will close that tab.\n\nA: If you're trying to do it in a script, you might use something like this:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    repeat with w in (get windows)\n        repeat with t in (get tabs of w)\n            if processes of t contains \"man\" then\n                set selected of t to true\n                set index of w to 1\n            end if\n            --properties of t\n        end repeat\n    end repeat\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Terminal\"\n    perform action \"AXRaise\" of window 1\n    tell menu 3 of menu bar 1\n        if enabled of menu item \"Close Tab\" then\n            click menu item \"Close Tab\"\n        else\n            click menu item \"Close Window\"\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nTab objects don't have a close command. set index to 1 doesn't actually raise a window, but it makes it it appear as window 1 to System Events, which supports the AXRaise action.\n", "Q: How do I Assign Contacts to iCloud? I'm discovering the Contacts process is a mess.  Even worse, it all looks pretty cool, the hidden complications can mess you up.  Read on. \nI've learned the default account can be set to either iCloud or the device when new contacts are created.  \nIf it's set to the device, new contacts won't sync to iCloud.  The process appears the same no matter how it is set.  So, it's easy to create a new contact, and it's natural to expect it will sync by default, but maybe it won't. \nTwo question.  1)  How do I identify the non-synching contacts on my device?  2)  Once I do, how do I set them as iCloud contacts, so they will sync?  Or do I have to re-input them? \n\nA: There are apps which let you manage the contacts (on device, icloud, etc) directly on the phone.  I've used the one linked below to do just that.  (Create a contact, and remember to copy it to the other side).  In the Contacts app, contacts which are in both the device (which is synced to the non-icloud computer) and icloud are shown as \"unified info\" when the data matches up, and at the bottom of the contact is a link to both cards.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smart-merge-duplicate-contacts/id519076307?mt=8 \n\nA: One thing to know, even though this doesn't answer your entire questions, is that the contacts that exist only Only Your Mac, in Contacts on the Mac, can simply be dragged and dropped onto All iCloud, under the iCloud list, or onto whatever group you like. And if it's a duplicate, Contacts will ask you if you really want to import it. \nWhy there are these two different sections in Contacts, I'm not sure anyone but Apple-in-their-wisdom knows. \nBut conversely, dragging individuals or Groups to On My Mac provides a handy local copy of your contacts, should something go amiss with iCloud, hard as that is to imagine.\n", "Q: Scheduling cronjobs at specified time I have scheduled some jobs in crontab which are to be run one by one, at some specific time.

The first time I checked out the cycle count was today and it's currently on 1004. Now my question is, is this the cycle count of the battery since I replaced it (as in, it reads the cycle count from the battery), or is it the combined cycle count (as in, it stores the count somewhere and increments occasionally)? My assumption is that it's the count of that battery but I have no idea how to verify this.\nEither way, it looks like I need a new battery ;) \n\nA: The cycle count is logged on the battery itself.\nI've never actually dug into the idea to see the method or technology used to store the cycle count, however I do know this to be true thanks to personally refurbishing hundreds of MacBooks.  When checking over a MacBook's battery life in System Information / System Profiler I would often switch out batteries and check again, deciding if a battery replacement was worthwhile.  Once the battery is switched out you will see the cycle count (along with capacity, etc) change.  If you don't see it change then you either need to refresh System Profiler (command + R) or the second battery just happens to have the same info.\nIf you're curious you could always visit the Genius Bar at an Apple store and have them pop in one of their spare batteries that they use for testing.\n", "Q: My iPhone won't shut down what can I do to access idle mode of my iPhone 4s or shut down the phone?

But now after the upgrade, when I press F6 (or Fn+F6 for that matter) I am switched to a different desktop!  If I press it again, all the windows on that desktop disappear.  A third press causes the windows to reappear, and after that it just seems to toggle visibility of windows on my alternate desktop.\nI have looked at Keyboard Shortcuts in System Preferences, but nothing appears to use the F6 key, and I haven't found anything in Apple's documentation which talks about what the actual function keys are supposed to do - only what the Icons do which is different, such as adjusting volume or screen brightness.  That is not what I am interested in, as I am using the Fn+ equivalent.\nI am using an iMac with a fairly recent Bluetooth keyboard, and there is no \"Num Lock\" equivalent for F6 as apparently some keyboards have.\n\nA: If you upgrade to Mac OS X 10.8.4 Mountain Lion and also have Parallels Desktop installed, you will be required to upgrade the latter to version 8.

I pulled out the new drive, put it in the enclosure and booted from it. The computer ran fine this way and I used it all day via USB with no problems. This lead me to believe the internal SATA cable was faulty as the drive worked fine externally but not internally. \nI replaced the SATA cable today and thought the problem was fixed. The computer booted fine and ran for an hour. I used disk utility to verify the drive and repair permissions, but then the computer froze again. I restarted and it ran fine for a few minutes than froze. After each restart the computer will run for a while and then freeze. Any ideas why the drive boots and works fine externally but not internally? The old drive works perfectly fine internally as well. I don't see a problem with the new drive since it works great externally when I boot from it.\n\nA: Try resetting both the NV-RAM (P-RAM) but more importantly, the SMC Power Manager for your model, which can be looked up on Apple Support to be certain. It's usually: remove battery, unplug, hold down Power key for 10 seconds. \nAlso try a Safe Boot. And repairing the hard disk from an external startup, so that Disk Utilities can fully repair. But the problem you describe usually indicates some kind of electrical glitch, which needs to be solved. \n\nA: Same issue here with seagate momentus 5400 - beachball for exactly 20 seconds every time. Disk activity drops to zero and no entries in console right away ( after some time there are kernel[0]: disk0s2: I/O errors )\nIt have been serviced - DISK and SATA cable is new ( POWER ON : 549 hrs ) - diagnostic tools shows that everything is allright and SMART utility status: PASSED ( but UDMA CRC Errors are rising - now at 42900 raw value ).\nSystem runs ok on USB drive - but my ST9750423AS still freezes when installed internally.\nFrom these two data points, it seems you can't just put any drive inside the 2009 era Macs and expect them to work with the firmware that's on these newer drives.\n\nA: I owned a Mid-2009 2.53 15\" MacBook Pro and upgraded to a Western Digital Scorpio Black 7200 RPM drive. What I discovered was that an EFI/Firmware update (which I had installed prior) that supposedly allowed SATA III drives to work properly was causing issues. I got beach balling and crashing and could not install OS X from scratch onto the drive. WD shipped me a replacement drive, I took the laptop to the Apple Store, nobody could figure it out. But when I downgraded to the previous firmware, the problems went away (although the drive ran theoretically at a lower speed on the SATA bus, it was still an improvement over the stock drive).\nI no longer have that firmware downgrade utility, because I've moved on from that machine. You can find information on downgrading here, though: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4847773?start=0&tstart=0\nWarning: attempting to downgrade EFI is not supported by Apple, and theoretically installing Firmware obtained from a 3rd party source can be a security risk. Use at your own peril.\n", "Q: Sublime Text like fuzzy filesystem search for Mac OS X Currently I am using Alfred's filesystem navigation capabilities. It's pretty awesome, but sometimes I want fuzzy-search to match not only the filename but the full path.\nE.g. I want to find a pdf file with some very common filename (say proposal.pdf). And I have a directory structure like this:\n - dropbox\n   - partners\n     - supercorp\n       - proposal.pdf\n     - megacorp\n       - proposal.pdf\n\nIt would be nice if I can type dro/meg/propos to get to the megacorp's proposal file. The answer may be the Alfred plugin or some configuration, but I'll accept any solution that allows me to quickly navigate to this file and perform some action (e.g. reveal in Finder or something). \"Search-as-you-type\" functionality is very important.\nUPD Just found a similar question. Seems that full path matching feature is missing because mdfind is only searching the file name and all the tools are using it internally.\n\nA: Alfred ships with an example workflow called Dynamic File Search that does something similar to fuzzy searching:\nhttps://www.alfredapp.com/blog/tips-and-tricks/how-to-get-the-results-you-want-in-alfred-every-time/\nhttps://www.alfredforum.com/topic/11981-searching-in-files-in-a-specific-location/?do=findComment&comment=62957\nAlfred searching through directories and filenames at the same time\n\nTo add it, click the [+] at the bottom of the Workflows preferences, and choose Examples > Dynamic File Search.\n\n*\n\n*Type \"ff\" in Alfred to first select a search scope\n\n*Then type the name of the file you're searching for within that folder\n\n\nMore documentation on Alfred's file filter feature can be found here https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/file-filter/\n\nA: There is a kMDItemPath attribute, but it can't be used in queries.

What does a family with multiple devices do for charging and storage of a growing number of devices.  We now have 4 laptops 5 iPads and 5 iPhones plus several other iPods. Are there any cabinets designed for the home that can charge and house this many?  I am tired of the cords and devices laying all over my house.\n\nA: I find the cables die pretty frequently. The kids always get them knotted, or stress them. So, I buy a lot of cheap ones. Something like these. At $4 for 5 I tend to buy 15-20 a time. Takes months to run through them and I don't fret about it.

For example, I have a device like this that suits all of my charging needs.\n", "Q: AppleRAID 0+1 failure: [corestorage] LVG missing and cannot repair mirror I just recently created a corestorage LVG and an encrypted volume that used an AppleRAID 0+1 array, but something has gone horribly wrong.\nI had four 1TB disks, and created two 2TB stripes, cbs1 and cbs2, and mirrored them in Disk Utility. Then I created a [corestorage] LVG and fed it the UUID of the mirrored device, and created an encrypted jHFS+ filesystem at 100% of the capacity of the 2TB mirror.\nThis worked great, and behaved nicely for over a week. Today I had a software update that resulted in a reboot, and my RAID didn't show up. The LVG I created using the AppleRAID is no longer showing up in diskutil cs list and the mirror was set to auto repair and was making progress (it looked like cbs1 vanished but it was still there, so I thought it was an intermittent hardware issue on boot) and I let it make progress on the rebuild until it was complete, but it didn't end up the way I thought it would.\nI now saw in diskutil ar list that I had a missing or damaged mirror device, and so in an effort to be smart, I created another stripe of two other 1TB disks, called it cbs3 and attempted to add that as a spare or a member to the UUID of the mirror. HOWEVER, this fails with an error of -69848: Couldn't modify RAID set in both cases.\ndiskutil ar list now gives me the following:\nAppleRAID sets (4 found)\n===============================================================================\nName:                 cbs1\nUnique ID:            1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD\nType:                 Stripe\nStatus:               Online\nSize:                 2.0 TB (1999721791488 Bytes)\nRebuild:              manual\nDevice Node:          -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0  disk6s2   AA501823-4955-473B-A27E-0EEA9E75072A  Online     999860895744\n1  disk7s2   A6486548-3E07-4C0F-8F88-BE909D23DC22  Online     999860895744\n===============================================================================\n===============================================================================\nName:                 Untitled\nUnique ID:            1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD\nType:                 Mirror\nStatus:               Online\nSize:                 2.0 TB (1999721758720 Bytes)\nRebuild:              automatic\nDevice Node:          -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-  -none-    1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD  Missing/Damaged\n1  -none-    2B52C67D-801E-4481-A76B-F98FF28C13B5  Online     1999721758720\n===============================================================================\n===============================================================================\nName:                 cbs2\nUnique ID:            2B52C67D-801E-4481-A76B-F98FF28C13B5\nType:                 Stripe\nStatus:               Online\nSize:                 2.0 TB (1999721791488 Bytes)\nRebuild:              manual\nDevice Node:          -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0  disk8s2   890A3BB9-94CB-4E02-8580-5F16D94890FF  Online     999860895744\n1  disk10s2  71C4DE7E-6EC2-4660-9CDA-0ED31574925D  Online     999860895744\n===============================================================================\n===============================================================================\nName:                 cbs3\nUnique ID:            A153709E-88C8-4281-8268-F68C26077E6A\nType:                 Stripe\nStatus:               Online\nSize:                 2.0 TB (1999721791488 Bytes)\nRebuild:              manual\nDevice Node:          disk14\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0  disk2s2   C1227A8B-8215-4E7E-99C8-C8491B7D994F  Online     999860895744\n1  disk4s2   A65356C3-270C-404B-82AC-9EAB042B9300  Online     999860895744\n===============================================================================\n\nThis is doubly confusing because there is no DevNode for the mirror'ed volume, probably due to it previously being fed to corestorage.

With the normal Microsoft encoding of Wingdings, the letters and punctuation map to the symbols. \nPresumably, you have MS Office for Mac installed, because that installs a version of the font which includes these symbols in the normal character slots.  That's why you get the funny symbols.\nBy default, Mac OS X ships with a version of the font that does NOT have those symbols assigned to letters and punctuation.  In that case, apps will display normal letters. \nThe best solution would be to stop the sender from setting weird wingdings font on :-), but that may not be possible.\nAnother option is to remove the Microsoft version of the font and leave the OS X version. But that would mean that if you try to use Wingdings characters by typing letters, it wouldn't work. You'd need to add them from the character panel.\n", "Q: Alternative Ways to Control The Volume Level Of My Mac In OS X? Generally to either increase or decrease the volume level of my Mac, I always go to the volume menu bar and adjust the slider accordingly.\nI was wondering:\nWhat other ways exist within OS X to adjust volume settings and perhaps give even finer adjustments to the volume level that is produced ?\n\nA: *\n\n*Use the volume keys on your keyboard (hold Shift + Option for finer control)\n\n*Go to the Sound pane of System Preferences\n\n\nA: You mentioned alternate ways to control the volume.

Does OS X have an inbuilt effective \"self cleaning\" feature/mechanism. If so does it need to be turned on by default, and how often does it take place, (or is this something that is determined by the user).\nIs it advisable to use apps such as CleanMyMac or CCleaner for example ? (or are they more harmful than good).\n\nA: Applications such as CleanMyMac or CCleaner are unnecessary for your Mac. They can clear certain caches or preferences that can interfere with the proper functionality of your other applications - they'll be recreated anyway the next time you use the software. Unless you're in dire need of extra space on your hard drive, I wouldn't suggest trying to erase caches using cleaner applications. If anything, invest in an external hard drive and move some of your larger files over.\n\nA: Mac OS X does not have a self-cleaning feature. Such a feature is not needed on Mac OS X.\nThere is no reason to use cleaning applications. Such applications can do damage or perform tasks that leave your Mac or applications in an unusable state.\nThere are caches and other files on your Mac. These files are managed by the associated applications or the operating system. You can remove these files, but if you continue to use the associated application, that application will need to recreate the cache next time it launches.\n\nA: Both Andrew and Graham answers are correct. One useful tip is to always uninstall apps using AppCleaner instead of only putting the application file in the trash. This app will make sure to also erase all the caches and preference files of the app you're uninstalling.\n", "Q: How to clean install and only re-install old applications/files as you need them? I have Gooogled this for a couple of months now casually but have never gotten a guide that seems suited to me.\nI am running Snow Leopard. It's really starting to get slow. Basically, most guides on the net either tell you how to do a clean install and keep all of your files, or none of them. \nWhat I am looking for is something in between.\nI want to be able to have a completely fresh install, but then grab back stuff from my old backup as I need it. MS Office, maybe the occasional word file after that. Eclipse IDE, with all my original preference settings. Only as I need it. That way I can make more of less.\nDoes anyone know a guide online that resolves my problem? Or does anyone know how to do this themselves?\nAt this time, I am not interested in upgrading to Mountain Lion\n\nA: I'm not sure that you have an issue.

Is that comfortable or I should buy another one? I'm planning to buy an iMac next month. I'm a software developer. I usually use the Microsoft Keyboard for my programming tasks, It has a great ergonomics. I tried iMac's keyboard in the store but didn't get a chance to sit down and use it for an hour or so to understand if that works for me. Anyone is using it for heavy programming and can tell me if that is comfortable for hours of coding ?\nThanks :)\n\nA: I personally use it everyday for my programming job. The thing I like the most about it is that the keys are low profile, so it's easy to glide your fingers across. That said, I have used a mac keyboard for the last 5 years, so I got used to it. You can only try to see if it fits you.\n\nA: I use the built in keyboard in my MBP which is comparable to the usb keyboard that comes with iMacs. I love it, and I agree that now any \"regular\" keyboards feel large and typewriter-y. (For lack of a better word). I do code on a daily basis and I find this keyboard the most comfortable one I have used.\nHope This Helps.\n", "Q: How can you get OSX if your hard drive crashed and you don't have the original DVD anymore? Yesterday my HD died. I thought about buying a new disk and reinstalling, but I can't find the original DVD that came with the machine (it's a MacBook 5.1, it came with 10.5). Suppose I want to buy and install a new operating system, how can I do it, considering that boxed dvds are no longer sold?  \n\nA: In the past AppleCare has been able to send replacement system discs.  I would assume the same holds true today but my only doubt stems from the age of the Mac, since it may be unsupported by AppleCare.  It's definitely worth a call though...\n\n\n*\n\n*Call 1-800-APLCARE (Or find your Apple support number HERE if you're outside of the US/Canada)\n\n*Give them your serial number (found on your Mac, underneath your battery)\n\n*Explain that you have misplaced the gray system discs that came with your Mac and that you need replacement discs in order to reinstall your operating system.\n\n\nHopefully they are still able to provide replacements!\n\nA: OS X 10.6 DVDs are still available from Apple for $19.99: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC573/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard\n", "Q: Can I use my iPhone internationally? I have an Apple iPhone 4 (model A1349) with Virgin Mobile service.  It works fine in the US but Virgin told me that it won't work internationally (i.e., calling within other countries or calling US from abroad).  \nIs there anything that I can do with this phone or do I need a new phone and/or carrier?\n\nA: The iPhone 4 came in two flavors: CDMA (Verizon, Virgin, etc.) and GSM (AT&T, T-Mobile, etc.).\nThe GSM phone will work, however it will incur international roaming charges. Your CDMA version on the other hand will not work in most countries outside of the US.\nI would recommend upgrading to the 4S or 5 as changing carriers will not change the radio in your phone.\n\nA: If you purchased your iPhone 4 from Virgin, you can ask them to unlock your phone.  If you got your iPhone 4 from elsewhere, it's probably already unlocked.\nOnce your phone is unlocked, you can put another SIM card into it.  When I travel overseas, I usually get a SIM card for the country that I'm in, and share my new phone number with whoever is going to need to reach me.  When you do this, you'll need to comparison shop to determine which local carrier will best meet your needs.  Some costs to consider include:\n\n\n*\n\n*local calls\n\n*calls back to the US\n\n*data\n\n*local texts\n\n*texts to the US\n\n\nThe disadvantage of this plan is that calls to your US phone number won't connect to you.  You could get a Google Voice number and temporarily forward your calls to that number, which will allow you to get voicemail online.  \nIf it's really important to you that people be able to reach you directly on US phone number while you're overseas, then you should talk with other carriers and determine what their rates are for overseas usage.  Don't forget to check the rates for calling within the country(ies) that you're visiting, receiving incoming calls, sending/receiving texts, and data usage.  \nI've found that the rate for overseas usage is too high for my tastes, but your mileage may vary.  I always get a local SIM when I travel overseas.\n", "Q: cannot add shortcut to switch to desktop 2 when apps are fullscreen on 10.8.4 I am running 10.8.4 and would like to switch to different desktops using keyboard shortcuts. Unfortunately for me, I only see \"Switch to Desktop 1\" and have not way to add a shortcut to switch to desktop 2. \n\nIf I have have 4 desktops, I have to scroll through all 3 of them if I want to go from desktop 1 to 4.\nUPDATED QUESTION\nSorry - This question has become a little convoluted suddenly. I am able to desktops using CTRL + # shortcut only if the apps is not full screen. If I have full screen apps, I cannot use the short cut (perhaps because it is not longer a \"Desktop\" then). I use my editor, browser and terminal all the time in fullscreen mode - I just want to switch to them using one shortcut - I could do this in older version of osx, but not in 10.8.4 :(\n\nA: Full screen apps do not count as a desktop.\n\nSo if you set up looks something like the above, you can not switch to desktop 2 because there isn't one. What you have is one Desktop and two spaces.\nIf you want to be able to switch between full screen apps, without cycling through each space you could change your Mission Control settings.\n\nBy checking the highlighted box you can switch full screen app spaces by using the command+tab keyboard shortcut.\nAlso, in order to create a shortcut for Desktop 2 you need to have at least two desktops running open before you open System Preferences.\n\nA: you need to activate all the desktop you want to use first. I had to open 6 windows and drag each to each new desktop then open up the preference again and you'd find the 'switch to desktop 2,3,5...' start to appear in shortcut preference setting. \nThis is very stupid by Apple.\n\nA: \"move right a space\" is what your looking for\n\nA: Using Control + Right arrow is very inconvenient (i.e. unergonomic) for two reasons: \n\n\n*\n\n*You need to press it as many times as spaces you want to cycle\n\n*You need two hands (left hand to press Ctrl + right hand to press the arrows), whereas if you press Ctrl+N you only need your left hand. \n\n\nI agree with the principle of simplicity but only as long as it's not in contradiction with flexibility. Macs should not be designed only for dumb people but also for advanced users who know what they're doing. \n\nA: Control + Right Arrow helps switch between the desktops.\nI think it is not necessarily to make a shortcut for \"Switch to Desktop 2\".\n", "Q: USB Mouse Jerky Tracking - Software Issue? I have two Logitech MX510 mice, and two macs - an iMac and MBP. Recently, the former has started responding to mouse input jerkily and without any precision - to the point that it is almost unusable. Switching out the mouse, rebooting, etc make no difference. \nSimilarly, both mice function fine over a long period of time attached to the MBP. The only change I have made to the iMac (2012 gen, OSX10.8) is to install Crashplan - but I did this on the other computer too and that made no difference.\nIs there anything I can do to flush out the settings for the mouse, and so return it to usability? The problem does not occur with the wireless magic mouse, or the wireless trackpad.\nThanks!§\n\nA: Could you have different mouse drivers on the iMac than the MBP?\nTry to install the drivers from Logitech, or remove them completely, see if that makes a difference.

I am confused how to setup proxy for iTunes and App Store on Macbook Air.\nI have noticed that Safari can connect to the Internet through proxy, but for iTunes and App Store, I do not know how it works. \nCan you help me with this? Thanks.\n\nA: The Change Settings… button in Safari > Preferences… > Advanced opens the global Proxies sheet. Changes made here affect every app that uses that connection.\n\n\nAlternatively the sheet can be opened by opening System Preferences.app, selecting Network, then Advanced…, then Proxies.\n\nA: I am going to recommend two methods to get things working when under any proxy. I am using Mavericks, but I think these methods should work for any other version of OS X too. Go to second method if you don't want to read through the whole answer.\n1. Using Advanced Proxy Settings using Locations in Network Preferences.\nI personally shift between various networks regularly. Some of these require a proxy, and others don't, and I find the Locations feature very helpful. I created a \"College\" location specifically for those networks which require a proxy, in which all networks need a proxy authentication.\nAll these settings can be accessed from System Preferences -> Network.\n\nYou can create a new location as per your needs as shown in the above picture.\n\nOnce you're done with the location, connect to your favorite network and click on the Advanced settings.\n\nGo to proxy tab, and set your proxy settings as shown in the image. Notice the *college-domain-here.com in the \"Bypass proxy\" section below: you can specify those domains here, for which you don't need a proxy server to access. Remember to set HTTP, HTTPS, and whatever other proxies you need - all of them. Forgetting any one of those will cause weird problems like websites loading indefinitely and so on.\nI have found this method to be very helpful in most occasions, but I've had my share of troubles with this method. For example, App Store and iTunes Store didn't work most of the time, and a really irritating dialogue box popped up randomly asking for my password, which never seemed to work.\nSo, here is a better method:\n2. Using Authoxy\nAuthoxy is a small software which runs a proxy server in your local machine (laptop) and tunnels all your connections in a beautiful manner via the proxy you specify.\n\nHere is a step-by-step procedure to get it installed and working: http://davidtse916.wordpress.com/2008/03/14/a-step-by-step-guide-to-authoxy/\nThe good thing is: AppStore and iTunes always work with this method.\n\nA: I find setting up SORKS proxy is a solution with ssh tunnel.\nI refer to this document for help.\n", "Q: Show folder a file is contained in with finder list view in OSX 10.8.4 I am trying to consolidate files that may be spread around my mac (photos in this case).  I can tell the finder to search for images, but I am very used to in Windows where I can search for the file type across the computer, and then show a column in the details view that shows the path where the file is located.  So far, I cannot find such a thing in the list or coverflow view in the finder.\nI know i can see it in the properties of the files, but it would be very helpful to see it at a glance for multiple files, instead of individually.  But since I can't sort by their folder location, I can't even assume that the file after it in the list is in the same folder, so I can't even infer where they are based on pictures around it.\nIs there a way to show the path where a file is in a finder search?  Or lest that, perhaps something that could print out where the files are into a text document to help the search?\n\nA: Download Alfred 2. It is an excellent application that allows for a streamlined search of your computer's files, and it also allows has other uses such as opening other applications or webpages. It shows you the location of the file that you're accessing, so for example if you type \"chrome\" it will show the option of opening Chrome in its application location.\nA useful shortcut is \"apple click\" which then opens up the location of the file.\n", "Q: Taking a Mac Mini and associated Peripherals As Carry-On Luggage Aboard An Aircraft? Is there any reason(s) when luggage is screened at airport security, not to be able to take a Mac Mini, keyboard and mouse as carry-on luggage aboard an aircraft ?\n\nA: No reason at all. You do not have to take any of those items out of a bag going through x-ray like you do a laptop (go figure) and TSA is familiar with them. You might consider taking the Mac mini out or packing it in such a way that it will show up easily on x-ray.\nI'd say you're good to go.\nI travel often with an iPad, iPhone, MacBook Pro and all associated power supplies and chargers as well as a small external hard disk. I take the MacBook Pro out and put it in a bin but the rest of it stays in my pack. Occasionally a TSA agent will want to look in the pack but that's rare and usually because the stuff was so densely packed they couldn't visually sort it out on their monitor.\nWhile I don't have personal experience with a Mac mini, my guess is you'll be just fine. When in doubt, making it easier for TSA to see it by taking it out and putting it in a tray. If you have a small padded case it can travel in, you can leave it in that but take it out of your larger pack or suitcase so they can scan it separately but I'm betting that won't be necessary.\nAll of that said, every airport/TSA station is different and some are tougher than others. I travel out of Hartford, JFK and LAX and they can all be tough but I've never had an issue.\n", "Q: Unable to read last block of the device I'm mid way through replacing the hard drive in my MacBook Pro (mid-2009). I've created a boot disk (10.8) on a SD card which I am booting from.\nOn trying to format the new drive with disk utility (in from the installer) I am being presented with the following error.\nDisk Erase Failed\nDisk Erase failed with the error:\nUnable to write to the last block of the device\n\nGoogling suggests this error message is somewhat ambiguous. The drive is brand new and from disk utility the SMART status is \"verified\".\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: The solution was really rather simple. A dead HD cable causing the HD to show up (and verify) but not function.\n\nA: 'unable to read last block of device' is a generic error.\nfor me i ran into this similar error, but specifically:\nError: -69760: Unable to write to the last block of the device.\nIf you get this specific error it seems to be due to the block size that the drive was formatted in. Macs do not seem to play well with discs formatted with higher block sizes.\nThe default file size when i formatted an SSD as exFat32 using my windows surface was 4096kb and this would not play nice with my mac, causing this blocksize error when attempting a format.\nThis answer suggests 128kb unit allocation size format (i assume they mean cluster size). The minimum block size i could format with using my windows surface device was 1024kb and this worked for me allowing me to then use as exFat32 with the Mac.\nHowever with the particular SSD device i bought, it only allowed me to do a quick (not full) format (on windows), and mac would still not allow me to then reformat as APFS, but at least i had a working storage device that my mac allowed me to read and write to. This was a cheap SSD so its possible it had been preformatted badly causing these limitations. The cable i was using to connect the SSD was new and decent so i dont see that as what was preventing a full erase/format.\nThe only problem is that i cannot store files larger than 4GB as i couldnt reformat as APFS, but i think this is probably a limitation of the cheaper device.\n", "Q: How to Screen Capture while in Cmd+Tab I ran into a rare situation - I want to snag a picture of my screen while using cmd+tab to show people how I navigate around in this how-to post. \nThe regular cmd+shift+3 or 4 didn't do anything.

My 2007 MacBook (10.6.8) worked perfectly fine with my AirPort Express, until I added a 2010 iMac (10.8.4) to the network.\nWhen I first setup the iMac it connected to the AirPort Express, but not to the internet. The AirPort menubar icon showed an exclamation mark on it. At some point in or after the setup I was prompted to set up my AirPort Express, which had already been configured and working just fine with my MacBook.\nI followed the instructions and the AirPort Express restarted. It worked! My iMac was/is now online. However, when I went back to the MacBook it was now showing the same exclamation mark on the AirPort menubar icon that the iMac had initially showed.\nI have tried restarting the MacBook, the AirPort Express, and the iMac. I've disabled and enabled the AirPort on the MacBook. After each attempt the MacBook connects to the network and a few seconds later shows the exclamation mark when it fails to receive an IP address.\nWanting to dig into the router settings I opened up AirPort Utility on the iMac but got an error message: \"This version of AirPort Utility doesn't support this base station.\"\nIs the problem a compatibility issue between 10.6.8 and 10.8.4? Or 10.8.4 and the older AirPort Express? I'm confused by this since the MacBook did work perfectly fine before, when the iMac did not, and now that the iMac does, the MacBook does not.\nDoes anyone know what is going on!?\n\nA: Setting the AirPort Express b/g to g-only mode solved this problem for me, though I don't understand why.\n", "Q: How to force iMovie to create iPhoto video thumbnails in the background? I import my videos from my camera into iPhoto along with the stills. Then I use iMovie to create videos from them. Unfortunately every time I open iMovie to get some work done it wants to go through and update thumbnails. Sometimes it is quick, but sometimes it takes quite a while.\nIs there a way to get iMovie to make these thumbnails in the background so I am not forced to wait when I open it? I know I can skip it, but usually those thumbnails are for the video I want to work on.\n\nA: Try importing a movie from a DVD.\nIf you do, that will give your video options just enough complexity, apparently, to cause imovie to give you a choice;  the left navigation should show that importation event along side of your iphoto movies. This happened to me at least. As soon as I imported from other sources, it no longer kept my ENTIRE iphoto library as the default. In reading what I just wrote, I'm now confused: I'm pretty sure that I put my DVD video through iPhoto first, so, I'm not sure exactly what I did in imovie to make the importation event unique, but in any case, once I did that, I wound up seeing a directory structure where my iphotos videos were no longer the default selected.\nOf course, in order to use any of those videos, I now have to click on iPhoto movies in which case I'm back to waiting for the all to load, which still takes a long time.\n", "Q: System Images with different Model Identifiers I have been tasked with creating a default system image to use to both back up and use to deploy to new systems. \nAfter checking the stats on the 7 systems in question I've found that there are multiple model identifiers.\nWould I be correct in my assumption that a system image made for one model identifier would not be useful for a system with a different identifier?\n\nA: No, one image should work for all models of Mac that are compatible with that particular version of Mac OS X. A single image can be used across all kinds of Macs: MacBooks, iMacs, Mac minis, Mac Pros.\nSo check each of your 7 Macs and identify the most recent version of Mac OS X that each Mac can run.\n", "Q: Why does my computer seem to have a disagreement on hostnames between .home versus .local? At home, my laptop's sharing control panel tells me that it will be accessible as 'whatever.local', but the 'hostname' command reports 'whatever.home'. What's this about?\n\nA: .home is a Pseudo-top-level domain. You probably have a DHCP server in your network, maybe in your router, that enables the .home TLD on your network and tells its clients about it (you may see home in the domains entry in the Network Control Panel), and that – your laptop's \"static\" DNS name – is what is reported by hostname.\n.local is a reserved pseudo-TLD that is intended to be used with zeroconf and mDNS,\nand the Sharing Control Panel tells you your laptop's mDNS name.\nSince these two ways of name resolution are supposed to be orthogonal, there is nothing to worry about, your laptop just has two different names on your network.\nOn the contrary it can be quite useful, for example if you have a network application that only knows one way of name resolution (e.g. I have a NAS that doesn't resolve .local names), there is a way around it if you give the application the name with the right TLD.\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone disconnect from wireless when it is in use? Whenever I watch videos through the YouTube app on my iPhone 4 (iOS 6.1.3), after being on wireless for a while it will often spontaneously disconnect and start downloading from the 3G network. I only have a 200 MB data plan so this is a major problem. I'm guessing it is not app-specific, I just only happen to notice it with YouTube. I have 3/3 bars of wireless signal and my laptop in the same location has no problem so I don't think it's an issue with the wireless. I've tried restoring various levels of default settings and the entire phone to no avail.\n\nA: I wish I could comment, but do not have enough reputation.  Since it sounds like this problem is isolated solely to your specific iPhone, it sounds like it could be a problem with your router, or maybe the antenna in the phone itself is some how damaged.  I know you said you don't think it could be a problem with your wireless router, but do you experience any of the same problems when using any other devices?  My recommendation would be to reset your router to factory settings and then using your iPhone to view or download a large file over that connection.\nI really do think it is a problem with your router, as I have seen other wireless connections exhibit the same problems when they are about to fail.\n\nA: Check https://alvinalexander.com/apple/iphone-ios-using-cellular-data-home-wifi-network/:\nTry disable IPhone using Cellular Data when there is WiFi\n\nThen you can check how good your router actually is and fix if needed.\nWhen there is using 2 connections, it maybe temp delay that would make the switch, but only to make things worse.\n\nSimilar if you have 2 SIM cards (or SIM + eSIM), you may want to be sure witch one is in use:\nIn (at least iPhone 12+) Settings - Cellular - Cellular Data\nthere is switch \"Allow Cellular Data Switching\"\nwith description \"Turhing this feature on will allow your phone to use cellular data from both lines ...\"\n", "Q: Local (downloaded) music on iPhone On iTunes I set up a smart playlist to contain only downloaded music (iTunes Match) so that I can use it offline or when the connection has a very low quality (see for example Create a Smart Playlist for iCloud Songs that have been downloaded Locally)\nI would like to achieve something similar on my iPhone.\nI know that I can create a smart list on iTunes but the logic will refer to iTunes and not the iPhone. For example my \"downloaded music\" list is also present on iPhone but the songs are the one downloaded in iTunes not iPhone.\nDid I miss something? Is there a way to create a similar list or to listen to local music only?\n\nA: Did you turn off iTunes match on your iphone?Maybe you should try to turn that off and you might need to also toggle the music player setting to local files only: go to Settings > Music and set the option for \"Show all music\" to OFF. \n\nA: You are right, that a smart playlist will only sync the contents of the list to your phone, but not the logic of the smart list. So you probably cannot achieve your goal using a smart playlist. You correctly state that the smart playlist is evaluated on iTunes and not on the phone. This has has always been the behaviour of syncing any iPod/iPhone device with iTunes. \nWhat you could do is to create a list with the music you would like to have  with you at all time and hit the download all button for this playlist on the phone when you have a good connection, e.g. wifi.\nThis probably not what you really want, but it's probably the next best thing.\n", "Q: Some files in Time Machine are being locked I run Mountain Lion 10.8.4 on a Mac Mini 2012. Over the past year or so (dating back to my older iMac mid-2010, after which I transferred the data to my current Mac Mini), I've noticed that most of my files in Time Machine are getting locked. The files on my Mac are not locked, but the backed-up versions of the files are locked. The icons have a padlock icon on them. This is NOT due to the \"auto-lock documents\" feature, since this no longer exists in Mountain Lion.\nFor instance, my Firefox profile is a good example. Here are two screenshots:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screenshot of my Firefox profile. Everything looks fine.\n\n*The same profile, except the latest Time Machine backup.\nThese locks appear in every single backup I have, up until the oldest one. I ran \"Repair disk\" on Time Machine, which took about 30 minutes, and then made another backup, and this time the newest backup did not have any locks—but all the older backups still had locks. I found this a bit strange, because why would a backup I made AFTER running \"Repair disk\" be fixed, but the older ones remained unaffected?\nAnyway, I hoped that this would fix the problem, but every time I do this, a few weeks later, the problem re-occurs.\nSo, is there anything more permanent that I can do?\n\nA: I just tried \"Reset Home Folder Permissions and ACLs\" and it looks like it might be helping. I ran this for about 30 minutes, canceled it because it took too long, backed up Time Machine again, and noticed that Time Machine backed up some files that I did not touch. Turns out that these files were the same ones being locked in backups, and in the latest backup, they were no longer locked.\nSo perhaps I was having permission problems with the files that were getting locked? I don't know if this \"fix\" will resolve this permanently, or just for now, but it certaily seems to be related.\n", "Q: Can an iPad be charged faster with a third party power adapter? I recently came into possession of a Samsung usb charger. This charger has double the power output of the standard apple one (5Vx2A instead of 1A). Of course, it would be nice to decrease the charging time of my iPad (3rd gen) with this adapter. Since I don't have the equipment to measure the power consumption of an iPad during charging I can't produce reliable data on this issue.\nI was wondering if somebody ever studied the charging times of mobile apple devices (most notably the iPad) with third-party chargers and could share some  data (like power consumption, charging times, ...) on it.\n\nA: The standard iPad charger is 2.1Amp at 5V. The 1amp is for iPhone and charges slowly, or not at all if you're using it at the same time.\nThe 2Amp one will charge it much faster. Works very well with iPhones too.\nhttp://gizmodo.com/5535631/the-fastest-and-slowest-way-to-charge-an-ipad\n\nA: You can drain your device and time the charge rate with the device powered off or in airplane mode with a wrist watch. \nTh consumption can be controlled by powering off the device as soon as you see it running and charging. Placing it in airplane mode and powering it off also ensures that no significant CPU or network activity can drain power over the normal idle sleep power consumption. \nIn a test with putting the device in airplane mode and powering it off, you can en charge it to full and expect between 25 and 45 days of idle power in a fully charged battery with no additional charging. This low level of consumption might change your full charge time by tens of seconds at Mose over a totally idle and shut off device. \n", "Q: Mail freezes when saving message as draft Ever since upgrading to Mountain Lion, I noticed Mail often freezes up for a good 5-10 seconds at a time in the middle of typing. This happens constantly, and every time I notice it says \"Saving Message\". Unfortunately, it chooses to do this every time I start typing, and I often stop typing when I don't see the text appearing, so it takes me forever to compose a message of decent length. How do I fix this?\n\nA: Apparently this has to do with the draft email being saved to server. As a workaround, try disabling \"Store draft messages on the server\" in Mail.app Accounts settings.\n", "Q: iMac 2011 and WiFi 5GHz problem I have a problem with a Wi-Fi 5GHz connection on my iMac.\nI configured the 5 GHz network in the network settings, but iMac doesn't discover it. Usually it is connected to the 2.4 GHz network, and drop-down menu of Wi-Fi networks doesn't show 5 GHz mode. Sometimes, when booting, iMac sees and can connect to the 5 GHz network.\nAs a result of analysis of the problem, I realized that it depends on the region in the Airport utility. In the utility I selected US as a country. A Wi-Fi adapter determines himself is in Russian. 5 GHz radio is not for Russia (802.11d), so the adapter just does not see the existing network in most cases. Sometimes, at the next boot, the adapter does not set RU, and thus sees and connects to the 5 GHz network.\nTell me, please, how you solve a similar problem.\nPS: The problem is well known and is described in Internet. iMac is only problem, a MacBook and an iPhone connected to 5GHz without problems. Thank you.\n\nA: Recently I did some sleuthing and found my 2.4 GHz network was actually faster than the 5GB in certain parts of my house ... on MacBookPro mid-2010 and iPad 2 wi-fi. Airport Extreme Base Station.  \nSo possibly, depenoing on placement of your machine, it's not a big problem?\n", "Q: Over 25 gb of Space Disappeared Here's my problem: over the past couple days I did a really good clean out of my computer and managed to free up several gigabytes of data and was hovering around 233+ gb of free space. \nThen in the last couple of days I noticed my trash file was taking a really long time to empty (I don't know if this is part of the problem but wanted to mention it just in case).\nLast night I noticed I was missing quite a lot of space on my drive, it was around 205 gigs now. I discovered I had accidentally set some large torrent files to be on my main drive instead of an external. No matter, I figured! I would just delete them and start them over on the external. But my disk space didn't seem to change. So I rebooted - after all I had recently used Photoshop and that tends to hog a bunch of space and I don't get it back until I reboot.\nI rebooted and there was still the same ~205 gb of free space. I was very confused. I was even more confused when I checked \"About My Mac\" and saw that it was telling me that in actual fact I only had around 90gbs of free space. THE HECK!?\nI did notice that my \"backups\" were surprisingly high - 119gb in fact. This was especially curious since I have a time machine drive (time capsule) thats supposed to be backing up hourly. I did get a message this morning telling me it was full, but isn't it supposed to clear itself out?\nRunning WhatSize (it's still running by the way) I see that my .MobileBackups folder is a gargantuan 134gb! I thought these were temporary! For when I'm not connected to Time Machine (WHICH I AM!)\nWhat in the hell is going on? How did I magically lose close to 25 gigs? And how the hell do I get it back?\n\nA: The current version of Time Machine keeps two types of backups.  There are backups that are stored on your computer as well as network backups that are stored on your networked storage (time-capsule, NAS, etc).  You can see these by entering Time Machine and looking at the timeline ticks to the right.  The pink/purple ticks are network copies and the white ticks are the ones on your local computer.  The local backups occur when your network storage is not available, also they may occur more often than the 1hr snapshots set for network backups.  As your hard drive fills up, OS X will start to cut back the amount of space it uses for local backups.  If you want to disable this feature and recover your local disk space, then open a terminal (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal) and enter the following command followed by your password.\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nThis should turn off the feature and free up the space.  You can turn it back on with\nsudo tmutil enablelocal\n\n\nA: Perhaps you have local snapshots enabled.\nThe local backups will automatically be cleaned up if your drive needs the space. \n\nNote: You may notice a difference in available space statistics\n  between Disk Utility, Finder, and Get Info inspectors. Those\n  differences are expected and can be safely ignored. The Finder\n  displays the available space on the disk without accounting for the\n  local snapshots, because local snapshots will surrender their disk\n  space if needed.\n\n", "Q: How do you get notes to stay only on your iPhone and not sync to any other device on the Notes app? I logged out of the iCloud account on both my iPhone and my iPad so neither devices sync each others music or apps anymore, but whenever I make a note on my iPhone I always find it on my iPad and I do not want it there. Is there a way to make my notes stay only on my iPhone?\n\nA: Notes may sync via other email services, like gmail.\nYou need to check the settings of EACH of your email accounts, and, if necessary, disable syncing notes.\nIt is also possible that notes sync to your Mac when you connect your iPhone to iTunes (via the USB cable or wireless). To avoid this, you might want to check iTunes sync settings (not 100% sure about the latter is still valid, it was definitely present in older versions of iTunes).\n\nA: Simply go to Settings > Notes and make sure the default notes account is set to \"On My iPhone\" instead of \"iCloud\". \nNow, newly created notes on your iPhone will remain on your iPhone and will not get pushed to the iCloud and hence your iPad.\n\nA: Go to the iCloud settings on your iPhone [Settings/iCloud] and simply disable the Note's sync features.\n\nA: Go to Settings\n-Notes on iphone6 plus move lever on (to green color) \"On My iPhone\" Account\nNow you have option to put ur notes on icloud folder or On my iphone\n\nA: You could also try using one of the many note taking alternatives on the app store - the free Note app from Squarespace is my favourite.\n", "Q: How to get Apple TV to start an iPhoto slideshow in the middle? I have a photo album in iPhoto '11.  To stream it to my Apple TV (3rd gen), I open iTunes '11 and do File > Home Sharing > Choose Photos to Share with Apple TV.  I select my photo album from the list and click Sync.\nNow on Apple TV, I choose Computers > Robert's Library > Photos > My Photo Album.\nI see a screen of thumbnails, all photos in the album.  I go to the top of the screen, choose Slideshow > Start Slideshow, and the slideshow starts from the first photo.\nMy problem is, I was showing the slideshow to my family (216 photos), and half way through we got interrupted by dinner so I stopped the slideshow.  Later, we sat down again to watch the rest, but there doesn't appear to be a way to start the slideshow from where we left off.\nI tried navigating the thumbnails to the last photo we saw, and select it, but that only provides for viewing individual photos and I have to manually next-next-next through the photos to watch them.\nIs there any way to start the slideshow from a specific photo in the album?\nAny info or suggestions are appreciated.  Thanks!\n\nA: You can use third party apps now and those make it easier to create and show slideshows from the middle. One in particular that I like is Slidez but there are others such as Storehouse. Go to the App Store and do a search from your Apple TV. Good luck.\n\nA: Make a new album in iphoto with the remaining photos and start on appleTV that album\n", "Q: Search a folder that is excluded from Spotlight I have excluded a folder from Spotlight, because this folder has a lot of files so it often fills up the results, no matter what I'm searching for. \nHowever, sometimes I still want to search this folder. So, I tried opening the folder in Finder, then searching using the box in the top-right corner of the window, then selecting Search: \"Folder_name\" to limit the results to just that folder.\nThis method does not show any results, however. I assume it's because the folder is excluded from Spotlight search. So, is there any way that I can perform a manual search on the folder still, whenever necessary?\n\nA: If you're happy with the terminal you can use the find command.\nSomething like opening Terminal in Utilities.\ncd <folder name>\nfind . -name <whatever you're searching for>\n\nOnce found you can open it up with open\nSo, I can do something like:\nalex@smiley:~|⇒  cd Desktop\nalex@smiley:~/Desktop|⇒  find . -name Mac*\n./Mac Pro.spx\nalex@smiley:~/Desktop|⇒  open Mac\\ Pro.spx\n\nNotice that I used the * as a wildcard to match all files starting with Mac\n\nA: Using terminal, you could use locate:\nlocate MY_FILE\nNormally, the locate's database is update periodically (see man locate).\nBut you can run (if database is not up-to-date):\nsudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb\n\nA: Spotlight let’s you exclude results quite easily using regex like syntax and SQL like syntax. Why not craft a smarter search and let it index this folder?\nYou can drop a newer index file in it and remove that file when you wish to include results as well. Pretty low impact since you’re about to index that folder one way or another and Spotlight is very efficient in my experience. \n\n\n*\n\n*Preventing Spotlight from Indexing Files & Folders?\n", "Q: How to get a higher res image in the Login page? For years, I've been using the 'Calico Cat' image that ships with OS X for my account.\nSince upgrading to Mountain Lion (maybe since Lion?) the Login page has larger round account images, and it shows the 'Calico Cat' image as a rather stretched and fuzzy rendering.\nIs there a way to fix this?  Did Apple simply not provide a higher res version of the default account images?  If not, this seems like an oversight, Apple used to be very conscious of such things, for example, I know that every application icon has an embedded hi-res version it's image.\nAny suggestions are welcome.  Thanks!\nRob\n\nA: Unfortunately, you're right. The icons are just low-res, not up to snuff for how they are being rendered now. You can find them, and others, in this folder: /Library/User Pictures/Animals. Funny thing is, some of the icons, like the Zebra or Penguin, are much higher res. It seems Apple just added new, better icons without updating all of the old ones. However, if you were to replace the cat icon with another, higher-res icon of the exact same name, I'm sure it would replace it just fine.\n", "Q: Removing .ds_store from desktop while still having view hidden files on? I have a .DS_Store on my desktop. Ruins the flow. I want to remove it and have it hidden, but I have hidden files enabled on my mac as I need it. This file however, is annoying.\n\nA: There is a thorough discussion on this Superuser question.  \nHaving a transparent icon that is off the desktop (Kevin Suttle), or a read-only desktop (joshfindit) seem to be the best feasible solutions.\n\nA: You can toggle the visibility of hidden files using a keyboard shortcut from a Finder plugin called TotalFinder.

I haven't made any backup and contents of those notes are very important to me.\nHow can I restore or at least access some of my lost notes?\n(My iPhone 4s isn't jail broken and I don't install any games or any apps on it)\n\nA: If you backup with iTunes and you restored from the backup and the notes were gone, then there is no where to retrieve them from unless you have another backup that contains those notes.\nLaunch iTunes on the computer and go to iTunes>Preferences>Devices. You will see a window with all of your backups listed in it.\nIf you see a recent backup that you are certain contains the notes that you need, recover deleted notes from iPhone backup.\nIf your note is gone from iCloud.com there is only a few ways to possibly recover it.\nThe first things I would check is a iCloud Backup, a iTunes Backup, or a 3rd party email that may have contained the note. To restore from a iCloud or iTunes backup follow this link. This article explains how to restore a device from either back up.\nNote if you have backed up since the note went missing, you will not have the note on the backup. Make sure you do not back up if trying to restore from a back up as this will back up the content without the note.\nTo get to the \"Set up assistant\" on an iOS device, you must go to Settings>General>Reset>Erase All Content and Settings. Once the phone restarts, you will be at the \"Set up Assistant\" \nGmail emails are very commmon sources for notes and you may have been adding them to the gmail notes without even knowing it.\n\nA: I just lost all notes. I tried the backups but as soon as restore was completed, it would lose notes again. I disconnected after recover but still no notes.\nOut of desperation, as I have all my passwords etc on it (yes, I know) but I trusted the iTunes backup system. I looked on the net and found a recovery company called Wondershare, Dr Phone. I tested it and there it all was, but it has now cost me £71 to purchase key number to download my info.\nAll notes info and everything else is available. It saves it in a file which you open.\nNow I have to type it all in again. I will keep manual backups now as well as using Dropbox from now on. Nightmare.\nI hope this helps you all.\n\nA: Solution 1 Recover deleted iPhone notes from Gmail\nGmail email is a very common storing place for notes, usually you may have added your notes to the Gmail account without even knowing it. Because the first time when you sync your notes to iCloud, you should set a mail account. If you have set a Gmail account, the synced notes are actually stored as email in the notes label of your Gmail, which provides a possibility to restore iPhone notes from Gmail. Then just go to your Gmail to find back your deleted iPhone notes.\nSolution 2 Recover deleted iPhone notes from iTunes Backup using iTunes\nIf you have synced or backed up your iPhone via iTunes, you can easily recover notes from iPhone by restoring iPhone from iTunes Backup. Because when you restore iPhone from iTunes backup, you restore the total iTunes backup data to your iPhone. Here are brief instructions for your reference.\nConnect your device to the computer and run iTunes. When the connected device has been recognized by iTunes, click your device on the “Devices” column of the left sidebar, then you can see the Summary tab on the right, select Backups > This computer > Restore Backup…\nThen choose a backup of your iPhone from the pop-up “Restore from Back up” window.\nPlease note that, to restore iPhone from iTunes backup in this way, not only your notes, but also all the other types of files in your previous backup will be restored, but they’ll overwrite and replace the current data on your iPhone.\nSolution 3 Recover deleted iPhone notes from iCloud Backup\nIn order to recover deleted iPhone notes from iCloud backup, firstly you should make sure you have an iCloud backup by tapping Settings > iCloud > Storage & backup > manage storage space, then you can see the iCloud backup list of all your iOS devices.\nAfter ensuring there’s an iCloud backup, you can refer to the short guide below about how to recover iPhone from iCloud backup.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iOS device, go to Settings > General > Software Update. You should update your device to the latest iOS, so you can restore from a recent backup of another device, such as a lost or broken device.\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Reset, then tap “Erase all content and settings”.\n\n*Then you’ll be led to the Setup Assistant, sign in to iCloud, tap “Restore from a Backup”, then choose from the list of your backups in iCloud.\nThen all the data on your iCloud backup will be restored to your iPhone, including the iPhone notes. In Step 2 above, you must have noted that you have to remove all contents and settings on your iPhone device so as to recover deleted iPhone notes from iCloud backup.\n\nA: If you connect your iPhone to a computer running Linux (Ubuntu version in my case) it will become recognized as a normal USB memory pen-drive.\nFrom there, you can use many methods to recover your lost deleted files.\nTestDrive allows you to search the drive (iPhone memo) and gives you the possibility to recover deleted files. I'm not an expert, nor did it with iDevice by myself. But it worked for me with Symbian phone (Nokia)... \nAlternatively:\nCheck steps explained in this article.\nAlso more detailed here.\n\nAs the reason of your files disappeared is kind a fuzzy, I just hope that your lost text documents will be recoverable this way...\n", "Q: How do I enable \"mouse trails\" in OSX?

The MacBook comes with a standard 4GB of RAM but there is an upgrade that cost $100, to double the RAM to for 8GB. \nSo my question is, is that extra RAM worth the cost, or is it uncessary? \n\nA: It's like upgrade your house to have another room. Wether or not it justify's its cost depends on wether you use it or not. In general, I'd say 4GB is the minimum to go by these days, I'd opt for 8GB for most non-casual users.\nConsidering how expensive a MacBook is, I'd suggest going the extra mile to ensure your purchase lasts you well into the future. If your model is not a retina model (I.e. the RAM is user serviceable), I'd strongly recommend a 2x8GB kit like this one. At $130, it's only $30 more expensive than the 8GB Apple offers, but is DOUBLE the memory. (it's faster too, but your MacBook will bottleneck the speed difference, so it won't actually count for anything)\n\nA: To add my own two cents- I agree that an upgrade is worthwhile, and I would (and did) do it.  However, don't stress about it too much, because assuming you didn't get a Retina model or an Air, you can upgrade the RAM at any time pretty easily.  I would also recommend purchasing it elsewhere (read: Amazon) however, because it's cheaper there.  Installing it yourself will also give you a little more confidence and ownership of your machine.  Putting some physical work into it can be a very satisfying feeling.  You may use it at first and never even think you need it, or maybe just stick to 8 GB, which you can find good deals on as well.\nOne very important detail that Alex did not mention is that a MacBook Pro will not downclock RAM, meaning that you will need to purchase the RAM that is the correct speed for your computer.  This isn't a problem on PCs, but for whatever reason Apple's computers do not compensate.  HOWEVER- the RAM he pointed you towards is the correct speed, and a good choice.  Just a kind of FYI for future reference.\nOther than that, I loved his answer.  Great analogy. \n\nA: If you are an normal user , 4 GB would be enough, If you are planning to use multiple OS or a serious Video editor working with multiple apps at same time , then go for the upgrade. Also upgrade to 16 GB ( 8GB + 8 GB) other than going for 8 GB (4 GB + 4 GB).\n", "Q: I stopped Time Machine and I lost my files I have a huge problem. It seems that I erased 1TB of my husband´s pictures (he is a photographer).\nHe has a 2TB Verbatim external disk and today I was kind of playing with Time Machine. I don´t really know how I clicked into \"selected the backup disk\" and I clicked the Verbatim one. The backup started saying \"preparing disk...\"but immediately I thought that something is going wrong so I switched off this external disk.\nNow the problem is that if I open the external disk, Finder says that \"can´t read this disk\". In finder it looks empty, except a new folder created by Time Machine called backup.backupbd or something like that.\nTime Machine didn´t ask me at any moment something like \"are you sure you want to format/erase the content?\". So I presume the files are still there!\nPlease help!!!\nThanks for your patience!\n\nA: Here is what might have happened:\nYou had a drive that was formatted as a PC drive and the Mac OS, thinking it was helpful, offered to back itself up to that drive. If someone clicked yes several times, that would prompt you to erase the drive (and since you didn't list the OS running on the Mac, the exact terms might be different if you have Lion versus Mountain Lion vs another OS version).\nAt that point, the drive would get reformatted, but the vast majority (perhaps all) of the files on the drive would be still intact, but no longer linked to a directory.\nIf the drive was ejected before it could write the first backup, you would have great luck using a commercial file recovery program. On Mac, you would get Data Rescue 3 or similar to undelete the files.\nIf the Mac couldn't erase the drive, that might be the best case for you since it wouldn't start backing up (which will begin to write new files on all the \"free space\" that it thinks contains no old files). If you see a empty disk with a directory Backups.backupdb - that implies that the format was successful and the Mac is ready to write files which will over-write free space and in time ensure that none of the old pictures are recoverable.\nI'd say - get a hold of someone that has done drive recovery before and/or get a quote from a company like Kroll Ontrack so that you know what your options are.\nThe more data that gets written to the drive and the more uncertain you are about exactly what happened will increase the work needed to recover the files, but I would guess you only have to pay for software and time to get some if not most of the pictures back. If you performed the recovery yourself, you'll need a third hard drive to store the recovered files (or store them on the Mac if there is space) and the $99 software which you might be able to download and try for free.\nIf these files were PC formatted, you might have better luck with a PC recovery software, but I've used Data Rescue on many PC drives in the past and had good luck and not needed to send the drive out for professional recovery - so you may not need anything other than what I have listed above.\n", "Q: Mac Book Air mid-2012 completely disappeared disk I've tried to wake up my Mac Book Air from sleep today, but I got a black screen.\nAfter waiting 10 min, I decided to shut it off by holding the power button a few sec.\nAfter restarting, I had a question mark folder flashing.

Is there any way I can import them or something?\n\nA: You can only manually add photos to photostream from iPhoto or Aperture not from the iOS device currently,\nSo you'd need to sync with iPhoto and manually add to photostream through that.\n\nA: Not true, on your iOS device just select as many photos as you want from your Camera Roll, then Share > Photo stream.  This shows up in iPhoto for the Mac and saves a step.  \n", "Q: Delete iCloud bookmark only from a specific computer I have iCloud Safari bookmark syncing set up on two Macs and an iPhone. Is it possible to delete a bookmark (or set of bookmarks) from one machine only, so that they continue to exist on the other two devices?\n\nA: As any changes performed to an iCloud-Sync service will  be pushed to all other iCloud-Sync devices, your only option would be to unsync the desired device form iCloud's Safari and then delete the bookmarks. \nBear in mind that once you re-enable the Safari's Sync, all of its data will be merged together. \n\nA: Cleaning iCloud Bookmarks Procedure:\nTurn off bookmark syncing on all devices and on computer.\nClean /file /sort Safari bookmarks. Quit Safari. \nLocate bookmarks.plist Safari folder in ~/Library. Drag to the desktop. \nStart Safari. Bookmarks should be blank. \nTurn Safari bookmarks sync back on. Let it sync to iCloud. \nQuit Safari, move the ,plist back ~/Library/Safari.\nStart Safari. Edited bookmark .plist is back in place. Let it sync to iCloud.\n", "Q: What is the Bonjour option in iMessage for? iMessage has a Bonjour option but there isn't any explanation on what this all is about. So what can I do with this?\n\nA: When Bonjour is enabled in Messages it allows you to chat with other users on the same network who also have Bonjour enabled. As described in Bonjour For Developers:\n\nBonjour, also known as zero-configuration networking, enables automatic discovery of devices and services on a local network using industry standard IP protocols.\n\nThis was developed some years ago to enable easy configuration of printers and other network services without needing to know ports, addresses, etc.  Messages simply ties into this service.\nJabber is a messaging protocol.  It underlies several protocols such as AIM and Google Chat.\niMessage is a messaging protocol. Messages is the chat application.\n", "Q: Why can't I move the first Desktop in Mission control? All spaces are moveable between each other except the first. Why?\n\nA: The first desktop is considered the master all of others (more like the one ring of Lord of the rings ... One ring to rule them all) ...\nFor example, if you try changing the background on one of your desktops, it will only change for this one. Except the first one will change the background of all your desktops.\n\nA: I just discovered a solution, at least for 10.9.3.\nEnable the option \"Displays have separate Spaces\" in \"System Preferences\" -> \"Mission Control\". This make it possible to move all Desktops, including Dashboard as shown in George Garside animation above.\nI think this makes the accepted answer (at least partly) incorrect.\n\nA: Whilst this might not answer the 'why'…\nMoving the first desktop in Mission Control is at least possible in Mavericks.\n\n\nA: This was possible in 10.9, but it seems to have been disabled in 10.9.1\n", "Q: Slow start up following File Vault 2 Trial on Mountain Lion I spent a week with file vault 2 running but found the startup time of my 2012 Retina MBP was excessively slow (5+ mins on the grey apple screen after the spinning white thingo stops) along with the track pad becoming unresponsive for minutes at a time. I assumed/suspected it was file vault and turned it back off.\nHowever the problem didn't go away so I erased the drive, installed a clean OS and it restarted perfectly. I then restored my full system from time machine and the problem came back (this probably shouldn't have been a surprise). I then erased and reinstalled again but this time used migration assistant to just restore home folder, applications and settings. The problem remains.\nDoes anyone have an idea that doesn't involve me manually reinstalling and rebuilding everything piece by piece? The thought of getting all my preferences back to how they are almost makes me want to put up with the problem.\n\nA: This issue fixed itself when I upgraded to Mavericks. Very very weird that an os upgrade fixes something a clean reinstall didn't.\n", "Q: Do more desktops occupy more ram? I was an exposè addict and so do I am for mission control.\nI was wondering if for many desktop you have \"instantiated\" the more your computer slows.\nSince I am a developer i always have at least 5 screens, does this impact on performances or it is just a really bit thing in front of actual software running in those desktops?\n\nA: I've never seen a single instance here I could pin a performance issue on Mission Control having 5 spaces instead of 15 instead of one.\nSomething else always seems to be the constraint such as RAM pressure or IO pressure. The code that manages the window system already treats each layer virtually and the math is done in some heavily optimized routines and the data structures there are quite well designed so although in theory - tracking more pixels could be a problem for performance, in reality it isn't.\n\nIf you are skeptical, you can reboot your Mac and do this test:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open whatever set of Apps and documents you want to test with.\n\n*Enter Mission control and delete all the spaces except for one.\n\n*Open terminal and run vm_stat 60\n\n*Watch for a few minutes to be sure all the running processes are done allocating RAM. Switch to each App and hide or show the windows you want for your test. Once the free and active numbers are steady - open mission control and leave it open for a minute or two - then go back and inspect RAM allocations.\n\n*Add another 10 spaces and see how RAM allocations change.\n\n*Move app windows to any desktop and verify that no significant RAM allocation changes happen when you are using Mission Control and that they only happen when an app opens a new document or window. \n\n\nYes - if you tend to keep more things open when you have more \"virtual space\", that takes more RAM, but the fact that you have X apps and Y windows open is what takes the RAM - not which of Z mission control virtual screens you have open at any one time.\n\nA: Like @yesterday I split again my windows to better arrange workspace into \" 10 desktops \" and everything is totaly slow down again ⬇️ - \" google meet \" finally kill it and freeze whole machine  - cannot figure where is issue , CPU or GPU or MEM , so I can buy accordingly new machine .\nSo I run \" htop \" and watch.\nFor evey new desktop where I put new windows - RAM was filled with another +250 MB of some data. BUT when I shrink them to 1 space nothnig happened - that data was still occupied. So for me it is \" 10 x 250 MB = 2.5 GB for nothig \" ! OH\nSo when there was no free RAM it was used SWAP - then SSD have high IO.\nThis is something that Apple have fix that.\nSo by my little test - YES definitely \" more desktops occupy more memory \".\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide title bar of Firefox 22 in OS X 10.8.4 Is there any way to hide or remove Firefox 22 title bar in OS X 10.8.4?\n\nA: Short answer: no\nIt has been a bug since firefox 13\nEven though autohide is set to 'true' the toolbars won't hide in fullscreen.\nBest option is to go to view -> Toolbars and uncheck the toolbars in the top menu\nBut this leaves the 'tab toolbar'\nSo if you really want to hide the toolbars you should open the page in a different browser.\n\nA: No, not in FF 22, that feature will be introduced in Firefox 28.\n", "Q: How do i help for Ford Sync hear my demands better? My Ford Sync does not seem to hear me when i request to make a call, or when I tell it who to call..  is there something i need to do or change in my settings.  I have it paired with a iphone 4.  thanks\n\nA: My wife has a Fiesta with the Ford Sync system and she had a similar question when we first purchased it.  When she was giving voice commands she was directing her voice to her iPhone 4, either by holding it up to her face or holding it in front of her.  The problem though is that the Sync system uses a microphone built into the car, not your iPhone, for receiving voice commands.  I'm not at home so I can't say with 100% certainty but I'm pretty sure her microphone is to the left of the rear view mirror.  With that said the location may depend on whichever Ford model you have.\nI would check the Ford's owner manual, it should show the location.\n", "Q: JAVA_HOME error while maven build, OSX-10.8.4 Version Error: JAVA_HOME is not defined correctly.\n  We cannot execute\n  /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home/bin/java\n\nI have upgraded my OSX to 10.8.4.

Some kind of script or app. \nThanks!\n\nA: There are a number of apps which will show you how your disk space is being used. My preference is OmniDiskSweeper which is free. Launch it and have it search your $HOME folder (⌘ + Shift + H) and it will sort the directories according to disk usage.\n\nA: You can also enable calculating all sizes from the view options in Finder:\n\nYou can show hidden files by running defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true; killall Finder.\nPart of the disk space could be taken up by /var/vm/sleepimage if you have a laptop, or by /Volumes/MobileBackups if you use Time Machine.\nRelated questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reducing Lion OS Footprint by removing unnecessary files/folders\n\n*How can I figure out what's slowly eating my HD space?\n\nA: CleanMyMac 2 works for me too.\nAmazingly simple.

Now vim won't launch, all kinds of things are screwed up, and I can't get rid of this mess.\nHow do I uninstall this nonsense? I'm on 10.8, so pkgutil --unlink no longer works.\n\nA: if you can use pkgutil on a file you know for sure came from the python 2.7 you installed you can do\npkgutil --file-info /path/to/the/file\n\nCopy/paste the pkgid in\npkgutil --file pkgid\n\nThat will spit out a list of files that came with python 2.7 -- you can now go ahead and remove them (with all due care not to remove any unrelated file in the same directories etc).\n", "Q: Can I have the same Apple ID in my iPhone and my iPad How can I have de same Apple ID in my iPhone and my iPad (so that I can use the apps on iPad that I have in iPhone and \"vice versa\")\n\nA: Sure you can. Go into Settings and find the following tabs:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes and App Store\n\n*iCloud\nThen just log in with your Apple ID. They must be same in iPhone and iPad in order to share app purchases.\n\nA: The best way is to use one Apple ID among all of your Apple ID devices. In rear cases you will need separate Apple ID accounts when you need to separate contacts or other private info. In this case you should use different Apple ID in Settings > iCloud, but still use the same Apple ID for purchasing content in App Store and iTunes Store on both devices.\n\nA: If you had your iPad first then before you do go into settings>iCloud scroll down>find my iPad and turn it off.\nIf you had your iPhone first do the same thing but go on find my iPhone and turn that off.\n\nA: Do you mean login app store with the same Apple ID and password  for app installation? Sure you can, and actually the app you have installed on your iPad can be directly sync to your iPhone.\n\nA: Be sure to only use one Apple ID since it becomes confusing by having two Apple ID's.

Both the App Store and softwareupdate report that there are no updates available even though I know full well that there is a Java update and iTunes is not the latest version. What is wrong with it?\n\nA: Do you have a non admin user account? Then available system updates and updates for Apple software will not show in the Mac App Store when invoking Software Update. What you can do is the following: Open Mac App Store, click on „Updates“ and then press cmd-R. A dialogue will open asking for your admin name and password.

Macbook Pro Mid 2012, original SSD.\nTLDR; Why could I clone my unmountable drive from an external enclosure but not internally?\nMy SSD broke down a few days ago. It was detected, but I was unable to mount it, and I got I/O errors when trying to clone (restore in Disk Utility) the drive (no logs saved). After Disk Utility and DiskWarrior failed to resolve the issue I put the internal SSD into an external enclosure. From the enclosure I was suddenly able to clone the drive. My question is, what possible explanations for this are there? My guess is that the SATA connector is damaged, but I hope I'm wrong.\nUpdate: A fresh install (made from the external enclosure) still has the same mounting issues when booted internally. \nUpdate 2: After a few more hours of research I'm more or less convinced that the cable is toast. Apparently it's a common occurrence with certain Macbook models. \n\nA: I replaced the cable, and everything is now back to normal. So, as I suspected, the cable was the culprit.\nInstructions on how to replace the SATA cable is easily found online \n(search for things like replace hard drive cable macbook).\nThe only tricky part was to connect the sleep LED to the cable, but if you just check how the old cable is connected you'll be fine.\n", "Q: Applescript to delete iMessages from Messages app I have an Applescript that sends myself and colleagues iMessages when certain events happen.

What are some good USB plugged-in/pluggable speakers for Macbook Pro 13\" Late 2011?\nMy MacBook Pro late 2011 has its headphone jackets broken due to a stuck headphone jack, and my warranty's out. Also in the sound pane the sound output device listed is \"Digital Out\"\nSo as my headphone jack is out, and as I don't have a compatible \"Digital Out\" device, I'd like to know if there are any USB Pluggable speakers available which function by getting plugged into the USB port instead of being plugged into the headphone socket. \n\nA: I can recommend the 'SoundSticks I' from Harman Kardon, a very good 3-way Sound System. The first Generation had an USB-Interface, the later Models had the usual Headphone Jacks. You can get it from E-Bay, usually for less than 80$.\nOne important thing: You cannot use them on a USB-Hub, you have to connect them directly to you machine.\n\nA: Although wireless speakers are far more popular these days, there's a good selection of USB computer speakers for your MacBook. Note there are 2 types of USB speakers: Digital with a single USB connection - and Analog which have w2 wires that are powered by USB but still use the 1/8\" analog headphone/audio jack.\nSo, your ailing headphone jack means you need to shop carefully to find 1-Cable all Digital speakers that deliver both stereo audio and power over just a USB connection. You can find a good selection of these at this USB speaker site\nSome are compact and oblong 1 piece speakers designed for MacBook travel. On your desktop, 2-piece USB computer speakers are a better choice for wider stereo separation and ambience - and tend to have larger drivers for wider frequency response and more bass.\n", "Q: Erased Macintosh HD and installing OS X Lion again I erased my Macintosh HD from Disk Utility with a journaled encrypted format and I wanted to install OS X 10.7 Lion.

What can I do?\n\nA: Is it this prohibitory sign?\n\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht2674:\n\nCircle with Slash - could not load boot.efi, or some other issue\n\nDoes the Mac shut down after it shows the sign? http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3742:\n\nIf there are five new kernel panics within three minutes, the Mac will display a prohibitory sign for 30 seconds, and then shut down.\n\nYou could try repairing the disk or the OS X partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold command-R on startup\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*Select the disk (like APPLE HDD HTS541010A9E662 Media) and press the Repair Disk button\n\n*Select the OS X partition (like Macintosh HD) and press the Repair Disk button\n\n\nYou could also try erasing and reinstalling again, but choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) instead of Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted). You can enable FileVault later from System Preferences.\nIf the drive is grayed out in Disk Utility or not shown when you try to reinstall OS X, you might need to replace it with another drive.\n\nA: Hold cmd + R together whilst booting and it will bring you into internet recovery. Type in your Username and the password. After that a gray screen will come up. Go to Disk Utility and erase Macintosh HD, then go back and click on reinstall Mac OS X which will get a new copy of the OS.\n", "Q: Making an app window smaller on a mac When I open some apps, the window for the app is huge.  I know I can resize the window by going to bottom right and corner and using mouse. I was just wondering is there some quicker way using keys etc?\n\nA: Well, there are some tricks in OS X Lion and above. \nSince OS X Lion you can use any window edge for resizing.\nIf you hold down the option key, you can also resize a window by expanding or decreasing opposite sides of a window at the same time.\nIf you hold down the shift key while you expand or contract a window, the window will maintain its original aspect ratio.\nAlso you can combine option and shift.\nIf you want keyboard shortcuts (not built-in there) you can use 3rd party software like http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/26411/mercurymover.\n\nA: If you don't mind using an add-on, take a look at ShiftIt.  It allows you to use keys to move the window to left side, right side, top, bottom, lower left, upper right, etc.\nhttps://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt\nFrom the dev's website:\n\n\nA: If the window is not in fullscreen mode (i.e. where the yellow \"minimize\" button is greyed out) you can double click the header bar of the window. That will resize it to be the full width of the screen minus the computer's top bar. Then, when you double click it again, it will shrink to the size it was before you first double clicked it.\nThis way you can, say, have a window occupying one half of the screen, then double click to enlarge it to full, then double click again to go back to the same half.\n", "Q: Using PhotoStream on the Mac for pics transfer I want to transfer pics from my iPhone to my Mac. I've had Photo Stream on for over a year, and I had it turned on my Mac as well. I don't use iPhoto. I have a Smart Folder setup so that I can access my pics that way. When I delete a picture from my Photo Stream on my iPhone, is it supposed to delete from the Smart Folder? I experimented with it this morning and the image remains in that Mac folder. This makes me think that the images, once synced to the Mac, are permanently there until I manually delete from the Mac (even if it's no longer in my iPhone Photo Stream album).\nAdditionally, there are over 1000+ images, plus images older than 30 days in this current Mac folder. I've tried reading up on Photo Stream, but everything I've read makes me think that the images should be deleted from the Smart folder.\nDoes this mean that I can safely delete images from my iPhone since I have a permanent copy of these images on my Mac - or should I copy the images from the Smart Folder to a regular folder? I don't want to make unnecessary duplicates of the images, but I don't want to lose them either!\n\nA: Once Photostream images are exported to the Mac, they can safely be removed from your iPhone camera roll or from the Photostream itself. The images on the computer are local copies and are no longer directly tied to the Photostream. The photos will remain on your computer until you delete them. \n\nSince your Mac and PC have more storage than your iOS devices, you can choose to have all of your My Photo Stream photos automatically downloaded. In iPhoto or Aperture preferences on your Mac, be sure to select Photo Stream > My Photo Stream > Automatic Import. All of your photo stream photos will be imported into your Events, Projects, Photos, Faces, and Places folders in iPhoto or Aperture. On your PC with Photo Stream enabled in the Control Panel, all of your photos will be imported into C:\\Users\\\\Pictures\\Photo Stream\\My Photo Stream. \n\nᔥ Apple Knowledgebase: iCloud: Photo Stream FAQ\n", "Q: Easiest way to create a graphical representation of Application Usage Report? I have several mac users who claim they need all 3 major browsers for testing websites and they need Admin privileges to keep them updated. (My Company doesn't support but Safari.) \nI have run an Application Usage report for the last year on these users to pull what applications where used, how long, etc etc..\nI have the data in Excel and I am trying to 'pie' chart the data so I can see what application they are really using the most. I have already split each user up into individual sheets. Has anyone else solved this problem (using Excel or even another tool)?\n\nA: Presuming that you want to have a pie chart for each user, and you want to group by application, and by time spent with each, I would recommend using Excel to do so. In a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a PivotChart for each user, with the data grouped as you prefer. In my exercise, I selected Application and Time. Highlight the columns, with the top row being the header, and select Insert | PivotChart. Check the fields to add to the report, in this case Application and Time.\n\n*You can configure your chart to your liking. I tend to add value labels to my pie chart slices.\n\n\nYou can see my crude, 5 minute example below.\n\n", "Q: Getting per-user websites working on Mountain Lion server I followed the instructions at this question but I am getting 404s when trying to access http://localhost/~user.\nThe httpd error log shows the following message:\n[Tue Jul 23 20:34:34 2013] [error] [client ::1] File does not exist: /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default/~user\n\nThe userdir module is being loaded, and the Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf line is not commented out.\nIf I put a deliberate error in /etc/apache2/users/user.conf, apachectl configtest will fail, so it is reading this file — which means /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf is fine as well.\nWithout the error, user.conf reads\n<Directory \"/Users/user/Sites/\">\n    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymlinks\n    AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nand httpd-userdif.conf reads\n# Settings for user home directories\n#\n# Required module: mod_userdir\n\n#\n# UserDir: The name of the directory that is appended onto a user's home\n# directory if a ~user request is received.

I have two Dymo label printers. I tried installing the printer using CUPS web admin as well as the Print & Scan under System Preferences. Both printers installed fine. When I print from either the print jobs are sent to only one of the two. The purpose of two printers is to avoid the constant changing of label sizes. \n\nIf it helps: my goal is to have two printers available. One prints large labels. The other prints small labels. When i go to print, I am able to choose which printer to print from.\n\nA: Dymo label drivers are quite picky and ask that you not connect the devices until the installer asks specifically for the device to be connected. I believe that is to prevent both queues going to the first device in the USB chain, but I don't have two to test with.\nI would delete both printer definitions and start with the installer from here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://dymo.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/101/~/dymo-drivers-and-downloads#lw_mac\nThe read me has the following caution:\n\nNOTE: Do not connect the USB cable to your computer or USB hub until\n  instructed to do so during the software installation. If you have a\n  label printer already installed, disconnect the USB cable from your\n  computer before running the installer and reconnect the cable when\n  instructed to do so.\n\nSo you could try deleting only one queue and then disconnecting the printer that printed from the other queue and try setting up the second printer again.\n", "Q: Add shortcut for iTerm on Mountain Lion I am trying to add shortcut for opening iTerm when I press F1.

My girlfriend has an Android phone and when she text me on my new iPhone, emoji like ;-) appear as is and not as a winking smiley. Is there a way to change that?\n\nA: The emojis sent by the iPhone are particular characters (cf Emoji on Wikipedia)\nIf you see a smiley, it means that the android phones is probably converting the smiley into images on the phone directly but it seends only the text corresponding to the smiley to the reciever. \nSince the iPhone does not change the smileys into emojis (at least without jailbreak), you will not be able to see the emojis. \nNB: You can also make a test by sending emoji between an iPhone and a Windows Phone. You'll see that each phone will display its own emojis, since it's the system who has a set of images corresponding to the emoji characters. \nTLDR : Your girlfriend's phone doesn't seem to send emojis characters but simple smileys.\n", "Q: how do I write a homebrew recipe?

Over the past few days I've noticed that my trackpad has started to become finicky: it's hard to pinch, the cursor occasionally \"jumps\" and sometimes gets stuck so badly that it can only move on one axis (e.g., can only move left or right).  After restarting and resetting VRAM things seem to momentarily be fixed: but I don't know if this is strictly power of suggestion.  The fact that the cursor is stuck and that restarting helps fix the problem implies to me that the problem may be in part software related.\nI've seen previous threads that suggest replacing the cable and that this was a frequent problem in previous generations of the MBP.  My mac is still under warranty, but I wondered if there may be any software causes that I should investigate.\nIf things don't pan out, I can always take it to a store.\n\nA: Does it act the same on battery power?  Or, can you switch the powersupply plug to the long bulky power cord?\nIf being on battery clears up this problem, then you may have a ground problem (at least, I have identified this mouse-jerk issue on one mbp).  This is also the cause of the 'tingling' that is sometimes felt when you stroke the aluminium case.\nA lack/failure to ground occurs under many conditions.  E.g., power supply uses the direct plug rather than the heavy power cord as the direct plastic power plugs don't transmit ground.  Or, there is a ground problem further upstream (dodgy power board or UPS, dodgy electrics in building).  Or, something metal being touched is actually charged (scary).  Or, some combination of effects.\nIf not grounded, the voltage inside the Mac \"floats\" away from ground, leading to weird effects when you touch the machine, as you are effectively a different ground competing for a different level.  And, touching is exactly what you do when using the trackpad.\n\nA: The left button on my MacBook Pro (mid 2012) failed to work since this morning. I tried three reboots and nothing would get it working.\nAs soon as I plugged in the power cord the left clicked started working. I pulled the power cable out and the mouse button kept working.\nWeird power/ground issue IMHO.\n", "Q: How to configure Static IP on iPhone I Want to use wifi on my iphone, Anybody can help me.\nI am already using my laptop on the same network through static IP.

I'm a developer, and I'm working on a cross-platform app that have to run on Mac OS X, Win7 and Win8. Unfortunately it's impossible to test my app in VM due to some hardware restrictions, so I have to install all of them on bare hardware.\nI've bought Mac Mini 2012, but unfortunately I cannot find out how to install all 3 OSes on it. Boot Camp only allows to install single instance of Windows.\nIs it even possible to have Mac OS X, Win7 and Win8 on the machine (with and without Boot Camp)?\n\nA: I have done this myself. First install REFIt, an utility for dual/triple booting. It adds a useful selection of OSes on startup. It also includes a EFI/MBR fixing tool which is very useful. You might need to restart 2 times. Using the Disk Utility, add 2 more partitions to your disk. Format them FAT or FAT32. Restart your machine, and this time, assuming you have installed REFIt, instead of choosing OS X, navigate to the partition inspector (the hard drive icon). Just apply the settings it suggests. \nReboot your mac and put the windows 8 disc in. The setup will allow you to format the partitions. Format both of the partitions. Install to the first partition. After installing drivers (optional) etc on win8, restart and install win7 to the other partition. \nSometimes the Win8 will find Win7 installed and integrate the bootloader. That means that in REFIt, choosing either one of Win7/Win8 won't boot. Choosing Win7/Win8 from REFIt will give you the option to boot Win7 or Win8. Hope this helps.\nNB: Your Windows partitions won't be named. REFIt won't know which is win7/win8. Or you can name it when you've installed the first Windows.\n\nA: Another option: Get a fast external hard drive with a USB 3 or Thunderbolt interface, and install a second instance of Mac OS X on it. Boot from Mac OS X on the external hard drive, and use it to create a BootCamp partition on the external drive, and install Windows 7 or Windows 8 on that. At bootup, with the Option key held down, you could select whether you want to boot from Mac OS X or Windows 7 on your internal hard drive, or Windows 8 on your external hard drive (which also has a Mac OS X partition that you created solely for the purpose of installing and configuring Windows 8 under BootCamp). \n\nA: Perhaps you are trying the wrong strategy.\nGiven your needs as a developer, why not consider purchasing two inexpensive Windows PCs, one to run Windows 7, and one to run Windows 8, and then hooking up those two machines and your Mac mini with a KVM switch so that you can use the one keyboard, mouse and monitor to control all three computers, which are all up and running simultaneously? \nIt seems to me that you would save a great deal of time because you would never have to reboot into another OS to test something. With only one monitor, keyboard and mouse, and the two other PCs on the floor, you would not take up any extra desk space either.\n\nWith a router nearby, you could connect all three computers with Ethernet or WiFi and set them up for file sharing through the different operating systems, or using various versions of VNC. Then you could easily move documents and files from the Mac to the Windows 7 or Windows 8 environments in real-time while all three are up and running.\nYou could purchase new desktop PCs with a 500GB hard drive, 4GB RAM, and a licensed copy of Windows 8 or Windows 7 for perhaps US $300 each.\nAlternately, you could purchase only one $300 Windows computer and set that up to dual-boot into either Windows 7 or Windows 8. You would still use the KVM switch between your Mac mini and the one Windows PC, and that would cut down somewhat on the amount of time you lost rebooting between different OS. But I think purchasing two cheap Windows boxes alongside your Mac mini would be the way to go.\n\nA: Although I do not have a mac mini myself and am not sure that this would work entirely but it theres no harm in giving it a shot.\nProceed with installing either windows 7 or windows 8 as a single partition and follow the boot camp wizard to get it installed like normal.\nOnce you are in the windows 7 environment, try partitioning the drive and see if you can install windows 8 onto that along with the boot camp drivers and whatnot.\nOnce again I am not entirely not sure if this would be a solution but its an idea thats worth putting out there. Hope it helps!\n\nA: I'd also say go for the external drive if you prefer not to hassle with a 3rd party bootloader that is no longer maintained actively. Or maybe the Mini has place for a 2nd internal drive (instead of the optical, if you have a model that still had one).\nNote that you don't need to reinstall OS X to the extra drive, you can just clone your existing install with a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner. It's always a good idea to have a bootable clone of your boot disk, even with current day Recovery Partitions and TimeMachine backups.\nOr, you could have 2 versions of OS X, of course, as a developer that may be of interest too (esp. if you're also targeting OS X 10.6).\n\nA: Parallels works great for this! I have multiple Linux distro's, Windows 7 and Windows 8 installed AND you can even run Windows software without actually being in the Windows environment, which I love!\n", "Q: my ipod classic 160gb is not recognised in my computer when connected but is still charging My Ipod Classic 160gb is not being recognised in my computer or itunes when connected but is still charging.

The macpro has Small Tree gigabit ethernet cards allowing 12 workstations to be connected at any one time, allowing all users to access the same storage pool (the proavio raid). In terms of performance, the setup works fine. We've had 4 users editing full Hd compressed video across the ethernet network.\nThe problem i'm having is that in the OSX server prefs for the shared storage, I need to set the permissions to \"ignore permissions on this volume\" for users to be able to read / write to the drive.\nI don't have a strong IT background (i'm a designer) but I have the feeling that the setup is incorrect in some way.\nIn addition to this bug, i'd also like to set up the system so that only the administrator of the server can delete files from the shared storage (password required). The reason being that we work with freelancers and interns who are not always safety savvy....!\nAny light that can be shed on this by you brilliant people would be much appreciated.\nThanks,\nJ.\n\nA: You seem to have two opposing goals. You would like that users can freely share and modify each others files, but preventing them from deleting them by mistake.\nThe probably best way to achieve this is to user ACLs (Access Control Lists). ACLs allow for additional, more fine-grained permissions,  see http://support.apple.com/kb/PH8010 for some official Apple docs. In this case you would have to turn off the ignore permissions on this volume setting.\nUnfortunately this is rather technical, and probably requires you to at least initially set it up with the Terminal.app, although some of this can also be done in the Server.app, but it will allow you to set up so that everybody can read and write to a directory and it's files and to prevent non-admins from deleting a file. Note: it probably will not prevent someone from destroying the file reducing it's size to zero, thereby de facto deleting the file, so do not get fooled into a false sense of security.\n", "Q: Exclude a mailbox from \"All Inboxes\" or compose a custom multiple inbox view I have recently added my work mailbox to my iphone. \nI have several other mailboxes that I use for non work purposes.

I was just wondering if Apple would swap my Optical Drive on my MacBook Pro for an SSD, and how much it would cost, as I would rather they do it and I keep my warranty then doing it myself and losing my warranty. I have AppleCare if that makes a difference, and the laptop is also still in it's 1st year warranty.\nI would be supplying the SSD and bracket and cable and anything else needed to fit the SSD into the MacBook Pro.\n\nA: I'd be very surprised if they would - there's no standard Apple product to replace an optical drive with an SSD. \nYou'd either need to do it yourself using any one of the third-party optical bay solutions (see this question) or have a third party hardware repair firm do it for you. In both cases, however, you'd be voiding your Apple warranty as the optical drive is not a user serviceable part.\n\nA: Whilst an Apple Retail Store may not do this for you, i'm pretty sure an Apple Certified Technician would do this for you.\nUse this locator, click on service and enter your post code for a list in your area.\n", "Q: Remember network share user name but not password I regularly connect to a remote file store (webDAV) that uses different credentials to my OSX user account.

If it's something that lets you enter (& memorize) an explicit URL (e.g. in the Finder's Connect to Server dialog), you can enter the URL in the form \"https://username@server\".

If so, what security measures should I be taking?  Should I be removing the hard drive or do I not have to worry about it?\n\nA: In my opinion, there is no need for concern. I genuinely believe that it is highly improbable that someone would take the time to retrieve data off an old hard drive. In time old credit card numbers that might be stored will expire. Perhaps you can change the passwords of frequently used websites. Thats a good measure anyway. So essentially the data would be useless.

(or two)\n\n\n*\n\n*\"ScreenRecycler\" http://www.screenrecycler.com/ScreenRecycler.html\n\n*\"AirDisplay\" http://avatron.com/apps/air-display\nI have used it, it works, but it's much better over an Ethernet connection instead of WiFi just be forewarned.\nAlso, you could use a (~$50) USB -> DVI adapter with the DisplayLink software for Mac and just add the monitor to your computer via USB, but honestly the performance is going to be about the same as AirDisplay over Ethernet (you just wouldn't have to run the other computer)\nAnyway I have used both methods and found them to be very useable for mostly text-based work as a secondary screen.\n", "Q: How to mirror a first screen on the second and keep the highest resolution on the first screen? I've linked a second screen (1920x1080) to my iMac 27\" (2560x1440) via HDMI (using a minidisplayport to HDMI adapter).\nI want to mirror the first on the second but when I do this the first takes the resolution of the second which is lower. If instead I choose to extend the first on the second then the first keeps it resolution, but I can't access Mac OS X's interface from the second, only the windows I move to it.\nThe solution needs to work for 2 external screens.\n\nA: In order to access Mac OS interface from another screen, go to System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement and take a look at the blue rectangles that represent the screens you currently have connected. One of them should have a white bar at the top, drag this bar to the screen that you want to access the OS interface from. That way you can keep the higher resolution, and access the interface. Unfortunately, if you mirror a display, it will take the lowest resolution because it cannot \"create\" the pixels required on the lower resolution screen in order to show a Mirrored display. If you want to keep the higher resolution, you have to extend the displays.\n\nA: There might not currently be (no existing software) a way to mirror a display and keep each displays' highest resolution but, since mirroring is used for displays that are in separate rooms (I assume, otherwise the other screen would serve as an extension) then it's possible to use some softwares that let you save all windows size and position and restores them automatically when a display is plugged/unplugged or mirror mode is activated/deactivated.\nStay ($15) does exclusively this.\nMoom ($10) does this (with a slightly less evident setup) plus other windows positioning tricks.\nN.B. some windows that are not real system windows could be impossible to save/restore, such as X11 and the Adobe Suite.\nI found them at tool to remember window positions when I plug in/unplug an external display and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/533569/remember-window-sizes-and-placement-when-unplugging-and-replugging-second-monito\n", "Q: Do all computers/devices connected to an airport extreme run at the same speed? My mom just bought an Airport Extreme router recently, and she said the salesperson at the Apple Store told her that all devices on a network run at the same connection speed, and that speed is determined by the slowest device on the network. So if you have a shiny new Mac that has the potentential to run at 1 Gbit/second, you'll be slowed down to a 10 Mbit/second speed, just because you have your old phone connected to the wifi, downloading some apps at the same time. This doesn't really make any sense to me. \n(Please don't speculate, I can do that myself. Answer if you have experience with this topic).\n\nA: No - this is demonstrably false for Airport hardware even before the latest generation where 802.11ac is introduced.\nSimply connect two or three Mac at different distances (1m, 5m, 10m) and run wireless diagnostic on each.  You will see different transmit rates and MCS index for each device which correlates to how fast the radio link between each device and the base station is based on current interference and signal to noise ratios. \n\nA: It's flat out wrong, you can go into Airport Utility, check the connected clients list and see the connection speed and quality of all devices which will vary greatly.\nThe only time slowest common denominator comes into effect is when you exit the router to another network (typically the internet), and even a poor connection to your airport is likely to be faster than your internet connection - an old fashioned Wireless G connection to your router from say an old iPhone 3G might run at up to 54Mbps, and unless you are on a Fibre net connection this will likely be faster than the bottleneck which is your net speed.\nOne time when it might come into play internally to your network is if your machines ever talk to each other rather then as most people do and just use the router to hit the internet.  If you have a device running at 54Mbps (say an old Windows netbook) and it's doing a file transfer to your new iMac running at 1Gbps, then obviously the speed is limited by the slowest device, but only for that specific piece of network traffic and it cannot affect anything else.\n\nA: According to  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac \none of the new things in 802.11ac is \"Coexistence mechanisms for 20/40/80/160 MHz channels, 11ac and 11a/n devices\".  But I have no ac device to try it out on.\n", "Q: Web pages won't load but network is working I can't get web pages to load on my MacBook Pro. Airport connects with the router and ping tests work fine (on www.google.com) but web pages aren't loading in any browser in any user account. Internet works on all other devices.\nWorked fine until yesterday when it just stopped working.\nUpdate:\nVery strange. I tried three routers and had the same problem with all of them. I then created a new admin user account on my Mac and the internet worked on it. When I returned to my own account - the internet was working again!\nAny idea why this would happen? It seems creating a new admin account and then coming back solved it.\n\nA: I had the same problem; I tried everything and nothing seemed to work!\nFortunately I solved the problem after many disappointments; I hope it works for you too.\nHere's what I did: I went to network preferences, on the left side you can see a WiFi icon. I chose it and then deleted it, then turned off my Mac (I didn't restart it, I just turned it off) and then turned it on again. Then again I went to network preferences and clicked on the + to add a connection, then chose WiFi to create and then my problem was solved.\n\nA: Deleting the wifi icon and shutting down fixed the same issue for me as well\n\nA: Did you flush your DNS cache? \nIn 10.6, and prior, the method was to issue\ndscachutil -flushcache\nfrom a Terminal prompt.\nBut on Lion and Mountain Lion it's different:\nWhat works under 10.7 and forward is:\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nA: Try looking in the System Preference/Network panel for your active network connection.  Highlight the connection, click Advanced, then check the different tabs to see if any information is statically entered.  Specifically, check under Proxies.  Any sort of manual override under your account could be at fault.\n\nA: Try a new DNS server, use Open DNS numbers and see if that doesn’t get you fully online with 10.9.2.\n", "Q: How to send and receive iMessages from my phone number on my MacBook Air with Mountain Lion I recently downloaded Mountain Lion because I wanted to be able to send and receive iMessages from my phone number on my MacBook Air. But, for some reason I'm not able to add my number to my Mac. When I send a text from my Mac, the receiver gets a message from my apple ID not my phone number. I've tried to go the Messages and the Message Preferences but my Message Bar doesn't even have a Preferences tab. I've also tried going to Settings and accessing my Messages Account but I can't find it. I just really want to be able to send a message to my friends from my phone number on my laptop.. Can anyone help?\n\nA: This is simple to accomplish if you have an iPhone to associate your phone number with your Apple ID account. I'm not aware of any way to hack, trick or cajole Apple to add a cell phone number to an Apple ID other than it going through the normal activation process on iPhone only.\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate your Apple ID - http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4268\n\n*Open iMessage on the Mac and in preferences, set the caller ID to initiate messages from your phone number instead of your AppleID email.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, it is allowed to add more emails to an Apple ID, but the adding of phone numbers happens when you activate things from a live phone account and SMS messaging verifies that the phone number matches the iPhone.\nOnce that's done, Apple is happy to let your Mac or iPad or phone \"iMessage\" from that telephone number.\n\nA: You cannot send it from a phone number on your laptop, unfortunately it has to be from your Apple ID. Your laptop does not have a SIM card in it.\n\nA: First, I recommend checking out this question and answer as you may find configuration issues on your phone itself. It is easiest to setup if you are on iOS 6, but will work if you are on iOS 5.\nBased on your mention that friends receive messages from your Apple ID, I concur that (1) at least something is working properly on your end, and that (2) your friend is using iMessage as well.\nThere are two ways to open the preferences dialog in Messages.app. The most straight-forward is to click the \"Messages\" menu in the upper left corner of the screen. You could also use the keyboard shortcut which is ⌘ + ,.\nLikely your biggest key will be to initiate conversations from your phone number. You can do this by selecting, and changing the Start new conversations from: drop down menu.\n", "Q: How do I get make, gcc, clang, Xcode? It has been almost a week as Apple has disabled downloads from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ due to a security breach.\nIf you don't have App Store set up for whichever reason, how are you supposed to be using your brand new Mac for development?\nIs there a copy of Xcode hidden somewhere within a brand new mid-2013 MacBook Air?\nHow do I get Xcode if I don't have an App Store account?  Nothing works without Xcode, I can't even use MacPorts to install the stuff I need, because it all depends on Xcode.\n\nA: Use the OS X GCC Installer. Download it here, since you have a brand new Mac you'll want GCC-10.7-v2.pkg. This will get you GCC, LLVM, clang, the Developer CLI tools, and the DevSDK headers.\n", "Q: Free app asks for a payment to use it? I bought a free app for iPad at the apps store but when I went to use it the app required a99cent fee purchased Thru the app. Is my payment information secure under these circumstances?\n\nA: Yes. In-app purchases are secure just as they are on the actual App Store. Apple provides developers the APIs needed for in-app purchases. My understanding is that one can do purchases in apps through the \"official\" in-app purchase system.\nYou should be able to easily tell the difference between a normal in-app purchase, and a third-party one (which should, but may not be secure). For the official in app purchase, it should prompt you (system type prompt) with the amount of payment and option to cancel. If you choose to pay, it should prompt you for your Apple ID password. You should not have to enter credit card information, or other personal information (if you already have that info tied to your Apple ID account.\n", "Q: MacPorts fails to find 'make' I've installed Xcode and MacPorts on a brand new mid-2013 MacBook Air, but MacPorts doesn't work, saying that it cannot find anything.\nmba:~ cnst$ sudo port install wget\nWarning: The Command Line Tools for Xcode don't appear to be installed; most ports will likely fail to build.\nWarning: See http://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.xcode.html for more information.\n--->  Computing dependencies for wgetError: Unable to execute port: can't read \"build.cmd\": Failed to locate 'make' in path: '/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin' or at its MacPorts configuration time location, did you move it?\nmba:~ cnst$\n\nAnd, indeed, there is no make or clang in the path, but it is definitely installed, though:\nmba:~ cnst$ find /Applications -name \"clang\" -or -name \"make\"\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/make\nmba:~ cnst$\n\nWhy is there no make or clang in the path?

Open Xcode, then hit ⌘+,. Choose the 'Downloads' section, and Components lists the downloadable items.\n\nAssuming that ADC being down hasn't also locked down these utilities, the installation process will take place.\n", "Q: How to get Apple Command Line Developer Tools without App Store? I got a mid-2013 MacBook Air for UNIX development.  I'm disappointed that it came with no C/C++ compilers and with no make, which are apparently part of Apple Command Line Developer Tools, which is supposed to be available for download from Apple Developer Connection, but which has been down for close to a week (and counting) due to some kind of user-database security breach in ADC.\nIf ADC is down, how come Xcode itself doesn't have any problems downloading Command Line Developer Tools, as per the \"MacPorts fails to find 'make'\" question?\nHow can one download make and clang et al without an App Store account, and when ADC is down?  How does Xcode do it?\n\nA: Just get an Apple ID enter payment information for an Apple ID so that it can be used with App Store. You might eventually need it for upgrading the OS or for installing applications.\nIf others find this question after developer.apple.com comes back up, you can download the Command Line Tools package from https://developer.apple.com/downloads. It can also be installed from Xcode's preferences, but most of the binaries are already in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/{usr/bin,Tools}.\n\nA: You do not actually have to have a credit card to get apps from the App Store (don't take my word for this, just see this article from Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2534 ). We have a shared AppleID account set up for our lab. Only free apps (including Xcode) are downloaded using the ID. But it is tricky to set it up.\nYour best bet here (unless you want a 3rd party compiler) is just to get the Xcode tools. It's a huge download, but you end up with what you are looking for, and you won't have to wait for the Developer site to come back online first.\n", "Q: Can a factory unlocked iPhone 5 be used with Sprint?

If FMI is being used currently, the arrow in its box will be purple, and if it was used in the last 24 hours, the arrow in its box will be grey.\nHowever, the user can disable the Find My Iphone feature with a simple toggle in the same menu.\n\nA: The other answer regarding the location services notification icon is absolutely correct, however I would disagree that it's obvious given that many users use location services all the time and seeing the triangle isn't anomalous behavior.\nAnother point of order: if the poster leverages OS X Server's policy manager and configures a policy to prevent it, the user cannot trivially disable the feature.\nA less clandestine approach may be to install the Find Friends app which can let the user know that someone has requested location, but may be preferable to incessant phone calls and messages that demand a response. It may be awkward either way depending on the relationship you have with the user.\n\nA: If that person jailbreaks their phone and installs FMFLive then they will be notified any time you request their location.\n\nA: My friend got an email after someone checked her phone. \n\nDear (User Name),\nYour Apple ID (appleid@email.com) was used to sign in to the Find My iPhone app on a new device.\nDate and Time: September 25, 2014, 8:02 AM PDT\n  Device: iPhone 5s\nIf you recently signed in to the Find My iPhone app, you can disregard this email.\n  If you have not signed in to Find My iPhone recently or you believe someone may have accessed your account, go to My Apple ID (https://appleid.apple.com) and change your password as soon as possible.\nApple Support\n\n", "Q: How can I get my Verizon apple Iphone to straightalk? I have a Verizon iPhone and I want to hook it up with Straight Talk. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: I use my iPhone from Verizon (not unlocked by Verizon) in Thailand, where they don't provide any kind of Straight talk.\nSo I just disabled in Settings all sort of use of my [integrated] US number, and added my Apple ID. Thou it is now used more like iPod Touch, but I am pretty accessible true iMessage, FaceTime, Viber, Facebook, etc... And all this only when I am in a Wi-Fi reachable area.\n\nSo IMO, to not use Verizon services with Verizon iPhone - this would be one option to do so...\n\nA: Your iphone has to be unlocked by Verizon. \nPending your contract they might or might no do that.\nAfter that there is no problem using Straight talk.\n", "Q: Charging problem Can i use Samsung tab 8.9 adapter for charging ipod 5. Will it damage my iPod.I never tried charging my iPod using tabs adapter. I need help. U wont get a adapter for ipod 5 while buying it\n\nA: A standard USB port provides +5v , which is what the iPod uses, so you should be ok, assuming the adapter mimics the power of a USB port, which it should, if it has a Female USB on it.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB\n\nA: You need to check the volts on the adapter and on the iPod. If the adapter works with a higher voltage than the iPod, it will damage it. But I suppose they both use around 5v so that should be okay. Don't worry about the amps tho, your iPod will take what it needs and leave the rest.\n", "Q: netstat: n: unknown or uninstrumented protocol I always use netstat on ubuntu to check which processes are listening on specific ports. I use the following switches with netstat that work fine on ubuntu but on mac fail:\nsudo netstat -tulpn\nnetstat: n: unknown or uninstrumented protocol\n\n\nA: @gordon-davisson is right, but you can still get the pid from netstat on mac with the verbove option. I post an answer as I lack the reputation to comment his answer.\n\nSo, if the question is how to get pid and port in a netstat command, you can still do:\nnetstat -anv\nthe verbose option gives the pid in postition 9 like this:\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)     rhiwat shiwat    pid   epid\ntcp4       0      0  127.0.0.1.3335         *.*                    LISTEN      131072 131072  45710      0\n\nBut the output is plethoric, which is bearable if you know what you look for, like: netstat -anv | grep 3335 or netstat -anv | grep LISTEN\nThe output of lsof is still nicer.\n\nA: Linux's netstat command options and OS X(/BSD)'s have almost nothing to do with each other. Of the options you're invoking, only -n means the same on both, and some of the others (-l and -p) have no equivalent on OS X's netstat. What I habitually use on OS X is netstat -an | grep LISTEN, but that doesn't show UDP or the program involved. I suppose you could use netstat -an | egrep '^udp|LISTEN' to include UDP, but that's rather verbose (and you'll also see quite a bit of nonsense UDP stuff, since there isn't really a concept of UDP listening vs. other states).  If you need to know the program, you need to go to the lsof (list open files) command, and that requires root access to check processes you don't own. Try something like sudo lsof -nPi -sTCP:LISTEN\nEdit: as @loic.jaouen pointed out in another answer, while OS X's netstat doesn't have a direct equivalent to the Linux's -p option, the -v (verbose) display does include the PID of the process, and you can get the program name from that with ps.\n\nA: You can let your Mac \"listen\" on a network interface:\nType sudo tcpdump -i en0 (followed by your administrator password)\n", "Q: Airplane Mode and Do Not Disturb on iPhone 4 I have an iPhone 4 running iOS 6, and Do Not Disturb appears under settings, but Do Not Disturb appears to be ornamental compared to my expectations. More specifically, it at least buzzes when I get a call.\nIf iPhone's default mode is \"push and pull both enabled\", and Airplane Mode is \"push and pull both disabled,\" is there a \"pull enabled, push disabled\" mode? Is that something Do Not Disturb should allow? Or how should Airplane Mode and Do Not Disturb mode be understood for my phone?\n\nA: Airplane Mode and Do Not Disturb perform different functions, neither of which are directly linked to push notifications, but can affect them.\nAirplane Mode is a quick-fire way to turn off all the wireless radios (cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS) on the iPhone. You can subsequently turn on the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios while still in Airplane mode by going to their respective settings toggles. If you have no data connectivity (i.e. cellular data or Wi-Fi), then you can’t receive any data, whether via push or pull. For more details, see Apple’s support article: iOS: Understanding airplane mode.\nDo Not Disturb mode turns off the tones and vibrations from phone calls, SMS/iMessages, and any other push notifications that are set to alert you. However, depending on your settings, some calls may still get through. In the Do Not Disturb settings (Settings → Notifications → Do Not Disturb), you can configure some calls from a specific group of contacts (e.g. your favourites), and repeat calls (a second call within three minutes of the first) to bypass the block.\nDo Not Disturb does not prevent your phone from receiving push notifications or pulling data, it merely silences any alarms about the data. It’s also worth noting that alarms set via the built-in Clock app bypass the DND setting.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina and Dell u3011 video driver problem i have a macbook pro retina with OS X 10.8.4 (12E55) , and i'm connecting it to a dell u3011 monitor using a mini-display to displayport cable , it was working great until today whenever i connect the cable my monitor goes to energy save mode , i thought this was a cable problem so i bought a new one and the problem still remains , i connected to the monitor using HDMI and its working fine , is it a video driver problem?\n\nA: Incredibly late answer, but I had the same issue and what worked for me was to reset the NVRAM. \n", "Q: Switch iPhone 4S's provider I have a iPhone 4S and I dropped it in water and can't talk on it now.

I've heard it's possible. I've already jailbroke it. \nHow can I switch providers?\n\nA: Just exchange the sim card with a \"Bell network\" sim card,\nor go to settings->carrier->automatic->off->and select Bell\n", "Q: Verizon switch to Virgin mobile for iPhone 4 I have an iPhone 4 from Verizon Wireless, but I have never put it on a contract due to high prices of Verizon.  \nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way I could activate it with Virgin Mobile? \n\n*If so, how?\n\n\nA: There are 2 telephone systems in the USA. They are named CDMA and GSM.\nOne with SIM card and the other without SIM card.\nVerizon is without SIM card!\nSo just check with the new provider what system they use and you will know if your phone works.\nMajor carriers Sprint and Verizon networks mainly use Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology, while AT&T and T-Mobile use Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) technology. All of these carriers also support 3G or higher networks. The network plays a big part in the capabilities your phone will have and, to some extent, its performance.\nGSM phones have a SIM card that stores your account information and, if you choose, your phone book. When you switch to a new phone, you can simply remove the card from inside the old phone and insert it into the new one. But you can't use a T-Mobile SIM card in an AT&T phone, or vice versa. Also, GSM phones work more widely across the world than do CDMA models. \nThe good news is:\nIf you have the iPhone 4s\nthe iPhone 4S is a world phone,\" it will support both GSM and CDMA networks. Regardless of your carrier, you can be sure that the micro-SIM slot will be there to accept your GSM micro-SIM cards, as well as any CDMA \"roaming SIM.\"\"\n", "Q: How do I retain my photo edits when opening the files in other apps? I just got back from our first family road trip vacation. I took about 1000 pictures and edited them each night and as we drove to our next location.\nToday, when I tried to open them in other apps, the edits were gone. They still show in the Albums, but when the file is transferred, the original one is sent. All my work was for naught! Unless you know of somehow to have the edits stay? I'm really hoping you know of a fix for the issue. When I tried to look up a fix, I just found sites of others complaining. I'm on the latest iOS (I think is 6.0.3 or something like that). Can you help? :)\n\nA: Assuming you're using iPhoto for iOS (please clarify):\nApplications can only access photos stored in your iOS device's Camera Roll. When you edit a photo in iPhoto (and likely in other, similar applications), the app creates a copy of the photo and stores it within its own storage area, where other apps can't see it. In order to make the edited photos available to other apps, iPhoto lets you export one or more of your Edited photos in a variety of ways: select one or more photos and tap the Share button to see the options, which include sending the photo to your Camera Roll (where other apps can see it) and Open In... which lets you send the photo to a specific app.\nI'll admit, this is somewhat inconvenient when you have a large number of photos, as even when selecting multiple, iPhoto limits you to selecting 100 at a time.\n\nA: Since we do not know what application did you use to do your EDITS, it is difficult to help you.\nUnfortunately there are to many photo applications out there. \nThe problem is that you can make edits in some but the edits are application specific and mostly not transferable to other photo app.\nIn simple terms, when you make an edit in one application, others my not be able to read them, but they are not lost, just have to use the original application.\nTo overcome some of the problem in the future do not use albums, instead use saving a single photo. The reason is the albums are made specific to a photo software and not transferable.\nSo to fix your problem, open the albums in the application you made the edits and save the individual photos.\n", "Q: ls command: What does the @ in file mode mean, and how to get rid of it?

And how do I get rid of it?\n\nA: From the ls manual (man ls) section The Long Format\n\nIf the file or directory has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '@' character.\n\nYou can then display the extended attributes with -@\n\n-@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output.\n\nTo manipulate extended attributes you can use the xattr command.

I am looking into getting a new Macbook Pro (hopefully they'll have late 2013 models). I currently use my early 2011 Macbook for iOS app programming and light graphic design work with Pixelmator. I can't remember when, but I think when I upgraded to Mountain Lion all programs now take a little longer (too long, imo) to launch.\nFor future reference, I was wondering what affects app launch times the most? Is it the processor, RAM or hard drive/SSD? Right now my Macbook's got 2.4Ghz Core 2 Duo, 8GB DDR3 and a 250GB hard drive.\n\nA: The hard drive is the only one that noticeably slows down app launching. \nWith RAM, there's no noticeable difference unless you already have many programs open and running.\nWith CPUs you'll only have one core involved in opening an app, so the differences are tiny even if you're making a large improvement.\nThe payoff with large amounts of RAM and faster CPUs come after the app is open, but mostly that payoff is only seen when you're multitasking or working with large media files.\n\nA: Until the software is loaded in to the RAM it is your Hard drive that is the bottleneck.\nSo using SSD you will gain some speed, but make sure you keep 20% free space on the disk.\nOnce the software is in your RAM it is the combination of the processor (CPU) and the RAM, assuming you have sufficient RAM so not to have to share it with SSD. \nAfter that it is the software it self that slows things down by bad design, bad drivers, or needing lots of other cross functional activity (other programs) to operate.\nYou can find the details of shut down and start up in your\nConsole \n\nvar/log/system.log\n\n\nA: SSD/HD speed will impact boot times of apps the most.\n\nA: I had a MBP with 8 Gig RAM and conventional HD.  After replacing the RAM to 16 I had a minor (if at all) improvement it time lag when opening an application.  I then replaced the HDD with a SSD and the time lag almost disappeared.  So the speed of going to disk to going to RAM seems to be a major issue, and the benefits of a SSD (i.e. a much faster disk) are by a mile the greatest improvement in application loading times.  I did not try to overclock the CPU, but I doubt it would have made a major impact, or any impact comparable of moving to SSD.\n", "Q: Is it possible to block a specific IP from attempting to connect to screen sharing? I have noticed for some time that the shared screen icon flickers on and off on my menubar every couple of minutes (MacBook Pro, MAC OS X 10.8.4). I thought it was a glitch or a bug. I've checked the console and there are connection attempts almost every minute. 99% are from a specific address:\n26/07/13 00:41:51,569 screensharingd[49866]: Authentication: FAILED :: User Name: N/A :: Viewer Address: 89.96.146.134 :: Type: VNC DES\n\nIs this a brute force attack? Should I be concerned? I do need Screen Sharing on, as I connect to this mac quite frequently. I considered activating the Firewall, but it won't help unless I block all incoming connections.\nIs there a way to block that IP from connecting at all. The mac is behind an airport extreme router with VNC ports pointed to this mac by NAT. Any way to filter those connections at that level?\n\nA: If it really is just that one address and no (or few) others and you really don't know a Davide Farci of Verona (that IP address is part of a small subnet assigned to him, small enough to be a personal network or very small office and we'll get back to that shortly) then you can jump through the hoops of setting up a real firewall (e.g. IPTables), either on that system or on your router (the latter is better as it can then take care of other threats).  If that's too much trouble or you really want to do it on that workstation, then I suggest Little Snitch, which can filter both inbound and outbound connections, report on them and, of course, block them (Double Click hasn't managed any traffic to or from this system since I first installed it).  A lot of people use it to stop annoying programs that like to \"phone home\" and report on them.\nAnyway, it's very configurable, very effective and very intuitive.  Recommended for users of all skill levels.\nNow, back to Davide Farci.  It may be that he is launching an attack on your system.  That is certainly possible.  However, it is more likely, without knowing any particulars of your situation, that he is just an ordinary gentleman of Verona whose own system has been compromised.  Either way, you should collect those logs and forward them to the security and/or support department of his upstream network provider (send them to abuse@fastweb.it) and they will educate their customer (either by getting him to fix it or booting him off the network, whichever is most appropriate and probably the former).\nBy the way, all this information is sourced from a whois check on the IP address in your question.

I wound up emailing the opml file to myself, and clicking the attachment in the mail app ... this displayed the raw XML full-screen, with no obvious way to do anything with it (like get Overcast to import it, which is what I ultimately wanted).  Eventually I noticed that if I tapped on the screen, a menu bar appeared at the top of the screen, and it had an \"export\" icon (a square with an arrow pointing up from its center); tapping that showed me a bunch of icons, and I was able to scroll them to reveal Overcast ... which happily imported it.

I'm trying to extract the InstallESD.dmg image so that I can create a USB key any time I want to in the future, to recover/boot my 2011 iMac.  I would think this would be no problem at all, since the machine obviously is authorized to run Lion.\nHowever, every time I try to run the installer in order to retrieve the image (following tutorials such as http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110831105634716&query=lion+usb for example), I am stopped cold by the need to sign into the App Store with my Apple ID.  Apple then checks to see if I've bought Lion - which I have not since it came with the machine - and refuses to let me proceed.\nThis is maddening, does anyone know how to simply and direct extract the InstallESD image from the recovery partition without requiring an App Store login?\nAnd in case anyone mentions it, I do NOT have the installer as downloaded from the app store so I cannot just open the package to get the file - it's not available that way on the recovery partition.\nI should also add that I've tried Lion DiskMaker and while it seems like a great concept, the AppleScript always crashes just before completion, and I don't trust the result.\n\nA: The recommended way to create a recovery partition on an external disk is now to use Apple's Recovery Disk Assistant. It was released after that Mac OS X Hints article and Lion DiskAssistant.\nIf your Mac has firmware support for internet recovery mode (like Macs released after 2010-2011), you won't probably need any external recovery partition. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4718:\n\nIf you happen to encounter a situation in which you cannot start from the Recovery System, such as your hard drive stopped responding or you installed a new hard drive without OS X installed, new Mac models introduced after public availability of OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion automatically use the OS X Internet Recovery feature if the Recovery System (Command-R method above) doesn't work. OS X Internet Recovery lets you start your Mac directly from Apple's servers.\n\n\nA: To get rid of AppStore verification it is possible to create another admin user without AppleID but the original admin password and to try the tutorial with this user. This way Apple won't be able to know either you bought OS or not\n\nA: Right or wrong, many of the answers given here have changed over time, or vary from OS to OS, or depend on the hardware.\nThe 2014 MacBook Pro can boot from the recovery drive and \"recover\" or reinstall the last OS installed. But the recovery partition doesn't contain that OS, your standard boot drive does (or did, in the event it has become corrupted or otherwise readable). If Mac HD has become corrupted, or when opting for a \"clean\" reinstallation (erase & install), internet recovery will reinstall the factory OS that the computer shipped with.\nI know this because I just did a clean install yesterday, and the internet recovery reverted my OS from El Capitan back to Mavericks.  It also took about four hours.  I found this question because I am also looking for a way to build an installer without having to download one on my slow connection.  It should be possible given what I just learned, but if so it wouldn't be on the recovery drive.\n\nA: The Recovery Disk Assistant only replicates the Recovery HD.

Commonly the problem occurs with the process QuickLookSatellite-general, but it is not limited to it. (Please see images below.)\nWhen the QuickLookSatellite-general is the process in question, resetting the Quick Look Manager:\nqlmanage -r\n\n…seems to solve the problem.  Otherwise the problem continues until the application is closed or the process decides to stop.\n\n\nOn Google I found this process is associated with DraftSight, a CAD program. I do not and have never had this program installed.\nRestarting does not even fix this problem.

Also pay attention to what directories you have open at the time your CPU spikes (QL doesn't generate thumbnails for anything other than a directory or file being displayed in the Finder or other application viewing a file list).\nIt will output something like this\n\n[uniform type identifier] -> path (version)\n  [uniform type identifier] -> path (version - loaded)\n\nThe -m flag also accepts several arguments:\n\n\n*\n\n*plugins   Show the generators list (default action)\n\n*server    Show quicklookd life information\n\n*memory    Show quicklookd memory consumption\n\n*burst     Show statistics about the last burst\n\n*threads   Show concurrent accesses stats\n\n*other     Show other information about quicklookd\n\n\nAdditionally, don't bother with man qlmanage as the manual isn't as good as the built-in help found at qlmanage -h.\nIf you want to see if DraftSight has a plugin loaded (or installed), try running qlmange -m plugins | grep -i \"draftsight\".\n\nA: I had the same problem. It was caused because I left open a Finder window with a Search which seem it kept refreshing all the time. \nI just closed that finder tab with the search and the 100% CPU dropped to a normal 3%, and the quicklookd process dissapeared from System monitor's list\n\nA: What I also found helpful was to turn on QuickLook debugging so I could see exactly what files were being processed. You can do that with this in the terminal. More info in the Mac Developer Library.  \ndefaults write -g QLEnableLogging YES\n\nYou can also adjust the debugging level using qlmanage -d debuglevel.

I have Mail as my default client, as when browsing the web / writing mail, I want to send all emails from that account.\nHowever, I use Outlook for work.  When I need to send a new email to someone in outlook, say an email, and their name is blue and highlighted, I click their name. However, it opens a new mail message in Apple Mail instead of Outlook.\nHow can I have Outlook know that if I'm using Outlook, I want to send new messages FROM Outlook?  I hope the question is clear!\n\nA: Setting Default mail Client tells your system to use that one when requesting email from other applications. (outside of Email).\nWhile in Email (Outlook or Mail) they will do as told.\nIn your case using MS Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint with email link in one of the documents, will by default use the chosen default mail client.\nThere is a simple work around.\nSince you are probably not using heavy duty MS Office applications to handle your Mail.app but do so with Outlook, I would make the Outlook the default mail application.\nNow you can use Mail as email and Outlook will be the default mail client for your work.\n\nA: I have had the opportunity to directly ask this question to the Mac Outlook team. The answer is that this is by design. When you click on a hyperlink Outlook doesn't first check to see what kind of link it is. Outlook asks OS X to decide how to open the hyperlink. If some email app other than Outlook is the current default email app then that's what will open the mailto: hyperlink.\n\nA: SImple solution. you need to set your default mail app.  Read here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201607\n", "Q: Can I shorten the typing needed to `cd` into some well know directories I find myself opening a terminal and then CD'ing a lot into the same directory the path of which is very long.\nThis means I am cd'ing a lot and using the tab to speed things up a lot.\nIT would be great if I could have some sort of link to this directory and then just cd to that so that I would be in the deep nested directory quickly.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: I highly recommend fasd which is similar to autojump and z but better IMHO. From the website:\n\nFasd (pronounced similar to \"fast\") is a command-line productivity booster. Fasd offers quick access to files and directories for POSIX shells. It is inspired by tools like autojump, z and v. Fasd keeps track of files and directories you have accessed, so that you can quickly reference them in the command line.\nThe name fasd comes from the default suggested aliases f(files), a(files/directories), s(show/search/select), d(directories).\nFasd ranks files and directories by \"frecency,\" that is, by both \"frequency\" and \"recency.\" The term \"frecency\" was first coined by Mozilla and used in Firefox (link).\n\n\nA: Alternatively you could create an alias.  Throw the following into something like .bashrc or .aliases\nalias shortcut='cd ~/path/to/deep/deep/deep/directory/'\n\nThen make sure that whatever file it is in is sourced.  My aliases are in .bashrc, which I source with this line in .bash_profile:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nA: Here is the way to deal with complex paths to cd frequently.\nmkdir ~/Links\nln -s /complexpath/there ~/Links\n\nthis will create the symbolic link\n~/Links/there\n\nTo use this new Links directory efficiently,\nif your login shell is bash\njust include this command in your ~/.profile (which is used by all Bourne style shells bash, ksh, zsh…):\nCDPATH=~/Links:.\nexport CDPATH\n\nThis means that for every cd, your shell will look within 2 directories to\nfind a localpathname:\n~/Links\n.\n\nYou won't need to restart you session to test it, just run:\n. ~/.profile\n\nwhich means just read my ~/.profile.\n(You won't have to put it in your ~/.bashrc since there is no need to repeat the same variable initialization when you don't change it.)\nOnce you have tested it, you will be able to restart your session ;).\nFrom now on, everytime you will want to go to there you will have to type:\ncd there\n\n\nA: Adding convenience symlinks is fine for a special directory or two, but very quickly it gets to be a pain to manage. A far better solution is to use the environment variable CDPATH, available on bash and other shells for just this purpose.\nCDPATH is a colon-separated list (like PATH) of places to look for a directory name. It can contain both absolute and relative pathnames. I have mine set to something like export CDPATH=\".:..:$HOME/work/repos:$HOME/projects:<etc>\". \nWith this set up, I can type cd pdftools from anywhere and it will take me to ~/projects/pdftools. (With a symlink, I'd have to type cd ~/pdftools if I wasn't in my HOME directory.) I can also shortcut into subdirectories: cd pdftools/bin.\nThe .. in my CDPATH lets me type cd sisterdir instead of cd ../sisterdir, etc. As you can expect, when I create new directories anywhere in CDPATH they'll automatically be found by cd-- no need to create new symlinks or aliases.\nThis feature gets even nicer if you use the bash_completion file distributed, e.g., with Debian systems. It didn't come with my OS X box, so I fetched a copy and it works fine. (Get it with brew, or just download it manually from here.) This file defines enhancements to commandline completion, so that I can type cd pdf<TAB> and the pdftools directory is found and expanded from anywhere on CDPATH.\n\nA: Defining an alias is a very easy way to have a short abbreviation for a longer command. Once you have your aliases right, you could create a section in your .bashrc file (or other startup file) so that you don't have to re-type these aliases for each new shell you start: \nin .bashrc: \nalias ws4='ssh qsv-rhws4'\nalias httpdlog='cd /var/log/httpd/'\nalias EC2='ssh -i BMTestEC2.pem ec2-user@xxxxxxxx.compute.amazonaws.com'\n\netc. \nLog out and back in (or just run . ~/.bashrc) and now you can just type httpdlog and it performs the cd. Or ws4 and it actually performs the ssh command etc. \nThis removes the need to create (a large amount of) empty links that will cause your home directory too look like a mess. \n\nA: Try using either autojump or z.\nAfter installing either of the two, you just cd around like normal and they learn your most visited directories and allows you to go to them by only typing a part of the path:\n$ cd /very/long/path/foobar\n$ cd\n$ z foobar\n$ echo $PWD\n/very/long/path/foobar\n\nI prefer z of the two.\n\nA: Sure: Create a symbolic link\nln -s /some/really/long/path/to/somewhere/ ~/shortcut\ncd ~/shortcut\n\n\nA: I like using bashmarks to easily create \"bookmarks to directories\" on the fly. \nSee the readme at: \nhttps://github.com/huyng/bashmarks\nNote: you'll need git installed in order to follow bashmark's three-step installation process: http://git-scm.com/download/mac\nGood luck!\n\nA: Alternatively you can also try installing fish shell.\nhttp://fishshell.com/\nThis has excellent prediction for commands. It also intelligently lets you type case insensitive without any screw up.\nDownside of fish is that it has its own scripting language and they are not bash compatible.\n\nA: All I do is type \"cd \" and then drag the folder from Finder into the Terminal which pastes in the full path. Perhaps not quite as elegant, but works for all folders vs a few presaved shortcuts?\n", "Q: why login screen has a 2-second delay with external monitor? On a brand new mid-2013 MacBook Air, with an external monitor ASUS PB278Q 27\" 5ms WQHD (2560 x 1440), connected through a miniDP-to-DP cable, every time the computer gets back from the monitor sleep, the login screen has a delay of several seconds, prior to the typing or the updates being reflected.\nThis generally happens about a second or two after MBA's own monitor gets online, and the unresponsiveness continues for a couple of seconds, until the external monitor appears online.\nWhy do I have such a big screen delay on login, and how do I deal with it? \nMy conjecture of the situation is that when my Mac instructs the monitor that it is no longer needed, it enters some kind of power saving mode which seemingly makes it unintentionally treated as a disconnect from the Mac, and then when the Mac wakes the monitors back up, the external monitor is made to appear as a new device, and takes some extra time for configuration / adjustments.  In any event, I'm convinced this should not be happening, but who exactly is to blame, and is there any way to deal with this?\n\nA: A new conjecture is that this is due to a non-compliant mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable that is causing the problem.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS3533\n\nIn certain circumstances you may notice a black screen after waking your computer from sleep. The computer may also appear to be unresponsive when the black screen appears. \n\n\nCertain cables advertised as being VESA 1.1a compliant may contain a construction issue that may result in the DisplayPort power pins at either end of the cable shorting together. VESA 1.1a compliant cables must isolate the DisplayPort power pins at either end of the cable.\n\nSupposedly, this only affects resolutions above 1920x1200, e.g. of the popular resolutions, only 2560x1440 and above are affected.\nThe StarTech mDP to DP cables are not VESA compliant, and very few mDP to DP cables are actually compliant.\nThere's a web-site with a list of compliant cables: \nhttp://www.displayport.org/products-database/?products_category[]=cables-connectors&products_manufacturer=\n\nA: I had the same issue - BUT: I only had this issue with a HP monitor so far. Both a Fujitsu Siemens 19\" screen (1280x1024) and a Dell Inspiron 22\" (1680x1050) did not have this delay when connecting and resuming the Macbook (13\", 2009) from sleep. This was with a DVI cable and Apple's DVI-miniDP adapter.\nWhen I upgraded to a rMBP15 I still had this issue, plus the Macbook would rearrange all windows to the internal screen whenever I put it to sleep (the 13\" MBP didn't), which annoyed the hell out of me. So I swapped the old DVI cable used with my DVI-to-Thunderbolt adapter for a \"proper\" DisplayPort cable (DP-to-MiniDP) and the screen initialization delay has gone from 5..10s (!) to below 2s.\nSo: It might also be a monitor issue. Not just a cable or computer issue.\n", "Q: Connect 2008 black MacBook to 2013 MBA via Thunderbolt / Firewire? I am buying a new MacBook Air soon and am getting ready to transfer all of my data via migration assistant. I know this can run via wifi but that is way too slow. My MacBook has a FireWire port, which was how I transferred my data from my older computer that I no longer use to my currently old MacBook that I will be replacing next week. Does anyone sell a male-male Thunderbolt to Firewire cable, and are the reliable? The Thunderbolt to FireWire adapter that Apple sells is female-male so it won't connect into both ports. It seems to be made more for connecting third-party firewire devices (e.g. cameras, media devices) to newer computers that no longer have firewire ports, only thunderbolt ones. Or in the end should I just give up and connect via USB which will be much slower?\nEither way the point is to connect the computers -- whether I use Migration Assistant or not. If I end up just transferring data manually it's the same issue -- I want the fastest connection between the two computers so the process will finish quickly.\n\nA: What you need is a FireWire 800, according to this post from an Apple discussion board. Monoprice is a great, online retailer that has cables for a really low price. Take a look at the results that I have linked you. Remember, you need the 9 pin to 9 pin cable if you want to connect two Macbook Pro's together.\n", "Q: diagnosing (likely) hardware fault on MBP 15'' (early 2011) Today while I was routinely using my Macbook Pro 15\" from early 2011 (model MacBookPro8,2), running Mavericks DP3, the screen suddenly went all glitchy and distorted and the system locked up. (I just mentioned the OS for the sake of completeness; I have a strong feeling that it's a hardware problem and has nothing to do with the OS.)\nAfter forcing a reboot, I got the gray screen with the Apple logo and the spinner - except the display wasn't quite right: the entire screen was distorted by narrow white horizontal lines running across it. After a while the screen would transition to a purely gray one and the system would be nonresponsive (without ever having reached the login screen). After rebooting several times with the same result, I tried the different startup key sequences. I was able to reach single user mode (CMD + S) where I did fsck and the hard disk seemed to be OK. (FWIW, in text mode, the screen appeared normal.) exiting after the HD check didn't do any good though, and the system hung up again.\nIn the end what appeared to help was pressing the Shift + Control + Option + Power Button key combination (related to resetting the SMC) on the aforementioned pure gray screen, which would cause the system to instantly switch off. (Note that I did it while my system was already running, even though the procedure outlined by Apple requires that it be done while the computer is off.)\nUpon turning on the laptop, the screen looked normal again, and the system booted as usual and I was able to log in. I was able to use my laptop normally for a couple of hours when suddenly the screen went completely red as I watching a video online. Force rebooting led to the same problems again, and I was able to \"fix\" it again, same as before - except this time round it only worked for a few minutes before the problem recurred (this time initiated by the screen turning a pure blue). \nSince then I've only been able to use the system for a few minutes before the problem reoccurs. \nQuestion is, how do I go about diagnosing the problem? (I suspect it might be a problem with the GPU or RAM.) \nI couldn't get into Apple Hardware Test (AHT) even though I tried pressing D during startup. Apparently it's not there for systems running OS X 10.8.4 and above (I read that in one of the Apple docs although I don't have a reference to it this instant.)\nAny help would be appreciated.\nEdit: I should mention that the fix (i.e. the keyboard combination) doesn't always work the first time. I don't really know if pressing that particular combination actually helps at all - maybe it just randomly works after \"turning it off and on again\". \nUpdate: I think the problem is related to the discrete graphics card (The AMD Radeon HD 6750M). I installed a free utility called gfxCardStatus that lets you know whether whether the integrated or discrete graphics chip is being used, and also lets you manually set it to one or the other. As soon as I set it to the discrete chip, the screen when all blue and liney on me, and after I force-rebooted I got all the symptoms of my problem.\nThe great thing about this little utility is that it lets me disable dynamic switching of the graphics chips and set the graphics to use the integrated chip. This means that my laptop should at least be usable until I'm able to get it fixed.\nI'll be Googling on this issue later when I have time - a quick search showed that other people with the same MBP model as mine have also reported problems - but I'm still looking forward to suggestions here. Thanks! \nUpdate 2: I think I was a bit hasty in pinning down the fault on the discrete graphics card. As I just found out, the problem can also be triggered when switching to the integrated graphics card, or may not be triggered at all by switching - I was able to switch between integrated and discrete without problems one time. \nI guess that the most that can be said right now is that the problem is with something in the graphics subsystem, and that it is possibly triggered by the  switching from discrete to integrated graphics and vice versa. \nUpdate 22nd Aug, 2013:\nI took my MBP to an authorized service center where I live currently (in the Middle East) and they diagnosed the GPU as faulty, which is what I (and others here) had suspected. They said they would have to replace the logic board, which would cost the equivalent of over $1000 US. Doesn't seem to be worth it as I can buy an 11\" version of the latest MacBook Air for slightly more. \nUnfortunately, I'm no longer able to successfully apply my previous \"trick\" of force rebooting several times until the display comes up normal; it doesn't work anymore, after trying dozens and dozens of times. I just get the start-up chime, with the faulty display, followed by a blank gray screen.\nIf I boot up in Single User Mode (Command + S), the display begins to run normally, which I suppose is because it uses the integrated graphics card (just my guess). But that's the best I can manage; I'm no longer successful in getting it to boot so I can force the integrated card to be used (via the gfxCardStatus app).\n\nA: Get the original DVD of your MacBook Pro, and boot it with the D key pressed.

I would in any case update the driver for the AMD graphics card.\n\nA: I've been subjected to the same annoying problem with my MBP 15, running mavericks (newly updated)... and it seems the problem is Overheating in the HDD, and the only quick solution is to make the HDD get corrupt by itself with the peak heat it can reach after some time(NOT SAFE AT ALL), and to reboot (not the key combination which even I believed of). The heat actually spreads like a wildfire through the logic board... as Aky was living in Middle East, which is a hot place similar to my hot afternoon crashes, \nI think I've got the solution... First, take care of the top left bottom corner of your MBP to not get hot... Or for a permanent help, replace your HDD with a SDD. pretty cheap than replacing logic board right?... \ntry this tip...\n\nA: thi bis a very common issue amongst Macbook Pros late 2010, mainly early 2011 but also on occasional late 2011 MBP's. I believe it marks the start of Apple trying out new lead-free solder (is it the right term) causing quite an array of problems. the 6750M and another AMD card are often disabled. I also suffer from the WiFi card not working for the same reason. on another note the DVD player doesn't work either.\nIt worked fine to get rid of drivers for the AMD discrete card in Mountain Lion, but then I made the error of installing Mavericks. The routines seem to have changed, so now I'm stuck with a computer that's pretty much disabled.\nUnfortunately Gfx Card Status seems to think I've got a second screen attached (this automatically activates the faulty 6750M discrete card). this prevents me from disabling the discrete graphics card. In system prefs you can sometimes  disable the internal graphics card but not the \"high performance\" discrete one (energy saving prefs).\nI'm still to find a method to disable it.\nThere should be a way but my computer abilities are rudimentary, and scouring the web for solutions hasn't turned up more than endless testimonials without real solutions.

My macbook complained for a long time to change the battery, it was almost death, but I tried to get the most of it. After one year, maybe longer, I got the same behavior as explained in the main question. I tried all kind of startup keys and at first I thought that was the solution because after trying so many times I could boot again successfully, but after a while it happened again. The laptop was getting very hot when not plugged to the current, this was freezing the macbook, sometimes i got the blue lines, other times it just got frozen and I could only hold the power button to reboot.\nAfter some trial-error i realized the problem was happening because of a low voltage in the logic board. When plugged to the current everything worked like a charm, so next step for me is to get a battery replacement.\nHope this helps, cheers !\nEdit 1:\nAfter receiving the new battery the issue persists. Then i found this link https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro..., apparently there is a known video issue for 15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro models manufactured in 2011 and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina models manufactured from Mid 2012 to Early 2013.\nYou can check in the link if your macbook is under the repair extension program and they would fix it for free. Mine does.\n", "Q: Shortcut iPhone/iPad app to send email to a specific address? I send lots of emails to a small number of people.  Rather than having to send emails to them through the native Mail app, I'd like to have an app that I can \"click\" on that automatically has a specific address already filled in and seeks only a subject and message-contents.  \nI'd like to have three of these, each doing the same thing, but going to different email addresses.\nI've never written an iOS app and don't feel like learning how, but I haven't yet found a way to either create forms or encapsulate macros or other paths to doing what I want.  I've tried doing this by navigating to a webmail \"send email\" screen via the Safari browser, filling in the To field, and then saving it as a shortcut, but when clicked on the screen appears without the email.\nAny other ideas?\n\nA: There are at least two apps which support something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drafts\nNote application with the ability to define actions for these notes based on the standard URL scheme. Sending mails to pre-defined addresses is easily possible\n\n*LaunchCenter Pro\nQuick starter for apps, using URLs as well.

This is beyond irritating and I can't find any info.\nThe magsafe connector for my new 13\" retina display MBP is different than the one for my old (12 months) 15\" MBP and is not compatible with the 27\" thunderbolt display.\nI could understand if one were older than the other, but I literally just got the new thunderbolt display and 13\" MBP from Apple yesterday and the magsafe power coming from the display does not fit into the magsafe connector on my notebook.\nWhat gives?\n\nA: Your Thunderbolt monitor has a MagSafe Connector - your MBP has a MagSafe 2 Connector. Apple now supplies a MagSafe to MagSafe 2 converter with the display (check the packaging - the adapter is small). If you are missing the converter, check with Apple - they should give you a replacement.\n", "Q: Why am I not able to expand my hard drive partition after deleting Windows? I'm a MacBook user and I had previously installed Windows on my laptop. \nAfter deleting the Windows partition now, I'm facing difficulty in expanding my hard drive partition to the maximum. After I drag the the partition to Full and click Apply, it shows:\n\nChecking journaled HFS+ volume\n\nThen, a message pops out:\n\nPartition failed with the error : couldn't modify partition map because file system verification failed. \n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the Mac into Single User Mode by holding ⌘ (Command) + S when pressing the power button.\n\n*When the command prompt finally appears, type:\n /sbin/fsck - fy\n\n*After this is completed, type reboot or exit.\n\n*Wait for Mac to start up normally.\n\n*Back in Disk Utility, hit Verify Disk, then try and partition as normal.\n\n\nA: Simply Hold Shift before startup.

I am getting a used Mac Mini primarily so I can record music using Garageband.\nWill the 2007 or 2009 models have enough performance to run the latest Garageband and latest OS X?\nI will at most record three audio tracks simultaneously. For playback probably maximum six audio tracks plus maximum six software instrument tracks.\n\nA: I did some searching and found this (http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20020233-263.html):\n\nAs with all of Apple's new software, iLife '11 requires a Mac with an\n  Intel processor. iLife '11 is also only compatible with Mac OS X\n  10.6.3 or newer (the current version is 10.6.4). Your machine must also have at least 1GB RAM and about 5GB of available disk space\n  (though it is recommended that users retain at least 10 percent of\n  their hard drive space and leave it open).\nA DVD drive is required for installation, and users must have a\n  minimum screen resolution of 1,280 x 768 pixels.\nSome features of iLife '11 require greater minimum specifications.\n  GarageBand \"Learn to Play\" requires a Mac with an Intel Core 2 Duo or\n  better processor. 24-bit recording in GarageBand requires a 24-bit\n  audio interface that works with Mac OS X.\n\nSo I guess I will go for a Mac Mini with at least a Intel Core 2 Duo.\n", "Q: Why is my Mac using so much memory? When I got my Mac Mini with 4GB RAM I thought it would be enough, since on my Windows machines I never hit past 3GB – but I was wrong. So I ordered 16GB of RAM, but one of the sticks was bad, so I have 8GB in one channel and 2GB in the other, totalling to 10GB RAM.\n\nNormally this is more than enough to have a virtual machine open, whilst playing games and doing some heavy work at the same time. Today I finished recording a video and started to encode it on ScreenFlow when I realised it said it would take an hour! It normally takes a few minutes, so I opened up Activity Monitor and saw all of my RAM was being used! \nI never saw that before – I only had ScreenFlow open by itself. After looking at the processes, I noticed there was nothing major hogging up the RAM, so what gives?\nIt's the first time this has happened! I saw a page out since putting the new RAM in as well. Why is everything so slow? This is my first Mac, so I hope I don't have to fiddle around with something like a registry or anything. I am willing to answer any questions and do any tests.\n\nA: \nDont worry about the inactive part, this doesnt mean that your mac\n  will run slow, macintosh keeps these inactive(as IDLE) where when\n  programs needed*-(the ones that you've been using)-* then accessing\n  them would be faster since they are still in a way or another in\n  memory regardless of swapping being in process.\nAnd if your scared of the inactive blue color eating the pie chart\n  displayed, then open your terminal and type: \"purge\" to clear your\n  inactive space.\n\n\nA: Expanding on my comment above:\nSee: apple.stackexchange.com/questions/52013/why-is-it-that-my-mac-would-rather-swap-than-clear-inactive-memory?rq=1  It doesn't actually provide an answer, but it explains what's going on.  I've been having the same problem at least in Mac OS 10.6 and 10.7 (and maybe 10.5). The only \"fix\" I've been able to find is to manually clear the memory cache when this happens.  I know of two ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have the Mac Developer Tools installed, the command flush on the command-line will flush the memory cache and make some (often most) of the inactive memory active.\n\n*The utility cocktail (and probably others) have an option to Purge inactive memory and optimize virtual page usage which seems to have the same effect.\n\n\nI think there's been some debate around this, but personally I don't understand why the memory manager keeps so much inactive memory unavailable while the system starts swapping.\n", "Q: Animated Traveling route in iMovie I like to make a movie from my holidays where I travelled a lot through a country. What I would like to include is an animated traveling route in the Indiana Jones style. That means, you see an old fashioned map with some points for cities on it and then a red line is starting to connect city 1 to your next destination. I would like to do this by a straight line when I travel by plane and an actual path (maybe from a GPS file) when I travel by train. I hope you guys understand what I want!\nIs this somehow possible with iMovie? Or are there any suggestions on how to do this? The build in map solution from iMovie is not what I am searching for since I see no way to customize the map as well as the path - only straight lines are possible, no real paths!\n\nA: I don't think you can do this in iMovie but you could do it as a screen recording in Quicktime Player then import that into iMovie. Open up any paint application, open your map, select a large red paintbrush, start Quicktime Player recording then draw your route in.\n\nA: You cannot do exactly what you want in iMovie, but you can get close. \nYou can put in as many GPS Coordinates as you want to make the path somewhat granular, but you probably would not want to put in all.\nSee my YouTube video for how to add coordinates. It is simple to string together maps in iMovie to make a path by having Map2 use the ending point of Map 1 as the starting point of Map 2 etc.\nThe video is for adding coordinates in iMovie 11. The new iMovie is quite similar.\n\nA: There is some functionality included directly into iMovie for this. You can press Cmd-5 to get a list of possible map clips which you can drag into your movie and configure as usual. The background is not as sophisticated as in the Indiana Jones movies though.\n", "Q: My macbook pro stopped detecting my wireless router (NetGear DG834G) My macbook pro has just stopped detecting my wireless router!\nThe model of the router is NetGear DG834G.\nThe problem is that everyone else in the house has no problem connecting with the network with his laptop or mobile device!\nAny ideas on how to solve that?\nMy operating system is mountain lion.\nThank you.\n\nA: The first step would be to open the folder /System/Library/CoreServices and run Wireless Diagnostics to get to the Utilities window (⌘+2) and run a wireless scan to check on your base station and whether the antenna on the Mac is picking up signals similar to your other devices.\n\nYou'll want to inspect your base station (match the BSSID with the Mac address for your wireless router) and ensure that your signal to noise ratio is better than all of the ones I have shown. Ideally, your RSSI should be greater than -80 dBm: -90 dBm is bad, -60 dBm is OK, and your channel not within 2 of a neighboring station).\nFrom there, you could select performance or run the actual diagnostics or see if perhaps you need to select a channel with less interference.\n\nAs you can see in this view, even with no wireless network connected, you can run the tool. Once you join your network, this performance view will help you getting connected. Once you are connected, you can monitor things here and lastly, use the Info button to see what alternate channels you might try to let your Mac work with your exact router and the competing devices that also interfere with each other.\n\nA: It's possible that the WiFi 'channel' option in your router configuration/administration panel is set to 'Auto' and it went to a channel above 11, which seems to cause a lot of MacBook Pro users a problem - for example, see here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5016957?tstart=0\nSo try changing the WiFi 'channel' to 11 or lower, and see if that helps - seems to have solved my problems!\n\nA: Assuming someone did not reset the router or made it not broadcast its ID, lets try to use the Terminal to display wifi around you.\nOpen Terminal and copy paste this:\nsudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/sbin/airport\n\nyou will be asked to enter your computer password\nafter that copy paste following and watch it work:\nairport -s\n\n\nA: Check your channel. If it's channel 12, it won't be visible, and if you're set to auto switch the channels, it could've picked up 12 on its own. Macbooks only detect 1-11 (just fixed my detect issue by switching the channel).\n", "Q: Sharing and permission How can I set sharing and permission on Mac os x to be -rwx for all?\nWhen I create file or folder it is read and write for me but for all others it is Read only.

I am considering adding an extra drive to my Mac Mini (possibly a tower-size one like mentioned here) and keeping it permanently plugged-in, for extra space and to leave the main Macintosh HD for essential files - system apps, my Adobe apps etc.\nI have a 500GB hard drive, with currently 204.68GB remaining on it, but was considering using the additional drive for the other files I create. I also have a portable drive (SATA) which is NTFS-formatted, but that's used for files I frequently need to carry around - PowerPoint presentations etc.\nOn the additional hard drive, it would be for other things that are less frequently used.\nHowever, what would be the best way to go about this? Also, do applications work well if installed on an external drive - e.g. Quark XPress, MAMP etc. (although I may leave MAMP installed on the Macintosh HD but am not sure whether to move it).\nI have looked up second HD and installation on Google, but what I found was about installing OS X on a second boot drive, not quite what I was looking for!\nMy question is, basically: Will applications run well off a second drive, and is this a good idea before I even do it?\nI'm fairly new to OS X, got better since I started on it in mid-2012, any advice is much appreciated!\n\nA: Mac apps run pretty much anywhere you care to store them.\nUnfortunately, most Mac apps are also so small that the time you spend moving them off the boot drive doesn't compensate for the amount of space you recover.\nYou might look to store things like video and then photos and last music off the main volume as they typically take far more space.\nAs long as you don't have two copies of an app, you are free to quit any app and move it on or off the main volume as you please so other than losing some time, you can start now and see if this plan helps you reach your storage goals or if you need to reexamine them once you've moved all the apps you care to relocate.\n\nA: As mentioned in this post,  it is possible to put the applications in an external drive.  Based on your configuration, you have 240 GB of free space of the 500 GB drive.  one way to take advantage of it is to create a Mac journaled HFS+ system on it, and put all the extra applications on it.  After the applications had been moved over to the external drive, that should free up space of the original drive in the mac mini. \nsee this link and this link on how to create Mac partition in the external drive.  Note: Make sure you backup the files in case of partition failure or making mistakes as you can easily lose data when createing partition.\n", "Q: YouTube upload from iPhone going to wrong YouTube account I have linked YouTube accounts. One is my personal Google+ account: here and the other is my normal YouTube page that I use for business videos, etc. here.\nSince I \"merged\" those accounts, it seems that every video I upload from my iPhone goes to the personal account, not the business account.\nAnybody have any fixes for this, to force the iPhone to upload to a specific YouTube account?\n\nA: YouTube lists the different ways to upload from mobile in this support page. For small uploads, I would suggest uploading by email. G mail limits you to 25 MB. Please verify that your channels have unique email addresses, distinct of each other. \nAnother option is to use the YouTube Capture app which is available on the iTunes store. I do not have an iOS device so I cannot test this method. \n\nA: Fixed this. Required signing out of Google+ app on iPhone then RE-signing in using correct Google+ account. Somehow YouTube camera capture on iPhone is tied to Google+ app on iPhone.\n\nA: try to sign out and log in again that should help. if that doesn't then try emailing youtube to help solve this issue\n", "Q: Viewing preview of files in finder I have some .groovy files on my file system.  I would like to be able to preview them in Finder as I navigate around them.  How do I do this?\n\nA: QLStephen displays files with no extension or with arbitrary extensions as plain text. You can install it by moving the qlgenerator bundle to ~/Library/QuickLook/ and running qlmanage -r.\nIf it doesn't display some file types, try adding their UTIs to CFBundleDocumentTypes:LSContentTypes in the Info.plist.\n\nA: If Finder does not automatically show a preview of a file when using QuickLook (default shortcut key is Space when file is selected), then the QuickLook extension does not support these files.\nUnless you're a hard-core Mac/Unix developer, you won't be able to add this capability yourself. Never fear, however; this is the Internet, after all, and odds are that someone's already developed the plugin for this. A good place to look is the QuickLook Plugins site. \nWherever you get your plugins, installation is very simple. Drag the plugin file (it will look something like a little white Lego brick) to the /Library/QuickLook/ folder, log out, and log back in again. If everything is working properly, you should be able to press Space with your .groovy file selected and see the QuickLook window appear with a preview.\nNotes: You will probably need an admin username/password to modify the /Library/QuickLook/ folder. Also, if QuickLook still doesn't show a preview after logging back in, try restarting your computer.\n", "Q: Change \"reply with message\" text I know how to change text for RELY WITH MESSAGE option, however \n\"Can't talk right now\" part can't be changed in setting. \nIs there an app or a modification that can change \"Can't talk right now\" part? \nTo change text for RELY WITH MESSAGE OPTION go to \n\n\n*\n\n*Settings->Phone->Reply with Message\n\n\nA: If your device is jailbroken, you can use this solution to change the default reply message prefix:\n\niFile will let you edit the .plist strings.

The service I use recommend that I backup just my user folder. Would this be enough to restore my system to it's original if there's something wrong with the computer? I want a backup of all the app settings, including system settings etc not just my documents. \n\nA: To be safe, and assuming bandwidth/storage space is not a big issue, I would recommend backing up everything. A good argument could be made that you don't always need all of it, but unless doing so would cause great inconvenience to you, it will probably be worth it to have the additional security of knowing everything is recoverable. There ARE files outside of just your user directory that even a casual user could find important. Many settings/preferences, application support files, etc. are stored on a higher level than your user directory.\nThat being said, folders outside of your user directory probably do not need to be backed up as frequently as the ones inside it, so you could probably get away just fine with backing up the system folders, say, once a week, while your user directory should be backed up daily.\n", "Q: Unpair apple remote from Apple TV I want to un-pair the silver remote that came with the Apple TV (3rd Gen) so that I can use it exclusively with my Macbook Pro. Is there a way to do that? Please help.\nNote: I have tried using those instructions from Apple, but the Apple TV remote still continues to control the Apple TV.\n\nA: Pair is actually a bit of a misnomer.   Unpaired remotes will still control the device.   Pairing only changes the receiver so that it just looks for the paired remote.  In \"un -Paired\" any remote can control the device.\nIf you have multiple devices that you do not want to interfere with each other pair them to their own remotes and they will not interfere.   If one device is left unpaired it will still follow signals from other remote.\n\nA: From http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1555\n\nTo unpair your Apple TV from a remote\nYou can use any Apple Remote to unpair Apple TV from a remote. Note: If you lose the Apple Remote that you paired with Apple TV, a replacement remote will not work until you unpair Apple TV from the lost remote.\nPress and hold the Menu and Previous/Rewind buttons on a white Apple Remote for 6 seconds, or the Menu and Left buttons on an aluminum Apple Remote for 6 seconds.\nYou can also use these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Choose Settings > General > Remotes from the Apple TV main menu.\n\n\n*Choose Unpair Apple Remote.\nWhen you’ve successfully unpaired a remote, Apple TV displays a broken chainlink symbol () above a picture of a remote.

So, I opened up another file window, but accidentally dragged the Folder1 icon into the Images section in All My Files in the new Finder window. \nNow I can't find the folder anywhere. I even did\nsudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb && locate Folder1\n\nto no avail. It seems to be nowhere.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I've just tried to repeat what you did, the folder ended up in the Documents folder. Instead of using locate it might be easier to use the search functionality included in the Finder directly (or Spotlight) to look for it.\n\nA: All approaches listed so far rely on some sort of database or cache. You may want to search the filesystem itself:\nfind ~ -name Folder1\n\n\nA: As LCC suggested, I would use find.  However I would start in the root of the volume, on the off chance that it ended up somewhere strange outside of your Home directory.\nsudo find / -name Folder1 2>/dev/null\n\nThe 2>/dev/null portion of the command line redirects stderr to /dev/null so you don't get spammed with complaints about devices and directories you don't have permission to access.\n\nA: Spotlight is always the place to start.  It's fast and frequently finds what you're looking for right off the bat.\nUsing Spotlight keywords to narrow the search may make it faster and will improve the accuracy of the search.\nfilename:some_folder_name kind:folder\n\nEven so Spotlight won't always produce the desired result.  For instance system files are not automatically included in Spotlight searches.\nSomeone mentioned the Finder search.  It should be noted that it is just another UI for Spotlight.\nIt's a good idea to have a means to search your hard drive(s) that does not depend upon Spotlight.\nUnix's find utility is very useful, but it has its limitations and isn't all that fast.\nProbably the best free find-utility for the Mac is EasyFind from DEVONTechnologies.  You can download it directly or get it from the App-Store.\nThis utility does not depend upon Spotlight or any index when searching.  It crawls the disk looking for hits and is faster than Unix's find.\nTo my recommendations I would add Find Any File.  At $6.00 U.S. it's a bargain – it's faster than EasyFind – and with a password it will search as root.\nFinally there is File Buddy – the venerable 900lb gorilla of Mac search utilities.  At $39.95 U.S. it's anything but cheap, but it has many features that have kept me upgrading since the early 1990s.\n", "Q: Where to target when doing a Brute Force attack on an extended mac OS drive? I forgot the new password to my external hard drive (Mac OS Extended Journal Encrypted). I know.

I just have no idea what file I'm supposed to tell john the ripper (or any brute force program) to attack. \nMy question: What location do I ask my brute force password cracker to target?\n\nA: John the Ripper is for finding the logon password for user accounts, it doesn't decrypt encrypted drives.\nThere ae tools to decrypt the encrypted drive but they requie the password to be in memory on the host mac system. They are also very expensive.Passware http://www.lostpassword.com apparently have products that can do this.\nhttp://www.esecurityplanet.com/mac-os-security/passware-cracks-apples-filevault-encryption.html\n\nA: There is no file where an encrypted image of your external disk password is stored. Not on the internal disk nor on your external disk.\nYou don't have an encrypted password to feed John the Ripper.\nWhen your external disk is mounted, your external disk password is in memory\nbecause it is heavily used to crypt and decrypt your data.\nIf your external disk is correctly mounted,\nand if you have a FireWire port,\nthen Passware can get this in memory (RAM) password.\nSee here the article from NakedSecurity @ Sophos best describing this technic of RAM searching.

The Time Machine icon had the usual exclamation mark in it for when the backup disk is unavailable.\nHow did Time Machine restore my deleted file, when the backup disk was not available?\n\nA: I believe it is because Time Machine (in 10.7 and 10.7) keep local backups to augment the external drives.\nHe is an Apple support article.\n\"Local snapshots compliment regular Time Machine backups (that are stored on your external disk or Time Capsule), giving you a \"safety net\" for times when you might be away from your external backup disk or Time Capsule and accidentally delete a file.\"\n", "Q: Rebuild SystemUIServer's database I'm not completely sure what happened, but in Console I get the following errors repeating endlessly every few minutes:\n28/07/2013 12:32:10.009 SystemUIServer[304]: Unknown error finalizing or resetting statement (11: database disk image is malformed)\n28/07/2013 12:32:10.009 SystemUIServer[304]: DB Query: begin exclusive transaction\n28/07/2013 12:32:10.018 SystemUIServer[304]: Error calling sqlite3_step (1: cannot commit - no transaction is active) SQLITE_ERROR\n28/07/2013 12:32:10.019 SystemUIServer[304]: DB Query: commit transaction\n28/07/2013 12:32:10.019 SystemUIServer[304]: Unknown error finalizing or resetting statement (1: cannot commit - no transaction is active)\n28/07/2013 12:32:10.019 SystemUIServer[304]: DB Query: commit transaction\n\nIt seems like some database that SystemUIServer uses has become corrupted, and I'm looking for a way to repair it or, more likely, force it to be re-created.

This thread identified the iStat Menus network module as the cause of the problem. Another one blames the CPU module.\n\nA: Step one: Information and Location\nOnce we have found the databse(s) then we can go about fixing it.\nIt might be that one of the SQLite databases has become corrupted. \nIt is difficult to say which one from the information provided by you.\nThe SQLite comes with your Operating System.\nSQLite is a compact, cross platform, self-contained relational database management system that is available in the public domain. SQLite is include in Mac OS X. It is located in /usr/bin directory and called sqlite3.\nUsing SQLite, users can create file-based databases that can be transported across machines, platforms, etc. The only thing needed to then view or edit these databases is the SQLite command line program, or another tool capable of communicating with SQLite.\nSQLite databases can be created by using the sqlite3 program in /usr/bin. To get to this program, you can open up a terminal windows (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal) and then typing the following:\ncd /usr/bin/\n\nsqlite3\n\nYou can exit the command line program by holding the control button and type z.\nYou do not have to do this, it is for information only: Creating and editing databases is cumbersome using the command line program, so a graphical tool like RazorSQL that is capable of communicating with SQLite makes it much easier to manage your SQLite databases.\nYou can search for Databases in use on your computer using spotlight (.)sqlite.\nThis assumes you do not have a Virus (or better check for it) that has damaged your SQLite3.app\n\nA: Could be iStat 4, goto folder /Users/account_name/Library/Application Support/iStat Menus/databases\nMove all files into the Trash and restart iStat/Computer ... should be magic.\n", "Q: keystroke when clicking mouse button I want to assign the middle mouse button to the space key, so I can pan in Photoshop and illustrator without using the keyboard.\nI'm sure something like that must exist for Mac OS, but I only find references to the opposite which is making a click with the keyboard.\n\nA: I found Controller Mate that does exactly what I need, but for some reason it doesn't work in Photoshop or Illustrator.

I figured that since overheating appears to cause this, I should try not to overheat the poor Mac. However, I neither understand why Mac OS X' reaction to overheating is to use 340% of CPU time nor did I manager to keep the lid open and still convince the Airbook to use the Thunderbolt Display as its only display.\nI tried running from battery, assuming this would make the CPU run slower and not overheat, but when I remove the power cable from the Airbook, the Thunderbolt Display just turns black, only recovering after several minutes when I reconnect the power cable.\nWhat's going on?\n\nA: Could you have a look at the 2 main system logs to see what your MacOS may be busy at.\nWith a terminal or an xterm window, the 2 following commands fired when the\nproblem appears may help you diagnose it:\ntail -f /var/log/kernel.log\n\ntail -f /var/log/system.log\n\n\nTo help anyone help you, next time this kind of problem arises, could you run the following command (within a terminal or an xterm window again):\n\ntop -o cpu\n\nand grab a copy of the topmost 10 lines to put them back within your original question as here:\nProcesses: 50 total, 3 running, 47 sleeping, 243 threads                                                                                                                                       12:18:07\nLoad Avg: 1.40, 1.53, 1.28  CPU usage: 5.97% user, 7.14% sys, 86.88% idle    SharedLibs: 5044K resident, 9292K data, 0B linkedit.

It does just display a small point at the center of its looking glass within the menu bar.\nWhen I finally clearly saw what was happening under the hood, I decided to let spotlight finish its job, and one hour later, the temperature, the processors and the fans returned to a normal life.\n\nFinally, since your OS (Mountain Lion) is Lion or more recent, I advise you to read this great explanation on sysdiagnose and if you feel comfortable reading system logs, try it. \n\nA: I am not sure if this is related, but I have been having strange issues on my MacBook with several different various tasks (Specifically QuickLookSatellite-general) using 100+ % CPU Time, obviously making my MacBook unusable like above.  Have you noticed any other processes possibly taking more CPU then normal?  I have been having the hardest time tracking down the source.  Are both problems possibly related?\nHopefully the question I asked might help…\n\nA: This seems to help:\nhttp://blog.viktorpetersson.com/post/100148585299/how-to-fix-kernel-task-cpu-usage-on-yosemite\nI had the same problem when I did a clean install with Yosemite on my Macbook 6.1, but the blog above helped.\n", "Q: Exclude sub-folders from Finder search How can I force Finder to only search the current folder, ignoring the contents of all the sub-folders?\nI don't want to exclude the sub-folders permanently from Spotlight, just for a certain search.\nThe reason I want to do this is that I sometimes have a folder with sub-folders that contain files/folders that are identically named. A simplified example is shown below:\nmain\n|\n|-config.txt\n|\n|-folder 1\n|  |\n|  |-config.txt\n|\n|-folder 2\n   |\n   |-config.txt\n\nWhen I'm in main and hit CMD+F and type config.txt I get three files. I don't want to click every file to see which one is in main and which in another folder, so ideally the sub-folders wouldn't show up in this search.\n\nA: *\n\n*There is a product called Path Finder 6 that offers a feature called \"filters and selections,\" demonstrated here.\n\n*You could try selecting all the items in the folder you are searching and applying a Label, then perform a Spotlight search for your item \"AND\" the additional criteria of \"file label\" by holding down the option key while clicking on the plus sign.\n\nA: Use Unix find as follows\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -name config.txt -print\n\nIn Terminal, type man find for details.\nIf you do this often, you can make it into a shell function.\n\nA: Possible workaround, although this doesn't really answer the question.  Not sure if there's a built-in option for this.\n\n\n*\n\n*In list view, make sure all folders are collapsed --cmd-a (select all) and command-left-arrow are shortcuts for this.\n\n*Without selecting the search box or using cmd-f, begin typing the name of the file \"config.txt\" and this will select that file in your current directory.\n\nA: I´m thinking that if you tag a colour in all folders in a particular location, you can in the search bar type the name of the folder that you are searching and type the colour you tagged, and finder look for only this label colour. So your finder results in not showing subfolders.\n", "Q: How to connect an iPad to a digital projector What do I need in order to connect an iPad to a digital projector?

To see if you have it, find Personal Hotspot. It should be in Settings -> General -> Network -> Cellular Data Network.

I download dozens of PDFs from a research database which all come with the same name (date of download). I have to open the file, select the title, paste it into the filename field, and then go in and manually remove the colon and replace it with a dash.\nThat last part is really what's killing me since basically every file I download has a colon in the title that I want to paste! What I want is something that will modify the contents of my clipboard so I can just paste it into the naming field without having to manually replace the colon.\nIn short, I want any \":\" in my clipboard to change to a \"-\" before I paste it.\n\nA: Try:\nset myText to the clipboard as «class utf8»\nset {TID, text item delimiters} to {text item delimiters, \":\"}\nset myText to text items of myText\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"-\"\nset the clipboard to myText as text\nset text item delimiters to TID\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down\n\n\nA: Actually there is no need for Script.\nAssuming you are opening the PDF files with Adobe Reader!\nCoping the text (titles) containing the (:)\nSelecting Save As and pasting the text.\nAdobe will automatically change the (:) in to (-)\n\nA: While this is obviously an old, already answered question, it appeared as the top 'related' post for a very new question so I took a look at it without considering its age. There are some alternative approaches but I think the easiest would be to take advantage of pdf metadata and use Automator to rename the file accordingly.\nThis workflow takes the selected PDFs, extracts the 'Title' data and then renames the selected files.\n\n*\n\n*Get Selected Finder Items\n\n*Get PDF Metadata\n\n*\n\n*Check only 'Title' in 'Metadata To Extract'\n\n*Uncheck 'Write Input File Name'\n\n\n\n*Get Selected Finder Items\n\n*Rename PDF Documents\n\nNB If the pdf does not have 'title' metadata, then the resulting file name will be — surprise — 'Untitled.pdf'. If your pdf supply has that field data consistently set then it's a non-issue but if otherwise, you could probably construct a 'run applescript' or 'run shell script' action that checks for that value and if it's non-existent, supplies an alternative — for example, by opening the pdf for you to select the title and then copy it to the clipboard and use that.\nAlso, if the 'title' contains a colon, then this will be converted to a '_' or '/' (rather than a hyphen). If there is a fetishistic need for a hyphen, then some additional processing could be done.\nFinally, this could be turned into a Service or a Droplet if that is more convenient.\n", "Q: How can I import text substitutions from Wikipedia \"Lists of common misspellings for machines\"?

Security issue.   If you access the router from OSX it will be in Keychain access.\n\nA: I'm afraid you cannot view the password directly on your iOS device. (See Apple Discussion)\nAllowing you to do that would be a security flaw, as it could make it easy for someone to casually check the wifi password on an iPod or iPhone and then get on the network.

I'm looking for the best method to display a desktop on multiple television displays. Currently I have a Mac Mini mounted behind the tv and controlling via vnc.

(both version X) I've tried out iMovie's stabilization and its not all that great. I was wondering if Final Cut's stabilization was any better or different than iMovie's. I haven't purchased Final Cut Pro which is why I'm asking.\nI also couldn't find anyone directly asking this question after a Google search.\n\nA: Yes, they are different, at least a little bit. I just did a quick test using a rocky beach scene I shot handheld. I tested Final Cut Pro X (v.10.0.6) and iMovie (v.9.0.9) and used their default stabilizer settings (which in iMovie are basically all you have). Looking at the results, FCPX does look a little bit better, but not by a significant amount in my opinion. Where FCPX really makes itself useful is in the ability to adjust parameters of the stabilization. With iMovie, if you don't like what the app did, you're pretty much stuck. With FCPX, you can do more tweaking and testing to help get things right.\nAnother, smaller note: iMovie seems to lock you out of using the app while it is calculating and applying the stabilization, whereas FCPX will do it in the background and will allow you to still work as it computes.\n", "Q: How to tell if a bookmark already exists in Safari (v6.0.5) I find I often wrestle with the implementation of bookmarks in Safari.  Since I care to have my bookmarks simply and cleanly synchronized by iCloud, I continue to use the (inadequate) bookmark features of Safari.  My specific question is: Is there a way to tell if a site is already bookmarked?  I have 1000s of bookmarks, organized by folders.  It seems pretty straightforward for Safari to know when I hit CMD-D to initiate a bookmark that it already exists in my collection.  Am I missing this feature that is already implemented?\n\nA: Safari has a bookmark search function in the top right corner of the bookmark menu window,\nJust paste the new bookmark (or type first 3 letters) in to it and it will tell you if it already exist. \nIt is also useful in finding bookmarks in a very large library.\n\n\nA: Here's a cheeky, long-winded approach with all keyboard shortcuts to copy the URL and search in bookmarks editor: \nTLDR: ⌘L then ⌘C then ⌥⌘B then ⌘F then ⌘V\nWhen done, close bookmark editor: ⌥⌘B\nI'm wondering if there's a good bookmark manager workflow in Alfred that includes deleting (the stock Alfred bookmark feature will search and open bookmarks).\n", "Q: Itunes says \"I do not have enough access privileges for this operation\" how do I fix this? A year or so ago I was mucking around in my privacy and shared settings, trying to make it so my computer was \"secure\" when on a college network.

I remove them manually, which is quite boring. I would like to know if there is any way to block facebook and other sites from being add to Safari's Top Sites. Someone knows how to do that?\nThanks!\n\nA: From Apple's support page: On the Top Sites page, click the Edit button. Then do any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*To specify that a page be kept in Top Sites and not replaced by other pages visited more often, click the pin icon in the page’s upper-left corner.\n\n*To reverse this action, click the pin icon again.\n\n*To specify that a page never be included in Top Sites, click the X in the page’s upper-left corner.\n\n*To display 24, 12, or 6 webpage previews, click Small, Medium, or Large.\n\n*To rearrange the pages, drag them.\n\n\nWhen you finish making changes, click Done.\n\nA: If you know which sites that you want on your Top Sites, you could fill the grid with pinned sites. This way, more sites would not be added since they would not be able to replace pinned sites.\n\n", "Q: My Automator Workflow fails because it fails to find the git command within the 'Run Shell Script' command? Need help I have an Automator workflow and one of the actions is to clone a repository. Here's the code for the 'Run Shell Script' action. The command is run within the Bash shell /bin/bash if that matters:\nSOURCEDIR=\"${3/\\/Volumes/}\"\n\ncd \"$2\"\nREPOURL=\"bob@somedomain.com:$SOURCEDIR\"\nWORKINGDIR=\"$1\"\n\n# Capture any errors with cloning process in log file\ngit clone \"$REPOURL\" \"$WORKINGDIR\" &> ./log.txt\n\n// For debugging\necho \"exit code: $?\"\necho \"PPID: $PPID\"\n\nopen .\n\nNow the Automator App runs fine on my machine. The path to git on my machine (A Macbook Pro) is: /usr/bin/git (I believe I installed git on my machine through Xcode)\nBut on my co-worker's machine (Also a Mac Pro) the Automator App fails. In fact, the output of the log.txt file says: bash: git: command not found \nNow on my co-worker's machine the path to git is: usr/local/git/bin, which, yes, is different because he installed git through the Google Git Installer for Mac OS X, but I didn't think it should matter because in the script the git command is not absolute path to the command and further more my co-worker can run git normally from a Bash script but when invoked directly from the Terminal.\nSo what gives? Why does the automator workflow work for me but not for my co-worker?\nThere must be something fundamental about Bash or Unix that I'm not understanding here but I'm lost.\n\nA: Scripts run via Automator use the default search path which usually does not include /usr/local/bin. In your case an easy fix would be to put\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\nsomewhere at the beginning of the script.\n\nA: I solved the same problem of the same \"service\" workflows being run on differently configured machines by checking what happens when the terminal starts the shell and eventually adding the following snippet to the top of all my \"Run Shell Script\" actions:\nif [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then\n    eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\nfi\nif  [ -f \"$HOME\"/.profile ]; then\n    source \"$HOME\"/.profile\nelif [ -f \"$HOME\"/.bash_profile ]; then\n    source \"$HOME\"/.bash_profile\nelif [ -f \"$HOME\"/.bashrc ]; then\n    source \"$HOME\"/.bashrc\nfi\n\nThis covers all the cases I've encountered so far.\n\nA: If you want the Workflow to work on both machines that have git in different locations, then add each location to the PATH variable that patrix mentioned, separated by a :, as explained here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/AutomatorConcepts/Articles/ShellScriptActions.html\nSo, at the very top of your Workflow Shell Script, you would add:\nPATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin\nexport PATH\n\n\nA: I don't know why any of the other answers were not working for me, but if you use homebrew then put this at the start of the Automator script.\nexport PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH\n\n\nA: For a more general solution to the bash environment in automator differing from your own you could simply load your personal bash profile at the first line of the automator bash script:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nThis will make the path and any other environment variables you're used to using available from your automator script.\n", "Q: Is there anything like the clipboard manager Ditto for Mac? I'm looking for a clipboard manager like Ditto for Mac:\n\nDitto is an extension to the standard windows clipboard. It saves each item placed on the clipboard allowing you access to any of those items at a later time. Ditto allows you to save any type of information that can be put on the clipboard, text, images, html, and custom formats.\n\nMeaning Ditto can store about 40 items. Ditto has some extra utilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*searching in items\n\n*parsing plain text\n\n*keeping images as well\n\n\nA: The one I've found (Maccy) which is available free (yet if you like it, you should donate as well) and exactly like Ditto, simple and focused.\nFor details:\n\n*\n\n*here is the link to it's official site: Maccy.app\n\n*github link: Maccy\nWhile deciding on that one, I've searched and tried a couple others but didn't like as much as Maccy:\n\n*\n\n*flycut\n\n*CopyClip - paid app, but does its job well\n\n*ClipMenu\n\nA: I use Alfred's clipboard history. It's searchable, it can keep history for up to three months, it has a nice keyboard-centered UI, and it doesn't require running other\napplications on the background. It doesn't support images or rich text, but I mostly work with plain text anyway.\n\n\nA: Try this one out: https://github.com/naotaka/ClipMenu. It's free and you could use shortcuts for it.\n\nA: another one is Flycut which still runs perfectly well in OS10.10.3.\n\nA: CopyQ is the alternative I've got for my Macs. It supports richtext, images and has search. You can also change the key combination to show the list and choose what to paste without using mouse.\n\nA: If you just want clipboard history, check out Jumpcut. Manages your clipboard history just fine. To install:\nbrew install jumpcut\n\nIt’s also a common feature in applications like Alfred (as noted by Lauri Ranta), LaunchBar and Keyboard Maestro.\n\nA: iClip is a little old, but still works well. I believe the only thing it doesn't do is search in items. Other than that, it does everything you want and more: images, plaintext, stores up to 99 items, etc.\n\nA: I just started using quicksilver and it seems to some support for images, but I need it mostly for text.  I like that I was able to duplicate Ditto's fast functionality by following this guide.\nThere's a little bit of setup, but looks like I'm going to be sticking with it for my OS X coding purposes. \nPlus it feels good to be back with quicksilver, I remember using it way before spotlight search was any good.\n\nA: CopyClip is available for free in AppStore\n", "Q: Wi-Fi Static Ip on a Macbook-Pro I have a Macbook Pro Mid 2012 with Mountain Lion.

On my desktop I have an extension which prevents websites from reqesting the browser not to recognize the password fields (I imagine they view this feature as unsecure). Now I have synced my passwords with Chrome in iOS, and the extension is not available on iPad. This means that while the \npassword has synced, it does not automatically get entered into the password field. So I thought I would just view the saved password and enter it manually. Unfortunately I am unable to do so. If anyone knows how to either view my passwords or otherwise recover it, I would be most grateful.\n\nA: You can't review your stored Passwords in the Chrome App at all.\nOn the App and in the Support Documents Apple mentions  to use the url passwords.google.com see \nOn that Page when you open it on your Moblie it says that you can access your Passwords From all your Divices but not fron this Site see \nSo i think there is currently no way you can have a Look at your saved Passwords at the Moment.\nIf you realy need it you should Fill a Bug request and send it to Google so they maybe will fix it in the App.\n\nA: As of June 2019 on iOS 12 on an iPad Air 2 (app version 74.0.3729.155) I found the following method to work. I do not own an iPhone, so I can’t comment on whether the same works there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the menu icon (three dots), then  „Settings“. \n\n*Enter the passwords submenu.\n\n*After a short delay, a list of your accounts should be displayed. A search-bar should be located at the top of the dialog. \n\n*For each entry you can view and copy the password, which will prompt for further authentication (TouchID in my case). \nHonestly though, I find that protection too weak. Convenient or not, an account list should never be displayed without explicit authentication. Google seems to still believe that being logged into a device is sufficient authentication, and that nobody ever allows anyone else to access their devices. At least requiring the finger print for accessing the password is an improvement though.\nIf passwords.google.com works for you, you should urgently make sure that passphrase based end-to-end encryption is enabled on your devices with Chrome. Otherwise you may be syncing sensitive data in a form that is accessible on the server side; While using Chrome in itself already puts significant trust into Google as a company, server-accessible synchronization opens up your data to rogue employees or future server breaches.\nAs far as I know, Chrome now by default encrypts passwords with your Google password though, so the website should actually be non-functional for everyone, unless they have implemented client-side decryption in the interface and explicitly prompt for the password. But that would be equally possible with the passphrase, so it probably does not apply.\n\nA: *\n\n*Launch your Google Chrome browser.\n\n*Open the menu with the 'three-dot' button on the far right of the Chrome toolbar.\n\n*Click \"Settings\".\n\n*Scroll down to the bottom and select the \"Advanced\" option at the bottom of the drop-down menu.\n\n*Navigate to the \"Passwords and forms\" feature and click \"Manage passwords\".\n\n*Find the website that you wish to show the password by clicking the \"eye\" icon or you may click the three-dot button to get details about the saved password or remove it.\n\n\nAlso, from the \"Manage passwords\" feature, you can select any account/website that you wish to edit, remove, or update a password for accessing the specific site again.\n\nA: You can now actually view (!) passwords on passwords.google.com on iOS, by tapping the eye icon next to them.\nA word of warning though, in the typical Google fashion they've made a half-assed implementation, complete with the trademark defective and poorly thought through UI. Don't expect to be able to select your entire password if it's longer than, say, 12 characters and happens to contain some sort of punctuation. Copying the password will of course also be out of the question in those cases.\nOh and rotating the device can't be used as a workaround. Also there's no search. Or feedback button.\nThanks Google.\n\nA: You can see them also on passwords.google.com.\n\nA: In Chrome for iOS:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Tap Save Passwords\n\n*There should be a list of all passwords you saved. You can delete then using the edit button or swiping left on the password you want to delete\n\n\nA: View and manage passwords at passwords.google.com\nFrom there sign in to your google account and you will be able to look at all the passwords you have saved. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Current passing through me from Macbook to iMac? I recently bought a UPS for my iMac and it runs just fine.\nHowever, sometimes I also run a MacBook Pro nearby and when I have my hand in contact with the MacBook and reach across to touch the aluminium keyboard attached to my iMac I can feel electricity running through my finger!\nIt doesn't happen when the MacBook is running on battery power, only when it's connected to the mains. It also doesn't happen when the UPS isn't connected.\nThe MacBook Pro is plugged into a standard wall outlet, the iMac is plugged into a UPS and that's in a similar wall outlet (not the same one).\nI'm not very electrically minded, so am puzzled as I'd like to plug the MacBook into the mains again! Does anyone have any ideas as to why it's happening and how I can fix the problem?\n\nA: Usually, ground loop current is experienced on portables where often no ground wire is connected - just the neutral and live (or hot) wires. \n\nIf you are using a grounded plug and feel ground loop current you should either have the outlet serviced or the computer serviced.\nIt's normal (and safe) for ground loop current to exist and feel lightly tingly on Macs with magsafe connectors and only DC power going in to them. It's harder to be sure an iMac or other device that has 110/220 AC power directly into the case, so I would rather be too cautious and have you get an electrician to look at the outlet if your Mac works properly on other outlets or a technician to look at the Mac if it leaks current no matter which receptacle you plug it in to.\nYou might be able to find a grounding issue and solve this yourself, but if you have any doubts as to safety, I'd rather you chose to get expert help rather than trust our guesses based on how things should work.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is grounding important?\n\n*Electricity coming through screws, USB, and headphone jack on 2009 MacBook\n\n*How can I avoid my MacBook Pro giving me minor shocks?\n\n*Is it bad that my MacBook Air is passing me electricity?\nAnd note that all the MacBook questions are low risk situations where any iMac one would be a little more danger (potentially).\n\nA: I would not worry about it.\nThose are blind currents and not dangerous.\nThe UPS is grounded (has 3 pins wall socket)\nYour Mac is not grounded (has 2 pin wall socket)\nThere is always some current leaking to Ground wire, it could be number of places in your household (it could be the toaster ?).\nTo prevent damages in wet areas like bathrooms there is a GFI (ground fault interrupter) circuit there. It is there to save your life if you drop the fan in to the bath tub.\nIf you are concerned then use a GFI to plug your UPS in to.\n", "Q: How to always insert single and double quotes?

How do I enable it so I can change the Apple ID to sign in with?\n\nA: Shane Hsu's answer is correct, but there is also another way to do it if you don't want to delete the app: There is one file for each app that contains the \"receipt\" for that app's previous download from the Mac App Store. The file is named receipt. Here is how to find it and move it to a different location, so that the Mac App Store will allow you to enter a different Apple ID:\nFind the app in your /Applications directory:\n\nRight-click, and choose \"Show Package Contents\":\n\nIn the new window that has opened, double-click the Contents folder to go into that folder.\nYou will now probably see a folder named _MASReceipt. \"MAS\" stands for \"Mac App Store.\" It should have a file inside of it named receipt:\n\nMove the _MASReceipt folder to the trash:\n\nNow, close the Mac App Store and then launch it again. Hopefully, at this point, when you try to update the app, its Apple ID field will be empty.\nIf this doesn't work, you will probably want to put the _MASReceipt folder back, by opening the Trash:\n\n\nA: It is disabled because each app downloaded from App Store has a receipt that links to one specific account.\nAnd that app you wish to update is linked to the account that is already filled in for you.\nIf you wish to update the app with another account (assuming the app is purchased on both account), you will have to first delete the app, and install again.\n\nA: What Mike Morearty said above is correct, but as chepukha said, you do get the This update is not available for this Apple ID either because it was bought by a different user or the item was refunded or cancelled error.\nThe way around this is to do a fresh install. So go into Applications and delete the apps you were having the issues with (in my case I had to delete the receipt file for both Slack and XCode), and then go delete both of those from Applications.\nOnce you do that you can do a fresh install from the App store\n", "Q: SSH on Mac to fresh install of Firefox on 64-bit CentOS 6.4 runs but generates errors: RANDR and GLib-GIO-WARNING I just installed (64 bit) Firefox 18 browser on my Linux CentOS 6.4 server (64 bit).

I'm looking for a hardware solution for a work trip I'm taking soon. The options at the moment seem to be a new Chromebook, or an iPad (which I already have) with bluetooth keyboard. I need a full-sized keyboard (I'll be doing a lot of writing, and Google Drive is an acceptable editor), and a web browser. However, I am not confident that wireless internet in the venue will be as reliable as the wired (ethernet) connection. I would need a USB dongle for the Chromebook; is there a solution to provide a comparable ethernet connection to the iPad? (Comments on this answer suggest no, but I'm curious if anything has changed, or if there's a more general solution than that question asked for.)\n\nA: You could always buy a small router. An Airport Express (or any other cheaper alternative) would do, if you have access to a power socket. \nThere might be devices that don't need to be plugged in, but I don't know any good ones to recommend.\n\nA: Well iPad seems to support Ethernet with this following configuration as report 9to5Mac :\n\n\n*\n\n*Lighting to USB adapter\n\n*Powered USB Hub\n\n*A USB to Ethernet Adapter\n\n*A Ethernet router. \n\n\nA: I have been using Ethernet on the iPad in a commercial setting for a number of years.\nThe solution with the Apple Lightning Camera adapter, a powered USB hub and a USB to Ethernet adapter is very clunky and unfortunately also very unreliable. I've tried this with various combinations of cables, hubs and adapters. Sometimes it would work great, other times it wouldn't work with a message stating that there's not enough power for the accessory. The same setup would work one day, and stop working the next.\nI've found that there are two reliable ways of having an iPad directly connected to Ethernet:\nFirst is to use an iPad Pro with USB-C and any USB-C to Ethernet adapter. This works very reliable for me. You can get USB-C to Ethernet adapters with USB-C PD power pass through that allows you to charge the iPad at the same time.\nThe second way if you have a non-Pro iPad or an early model iPad Pro, is to use one of the ethernet adapters from Redpark. They actually work very reliably, although they are more expansive than a USB-C to Ethernet adapter.\nI have used both the L5-NET as well as their L6-NETAC products. The first is a Lightning to Ethernet cable (with a small block on the cable with the electronics).\nThe second is a small box which is hooked up to a power supply, and uses a micro-USB to Lightning cable for the connection to the iPad. It allows charging the iPad while connected to the Ethernet. It is a bit impractical as a travel companion given that it requires a seperate power brick and takes up more space, but it works well in a fixed scenario.\nIn any case, as long as your iPad is running iOS 10 or newer, these ethernet adapters \"just work\". You plug it into the iPad, and a small blue icon appears in the top status bar indicating that Ethernet is available. In the Settings app, you'll find a new Ethernet menu option that allows you to setup the network connection, if needed.\n\nA: More recently, I've done this with numerous iOS devices like this:\n\n*\n\n*Apple lightning camera adapter attached to the device. This is a gizmo with a lightning plug and then sockets for lightning and USB plugs.\n\n*A powered lightning cable plugged into the lightning socket of the camera adapter. Can be plugged into a computer or a wall socket, but it has to be something that would charge the device if you plugged it straight in.

The camera adapter doesn't seem to be compatible with most 3rd-party USB Ethernet adapters.\n\n*...and then the Cat-5 plugged in to the adapter.\n\nIt's quite an assembly, and it's tedious to troubleshoot, but it was reliable enough that for a while we had four of these setups going in our house.\n", "Q: How to run Xquartz in rootless mode?

I did pretty much everything the official website says, but it isn't working at all.\nFirst of all, I downloaded the installer for Mac OS X 6 and later, which should supposedly put a folder called MacPython 3.3 with IDLE, PythonLauncher and a Build Applet tool in my Applications folder. What I have instead is a folder called Python 3.3 which does contain (aside from the documentation and a command to update shell profile) IDLE and PythonLauncher, but no Build Applet tool; I typed 'python' into my Terminal window to see if 3.3.2 was installed, but it said Python 2.6.1 even after restarting my computer. The ReadMe in the disk image that contains the installer says running the installer should also 'put the underlying machinery into the folder /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework'. I did every search imaginable and apparently there is no such folder anywhere in my hard drive.\nBasically, I want to install 3.3.2 and run things in programme mode rather than shell mode, which I find to be a huge pain in the bottom. Any help is greatly appreciated.\nEDIT: found the Frameworks folder. Python.framework contains 4 folders named 2.3, 2.5, 2.6 and Current, which has several other folders inside – all for Python 2.6. The official page says I shouldn't delete any of them because they already come with Mac. How do I put 3.3 here?\n\nA: So your Mac is still looking for an old version of Python. You need to inform it that there is in fact a new version and where it can find it. To do this, you need to update the PATH to Python.\nThis can be done in your .bash_profile file.\n# Setting PATH for Python 3.3.2.\n# The original version is saved in .profile.pysave.\nPATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3.2/bin:${PATH}\"\nexport PATH\n\nAfter you update the .bash_profile file Terminal should run the new version of Python, when you ask for it.\n", "Q: Mail.app keeps asking for Google password I've a Google account set up on a Mac of mine. OS X version 10.8.4 and everything else is up-to-date. And my Google account uses 2-step authentication.\nI'm having a problem with my Google account on this Mac in the native Mail app. The problem is that when everything was working fine, one day, all of a sudden Mail asked for my Google password. I simply created a new application specific password. But after some time the same happened again and I ended up creating another application specific password.\nNow it's happening again and it's kind of getting annoying.\nWhy does it keep asking for passwords when the one before was right and working? Has anyone else ever had this problem?\nAlso I should mention that my iCloud account, also set up on this Mac, functions perfectly.\n\nA: If you have several devices accessing your Google account via IMAP you can reach the limit of connections Google permits. The limit is 15 connections per account, however, bear in mind that each client can open multiple connections. In my experience the limit is easily reached with 3 devices. I have read that the Thunderbird email client has a setting to specify how many connections it can open, Mail and Outlook do not have this option.\nYour Mail client should prompt you with a message along the lines of \"Too many simultaneous connections.\" However I believe on iOS devices and Apple Mail you may see a more generic error. \nThe workaround for this issue is to log in to the GMail web interface, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the 'Details' link.

The AEBS plugged in via wire to the cable modem.\nI want to set up internet sharing on the Lion using its 801.11n wireless connection.\nI set up the Lion and get the grey up-arrow, no problem. Except as soon as it launches, then the Lion loses internet access. I assume this is because I have defacto created two DHCP servers.\nSo want I think will solve it is to stop the Lion from requesting an address from AEBS. E.g. manually assign it to 10.0.1.2.\nI must be doing something dumb here though, because once I set to a manual IP address then the AEBS is refusing to let me access the internet. What settings should be on it (subnet masks, etc). I'd still like the AEBS to provide DNS, etc.\nI have not purchase the OS X Server software but am happy to do so if needed.\n\nA: Ok, got it.

Not sure why.\nNot as clean as running a single 11n everywhere, however, and the BoxWithNoWireless is going to be running Netflix, etc, so I was really hoping to get 11n. But this at least gets me up-and-running.\n", "Q: View the current clock Speed of a CPU in OS X?

For the past year I have had my old appleid that I used with my own personal IOS developer portal account at Apple. Recently I joined a new company and want to get onto their developer program. When I joined the company, I received a new Mac and I used my old AppleID to install XCode. In other words, now my Mac only knows about my old AppledID.\nSince I now want to join my new company's IOS developer account at Apple, I have two choices: either continue to use my old AppleID (still associated with my personal IOS dev acctount) or create a new AppleID (using my new work email).\nIf I use my old AppleID, how does Apple know which dev account I want when I log in? Will this cause problems?\nOr if I create and use a new AppleID, will XCode stop working for me (since it was downloaded using the old AppleID)? What would I have to do to fix the problem? Which route is easier?\n\nA: You can log in to iTunes with multiple Apple ID accounts. In my case I have a personal account and a work account with dev access.\nOnce the xcode (or any app) is installed it doesn't case who's Apple ID is logged in, however you may have to do some bouncing between accounts if you have installed apps from both accounts and you need to update them. other then that two accounts works fine.\n", "Q: Simple text editor that supports highlighting and font colours I'm looking for a standalone (or web) application that allows for very simple text editing, but also allows for personal annotation of the text by changing script colour and highlighting. Most text editors for developers doesn't allow for the above features, and Word/Pages is much too cumbersome. I'll be using it for some coding but it's primary use will be for DNA analysis (hence the annotation).\nDoes such an app exist?\n\nA: TextEdit is part of Mac OS X. You can find it in the Applications folder.\n\nA: Use TextWranger. It's full of features (including syntax highlighting) and best of all it's free.\n\nA: I'd vote for either TextWrangler (as has already been done) or TextMate. Both are terrific, but I love the TextMate UI, and I love even more that it's free and open source now.\n\nA: Unless you want to use some sort of comments to annotate your files you will have trouble finding such an editor. By definition all source code files are just text and preferably ASCII. Annotated documents, such as RTF contain information which is not displayed to the user and serves to define things such as text color and highlights. \nThus, use a text editor with highlighting for coding (SublimeText, TextWrangler, Fraise come in mind) and use a RTF editor for text which you want to annotate. For this an easy solution is TextEdit which comes bundled with OSX.\n\nA: I was hoping I would get a better answer than what you got, because I'm looking for the same thing. Anyway, I'll contribute my solution because it's closer to bridging that plain-text/rich-text divide.\nI'm using SubEthaEdit, turn on \"Show Modifications\" and then clear all modifications. This highlights what I change, so I can delete+undo a word or line to highlight something. In this app you can save as text or a Subetha document, depending on whether you want to save the highlights but mine are almost always transitory. I like it because I can open a straight text document (source code or a log file) and immediately start making highlights without needing to convert to RTF first. It's also got spectacular regex support (and I've even used the headline feature: collaborative editing, but not for a while). Alas, you can't annotate non-distructively or use multiple colors or anything.\nIt's also not free, but even with all those caveats I mentioned, it has saved me many times and was worth the money. I'll keep buying things until I find the one!\n", "Q: Is delegation of a calendar possible on using Office 365 and any client whatsoever on Mac? I am looking for any way for OS X users to use Office 365's exchange calendaring service to delegate / share a calendar with another user on Office 365.\nI have researched the MS knowledge base which states that for delegation, you need both an Exchange server (which I presume Office 365 is) and either Outlook 2010 or 2013 - neither of which run on OS X.

I have a MacBook pro that I got about 10 months ago. It seems like I am already starting to experience battery life issues. I have a charge cycle history of less than once a day since I bought it. I first thought it was too much stuff running in the background, so I put a fresh copy of Ubuntu on it to test that out. It still seems to have a bad life. At full charge, 50% brightness, the battery says 3 hours remaining, but then after a few minutes, it goes to 2 and I get an average of about 2.5 hours. I have appleCare. Is there a problem, or is time just going faster for me and the battery is normally like this? I think the battery said it usually has a good 5 years, and it hasn't been 1 for me. The battery indicator on status bar also never says 100%, and is usually stuck at 95-99 when the green light indicates full. Is this normal? Or do I have a bad battery? Is there a way to test my battery properly?\nHere is what the power stats say\n\n\nA: There is detailed information available about your battery.\nClick on Apple (top left)\n\nAbout This Mac\nMore Info\nSystem Report\nPower\n\nIn the Health information it shows how many cycles you had so far.\nI have 142 cycles since Oct. 2012.\nThe battery should last about 1000 cycles.\nIf you have a problem please see Apple service.\n\nAbove you see some comparison data (from my MBA)\nRunning @ 100% brightness, Mail, Firefox, Chrome, WIFI and more, consuming about 1200 mA.\nUnfortunately Apple does not show the remaining life as time, so you have to use a formula to calculate that, but it varies based on usage (mA).\n", "Q: Won't turn on after dead battery I have mountain lion on MacBook pro mid 2012.\nSo if my battery dies, because I left noSleep on or just because of being sat untouched for a week off of 2%, when I turn my computer on, Instead of the picture of the screen last used with the loading bar under it, the apple logo with the loading bar. I let it sit for a while, and it stays at the last bar of the loading thing. I wait and wait and nothing. I have to reboot using the power button to get it to work. A message then appears that said \"your computer shut down cuz of a problem\" . I have always saved my work\n, but I am assuming it would all be deleted if I had an unsaved word doc on low battery.\nWhat is going on?\nThings I have tried:\n reset SMC\nReinstall OS on network recovery \nAnd eventually if I have to, I guesss I will have to factory reset it\n\nA: This sounds like a defective hardware issue. Take your Mac to an authorized Apple repair/service center, or an Apple Store, and have them diagnose the problem. If it is under warranty, or if you purchased AppleCare to extend the warranty, they will replace any faulty components.\n\nA: In my opinion this sounds like a missing or corrupt sleep image.\nWhen your Mac loses power thanks to the battery draining it should enter Safe Sleep.  Safe sleep relies on a functioning sleep image to store the contents of memory once power is lost.  This sleep image is located at /private/var/vm/sleepimage.\nI'm not familiar enough with noSleep to know if it removes/prevents this image but it wouldn't surprise me if this was the case since it's main function is to prevent the Mac from sleeping.\n\nMy first plan of action would be to remove the current sleep image using this command in terminal, you will be prompted to enter your admin password once you enter the command:\nsudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nFollowing that command I would restart the Mac using  > Restart... \nOnce the Mac restarts I would use the following command in terminal to check the size of the sleep image, it will likely be the same size as the amount of installed RAM in the Mac:\nls -lh /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\n\nIf for whatever reason either command returns an error then your sleep image likely doesn't exist, which would explain the problem.  If this is the case then I would either uninstall noSleep or contact someone involved with the development (I believe it's open source) to ask about a change in it's behavior or a possible fix.\nHopefully that helps!\n", "Q: Does ios7 support third-party software keyboards? I am a litte confused about iOS 7. Does iOS 7 support third-party software keyboards? There are a lot of rumors around, I watched the last WWDC and read Apple documents but I couldn't hear anything about this. Am I missing something?\nIs this a feature in the new OS?\n\nA: Whether they were removed after an App Store rules update I don't know, but one of the first apps I ever downloaded was a 3rd party keyboard called Swype.  The difference between it (& others that were or may still be around) is that it cannot be plugged in in the same way as on Android, and become the default keyboard for all text input system wide, and instead runs as a standalone app that you can use to type stuff, then copy, then paste into wherever you want it to go using the normal iOS keyboard.\nIn addition, many apps augment the standard keyboard with a customised top row, made to look like it's part of the keyboard when in fact it's just an extra bit within the app, rather than on the keyboard - these are typically used to allow for extra keyboard functions like word left/right, or to provide quick access to common symbols like # or @ etc.\nNo formal announcement has been made about an official replacement API, and I would not expect to see one any time soon, as it goes against the whole \"tinker proof\" direction that iOS has always walked.\n\nA: As of now, no.

I am working with a large excel spreadsheet and I need to delete all the rows that are completely blank.\nI do not want to delete rows or cells with any information in any of the columns.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: If you only want to delete rows that are completely empty, the easiest way I've found is to use a filter.  Highlight all of the columns that you want to include and then click the filter button.  Uncheck \"select all\", and then scroll to the very bottom and click to check the box for blanks.  This will show only your blank rows.  Highlight all and right-click a row and select delete.  This deleted all your blank rows.  Now turn off the filter and viola, no blank rows!\n\nA: What I am assuming is that you have a large worksheet with gaps you need to close up, and that a simple sort would disrupt the order of your data.\nHere's how I would do it: First add two new temporary columns, new A and new B. Select the range of cells in A from the first all the way to the last row you know has data. Use Edit > Fill > Series > Linear and number them from 1 to whatever.\nIn the next column select the first cell and enter a formula that checks to see if the cells to its right are empty. It could be as simple as adding them all up (=SUM(C1:K1)) to see if they are zero or it could be a function of logic (=AND(ISBLANK(C1), ISBLANK(D1)), etc.). Copy and paste this formula down all the cells in column B to the end of your range.\nNow you have two keys with which to sort your worksheet. Sort on column B to find your empty rows and delete them en masse, then restore your worksheet's original sort order by sorting on the first column.\n\nA: insert a new column and count blank cells in a row: =COUNTBLANK(C8:R8)\nuse this to pull down to all interested rows. \nsay you are looking at 20 columns.. then whatever row gets 20 blank cells is a row to delete.

Other users are invisible to the OD master's Server App. Workgroup Manager can access all the users while Server App can't. Viewing permissions through the Server 2003 interface, it seems like the permissions of an invisible user and a visible one are same. I ran SetACL on the directories of the two users and it found no difference.\nHow can I figure out the difference in the accounts/files that makes certain users invisible to Server App? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Our AD has 1000+ users. As it turns out, Server App could see all the users. It was hard to realize this for a couple of reasons: When viewing \"Users from MyDomain\", if I typed in a user's name, Server App would not recognize it. This behavior still occurs. It's only when I search under \"All Users\" that the name is recognized and labeled as a \"User from MyDomain\". I realized that Server App did recognize the account when I made a Local Network Group and tried adding a user to the group. When I typed in the same user's name (invisible when viewing Users), Server App recognized the account. This whole issue is just the Server App behavior on Mountain Lion and accounts on a Windows Server 2003 AD server.\n", "Q: Problem migrating mailboxes to Mountain Lion I have just set up a new mac and migrated the user accounts from the old system (Snow Leopard) to the new one (Mountain Lion) and everything went well except for some parts of the Mail setup.\nIn the old computer there were several mailbox (.mbox) directories on the Mac itself.  These mailboxes were transferred to the new computer and it looks like they were successfully processed by the migration into a new directory structure.\nHowever the mailboxes do not show up in the new Mail program.\n(Note that the mbox's directly related to the email POP accounts did successfully transfer to the new mac)\nFor example, there is a mailbox called Travel and for a particular email message it is located in the old and new systems as:\n/Users/oldmac/Library/Mail/Mailboxes/Travel.mbox/Messages/24307.emlx\n/Users/newmac/Library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes/Travel.mbox/A24F8F9F-8AEC-4802-9FF9-10A497A5352D/Data/4/2/Messages/24307.emlx\n\nAnd the text in 24307.emlx in the new location matches that of the old location.\nSo the question is how do I get these local mbox folders to appear in the Mail app?  Do I have to manually configure something under the hood, or is there a user configuration somewhere that I have missed?\n\nA: Have you tried doing like this?\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to: Macintosh HD → Users → Your User Folder → Library.\n\n*Now you need to copy the Mail folder, as shown below. (Yes, the entire folder.)\n\n*You should also copy the preferences file for Mail.app. Here's where you can find it: Macintosh HD → Users → Your User Folder → Library → Preferences. The name of the file is com.apple.mail.plist.\n\n*Copy the Mail folder and the preferences file to the Library and Preferences folder. Make sure that the folder and file are in the correct location!\nSource: \nhttp://www.macinstruct.com/node/183\n\nA: OK .. I solved my problem and it is a combination of face palm plus a generous serving of hating Apple.\nThis was what I was seeing in the Mail app after the migration, and there was nothing I could see in the preferences that would tell me how to display the files that I knew were in the correct location.\n\nThen by total fluke I moused over the \"On My Mac\" label and saw:\n\nWhich revealed the hidden setting which I can't even see mentioned in the help file.  When I click on Show I finally see what I have been looking for:\n\nMaybe its a pebkac error for not memorising 100% of the Mail apps features, but Apple sure doesn't make it an obvious UI element or mention it anywhere I can find.\n", "Q: Gmail App on iOS shows badge count for unread Chats At times, the Gmail app for iOS can display a hard-to-remove badge. The badge corresponds to a gchat message that was received offline. The badge is considered difficult to remove due to a series of facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*gchat sends an 'email' to your Gmail when you receive an offline message\n\n*gchat messages do not show up in any inbox in the Gmail app; they're only visible in the browser\n\n*The \"Chats\" label does not show up in the side bar of the Gmail app, so there is no easy way to access the chats\n\n*Searching for \"label:chats\" only finds chats up to June 7th. Maybe they released an update then that stopped sending chats to iOS devices?\n\n*Being online 24/7 (for instance, using the Hangouts app) is not a good solution, as I do not want to be online 24/7.\n\n\nThe question is: is there any way to make this badge less annoying?\nPossibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you make the Chats label appear in the iOS app?\n\n*Can you make chats not send emails when you're offline?\n\n*Can you make chats received offline not count as unread?\n\n\nMy \"Notifications\" setting is set to \"Primary Only.\" This affects both my iPhone and iPad.\n\nA: Inbox by Gmail solves this annoying issue! I've switched over my personal email accounts, and haven't had any problems since.\n", "Q: Does a mac support UAS (USB Attached SCSI)? Does a mac with USB 3.0 support UAS (USB Attached SCSI)? If it does, how can we enable it in OS X and bootcamp? I need better speeds for my external RAID.\n\nA: Apparently what you need is already in Lion see this blog OSX Mountain Lion 10.8 UAS UASP USB Attach SCSI drivers\nNote I have nothing to do with the blog.  It was at the top of the list when I googled USB Attached SCSI OSX\n", "Q: How do I know what to restore from system files? I gave my old MacBook Pro to my partner. Before doing so I deleted myself as the User, created her as User, deleted all of my docs & iPhoto Library. Unfortunately, the computer still thinks I am the User. For example, it tries to access MY iCloud content & asks for MY Apple ID. I've decided to replace the hard drive with a larger capacity one. I use Backblaze for backing up the laptop. If I do a clean install of Mountain Lion & then restore only docs & iPhoto Library from the backup, will that solve the double identity problem?\n\nA: The erase (or the clean install of the OS) will ensure that only the new user is created. From that point, you can keep track of which files you restore in the unlikely case you feel things have become mixed again - but it's hard to see if you only restored a iPhoto library folder and files in documents how any user identity would be changed on the OS level.\n", "Q: How is the battery life on the new iPod Touch G5s? I had an iPod Touch G4 and the battery life was terrible.  Has there been any improvement in this area with the G5s?\n\nA: Based on the Technical Specifications (5G, 4G) no big change is apparent, as the only difference between them is the lasting time while playing videos, as it's up to 8 hours (when fully charged) for the 5G while the 4G's is 7 hours.\nThey both share the following battery specifications:\n\nBuilt-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery.\nMusic playback time: Up to 40 hours when fully charged.\nCharging times: Fast charge in about 2 hours (80% capacity), full charge in about 4 hours.\n\n\nA: I've owned both, and the battery life in the 5th generation is much better. In Ars Technica's review they find that the iPod Touch will last about 7 and a half hours while being actively used (in their test they were browsing the web, streaming Spotify and Netflix, and playing some games).\n", "Q: Why is OS X able to send out email without first configuring SMTP? When I try the command in terminal, an email is sent. I have checked there is no local SMTP is running, so what is the mechanism used by Apple behind the scene?\necho \"Hello\" | mail -s \"Test\" foo@bar.com\n\n\nA: SMTP daemons or servers are there to receive mail, not send it.  In your example, mail is purely an email client, and it connects to whatever server is defined by the appropriate DNS MX record of bar.com, and has no requirement for a local server to be running in order to do so.\nHowever, depending on your mail setup, you may require to log into an outgoing mailserver to authenticate, or if nothing else just to provide sender and return-to addresses etc.  Now, you can do all this at the command line by passing the appropriate parameters on the terminal, but as long as you have set up your Mail app, this config is already stored,  and by simply temporarily firing up the mail subsystem the terminal commands can grab that info and now have one or more mail smtp servers they can choose to send outgoing messages. It will then terminate the processes when complete.\nYou can test this all out at the command line and send the mail without having to use a mail client.  I'm not at a Mac, so these commands may need editing by someone who is, but you can do this:\nnslookup\nset type=mx\nbar.com\nexit\n\ntelnet MXServer 25 (where MXServer is one of the results returned above and 25 is the port number for SMTP servers)\n\nRead This for more info on emailing via telnet - it's a great debugging tool\n\nA: mail on OS X does actually seem to spawn Postfix long enough to deal with the mail, then tear it down a short time later.\nTo see this in action, try telnet localhost 25 before the mail command, then immediately after, then wait 5 minutes and try it again.\nI am not sure this is actually a proper answer to the question because it doesn't explain how Postfix is spawned and torn down, but hopefully it helps answer the question.\n\nA: I think mail always uses local sendmail to send mails. At OSX sendmail is postfix. And it is definitely used.\nYou can check the mail headers Received: by [Your-Mac] (Postfix, from userid ....\nNevertheless it is not a good idea to use mail (or better postfix) like this. Best practice would be to use a Smart Host for your local Postfix to avoid often used firewall restrictions.\nYou can find a solution at SMTP Smart Host Setup for Postfix in Snow Leopard which works for me (also on Lion, Mountain Lion).\n", "Q: Data exchange from old to new iphone How to transfer apps and its data from one iphone to another through hard disk? Since I am changing my laptop. \nI want to know whether the backup includes app data also? What i mean is when i restore the new phone with the backup, all the apps would get restored on it even if it is another laptop not the one in which the old iphone backup was taken?\n\nA: All you need is the location of the iPhone backup and it's easy to restore your new iPhone from the backup. Here are the locations for different operating systems:\nMac: (user)/library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\nWindows Vista/7: \\Users\\(user name)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\nWindows XP: \\Documents and Settings\\(user name)\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\\n\n", "Q: Microsoft Publisher: Mac Equivalent? Microsoft Publisher is an excellent piece of software on Windows. Does a Mac equivalent of Microsoft Publisher exist in its own entity ?\n\nA: What exactly are you trying to create?\nYou may be going to great expense and, yet be able to accomplish what you need with Pages. Pages is available on the Mac App Store and quite robust.\n\nA: If you want a full list of Publisher alternatives for Mac, this may be helpful.  I've seen Apple Pages produce some nice documents though it may be more simplistic than Publisher in many respects.\nIf you are open to a web-based option, our product Lucidpress may serve you well since you can use it on any platform.\n\nA: I'm going to vote for QuarkXpress as a replacement for Publisher. Serious pros either use InDesign or QuarkXpress, and the latter has the advantage of not requiring a subscription fee, as Adobe products do. It's not as cheap as iStudio Publisher, but it's much more feature-rich. As they say, you get what you pay for.\n\nA: You can open Publisher files on Mac using a conversion tool and then convert the .pub file to PDF and open it that way. MS Word also has a Publishing Layout View function which is similar to Publisher. However, for the best alternative, I think Pages does a pretty god job although it's more like Word. For Pros, go with Adobe InDesign. This is a pretty good article on alternatives to Publisher on Mac too.\n\nA: A suitable alternative maybe seen in iStudio Publisher, an easy-to-use page layout application for desktop publishing on Mac, allowing the creation of professional quality documents with ease, including newsletters, brochures, adverts to name but a few.\nVideo tutorials & a rapid start guide also aid novices to the most experienced of users. \nIt is considered an excellent resource for those who bemoan the fact that MS Publisher is not available on the Mac platform.\nFrom Apple's App store it is $17.99. Purchasing directly from the website above however gives a 30 day free trial period.\n\nA: No one has pointed out here that although there is no version of Publisher for Mac, some of the functionality of Publisher is available in Word for Mac by selecting the \"Publishing Layout View\". However, it is nowhere near as functional as Publisher and you're definitely better-off using one of the many excellent Publisher alternatives on Mac particularly InDesign or Quark.\n\nA: The Best option is definitely InDesign. But it's also probably the most expensive one. \nIt's the reference in Desktop publishing software. \nAdditional information:\nAdobe InDesign is available for Windows and Macintosh. It is a high-end industry standard program used by the publishing industry for producing all kinds of documents up to and including internationally-renowned newspapers and magazines. At this time it is only available by a $50 per month subscription to Adobe's Creative Cloud service. Needless to say, it is much more powerful and advanced than Microsoft Publisher, which is designed for low-end office and small-business newsletter production.\n\nA: If you want to write try Apache OpenOffice.\n\nA: You may also try Swift Publisher from BeLight Software, available in Mac App Store or from their web site (a free trial is available).\n", "Q: usb mouse freeze on mid 2007 macbook with lion 10.7.5 installed I bought a mid 2007 white MacBook used with Lion 10.7.5 installed. My usb mouse freezes after using it for about an hour plugged in. I tried both usb ports and the mouse will work for about a min. but then freezes again. Could it be a driver issue? If so where would I download the drivers?\nThe mouse works perfect on my W8 computer.\n\nA: The first thing to do is to try another USB mouse, perhaps a different make and model, and see if it also locks up on your Mac. If so, then it's pretty certain that your first mouse is defective or incompatible with Lion for some reason. If several mice lock up, then perhaps there is something wrong with the USB controller on the motherboard of the MacBook. But it is much more likely that the fault is with the mouse.\n", "Q: Hide creation date of a file I've failed to produce a document in time - if I send it, the receiver will be able to see the creation and last modification dates.\nThis is what happens whenever I download files from the web or an usb stick/hard disk: I'm always able to see these metadata.\nSo, where are these data stored? In the file? What then if I create a text only file: why am I still able to see the creation date?\nHow can I hide this information NOT from the Finder but from the document itself?\nThanks!\n\nA: I would suggest that just hiding the date is not going to convince anyone, since it is normal to find the dates where they supposed to be. \nIf there is no date one will be very suspicious.\nWhat you have to do is to modify the date so that it looks the way you want it.\nFirst learn where the information is stored.\nLets say you are using MS word documents.\nUnder File click on properties > statistics (you will see the dates).\nThis part is fun, but do not screw it up.\nGo to your system preferences and change the date that will become your \n\noriginal save date\n\n.\nOpen the document and save it. (that will become your creation date)\nNow change the system date to the date you should have submitted it or day before.\nAgain open the document and make some kind of small modification then save it again.\nThat will become your modification date.\nHere is a sample I just made (notice the dates are not from today but from what I choose them to be).\n\nYou are done.\nDo not open and modify the documents after your have changed your system date to today.\n", "Q: Where can you buy Apple earphones?

I would need the script to \"copy this file to AppName/DEBIAN/ and create the DEBIAN folder if it doesn't exist.\nWhere AppName == A specific line from the control file\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: EDIT: Workflow now works with one bug: running the workflow twice results in two copies of the control file being copied\nMake a new Automator SERVICE. At the beginning, for \"receives selected as input\" choose \"documents\". Add the process \"set value of variable\" and make a new \"destination path\" variable (default variable name is \"destination path\"). Add the process \"open finder items\" to the beginning to open the control file. Add the process \"run applescript\" to the workflow the code is the following:\non run {input, parameters}\n\nset LineNumber to (the line in which the path is specified in the control file)\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    set theVariable to paragraph LineNumber of document 1\n    set thePath to POSIX path of theVariable\n    set thePath to text 1 thru -2 of thePath\nend tell\n\nreturn thePath\nend run\n\nI don't know why this couldn't have been in the same block, but you need to add a separate AppleScript process. The code is as follows:\non run {input, parameters}\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theFolder to POSIX path of input & \"/DEBIAN\"\n    try\n        make new folder in folder input with properties {name:\"DEBIAN\"}\n    end try\nend tell\n\nreturn theFolder\nend run\n\nAdd the process \"set value of variable\" and make a new destination path variable (default name is \"destination path 1\").\nAdd the \"get value of variable\" process and get the value of the variable with the path of the input file (\"destination path\"). Click on \"options\" on this process and check \"ignore this action's input\".\nAfter this, Automator has a process called \"copy finder items\" and this can be used to copy the input (the output of \"get value of variable\", which is the input file). This worked for me, hope it works for you as well. Good luck :)\n", "Q: ellipses dots in iPhone message app but no message sent So, this might be a bit of a dumb question but sometimes I text someone and then I get the ellipsis back and then I usually get a message. However, sometimes I never get a message back and am curious. Does this mean they started typing something they didn't send? Is it possible that they are texting someone else? More curious than anything.\n\nA: Most likely they started and stopped.  Maybe they saw you typing at the same time and you both decided to wait for the message before  responding?

I have a jail broken iPhone and I want to change the default media player from \"music\" to \"pandora downloader\". I am thinking the only way to do this would be with I file? The main thing I want is to have pandora downloader play anytime I hit the play button.\n\nA: There is no current way to make Pandora Downloader the default music app on iPhone (even jailbroken). There is a way to make Spotify the default music player (see here), but all that tweak does is change the little icon in the multitasking bar. When pressing play the music app still plays. While maybe that is a technical issue, there is also the functional problem of what the phone should do when the button is pressed. Should it play a random song? The first song in a playlist?

I have them both installed but when I attempt to run man sshfs on my commandline I get a command not found error.\nUnless I am missing something, I can't find simple instructions to help me resolve this issue.\nI have tried Mount and Mount_smbfs too but I immediately get server connection failed: operation timed out errors.\nMy Mac runs on OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G63)\nCan anyone please give me some simple steps to help overcome this obstacle?\n\nA: First, you don't want to have both MacFUSE and FUSE for OS X (OSXFUSE) installed, OSXFUSE is a replacement for MacFUSE, which is no longer under active development. \nOSXFUSE is not an application, it is a kernel extension and libraries that allow developers to easily write a file system that lives in user space rather than in the kernel. Once you have it installed you need to then install a file system, in your case sshfs, which can be found on the OSXFUSE website (http://osxfuse.github.io/).\nOnce you have both OSXFUSE and sshfs installed then you still won't have a Mac application, but you will have a command line tool sshfsin /usr/local/bin and a man sshfs at the command line will give you the manual page for it.\nIf you would like a GUI then you can install Macfusion (http://macfusionapp.org/) and follow the instructions here (https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/SSHFS#macfusion) so that it uses the much more reliable OSXFUSE version of sshfs rather than the MacFUSE based one it ships with.\n\nA: It looks like the software might not be installed the right way, or in the right place.  On a Mac, the easiest way to install sshfs and fuse is with Homebrew.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Homebrew http://brew.sh/ \n\n*brew install sshfs\nThis will install dependencies such as fuse4x.  Read all the instructions that appear -- some of other steps may be required, such as\nbrew link fuse4x\nsudo /bin/cp -rfX /usr/local/Cellar/fuse4x-kext/0.9.2/Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext /Library/Extensions\nsudo chmod +s /Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext/Support/load_fuse4x\n\nA: If you have installed Fuse for OSX you will find the binary you are searching at /Applications/Macfusion.app/Contents/PlugIns/sshfs.mfplugin/Contents/Resources/sshfs-static.\nYou can use ln -s [Path-like-above] [Your-favorit-bin-path]/sshfs if you want to call it with sshfs.\nIf you get a command not found error and not a No manual entry for sshfs, then man is not found and this indicates no issue with sshfs.\n", "Q: How do I setup a Mac mini server to support a dual drive configuration of System files and User files? User Accounts preferences on OS X allows separating User Accounts from the System files on the principal Hard Disk drive. I have attempted this configuration on three different mac computers. Unfortunately, this excellent idea has a short life expectancy, because inevitably user permissions become hopelessly compromised. After seeking support from Apple Care services, I was told that although Apple facilitates the utilization of this process in System Preferences, in practice it cannot supply the user any support when trouble arises.\nIt occurred to me, that putting a user account on a server and the system files on a client computer, the disruption of permissions could be avoided. Is this a feasible plan to implement on Snow Leopard and later OS?\n\nA: If you just link the home folders to a afp share, this does not work! You have to setup a directory server and maybe even a profil manager via the Server.app on your mini server. \n", "Q: Simple Script for URI Handling Basically what I'd like to know is how can I setup a shell script (or an Applescript or Automator wrapper for a shell script) as a protocol handler for a custom URI (so clicking them will trigger my script) with the URI passed in as an argument?\nFor example, if my URI looked something like:\nfoo://haravikk.com/request?id=1234&name=bar\n\nHow could I setup a shell script on OS X to be triggered any time a URI with protocol \"foo\" is clicked, and to receive the entire URI as an argument I can then process? I already have the script for processing done, just don't know how to get it triggered in the first place :)\n\nA: This technique works for me.\nHere are some other relevant answers from around Stack Exchange:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where does Mac OS X store file association information?\n\n*How do I configure custom URL handlers on OS X?\n\n*How can I manually change default applications in OS X?\n\n*How does Mountain Lion set the default text editor for the “open -t” terminal command?\n\n*Is it possible to query the launch services database for applications that will open an arbitrary file or UTI type?\n\n*How to remove an URL protocol default handler\nA couple of relevant utilities are RCDefaultApp and duti.\n", "Q: Send short message to another Mac on the LAN I am looking for an OS X application that will allow me to send a short message (URL, etc.) to another Mac running on the same LAN or WiFi.\nI have two Macs at work, my company iMac and personal MacBook Pro, sitting side-by-side.

In Spotlight you can enable and disable file categories that will appear in search results.  \nHow does Spotlight determine that a certain file belongs to a certain category?\nThe following specific event triggered this curiosity:\nFor some time .tex files would come up under the Documents category. Spotlight would handle the search filename.tex just fine. Then suddenly I could not find .tex files anymore in Spotlight. Finder searches were OK though. \nTurns out that I had the Developer category disabled in the Spotlight preferences, and Spotlight now thought that .tex files belonged in that category. After enabling the Developer category everything went back to normal.\nWhat made Spotlight decide to switch categories for the .tex files?\n\nA: I think it depends on the parent UTIs defined in an application's Info.plist or in /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Info.plist. .tex is not included in the CoreTypes Info.plist, so the UTI depends on which application's UTI declaration was registered first. For example on my installation the UTI was com.barebones.bbedit.tex-source and the first parent UTI was public.source-code:\n$ touch a.tex; mdls -n kMDItemContentTypeTree a.tex\nkMDItemContentTypeTree = (\n    \"com.barebones.bbedit.tex-source\",\n    \"public.source-code\",\n    \"public.plain-text\",\n    \"public.text\",\n    \"public.data\",\n    \"public.item\",\n    \"public.content\"\n)\n\nWhen I deleted BBEdit and rebuilt the Launch Services database, the UTI became org.tug.tex and the first parent UTI became public.text:\n$ touch b.tex; mdls -n kMDItemContentTypeTree b.tex\nkMDItemContentTypeTree = (\n    \"org.tug.tex\",\n    \"public.text\",\n    \"public.data\",\n    \"public.item\",\n    \"public.content\",\n    \"public.plain-text\"\n)\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem with one of my TeX documents, that developed immediately after TeXShop updated itself while I had the document open.\nI tried the UTI listing trick above, and it turns out all my other TeX documents are categorised as either \"org.tug.tex\" or \"edu.uo.texshop.tex\".  These all come up as 'Documents' in Spotlight searches.  However, the one file that was open while TeXShop updated has now been categorised as \"com.barebones.bbedit.tex-source\" which seems to fall into the 'Developer' category.\nPerhaps the moral of the story in my case is: close all TeXShop documents before allowing the application to update itself.\n", "Q: Resume file move after Finder crash (unmoved items appear washed out) I was moving a large amount of data to an external drive.  The Finder crashed (or appeared to restart) in the middle of the operation.\nNow the files appear as \"washed out\" in the external drive (exFAT), and the move operation doesn't resume.   If I try to move again, the Finder tells me that \n\nThe selected items can’t all be put into the same location, because at\n  least one of them named “something” is busy.\n\nWhy does this happen? What does the washed out appearance mean? Is there a way to resume the move?  Is it safe to just delete the washed out items (note that it was a move, not a copy)?\n\n\nA: The \"washed out\" items are basically just placeholders that the files were meant to be copied into. Those files aren't anything until the copy finishes and the real files are there. You can safely delete them and start over.\nStep one, I would just reboot. This makes sure any copy operations are ended and you know it's safe to delete the placeholders once you've rebooted.\nSometimes Finder gets upset about you trying to delete its placeholders because it thinks they are still in use (busy). If this happens, open Terminal and use\nsudo rm -rf /path/to/file/\n\nReplace /path/to/file/ with the actual path, obviously.\nThat command will allow you to delete ANYTHING, even stuff your Mac needs to run, so make SURE you point it at the right files. They will be gone after this command runs, ignoring all warnings and restrictions. ...but that's fine for these placeholders; you just want them gone so you can try again.\n\nA: When finder copies a file it appears to use a magic file creation date to indicate busy \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/444561/how-can-i-tell-if-a-file-or-folder-is-busy-e-g-the-finder-is-busy-copying-to-i\nI just used \nSetFile -d '2016/02/04 12:00:00' myfile\n\nAnd the folder/file was no longer busy\n\nA: Deleting finder preferences and then restart worked for me:\ncd /Users/chandan.bansal/Library/Preferences\nrm -rf com.apple.finder.plist\nrm -rf com.apple.finder.plist.lockfile\nrm -rf com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\nrm -rf com.apple.sidebarlists.plist.lockfile\n\nThen restart your system.\n\nA: If you have a washed out folder thats busy in the finder, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename it\nsudo mv Folder Folder2\n\n\n*Make a new folder\nmkdir Folder\n\n\n*Move all contents\nsudo mv Folder2/* Folder/\n\nAnd you're set.\n", "Q: Deleting files doesn't free up space I moved away (to an external drive) about 30 GB of files from a drive (startup disk) that had 60 GB of free space.

The trash is emptied.\nI tried rebooting and verifying the disk (no problems found), but it didn't change anything.\nHow can I diagnose and fix the problem?\nNote: this is what happened during the move.  I deleted the \"washed out\" items and repeated the move. \n\nUpdate: The space was being taken up by Time Machine's Mobile Backups feature. This has solved the problem.\n\nA: The washed out appearance happened to me once on a failed copy, in my case the files all had an improper creation date. In fact changing the date on the file fixed the issue for me. I think I used the info on this page to change the created date of the files. http://blog.grapii.com/2010/07/change-a-files-creationmodified-date-on-mac-os-x/\n\nA: I'm thinking there's a permissions issue with the faded icons.  \nMaybe open a terminal and try to sudo rm -r whatever is left?  \n", "Q: I uninstalled xcode 4.6 and the App Store still wants to update it A few months ago the app store notified me to update xcode.

I removed xcode it from /Applications and any other references I could find and emptied the trash. I cleared caches, repaired permissions, and more, restarting both the computer and the application several times. I even enabled the debug menu and reset the application. Despite all of this, xcode still wants to update even though it no longer exists on disk.\nI'm running mountain lion. I'm not sure if I had xcode 4.5 or 4.6 because it's all gone now (except the app store doesn't know it yet).\n\nA: Do you have a backup, or external drive connected, that may have something of the Xcode install on it?\nI know on my machine, if I have my backup drive connected the MAS thinks anything on that drive is currently installed.\n\nA: If you don't need Xcode any longer you can hide it under \"Purchases\" by right-clicking on Xcode and selecting \"Hide Purchase\".\nPerhaps this works on the updatepage too.

I'm not listening on port 25 as per netstat and I don't see any postfix processes running. \nWhat's causing the error? Why would I get it if postfix isn't running?\n\nA: Sounds like you have postfix installed and running.\nYou should check your postfix configuration.\nThere is a good description here.\nOr do it your self:\nIf postfix is still not working, check the log file in /var/log/mail.log for the error: \n\nsendmail: fatal: chdir /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool: No such file\n  or directory\n\nTo fix this, run the following commands in Terminal:\nsudo mkdir -p /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool\nsudo /usr/sbin/postfix set-permissions\nsudo /usr/sbin/postfix start\n\nIf as you say you do not want it to be on your computer then disable it.\nsudo /bin/launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist\n\nThat does not answer your question who is using it, but without more info from you one can not say, it could be a script in your system.\nYou could try to find out who is sending by going to \nOpen your Console:\nScroll down to Var/Log/mail.log\n\nThe background: Mac OSX comes with the postfix MTA, which is a fully\n  featured SMTP server. Under normal circumstances, there is usually no\n  need to enable or configure this software, as most email access is\n  usually done via GUI clients such as the Mail.app – which uses the\n  POP/IMAP and SMTP settings to connect with the email service provider.\n  However, there are certain circumstances in which having a local SMTP\n  server is very useful, such as: Allowing the batch logs and output\n  from the cron daemon or other scripts to be sent via Internet email\n  (this is otherwise delivered locally) Testing email based code; which\n  requires a local sendmail like SMTP server to be present\n\n", "Q: View info about PNG files I have a bunch of PNG files and I want to be able to:\n\n\n*\n\n*tell their pixel size\n\n*preview them\n\n*their file size\n\n\nvery quickly.

If I bought another one, and connected both of my drives to my Mac, would it somehow be possible for me to access the data on them?\n\nA: Yes - Apple's software RAID works so that once all the drives are present (or in the case of RAID mirroring - enough drives to ensure one copy of the data is present), you can then mount the RAID volume.\nUnless you used a third party RAID driver in software or hardware, just getting the drives mounted should work.\n", "Q: iPhone USB adapter - draws current when not charging? I leave my iPhone charger plugged in all day. Does it draw current when I'm not charging my phone?\n\nA: If the USB cord is not plugged into anything on the other end it should not be drawing any power that would be worth speaking of.\nHowever if you are talking about the USB charger box that converts a normal power outlet to USB power to charge your iPhone then yes, those do draw power as long as they are plugged in. You can tell as they get very warm even when not charging.\nIt is recommended to unplug any electronics when they are not in use to save power, however I do not do this unless I am not using it for a few days.\n\nA: Yes it does, it has a transformer in it where the current passes true at all time as long it is plugged in to a socket.\nSince it is in idle mode it might draw some micro amps.\nTo put it in prospective\n1 Amp = 1000 mA\nand 1 Milli Amp = 1000 uA (micro amps)\nSo it is drawing 10-6 Amps :) (one millionths of a Amp)\nSo from consumption it is to small to even consider.\n", "Q: MAC OS X 10.8.4 Login Stuck on password - Restart logind service?

I've found this issue and various discussions online about this, but no obvious \"just do this\", so I'm wandering over here from ServerFault to ask this.\nIs there a way to disable or hard-set the input level on a mic?  In the Sound preferences on the Input tab if I click on the device and set a level and then start talking it picks up the sound and then start to auto-adjust the mic input level.\nThis causes issues when talking with someone on Lync/Skype/etc because one minute the sound is fine and then if you raise your voice for a second and then lower it back down (or shift around in your chair) the auto-adjust causes the other party to think your whispering or yelling.\nI'd like to be able to disable the auto-adjust if possible.  Yes/No? \nNOTE: The issue is similar this one: iMac OSX 10.8.4 Volume adjusts by itself but rather on the input side and not the output side for me.\n\nA: Turns out that the auto-adjusting mic level was not MacOS, but rather Skype (Version 6.6.0.467).  There is a check box in Skype Preferences to enable/disable it, and once I turned it off the level stays where I set it.\nThe problem is that, apparently, Skype's notion of auto adjusting the mic volume is simply to crank it up to max, no matter what -- even when no call is active.  At around 90% the mic starts picking up background noise, probably the Mac disk or fan, and by 100% that background noise is overwhelming.\nI found that on my MacBook Pro (c. 2008) the mic level at about 75% was good, and I also found it helpful to check the \"Use ambient noise reduction\" check box (just below the mic level slider in the System Preferences/Audio).\n\nA: For me the problem application is Citrix GoToMeeting, which I have to use for work. I'm using a variation of @thetoolman's solution to lower the volume to 49 - 50 every second (no cron job, I just start this whenever I have a meeting):\nwhile true ; do\n    while (( `osascript -e \"input volume of (get volume settings)\"` > 50 )); do\n        osascript -e \"set volume input volume (input volume of (get volume settings) - 2)\";\n        sleep 0.01;\n    done;\n    sleep 1;\ndone; \n\n\nA: You can set it via the command line:\nosascript -e \"set volume input volume 100\"\n\nI have found that OSX Polycom RealPresence Desktop has a similar annoying \"feature\" that adjusts the mic input volume down, but never back up.  My workaround is to have this line in my crontab:\n# Check every minute for mic input < 100%; if it is, dial it up elegantly\n* * * * * while (( `osascript -e \"input volume of (get volume settings)\"` < 100 )); do osascript -e \"set volume input volume (input volume of (get volume settings) + 3)\"; sleep 0.1; done;\n\nThe loops just makes the slider \"slide\" up over a second or so, rather then a hard volume jump.\n\nA: There's a Chrome extension which allows to disable this feature per site: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-automatic-gain-co/clpapnmmlmecieknddelobgikompchkk\n\nA: There's a workaround for macOS that works for all applications:\nYou can create an “Aggregate Device”, which works with a single mic. The Aggregate Device doesn't have its own volume setting, so your applications can't mess with it. (Read the tips if you have multiple input sources.)\n\n*\n\n*Open “Audio MIDI Setup”. You can quickly find this by hitting ⌘ Space, then typing in Audio or MIDI.\n\n\n*Add “Aggregate Device”. In the left column at the bottom, click the + sign and “Create Aggregate Device”.\n\n\n*Click on the new Aggregate Device in the left column, and check Use for your microphone in the right-hand panel.\nThe Aggregate Device will be available as an input in your application. You can still set the sensitivity of the microphone as you normally do, and your app can't affect it anymore because it is hidden in the Aggregate Device.\nTips & Caveats:\n\n*\n\n*If you set the Aggregate Device as the default input device, it will apply to all applications where the default input device is used.\n\n*\n\n*Be sure to set the input volume sensitivity of your mic to the maximum or desired level before switching the default to the Aggregate Device. Check the level occasionally to make sure it hasn't changed.\n\n\n\n*You can create additional Aggregate Devices (one device for each mic) if you have several microphones and frequently switch between them.\n\n*\n\n*Note that creating an Aggregate Device with multiple mics may not work. Some apps may only use the first channel, ignoring the additional channels. Rogue Amoeba Loopback can get around this by creating an aggregate device that only has a single channel, regardless of the number of inputs. It is really slick, and easier to use than Audio MIDI Setup, but costs $99.\n\n\n\n*You can rename the Aggregate Device by double-clicking on the name in the left sidebar (or pressing Return after selecting it).\n\nA: Found the file for Google Talk/Hangouts in ~/Library/Preferences/com.google.GoogleTalkPluginD.plist.\nEdit the file with a preference editor (Xcode, TextWrangler, Pref Setter, etc.) and change the audio-flags setting to 0.\nSeems to be a per-application setting.\nI just tried this out on my 2011 Mac with OS X 10.8.4 and it worked. It's been driving me crazy for 2 years.\n\nA: Had the same issue on Zoom, and as stated above, it's the app, not the OS. There's a preference to disable mic input adjustment.\n\nA: For me on a mac it was Microsoft Teams that caused the problem. Specifically the desktop app. The web app. did modify the level a bit, but was usable. The desktop app. was very difficult. I can open the system preferences and watch the level bounce around between about 2 and 5 % - any time I lift it the volume crashed down again,....\n..... but for some reason the web app. works ok. If I start talking loudly into the mic it does drop the level, but no so much and it even went up a bit when I spoke more softly.\nThis is some combination of Teams and this microphone, because the microphone works well with say Quicktime sound recording.\nthankfully this issue with the desktop app does not affect the internal mac mic too much, it is only the USB PnP device that is mostly unusable.\n\nA: MacOS itself doesn't have auto-adjust option for mic, so there applications which are doing this. You need to check, which applications, which potentially are working with camera/mic have this auto-adjust option and to turn it off.\nI found that it's some glitch in Skype, which appears from time to time. To disable automatic gain control for mic in Skype you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Tools at the top of Skype window\n\n*Select Options\n\n*select Audio Settings\n\n*Under Microphone, uncheck Automatically adjust Microphone settings\nThere's also the option to disable it manually in the config:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit all the instances of Skype\n\n*Go to skype directory, or in terminal execute the command:\n$ cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Skype/\n\n*Open the file called shared.xml for editing, full path to the file is\n~/Library/Application\\ Support/Skype/shared.xml\n\n*Search for the line <VoiceEng> and extend that file like this:\n<VoiceEng>\n    <AGC>0</AGC>\n...\n</VoiceEng> \nthere could be some extra lines like <MicVolume.., etc, leave them there, no changes. AGC set to 0 means OFF, 1 means ON for automatic gain control, which changes the volume.\n\n*Save the shared.xml file, exit, restart Skype. Enjoy! \n\nA: Skype has a Microphone adjustment in Preference Audio Video.\nThere you can disable the Auto setting.\nI do not know about Lync.\n\nA: Microsoft Teams now has an \"Automatically Adjust Mic Sensitivity\" in the Calls section on the left tab. You select the Cog Wheel (Custom Setup) and then disable this feature. Disabling the slider here may help but if there are other applications that are auto-adjusting the mic sensitivity you may still not get the desired results.\n\n\nA: I figured it out! I called Mac support and they had me start my computer while pressing Cmd + Opt + P + R and it resets some things that fixes the problem. Hope this works for everyone like it did for me!\n", "Q: Where are the system spellchecking dictionaries? I would like to use the spellchecking dictionaries bundled with OS X from the command line (hunspell), but can't seem to find them. In /System/Library/Spelling there are only 2 files pl_PL.{aff,dic}, and find / -name '*.dic' revealed nothing.\nI know I can dowload dictionaries from OpenOffice etc., but I'd like to find the ones bundled with OS X.\nEDIT To clarify, there are at least two kinds of dictionaries in OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Definitions used in Dictionary.app. I'm not interested in those.\n\n*Word lists used by the system spellchecker (red dotted lines). I know OS X uses hunspell because the hunspell website says so, and there are numerous posts on how to add new ones (1, 2). Just, I don't want to add new ones but use the English one that obviously comes with the system.\n\n\nA: The spelling dictionaries you are interested in appear to be located in the following location (checked on 10.8.4 and 10.6.8):\n/System/Library/Services/AppleSpell.service/Contents/Resources/\n\nThe word lists are stored in this directory by language, so U.S. English is in the English.lproj folder.\nHowever, these files are stored in a binary format that I haven't deciphered yet...\n\nA: Under macOS Catalina...\nThere are two locations:\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library/Services/AppleSpell.service/Contents/Resources/AppleSpell.8\n\n*/Users/${HOME}/Library/Dictionaries/\nThe first is the system spell check dictionary and the second is the user dictionary that is created/modified when the user adds a learned word.

You can send an receive iMessage when you are online. To send a message, you only need to set the receiving address an Apple ID, or some phone numbers related to the ID. Of course, you network must be well enough to connect to apple.\n", "Q: Which mail daemon does OS X 10.8.4 run by default? I'm debugging some mail related stuff on my Mac, and not quite sure how my system is even sending mail.\nI can run a simple command like date | mail -s test myemail@mydomain.com and receive an email just fine. Cool. I can also use PHP's mail() function to send mail. PHP's sendmail_path configuration variable is /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i, looks okay.\nBut the weird thing is I don't think Postfix is even running...\n$ postqueue -p\npostqueue: fatal: Queue report unavailable - mail system is down\n$ ps -aef | grep -i postfix\n  501 28403 25525   0  2:10PM ttys042    0:00.00 grep -i postfix\n$ launchctl list | grep -i mail\n-   0   com.apple.MailMigratorService\n70829   -   0x7fa87941a060.anonymous.Mail\n$ launchctl list | grep -i postfix\n-   0   org.postfix.master\n\nHow is my Mac even sending mail from the mail terminal command if Postfix isn't running? Is there some other mail daemon OS X runs?\n\nA: It is using postfix. At a high-level, when you execute the mail command, the following is happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*Invoking mail drops your message as a file in the postfix maildrop directory, i.e.,  /var/spool/postfix/maildrop. This happens because mail calls sendmail which calls postdrop which puts the file in the maildrop.\n\n*The postfix main daemon, master is configured to startup when the maildrop has files in it. This is specified in the /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist file.\n\n*The master daemon starts other needed postfix processes such as pickup, qmgr and smtp to deliver the mail.\n\n*All these process including the master daemon die after being idle for period of time.\n\n\nThe postqueue -p command needs the showq daemon which will be started  only when master is running. When that's not the case, you see that error. The showq daemon can be configured to always be running so that you can use the postqueue -p command. If you want to just see the mail queue, you can do this:\n$ sudo postfix start && postqueue -p && sudo postfix stop\n\nBut note that if you start it this way, you must shut it down too. Otherwise the postfix master daemon will be resident and won't be on-demand anymore.\nIf you want to know which processes start after you issue mail, you can use the execsnoop command to see which process are starting up:\n$ sudo execsnoop -v\nSTRTIME                UID    PID   PPID ARGS\n2016 Apr 20 23:57:52   501   2358   1154 mail\n2016 Apr 20 23:57:52   501   2359   2357 date\n2016 Apr 20 23:57:52   501   2360      1 sendmail\n2016 Apr 20 23:57:52   501   2367   2360 postdrop\n2016 Apr 20 23:57:52     0   2369   2343 cleanup\n2016 Apr 20 23:58:23     0   2384      1 master\n2016 Apr 20 23:58:23     0   2385   2384 pickup\n2016 Apr 20 23:58:23     0   2386   2384 qmgr\n2016 Apr 20 23:58:24     0   2387   2384 bounce\n2016 Apr 20 23:58:24     0   2388   2384 trivial-rewrite\n2016 Apr 20 23:58:24     0   2389   2384 local\n2016 Apr 20 23:58:24     0   2390   2384 smtp\n\n", "Q: How do I remove duplicate albums from my iPhone 5's music app?

When I enter the password, it keeps saying it is wrong password. I think I was by able to finish the whole setup assistant also. I am very new to Mac. I have no idea how things are done. \n\nA: Have you tried just pressing the return key when asked for a password?

It's a great (free) application! It will allow you to download folders from a site. So, just enter in your URL and click \"Download\"\n\n\nSiteSucker is a Macintosh application that automatically downloads Web sites from the Internet. It does this by asynchronously copying the site's Web pages, images, backgrounds, movies, and other files to your local hard drive, duplicating the site's directory structure. Just enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), press return, and SiteSucker can download an entire Web site.\n\n\nA: You can use wget like this:\nwget -r -nd -A.mp3 http://www.parweztv.com/Khan%20Adeeb/SURA-04/\n\n-r to recursively download all files below the level of the URL specified\n-nd to not create a hierarchy of directories in your download location (not necessary)\n-A to specify the files you want to download (all files ending in .mp3 in your case)\nYou can obtain wget for OSX via homebrew or macports.\n\nA: You can write a script for that (preferably in PHP or python, or any other scripting language which has bindings to libxml). but I'm not aware of any solutions that use curl or wget only.\nHowever, there exist GUI level programs for batch downloading. One example is the DownThemAll! Add-On for Firefox.\n", "Q: How can I get all photos in PhotoStream on my iPhone?

Can you see the photos on this computer? If you are using iPhoto or Aperture and the photos you are looking for are not visible in these programs, they have already been removed from the iCloud server and cannot be re-synced to iPhone (at least not through Photo Stream). iCloud only stores the last 30 days worth, or 1000 photos, whichever limit is hit first.\nOn the iPhone, go to Settings then iCloud (as seen in the first image below).\nNext, tap on Photo Stream, and ensure the \"My Photo Stream\" slider is set to ON (as seen in the second image below).\n\n\nFinally, (as this is iCloud (grrrh), it might help to turn these settings off, wait a few hours, and turn them on again. I had to do this recently, with photos and mail. Hope this helps.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make some coffee and get ready for longer process; Make sure your iPhone is in WiFi range, as it will need to download missing pictures from Streaming.\n\n*On your iPhone, go to your Photos and empty Camera Roll folder (that is optional, but makes things more clear); \n\n*Make sure you have some reasonable space left on your iPhone (~1Gb);\n\n*In your iPhone's Photos, tap on Streaming, then tap on Edit (pic 1);\n\n*Select all photos needed to be extracted (pic 2);\n\n*Tap on Share and then tap on Save to Camera Roll (pic 3);\n\n\nAll selected photos will be downloaded from Streaming back to your Camera Roll (pic 4).

It keeps me focused or provides me with a reminder to take a break. I also like it when Mail makes a sound when new messages arrive so I can check them. I like all these sounds when I'm using my computer.\nWhat I don't like is these sounds when I'm not using my computer mainly because my Mac is in my bedroom. Usually the solution is simply to mute the Mac before bed but I sometimes forget and am woken up by an announcement telling me the time or letting me know new mail is in during the middle of the night.\nWithout putting my computer to sleep (I want it awake at all times when plugged in so it can do things I need it to do), is there any way my Mac can mute its sound when it is idle (or more preferably idle for some period of time)?\n\nA: I wanted the same and didn't find anything nice, so I coded an app for myself. You can find the code here and already as compiled app here.\nLet me know what you think.\n\nA: iCal alarms can be used to activate an AppleScript. \nIf you're simply concerned with forgetting to unmute the Mac in the morning, set an alarm to fire this script at the appointed hour:\nset volume without output muted\n\nThe opposite command, which sets the sound to \"muted\", is set volume with output muted. Set an alarm that activates that at night and you'll be set.\n\nA: I haven't tested this, but you might run EDITOR=nano crontab -e and add a line like this:\n*/5 * * * * test $(ioreg -c IOHIDSystem|awk '/HIDIdleTime/{printf \"\\%i\",$NF/1000000000;exit}') -ge 300 && pmset -g assertions|grep -q 'PreventUserIdleSystemSleep *0'&&osascript -e 'set volume with output muted'\n*/5 * * * * runs the command every five minutes. HIDIdleTime shows how much time has passed since you have for example pressed a key on a keyboard or moved a mouse. There is a PreventUserIdleSystemSleep assertion when you are for example playing music in iTunes or watching a video in VLC.\nThe command does not unmute the output volume when you start using the computer though.\n", "Q: Why does iTunes not recognise a plugged in iPhone on Windows 8.1?

I'd be curious to see where the bottleneck actually is.\nThe other thing I would check is your network setup, and make sure you're not providing DHCP on the super hub and the AE, which would do what's called \"double NAT\" and affect your network. If you have DHCP on both devices then you need to turn it off on the AE and let the super hub handle it. If you do not want that, then set the  super hub to bridge mode and then let the AE do all the networking.\nHTH,\nDave\n", "Q: Mac Pro won't sleep any more The past couple days, command-option-eject no longer puts my Mac Pro to sleep.

I restarted recently and found a kernel panic on startup. I have tried  booting in safe mode (unsuccessful), recovery mode (unsuccessful), reset NV-RAM (unsuccessful startup) and from an OSX install disc (\"unable to install OSX on this computer\"). The last option yielded an actual startup screen ith language options and a box offering the option of restoring from a TM backup (I don't have one as I did not have any important data on this machine). So broadly the machine works but never gets past the grey screen with the apple logo and the time wheel.\nI have another 2 newer MBPs at home and considered using target mode to resuscitate the oldest malfunctioning mac. BTW I can't eject the OSX disc from the bad mac.\nAny advice on how to revive my old Mac? I'd like to keep using it as it was fine yesterday.\nThanks.\n\nA: Too late for this question, but why do people not consult Apple about Kernel Panics? Maybe you had other choices, yesterday. \nMy July 25 answer to similar question:\nRead Apple's own support page, About Kernel Panics , and MacWorld's How To Troubleshoot a Kernel Panic. You'll be able to isolate the problem and from there, know what steps to take, many of which are quite simple.\n\nA: Boot in Target disk mode and see if you can repair the disk... if the disk is fine but the OS is corrupted then do a clean install.

I like to use Messages on my Mac, but it's generally incredibly annoying because every time I receive a message from someone, my iPhone lights up and plays its alert noise, which is a loud ding. I want it to do that in general, but not when I'm actively using Messages on my mac. Is there anyway to fix this situation?  I have considered turning on \"Do not disturb\" on my phone, but I don't want to because I'm liable to forget I did and then miss important messages.\n\nA: Short of enabling Do Not Disturb on iPhone, or disabling notifications for the Messages app on iPhone (even more tedious than remembering to turn Do Not Disturb off), there is no direct way to prevent both iPhone and Mac from alerting you to the same message.\nThat said, I have noticed that if I am actively using Messages on Mac, after a few minutes I will start getting the messages on Mac first, and if I go to the Messages window quickly enough I will not get the alert on iPhone. Once I stop actively using Messages on Mac, the alerts on iPhone start appearing in a timely manner again. It seems to recognize which system or device you are actively using and delays notifications to the other systems/devices by a bit. The same occurs when I am using iPad - notifications on Mac and iPhone are delayed enough that if I read the message on iPad quickly enough, I will not get the notifications on the other devices.\nI am not sure if the above is actually an unadvertised feature or just network delay, but it occurs consistently enough that I am quite sure there is some Apple intervention going on there.\n\nA: You can turn the notification sound off on the Mac so that it doesnt irritate you. Also you can choose to only get the notifications if your name is mentioned on the Mac Messages.\nAll of this can be done in Messages preferences.\n", "Q: Get nic name and interface via command line?

It's not a big problem. Just curious.\n\nA: Let's assume you are mounting/attaching your Data drive as usual which will result in paths like /Volumes/Data/ContentA and /Volumes/Data/ContentB.

Upon every login to my computer, I notice in Activity Monitor I have several instances of a process called \"postgres\" running, under the user \"postgres\". \nWhat is this, and why does it launch every time I log in?\nFrom what I gathered, it is an SQL server that is built into Unix systems. But that is as far as I got.\nAny insight would be much appreciated.\nEdit: AHA! It appeared after I installed Blackmagic's DaVinci Resolve. When it installs the CUDA package, it also installs the PostgreSQL server. Interesting. \n\nA: PostgreSQL is a relational database engine. You might have  heard of MySQL? It does a similar sort of job.\nApple, for reasons unscrutable and strange, decided that they wanted to bundle PostgreSQL in some Mac OS X versions as a pre-installed application. Consequently it comes with some versions of Mac OS X.\nAdditionally, some 3rd party software will bundle PostgreSQL because it uses it to store and manage its data. It won't always be obvious what the program is.\nPostgreSQL generally uses little CPU, RAM or disk I/O unless it's actually being used for serious work, so it's fairly safe to ignore it. If you're really determined to get rid of it (say, you think it might be stopping your non-SSD-based mac from spinning down its hard drive) then stop it and leave it installed but not running. If nothing breaks, disable it in launchd, but do not uninstall it. That way it has no effect  but is easily restored if you discover there was a problem after all.\n(Note that PostgreSQL databases aren't compatible across versions. If you delete an installed copy of 8.2 then decide you wanted that data after all, you would have to install a compatible build of 8.2 to read the data; installing the latest 9.3 release, or even 8.4, would not work).\n\nA: PostgresSQL is an open source database management system. It is extremely likely that another piece of software that you downloaded is dependent on it. I would advise against removing it as it can mess with the functionality of other programs.\n", "Q: Can I inherit a Time Machine backup if I clone my HD? I have an old Power Mac G5 running OS X 10.5.8 (The newest OS it can run). It is backed up regularly using Time Machine to my Time Capsule.\nThe main drive is 500 GB but I would like to replace it with a 1 TB drive by cloning it, possibly with SuperDuper. Is it possible to trick Time Machine to continuing on with the same sparsebundle rather than starting a fresh, new backup? I don't have much space left on my Time Capsule so a whole new backup would be difficult.\n\nA: Time machine uses the UUID (drive ID) to identify the source disk. So, inheriting time machine backup to continue with the swapped Mac machine is not possible rather you can use this command:\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a\n\nMoreover, you can create an image of time machine partition and restore the data from the created image.\n", "Q: Restore iPad to factory-default How to make iPad back to factory default without iTunes, restrictions code, iCloud, or backup.

I fill out webforms on my iphone fairly often. I use autocomplete to speed this process along, and it works pretty well for the most part. However, for some reason, it always insists on using an @facebook.com email address in the email field.\nI do not use Facebook for email. I never have, never will, and never want to. I do use Facebook for lots of other things, and thus, would prefer not to turn off iOS's Facebook integration, which seems to be the only workaround that googling has offered me.\nHow can I force auto-complete to use my preferred email address, rather than the one associated with my Facebook account?\n\nA: Go to account settings in Facebook (web) -> general -> email\nUntick \"use your Facebook email\"\nYou may need to then re sync your Facebook contacts. \nHey presto... It's sorted!!\n\nA: Open up your contact card that is linked to your autofill\nChange the label on your facebook email to 'other' or something else and change the label on the email that needs to be auto filled to 'email' or 'home' if 'email' is not available.\nIf that doesn't work unlink facebook and link facebook again. Facebook should now be at the bottom.\nAutofill should pick the top email address.\n\nA: I had the same problem, you need to go to System Preferences > Mail, Contacts & Calendars, select your Facebook account then untick the Contacts checkbox http://take.ms/AD4o8V \nThen you can select any of the fields in your Contacts app and \"reclaim\" your desired main email address.\n\nA: First, I created a new contact in my contacts for myself with just my email, and the other specific info I want used for autofill in it, using a name that was not at all similar to the one currently being used (i.e. \"hello kitty\" or something that you will be able to easily pick out).\nThen, I went into Settings → Safari → Passwords & Autofill → My Info. Then type the name you previously created into the search box to choose it as the info you want used for autofill.\nVoila! This worked for me.\n\nA: Found an answer for this that worked for me.\n1. Go into your contact information and 'unlink' your facebook contact from your regular contact.\n2. Go into settings > mail, contacts, cals and make sure the correct contact is selected (non-facebook contact)\n3.

Man this was bugging me.\n\nA: I went into Settings and then scrolled down to Facebook (it was in the 7th group of items listed together in a white box background) and in there under \"Allow these app to use this account\" I turned the little slidey-switch-thing to off. \n\nA: *\n\n*Go to your iOS Facebook app. On the left side tap on General then tap email then scroll to the bottom , you will see use your Facebook email. Uncheck the box.\n\n*Go back to your iPhone contact list, scroll and find your name, click edit on the top left side. Scroll down until you find the notorious Facebook email. This time it will have a red button where you can delete it.

Thanks,\n\nA: Sounds like you have got restrictions turned on, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is these restrictions that are causing you an issue, you could have turned these on long ago and forgotten what password was setup (for sure, someone has turned this on and a password is required as part of this process).\nIf the missing safar is due to restrictions, then there is simply no choice other than recalling the password, or possibly restoring the phone from an old backup on the chance that the backup pre-dates the turning on of restrictions.\nBut icons often go missing for other reasons due to a particularly mean bug.  You can reset your homescreen layout to restore missing icons when this happens, (warning, it will reset the location and grouping of all your icons when you do this) by going to  Settings > Reset > Reset Home Screen Layout.\nOne final note, you may have simply moved it somewhere daft into a folder or something by accident - can you find Safari in Spotlight search?\n\nA: Since the restrictions are turned on, Its highly possible that someone turned safari off, and set the restriction.\nFind out who used your phone other than you before safari went off, and ask them to put in the password. \nThe resolutions is what Stuffe suggested.

That's just how it is? I know that being at 6000 RPM constantly was not normal, but what about these spikes to 5000 and back for no apparent reason?\n\nA: Sounds like the symptoms of a runaway process using a lot of CPU. Sometimes there are also valid reasons. If it reoccurs your best course of action is to open the Activity Monitor, and look for something using a lot of CPU time and try to determine if there is a valid reason for this (an example might be you have added lots of little files that are being indexed by mds (the indexer daemon for Spotlight)\n\nA: You should try to reset your SMC.

In System Preferences -> Sound, I can select \"Internal Microphone\" or \"Line In\" and I get nothing on the volume bar for either when I speak. I moved the input volume slider all the way to right and I still get nothing, but oddly enough as I move the slider I register sound.

You can access your Applications folder by opening a new Finder window and locating \"Applications\" on the left of this window.  Alternately you can access your Applications using Launchpad, either by clicking on Launchpad (circular silver icon on your Dock), pressing F4 on your keyboard or invoking Launchpad with a 4 finger pinching gesture on your trackpad.\nApplications downloaded from the internet, using a web browser such as Safari or Firefox, will go to your Downloads folder by default.  You can access your Downloads folder by opening a new Finder window and locating \"Downloads\" on the left of this window.  Often applications will be downloaded as a Disk Image, a virtual disk of sorts.  You can open the Disk Image by double clicking on it's icon.  Once opened you will see it's contents, often the application and a \"read me\" text.  Often installation consists of dragging the application to your Applications folder.  Once the application is in your Applications folder you can then drag it to the Dock in order to create a shortcut, so you don't have to navigate to Applications every time you need the application.\nAlternately, you should be able to use Spotlight (the magnifying glass in the upper right corner of your screen - command+spacebar is it's shortcut) to search for the new app.  The only time I can imagine this not working is if it's downloaded as a disk image with an abbreviated name.\nHopefully that helps!\n\nA: Apps do not get placed in the dock when you download them from the Mac app store. They do get placed in Launchpad - so if you don't see them (especially after searching by name), then some sort of problem or corruption has arrived on your Mac.\nYou also could have a problem with Spotlight and need to remedy that if searching for the app in normal spotlight (or spotlight within Launchpad) can't find an app you know you downloaded.\n\nA: Depends on your computer set up.\nIn my case all downloads go it to the \"downloads folder\".\nIt should be in the Finder side bar, or as Doc icon, or just look for it.\nThen and there I can decide if to install now later or newer.\n", "Q: Ethernet connection turns off when my Mac idles I often leave my Mac for some time to do assorted tasks.

Is there any way I can connect to the internet through my iPad Mini or vice verse, without a jailbreak?\n\nA: Just had the same issue in my hotel in the Dominican Republic, where I enjoy a great snow-free christmas. The hotel locks the DCHP to the MAC address of the first device that connects, thereby limiting usage to one device per paying customer--they think.\nJust note the MAC address belonging to the wi-fi adapter of your first device and then you can soft-set that for each of your other MacBooks, Windows laptops or what have you.

It's not perfect, but at least you do not have to pay multiple fees.\n\nA: Not in any reasonable manner. Instead, use a portable WISP router.

After you turn on Personal Hotspot, other devices can\n  connect in the following ways: • W-Fi: On the device, choose your iPad\n  from the list of available Wi-Fi networks.\n\nAs @Patrix pointed out, it all depends where your \"source\" wifi comes from.\nThere is always a BUT :)\nBut, since you think you can get only one WiFi connection in the place you are going, try Boingo, to see if they have something there.\nIn my case, when the hotels are trying to rip me off (like $20 per day for internet use), I use my unlocked phone, go to local store and buy a SIM with Internet for cheep.\n\nA: iOS devices can not relay WiFi signals to other devices (at least not without a jailbreak). To share a single WiFi login with several devices you need to set up a WiFi repeater. Airport Express is one device which can do that, D-Link 505 is another one which I have successfully used for this purpose. \n\nA: Most hotel/resort captive portals require you to pay for each device that is connected to the WiFi, if you want access to the outside world.  It is more than likely possible that you could pay twice, (Onnce for your iPad, once for your iPhone) and get the same results..\nSpoofing the MAC address on one of your iOS devices is non-trivial and would require jailbreaking.  Also, to have two devices with the name MAC on the same network at the same time will cause problems.  Simultaneous use is out of the question - in fact you will need to turn one device off in order to use the second device for any period of time.\nAlso..  will you have a cellular data connection?  Can the iPhone continue to use this data connection, while you iPad uses the WiFi?\nI know that none of the above actually provides you with the answer you were looking for.    \n\nA: You could buy a Dlink 506l device -   It will do this.  $44 from Amazon.   You can also use it as a travel router or to stream/share files from a USB drive.   \nIt does a lot for $44.   But needs a firmware upgrade (easy) to work properly.  \n\nA: Sharing internet connection from one iPhone to another works well if one of the iPhone has a valid Data Simcard with internet and personal hotspot is turn on. \nOnce you have done that turn on the wi-fi on the other iPhone that has no internet and let it search search...once detected connect it, that's it. It works well for me and my friends.\n", "Q: How can I display the current DNS servers from the command line under OS X?

I like getting Growl notifications for incoming emails in Mail.app, but I'd prefer not to have to keep Mail.app running to see them. Is there a setting or third party tool for this?\n\nA: If you're just using Gmail (like OP), then you can use the program Gmail Notifr. It lives in your menubar, and checks Gmail at a specified interval, it also supports Growl notifications. \n\nA: It is NOT possible to get mail notifications without having the mail application active.\nThere is no way for notifications to know when you got new mail if there is no active connection to your mail server.\nIf you want, you can hide the mail app window (red dot).\nBut as always there are alternatives.\nAssuming you use gmail and assuming you use Chrome browser than you can set it up to get your new eamil notification without using Apple Mail.\nDesktop notifications in Chrome\n\nGmail desktop notifications let you know when you have a new email or\n  Chat message. When you enable these notifications, you'll see a pop-up\n  when new messages arrive so that even if you're not looking at your\n  Gmail, you'll still know when someone wants to talk to you. For now,\n  these notifications are available only if you use Google Chrome as\n  your browser.\n\nFinaly there is another alternative.\nIf you care to do some set up and some scripting, you can use the Postfix.\nMac OSX comes with the \n\npostfix MTA\n\n, which is a fully featured SMTP server.\nThere are plenty of instructions on the web how to do that.\n", "Q: iPad apps transferring to iPhone through iCloud If I download any app on my iPad will it download itself to my iPhone?

This is not about gaming performance. I've got that all sorted when booting into Windows. \nThis is a 2012 version rMBP.\nThe question is about trying to gain a little more control over the hardware from the OS X-side. \nDuring the summer, the machine runs acceptably cool under typical usage, for example, web browsing, even mp4/h.264 (non-flash) video decoding, etc. I was watching a 1080p Blu-ray rip the other day. Handled it fine.\nHowever, once I plug in my external 2560x1440 display via a MiniDP-to-DL-DVI adapter, the display will only connect if the GT 650M is switched on. I use gfxCardStatus to control whether this Nvidia GPU is allowed to be switched to. \nSo this is fine, except that now I have to keep the fan spinning at higher RPMs (controlled through smcFanControl, of course), and even with that the temperature reads above 70 degrees C most of the time. It will generally be in the mid 50's to low 60's range when running the integrated GPU. \nI know these are not very specific numbers, but the point is that whenever the Nvidia GPU is powered on the machine is producing a lot more power as heat.\nAccording to an app I have here called \"BatteryExpert\" it draws around 11 watts on integrated and 19 watts with the second screen plugged in.\nSo my question is how can I see the clock speed of the Nvidia GPU, and how can I adjust it in hopes of cooling it down, but still keep it enabled? I need it to be powered on for the secondary monitor, but it's making the aluminum surface a bit too warm for comfort for typing. \nI am able to boot to Windows to run e.g. GPU-Z there to check the clocks, but on Windows I'm not aware of any app that can read out a power draw wattage, so it's a little difficult to corroborate. (I guess I can compare idle temps, though.)\nIt may turn out to be the case that that ~8 watt difference (which results in the 15+ degree C difference in temperature, and a similar difference felt on the aluminum surface) is fully accounted for by running the 650M at its lowest power level, as it is after all a ~50W unit. I'm not really sure what to think. On the one hand 50W is at 900Mhz under load, and here it should be ~165Mhz ('s what GPU-Z tells me in Windows) idle. \nWell I've gone off in the weeds at this point. The question is, what is some monitoring software to show me the GPU clocks? When I tried iStat Menus it did not have a GPU clocks reading.\n\nA: If you don't need to use the MBP screen while using the external monitor you can disable it using a small magnet.\nA small magnet placed on the left side of the MBP keyboard, more or less above where the SD card reader is placed, will make it think that the lid is closed. The GPU will need to do less work to drive just one screen (the external) and use less power, and with the lid still open the airflow will be beter.\nI use this on a 2011 MBP, other versions may need to have the magnet placed at different places for it to detect a closed lid. And if you try this, please use the smallest magnet available.\n\nA: Not really.\nFirst I just want to clarify a few things, though you might already be aware of them. The integrated graphics can only draw to the built in display in this case. It physically cannot output a stream through DisplayPort, it's not that the chip is incapable of it, it's the video switch IC isn't wired up to with dual graphics MBP's.\nSo, like you said, if you use both the built-in and external display, both cards have to be working. And when the discrete card starts drawing, there's a bump in power usage, and your machine runs hotter, as you've noted. And it would run even hotter if you use any OpenGL/CL (and now, metal) using apps as well.\nAlso, it's worth pointing out that while your case feeling warmer does mean it's using more energy, it also means that the heat is being routed away from the cards as intended. Unibody Macbooks have really bad ventilation.\nSo moving onto the question: no, that is not possible to do in macOS.\nI guess theoretically, it would be possible if you somehow got your hands on the Nvidia drivers and built your own version that allowed you to manually adjust these very low level settings. And then I'd imagine you would have to roll your own version of gMux, which would probably override with power management.\nMy advice would be to resist the urge to control the system management aspects, as after all, they put an SMC on your MBP's logic board with its expensive real estate. Just let it do its job (which it does pretty well in most cases), and if you are positive power is being wasted, the logical angle to tackle the issue would be at the software level. (whatever you're running might not be as optimized as it could be, and using more resources than needed).\nI think some tools that might satisfy your curiosity as to what the power management parameters are at a given time could be found in the additional tools Apple provides on its developer portal. (You might need to sign up for the free developer program, pretty sure you don't need paid membership.)\nGo through the registry values, look around a bit. The hardware side would be something like IODeviceTree:/PCI?@?/P?P?@?, and the firmware side something like IOACPIPlane:/_SB/PCI?@?/P?P?@?????, with varying digits for the ? marks. (integrated video would be IGPU under the PCI tree). It should expose the \"power state\" out of a number of possible values. I didn't dig too deep, and wasn't able to find the clock multiplier, but it also may well be exposed.\nSince IMO, control at this level isn't very feasible, if you want to look on the software side of things, the additional tools image also includes an opengl monitor which would give you all the information available with the driver currently in use. Things like # of shaders, % utilization, GPU time, CPU time spent waiting for GPU, etc.\n", "Q: Mac OS X cannot find the hard drive (anywhere) I suspect this is a dead hard drive issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*blinking question mark folder at startup\n\n*resetting PRAM has no effect\n\n*single user mode not available with Cmd-S\n\n\nWhen I get to Internet Recovery mode, the drive does not show up, either in the Startup Disk dialog, in Disk Utility or in Terminal with ls -a /Volumes\nIs there anything I forgot to check before turning to Dropbox to get my files and Apple to get a new drive?\n(It's all very disappointing, because this is a quite recent MBA, and I thought SSD would spare me these issues.)\n\nA: It does sound like a failed SSD drive, or possibly its PCIe connection on the logic board.  There are two things you can attempt before taking it in to Apple though.\n1) An SMC reset.  This resets the system management controller, which is responsible for directing power flow through the Mac.  A lot of odd issues, not just disappearing hard drives, can be resolved with an SMC reset.  Apple's KB article HT3964 explains this a bit more in detail.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your Mac\n\n*Connect your MagSafe adapter to a power source and then to your Mac\n\n*On the built in keyboard press left Shift + Control + Option + Power button at the same time.  You might notice the MagSafe's LED light change from green to orange, or vice versa, while doing this\n\n*Release all 4 keys/buttons at the same time\n\n*Attempt to power on your Mac as normal by pressing the power button\n\n\n2) Remove the bottom case and reseat the SSD drive.  Obviously this is a bit more involved than performing the SMC reset but it's something I would typically try before taking the time to head to the Apple store.  This does require some specific tools though, a size 5 Pentalobe driver and a Torx 5 driver.  This iFixit walkthrough does a good job showing the process.  Essentially you need to remove the 10 pentalobe screws securing the bottom case, remove the bottom case, disconnect the battery, remove the torx 5 screw securing the SSD, remove and reinsert the SSD ensuring a snug connection, then perform the reverse for reassembly.\nGood luck!  Hopefully either of these is all it takes to get you back up and running.\n", "Q: Set size of window to exact pixels, and place via x, y coordinates I would like to create a tool that allows you to set windows to exact sizes on the pixel scale to be able to have more precise screen divisions.\nFor example, if I had four Terminal windows (and I didn't have something cool like iTerm to do this for me), I'd like to be able to set each one to 1/2 screen height and 1/2 screen width, and people to position them via x, y coordinates so that they took up the entire screen, and exactly one fourth of them individually. \nCan this be done using applescript?\n\nA: I found a few Apple scripts online, but they all seemed to be outdated and no longer worked. I managed to combine them into the following script, which worked for me:\nset theApp to \"Terminal\"\nset appWidth to 1280\nset appHeight to 800\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process theApp\n    tell window 1\n        set position to {50, 50}\n        set size to {appWidth, appHeight}\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThere are couple of caveats:\n\n*\n\n*If the desired appHeight is greater than the main displays's height, the resizing won't quite work. I ended up setting my external monitor as a main display.\n\n*You need to add accessibility permissions for the \"Script Editor\" app as displayed below:\n\n\n\nA: Yes, this can be done using AppleScript.

This was working on the first Mac OS X: remove the useless network interfaces to be sure you are testing the only one you want to trouble shoot.\nConfigure the remaining AirPort interface:\nNetwork name: *your home network name*\n\nand upon request enter your WEP password,\nselect the bottom right Advanced… button and define the TCP/IP\nas static with the following values (which should be correct for your network):\n\nClick Apply and confirm that the button on the left of the interface name (AirPort) switches to green within a few seconds.\nTests\nOnce this configuration is up, open a Terminal and type the following command:\nping 192.168.1.254\n\nto see if you can directly reach your router.\nIf this ping is OK, then the problem is on your router.\nNext chapter depends of this test result.\n\nA: A machine running OS X 10.3 likely has an Airport card that cannot support modern WiFi connections in the 5GHz band, also known as 802.11n.  You may be restricted to WiFi connections in the 2.4GHz band, also know as 802.11b or 802.11g\nYour router should be able to support both bands simultaneously.   You will need to look at your router's configuration and activate 802.11b|g while leaving the 5GHz band (802.11n) active for your more modern devices.\n\nA: While it is no help to the OP I am having similar problems on my modern Retina MacBookPro. Mac's used to be the envy of PC users in their effortless ability to glide from WiFi hotspot to WiFi hotspot, connecting seamlessly at each one, but increasingly I am failing to connect to third party signals, with similar symptoms.\nBasically password is accepted, WiFi signal is strong, but there is no connection to the internet and I end up with a self assigned password, indicating a problem with DHCP handshaking.\nSometimes I can shake the tree by going into Network Preferences and clicking \"Renew DHCP Lease\" on the TCP/IP tab of the Advanced section of WiFi preferences. This forces the Mac to request a new IP address.\nOccasionally I can make it work by entering a manual IP address if I already know the subnet of the router by looking on another computer.\nHowever my point is this - I believe that of late Apple's TCP/IP stack and the WiFi implementation of third party vendors has started to diverge, perhaps over timeout periods, and I think the OP is having the same problem.\nFor $100 he could plug an Apple Airport Express into the U-verse and see if he can connect to that more cleanly?\n", "Q: Is there an application to emulate I'm in a different location? I'm trying to test an iPhone application and I need to simulate I'm in a different location. I was wondering if there is an application out there in the market that let's me write some longitude and latitude so my app can read that location instead of the actual GPS in the phone.\nI don't have access to the code or an iPhone emulator, so I need to test this from the device itself. \nAny possible way to do this?  \n\nA: There's no way to do this in the App Store.

So you can copy the content of your disk with\ncp -pPR /old/path /Volumes/new/path\n\nYou can also avoid using Terminal altogether and just drag the top folder you want to keep onto the external drive in Finder.\n\nA: Download Carbon Copy Cloner 2.3. It is compatible with your version of MacOS X and processor.

I would recommend to use tar instead of cp.\nSomething like this:\ntar cjvf mybackup.tar.bz2 <source>\n\nand then extract the tar file in another location\ntar xjvf mybackup.tar.bz2\n\nTo avoid the temporary file (which may be quite big) you can pipe them together\ncd /path/to/source; tar cf - . | (cd /path/to/dest; tar xpf -)\n\nOf course, if you are backing-up file a filesystem, shared by several users, you may need to do so as a root to overcome permissions problems.\n\nA: Another useful method is to use cpio. It can preserve hard links and can handle some long filenames which are not supported into tar.\nYou can check more details here for a nice comparison between the three techniques.\nI believe all of the methods word, you should just fine that suits your needs and do the job more efficiently.\n", "Q: What is the Applescript command to show or hide iTerm2 window Does anybody know the Applescript command to show or hide a iTerm2 terminal window?

The installation failed with a message stated something about \"no recovery\" and a link to Apple site with Recovery update. I downloaded the update, but it could not run.  Currently, my system is not at the state it was before I started the whole thing.  For example, Safari, Disk Utilities, Startup Disk, Security (firewall setting tool), etc. could not start.  Also, I used to connect to a NAS smb drive, but it does not show up now.

But it requires the use of Disk Utilities to create an external recovery partition but my Disk Utilities currently would not run.\n\nA: Have you attempted to boot into safe mode and run the recovery update in safe mode? \nYou can boot into safe mode by holding down the left shift key. \nFull details here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1455\n\nA: I finally have to reinstall Lion using Internet method after removing all partitions on the hard drive.  With this, Lion will create a recovery partition.  A recovery partition is a requirement for upgrading from Lion to Mountain Lion.  After Lion installed, I was able to upgrade to Mountain Lion without a hitch. \nNot sure if this happened uniquely with my system, I would think the upgrade process should have first checked for this requirement early in the process without starting to overwrite some of the systems components which made the Disk Utility, Safari, etc. un-startable.  \nSo if you happen to do an upgrade, make sure you have a recovery partition on your current drive.

I have learned that WPS is not secure. There is a WPS button on my XFinity modem; but how do I know if it's enabled so I can know if I need to adjust my router settings (or perhaps decline to use an insecure network that I cannot control)?\n\nA: If you simply option click on your Wifi icon on the menubar in OSX you will be rewarded with a wealth of information about the connection. - if you see something you don't like then as Lyken says log into your router and change it after,\n\nOnce you have determined the Security settings for the network you have joined, you can decide to not use it or connect over VPN or perhaps get the administrator of the modem to change the security.\nAlso, there is a Wireless Scan tool built into Mountain Lion and it's called Wireless Disagnostics.\nYou can find it in /System/Library/CoreServices (use the finder's go to folder menu item in the \"go menu\"). Once you open the program, you can choose the utilities window and run a scan of networks to determine their security even before you join them:\n\n\nA: The key thing to know here is that WPS isn't a Wireless protocol to secure a WiFi connection but a protocol to connect a device (e.g. your Mac) to a WiFi router. So instead of selecting the right network and typing the WiFi password into the device you can press a button (either physical or virtual) on both the router and the device and have them figure out the rest themselves.\nThis feature is fairly secure (because both devices get out of WPS mode after a short time even if no connection has been established), but there is also a PIN based method which each certified WPS product must support. This method can be remotely attacked and broken within hours, giving the attacker access to the WPA/WPA keys and the whole network. That's why it's highly recommended to disable the feature, at least after having set up a network.\nIn Apple land WPS isn't used very much because neither OS X nor iOS support it. Airport Utiltiy 6.x allows to add WPS printers that way (with either the button or the PIN method) but that's about as far as support goes.\nComing back to your question: To secure your WiFi network against WPS attacks you must disable the feature on your router/modem (if possible at all). \n", "Q: iPhone 3g won't enter DFU mode I have an iPhone 3g running iOS 4.2.1 with no SIM card. I'm attempting to jailbreak it so I can use it, but it will not enter DFU mode, even though I have tried repeatedly. I am attempting to use redsn0w 0.9.15b3, but my mac should recognize an iPhone in DFU mode anyway, so the jailbreak's probably not the issue.\nThe home button is connected to the board, I opened it up and checked.\nPlease do not just parrot the instructions from the redsn0w jailbreak, as I have already read them many times. I am looking for advice on what may be preventing the iPhone from entering DFU mode. \n\nA: This may seem silly, but this is what I do when I have had to troubleshoot DFU mode (getting in and out of). First cross your fingers that it is software. Do you have a different USB cable that you can try with? Access to another computer to attempt with. I'm sure you have already tried rebooting both the iPhone and Mac, right? Not sure if you know or not, but you actually don't the computer nor the cable to get in DFU. You may want to try without plugging it in as well. The only difficult part with that is since it is not plugged in you will not know when it boots into DFU mode until you plug it in and the computer chimes.

I used iCloud but it said that it has no Wi-Fi. \nHow can I find it now? \n\nA: Use the relevant feature in iCloud to present a message on the screen asking anyone who finds it to call you.\nIf anybody connects it to a wifi network without resetting the device to factory defaults, then they will get the message.\nI would not lock or erase the device remotely, because then they will not be able to connect it to a wifi network.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no way to locate an iPod Touch without it having an internet connection. \n\nA: When you say you've lost it, what do you mean? It's somewhere in your home but you don't know where you put it? You might have left it somewhere? You think someone took it?\nIf it's around your home somewhere, you might get lucky if you have any alarms set — if you've synced your calendar to another device, check the calendar to see if there are any events with audible alarms, then listen carefully at the scheduled time — the device might make a noise revealing its location.\nIf you think it's in your home but it's just not reaching your WiFi signal, you could try moving the base station to different places to see if Find My iPhone works then. It's a long shot, but possible if you happened to sit it down in a corner of your home far from the base station.\nOtherwise, you're probably stuck with the old-fashioned method: Where did you last see it?

I have such issues on other machines with other versions of OSX time to time. Most of them are likely addressed in next versions of OSX.\nI would start with checking Console.app. Various subsystem might log some useful information.\n\nA: Best way to test if it is hardware or software is to use a fresh install. If you have your original CDs that came with the MacBook Pro, or the Snow Leopard upgrade cd, you can install Snow Leopard to an external hard drive and try to reproduce the issue in that second copy of Mac OS X.\nIf it is reproducible, it's hardware, if it won't re-occur, it's software.\nIf it is software, you can do an archive and install of Mac OS X and see if that resolves it. If not, then you may need to reinstall the Operating System completely and copy all your files back on manually.\nIf you want a step by step guide for running an Archive and Install, let me know and I'll write one up for you!\nHonestly though, since this is right after a repair from an Apple Store, if you rule it down to software, go in and ask them to Archive and Install it if you have the time. That way they'll document it, and if it comes back or anything down the track, you can point them at their repair history and get them to cover it since it was documented while in Warranty and immediately after a repair!\nAfter all, checking in a second install only really works if the issue is reliably reproducible.\nLet me know if I can elaborate on anything!\n\nA: You told this happened after you restored your running system from hibernation that was caused by a depleted battery. I suspect this to be the problem. \nThe battery charging status is indirectly measured by the voltage. When nearly drained, Lithium batteries cannot provide the needed current to power all the computers components. This may crash your system as some components fail but it is also possible that it causes memory corruption. This is called a brownout. Additionally this might be caused by Power Management errors. If this continues happening, reset you SMC.\nAround the time this happened the computer began to save the contents of the RAM (and also the VRAM? Please correct me!) to disk and power down the system. In case the memory was already damaged, the hibernation image also contains some garbage. Restoring might cause such symptoms.\n\nA: \nShutdown Cause: -60\n\nThis shutdown code is usually related to bad master directory block (badMDBErr).\nSo you can try to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run First Aid from the Disk Utility to check your HD (or fsck from Safe mode).\n\n*Reset the System Management Controller (SMC).\n\n\nIf above won't help, you are advised to back up your data, erase the disk and reinstall OS X.\nOtherwise, you should take your MBP to repair again, as normally they give you ~21 days if there're some issues with your replaced hardware.\nSee: Are OS X shutdown cause and sleep cause numbers listed/explained anywhere?\nSee also: What is shutdown cause -60?\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete system logs? I'm using DaisyDisk to clean my hard drive and it is showing nearly 8GB of files in /private/var/log/asl. Are those files safe to delete?\n\nA: Yes, you can safely delete log files. In the case of an application needing to write a new entry and the file not being found, it will be re-created automatically.\nJust bear in mind that these ASL (Apple System Log) files may contain some useful information to trace or debug any issues you could be experimenting with your computer, which, of course, will be lost with the deletion of the files. \nSo, in case you might want to take a look at these files before deleting them, you could use the syslog command as follows: syslog -f /private/var/log/asl/nameOfTheFile.asl\n", "Q: DropBox syncing all folders, again? After HDD failure I replaced my iMac HDD and restored Time Machine backup.\nNow dropbox likes to resync all of my files, nearly 1 million of them!\nIs it normal?\n\nA: This issue has come up in the Dropbox forum as well, with the following answer from support:\n\nPause Dropbox, copy the content over. This will cause indexing and the client might even say uploading, but we're not duplicating files in the cloud. Your resync will happen much faster than a re-upload. Just make sure the folder structure remains identical.\n\nIf you did a restore from TM, you should already be past the \"copy the content over\" step and might just see the indexing/uploading step (which shouldn't upload).\n", "Q: Little Snitch rules for power nap? I run Little Snitch to monitor my network traffic. However, on Mountain Lion, power nap runs while my computer is sleeping so I can't approve new rules for Little Snitch to allow power nap to connect to Apple and the App Store. What rules should I add to Little Snitch to allow power nap to operate properly?\n\nA: Power Nap is not an application, it is a set of hardware-level functionality that causes the Mac to wake from sleep, but only with disk, CPU, and networking hardware active - no video or audio. However, third-party applications run as normal during this \"DarkWake\" period (Apple's term). Therefore, Little Snitch should use whatever rules you have in place while the computer is fully awake.\nThis appears to be confirmed by the mention of Power Nap on Little Snitch developer objective development's blog, in an article about Automatic Profile Switching. That functionality found in Little Snitch allows the system to automatically switch rules based on what network your Mac finds itself on. As long as you're on a network that you've previously used, and have rules set up for, Little Snitch should use those same rules during DarkWake. Presumably you allow all of the things that Apple would do during DarkWake when you're actively using your computer (checking email, App Store updates, Photo Stream updates, iCloud document sync, etc.) so the rules already in place should suffice for use during DarkWake.\n", "Q: How can I delete the Time Machine backup files on a Netgear ReadyNAS? I use a Netgear ReadyNAS as a Time Machine server. I recently bought a new Mac, and I want to delete the old backups. How do I delete them? It's not possible from the Time Machine interface.\n\nA: *\n\n*In Finder, click Go => Connect To Server...\n\n*In the Server Address field, type \"afp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\" (IP address) or \"afp://your-ngnas-name.local\"\n\n*Connect using the credentials you use to connect to the Time Machine service.\n\n*Finder will open a window in /Volumes/ReadyNAS. You should see a list Time Machine's .sparsebundle files.\n\n\nAt this point, you can delete a .sparsebundle. It's also possible to Ctrl+Click on a .sparsebundle and select \"Show Package Contents\" to browse inside.\nUPDATE Sometimes files inside the sparsebundle package or the package itself will be locked, preventing deletion. To unlock: Get Info > General > Locked > uncheck.\n", "Q: how to config color when i use iterm2 ssh linux server I use Mac \nand use iterm2 ssh login linux Server\n.\nbut when exec ls \nthe terminal is Black and White\nhow to config then like  mac colors \n\nA: The default TERM type iTerm reports is xterm and that should be sufficient from your Mac's end of things to see colours. The problem is there are two things in play here: your local iTerm terminal and the remote machine and it's shell configuration. If you haven't setup your shell to show colour, it doesn't matter what your iTerm is reporting for TERM.\nIt sounds like the problem is on the remote end and that you haven't configured ls on your Linux system to output colours.\nTry setting LS_COLORS in your environment after you ssh in to your Linux machine. Here is one way to do it:\nexport LS_COLORS='rs=0:di=01;34:ln=01;36:mh=00:pi=40;33:so=01;35:do=01;35:bd=40;33;01:cd=40;33;01:or=40;31;01:mi=01;05;37;41:su=37;41:sg=30;43:ca=30;41:tw=30;42:ow=34;42:st=37;44:ex=01;32'\n\nThat should give you a fairly good chance of ensuring you see colours when you run ls on any directory. If you like the settings, make them permanent by adding that line to your ~/.bash_profile file on the Linux machine.\nYou can also use the newer, more generic, COLORS environment variable and point it to the /etc/DIR_COLORS file that should exist on most modern Linux installations. More tools will key off this than just ls so you'll see colour in tools like grep too. Add the following to your ~/.bash_profile:\nexport COLORS=/etc/DIR_COLORS\n\nto add colours to more tools.\n\nA: Set the Report Terminal Type value to\nxterm-color\n\n", "Q: Using Redsocks on Mountain Lion I'm trying to use redsocks on Mountain Lion for system wide SOCKS proxy.

This support page indicates that the Control key on my PC keyboard should be mapping to Mac's Command key but it does not (e.g. CtrlC/V does not work).  \nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The Control key on your PC keyboard maps to your Mac's Control key.  The Windows key on your PC keyboard maps to your Mac's Command key.\nWhen using a PC keyboard you would use windows keyC to copy and windows keyV to paste, etc.\nYou can set universal keyboard shortcuts in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts > All Applications, you can enter menu values (Save, Copy, Paste, etc) and then assign new key combinations to them.  In the example below I've set controlC to copy and controlU to paste.\n\n\nA: I run into same issue: At work I have to use Windows and at home I use a Mac. I'm sick of having different shortcuts for these basic tasks. Here is my solution for it:\nGo to your User folder on your Mac and open the Library directory.\nHere you create a \"KeyBindings\" folder.\nThen navigate into that folder:\n(Your User folder)/Library/KeyBindings/\nCreate a file \"DefaultKeyBinding.dict\" with following lines:\n\"^v\" = \"paste:\";\n\"^c\" = \"copy:\";\n\"^x\" = \"cut:\";\n\"^z\" = \"undo:\";\n\nSave everything and restart your Mac.\nNow, you will have CTRL + x/c/v/z working like it is on a Windows machine.\nBE AWARE: This will overwrite whatever Apple has configured for these shortcuts. For instance CTRL + v is a standard shortcut for page down, which will not work anymore.\n\nA: I think this is unclear text on the MS site. The text says\n\nthe keyboard shortcuts that you use map to different keys\n\nwhich is not what you read and quoted it as. It means the keyboard short cut you type  in windows maps to a different keyboard shortcut in OSX.\nWhat the text means that instead of typing ctrlc on Windows you type cmdc on OSX\n\nA: Use this software.\nhttps://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/\nIt lets you remap keys on your Mac. I just used it on my Microsoft keyboard and it worked.

I have OS X Server(.app) installed (because I'm a registered developer, so I got it for free).  I figured it would be an easy way to flip a switch and get a web server for some static files, for my own local testing, but I can't seem to make it work.\nThere's a default website with location Default (/Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default), and going to localhost in my browser shows a \"Welcome to Lion Server\" page, so it's definitely running.\nI clicked the \"+\" button, changed the Domain Name to \"*\" (I assume that means \"any\", since it's what the default used), changed the port to 8000 (so it wouldn't collide with the default), changed the location to /Users/ken/Sites (which has a demo index.html file already), and clicked OK.  It spins for a few seconds, the window goes away, and I'm back at the list of sites, and my new site isn't there.\nI'm sure it'd be easier to install my own Apache or nginx through Homebrew at this point, but I'm invested. How do I make this thing work?\nUpdate: I found /etc/apache2/sites/0000_any_8000_.conf, which appears to be exactly the website I created.  I assumed it didn't work since it didn't appear in the Server list of web sites, but going to localhost:8000 actually works! Something is truly weird.\n\nA: You do not need OS X Server to serve basic files. The non \"server\" version of OS X comes with a fully functional apache environment pre-installed. OS X Server is only for more advanced server features which are generally only useful if you're a sysadmin for small business.\nTo enable the pre-installed apache you just go into system preferences -> sharing and tick the box for \"web sharing\". Now apache is running on port 80, available to anyone who can access the mac.\nYou can configure it by editing httpd.conf (for example PHP is installed but disabled - just search for \"php\" in the config file and un-comment it, then restart apache. htaccess files are also disabled by default). Server Fault is the best place to ask questions about editing httpd.conf.\nSince you installed OS X server I suspect you now have two separate copies of apache installed. One configured to run on port 80 (the one in system preferences) and one on port 8000 (the one in os x server).\n", "Q: Undelivered SMS is read in an automated voice A work colleague sent me an SMS that I didn't get.

If you have yet to listen to the entire message, I recommend doing so and seeing if there is an acknowledgement at the end of the call (e.g. \"press pound to acknowledge\"), which may stop the call.\nI bet your problem lies with your colleague's carrier, though.  It is unlikely that either your phone or your own carrier can do much (though the latter may be able to help you block the incoming call.)\n", "Q: iTunes Match hangs at step 2 and does not complete I have been trying to get iTunes Match to work for a week. It keeps getting stuck at Step 2.  To try and fix it I have been stopping and starting Match, sometimes it gets further and other times it doesn't get as far.\nToday I have another problem, when I start iTunes Match it gives this error\n\"We could not complete your iTunes Store request. An unknown error has occurred (4002).\"\nNow I can't start iTunes Match all.  Have to say I am very disappointed with how difficult it is to make this service work.\n-- Edit --\nI left iTunes Match running overnight. This morning iTunes had \"quit unexpectedly\".

Without holding option, click the “Store” Menu Drop down again > \"Turn on iTunes Match”\n\n\nIt should now run as expected. \n\nA: The error just means some kind of network issue connecting to the server. It could be almost anything and perhaps 2 minutes later it will try again and succeed.\nI also just started using iTunes Match and found the progress bar is terrible. For me it was working in the background, but takes a very long time and the status/progress bar is useless - it doesn't tell you what is actually happening.\nI suggest just leaving iTunes running and ignore it.

All of the icons on my iPhone 5 display at 2x, but for some reason, my SchoolsFirst eDeposit icon displays the 1x image. Any idea how I can fix this? I tried deleting/redownloading the app, and hiding it in the \"Purchased Apps\" section of iTunes, and nothing worked.\n\nA: The app probably doesn't have a 2x icon. Apple doesn't allow apps in the store with only 1x, so I assume this app has not been updated in a very long time?\nContact the developer and ask them to fix it. Nothing else you can do, only the developer of an app can modify it (this is a security policy enforced on iOS to prevent malware attacks).\n\nA: This sounds like something that can only be fixed by the author of the app. There is a naming convention that app developers must follow when naming things like the images inside an app bundle. It is possible that the internal name of the image is using the wrong convention, and thus, your iPhone is loading thinking is the higher-res image.

I just bought a used Mac Pro (Mac Pro 1,1). The former user had bought an XFX R6770 replacement card for the NVIDIA 7300 (original) card. He hadn't installed it yet, but assured me that this was the recommended card from a Genius Bar employee.  \nHowever, I installed the card, plugged in the PCI-E power cable, and...nothing. When I open up the Expansion Slot Utility (/System/Library/CoreServices/Expansion Slot Utility.app), it shows that in the first PCI slot, there is an \"ATI VGA-Compatible Controller Card.\"  \nI'm really not a hardware person at all. I'm completely lost. Any suggestions on how to get this card working?\n\nA: Unfortunately, OS X Lion does not have driver support for the XFX R6770 Core Edition video card. You will have to upgrade to OS X Mountain Lion for the graphics card to work.\nSince your MacPro (1,1) is \"officially\" unable to upgrade to Mountain Lion, you will have to \"trick\" your MacPro into thinking it is actually a MacPro(2,1). The reason for this is because a MacPro(2,1) can have Mountain Lion on it.\nTo do this, you will have to follow this guide to change the kernel of your MacPro. I have summarized the procedure of the guide if you prefer, so continue reading.\nBefore Reading: Please look to the links at the bottom, which are links on how to do some of the things mentioned in this guide\nExplanation\nThe first issue (lack of EFI64 on MacPro(1,1)) can be dealt with by using the Chameleon bootloader. Chameleon will emulate EFI64 and therefore load 10.8. Chameleon has to be booted by your Mac as if it were Windows. Apple calls this BIOS emulation “Legacy Boot”. Legacy boot will only boot from internal connectors like the SATA, so no USB or Firewire drives.\nRequirements\nThis will require a spare HDD in addition to the drive that your OS is on.\n\n*\n\n*Download 10.8 From the app store. (you will need to do this on a supported mac)\n\n*Download Xcode from Apple.\n\n*Download Chameleon-2.1svn-r192\n\n*Go into Disk Utility and partition your spare HDD. Click the options button and choose Master Boot Record. Choose two partitions, the first 1GB (named BOOT) and the second can use the remainder of the disk (named Installer). Both partitions are formatted Mac OS Extended Journaled.\n\n*Run the Chameleon installer.\n\n*Change the install location to the BOOT that you created earlier.\n\n*Click Customize here and choose Standard under the Chameleon Bootloader package.\n\n*In Terminal: run sudo bless --folder /Volumes/BOOT --file /Volumes/BOOT/boot --setBoot --legacy\n\n*Download this folder and place it in the root of BOOT.\n\n*Inside, add your serial to the SMBIOS.plist and in org.chamleleon.boot.plist set the default partition to 0,2 which is the installer partition.\n\nNow to the installer.\n\n*\n\n*Locate your 10.8 installer. Right-click and chose ‘show package contents’. Locate InstallESD.DMG in the SharedSupport folder. Double ckick on InstallESD.DMG to mount it.\n\n*Open Terminal and navigate to the Mac OS Install ESD drive. cd /Volumes/Mac\\ OS\\ X\\ Install\\ ESD/ should do it.\n\n*Still in terminal, you need to mount the hidden BaseSystem.DMG type open BaseSystem.DMG and hit enter.\n\n*Now open Disk Utility. Click on BaseSystem.DMG on the left, then click restore, then drag your installer partition into the destination field.\n\n*Click Restore. This will put everything but the packages and kernel on the installer partition. (You may need to rename your installer partition back to “installer” as it may now be called MacOS BaseSystem.)\n\nNext steps are to copy mach_kernel from MacOSInstallESD to the Installer partition.\n\n*\n\n*In Terminal navigate to the Installer ESD with: cd /Volumes/Mac\\ OS\\ X\\ Install\\ ESD then copy mach_kernel to the installer partition with cp mach_kernel /Volumes/Installer/mach_kernel. Have a quick look in terminal to see that it’s there with: cd /Volumes/Installer/ then ls. You should see it there.\n\n*Now in your installer partition there is a system folder, and in that is an installation folder, in there is a packages symlink. Delete it and the copy the packages folder from the MAC OS Install ESD.\n\n*Finally you need to open OSinstall.mpkg with flat package editor which is part of the XCode install.\n\n*Drag Distribution to your desktop and open it in text edit.\n\n*There is a section headed var PlatformSupportValues there is a list of board IDs in speech-marks and separated with commas. like Mac-F42D88C8,Mac-F2218EA9,Mac-F42D86A9 you need to add your mac’s board it to it. This is specified in the smbios.plist in the Extra as Mac-F4208DC8 so if you’re using that smbios.plist then add that value. close TextEdit and go back to the flat package editor. delete Distribution from the package and then drag the one you edited from desktop into flat package editor, then save the package.\n\nThe Ultimate Moment\n\n*\n\n*Now re-boot and hold down Option to bring up the list of drives, choose boot, then franticly tap the up or down arrow key until the Chameleon list of bootable drives appears. Choose Installer.\n\n*(The disk with osx on should be the GUID partition scheme). When the installer has completed, Chameleon will keep trying to boot the installer so edit org.chamleleon.boot.plist.\n\n*Set the default partition  to your Mountain Lion partition. It will probably be 1,2 or 2,2.\n\n*After the installation had completed, I used nano to create an fstab file in /etc. This has two entries in it which stop the boot and Installer mounting when OSX boots so they dont appear in Finder.\nThe entries look like this for each Partition you want to hide:\nUUID=39C933A6-E5A4-3CFB-8841-21C89B0EDF77 none hfs rw,noauto change UUID to the appropriate one.

I went to my music app a while back a deleted some songs I didn't want anymore ( i just went to the song swiped my finger across the screen and the delete button apeared) but now I want them again and I don't know how get them back on my phone with out debuting them? \n\nA: If you bought it on the same Apple ID, then the iTunes on your computer should see that you purchased those songs already. Therefore, you should be able to simply sync music back to iPhone.\nPerhaps I'm not understanding your question though. So I'll cover both sides.\nTransferring Music from iPhone to Computer\nIf you purchased songs and you bought them on the same Apple ID, you can simply transfer purchases back onto your iPhone. See the picture below.\nJust go to File => Devices => Transfer Purchases\n\nTransferring Music from Computer to iPhone\nFirst of all, you can see what content you purchased (make sure you sign in to the iTunes store first). Take a look at the picture below. You should see it under the Quick Links section:\n\nHowever, to automatically transfer these purchases from the computer to the iPhone, you need to follow these instructions:\nOn the iPhone Side:\nYou need to use Automatic Downloads. Make sure it's on by following the directions in the picture below.\n\nOn the Computer Side:\nMake sure that iTunes has the preference that is mentioned in this picture enabled.\n\n\nA: There's a purchased section on the iTunes app. If you tap it you can view the song you have purchased.\n", "Q: OS X - Is there a way to switch keyboard input languages using keyboard shortcut? Rather self explanatory, but I was hoping to be able to quickly change input languages, without going up to the top and switching manually, rather with a keyboard input? Maybe I'm just too lazy, but I was wondering if this was possible?\n\nA: The default keyboard shortcut is \n⌘ + space\n\nIf you have an application already using this keyboard shortcut it will be disabled. you can check in your keyboard input settings. \n\nJust select them and if it brings up a warning change them by double clicking on the listed shortcut. \n", "Q: Unable to transfer files from external hard drive Problem:\nI'm trying to transfer about 168 GB of files from an old Windows XP machine to a newer MacBook Pro running OS X 10.6.8.\nI successfully copied the files from the XP machine onto a 2TB Seagate drive, formatted as NTFS.\nI opened the Seagate drive on the Mac and started copying the files. Though the drive is read-only because it is NTFS, all I need to do is copy files off of it.\nAbout 15% into the transfer, a message pops up saying \"The operation can’t be completed because an unexpected error occurred. (Error -8084)\" and the transfer stops. This has happened multiple times.\nWhat I've tried to fix the problem:\nI tried transferring one of the sub-folders of the backup, also resulting in an error, though this one was different. It was something like: \"The process has been stopped because a file is in use.\" It then said the name of the file. I tried this second process twice; each time it gave a different file name.\nIn both cases, some of the files transfer properly, but most don't.\nI have tried disabling Spotlight for the drive, but that didn't help.\n\nA: Even reading with NTFS can be an issue with the OS X system. Assuming you don't have any individual files that are greater than or equal to 4GB, I would switch to a more OS X - compatible format like FAT32. This is both readable and writeable to/from OS X and Windows systems. I would reformat the drive to be FAT32, retransfer your data, and then try the transfer onto the OS X system. \n", "Q: Is there a hidden preference to get Mission Control to show application icons when grouping is turned off?

The DVD was bootable and I verified with Parallels that it was indeed so.\nMac mini server 2012, 2x1 TB, Apple DVD drive connected to Thunderbolt display.\n\nA: Turns out when I connected the DVD drive directly to the Mac mini it could boot with no problems.\nApparently Thunderbolt cannot be used for booting, at least not for non-network booting.\nNote that I also tried to let Boot Camp Assistant create a bootable USB stick which utterly failed and took hours to do so. Safest bet appears to be a bootable DVD and a DVD drive connected directly to the Mac.\n", "Q: Why are Mac files able to have multiple owners? Regarding Unix file permissions, which Macs use, why are Mac files in particular able to have multiple owners? For instance, you can view the \"Get info\" panel of a file, and under the Permissions section at the bottom, add another owner by clicking on the plus sign \"+\".\nHow does this work? I don't think vanilla Unix is able to do this?\n\nA: You are right, vanilla Unix doesn't support this. But there is this thing called ACL (Access Control Lists) which allows for a much more granular definition of access rights than the usual user/group/world rights. From Wikipedia:\n\nMost of the Unix and Unix-like operating systems (e.g. Linux, BSD, or Solaris) support POSIX.1e ACLs, based on an early POSIX draft that was abandoned. Many of them, for example AIX, FreeBSD, Mac OS X beginning with version 10.4 (\"Tiger\"), or Solaris with ZFS filesystem, support NFSv4 ACLs, which are part of the NFSv4 standard.\n\nBy default every file only has the user/group/world rights\n\npse@Fourecks:~/Downloads$ ls -le UML_Plakat_8_2012_Web-Download_V1.pdf \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 pse  staff  4914537 Jun 21 09:56 UML_Plakat_8_2012_Web-Download_V1.pdf\n\nIf you now add an additional owner\n\nFinder automatically creates a corresponding ACL entry for this:\npse@Fourecks:~/Downloads$ ls -le UML_Plakat_8_2012_Web-Download_V1.pdf \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 pse  staff  4914537 Jun 21 09:56 UML_Plakat_8_2012_Web-Download_V1.pdf\n 0: user:jonnyenglish allow read,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\n\nYou can also modify ACL entries directly from Terminal by using chmod (which gives you significantly more details to manipulate than the Get Info dialog in Finder). For details it's probably best to run man chmod in Terminal and read the ACL MANIPULATION OPTIONS section.\n", "Q: I can't see usb-drives and archives in the sidebar of the finder anymore When I plugin a usb-drive or open dmg-archives they don't appear under the 'Devices' section in the sidebar of the Finder anymore.\nThe drives are there when I check with 'Disk Utility', they appear on the Desktop and I can browse the files if I go to /Volumes.\nI have 'Hard disks' and 'External disks' checked in the Finder preferences -> Sidebar tab.\nAny ideas on how to get them to show up in the sidebar?\nI'm using MacOS Lion 10.7.5.\n\nA: In your Finder sidebar, can you see your internal hard drive listed under Devices?

I still don't see the hard drive in \"Finder\" sidebar, but I'm figuring that's just the way it is with Lion?  I adjusted the Finder Preferences so I can now see the HD and other drives on my desktop...\n\nA: I am on Mojave and nothing of the above worked for me.\nIn order to have the disk images appear in the sidebar when opening a DMG file, I deleted the preferences of finder in :~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist \nand sidebar (same folder, file com.apple.sidebarlists.plist). \nPlease note that I had various com.apple.finder.plist files, with the base-name completed by random alphanumeric sequences: com.apple.finder.plist.QNHART6 and alike.

I've got an external hard drive which I've hooked up to time machine, I have multiple Mac's but the one in question I am unable to remember the administrator password, which is a pain when trying to create an extra user account and install software, etc.\nWhat should I do in this situation? What's the best way of keeping all my files and existing software but be able to start up with a new user.\nPS: Worst case scenario is to restore the iMac  and getting all my files back, ncluding Microsoft Office (if I am correct Time Machine will automatically back up software as well?) but is there a way of setting up the mac once restored through TM keeping all the files but not the user profile. \n\nA: You can restart the Setup Assistant by performing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Single User Mode ⌘ + S.\n\n*Mount the drive by typing /sbin/mount -uw / then ↩ enter.\n\n*Remove the Apple Setup Done file by typing rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone then ↩ enter.\n\n*Reboot by typing reboot then ↩ enter.\n\n*Continue setup, making sure not to transfer data.\n\n*Setup a new administrator account. You can use this account to reset the password to the original account (through System Preferences → Users & Groups).\n\nThe new account can then be deleted once the original account has been recovered.\n\nA: If you want to reset the administrator's password, the method given here should allow you to do so. Be sure to expand the section that says \"Resetting the original administrator account password\"; the part at the top that says \"Resetting a user's password in OS X Lion and Mountain Lion\" will most likely do you no good, since you forgot the passwords for all administrators.\nThe steps in the \"Resetting the original administrator account password\" section does not require that you know an admin's password, and so you should able to follow these steps. In newer Macs (those released in the past three years or so), your Mac should already have a \"Recovery partition\", so inserting a DVD is not even necessary. Just start your Mac up and hold the keys \"cmd\" and \"R\" together, until you enter Recovery Mode. From there, you can follow the steps on the page.\n\nA: If you have an older Mac that came with an installer DVD then you can use that. Insert the DVD and restart your Mac. After the chime hold down the C key on the keyboard until you see the grey screen with the spinning icon. After an eternity you'll be presented with options to install etc but choose Reset Password (I think it's from the Apple Menu). You can then enter a new password and restart.\n", "Q: How to see whole network on a mac? I am new to the apple world and finding out some \"how to stuff\". One of the things I am looking for is the Microsoft equivalent of the \"network center\".\nEverything works on my mac network-wise. However, I would like to see all devices in the network. For instance all my Sonos devices. If something is not working I was used to quickly open the network overview in Windows and see whether all devices where at least visible in the network.\nHow do I do this on a Mac? \n\nA: In Finder, go to the highest level available by repeatedly pressing Command-Up, or by right clicking the current folder name in the title bar and selecting the bottom entry.\nFrom this location (called \"Arnoud's Macbook Pro\" or something), you should see a folder called \"Network.\" This will show you a variety of network shares.\nTo see every device advertising itself on the network, check out Bonjour Browser, which will display all registered zeroconf devices.\n\nA: Provided you're on the network already, just open a Finder window and look under SHARED on the left pane. All computers on your subnet should show up there, provided they have sharing turned on on their computers.\nDepending on your servers and stuff you might need to configure them to enable AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) or SMB (Server Message Block).\nIn some odd cases the firewall can block other devices, so try turning it off if the above doesn't work\n", "Q: Remove VIP mail box from sidebar in Mac Mail I accidentally set one of my contacts to be a VIP in Mac Mail, it then added this folder in the image below into the sidebar, when i removed the VIP status of that contact the VIP folder still remained in the sidebar.. any idea how i can remove it ?\n\n\nA: I found what worked was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all VIP contacts\n\n*Close Mail\n\n*Reboot the machine\n\n\nUpon reopening Mail, the VIP section in the sidebar is now gone. \nUPDATE - At the time of writing this initial post i was running OSX 10.9.\n\nA: Got this working in OS X 10.10, Yosemite:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Mail.app.\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/.\n\n*Edit VIPSenders.plist and remove all the senders.\n\n*Save the file.\n\n*Select the file and press Command + i to see information about the file.\n\n*Check Locked under general info.\n\n*Reopen Mail.app.\n\n\nA: OS 10.11.6 Open the email in the VIPS folder.

I apologise in advance since this will be a long question. I hope that somebody with applescript knowledge can help me. I am transferring whole of my Windows machines to Apple and I am stuck with one last little annoying thing. Within Outlook I had a macro running that asked me where to file a mail after sending it. I am used to file projects in separate folders and have the incoming and outgoing mail there together. Most of the items I send BTW go into the trash folder. In other words, my sent items folders is always empty.\nFor reference purposes I attach the original macro below.\nI tried this through rules but now understand that Mail does not support rules on sent items. Then I ended up with the automator and applescript. I have found some examples on the internet that move selected mails to a specific (preset) folder. That is however not what I need, I need the script to ask me every time what folder to use.\nThe next thing I cannot found is some kind of automatic trigger when I send a mail. It would for instance be possible through an option \"when a mail gets stored in sent mail\". Or something similar. The next best thing is just a key board shortcut that starts the macro although this is pretty close to doing it manually by just moving sent mail to a specific folder.\nAnyway, I hope my question is clear and some intelligent applescript guru amongst you has a way to deal with this.\nThanks in advance!\nArnoud\n\nCOPY OF MY ORIGINAL VBA CODE USED ON THE WINDOWS OUTLOOK SETUP\nDim objFolder As MAPIFolder\n\n ' Variable declaration\n Dim objNS As NameSpace\n Dim colKeywords As New Collection\n Dim vntRecipients As Variant\n Dim bolExternalEmail As Boolean\n\n ' Set variables\n Set objNS = Application.GetNamespace(\"MAPI\")\n\n ' Set up list of keywords that you use when attaching files\n colKeywords.Add \"attachement\"\n colKeywords.Add \"Attachement\"\n colKeywords.Add \"attached\"\n colKeywords.Add \"Attached\"\n\n ' Check for attechment keywords and check for number of attachments\n If checkForKeywords(colKeywords, Item.Body) And (Item.Attachments.Count = 0) Then\n\n ' If attachments should be in email ask for continue\n If MsgBox(\"Attachement missing.

I understand that when a Mac's EFI system runs, it locates the file boot.efi in the /System/Library/CoreServices/ (blessed) directory and runs this as an EFI application (subverting a large part of the UEFI specification if my understanding is correct).\nMy question is: what does this EFI application actually do on 10.8.4? I figure it must locate the kernel, pass through boot arguments, locate KEXTs, etc, but that is just my speculation. Is there anywhere I can find out what it does (ideally step-by-step) from a concrete source? \n\nA: EFI is a contract that specifies how the hardware can find and start the software and vice versa.\nRather than have to build custom code into each new hardware device and each new software release - a standard was agreed upon and the specification was initially written by Intel.\nThen a company like Apple decides to adopt a certain version of the EFI specification (perhaps even using specific implementations of the spec in hardware - either making it's own chips or adopting another company's implementation) and possibly extends/modifies the base implementation to meet Apple's needs.\nFrom a high level, boot.efi is part of the software end of things that help shepard the hardware boot and handoff to the OS to let it run (in this case OS X 10.8.4):\n\nThe wikipedia article below is the source of the above image, as well as contains some good introductory details on EFI and Apple's use of it since 2006. Apple covers more details about their implementation of EFI and the boot process in the kernel programming guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Firmware_Interface\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/booting/booting.html\n", "Q: How can I display my ipad screen on my PC? My company has several ipads standing in public places around town running our app. Sometimes the app crash and I have to go out to reboot it. Is there a way where I can sit in my office and log on to the ipads to check that the app is running? \n\nA: if you had an iPad 2 or above, you could use Airplay Mirroring, and then setup an airplay server on your Mac which will allow you to receive a live video feed of the current display.\nSee this answer, which is actually from a question about recording iPad screen output, which has most of the technical details.\nIt's not quite the same as \"logging in\" to your iPad, but the end result is the same.  The difficulty you will probably hit is in being on the same LAN which is a requirement of Airplay, but you could perhaps fix this with VPNs.\n\nA: Yes - you could use one of the well known MDM solutions and their free companion app to direct several iPads to run one app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Casper Focus\n\n*http://www.jamfsoftware.com/products/casper-focus\nI believe their free trial would let you get a cloud instance of the JSS set up and you could test on a few iPads to make sure the tool does what you need, but this is an amazing suite and might make financial sense based on how many calls you make and what your hourly rate is for managing the devices, wiping them, configuring them, tracking them, etc...\n", "Q: Connecting to one Mac from another shows shared drives that no longer exsist When I connect to my Mac Mini from my MacBook Pro (both 10.6.8) as a registered user, I see sharepoint that no longer physically exsist. How do I delete these entries? \n\nA: On the Mac Mini, you will want to open up the Sharing Preference Pane and go ahead and delete all the shares that you wish to no longer have listed.\nThe changes should be immediate, but I suppose the other computer that connects to the shares might need to log out and in if you are still seeing phantom entries.\nAlso, there is a slight case your Airport hardware is proxying these shares in case the Mini goes to sleep, so you might want to just shut down the Mini, then the router and finally the MacBook if you can't get these entries to clear.\n", "Q: What are launchd's LaunchAgents directories for? I created some job plist files and put them in ~/Library/LaunchAgents. Now I don't see the point of this special directory (see launchd manpage). When I want to load a job, I have to specify a whole path to a plist file. Or can I somehow restart launchd so that it reads those files again?\n\nA: Depending on the key Disabled the job definitions in ~/Library/LaunchAgents will be loaded automatically by launchd whenever the user logs in.\n", "Q: Can I Connect to a Local SMB Share? When attempting to connect to smb://localhost/share, I receive an error that I ought to access the files locally. This is not always desirable. For example, this means I can not use my portable home on my Mac Mini that is serving the home directory.\nWindows (via native SMB/CIFS) and other *nix systems (via Samba) can access local shares just fine. Why can I not do so on OS X?\n\nA: According this this link it is possible:\nhttps://www.chrisnewland.com/solved-mac-osx-samba-cifs-through-ssh-tunnel-error-the-server-localhost-is-available-on-your-computer-364\n\nFinder identifies smb://127.0.0.1 as a local filesystem and refuses\n  to mount port 445 even if you've set up an SSH tunnel using \n-L 445:localhost:445 \n\nThe solution is to alias your lo0 interface to\n     127.0.0.2 and Finder doesn't see this as a local address. \nsudo ifconfig lo0 127.0.0.2 alias up \n\nCreate the ssh tunnel and map to your    Samba / CIFS server \nssh user@remote -L 127.0.0.2:445:smbhost:445 \n\nNow you can open the share in Finder \nsmb://user@127.0.0.2\n\n\n\nA: Of course is difficult to give an answer without details such as OS X version, type of networking and so on.\nGenerally though, I experienced that by restarting File Sharing (by deselecting/selecting the checkbox from the Sharing Preference Pane) solves several issues, such as Windows machines not being able to connect to Mac shares. This issue was due to a race condition in OS X (that in 10.8.5 seems to be still not resolved) where the smb service starts before an auth service, causing it to fail when other computers try to access shared folders with any sort of privileges.\nAre you trying to connect to network shares with CMD+K ? It generally works, otherwise if you click Browse you can see all the attached devices an their shares.\n\nA: I have since found that accessing SMB shares from localhost simply isn't supported. However, I have no single authoritative documentation to cite here, but suffice it to say it cannot be done (natively).\nMore to the point, it is not supported to log on with a mobile account onto the server hosting the home shares - you should only use local accounts. \n", "Q: Tethering: Tell iPad to treat Wifi connection as mobile data? I am regularily tethering from my phone to my iPad. Basically this works fine -- except that, being on wifi, the iPad or various apps treat the data connection as if it was a flatrate. The same would probably apply when being in places, that apply a narrow data usage limit to their connections.\nIs there some way to tell and iPad (mini) to consider certain Wifi networks as mobile data connection?\nUpdate: I strongly prefer non-jailbreak solutions. if you know a jailbreak-only solution, please still state it for completeness, but I probably will not use it. \n\nA: I know from personal experience as an iOS developer and having researched this topic before that it is not possible.\nIf the developer was savvy enough they can write code that differentiates a tethered connection from real Wifi.\nThat, however, would be app specific and furthermore unfortunately there is no blanket setting.\n\nA: Not easily. Jailbreaking would allow various options for on-phone fire walling but that could get complicated pretty quickly. \nThere are proxy or vpn services like Onavo that could lead to a solution, but I've not known any that allow you to selectively limit your outbound traffic. These types of service basically route all your network traffic through their servers. Generally done for traffic measurement or security or anonymity. It would be technically feasible to then block some traffic. \nSetting up your own proxy or vpn server and then configure outbound limits would be possible, but again, not easy.\n", "Q: Does Mail.app support Exchange \"categories\" on emails? I've got a team who are all running Outlook on Windows to log into a shared inbox and use \"Categories\" to delegate incoming work.\nA new team member wants to use her Mac, running Mail.app.  I had no problem getting the account set up, but the Category markings are not visible anywhere in Mail.app.  (Flags are, read/unread are, folder structure is, just not Categories.)\nIs there a visibility setting somewhere that I'm missing?  Or will I need to get Office Business for Mac so she can do this work in Outlook?\n\nA: Mail.app has no categories, but the Outlook 2011 on Mac has.\nAlso making Mail communicate with Exchange server is tricky, however Outlook 2011 will do that.\nSo she can still use her mac with Outlook for work, and mail for all other emails.\n\nA: It appears as if MailTags3 supports categories synchronisation.

Contact the software manufacturer for assistance.\n\nI'm somewhat out of warranty now so taking it back to Apple sadly isn't an option.\n\nSide Note: I was unable to format the new hard disk using disk utility from the 10.6 or 10.8 installers so I connected it to another mac via a USB cradle to format (went fine). The Hard Drive is brand new and shows up as SMART verified.\n\nA: The Genius Bar will reinstall your OS and/or diagnose any potential hardware problems at no charge regardless of warranty status.  The only time they will require a fee is if your Mac is indeed out of warranty and requires a hardware repair, at which time you would need to pay in order to have the repair performed.\nIf visiting an Apple store is an option for you then by all means don't let your warranty status stop you from visiting.  They should be able to install 10.6 since it came with your Mac and/or 10.8 if you can show proof of purchase for it.\nFor the actual question, you can view the log file while performing the installation under either File > View Log or View > Log, I don't have an install in progress at the moment to reference.

How can I set it to open in a different window size? \n\nA: The easiest way to have iTerm2 open with a specific size, position and number of windows is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get it all set up the way you'd like to see it when it opens. Have all your iTerm2 windows sized and place where you like them.\n\n*From the top menu select Window -> Save Window Arrangement and give it a name\n\n*Go to the Preferences and under the Arrangements section find the named arrangement, select it and press the Set Default button\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the General page and select Open default window arrangement\n\nNow, when you start iTerm2, it'll use your saved arrangement to place, size and create the number of windows you saved.

'Permission denied' messages from a number of internal files and folders were a recurrent theme whenever I did a find operation on that folder. But chmod -R seems to have failed here. Can someone please explain why I get this error message and what I should do to fix it? I'm on OS X 10.8.3.\n$ sudo chmod -R a+r /private/etc\nsudo: /private/etc/sudoers is mode 0444, should be 0440\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\n\nIn fact any read operation in the directory seems to fail:\n$sudo stat /private/etc/raddb/sql/sqlite \nsudo: /private/etc/sudoers is mode 0444, should be 0440\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\n\n\nA: Changing the permissions on /private/etc/sudoers is definitely a no-no. The sudo command will fail to work if that file's permissions are not 0440 as you are noticing. This is a security measure -- the command distrusts any permission setting that is less restrictive than 0440 as it allows for potential tampering with sudo permissions on the box.\nNormally you'd boot in to single user mode to fix this problem. This lets you log in with elevated privledges so you can do a:\nchmod 440 /private/etc/sudoers\n\nand get your sudo command back.\nBut I found this article that had an alternative that doesn't require a reboot and works if your account has Administrator level access. I haven't tried it, but it seems sound.\nOpen a Finder window a hit Shift-Command-G to get the \"Go To\" dialog. Enter /private/etc in the dialog and hit the Go button.\nFind the sudoers file in the Finder window, select it and press Command-I to open the information window for the file and change the permissions on the file so they match:\n\nClose the information window and you should be back in business.\nAll this being said: I would strongly encourage you to rethink changing the permissions of everything under /private/etc to be world readable. This poses a serious security risk (as seen from the way sudo locks you out when you make /private/etc/sudoers world readable) to your machine. Maybe there's another Ask Different question here that'll help you solve a problem you think you're solving by making these unsafe changes?\n", "Q: European Time capsule in Canada Is it possible to use a (European/French)Time Capsule in Canada ?\nIf yes, is there any particular configuration to apply ?\nThank You.\n\nA: Yes, from my experience you can do that.

If you receive an alert stating that the Trash cannot be emptied \"because the item Cache.db is in use,\" then terminate the helpd process using Activity Monitor.

Note that Help Center logging will write a lot to the console.log.\nEdit your question and include the relevant outputs of console.log.\n\n\nUpdate\nSteve, I'm including this as an update because it would have been too long as a comment.\n\n*\n\n*Do you have the OS X installer dmg for Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion? If yes, you could use Pacifist to extract files that are necessary for Help Center. (By \"clean re-install\", do you mean you wiped your computer and reinstalled the OS?)\n\n\n*In  regards to the console.log, the event.layerX and event.layerY has to do with jQuery for a web browser (Chrome I think?).

The first few lines:\n Could not find access page in directory /Applications/Debut.app/Contents/Resources/help 21/08/13 5:23:29.343 PM helpd[643]\n\nmean that the .help files are missing in your applications (Debut and SketchbookExpress).\nThis is the best link I can find in regards to Help Center, although it is deprecated and meant for older versions (This is where I got the steps to reset Help Center. I've went through it already but take another look.\n\nHelp books are installed in one of two ways:\n1. Directly in the Macintosh HD > Library > Documentation > Help folder.\n2.

I have a drive from an old Windows computer. The drive is now in an enclosure, so it's accessible as if it were an external drive. It is formatted as NTFS. I would like to convert this drive (about 50 GB, including Windows XP on it) to a writable disk image.\nI tried using Disk Utility to convert it to a read/write disk image, but it doesn't work because it still results in a disk image with NTFS as the format, which Mac cannot write to natively.\nSo, how can I convert the NTFS disk image that I now have (or the original drive) to a writable disk image? This will probably require that it be converted from NTFS to FAT32 or HFS+ somehow. I could just take the basic approach and copy the files themselves, but is there a cleaner way by copying it as an image?\n\nA: Alright, so after browsing around, I figured that I could just Carbon Copy Cloner to copy the NTFS's contents to a proper sparse bundle or sparse image.

I'd like to remove the \"Never\" option and some of the longer options for all accounts on the system. Essentially I'd like to require a screensaver, any screensaver. \nIs there a way that this can be accomplished?\n\nA: If you're using Open Directory and OS X Server, you can push manifests to the client machines using Workgroup Manager (MCX). This, of course, depends on what version of OS X Server you are using. My familiarity is with Lion Server, but documentation exists for MCX and Directory Services in other OS X Server versions.\nWhile I am not sure you can eliminate the options for screensaver timing, you can force the client machine into a specific value using the plist and MCX.\nHelpful Links:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Manage Settings Using the Preference Editor\n\n*This link is for Leopard, but it is relevant to how OS X Server and MCX handle screensaver settings.\n\n\nA: If you're looking for a way to set this for a newly provisioned OSX machine, you can use Pivotal Labs' pivotal_workstation::set_screensaver_preferences recipe included in the sprout-wrap project.\nThis project provides an easy way to configure an OSX machine with OpsCode's chef-solo and the soloist gem.\nEasiest way to start: solowizard.com\nTo enforce a configuration, you could run soloist as a cron job\n\nA: Something similar I've done in the past is write an application that runs via the system launchd, which checks the value of the current user's \"askForPasswordDelay\" variable (for the screen lock), and if it is set to too long a value, then adjust it back, along with displaying a window regarding the company's security policies.\nIt doesn't prevent the setting of \"never\"; but, when it is detected, it fixes it.\n", "Q: photostream with no iphone I no longer have my iPhone, but I wanted to know if there was anyway I could access the pictures that I uploaded to Photostream before I got rid of the phone.

Once installed, open iCloud Control Panel and enter the same Apple ID and password as you used on your iPhone. Any photos taken within the last 30 days (or up to 1000, whichever limit was hit first) will be downloaded.\nIf you're on Mac, have OS X v10.7.3 or later, and have iPhoto '11 (v9.2 or later), go to System Preferences > iCloud and again, sign in with the same Apple ID and password as your iPhone.

If I want a read/write disk image, then aren't sparse bundle disk images always the way to go? They start at 0 kb in size, and grow to accommodate whatever you add to them, and if you delete stuff, they don't shrink automatically, but you can run a command to shrink them manually to regain space.\nSo what advantages does a writable .dmg have against a writable .sparsebundle or .sparseimage?\n\nA: From this blog post:\n\nA customized .sparseimage file can be made larger than the total capacity of the physical volume on which it originally resides.  While the sparse image volume will seem to make that capacity available, attempting to exceed the physical capacity of the underlying volume will result in a disk error: \"ran out of space.\"\n\nA couple of other disadvantages of a sparse bundle:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since it's actually a directory containing multiple files, it can't be attached to an email, sent with DropSend, etc. You would have to compress it into an archive first (eg. Zip).\n\n*It's only supported from OS X 10.5 (Leopard) onwards, so if you have an old Mac running 10.4 or earlier, you won't be able to open sparse bundles created on newer Macs.\n", "Q: Is there any way to backup and restore your iOS apps *without* re-downloading all of them? I've got a problem. The first step, as they say, is acceptance. My problem, is apps.\nI've got over four hundred on my phone, generally. It floats around that count, anyway. I think, perhaps, it comes from when I was a Boy Scout: “be prepared, zing-zing bong-bong,” and all that.\nBut in all seriousness: waiting two or three days, without leaving WiFi range (meaning, since I travel a lot, two or three days being phone-less while it sits at home) for all of my apps to re-download themselves … is painful, at best; and lifestyle-restricting at worst.\nI'm a techie. I know quite a bit about these things, generally; and I know that there must be some way, complex as it may be, to backup the actual .app folders and restore the same, without excruciatingly-slowly re-downloading dozens of gigabytes of apps every single time I drop my phone, or update to a new iOS beta, or suffer some other data-calamity.\nAnybody know?\n\nA: You can backup the iphone from itunes from a mac/windows pc and the when you need to restore choose to restore from an itunes backup.\n\nA: Thanks to @JashJacob and @HelpingHand for the obvious, although not to me (since I haven't used iTunes in years), answer:\niTunes can, when set up to sync with a given phone, sync just the applications down from the phone. They can then be synced back to a new phone, again with the same iTunes instance.\n\nA: Absolutely no need to waste your time re-downloading the apps via WiFi. Simply transfer all app files to iTunes on your PC or mac. \nThen back up the iPhone with iTunes. \nThe next time you need to restore your apps and app data to the iPhone, simply restore from the iTunes backup and sync the iPhone with iTunes. All apps and app data will be restored. The app files themselves are backed up to your \"Mobile Applications\" folder in the \"iTunes Media\" folder - so absolutely no need for re-downloading the apps.\n\nA: You could use iFunbox to save all your apps individually or you could use iTunes to sync all your apps at once\n", "Q: How to ensure that Mac in network always remains connected to local Mac?

I find that I desperately NEED Safari to ask me where I would like something saved (and allow me to rename it) (you know.. a Save As dialog) before it is downloaded - on an individual, download by download basis.  This MUST be the default action for downloading a file; Modifier keys and right-clicks are unacceptable.\nSafari does not appear to have this option available to me.\nSo, I am open to suggestions.  Is there a way to do this with Automator?  Is there a file system trick to accomplish this?  Safari Extension?  Anything? \nPerhaps an http/s proxy program that accomplishes this?\n\nA: You can hold down the control key or click with your right mouse button and select save as... \nBut I must admit that doesn't work always because some downloads aren't clicked on.\nI personally dislike this solution because you have to click more ( but save as already gives you more to click then needed in my opinion ;) )\nYou can do this with this workaround using automator:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Automator tool\n  \n*Create a new \"Folder Action\" type document.\n  \n*Assign the Folder Action to the Downloads folder.\n  \n*Add these actions (in order): Move Finder Items, Reveal Finder Items,\n  Name Single Item.\n  \n*Set the \"Move Finder Items\" action to use the Downloads folder as it's\n  default (or whichever folder you are most likely to move things to - I\n  use Downloads because most of the time I'm moving files into an\n  archive structure and want it to be easy to skip this process by just\n  hitting Return and leaving the file in Downloads when I don't do\n  that.)\n  \n*Open the options for the \"Move Finder Items\" action and tick the\n  checkbox for \"Show this action when the workflow runs.\"\n  \n*Open the options for the \"Name Single Item\" action and tick the\n  checkbox for \"Show this action when the workflow runs.\"\n\nAs quoted from: https://superuser.com/questions/201298/to-prompt-a-folder-location-when-safari-downloads-a-file\n", "Q: Reboot from the command line (stuck processes) I started a remote reboot of my machine but a couple of stuck processes are hanging the reboot.\n\n\n*\n\n*login with SSH is still possible\n\n*sudo reboot or sudo shutdown -r hang\n\n*two processes are trying to exit\nUSER             PID  PPID  PGID   SESS JOBC STAT   TT       TIME COMMAND\nroot              43     1    43      0    0 ?Es    ??    0:00.00 (mds)\ncorti            407   376   407      0    1 ?E     ??    0:00.00 (talagent)\n\n\n*I did not manage to kill them (i.e., sudo kill -9 43 or sudo kill -9 407 have not effect)\n\n*A remote desktop session is no more possible (last screen that I got was a gray screen with the wheel while shutting down)\n\n*Trying to reboot without flushing the caches does also hang (any combination of -n and -q)\n\n\nAny other things I could try other than going home and physically reboot the machine?\n\nA: If you can't kill something with -9, and sudo reboot doesn't work, you're pretty much out of options. The process is deadlocked in a manner that has prevented the OS from shutting down.\nHave you closed all other Windowed applications? talagent is apparently the process that manages Resume, your guess is as good as mine in determining why it's deadlocked; Errors communicating with a process it was trying to save before closing, disk errors, etc. Since it's attempting to exit, it's unlikely that anything else (forcing system sleep, closing the process it was waiting on) will cause this process to work out it's lock.\nThe power button is necessary at this point.\n", "Q: Some playlists are missing from iTunes Match I've just subscribed for iTunes Match and it did quite a good job of matching stuff except that three of my playlists are missing from it. That three missing playlists only show up on my iMac which is my source Mac for my entertainment.\nI tried duplicating and renaming those three missing playlists with no luck.\n\nA: I had the same problem: smart playlist hidden on the iPhone, but fixed playlist (not the smart ones) correctly synchronized.\nIn my smart playlist, i put a condition like \"playlist not 'xxx'\".  While working on my pc, where the xxx playlist contains already downloaded files, it did not work on the iPhone, because the mobile has no clue how to handle the request.\nI changed the playlist, and deleted the dependancy between other playlist, and... tadam... I saw the smart playlist happear on the iPhone.\nI hope it will help.\nHans\n\nA: *\n\n*Turn on the iCloud Download and iCloud Status columns in iTunes, using View > Show View Options (on a Mac).  Look for items with problems: for example, voice memos, which can't be uploaded to iTunes Match.\n\n*If step 1 doesn't reveal any problems, try turning off iTunes Match (via Store > Turn Off iTunes Match), then turn it on again.\n\n\nA: Even though Ashley's solution solved it for a while the problem happened again therefore I tried her solution again. But it didn't stop. It happened again.\nToday, it came to my mind out of nowhere that some playlist not syncing while some others were successfully syncing might be due to the ineligible songs in those not syncing playlists. And that seems to be the case.\nI removed all of the ineligible songs from those playlists and they instantly showed up on my other devices.\nIn order to show the ineligible songs in your iTunes, you have to click the header of the songs view in your library and select iCloud status. Selecting this will add an additional column about each of your songs' iTunes Match status.\nThis seems like a bug in iTunes Match since it can sync playlists with ineligible songs at first but not afterwards.\n\nA: I've been trying to find an answer to this for a week (since Music Match got a mind of its own).  Quite by accident, I went to the \"More\" section of the Music app on my iPhone 5 (with iOS7).  The last choice is \"Shared\".  There I found a choice between my iPhone and my Library (on my Mac).  I switched from my iPhone to my Library and -- voila -- my playlists showed up on my iPhone.  There are still 34 songs missing on my iPhone.  But, I think they are from 6 albums that also don't show up.  I am not in the mood to do a complete reconciliation.  I will leave well enough alone.  \n\nA: I had this same issue, It turned out to be the songs that I was missing were mis-categorized as audiobooks and they were in my audiobook section in the Books tab.\n\nA: I've just discovered what I THINK happened to my missing playlists. What was happening was that 2 of my playlists weren't syncing, and even if I made a new copy of them (I was trying anything at this point) they still wouldn't sync. So I tried turning off/on iTunes Match again. It then authorized my computer again. However, when it came back on, while it was syncing information to the cloud I discovered that there were a few songs on each playlist that were \"unchecked\" (I have no idea why or how they got that way) so I checked them again and BAM my playlists showed up on my iOS device within 60 seconds. So I'm not sure if it was the turning off/on of the iTunes Match that did it, or if it was the simple checked/unchecked issue. Hope this helps someone! \n\nA: I was able to find the songs under \"albums\" on my iPhone and create a playlist. Not really a great solution but a work around. \n", "Q: Selecting all files in Finder with column view /folder1/folder2/file1\n                /file2\n        /folder3\n                /file3\n        /folder4\n                /file4\n                /file5\n                /file6\n\nGiven a folder structure such as this one.

I run Finder with XtraFinder on Mac OS X 10.8.4.\n\nA: It depends on the way the folder (or other folder-like item) is selected. If you select an item by clicking on it, command-A selects all items in the next column. If you select an item with the keyboard (or by for example revealing a folder in Finder from another application), command-A selects all items in the same column.\nYou can select all items in the current column by pressing the up or down arrow key and then command-A, or all items in the next column by pressing the right arrow key and then command-A.\n", "Q: SSH remote using XQuartz dosent work in Lion I was using previous version of Mac and used to connected to a server with SSH console.It used to run X 11 after loading my requested programs(Mathematica) on remote server and was working properly.Recently I upgraded my Mac to the latest version(Mountain Lion 10.8.4) and this SSH is not loading the \"X\" and I can not use remote access to my requested program from remote server.How can I fix the problem.Please in a easy way because I am not in using Mac commands at all.\nThanks\n\nA: As per this page, X11/XQuartz is deprecated from OS X now, and you will need to install it seperately in order to get any X-Windows display manager type stuff working:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5293\nThere seems to be another X11 download here which may also be useful.\nhttp://support.apple.com/downloads/X11_for_Mac_OS_X_1_0\n", "Q: When you terminate multi display in OS X 10.9 Mavericks, what happens?

He said first I'd need to back up the OS to a usb thumb drive and then physically replace the hard drive and then some how get the OS onto the new hard drive. \nSo far I've found a few tutorials online on how to physically replace the hard drive but it seems like a lot more work than I anticipated (ie. http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing+Mac+Mini+Late+2012+Hard+Drive+Replacement/11716/1). Although, it does seem like something I could do.\nHowever, my main difficulty now is i'm having a very hard time finding any help online on how to 'back the OS up on a usb thumb drive' and how I should re-install it once I do put in the new hard drive. He mentioned using time machine but when I open time machine it doesn't give me any options to interact with the USB thumb drive.\n\nA: *\n\n*I recently did this very thing. I backed up my OS and files to an external drive (not a thumb drive), installed the new drive with new OS, and restored the Time Machine backup to the new drive. The whole process took a couple of hours. The best online video for doing this operation IMO is here: http://eshop.macsales.com/installvideos/mac_mini2011_hd/\n\n*Replacing the hard drive will not void your AppleCare warranty. OWC addresses this issue on their blog: http://blog.macsales.com/18244-owc-diys-wont-void-your-macs-warranty\nNOTE: I have done the restore process in #1 using both Time Machine and Carbon Copy Cloner. Each is different, but relatively simple. \n\nA: You could use Apple's OS X Recovery Disk Assistant to create a bootable recovery disk on a USB thumb drive.  Since you've backed up to an external disk using Time Machine you could replace the hard drive, boot to the recovery disk on your thumb drive, use the recovery disk to format the hard drive and then reinstall 10.8/Mountain Lion.  Once Mountain Lion is installed you will walk through the same setup procedure that occurred when you first bought your Mac.  One of the first questions in the setup process is if you would like to restore information from Time Machine, which allows you to connect your Time Machine disk and restore your backup.\n\nA: Actually I did something similar recently. \nBeing an IT geek I ALWAYS want physical restore media. So using an external USB drive and following this procedure on MacOSXHints gave me the DMG disk image to burn a restore DVD for my new Mini (you'll need a dual layer disc!) or to use the Disk Utility to \"restore\" that DMG to a USB thumb drive.\nWorks like a charm:\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110831105634716\n", "Q: Terminal app no longer automatically recognizes functions in my ~/.profile any more I made some function in my ~/.profile to automate things like SSH connections.

I use a Logitech MarbleMouse, a trackball that does not have a mouse wheel. On Linux, there is a configuration option (EmulateWheel and EmulateWheelButton in evdev) that let's you press a button and have mouse/trackball motion act like a scroll wheel.  Is there anything equivalent on Mac?\n\nA: You can map scrolling to pressing a key and moving the cursor from the GUI!\nHere, I map the scrollwheel action to pressing the Fn key and moving the cursor.  Notice the nice option that enables this behavior for both horizontal and vertical scrolling.\n\nBy the way, KeyRemap4MacBook is now called Karabiner.\nhttps://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/\n\nA: You can use KeyRemap4MacBook.\nScroll by moving the pointer while holding the secondary button:\n<autogen>__PointingRelativeToScroll__ PointingButton::RIGHT</autogen>\n\nScroll by moving the  the pointer while holding F1:\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::VK_MODIFIER_EXTRA1</autogen>\n<autogen>__PointingRelativeToScroll__ PointingButton::NONE, ModifierFlag::EXTRA1</autogen>\n\nScroll with F1 and F2:\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::VK_MOUSEKEY_SCROLL_UP</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F2, KeyCode::VK_MOUSEKEY_SCROLL_DOWN</autogen>\n\nScroll by moving the pointer while holding the primary and secondary buttons:\n<autogen>__SimultaneousKeyPresses__ PointingButton::LEFT, PointingButton::RIGHT,\nKeyCode::VK_CONFIG_SYNC_KEYDOWNUP_notsave_pointing_relative_to_scroll</autogen>\n\nSee the source for the key code values and predefined settings.\n\nA: This seems to work with Karabiner-Elements again.\nYou must \"Import more rules from the Internet (open a web browser),\" get \"Change mouse motion to scroll,\" and \"Enable\" it. This adds the ability to hold a mouse button to change the mouse ball into a scroll wheel while the button is held down. You can then change the scrolling speed and feel by adjusting both \"speed\" under \"Parameters\" and adjusting \"Scrolling speed\" in the regular MacOS Mouse System Preferences Pane.\nThe speed, smoothness, and momentum of the scrolling feels a little weird; I think it's related to the difference in sensation from a regular scroll wheel which kind of clicks as it's scrolled.\n\nA: You can achieve this with the SteerMouse software, by mapping a mouse button to \"Scroll\", which will then toggle this behavior.\n\n\nA: Since Karabiner-Elements no longer seems to have this functionality, Smart Scroll is the new way. Just use Mouse Button 4 with the \"grab scroll\" option. Unfortunately scrolling will stop when the cursor hits a screen edge, so it's not true scrolling, and Photoshop doesn't support it for alt-scroll zooming.\nhttp://marcmoini.com/sx_en.html\n\nA: Now Karabiner has an option for Logitech Marble Mouse\n\n", "Q: I backed up my Android device and I want to restore it on my iphone 5!

Your photos will appear in your iPhone's Photos app.\n\n*You can do the same for videos; just click Videos instead and choose that same folder.\n\nMusic to iPhone\n\n*\n\n*Drag the iPhone folder from your desktop over your iPhone's name in the iTunes sidebar. All of your songs will be transferred to your iPhone. (You can also use this trick to transfer any other music from your desktop to your iPhone.) The music can be found in your iPhone's Music app.\n\n\n*Alternatively, if the first option didn't work for you, click File, Import Folder, and select the folder with all of your music from your Android phone. This will import all music into iTunes. After this is done (it may take awhile), go back to your iPhone by selecting it in the top right corner. Click Music, Sync All Music, then Sync Now.\nContacts to iPhone\n\n*\n\n*You need to set up an e-mail account on your iPhone for this one to work. Then, back on your computer, send yourself an e-mail with the VCF file as an attachment. Open that e-mail on your iPhone and tap the attachment. A message will pop up at the top. Tap this button \"Add all contacts.\" Your contacts will be saved to your iPhone.\n\n\nA: There are also several apps on the iOS app store to assist in migrating data. Most have a companion app on the Google Play Store to prepare the data and send it directly from one device to the other without needing a computer or cloud service.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.jamfsoftware.com/products/Relo/\nApple has an app on the Google Play Store that prepared the data and works out of the box with a new iOS phone (or one that is wiped):\n\n\n*\n\n*https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201196\nThe nice thing about these apps is they assist in re-downloading any matched free apps and Apple's app for android will add paid apps to your App Store wishlist so they are queued for you to purchase as you wish.\n", "Q: Will upgrading Mac Mini hard drive void AppleCare Warranty? After purchasing a Mac Mini, I wanted to replace the hard drive from a 5,400 rpm hard drive to a 7,200 hard drive. \nWill this replacement void my AppleCare warranty?\n\nA: Apple's warranty (AppleCare) is specific about what components are user replaceable/serviceable. The hard drive on an older MacBook for instance is user replaceable, AppleCare used to have the option to send you a replacement hard drive along with a disposable ESD wriststrap for you to install it yourself.\nThe difference though is the hard drive in the MacBook was almost as easy to access as the RAM in the Mac mini. The Mac mini's hard drive is a different story. In order to access it you have to expose the logic board which increases the chance of damage from ESD if proper precautions aren't taken. Because of this the only user replaceable part in the new minis is the RAM, since the logic board is still pretty well protected when only removing the RAM.\nThe Magnusson Moss act essentially says they can't deny warranty unless they can prove damage. It wouldn't be hard for Apple to say \"The upgrade situation you described to us implies that there was a high risk for ESD damage, which has likely caused such and such issue\".\nThe flip side though is that if an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP) installs a third party hard drive your AppleCare will remain intact because the AASP has proved to Apple that its technicians follow all safety rules and procedures when working on Macs, essentially the same reason Apple allows them to perform warranty work. Apple would then not be involved in the hard drive's warranty (though most HDDs have 3-5 year warranties of their own) but the remaining components would still be recognized as \"in warranty\" by Apple. The most you would need to do is provide a receipt for the service you had done at an AASP.\nsource: I was \"that guy\" at the Genius Bar for several years who had to turn people away from warranty coverage for unauthorized upgrades & repairs.  As soon as your Mac goes out of warranty I definitely encourage a DIY attitude, however I would try to heed the above advice while it's under AppleCare.\n\nA: The actual upgrade itself will not void your warranty.\nHowever, if at any part during the process, your Mac Mini breaks, this will not be covered by the warranty. If you can upgrade it successfully by yourself and it works perfectly, then you should not have any concern.\n\n\"The definitive answer is defined in the warranty. If you damage the\ncomputer doing any unauthorized service, then that damage is not\ncovered by the warranty. Apple service techs will assume that if they\nfind a different hard drive than the one that came with the computer,\nthen they will not repair under the warranty even if your service is\nunrelated to having replaced the drive.\"\n\nYou can avoid this problem though. In case something goes wrong, you should reinstall the old drive before taking the computer in for service, and leave no evidence you opened the computer up. (You don't have to do this if you do not feel comfortable \"cheating\").\nLinks and Resources\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2526639?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: I know this is old but if anyone else falls into this thread searching for this exact question I want to make sure they know their legal rights with upgrades. There is a little known federal law, ONLY APPLIES IN THE USA, called the \"Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act\" which says specifically that companies CANNOT require you to use only their service techs and ONLY their branded hardware when doing upgrades. This does still apply to ANY PC and has been successful in caselaw with PC's. If the warranty issue is because of the hardware you installed. Then yes it is NOT covered. But they can not just assume that just because you upgraded a part that you caused the damage. They will have to prove it. So if you hear that BS come from an Apple \"genius\" or service tech quote the federal law and if they still won't stand. Sue them in small claims and you'll get more then enough to buy yourself an new one with some money left over.\n", "Q: How do I work around a \"Could not resolve host: (nil)...\" error when installing/using Homebrew?

I have a team that all have privileges configured in Exchange to give them read/write access to the Inbox, and send-as privileges, for a shared mailbox.  This works great on Outlook, where they can log in with their credentials and just pick \"Open these additional mailboxes\" in Outlook's account settings.\nThere doesn't seem to be anything precisely parallel to this in the iPhone, and the Googling I've done suggests that the easy way won't work on the iPhone.\nBut where things get really odd is that I don't seem to be able to add another Exchange mailbox on the iPhone with the shared mailbox's username and password.  Every time I try to authenticate, I get a password error, despite validating the server settings and the password repeatedly.\nHow can I get this team the ability to receive, move/delete, and respond to emails for this shared Exchange account from their iPhones?\n\nA: As of August 2013, Exchange ActiveSync doesn't support shared Exchange accounts.  This isn't an iPhone issue, but rather with the ActiveSync protocol.\nOne option would be to use Outlook Web Access to access the shared Exchange account.  This would allow the team to do everything that you've outlined here.  \nAnother option would be to set the individual Exchange accounts for the team to automatically copy mails from the shared account into a folder on the individual's Exchange account.  However, I don't think that this will meet your needs, especially moving/deleting and responding to mails from the shared account.  I mention it for the sake of completeness.\n\nA: to access the Shared Mail Box on iPhone go to settings accounts Then Other \nenter the email address then in User Name field enter youremailhere/yoursharedemailhere use the / to identify the shared email enter your email password for main mailbox \n\nA: Alternatively, going against recommended security practices, ensure the organizational mailbox account is enabled, then allow the login credentials to be shared and connect to it as if it were a normal user's email account.\nOf course, for accountability and non-repudiation, this is not a viable option in the corporate or government offices.  Consequently, I just say Microsoft get with the program and enable support for organizational accounts with ActivSync so customers can have a true enterprise level solution.\nOther options such as using OWA are beyond rational thinking; perhaps Microsoft has never tried accessing an OWA account from smart phone to see how unrealistic it is.  And thoughts of using mail forwarding options only increases administrative burdens to unreasonable levels as well.\n", "Q: Customizing Pages' outline using paragraph styles My document in Pages 4.2 for Mac has custom paragraph styles for a couple of levels of headings.

If I can get the outline to exclude those (or restrict to the headings), that would work.\n\nA: I believe you need to use the Levels control.  In the screenshot below, my Body text (regular paragraphs) aren't shown, because I've asked the outline mode to show only heading levels 1 and 2.\n\n(I'm using Pages 4.3 but hopefully this is the same in your 4.2?)\n", "Q: Why do I need to activate my iPhone?

Perhaps activation exists to prevent Android devices from using iOS or to prevent jailbreaks and downgrades? Anyone know the real reason why?\n\nA: Activation in the sense of iPhone, or any cellular phone, for that matter, is registering and provisioning that phone for use with your cellular carrier. (Or more specifically for GSM networks, provisioning the SIM card.) It is unrelated to the type of activation found in Windows and other software.\nIt basically registers your phone with the carrier and obtains your specific settings (phone number, etc).\n", "Q: View the actual configuration of a remote printer Someone in the office set up printing from a Mac to a printer connected through USB to a Windows computer (the only Windows computer in the office).

I’m fast getting to the same place. It just seems so unstable, wishing Apple would invest some of their billions into it. I read with dismay how many people find Google Play to be so much better. As I write this I see a “Cannot connect to iTunes store” on my iPhone. Noting wrong with our connection … it’s alive and well.\nBearing in mind that I have two Macs, an iPhone and an iPad and my wife has a Mac, iPhone and iPad what we really want is the following.\nI want all our music to go up to one location (iCloud or even better our own server). I want an app or web app that I see on the right hand side a list of artists or albums (or playlists) and columns for each device. I want to be able to tick the “matrix” to specify which devices the artist/album/playlist should be downloaded to. When the device is switched on, it must download (no fuss no bother and no stupid I-can’t-do-anything-about error message). A nice enhancement would be to specify three options for each entity (Download, Stream, Not Available). There must be options to easily bulk select.\nSo … is there such a thing out there?\nIn my immediate family plus spouses and kids girlfriends/boyfriends there are 11 Macs, three iPads and 10 iPhones. My brothers are very similar. I have nieces and nephews that use Apple. My parents also use Apple. Collectively, we have a bunch of Apple equipment.\n\nA: I had some kind of similar question here.\nI decided to go my own route, because basically everything from big companies is specific to their environment. And even though it required some work, I ended up with a solution I am quite happy with.\nI have a Mac Server and a DynDNS service.\nI have a Madsonic Instance running, which is a fork of Subsonic.\nSubsonic has a lot of Apps that can be used for streaming.\nMadsonic (and any other fork) is compatible to those clients.\nSubsonic wants 1$ per month, if you want to use streaming (via Apps),\nMadsonic (and most other forks) do not.\nThe Web-UI is awesome and there are also other Web-Clients like JamStash\n,\nthat I love to use personally.\nBesides the Subsonic Setup, I have a very cleaned up iTunes Library that has Home-Sharing enabled and can sync via Wifi with my iPhone. Also including my purchases.\niTunes requires a lot of attention and maintenance as I discovered recently;\nand I would not recommend to let iTunes manage the Library itself.\nInstead I wrote some scripts (and found some)\nto make maintaining my Library a lot easier\nI decided to build up a Folder Structure, that I like\nand only let iTunes reference those files, but never touch them directly (except for metadata).\nSubsonic does not care about the management, it simply searches for new media every day/week/month (as you wish) in a folder and updates the library.\nHowever, all of that requires a lot of work.\nIf you are lazy or you simply do not care that mouch about Music, You should use another Service besides iTunes Match, as other Users also suggested (Amazon Cloud/Spotify/Ecoute/...)\nFrom where we stand today, I am very sure, that there is no solution to a good music-streaming service that we seek.\n\nA: You might consider Amazon's Cloud Player. If you pony up the subscription money, you can store upwards of 200,000 songs in Amazon's Cloud, which means they are available on ANY computer through a web browser, on desktop Macs using Amazon's  Cloud Player software, and on iDevices using their Cloud Player App.\nGetting a large amount of music onto the cloud is a pain, no question. (It took me weeks to upload my 500GB library.) But now I have access to all my music anytime, anywhere, even if I am using someone else's computer or on a PC.\nThe cloud player apps allow you to download any of your songs to any computer if you want to duplicate them locally. And, if you buy your new mp3s from Amazon, they'll just show up in your cloud player automatically.\nIt really does work, once you tough out the upload.\nEdit: Amazon Cloud Player is indeed a good alternative. Nonetheless, if you want to stream your entire iTunes Library without paying for a subscription, I recommend using the Plex app. Just set up pled on your computer and your good to go with your iTunes Library at hand! \n\nA: Stackexchange won't let me post comments, but I think it's worth mentioning that Ampache is something you should look into (on top of YoshiBotX's suggestions of a home server). It's similar to Subsonic. I have a time capsule 1TB from 2009 in bridge mode that stores all my art, music, and videos, and I pointed iTunes on my mac to it so that it looks for the iTunes library on that disk. I also set up fstab so that the timecapsule fileshare automounts into OS X (you can do this in Windows as well). The other thing I did was mounted my time capsule in Ubuntu on my web-accessible homeserver at home and have Ampache running on it and scanning the mounted filesystem. I then can stream music from web browser or to my Android phone. \nThe one thing I'll say is Ampache seems to struggle with 200 GB of music when it is indexing my library. It could also be possible that I have some weird filenames in there, too. I haven't messed with it much recently so they could have made it more stable. \nI use TuneUp (an iTunes addon) for renaming my song files and cleaning up names/albums/artists. TuneUp is able to determine what to name and title a song based on just the sound signature of the file. I use GetLyrical for automatically fetching and applying lyrics to the .m4a and .mp3 files. \nThe only thing I've mentioned so far that costs money is TuneUp (and the time capsule and home server, but I got those for free). All the hosting I've set up is free as well. \nI have also read that there are ways to share your iTunes library through the internet but I think my solution is more robust. \nUPDATE- forgot to mention.. you will probably see a 3 second delay on accessing music if it's stored on a time capsule (or maybe a NAS that allows disks to sleep). The time capsule allows disks to spin down when they're not in use or when the music is cached to your PC so it has to spin up on first open. The advantage to this though is that I don't have to buy a 3 tb 2.5 hdd drive to fit in my laptop, so the tradeoff is worth it IMO. YMMV.\n\nA: I would say your best choice is the Ecoute for Mac!\nAnd for your iPhone ect (IOS) there is a version for that.\nA stand alone music player that will interact with existing iTunes libraries.\nYou can read some ratings here.\n", "Q: How Can I install Java on mac I want to install java plug-in in firefox . \nI read that installing java plug-in is not secure.\nEDIT1 : Can anyone please tell me why java installation is not secure, and should I install it or not.\n\nA: Download and install Java from java.com.\n\nIf it doesn't seem to work, check if it is installed using Java Tester. If it only doesn't work in Firefox, make sure that the Java plugin is enabled in the Add-ons Manager tab:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the menu bar, click on the Tools menu, and then click Add-ons. The Add-ons Manager tab will open.\n\n*In the Add-ons Manager tab, select the Plugins panel.\n\n*Click on the Java Applet Plug-in to select it.\n\n*Select Always Activate in its drop-down menu if it's not already set.\n\n\nA: No nontrivial software is absolutely secure, at least when it is exposed to the Internet. Rather, software security is a relative term: Some software is more secure, other software less so.\nAs for java, when run as a plugin in the browser, I think it is safe to say that its security record has been rather abysmal. There have been many security holes, and though all publicly known security holes have been patched as far as I know, history does not inspire confidence.\nSince you use firefox, you can improve your security somewhat by enabling plugins.click_to_play. If you do, all plugins such as flash and java will be disabled on every web page you visit until you click on the plugin to allow it to run.\nTo enable this feature, type about:config in the Firefox address bar and hit return. You may get a warning. Take it seriously! Messing around in about:config without knowing what you're doing can really ruin your setup. Anyhow, find the option plugins.click_to_play in the list – there is a handy search box that you can use – and double click the line to toogle the value between false and true.\nSee also this question, which I noticed after writing the above.\n", "Q: Ios app transfer I am developing an ios app for a client and would like to know that when I go for the $99 developer program I can post the app and get all the help but what about when I want to provide everything to the client will they have to get another apple id and sign up again for the $99 program or will they have to go for some other program and can the app be transferred from my account to theirs, it is going to be a free app, so if I manage it in the clients name is that okay. the app developed by should come as the \"company's name\"\n\nA: Yes, you can transfer apps between developers' apple id. \nSee apple's official documentation:\n\nYou can now transfer qualifying apps to another account — useful in\n  cases of an acquisition or asset purchase.

I restarted it normally through the system, but it had not started up when I checked few minutes later. When I try to turn it on it seems normal first, but after couple of seconds a process bar appears, loads around one fifth through, after which the computer shuts down again. \nMy laptop runs Lion, and this isn't the first time it's acting up. My hard drive crashed few months back, but IT at my school was able to fix it (has not made the \"dying hard drive\" clicks much since then) \nWhere could the problem be, any way to fix it myself or should I bring it to Apple care?\n\nA: If your hard drive was clicking audibly, I'd say the actual hard drive has failed. Even if it did stop doing it as often, that's basically the Death Rattle as far as hard drives go.\nThe below is a copy-paste of an answer for how to get a Macbook booting again through a really base-level disk repair, but it doesn't always work. Give it a shot, but I really recommend you call up AppleCare or go to your nearest Apple Store or Apple Authorised Repairer to organise service and have the hard drive and hard drive cable replaced.\nI've modified the following a little bit from the source, since it was referring to a few things not relevant here.\nUltimately, I just hope you already have a backup.\n\nTry a filesystem check from Single-User Mode\nStart up the Mac while holding option, and then select your Macintosh HD, and before pressing the return key, press and hold the Command key and the S key. while holding them, press return, and once the screen goes black and text appears, let of of the Command and S keys.\nWhen it finishes loading, you'll get a section of text as follows:\nSingleuser boot -- fsck not done\nRoot device is read-only\nIf you want to make modifications to files:\n    /sbin/fsck -fy\n    /sbin/mount -uw /\nif you wish to boot the system:\n    exit\n:/ root#\n\nSome other messages may pop up after that, but once you see that on your screen, type that first sbin command:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n\nThat'll go though, check your filesystem for errors, and try to repair them, and if it does, then it will recheck, and rerepair if needed, up to three times.\nKeep running that till it doesn't bring up \"repairing\" messages, or you get the EXACT same repairing messages twice in a row.\nAt that point, type reboot and see if it starts up. This is similar to using Recovery HD's disk utility to repair disk, but definitely has a higher success rate.\nIf at any point you get a:\nRead: I/O error\n\nthen it means either the Hard Drive, Hard drive Cable or SATA controller is failing.\nIf you get up to your user account screen, when you type in your password, hold the shift key and then press the return key, and let go of the shift key when you see your desktop, so that you start up with the minimum startup applications and processes.\nIf you get it booting, I recommend copying all your files off to another disk, reformatting your Macintosh HD volume and Reinstalling OS X, since the FSCK single user method mostly just gets your drive to a workable state but doesn't usually prevent it from degrading in the future.\n\nAgain, if the drive has previously been making clicking sounds, get it serviced, preferably before your Warranty runs out.\nIf you can get a reservation at a nearby Apple Store, they may be able to get you started up from their network and you might be able to copy files from your computer to an external hard drive, so if you need to be able to do that, take an external hard drive in with you.\nIf you're going to a Authorised Repairer, but it isn't an Apple Store, they'll probably charge to do they same thing, but still worth it if you don't have a backup.\n\nA: Bad logic board or bad keyboard.   To test the keyboard theory, try booting up but keeping a key held down (like space or shift).  Does it boot fully, but shut off if the key is released?  Replace keyboard.  If that doesn't work, replace logic board.  They seem quite sensitive to heat.  \n", "Q: How can I know if I have any Notifications with newer OS X Notifications bar? I have OS X 10.8, and one thing I don't understand about the new Notifications system is that the icon in the menu bar doesn't tell me whether I have any notifications or not. The icon (  ) looks the same to me whether I have notifications or not.  Every once in a while I'll click on it, and realize that I have Notifications from weeks earlier.  \nAm I missing how this is supposed to be used?  Is there a way to have this icon change color when there are notifications?  Can I simply disable this panel and icon?\n\nA: The icon does not change color (other than when you temporarily disable Notification Center, but that only lasts until the following day). The other things that happen, such as banners, icon badges, etc are the actual \"notification\".\nTo temporarily disable Notification Center (until the following day), Option+click on the Notification Center icon. The icon will turn grey to show it is disabled temporarily. Clicking on it reveals a message that notifications will resume tomorrow. Dragging the Off slider to the right will re-enable it immediately.\n\nTo permanently disable Notification Center, follow these steps from OSXDaily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal.\n\n*Enter the following command:\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist\n\n\n*Enter the following command:\nkillall NotificationCenter\n\nThis disables it for the current user only.\n", "Q: Get computer name from IP-address I have the IP address of a computer on my network but is there a way that with the IP address I can find the name of computer?\nFor example, if I know the IP address is 192.154.23.60, can I use this IP from my Mac to see the name, such as Jacob's MacBook?\n\nA: Without further access to the host (e.g. ssh or ARD) and no service running on it (e.g. iTunes Music Sharing/File Sharing) you can't get the computer name based on the IP-address.\nThe computer name in macOS is not necessarily indentical to the hostname or the Bonjour name! You can simply check this with scutil --get { ComputerName | LocalHostName | HostName }. ComputerName is the user friendly name, LocalHostname is the Bonjour name - both also visible in System Preferences > Sharing - and HostName is the hostname of the device. The hostname is usually related to or used with DNS, NIS, hosts file or similar methods of name resolution. On a newly installed consumer system no hostname is set. ComputerName and LocalHostName are usually derived from the first user's name and the Mac model (e.g. Admin's iMac | Admins-iMac).\nWithout a name record for the remote Mac in your hosts file or on a DNS-server in your local or a public network neither of the tools mentioned in the other answers (arp, ping, host) can be used to resolve the hostname.\nIf a known Bonjour service is running on the remote Mac you can get the Computer and the Bonjour name of an IP in a two-step process by retrieving all hosts offering it with dns-sd -Z _nfs._tcp local (the example service here is NFS - other service names can be found here) and pinging all listed Bonjour names until you find the proper IP. As an GUI alternative you can use the Bonjour Browser.\nIn some cases you can get a name similar to the Bonjour name by entering smbutil status <IP>. The name is the NetBIOS name which is the \"all-caps and without allmost all special characters\" version of the Computer/Bonjour name.\n\nA: In Terminal I would use arp\n\n\n*\n\n*First make sure you have sent at least one packet to this machine using ping.  \n$ ping -c 1 2.2.2.12\n  PING 2.2.2.12 (2.2.2.12): 56 data bytes  \n  64 bytes from 2.2.2.12: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.981 ms  \n\n\n*Next arp that address.  \n$ arp 2.2.2.12\n  <host>.<domain> (2.2.2.12) at 0:1c:c4:f4:b8:c7 on en1 ifscope [ethernet]\n\n\nA: From the Terminal.app (or equivalent) you can use the host command to show the network name of the computer. This returns the name even if it has all sharing settings turned off and thus not showing via Finder.\nFor example, in my network I get the following (where I know the IP-address and the first part of the returned name is the computer's name)\n➜ ~ host 192.168.2.135\n\n135.2.168.192.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer raspberrypi.private.lan.\n\nIt depends on the actual name of the computer if the network name is exactly the same, as in your example, I guess it would become Jacobs-MacBook.\n\nA: Just Ping that ip address with -a option. It will show you the computer name.\nExample ping -a 192.168.0.1\n\nA: In Finder, go to your computer (which should be listed on the left sidebar under Devices). Then double-click on Network.

Since some time my MacBook is constantly hotter than it used to be, even when not having much CPU load. What could the cause be?\nResetting the System Management Controller (SMC) didn't completely work, I think it has decreased since I reset it but not completely.\n\nA: Sometimes is is good to reset the SMC.\nSMC controls the devices on your computer including the fans.\nIntel-based Macs: Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC)\n\nA: Don't overlook purely software usage.   If you browse sites with flash content it is not unusual for it put more load on the machine.   you mention \"not having much CPU load\" which implies that the machine is not totally idle.  Is it while doing absolutely nothing with machine?   Switch to another browser for a while and see if it makes difference.\n\nA: To kill a problem, you have to see it and then understand it.\nFor this hunt, I advise to start with the Activity Monitor which is here:\nApplications/Utilities/Activity Monitor\n\nLook at what is using the CPU when your MacBook is heating and when it is at a normal temperature. Try starting and stoping your actual programs one at a time and let the system take the time to free all the threads involved and the temperature decrease.\nThe delay between a hog kill and the fan slow down may be bigger than a minute.\n\nA: Try disabling helpers on your browser (like Avast) which might be working too hard.

The %N in the format is the filename of symbolic link and the %SY is the way to print out the name of the file it points to with the string \" -> \" before it. (The S usually means to print the field as a string but it has the special meaning for \"Y\", the name of the file pointed to, which adds the arrow before the file name.)\n", "Q: use different terminal setting after ssh into another machine I would like to use different terminal setting after doing a ssh into another machine.  This would mean I could have my terminals to different machine using different colours.  Is this possible?  Thanks.\n\nA: Yes! It absolutely is possible.\nThe colors and other aspects of your prompt are controlled by configuration files.\nIf you're using the default bash, shell then one place where you can configure your prompt is in a file in your home directory called .bash_profile.\nSince the .bash_profile file has a \".\" at the beginning of its name, it may not be visible in Mac Finder windows, but you can see it listed in your terminal among others in your home directory by entering ls -al.\nYou'll have a .bash_profile file on your own Mac, and you'll also have another one on each remote computer you log into.

I recently had an issue with it where I can't save to it anymore because it was corrupted. The way to fix it is to reformat the drive completely so I'm trying to copy everything on the drive over to my cloud (BitCasa or Dropbox), reformat the drive and then move everything back.\nI have my Music folder on the hard drive and I've been able to move that successfully. When I try to move the Time Machine backups it says:\nThe volume is the wrong format for a backup.\n\nI know that hard drives have to be 'formatted' to the Mac in order to be used for Time Machine backups but is there a way to just move the backup files around so I can get them off the hard drive. Thanks for your help!\n\nA: If your drive is corrupted in any way you probably don't want to use it for backup purposes any more, unless the data is not of great value to you.\nApple does not allow an easy transfer from drive to drive regarding backups. I think this is due to the way TimeMachine works (As stated in this apple discussion thread)\nNow how to do it anyways ? I would simply use command line power. If you're the admin of the computer, you can simply open Terminal and do something along this:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo -s\n\n*rsync -avhW --progress < Drag and drop external Hard Drive here >< Drag and Drop DropBox folder here >\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*mv < Drag and Drop backup folder here >< Drag and Drop DropBox folder here, ending with a \"/\">\n\n\nsudo -s puts you in the super-admin position, so you have full access to the system \nrsync will sync the content and you can stop and continue at any time.\nmv will move the whole thing at once.\nYou should be able to drag and drop any folder within the backup to any folder on you internal/other external drive. Only the \"Machine.backup\" folder is protected.\n\nA: I've never tried this, so it's a theory only -\nCopy the backup to a sparse bundle disk image\n\n*\n\n*Launch Disk Utility.\n\n*From the Toolbar, select 'New Image'\n\n*In the Create dialog, set\n\n*\n\n*size to be sufficient to contain the entire backup you wish to create [it will start smaller & grow to that maximum size as you fill it.]\n\n*Format - Mac Extended (Journaled)\n\n*Partitions - no partition map\n\n*Image Format - sparse bundle disk image\n\n\n\n*Disk Utility will save the image file where you asked it, format & mount to the desktop.\n\nIf we're lucky, that will then allow you to copy...\nJan 21, 2023 update: I confirmed the theory. I successfully used this technique to create a sparse bundle image on an APFS formatted external SSD. Finally, MacOS Ventura 13.1 allowed me to copy an old Backups.backupdb folder using Finder from an older and failing Mac OS Extended (Journaled) formatted external HDD.\n\nA: Copying the entire drive is a really bad idea for several reasons. Copying it to the cloud is also a bad idea. Buying a new TB or larger drive is far cheaper, faster, and easier and would let you just start backing up and put the \"corrupt\" backup on the shelf until you're sure you don't need to recover any files from it.\nSince Time Machine can back up to more than one destination, I would add a second drive to have a temporary or permanent second copy of backup data.\n\nDue to the hard links that are used to save space when a file isn't changed, your backup method will have to deal with these links to avoid increasing the data transfer and storage requirements (depending on how many backup intervals are stored - you could end up with Petabytes of data from a 500 GB store of data).\nIt's much, much better to just pick one or two intervals to back up or let a tool like BackupLoupe interpret for you which files changed at which point in the backup so you can intelligently copy the files you really need off the drive.\nAgain, if you have more than 1 GB of files, I would avoid DropBox and slower clouds and get a tool crafted for large transfers like Arq or Transmit and push your files to Amazon S3 or possibly Glacier if you have multiple terabytes or more to store but won't likely restore any or all of it once you've determined what's really of value in the backup drive.\nIn practice, anything that lets you store unlimited data in the cloud will take far too long to get there, so minimize what you send up or pay for reasonable speed for the time you'll need it in the cloud.\nThat being said, if you really need to store it all, use Disk Utility to create an image of the drive (which hopefully can be done - it might fail to comply depending on the corruption that is present) so that you only copy the actual space used and don't get the hard links expanded into multiple copies of each file. Once you have a dmg (or compressed dmg), you can upload that.\n\nA: There are three ways to handle corrupted Time Machine backup drives:\n\n\n*\n\n*(easiest) Forget about the backup. It's a backup - you are not losing anything. Just erase it and start again.\n\n*Copy the final backup (or just the parts that are really important) to other media. This can be done in the Finder, and it requires about the same space as what is currently on your drive/folders now. Note that restoring is not necessary - you already have the latest \"backup\" on your computer's primary drive\n\n*Copy the entire volume, as-is. unmount the Time Machine drive and use either Disk Utility or Carbon Copy Cloner to do a block-level copy to it's new home. You will require another local volume at least as large as the current Time Machine volume. If you want to store it somewhere else, you can use a disk image - it counts as a \"volume\".\nUnfortunately, there is no step between 2 and 3. Time Machine backups are one or all - it's not possible to split it in half.\nIf you are still considering cloud storage, I would think again. Look at the cost (and time) involved vs. the $100 cost of a 1 terabyte external drive.\n\nA: Use Carbon Copy Cloner.  You can get a 30 day trial.  HOWEVER, when you are selecting your backup, don't just open the root directory of the drive.  Go into the drive, click on \"Backups.backupdb\" and you should see the name of your backup (ie, \"Johns iMac\"), click that, then click on \"latest\", there you will see the name of your hard drive (\"Macintosh HD\" by default unless it was manually changed).  Drag/Drop that folder into Carbon Copy Cloner and select where you want to copy it to.  Downside is, you cannot use Apple Time Machine to restore that folder.  However, you will have a backup of your Time Machine drive.  If it's just applications, pictures, documents, videos, you can just put them on your computer where you want them, then do a new backup drive.  I tried that top answer and it was taking FOREVER.  Took about 15 minutes to do 537.5MB of data and Carbon Copy Cloner has done almost 7GB in 12 minutes....\n", "Q: Is there a way to delete something off your computer but not your itunes account? Memory on my computer is running low. Is there a way to remove stuff from my iTunes account (like delete them from my computer) and still have them on my account (not delete them off my account) so that I can access them on another computer? \n\nA: There are several ways. \nEasiest, but most costly is to subscribe to iTunes Match service which will let you download your entire library on another device and keep it in the cloud for you.  \nHarder, but relatively cheaper is to migrate your iTunes library to another computer. \nMigrating iTunes library when replacing the hard disk\nMiddle-ground is to enable home sharing which is a simple way to transfer. \ntransferring itunes\nThen afterwards delete songs from old comp. easiest thing to do for that is delete it from iTunes and agree to also remove the file and remove from library (on this computer). Old files will be in the trash bin until you empty it. \n", "Q: Why do all of the .dmg files I download end up on my desktop? When I download a .dmg file it somehow ends up on my desktop automatically. Even after I install the .dmg, it is still on my desktop.\nHow do I stop these from appearing on my desktop? Should they be there?\n\nA: If you mean volumes that are shown after you mount dmg files, you can uncheck this checkbox:\n\nYou can eject volumes from Finder's sidebar or by selecting their icons and pressing ⌘E.\n\nA: Depends on which browser you're using but you likely have safari settings configured to save all downloads to desktop. You can change this behavior in the preferences menu and have it save everything to downloads or simply ask you where you want to save. \nAs for the .dmg files, after installing, you want to \"eject\" the dmg file by going into finder, left sidebar, scroll down, and clicking the eject icon next to the dmg file you see mounted there.  Then you can simply trash the dmg file or move it to another folder if you want to keep it. \n\nA: I was having issues with Sequel Pro.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the dmg file.\n\n*You will see a folder open.\n\n*This folder shows the icon for the app.\n\n*Drag that to the applications folder.\n\n\nYou can open your app from the Applications folder now.\nYou can delete your dmg file or keep it, up to you.\n", "Q: How to completely disable Airplay in Mac OS X I'd like to cut out AirPlay entirely.\nLooking for an answer, I read\nDisable AirPlay on a Mac\nBut it didn't really offer a direct solution.  \nHere is my problem:\nI have the household media room connected to an Airplay capable receiver.  Our media server is a secondary Mac that runs 24/7 for the express purpose of serving media throughout the house.  This is a headless machine that does not ever output any audio of its own, and in fact could have all audio drivers disabled and it would be perfectly fine with me.\nWhat happens is, this machine appears to spontaneously decide that it wants to connect to the Airplay receiver, which causes my Media room to suddenly switch input sources and is seriously irritating and confusing to other members of the household.\nIf I could simply disable Airplay completely on this machine, then all would be well.  But I don't want to impact any other internet connectivity as I have multiple apps that need to communicate at all times in both directions to the outside internet.\nIs there in fact a direct way to simply disable Airplay entirely in Mac OS X?\n\nA: I have just found some help here: Disable AirPlay Mirroring. It will let you disable Airplay Mirroring (I assume that includes just the sound) by using a terminal command. It will deny the computer access to the AirPlay.app that allows Airplay mirroring.\nsudo chmod 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/AirPlayUIAgent\nSome problems are associated with this though. I've copied the article's \"drawbacks\" below.\n\nThe only drawback to this method is that it locks up the menubar, which means your users won't be able to use any of the menu bar items. They're still able to adjust the volume using the keyboard, though. Logging out and back in will restore the functionality of the menubar until the user tries to use AirPlay mirroring again. I guess if your users complain about the menubar crashing, you know what they've been trying to do! To remove your users temptation of crashing the menu bar all the time, you can hide the AirPlay icon by opening System Preferences > Displays and unchecking the \"Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available\" checkbox. \n\nif you don't enjoy it afterwards and you want to fix it back to defaults without reinstalling OS X you want to do the same steps above like you did when disabling AirPlay. But instead of the 000 after sumo chmod you want to use the numbers 755\nYou would follow the steps, restart your iMac like before and you should have re-enabled it back\n\nA: Have you tried installing Soundflower, the audio routing driver from the Max SP people? It's free.\nSet Output to Soundflower in System Preferences. In your case you will also want to set Sound Effects to the same thing.\nThat will basically capture all the audio on the system and consign it to the bit bucket.\n\nA: I saw Hotdog Man's answer and from the Settings I muted the Sound Output for the Apple TV device, and switched to a different sound output.\nI was then able to turn Airplay off from the Display settings, and no longer received those annoying prompts.\nBefore I switched the Sound Output setting, I was unable to turn it off from the Display settings.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> Sound -> Output. There it will say choose a device for sound output,with a table listing the Mac's speakers or Apple TV, and if you have headphones then also those.\n\nA: Maybe I'm not understanding the question, but all of my Macs have a menu item that says \"Turn Off AirPlay Mirroring\". It is accessible directly from the AirPlay menu icon, as well as from the Displays preference pane under Settings.\n", "Q: Stuck at Apple logo during boot. Cannot enter Safe mode. Cannot use Recovery USB A little background\nI wanted to create a Mountain Lion recovery USB because I currently only have a Lion recovery USB. While downloading the installer image from the Mac App store, the computer froze and I had to perform a hard shutdown.\nMy question\nI cannot boot into OSX anymore. How can I get it working again? I will try anything.\nWhat I have tried\n\n*\n\n*Entering Safe mode by holding shift on startup. But this does not seem to work. No matter how I do it.\n\n*Using the Lion recovery USB. This does not work either - I can only see a grey circle with a slash. Maybe this is happening because I have Mountain Lion installed. As I have said above, I do not have a Mountain lion recovery USB.\n\n*Contacting Apple Care / Genius bar because this Macbook Air has Apple Care. They will not help, because the Macbook Air's warranty is no longer valid as my Mac suffered from water damage not too long ago.\n\n*Downloading Mountain Lion from another Mac which only runs Lion. This is not possible in this case: The Mac App Store will only \"offer\" to download Mountain Lion - but when I click it the download is blocked because the Mac only runs Lion and cannot update to Mountain Lion (the Mac is too old). I should be able to download Lion at least, but have not found any option.\n\n\nA: PRAM Reset\nOn boot, hold ⌘ cmd + ⌥ alt + P + R until the second boot chime. This can fix a variety of things including problems due to recent kernel panics.\nRecovery HD\nOn boot, hold ⌘ cmd + R to boot into the Recovery HD. If this fails, hold ⌥ alt on boot, and select Recovery from the options available.\nFrom here, you can open Disk Utility and select Repair Disk.\nTarget Disk Mode\nIf you wish to get information from the computer, and you have another computer and some way of connecting the two, you can boot into Target Disk Mode by holding T on boot. Files can then be taken off the drive by the other computer as if it was a normal external drive.\nInternet Recovery\nIf you have a recent backup or Target Disk Mode worked (and your Mac is post-July 2011) you can start fresh by using Internet Recovery.\nHold ⌘ cmd + ⌥ alt + R on boot to begin. A new copy of OS X will be downloaded from the internet and installed, erasing your internal drive.\n\n\nA: This is a reply to @grgarside's post. Because the answer is so long, I'm posting it as another answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*A PRAM reset did not change anything except for the bringing back the loud choo choo sound. :/\n\n*I don't have a recovery partition anymore - it must have disappeared when I was changing the partition table using Disk Utility.\n\n*This requires a FW 400 to TB cable which I do not have. \n\n*This caused lots of unexpected, unintuitive troubles...\n\n\n*Even though I have a German keyboard layout, the keyboard layout was for some reason changed to US English. Try figuring that out if you don't see the characters you type because they appear as dots only.   \n\n*My wifi is WPA2 only and Internet recovery can't communicate with that standard. Therefore I had to change the wireless protocol to WPA/WPA2. \n\n*Even though I have purchased Mountain Lion with the my Apple ID, the internet recovery only offered to download Lion. When choosing Lion, I got this error: \"The install data could not be written to the Volume. Contact AppleCare.\"\n\n\n*So, I had to recover from my Time Machine backup. \"That's the better option anyway,\" you may think. No, it's not - because I won't get the recovery partition. If you want a recovery partition, you need to first install a fresh copy of OS X and then use the migration assistant to recover your data from the Time Machine backup.\n\n\n\nSo, I went ahead and started to recover my Time Machine Backup after partitioning the disk. Somewhere in the middle the backup aborted with the message: \"During recovery an error occurred. Restart the computer and retry the recovery.\"\n\nAfter entering Internet Recovery for a second time, the internal SSD is not shown anymore (in Disk Utility or using 'diskutil list'). Even an Ubuntu live USB will not see it, as if the EFI decided to hide it...\n\nUpdate:\nAfter another attempt to enter internet recovery, the SSD appeared again and I managed to fully recovery my 10.8.4 Time Machine Backup! \n", "Q: What are these weird permissions? ==> d????????? ? ? ??

I'm using OSX, and I have an email in the inbox, and a Finder folder nearby. \n\nIf I drag the email into the window I get a nice file in the folder with the subject I'd expect and so on. \ndragging....\n\nand now in the file. \nMy problem is this, if I select more than one mail message in mail, I'd like all the mail messages to be put in the folder - but unfortunatley, I get a red mark and the action is proibited.  What am I doing wrong? \n\n\nA: As some users have commented, there just isn't an implementation in the Apple Mail application to do this, for some reason. An alternative is to make a new mailbox in Mail (Menu -> Mailbox -> New), copying/moving the emails over there and right clicking on the mailbox, choosing Export. This will make a mbox-file with the emails that can be opened with most email applications.\nYou can also mark all the emails you want to save, choose Save As from the File menu, and save them. This will save them as a single rtf-file.\nIt's strange that Apple hasn't implemented this, they definitely should. I looked into an Automator-solution as well, but the mail-actions are very limited, unfortunately.\n", "Q: Open contact group on Mac I just want to use AppleScript to open an existing group in Mac Address Book (v7.1).\ntell application \"Contacts\"\n    set selected of group \"friend\" to true\n    activate\nend tell\n\nabove is the sample code for what I want.\n\nA: This probably isn't the best Applescript code ever written but it did work for me to list the people in a specific group (on 10.8 mountain lion).\ntell application \"Contacts\"\n    activate\n    set grp to first group where (name = \"friend\")\n    tell grp\n        get people\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: Above script works only if the group with name 'friend' actually exists.

I thought it might do this because my iPhone is cracked and I've thought about getting the screen fixed but I'm not sure if that's the reason why it's hot. I have also stopped using, I haven't used it for a few weeks now but it still heats up when I charge it. What can I do to resolve this problem? \n\nA: 1. Bad Connection\nIn areas with poor or reduced connectivity, iPhone has to expend more time searching for and maintaining network connections. This in turn uses more energy which causes the battery to heat up.\nPossible Solution\nYou can try turning Airplane Mode on and see if you have the same problem with heating up.  I also have an iPhone and I myself notice that it does not heat up if I am out in the open, but it heats up and drains the battery if I am in the basement of a large concrete building.\n2. Case?\nIf you have a case for your iPhone, you should expect that it heats up. The case, while it does protect your phone, also blocks some air from coming out and consequently causes the hot air to be trapped inside the phone. This will cause your iPhone to heat up almost indefinitely.\nPossible Solution\nWhen you are charging your iPhone, take it out of its case. While this may be inconvenient, it will help.\n3. CPU Usage\nIf your phone is heating up, you may have a lot of applications open. Also, if you were playing a lot of games, then you can expect an increase in CPU usage and temperature as well.\nAll of the listed items below can contribute to an increase in CPU Usage:\n\n*\n\n*Games\n\n*Data Usage (Facebook, Emails)\n\n*Fetch/Push Data\n\nPossible Solutions\n\n*\n\n*Do a Network Connections Reset (Go to Settings => General => Reset => Reset Network Settings, then reboot (you will lose WiFi passwords)\n\n\n*Try disabling the following apps (in Settings => General => Restrictions): Multiplayer Games, Ping, App Store, iTunes Store. Then reboot.\n4. Defect\nIf nothing else works, then it is also quite possible that your iPhone is defective and if this continues to occur as you have stated, I would take it to an Apple Store. They may be able to better diagnose the problem.\nLinks and Resources\nMacRumours\nApple Discussion Board\nApple Discussion Board\n\nA: My iphone gets hot too, take out the case, it may help.\nWhen I take out my case, my iphone isn't that hot. Some cases trap the heat while it is charging, therefore the iphone will get hot.\n\nA: This IS normal and happens to my iPhone all the time. However you might want to take it to the apple store to check if there is a problem. If there IS a problem on software then Apple will replace your iPhine.\n\nA: Cases and Charging\nCharging your iPhone while in certain carrying cases may generate excess heat, which can affect battery capacity. If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when you charge it, take it out of its case first.\n\nA: My iphone 4 started getting hot and would not hold a charge after I made an update.  I suffered with this for about 2 months until I got in contact with the iphone company and finally talked to the right person to fix both the getting hot and the battery charge problem.  Here is what you do: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings  \n\n*Go to General  \n\n*Click on Reset Network Settings \n\n*Exit the app\n\n*Turn off the iPhone\n\n*Wait for 5 seconds \n\n*Turn your iphone back on. YOUR PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED! \n\n\nA: try taking it apart and cleaning any dust or dirt off the logic board then put it back together. I did that to mine it worked fine \n\nA: Too much stuff in one time that's why I had to reset all my things and it works and it's all saved and even though my iphone is cracked when it's charging so it will work I promise\n\nA: charge through ur PC/laptop, wont heat up that much\n\nA: I have an iPhone 4S and it has a crack on the back on the right hand side, away from the camera. \nMy phone heats up as well when charging the solution is:\nWhen you are charging the phone put the screen face down on a table and let it charge that way it won't heat up.\n\nA: DO NOT USE Rechargable cases.\nif you use your display colors will be suck as my iphone.\ndo not charge using recharable cases if iphone battery is low (%20-%10).\nafter 20-30 charge your iphone display color tone will be pink on the middle of the screen area. and I know you wont want this.\nbest method is\nIm warning you -do not use rechargable cases-\nfirst of all chage using cable %70-%80, than you can continue charging using rechargable case without any heat.if you dont do that you will see a pink display area on your screen.after a while.

But I feel this is wrong place to have a command line application located. Where in the Mac OS X filesystem should I store command line applications?\n/Applications/ also feels wrong, it´s more for desktop applications. And /bin/ sounds more for applications that belongs to OS X.\n\nA: Consider creating an /opt directory, which is another location that custom Unix software would appear by convention.\n\nA: Since OS X comes from a unix heritage, you will want to store system files in /usr/local/bin for command line applications and scripts that belong to the system locally and not to a specific user. You may need to create this directory first by running:\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin\n\nYou can move any command line application to that folder by running:\nsudo mv my-binary /usr/local/bin/\n\nTo make sure that /usr/local/bin is part of your standard search path in Terminal, check the content of /etc/paths and add it if necessary:\ngrep -w /usr/local/bin /etc/paths || sudo sh -c 'echo /usr/local/bin >> /etc/paths'\n\n\nSome users make a second directory for user level scripts, but this is even more subject to personal preference.\nI typically make a bin directory in each user folder and then hide it from Finder - but you can make that decision yourself whether you want it hidden:\n mkdir ~/bin\n chflags hidden ~/bin\n\nIn this case, you'll want to have each user's path include this location by modifying the shell startup scripts (~/.bash_profile for bash which is the standard shell)\n export PATH=$PATH:~/bin\n\nor by hard coding the path to each app when you run it.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro repeatedly freezes, often with odd display glitches I have an older, 2007 15-inch MacBook Pro (model identifier MacBookPro3,1)  which has begun freezing repeatedly. \nIf I boot into Single User Mode it stays operative, however I've begun to get graphic glitches here too:\n \nBooting to the Mountain Lion recovery partition, a disc, or any other graphic interface I get a freezing hang. This is often before the machine has booted completely.\nAt other times it will repeatedly reboot.\nI have reset SMC and PRAM, and run fsck -fy on the drive. \nI should also note that the machine generally kicks up its fan pretty quickly and runs very hot, even in Single User Mode, so I am suspecting overheating, perhaps brought on by the video demands?\nDoes anyone else have a guess at this and/or another diagnostic step?\n\nA: The symptoms you describe could all be explained by a failing GPU system but before seeking a hardware repair (or quote), I would try reinstalling a clean version of OS X - perhaps the original version that shipped with that Mac to ensure that the hotness and slowness isn't because of added load the new OS has provided and actually something relating to hardware cooling or heat generation.\nYour picture is very telling as well.\nThe three things that hardware could fail are:\n\n\n*\n\n*LCD panel and cabling\n\n*GPU itself\n\n*VRAM\n\n\nThe patterns you show in single user mode could either be software or hardware. If it's hardware, they will get worse over time (perhaps dramatically worse) and we've already covered the software angle. Usually when the hardware is faulty, you can get poor graphics in single user mode or the boot selection screen - so you might be right it's overheating / the hardware starting to fail.\n", "Q: Flash Player 11.8 install fails with error code 30 listed in console I am installing the most recent Flash Player 11 for Firefox/Safari, and after running the .pkg from Finder the installation always fails at 50%. I find this error in the console at the end of installation:\n8/11/13 12:46:07.911 PM [0x0-0xf30f3].com.solidstatenetworks.awkhost: 2013-08-11\n12:46:07.910 Adobe Flash Player Install Manager[1628:707] \nInstall failed with error code: 30.\n\nThis has happened for the past few minor releases, not just current (11.8.800.94). How can I complete the installation? I am running Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.\n\nA: I completed the installation by running the installer as root from the shell, under its mountpoint at /Volumes. The full path to the installer executable's directory is /Volumes/Adobe Flash Player Installer/Install Adobe Flash Player.app/Contents/MacOS\nThis thread in Adobe forums describes the underlying problem - the current user can't write to a directory the installer needs. Instead of chmod'ing the folder, I already had root enabled, and went from there successfully.\nUpdate: Commentor is right, root is too risky. Follow the chmod route.\n\nA: The thread in the Adobe forums didn't help me. For me Console made no mention of a permissions problem in /var/folders like that thread says. I had to use sudo on the command line to get it installed. Pity but what else can one do.\n\nA: In addition to running the installation program from the Terminal command line as 'root', I also had to go into Safari Preferences / Security / Plug-In Settings and change the Adobe Flash Player's \"When visiting other web sites\" from \"No\" to \"Ask\".\n\nA: Use the sudo command then copy and paste where the executable file is at.

When I go direct and search on iTunes for the music I have downloaded it says I have purchased but wont let me re download.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You can download previous purchases from the App Store, iBooks Store and iTunes store. The following Apple article outlines what you need to do depending on the store and platform you are using. \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT2519\n\nA: Follow the steps..\nOn an iPhone or iPod touch\n1.Open the iTunes Store app.\n2.At the bottom of the screen, tap More > Purchased > Music.\n3.Tap \"Not on This iPhone\" or \"Not on This iPod.\"\n4.Find the song that you want to download, then tap it.\n5.Tap the Download icon to the right of the title. Your song downloads to your device.\n\n\nA: Generally you can't re-download purchased songs from the iTunes Store, but this link suggests that there might be a way to do it after all. \n\n[...]But first, make absolutely sure that you don’t have any copies,\n  anywhere. It’s only prudent.\nOnce you are really sure that those iTunes songs are gone, here’s what\n  to do:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the iTunes Store on your device.\n  \n*Make sure you are signed in with the same account used for the original purchase.\n  \n*Tap Purchased from the bottom navigation bar.\n  \n*From the Purchased tab, tap the artist name for the content you intend to download again.\n  \n*Once you’ve located the music you are looking for, tap the download button.\n(If you want to download all songs from an album that you’ve\n  purchased, click on the button to swith to the “Album” view.)\n\nThis may or may not work for you, but it's worth a try.\n", "Q: Disabling Photo Stream with Shared Apple ID My kid's devices are tied to my Apple ID, and that's working wonderfully.  The problem is that anytime I take a photo on my iphone, it automatically appears on their ipads.  How do I disable that?\n\nA: If what you are trying to achieve is to give your kids' devices the ability to download apps that you purchased on your device(s), then you probably do not want to log them in to your iCloud account at all. Instead you need to go to the App Store settings, and enter your Apple ID in there, to allow the store to use your ID.\nThe advantage of this is that you can create each of your offspring an iCloud login of his/her very own, meaning that they can turn on iCloud backup without eating your storage, and to save their own Photo Stream, contacts, et cetera.\nAlso you can have them appear as different people under Find My Friends.\n\nA: From the way you phrased your question, it appears you may want to allow select photos to appear on their devices. If this is the case, the best solution is probably to disable Photo Stream on your children's devices, but leave Shared Photo Streams on. By disabling Photo Stream on their devices, it will prevent photos you take from automatically appearing there. However, by leaving Shared Photo Streams enabled, you can create a Shared Photo Stream and any photos you place in that will appear on their devices automatically. It's effectively manual curation for what they are able to see.\nTo disable Photo Stream on their devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app.\n\n*Tap on Photos & Camera.\n\n*Ensure \"Shared Photo Streams\" is set to On.\n\n*Slide the \"My Photo Stream\" toggle to the left to turn it off.\n\n\nIf you don't want them to use Photo Stream at all, turn off both Shared Photo Streams and My Photo Stream.\n\nA: Or it may be that you ONLY want them to use your Apple ID account to share apps but have no access to data in your iCloud account (Email, Photos, Contacts etc).\nThese things are actually completely seperate - just enter your AppleID under iTunes (in iPad settings) for Apps and remove it from iCloud.\nYou can even make them their own iCloud ID9\n", "Q: Does airplane-mode disable GPS? According to\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1355\n\nairplane-mode on the iPhone shuts off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ...GPS.  \nMy understanding is that GPS-devices only /receive/ GPS\nsignals, they don't transmit anything, so I don't\nunderstand why this needs to be shut down.  [Of course, if\nthe iPhone is running at all, then /it/ is emitting some\nRF, but I don't see why receiving GPS signals should cause\nan additional problem for the airplane.]\nI tested on an iPhone 3GS (IOS 6.1.3):  Enabled\nairplane-mode, then turned-off the phone.  Rotated the\nphone 180-degrees.  Turned it back on (with airplane-mode\nstill enabled).  The compass-app still seemed to find North.\nWould someone be willing to do an independent test of this?\n\nA: I think Airplane Mode disables the hardware chips. GPS and 3G/LTE are on the same chip. I would say, Airplane Mode also disables GPS.\n\nA: The existing answers are now outdated. Since iOS 8.2, you can still use the GPS even in flight mode. \nApple's statement says:\n\nIf you have a device with iOS 8.2 or earlier, Airplane Mode will also turn off GPS.\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204234\n\nA: Yes, airplane mode shuts down the radios that amplify all antenna circuitry. Compass isn't affected by airplane mode other than not being tuned by GPS location. Your observed relative changes will be mostly unaffected but absolute accuracy could suffer between one and ten degrees on much of the globe. \nOf course the GPS signals still hit the iPhone case and antennas, just the hardware doesn't do the work to fix a location from those signals while in airplane mode. (Nor does e software do any processing of the location updates which is a big part of the functionality for many people as opposed to the hardware side of the radios being idle / off / silent)\n\nA: The compass uses the Magnetometer/Gyroscope which doesn't require antennas (just a chip). So yes it still works in airplane mode. \n\nA: No, GPS only appears to be disabled in the native Apple Maps app. Using another map app such as Google Maps, you are still able to determine your location even with airplane mode on, wifi and bluetooth off.  \nTested in iOS 8.3 \n\nA: Yes, airplane mode disables GPS\n", "Q: How are colorschemes represented in OS X Terminal.app Settings Files? I'm interested in moving color values I've created for OS X Terminal to applications on other platforms, such as Linux. I'm familiar with the usual methods of representing color values like RGB, HSB, L*A*B, HEX, etc. However, the <data> strings used in Terminal settings files are unlike other methods used to define colors. I'd like help understanding this XML <data> type in relation to other color values.\nAs an example, I used OS X's built-in Color Picker to manually change Terminal's default ANSI scheme with HSB values from Ethan Schoonover's excellent Solarized. I then saved those settings in an XML .plist called Solarized Dark xterm-256color.terminal (The contents of that file may be found here.)\nI arbitrarily chose brblack from that file as a single color value for comparison:\n    <key>ANSIBrightBlackColor</key>\n    <data>\n    YnBsaXN0MDDUAQIDBAUGFRZYJHZlcnNpb25YJG9iamVjdHNZJGFyY2hpdmVyVCR0b3AS\n    AAGGoKMHCA9VJG51bGzTCQoLDA0OVU5TUkdCXE5TQ29sb3JTcGFjZVYkY2xhc3NOMCAw\n    LjE2NDUgMC4yMQAQAoAC0hAREhNaJGNsYXNzbmFtZVgkY2xhc3Nlc1dOU0NvbG9yohIU\n    WE5TT2JqZWN0XxAPTlNLZXllZEFyY2hpdmVy0RcYVHJvb3SAAQgRGiMtMjc7QUhOW2Jx\n    c3V6hY6WmaK0t7wAAAAAAAABAQAAAAAAAAAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvg==\n    </data>\n\nThis looks much different (and more complex) than the simple HSB value 193 100 21  taken from Schoonover's table:\n    SOLARIZED HEX     16/8 TERMCOL  XTERM/HEX   L*A*B      RGB         HSB\n    --------- ------- ---- -------  ----------- ---------- ----------- -----------\n    base03    #002b36  8/4 brblack  234 #1c1c1c 15 -12 -12   0  43  54 193 100  21\n    ...\n\nWhy does the simple value 193 100 21 get converted into a data string 5 lines long?

On the iPhone, I can view it using\nthe built-in PhotoApp [I don't know its official name].\nOn the iPhone: Can I access this photo via a local URL, e.g\nfile:///Uploaded/dog.jpg\n?\nMore Generally:  I'm looking for a way to put several links in\na single Contacts entry.

Of course each image is stored at some path, but it's better for apps to use the photo API to access photos than to depend on a file URL as you describe. \n", "Q: Can a MBP 15'' early 2011 run DDR3L ram?

I've got new videos that I took with my iPod Touch that are in the H.264 format, so they transfer fine, of course. \nHow can I convert my MJPEG videos so that I can transfer them to my iPod? I assume I'd need to convert them to H.264 somehow. Is it possible to convert them, and keep the metadata associated with them as well, especially the date that the videos were taken?\n\nA: Probably need to use QuickTime for this (or maybe iMovie if you prefer) -- as far as built-in solutions go. There's a built-in setting in qt to export for iPod touch (as well as settings for other devices) using h.264. \n", "Q: iCloud keeps signing in after I sign out iCloud always... ALWAYS crash all my apps (Pages, Keynote, SimpleText, etc) that use iCloud so if I turn off iCloud, the apps run fine. Apps just cannot open documents at all. \nHere's what's getting my goat: I signed off iCloud in System Preference on Mac OSX Mountain Lion but every time I open the System Preference, it shows that it's already signed in! That's how I know apps aren't working if I use them again in few minutes. Something is wrong. I have to keep signing out every time I open System Preferences.  \nI want to totally disable iCloud and removed from MacOSX if possible. I don't want photosteam, I don't want data shared in the cloud.  \n\nA: Rather than fuss with each of the settings within iCloud, you might want to delete the entire account using System Preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail, Contacts & Calendars and delete all iCloud accounts.\n\n*Open iCloud Preference Pane and press Sign Out\n\n\nThe first step won't delete anything that's already stored in the cloud, only items on the local computer. The second step will also only delete local content and erase any of the certificates, keys and other things that tie a computer to iCloud servers. At that point, I would reboot and then check your Mac for other issues (disk utility to check the disk catalog once you boot into Recovery HD) and then decide if things are stable again.\nSpecifically, you might have corruption in the preference file that stores iCloud log in credentials. You can test this by making a new account on the Mac and then signing in and out of the same iCloud account.\nThat will isolate the error to either your iCloud account (meaning you contact Apple support to get the account cleared up) or the error is the user account on the Mac (meaning you back up the Mac and set that user up / restore the files that are not corrupted).\n\nA: Repair permissions just didn't work - it keeps going on and on... it seems like it froze. Apparently, there's some issues with permissions. I had to get a different drive and reinstall MacOSX... and even with that, the Migration Assistant didn't work - it couldn't migrate apps. So, I had to re-download all apps. \nI am happy to report that I am STILL able to get user data from the original drive and instead of using my local hard drive with slow transfer rate, I got an external SSD drive to work as a boot drive and it works.. fast! \n\nA: Are you using multiple accounts on the Mac? Two accounts will fight with one another, especially if both are registered to one Apple ID.\nIf so, I'd suggest\n1) Disconnecting from the internet/wifi entirely to ensure synced prefs aren't causing this\n2) Sign out of iCloud entirely on both (or all) accounts\n3) Restart the Mac\n4) Log into the individual accounts i.e. log into one, check iCloud is still \"Signed Out\", log out, then the others, repeat\n5) Reconnect back to the internet and do a final reboot for good measure\nHopefully that will help.\nIt's a bit round-about, but iCloud is pretty persistent when it comes to it's settings when there's multiple accounts!\nedit\nAnother thing that comes to mind is the password.\nWhen you set up a user account, you get to choose your own username/password or use your iCloud account. If the latter, you won't have much of a choice until you change your login details to something other than iCloud.\n\nA: Turn off/delete all iCloud services/accounts.\nTrash the entire contents of Macintosh HD/library/caches and Your_Username/Library/Caches (may have to enable the 'Show Library Folder' option in finder view options when looking at your user folder)\nEmpty the Trash - if it doesn't allow you to, reboot, then empty trash.\nReboot again\n", "Q: iMac doesn't start, all i see is colored lines and then checkered lines on a white background I have iMac 2010 which is out of warranty. I recently came up to the computer and it was sleeping and was not waking up. I held the powered button for a while, so it turned off. Then I pressed it again. The iMac turned on, but I saw colored lines on the white background with apple logo and activity indicator spinning. It was spinning for a bit then the screen changed to checkered color lines and white background, and it froze that way. I turned on my TV that the iMac is connected to and all I see there is white screen. I tried cmd+Option+P+R and it did restart, but same thing happened. I also tried plugging out all the cables, including power. Waiting for few minutes and plugging them back in, but that didn't help. What else can i try? Do you think the monitor is dead or the video card? Hopefully not the hard drive. Here are the screen shots of what happens:\n\n\n\nUpdate.\nI am trying to do as little as possible, not to loose the data. I don't have much backed up.\nI found the diagnostic CD and was able to run it. I ran the quick test and it found no issues. Now I am running the extended test. Would the extended test detect bad video card? I tried to start the iMac in Safe Mode with the same result. What are my choices, if it is the video card? To change it I would probably have to replace the whole motherboard, and Apple will charge I am sure over $300 if not more. Is there a way to boot from a flash drive to let's say Ubuntu and access the hard drive? \nHere is the screen shot from that Diagnostic screen:\n\n\nA: What you show us here are typical symptoms of a dead video card. \n", "Q: Install Unison, simple way Is there any simple way to install Unison (text version), on OSX?\nOn Ubuntu it's 'sudo apt-get install unison'.\nAnd that's it.\nI have read the following guide: http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/freebsd/distfiles/unison-2.45.28/unison-2.45.28-manual.pdf\nit's on page 8, lower half. But it strikes me as strange for they claim unix systems to need this complex procedure for installing as I have clearly seen none of this is necessary on Ubuntu. Therefore I wonder if there is not a comparably simple procedure available for OSX. \n\nA: The difference is that you are using a pre-built package under Linux but are looking at the compile-it-yourself instructions (which would work both for Linux and for OS X).\nThere are at least two options to solve that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use one of the package managers available for OS X, e.g. Homebrew and install Unison by running\nbrew install unison\n\nYou will need Xcode installed as well for this\n\n*Follow the \"Download\" link on http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison and download pre-compiled versions from here.\n\n\nA: MacPorts works perfect for me if you don't mind the general MacPorts principle of keeping many system libraries in additional versions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MacPorts\n\n*sudo port install unison\nMacports will download binaries for most setups of OSX but can in some cases download source code and compile it. If it can use the binary which is on a Macports' server it will not matter that the source code server is down.\n\nA: You can easily download binaries from http://alan.petitepomme.net/unison/index.html . This is a reliable source and is even linked to from the Unison project page.\nThis is the full GUI for Mac, once you run the app it will ask you to install the command line tools.  When you allow this it will put unison in /usr/bin/ .  From the command line you can then call the text version with the following command:\nunison -ui text\n\nThis will then run unison with the default.prf that should be in the ~/Library/Application Support/Unison/ folder.\n", "Q: Automator: Issue with nested folders Can anybody explain how can I do this: \nAdd to context menu in finder element nested folders which contains of :\nnested folders\n - template one\n     - template two\n     - template three\nand each element will create a nested structure of folder in current directory.\nSo, if I choose in nested folders->template one, it will create in current directory nested structure of folders with template one.  \nWhat I did?  \nI made new Service for Automator.\nAdd action 'Create new Folder'  \nEverything works fine, but I can't understand how to tell Automator to create nested empty directories.\nWhat Automator did instead?\nSuppose I choose folder '/pathToFolder/ParentFolder/SourceFolder'.\nIf I select 'Folder' and hit 'makeNewCustomFolder', Automator would create a 'CustomFolder' like this:\n'/pathToFolder/ParentFolder/CustomFolder' - on the same level of 'SourceFolder'.\nBut also Automator copy content of 'SourceFolder' into 'CustomFolder'\n\nA: The way to create nested folder structures is probably AppleScript, not Automator. I don't think Automator can create nested folder structures as easily as AppleScript.\nThe following AppleScript creates a folder structure of the form\n- My first folder\n  - A folder within my first folder\n    - Another folder within both of those\n\nwithin the frontmost folder in Finder. Here it is:\ntry\n  tell application \"Finder\" to set FOLDER0 to (folder of the front window as alias)\nend try\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n  set folder1 to make new folder at FOLDER0 with properties {name:\"My first folder\"}\n  set folder2 to make new folder at folder1 with properties {name:\"A folder within my first folder\"}\n  set folder3 to make new folder at folder2 with properties {name:\"Another folder within both of those\"}\nend tell\n\nI've deliberately tried to keep it basic. All the structure is declared in the second tell block, and hopefully it should be easy to see how to extend it. If you want to test if before attaching it to a service, copy and paste it into AppleScript Editor (in the Utilities folder).\nThis script is fairly naive, and throws an error if the folders already exist. If that's a case you might be working with, then this question on Stack Overflow explains how to modify a script like this and only create folders that don't already exist.\nIf you want to create lots of folders with similar names (folder001, folder002, ..., folder999), then this forum thread on Apple Insider may be helpful.\nYou then want to bind this to a service in Automator (which I see from the question you know how to do). The service should receive folders in Finder, and you use the Run AppleScript action to run the script.\nOnce you've got that service installed, you can right-click on a folder in the Finder, and there'll be a service which creates this structure for you.\n\nTo get the different templates, I can think of two methods.\nYou could create multiple services (\"Create nested folders 1\", \"Create nested folders 2\", …). But that seems rather messy. Again, AppleScript is our friend. We can make a dialog that looks like this appear:\n\nand which option we choose dictates which folder structure gets created. Here's the relevant code:\nset choice to choose from list {\"template1\", \"template2\", \"template3\"}\n\ntry\n  tell application \"Finder\" to set FOLDER0 to (folder of the front window as alias)\nend try\n\nif choice is \"template1\" then\n  -- create some folders\nend if\n\nif choice is \"template2\" then\n  -- create some different folders\nend if\n\nif choice is \"template3\" then\n  -- create a third set of folders\nend if\n\nReplace the lines starting with -- with the folder generating code that we discussed above. The list in the first line gives you a list of choices, and then you create an if block for each choice that generates the appropriate folder structure.\nIf you use this AppleScript in Automator, then the procedure is exactly the same, except now you get the choice when you run the service in Finder.\n", "Q: Macbook sometimes drops my wifi connection and can't reconnect for a few minutes Every now and then my macbook will drop my home wifi connection and the network will not be visible in the list of available networks for a few minutes leaving me unable to reconnect. Eventually my network reappears and I reconnect and it works again. I don't believe it to be a router issue as my iPad and iPhone never have this problem and I still have a working connection on them even when my mac cannot see the network.\nI live on a street where there are quite a few neighbour's wifi networks within range of my PC. I have experimented with a number of different wifi channels on the router but it hasn't solved the issue. Any ideas?\nThe router is a Virgin Media \"Super Hub\" (some sort of Netgear)\n\nA: If you were to run the Wireless Diagnostic tool each time the network dropped, you might be able to look over the logs once you have 5 to 10 events and see if you can determine a pattern. It's hidden in the folder /System/Library/CoreServices/ and also available if you hold the option key and click on the wireless icon in the menu bar.\nOnce the tool runs and deposits the diagnostic data on your desktop - you might run it a second time and use the Utilities window to see if you can see interference or other issues on the Performance view.\n\nThat section where the noise jumped up was when I turned on our Microwave.\n", "Q: Can't do in-app purchase in my new iPad Mini I just switched my old iPad to iPad Mini. When I'm on my old iPad, in-app purchases work fine, as well as with my iPhone 5 (they all use the same Apple ID).\nHow to make in-app purchases work on the iPad Mini?\n\nA: Usually, when one device will not perform in app purchase, it's a setting under restrictions.\nIf you've checked and disabled that restriction or all restrictions - you can often fix this by signing out of the App Store entirely and powering down the device. When it starts cleanly, you can log in again. When you sign in, be sure to buy something (a free song of the week, a free app or even a paid app) to get through the verification questions. Once that's done, recheck an IAP (in-app purchase) to be sure things are functional.\nAs a last resort, you might need to contact Apple Support for Apple ID - but most times you can fix this without needing their help.\n", "Q: Can't access specific websites with Macbook Air (10.7.5 Lion) This has really baffled me:\nWhile my internet connection works, I can't access specific websites with Safari (or any other browser for that matter).

I'm not using any proxies like Little Snitch, and a quick search for malware came up clean.\n\nA: For such problem one more option is there where you can check your DNS settings. \nTo fix that problem, open the Network pane of System Preferences and select your network connection in the list on the left. Click Advanced followed by DNS. \nIn the DNS Servers field, you should see one or more IP addresses. If those addresses are enabled (black, as opposed to gray), select each one in turn and click the minus-sign (-) button. Then, regardless of whether there are already addresses there in gray, click the plus-sign (+) button and enter 208.67.222.220; repeat with 208.67.222.222.\nSome more Ipv4 and Ipv6 addresses are given at computerknow.org, you may see there.\n\nA: I'm in the same boat. \nI've tried deleting cache and cookies, but it did't work for me.\nAfter surfing some websites, I found some tips that worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences,choose network\n\n*Click \"advanced\", go to the \"Hardware\" tab, and click on \"configure\", choose \"manually\"\n\n*Click on mtu, change it to \"custom\" and set the mtu number to 1453 (I dont why but the number is something like a networking secret from ancient times)\n\n\nA: Here's a solution that helped me - I was desperate as nothing I had done had helped, the problem was only specific to my macbook (other devices connected just fine) and across browsers.\nAfter speaking with three different assistants from Apple Support, the third of which stayed with me on shared screen for over an hour trying to help me resolve this, I bumped into a solution on my own, so I'm sharing it here in case it helps other people:\nFirst back-up (just in case) and then delete the following folder:\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\nThen, reboot (and the system will re-create the folder with default settings.)\nYou will have to enter your network's credentials again (password etc). \nIt worked for me.\nBefore that I couldn't access certain google services (youtube, docs, drive) although others worked fine (google.com, gmail.) After this, I could access everything just like normal.\nThe weirdest thing was that, I don't remember doing anything in particular that caused this to happen yesterday (when the problems started) so I have no idea what exactly went wrong - all I know was that deleting all the configuration files sorted it out.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I had the sam problem (www.apple.com, www.facebokok.com etc did not load).\nDisabling of IPv6 in network settings helped me.

However, after 60 GB of swap space are used, I get the following complaint from OS X 10.8.4:\n\nOS X startup disk has no more space available for application memory\n\nAt this stage the RAM is fully used and virtual memory is used up to ~60 GBm as well as the swap, which Activity Monitor reports is around 60 GB.\nI tried this program on two different Macs with the same outcome and the same critical amount of swap where everything goes wrong.\nMy machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Pro\n\n*Two quad core 2.7 GHz processors\n\n*32 GB of RAM\n\n*1.3 TB of free hard-disk space\n\n\nI checked my handcoded C++ program for leaks using Xcode and I understand where the RAM usage is coming from.\nI would be glad if anybody has a suggestion what the root of my problem is.\n\nA: Absolutely run sysdiagnose the next time you run out of disk space so that you can find out which processes are leaking memory (and/or just using all that RAM). As the commenter above stated on the question - this is clearly something amiss with one or more programs and not something that should happen routinely.\n", "Q: My CPU is running slow after a system restore (4x0.8 GHz). Turbo Boost is definitely not working. And how can I fix it? Last weekend, my Macbok Air suffered a heart attack and I ended up doing several hard shutdowns due to an unresponsive system. In the end I had to do a full system restoration.\nEverything is working fine now except for one thing: The CPU is slow. Much slower.\nCPU related computing is much slower than before, even though I can't tell for sure how much exactly. When running Ubuntu, I monitor the clock speed and see that all four cores are running constantly at 0.8 GHz. The same is true for OS X when using the Intel Power Gadget. It used to be 1.8GHz to 2.6GHz. (Macbook Air 5-2, i5-3427U)\n\n$ sudo modprobe msr ; sudo turbostat\ncor CPU    %c0  GHz \n         11.50 0.80 \n  0   0  13.34 0.80 \n  0   2   7.76 0.80 \n  1   1  18.47 0.80 \n  1   3   6.44 0.80 \n\nCould this be a software related issue? What should I do then?\nI guess you see that a hidden assumption is that the firmware is corrupted. This is why I tried to reinstall the latest firmware for my Mac from https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1237. But when I install that file I get the error: \"This software is not supported on your system.\" Most probably because the latest firmware version is already installed.\n\nA: Using the Intel power gadget (above) shows your CPU running at low speed.\nIn normal case that would be fine if there is no load.\nI have MBA with 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 and runs at 0.85 at normal use, how ever it does spikes to 1.8 + under load.\nSince the computer processing speed depends on more than one factor (CPU +SSD read/Write+RAM)...\nI would say you (your mac) is a candidate for the Apple Hardware test.\nUPDATE:\nIf you have a faulty battery (as reported by your hardware test based) then your Mac will automatically limit the CPU speed to about 1/2 (as designed by Apple.)\nSo fix the battery and you good to go.\n", "Q: Email contacts in iPhone contacts When logging into hotmail on the mail app, do all contacts save into the contact list on the iPhone? Or only certain ones? If so how? \n\nA: It depends on how you have the account setup in your iPhone Mail settings. \nFrom: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook-to-go\n\niPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch Tap Settings, and then tap Mail, Contacts, Calendar.\nTap Add Account in the Accounts page.\nSelect Hotmail.\nEnter your Outlook.com address and password.\nSelect the fields that you want to sync. Tap Save.\n\nThat last step is where you decide whether you want to sync contacts, calendars, etc or just mail. If you choose to sync contacts, it syncs all contacts. There is no way to selectively sync contacts.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2011 Snow Leopard Boot Camp with Parallels Desktop 8 Quick question in response to a very thorough bootcamp post already on this forum.\nFor anybody that has a working Mac, Windows and Shared partition ... is the Boot Camp partition recognised by Parallels Desktop?\nI ask because I wanted to make use of Parallels Desktop integration feautres, but despite getting a working multi-boot between Mac and Windows with additional shared partition ... Parallels Desktop would not find Boot Camp, but would try installing itself onto the Windows partition - and fail).\nIf I removed the shared partition and Windows to the default single Mac partition, then partition split using Boot Camp Assisitant, Parallels Desktop would recognize Boot Camp and install itself onto Windows partition properly (only I then have no shared partition).\nSoon as I try breaking up partitions beyond this Boot Camp Assistant default (despite getting multi-boot working) Parallels seems unable to use the Windows partition (always hangs and gives various boot errors) though the Windows partition will multi-boot.\nThe only way I have been able to check that Boot Camp is setup right for Parallels Desktop integration, is to go into Parallels Desktop and create new file ... Boot Camp partition option and icon are then available. If Boot Camp is there in Parallels Desktop, then I can load and use that partition with Parallels Desktop. Otherwise, Parallels Desktop fails to integrate despite having a working bootable Windows partition.\nReminder to self: working multi boot != working boot camp\nUltimately, I'm back to starting with default Mac partition and Boot Camp Asssitant-created Windows partition without additional shared partition. This works for Parallels Desktop integration each time, but cannot fathom how to then create a shared partition.\n\nA: Found the solution and can confirm that the bootcamp works with Parallels (with additional shared drive): https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3293948\n", "Q: Reading a Mac IICi and SE hard drive on another computer I have a Macintosh IICi and SE hard drive. My understanding is both are SCSI. I know one of the two is a Quantum P40S (the one from the mac IICi) I also have a PowerMac G4 that works very nicely and has an airport card in it.\nThe G4 has a PCI SCSI card. It is an adaptec 2930CU scsi card. I believe it came with the G4.\nNow I also have a third hard drive. This drive is an old mac SCSI Hard drive, 50 MB I believe. I am not sure what machine it originally came from. I have gotten it to play nice with my PCI scsi card. I connect it using some ribbon cable and the four large pin internal power cable and everything is fine. That is, the SCSI hard drive is not being put external to the computer. Hence, I am confident my SCSI pci card works.\nNow when I remove this third, working SCSI hard drive and attach either the IICi hard drive or the SE hard drive, I get nothing. Interestingly, both of these hard drives have a small LED that attaches to the front of the drive. At no point during my testing does this light show any activity. I also do not feel the drives ever spin.\nI would guess that there is some power issue. \nWould anyone know if there is anything in particular I should be doing to work with IICi or SE SCSI internal hard drives? Are there jumpers, perhaps, that I need to assign somewhere? What about SCSI terminators? Did internal SCSI hard drives require some internal SCSI terminator. I am left confused on this matter because the third, working hard drive, required no special treatment.\nUpdate 1\nI have found that internal mac SCSI HDs have a built in terminator ( I guess you can't put more than one on the bus).\nFrom this old Apple support page:\n\nIf the Macintosh in the SCSI\n  chain DOES have an internal hard drive, terminate only the other end\n  of the SCSI chain. (All Apple internal SCSI hard drives have built-in\n  terminators).\n\nSo this answers the terminator issue. Thus I am still unsure as to why this isn't working.\nUpdate 2\nI have gotten a hold of an adaptec 2940UW and the requisite mac firmware. I've also obtained the Adaptec PowerDomain Control program and SCSIProbe 5.1.2.\nThe hard drive is indeed detected on the SCSI bus of my Adaptec 2940UW. The problem is mounting. I get the following error message from SCSIProbe 5.1.2 when attempting to mount:\nTrying Device 1.0.0:\n   FAILED: SCSI error: -7932 (2) Sense: 1 (0)\n\nTrying Device 1.0.1:\n   FAILED: Logical units not supported\n\nWould anyone know how to interpret these messages?\n\nA: Since the old drives aren't spinning up, don't worry about the SCSI card, data cable, or jumper settings; all they should need to spin up is power (i.e. that 4-pin connector). Since the 50MB drive is working off the G4's power connection, I'm pretty sure that's OK... Which leaves problems with the drives themselves.\nMany of those older drives were prone to stiction and similar problems. Essentially, the main spindle and platters would get stuck in place, and the spindle motor wasn't strong enough to spin it up. There were a variety of tricks for breaking them free, most of which involved some risk of damaging the drive beyond repair (like tapping the drive juuuuust so, or opening the mechanism and forcing the spindle \"by hand\").\nProbably the safest thing to try would be refrigerating the drives (be sure to keep them dry -- no condensation!), then spinning them up cold. I had the most luck with spinning the drive in my hand -- the trick here is that you want to spin it flat, that is, spin it around the axis of rotation of the platters. If you're having trouble picturing what I'm talking about, don't do it, because spinning it on the wrong axis could easily make things worse. Actually, even spinning it on the right axis could make things worse; I make no promises at all.\nIt might also help if you can figure out the manufacturer of the other drive. If it's a MiniScribe 8425SA, I recommend a stake through the heart.\n", "Q: macbook pro not detecting projector I have a MBP that suddenly stopped detecting an external projector. I have used the same laptop with the same projector before. Right now when I boot the same laptop to the Windows partition it works fine with the projector, so I don't think it is a hardware problem. Any suggestions as to what to try? I have tried the \"detect displays\" trick and that doesn't seem to work.\n\nA: I would say it's your adaptor. I had the exact same behaviour. Changed the cables over and it started working again. \nI've had it happen on HDMI cable and mini display port/thunderbolt adaptor. \n\nA: Thanks all. Turns out it is indeed an adapter problem. \nFor the record, the broken adapter did work for connecting windows partition to the projector, and also for both mac and windows connecting to an external monitor.\nAnd also, even when it works, ioreg -l didn't list the projector's name in the output.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Mountain Lion Server? Ok, so, here's my situation:\nI had Mavericks running on my computer, and I managed to downgrade (ugh). Anyways, all my OS X server data was corrupted because OS X Server 10.8 attempted to \"fix\" it, when it had no idea what this 10.9 magic was. So, I executed a simple rm -rf /Library/Server and used AppZappr to wipe all plist's from the computer, except for the .app. However, it goes and tries to recover that data. It now cannot read any preference data for any service. How can I remove the whole thing so it thinks it is a new install?\n\nA: After trying numerous things, a full zap using AppZappr and deleting the /Library/Server folder allowed me to reinstall the app from the App Store and re set it up. :)\n", "Q: How do I retrieve songs hidden in the iCloud with iTunes 11.0.4? My younger sister bought a few pop songs on my mom's computer (which is not an Apple but she has iTunes on it), and because of the iCloud they showed up on my computer as well. I really can't stand her songs (I've always been a major classic rock fan), so I deleted them from my Mac not knowing that they would also delete them from my mom's computer. Then she and my mom got mad that her songs were deleted, so I looked up how to retrieve them. I went to the iTunes store > Account Information > iTunes in the Cloud, but the only thing there was \"Manage Devices\" and \"iTunes Match.\" There's no option to view hidden songs in between those two options, like it's supposed to. I just updated iTunes so that I have iTunes 11.0.4, but it still doesn't show up. Is there anything else I can do? I really don't want to re-buy her songs.\n\nA: 1) Open iTunes\n2) Go to Store\n3) Go to Music Tab\n4) On the Right Hand Side should be a link \"Purchased\" - click that.\n5) Then \"Recent Purchases\"\n6) Click on the little cloud icon to redownload what you want.\nHowever you should be able to delete from your computer without affecting music on other computers so I am confused by your description of the problem.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open up iTunes\n\n*Highlight \"Music\" in the Sidebar\n\n*Click on \"View\" in the Menu Bar (that will open a drop-down menu)\n\n*Go down the drop down menu and click on \"Show Music in the Cloud\"\n\n*Your songs/albums will now be visible.\n\n\nA: Look for it in iTunes Store and buy it again. Once you add your information it will tell you that you have already bought it and that you can download it from free (press download to download it again for free)\n", "Q: Why won't my Time Capsule extend my wireless network? I'm trying to get my 2009-era Time Capsule to extend my home wireless network (broadcast by a non-Apple router). I reset the Time Capsule and AirPort Utility can see it on both my iPad mini (iOS 6.1.3) and my Mac Mini (OSX 10.8.2). In both cases, AirPort Utility will happily allow me to set up the Time Capsule and have it join my existing network. When I go back and tell AirPort Utility to have it extend my wireless network, the Time Capsule tries to update itself and then just fails. It tells me \"An error occurred during the update\", and then AirPort Express can no longer see the Time Capsule:\n\nAt this point, I restore the Time Capsule using the tiny button on the back and lather, rinse, repeat. \nThe Time Capsule hadn't been used in a few months, so I tried this both before and after updating the firmware. There has been no change in the result. \nWhere do I even begin to troubleshoot?\n\nA: The Time Capsule can only \"extend\" a wireless signal....using wireless only....from another AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, or AirPort Express.\nApple is doing this in a proprietary way and non Apple hardware is not supported.\nIn any case WiFi extension is generally flaky and to be avoided. I strongly recommend you look into using Powerline plugs like these to reliably get network connections into distant rooms:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Ethernet-Powerline-Wall-Plug-Adapter-Starter/dp/B00D7GF5MM\n\nA: Ok, I think I understand what you're trying to do, because I've done the same. The answers listed aren't 100% accurate.\nIf what you're saying you're wanting to do is say receive the \"internet connection signal\" (i.e. dsl, cable, fiber optic) from it's respective carrier & then direct it through the Time Capsule in hopes to solely extend their signal then the answers above are essentially accurate. I say essentially because based on some carriers newer router-modem combos, you CAN set up the Time Capsule in bridge mode and allow it to work as a repeater (or extend your network.) Often, with the older Time Capsules and many carriers it just becomes a pain & simply doesn't play nice all the time if you do get it to work.\nIt seemed to me though that wasn't exactly what you were asking to do. It seemed/sounded like you just wanted to take the signal, bounce it to the TC then to the Express. If that's the case it can be done, without any extra purchases. Certainly without any addition of a wireless jack extension, which no offense to the individual recommending it, but would be a really silly option in this scenario.\n\n\n*\n\n*Place the Time Capsule next to the carrier's (i.e. I have my Uverse fiber optic modem next to my 2011 Time Capsule.)\n\n*Then connect the 2 via an ethernet port. At that time what you'll want to go through your carrier's step to disable the carrier's wireless signal.\n\n*Then allow your Time Capsule to serve as your Wireless router. You may want to go through the Air-Port Utility Set up. \n\n*Then connect your Airport Express & it will allow me you to then \"extend\" the network from the Time Capsule.\n\n\nThe great thing is the Airport Express offers you incredible flexibility due its portability. I know with mine I get a pretty good signal without it but with it, I can put it out on the back patio and enjoy streaming music. I have a friend who enjoys doing a movie night once a month in the summer & uses the same set-up to stream movies from their Apple TV to their projector in the driveway on to the garage. It's really cool. All the kids in the neighborhood and families get together for an old fashion block-party of sorts in drive-in movie style. All thanks to a well set up network. I hope that helps answer your question.\n\nA: If you are trying to extend a wireless network that is not an Apple Airport base station it cannot be done. You can join a network but this will not increase the range of your wireless network. \nUnless you have a firmware that supports WDS on your 3rd party wireless router. \n", "Q: Will I miss something if I uninstall Growl off Mountain Lion? I updated to Mountain Lion more than a year ago.\nEven before that, Growl has been annoying me with a pop-up asking me to update. \nThe new version is costs 4 USD in the App Store.\nSince ML has notifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I care for Growl anymore ?\n\n*Would I'll be missing something if I unistall Growl ?\n\n\nA: I was an avid user of Growl before Mountain Lion. I started a fresh install without growl and all my apps that were using growl have been updated to use the built in notifications. \nUnless there is something specific you need from the growl features I doubt you'll miss it. \n", "Q: Help me reset the terminal after sudo command mistake I recently installed a cracked version of a program and it instructed me to block outgoing connections by following the instructions below.\nStep 1\nClick the \"Go\" menu, select \"Utilities,\" and then double-click \"Terminal\" to launch the utility.\nStep 2\nType \"sudo cp /private/etc/hosts ~/Documents/hosts-backup\" (omit the quotes here and throughout) to create a backup of the \"hosts\" file before editing. You can open this file later if you find the changes you made to your system resulted in unintended behaviors.\nStep 3\nType \"sudo nano /private/etc/hosts\" in the Terminal window, and then press the \"Enter\" key. \"Sudo\" indicates that you want to gain administrator access, \"nano\" tells Terminal the program to use -- in this case, the Nano text editor -- and the pathname indicates the location of the \"hosts\" file.\nStep 4\nType your administrator account password, and then press the \"Enter\" key. You must set up a password for your account to make changes in Terminal.

I'm too tired to keep trying to figure this out.\n\nA: Factory Reset\nI ended up doing a Factory Reset to clear off the \"Other\" data. \nThe key is that since the Other seemed to be backup related, I did not restore the phone from the backup. Instead, I selected \"As a new phone\". \nOne by one, I added back her apps, music and photos, watching the Other bar like a hawk. \nThe Other data remains virtually gone now only taking up 430Mb.\n\nA: Go to:\n1) Settings App\n2) General Tab\n3) Usage \nYou should get a list of the top 10 storage consumers - does that help?\nPS Is the phone Jail Broken? Could be some funny stuff being loaded on the 'dark side'... That storage would not be recognised by iTunes and could be responsible for what you describe.\n\nA: I have read that Messages contribute to 'Other' and typically Messages are kept for ever...\nIf your daughter was at all typical in her use you could have 100,000 messages (many with pictures?) on the phone.\nTry going into Messages and deleting all the conversations except the most recent and see if that helps?\n\nA: I've pinpointed this to be mail related - specifically the time duration you're syncing mail.

Mac (and PC) users tend to use spaces and other naughty characters in filenames so you can't rely on unix to \"do the right thing\" all the time.  This works better IMHO:\nfind / -uid 501 -print | while read file; do chown 1000 \"$file\"; done\n\nIt is regrettably slower but has the advantage of not being tripped up by spaces and other non-unix filename characters.\n\nA: I had installed Debian Linux on my mac, and wanted the ownership of the files on my macOS to be the same as that on Debian so I wouldn't have problems accessing them from Debian.\nThis worked for me to change my uid from 501 to 1000, and didn't break anything(default UID under debian is 1000).\nWith one change: under macOS 10.4.11 find doesn't recognize -uid\nuse -user instead.\n", "Q: iPhoto \"passworded folder\" mechanism In iPhoto, I have all pictures I've ever taken, or opened from my email.\nIt includes, for example, pictures of my gf showing me the underwear she is hesitating to buy, or anything else I might not be willing to show while streaming through the pics with a few friends.\nIs there any way I could, without entirely deleting these pictures, turn some security on, as if they were in a passworded folder?\nIt seems some privacy/security feature must be available in such a massively used software, but I can't find it...\n\nA: One option would be to have multiple iPhoto libraries, and keep one on an encrypted Disk Image.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an encrypted disk image in Disk Utility, or some other utility. This might be a good use for Knox, which lets you easily create an encrypted disk image and unlock it and mount it when you want.\n\n*When you open iPhoto, hold down the ⌥ (Option) key and you will be asked to select which iPhoto library you want to open.\n\n\nA: There is no way to password protect individual photos or albums from someone who has access to your account.\nThat said, if you are going to be the one scrolling through the photos, you can right-click on any image and choose \"Hide\".

I used DaisyDisk to get info about my drive. I found a folder named \".git\" in my documents. Its size is about 15 GB. what is it? and can I delete it? \n\nA: Git is a version control system and stores the history in a subdirectory .git\nThat is a way of keeping copies of snapshots source code or other documents in a way so that you can go to the complete set of documents at an earlier given time and/or see when and who changed a file and what change was made. \nA version control system can be used just for your documents or put in a shared place so people who collaborate all can see and make changes.\nYou can use tools like SourceTree to view what is in your history.\nThus is you are not using git you can delete the .git directory but I would ask how did it get there. It is possible that another application could use git, I would see if any of your apps say they keep old copies of data however I would hope that they would not do this for all of ~/Documents as this would mess up other peoples' use of this directory. The actual directory .git is in would help to identify the application using it.\n", "Q: Determine the location of a shared folder in Win7 I am now using Mac OS 10.8, and want to write a script (.sh) to copy some files from Mac to the shared folder of a Win7 computer.

Then the folder name is in the title of the window and this is the path yo use in your script. \nNote you can also use automator and applescript rather than shell scripts.\n\nA: All shares and removable drives automatically get mounted in /Volumes/<share path>.\nTo show the path of a share in finder you can either right click on the title of the finder window to open a path list leading to the current location.\nYou can also show the full path in finder by running the following two commands in terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool YES\nkillall Finder \n", "Q: MacBook Pro 15'' RAM Question I own a MacBook Pro 15 Late 2011 and I bought it for my work which involves crazy amounts of photoshoping every day. As PS is always hungry for RAM I bought 2 8Gb SODIMM modules to replace 4Gb modules that was factory installed.\nI've tried to put 8Gb modules inside (which I've done before like 1*10^6 times before with other macs) and for some reason only one of them worked so I thought: \"Ok maybe one of them is faulty I'll send it back\", and I did. So after all I've upgraded my MBP15 from 8Gb to 12Gb of RAM.\nNow (after one year LOL) I've suddenly realized that this 12Gigs is not enough for me and I want more. I started to search to buy a new 8Gb module to install it. Along with that, I've checked the google and found out that my MBP15 Late 2011 supports only 8Gb at max\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270?viewlocale=en_US\n(context links don't work so just cmd+F and search for \"15-inch, Late 2011\")\nSo my questions are:\n1. How it is possible for me to have 12Gb (8+4) right now? Is it safe?\n2. Is it possible to boost it to 16Gb (8+8)?\n3. Did anyone successfully boost MBP15 to 16Gb? If so please share the instructions.\nI guess the other 8Gb I've sent back was not faulty and MB refused to work with it? Or I don't know ... I'm confused.\n\nA: The 2011 Mac MacBook Pros have an Apple specified (as you found) maximum amount of RAM as 8GB.  The \"real world\" tests all show that the 2011 MacBook Pros actually have a maximum amount of 16GB of RAM.  See below for several examples.  This has been somewhat common practice for Apple over the years, where there specs will show a maximum of X but the real world tests and reviews all confirm a maximum of Y.\nYour initial 8GB DIMM was probably faulty.  Had it been functioning properly your Mac should have recognized all 16GB of memory.  There are no technical reasons or firmware restrictions that would keep your Mac from recognizing the full 16GB.\nOther World Computing's RAM upgrade page for this machine\nCrucial's RAM upgrade page for this machine\nEveryMac's spec page for this machine showing official & unofficial RAM specs\n\nA: My experience, with an early 2011 15 inches MBP are:\n16 Gigs of ram are (1) fine, (2) seen in full, (3) not a problem.\nTo get the machine to use 16GB RAM I (1) opened the machine (2) put 2 8GB RAM modules, (3) closed the machine, and never had a worry or a problem, just more RAM.  The computer in question is alive and well, and I subsequently replaced the HDD with an SSD, again without any troubles.\n", "Q: Activity Monitor showing significantly less memory than About This Mac I've noticed this has been asked many, many times in the past, but I think my question/problem might be slightly different.\nOver the last year I've found my Mac has slowed down to a point where it's virtually unusable to all but the simplest of tasks!\nSo, I did a fresh OS install on a new drive, which I'm running on now. Still the same problem!\nOn further investigation, I noticed this slowness is down to a memory problem (too much being allocated to the hard disk), and therefore the HD is working overtime to make up for a memory error.\nMy question is this; I have 5GB of memory under About This Mac/Memory, but only 1GB when profiling within Activity Monitor. Surely, this isn't correct? I know there is small discrepancies, but not this much. Surely there must be a memory error here, as in the computer is not using it's full quota of available memory. Instead, it's only using 1GB.\nPlease see the attached image, and notice the memory types and slot's I am using - \nIs there anything someone can help or spot here on the memory setup, or errors that would cause this either with hardware or software?\n\nA: I would remove the two smaller DIMMs and see if the Activity Monitor sees 4GB, as it looks as if the 2 2GB DIMMs are not being seen. If this is the case, then keep the 512MBs out and upgrade the RAM, which is very inexpensive these days.\nIf you're planning to keep this Mac Pro for a while, its worth loading up on RAM even if you don't think you need it, because future OS version may require it. I've always tried to match RAM sizes in all slots, and not mix sizes, and even further, matching the DIMM manufacturer. This may just be an unneeded caution, but you should find out the exact RAM requirements for this particular Mac Pro on the Apple support site.\n", "Q: Trying to find the /etc/resolve I'm trying to connect a Macbook Air running 10.8.4 to a Windows 2008 R2 server.

Try just opening the resolv.conf file which is a text file that contains a list of DNS servers.  It may be blank, in which case you can just add lines using the following format as an example:\nnameserver 172.16.1.254\nnameserver 172.16.2.254\n\nCheck this link for a bit more\n\nA: The way OS X handles .local domains changes frequently between versions of, and as @stuffe said, that's a very old link so its advice is pretty much irrelevant now. For 10.8.4, Apple recommends adding the .local domain to the DNS Search Domains list in Network preferences.\n(For versions OS X 10.6 and 10.7, see KB article #TS4041 instead.)\n", "Q: VirtualBox Ubuntu shared folder is empty I have a Ubuntu virtual machine (Virtual Box) hosted on my MBP w/ Mountain Lion.  OSX 10.8.6, VirtualBox 4.2.16, Ubuntu 12.4 LTS (32 bit)\nPROBLEM\nThe shared folder(s) as seen in Ubuntu is/are empty.\n\nDiary of searching for an answer on interwebs (No joy so far)\nShare folder in VirtualBox Host=Mac OS, Guest=Debian  - No joy. The answer is for manual mounting. Auto mounting explicitly puts/mounts the shared folder in /media directory. Besides I tried it and got \"no such file or directory\" - but then I may not be understanding exactly where I'm creating this; no terminal guru, I.\nNext ...\nSet the shared folder via VirtualBox | Devices | shared folders menu. The dialog box indicates \"full\" access and \"auto-mount\". Then launched the VM. The shared folder is created, but empty. BTW, the folders are created in /media directory per the VB documentation.\nAfter launching the VM, in Ubuntu, using VB | Devices menu, created a new shared folder. Restart Ubuntu, folder is created but empty.\nNext ...\nTried the above, creating \"machine folder\" and/or \"transient folder\" - same result as above.\nNext ...\nTried the above referencing folders on both drives on my MBP.

Now I can see the files in /mnt/MyShare/VirtualShare/\n\n\n*\n\n*the mounting :( does not survive a restart/reboot\n\n\nThis answer is bewildering because the VirtualBox documentation explicitly states that auto mounting is done in /media directory. And indeed, the shared folder is created - but its empty.\nFurther, I did/do not understand the significance of /mnt directory. That looked arbitrary to me, but apparently not. ../MyShare piece of it is; use any name you wish.\nNow if I could only delete all those folders I created during experimentation. And to think I used to be an absolute wiz on the CP/M command line! (that sure dates me!!)\n\nA: In my case, I have found a temporary way to bypass this. by using \nls -la \nI found out that the folder belongs to root instead of the user that was created when I provisioned the VM. Since trying to change the owner of the folder or its content did not work, I copied the folder to my home directory\nsudo cp -r foldername ~/foldername\nthen I was able to change the owner of the target folder and its content.\nchown -R myusername:myusername ~/foldername\n\nA: I had the same/similar problem with empty folders for shared folders (e.g. in /media/sf_my_folder_name)\nIt turned out that although I thought I has installed the guest additions, in fact the installation had failed. (check this by running lsmod | grep -i vbox - if the install worked you should get output referring to vboxsf, vboxguest & vboxvideo)\nTo install manually, I first ran 'insert guest additions CD image..' from the Devices menu to mount it, then from a terminal window ran \nsudo sh /media/build/VBOXADDITIONS_5.0.8_103449//VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nthen, check that your folder is mounted ( Settings/ Shared folders/ add ..) before rebooting.\nThe mounted, non-empty folder should then be in  /media/sf_your_folder_name\n", "Q: How does the Mac choose which connection to use when both Wifi and Ethernet are connected? When I'm connected to two networks with separate routers using Wifi and Ethernet, how does my Mac know what connection to use when I visit a website?\n\nA: It's in your Network Preferences. Here's screen shots from 10.7.3.\nAccess the settings from the gear at the bottom of the network type sidebar.   \n\nChoose \"Set Service Order...\" to drag them into the preferred order.\n\n\nA: The Service Order doesn't work.  If you test it, you will find that Mac OS prioritizes Wifi over Ethernet, even if Ethernet is set higher in the Service Order.\nOne way to test it is to measure your bandwidth (e.g., https://www.fast.com) in the following scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connected to Wifi, with Ethernet unplugged\n\n*Connected to Ethernet, with Wifi turned off\n\n*Connected to Wifi and Ethernet\n\n\nYou will find that the speed from #2 is faster than #1 and #3.  You will also find that #1 and #3 are the same speed.\nThe only solution is to disable WiFi when you connect via Ethernet and turn on Wifi when you disconnect Ethernet.\nThis script does that automatically!\nhttps://gist.github.com/albertbori/1798d88a93175b9da00b\nIf you have any issues, search the comments for the error message you encounter.  For example, I got the Path had bad ownership/permissions error, but the solution is posted in the comments.\n\nA: I recommand you to never use a configuration where you may have at the same\ntime different interfaces up on the same machine. You won't have any easy knowledge and control of this dual connectivity.\nThis may lead to huge difficulties to analyse even the simplest network trouble.\nThis may also cause loops within company or personnal networks very hard to diagnose.

I got more download speed than individual connections and in case of multiplayer games, I could connect to servers with less lag and latency. \n\nA: When my M1 iMac arrives, I will be connecting to my old 2013 27\" iMac which I'm keeping until a 32-bit program's conversion to 64-bit is beta.  I could use Wi-Fi or an ethernet cable (My old Mac has Thunderbolt-1).   And I plan on doing some data transferring with my wife's newer iMac with a Thunderbolt-3 cable, carrying my Mac into her Mac's room.\nI figure the Thunderbolt-3 is fastest, and Wi-Fi's slowest.\nI'm guessing that I should turn off Wi-Fi while I'm doing the transferring, and that's all I will need to do.   Is that correct?\n", "Q: How can I make it so that customers can download my app on their ios device without using the app store? I have already made a native iOS app and I was wondering if the consumers could just download the app onto their phone without jailbreaking or installing anything. I could maybe use a third party app store, but I can't have them download the store app and I need it to use my native app, not a web app. Is this even possible? My alternative is to make the app a web app and put it on a 3rd party web app store.\n\nA: Short answer: You can't.\nYou can't install native apps without Apple's App Store or a developer account's limited ability to distribute test software or an enterprise account's ability to distribute to it's registered devices.\nWeb apps are completely unrestricted, but have no means to \"install\". You have to instruct users to save the bookmark on their home screen. \n\nA: You can do this, and it's called Ad-Hoc development. It allows you to install on up to 100 devices, from the internet, but there's a catch. You have to get the UDID of every device that you want the app to install on and add it to your ad-hoc provisioning profile before the device will install the app. So, possible, but limited.\n\nA: There's no way to do this without the customer jailbreaking their device.\nYour only option is a web app.\n\nA: All iOS devices have built-in strong security mechanisms that will prevent any native app from being installed or run unless it is signed by Apple or by a developer certificate.  Developer signed apps check with Apple's servers and are limited to 100 devices max per developer account.\nSo the only way to distribute a native iOS app to over 100 consumers stock OS devices requires your app consumers to buy developer enrollments themselves, at $99/annum, which will make your app very expensive.  Or just submit it to Apple and see if they approve it for their store.\nWeb apps can be installed from any web site, with a custom icon even, and can be run offline, but are limited in performance and functionality.\n", "Q: Sync ratings bidirectional between iOS and iTunes on PC? Is it possible to synchronize library meta-data, specifically the star ratings, bidirectionally between iTunes on PC and iPad?\nI am rarely listening to music, but if I do so, it is likely on the iPad (mini) hence ratings will happen sometimes there but sometimes also on PC. In order to make that worthwhile however a synchronization from iPad to PC and PC to iPad is necessary. \nSo far I have only found threads were adventurous workarounds and many posts said, that synchronizing even ends up removing ratings from their mobile device. Is there really no possibility to get (preferably automatic) bidirectional synchronization of this data?\nAnother possibility mentioned was iTunes match, but since I don't use music too often, the annual fee seems too high.\nPS: I strongly prefer non-jailbreak solutions. \n\nA: You can turn off manual mode and use automatic syncing -- this will maintain the ratings both ways. In iTunes you want to be sure \"manually manage music and videos\" is not checked. \nMight need some tweaking if you don't sync your whole library though.  Best way I found to solve that complexity issue is using smart playlists...\n", "Q: How to get a complete list of all applications installed? Using OSX 10.8.4., I am having a hard time finding a complete list of all software applications installed on my Mac.

It's an example on my computer and maybe the result will be the same whatever the commande for you.\n\nA: Using plistbuddy you can get some information and parse through it for the things you need.\nThis will get all installed apps/utilities with their version numbers and put it in a text file for you.\n#!/bin/sh\n(\n    for i in /Applications/*.app\n     do\n         Printf \"$i \\t\" | cut -c15-1000\n      /usr/libexec/plistbuddy -c Print:CFBundleShortVersionString: \"$i\"/Contents/info.plist\n        done\n\n    for u in /Applications/Utilities/*.app\n     do\n         Printf \"$u \\t\" | cut -c25-1000\n      /usr/libexec/plistbuddy -c Print:CFBundleShortVersionString: \"$u\"/Contents/info.plist\n    done\n)   >${USER}Applist.txt\n\n\nA: I know the question has been asked 4 years ago, several answers have been given, each one tries to solve the problem differently (via GUI or CLI) but none of them is complete.\nYesterday in my company, every macOS user was asked to provide:\n\na list of all applications installed on their OS X / macOS systems for\n  a software audit\n\nTo make the process consistent, easy and complete, everyone ran the same command in terminal\nls -l /Applications | open -ef &&  ls -l /usr/local/bin | open -ef\n\nAbove command opens 2 files in a default text editor with a list of all installed apps as well as list of all “executables” which should also be considered as applications.\nI think that this provides the most comprehensive solution for a given problem. It’s quick and does the job. \nTo provide more detailed answer let’s finally go through all commands and arguments so that everything is clear to those who are scared with using terminal.\nThe ls command simply lists directory contents.

When an app calls for GPS data, does it activate the GPS call itself and then when another app simultaneously running calls it does it make a separate call? Or when the second app accesses the GPS does it get the data that's already there (or something similar, like a channel is opened in both apps which the GPS system sends all data to each channel when data is available)?\nI'm wondering, because if each app only gets control of the GPS half the time it could certainly result in a less effective GPS. So I'm guessing that the iPhone was built with this in mind and the same GPS data would be available to each app, but I don't know if that's what's being done. \nDoes anyone know the internal workings of GPS on iOS?\n\nA: In iOS, Location Services sits between all the location radios (cellular tower info, nearest wifi, GPS) and the apps, and caches the fused results between getting new information from those radios at a rate determined by the OS for decent battery life versus requested accuracy.  Apps never \"control\" or talk to the GPS hardware or OS driver directly.  The location information an app gets is time-stamped, so an app can check to see if it's old info or not.\n\nA: I'll preface this with, I'm not an IOS developer, but I'm sure it works much the same was as Android and other GPS APIs.\nWhen an App calls the GPS APIs it's calling an abstraction to the GPS/Location system and receives position information that the system presents.\nSo in this case when one application asks the OS for Location data, the OS uses a mix of GPS and Wifi data to determine the location of the device. If at the same time another application requests location data, the phone would just use the location data that it has instead of having to turn on the radios again.\n", "Q: What alternatives for reporting OSX Server Web Stats do the same job as AWStats?

But the problem is that when i turn on the video via Apple TV I have double sound from the sound - from the TV set connected via HDMI and the sound system connected via TOSLINK. The later is deleyed due to the fact that TOSLINK is coverted RCA.  This makes me turn off sound in the TV set.\nIs there a way to not transmit sound via HDMI in Apple TV if it is anyway transmited to TOSLINK?\n\nA: You could always use an HDMI cable that doesn't carry sound, not too expensive these days.\n\nA: No, there is no way to disable HDMI sound output on Apple TV. The only solution is to mute sound on the TV itself, so you only hear audio from the receiver (sound system).\n\nA: not sure about your TV but mine has a setting to turn the speakers off on the TV.

Since the update I'm not able to open in Applications Cienega.  I'm receiving a error message that says  I have Mac OS X 10.6.8. The application requires Mac OS X 10.7 or later.  How do I upgrade?\n\nA: Apple has started selling OS X Lion redemption codes,  for £14 (in the UK) so you can still buy the old OS if you need to.\nSee also: Is It Possible to Still Upgrade to OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.\n\nA: Mac OS X Lion (10.7) was removed from the Mac App Store with the release of Mountain Lion in the summer of 2012. Therefore, your only legit option for purchasing a copy would be to look for someone selling a new USB version of the OS (instead of releasing Lion on a DVD, as they had with previous updates, Apple released it on a small USB flash drive). You can try eBay, they seem to have a few up for grabs. You could find somewhere else to download it, or find a friend who has the USB version and borrow it from them, but that would be illegitimate.\n\nA: Go to the App Store and find OS X Mountain Lion over there.

I've got a Sandisk SSD as my boot drive in my Super Bay and a 1.5TB hard disk in my HD bay. (I realize I could get better SSD performance if I swapped those, but the HD is too tall.)\nWhen I boot my computer, everything seems fine. But after varying amounts of usage time, the SSD goes unwritable until I reboot. It's extremely weird. I can't touch to create new files anywhere (I get an error message like \"touch: test.txt: Invalid argument\"), I can't save anything, and applications like Mail, which depend on disk access start crashing without error messages. The Console and logs don't seem to be revealing anything unusual. Disk Utility doesn't start and diskutil hangs. If I manage to run out my main memory, I get the \"Boot disk is full, kill an application\" message. But even more weirdly, for apps that don't need to save anything, the computer seems to work fine. Rebooting restores everything to normal temporarily.\nI'm not sure if it's related, but I also have these sporadic periods of 10-20 seconds of spinning rainbow ball, where kernel_task is my highest CPU user and seems to block ALL other activity. Disk transfers, network transfers, and all else seem to come to a temporary halt until whatever it is its doing finishes. I can usually still Cmd+Tab to Activity Monitor during these seizures.\nI brought it to the Apple Store today, and their diagnostics couldn't find anything unsually. They successfully repaired permissions in Safe Mode, but the problem still exists. The tech there said that it seems as though the kernel can continue writing to disk in this state, but nothing in user mode.\nAnybody have any idea whatsoever what might be causing this? My only other option will be to reinstall the OS, but I'm trying to make that my last resort.\n\nA: It is possible that you are using a disk driver such as fuse. If so, uninstall it. \nI also have a 2010 MacBookPro with an SSD in my optical bay and a 750 gig drive. I found myself in a similar situation; unable to boot because my data drive randomly became read only at reboot.  \nThe culprit was fuse. It decided to remove my mount point, and create a symbolic link in its place. \nTry booting into safe mode by holding down the shift key, and removing any fuse like programs. \nCheck /Volumes for any symbolic links (Except for the symbolic link to / )\nIf the issue persists, try creating a new user account. \nLastly, because both sata ports are sata 2, it is unlikely you would see any performance increase by swapping drive locations. \n", "Q: Clean restart from terminal? In the last several weeks, my OS X 10.8.4 laptop has gotten completely stuck in states where it's impossible to interact with directly. Several times VMWare Fusion's USB shim has broken keyboard input. One time, the system had an apparent race condition between locking the system and drawing the unlock prompt, leaving the GUI completely wedged. These are terrible problems, but there's nothing I can do to fix them.\nAll I can do is figure out how I can get a clean restart when this happens. I can ssh in to the computer and run any commands, without problem. I don't really trust the system state to be recoverable in either of those states, so I just want a clean reboot.\nBut shutdown -h now is not a clean reboot. It doesn't do the same things for cleanly shutting down GUI apps that selecting \"Restart...\" or \"Shutdown...\" from the apple menu does. It results in data loss because GUI apps weren't shut down cleanly. I could try finding everything I have running in ps, and sending them all SIGTERM. It seems to work, but it's a hugely manual process. I'd love to just tell OS X to do whatever it does when you pick those menu items.\nSo - is there a utility that does this right? Am I stuck doing it in a manual and error-prone way?\n\nA: Yeah, ok.  I can solve this with Applescript.  Thanks to patrix for getting me to look in the right direction.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    restart\nend tell\n\nSaved as restart.scpt, run with osascript restart.scpt.

I'm curious as to what build flags are available to me when installing gcc 4.8 using brew.\nThis question explains how to install gcc 4.8 using brew, but only specifies two possible flags i.e (--enable-cxx and --enable-fortran). \nIs there a list of what's available or can someone iterate them for me?\nIf it matters I am running OS X 10.7.5 on the Intel i5 dual core.\n\nA: Use brew options.

With brew options [formula] you can list the build flags you can use directly with brew install. These options are defined in the Formula of the software and you can inspect it with brew edit [formula] (e.g. brew edit gcc48 and search for option lines).\nHowever, at least with gcc (and any software that uses Autoconf), you can list all possible flags by following the steps below.\nFirst, use brew install -i gcc48 to get a shell with the package to be installed extracted to a temporary directory. From there, you can use ./configure --help to list all possible flags for the particular software.\nIf you want to use some of the flags not possible with brew, you can proceed as you would with a normal installation without brew (./configure [flags]; make; make install). After that, when you exit, brew should pick up the finished build and you are done.\nIf you just exit after taking a look at the ./configure --help, brew notices that the there is nothing to be installed and exits with an error (\"Error: Empty installation\"). The same happens when there is some error in the actual build process (\"Aborting due to non-zero exit status\").\n", "Q: Two Monitors Setup On a MacBook Pro I want to setup a two-monitor environment for me and my MBP15 Late 2011.

I'm not getting a clear answer out of Google and would like to know if I'm going to have to reinstall my Mac operating system when attempting to get Bootcamp going on the system.\nThank you.\n\nA: Boot Camp creates a separate partition on your hard drive through \"non-destructive partitioning\", that is, by taking a chunk out of the free space left on your hard drive. You should always make a backup first, just in case, but the expected result is that you will simply end up with two partitions instead of one on your hard drive. One will be for Boot Camp, and the other will be for Mac OS X and all of your existing files/applications/etc.\nSee this Apple support document. Also when you start Boot Camp Assistant it will present a guide that you can print out to follow along with while setting it up.\n\nA: No, you don't.

If done correctly, and assuming a firmware password is not set, you should see your internal hard drive show up on the display.  This is just to verify what you should see.\n\n*Now, power on your Mac while holding the option + control keys.  Do you see the same screen that you did when you only held option?  If so then your physical control key (really the whole keyboard) is faulty.  The logical next step would be to replace the keyboard.  If not, your Mac booted normally without showing you the screen in the first step, then your control key is working properly.  Since option + control is not an actual modifier when booting it is ignored and the process continues normally, this would tell us that both keys are functional and recognized at the hardware level.  At this point you could try repairing or reinstalling your operating system.\nHope that helps narrow it down for you.\n", "Q: Duplicate archive subfolders with Mail.app I have a strange problem with Mail and I cannot understand if it's a bug or not.\nWhen I archive a message, Mail creates duplicated subfolders.

I would like to be able to go into Finder and open files into an existing instance of Sublime Text 2, which has a side menu with all open files.  However, when I hit Open With -> Sublime Text 2.app, it opens a whole new instance of Sublime, which is not what I want.  I can certainly accomplish grouping of my documents in a single instance if I open them within the application but that requires more steps and time, i.e. is not always  as convenient as opening them from Finder.\n\nA: As shown in this answer on SuperUser, you can set this behaviour by changing the open_files_in_new_window setting in Sublime Text to false. (Note that it's recommended that you override the setting in the Settings - User file rather than changing it in Settings - Default.)\n", "Q: Will VOX music player change anything in my iTunes library?

(Or makes the volume down when one of the device turn on alongside other).\nFor Example: \nWhile you watching TV on TV alone, when you turn on the Apple TV the volume goes down, when you turn off the Apple TV it again goes up to the original level.\nCould you explain me why it happens ? And how can I make it work without the volume going up and down?\nI thought of ARC system where I will get rid of the TOSLINK cable, and plug the the HDMI directly to the Amplifier, although my Amplifier doesn't support ARC , and I doubt that there are connectors that make it possible to be compatible with ARC and have RCA output.\nThank you very much for your time and help.\n\nA: It is dropping in level because the end of an audio connection usually has a termination point. and/or the signal is being routed to electronics that are adding slight resistances to the signal.  (in simple terms there is a cap on the end :-)\nThe least solution, would be to use an isolation transformer to one of the connection point, then one of the Yed signals could be isolated from the other device.\nThe most solution would be to use an audio distribution amp. Or to  route through a device that would passthrough the audio (unterminated) Like some amps or pre-amps. or to use other devices (like a equaliser) that would have 2 seperated outputs.\n\nA: If I'm understanding correctly, you're using \"2RCA to 1RCA\" splitters to combine your two signals into a single input for your amplifier.\nTypically you would use a mixer for this purpose, rather than simply connecting the wires together. You could get a cheap mixer (e.g. from eBay) that supports 2x Stereo inputs (technically that's 4 channels) to a stereo output, and use that instead of the 2-to-1 RCA splitters. Mixers often use the larger headphone jack (1/4\" or 6.35mm), so you may need adaptors from RCA as well.\nThe other option is to have a switcher, rather than mixer, if you only actually want one of the signals at any given time. These are considerably cheaper, but require you to manually change them (which you're perhaps trying to avoid?). These are often 3-channel (they include video), but can still be used to switch between multiple audio sources.\nAlso worth checking if your amplifier has multiple inputs that you could use; some have basic switching or mixing capabilities inbuilt.\n", "Q: How can I right click on an image in Finder and copy its pixel data?

In Windows it is possible to permanently delete a file or folder from the right click contextual menu. The right click contextual menu in OS X, does not by default give the option to delete a file or folder in this way, only the option to \"Move to Trash\", which means you then have to empty the trash manually in order to delete the file or folder.\nIs it therefore possible to add this option to the contextual menu, to aid quick deletion ?\n\nA: There is a service called Delete Immediately\n(through https://superuser.com/questions/10676/permanently-deleting-files-on-mac-os)\nor you can make your own with Automator by means of the rm shell command.\nCheck also here. \n\nA: I'm surprised it's not mentioned here, but there is a keyboard shortcut for this already.\nIt's option-command-delete.\nThis works on El Capitan.  I'm not sure which version of OS X it was added in.\n\nThis shortcut works from anywhere in Finder (which is what this question is about), and also from inside the Trash (which is where I got the answer).\n\nA: The simplest way is to create your own Service and call it whatever you want to name it.\nI created a service simply called Delete Now and put it in my context menu like I have done here:\n\nMake Your Own Delete Service\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up Automator (/Applications/Utilities/Automator) and create a new Service\n  \n\n*At the top right pane, select files or folders in Finder\n  \n\n*On the left most pane, select Utilities and drag the Run Shell Script option to the workflow\n  \n\n*Change the \"Pass input\" field to arguments\n  \n\n*Pase the following into the shell script body  \n\n\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\nrm -rf \"$f\"\ndone\nafplay \"/System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds/finder/empty trash.aif\"  \n\n6.

Every time you \"delete\" something you are actually moving it to the recycle folder. There are only a few circumstances when a folder will not be sent to the recycle bin they are as follows.\n1 When you close out of something without saving and it hasn't been autosaved or saved before. \n2 If you cut an item then cut another item therefore over riding the cache.\n3 If the folder is a temporary file.\nThe nice thing about windows though is that you can let the recycle bin build up without looking at an icon of a whole bunch of trash.

I tried using AppleScript records to give you a solution. In the code below, I was unable to use a string as a key.  I did manage to use something that resembles a file name, an identifier, but this isn't really working.

What I tried to do is to define records of records.\nI think that the main thing to keep in mind about the strengths and weaknesses of AppleScript is that is a language designed for Interapplication Communication (IAC), revolving a round the \"tell command\" to tell different apps to get data, set data, and to control the apps by telling them commands.\nHere is a link to an answer that I believe is relevant to an AppleScript solution for you:\nFinding the Intersection of Two Lists\nThe ultimate solution using AppleScript would be to use AppleScriptObjC which would allow you to use Objective-C classes such as NSDictionary that are very much like associative arrays.  \n\nA: If you can use a shell script (or do shell script), awk supports associative arrays with string keys and fast lookup.\n$ cat widths.txt\n2.tif 600\n1.tif 500\n4.tif 700\n$ cat heights.txt\n4.tif 1000\n2.tif 900\n$ awk 'NR==FNR{a[$1]=$2;next}{print $1\" \"a[$1]/$2}' widths.txt heights.txt\n2.tif 0.666667\n4.tif 0.7\n\n\nA: Actually, it IS possible for your first script to write a second script and run the second script 'inside the other' thus allowing you to write keys 'on-the-fly'.

Voila!\nTested and working on both Mountain Lion and Mavericks with two U2713H monitors.\n\nA: Horray! I found a solution.\nI bought the Apple Mini DisplayPort to DVI converter cable adapter instead of using HDMI, and my picture is much more crisp and clear.\n\nMy Retina display is still better, but it's a better screen. my HP monitor is now performing to is ability.  For some reason, HDMI must degrade the video quality.\n\nA: Are you using the \"Best Resolution for display\" setting for the external monitor?  I was forcing 1920x1080 and seeing a similar fuzzy look.  I changed from the fixed resolution to Best Resolution (even tough they are the same), and my fonts are now smooth on my Viewsonic (at work) and my HP (at home) 24\" monitors.\n\nA: Have you tried toggling Use LCD Font Smoothing off and rebooting? To my eyes, it makes fonts on non-Retina displays look super thick and somewhat blurry, not unlike your photos.

It was the different way which Windows and OSX render their fonts (aliasing). Some people prefer Windows's sharp font, others prefer OSX style.\nI hope I understood your problem correctly because what you showed in the image(not clear, not a screen capture but from a camera) was what I have noticed before.\nSee here for a comparison on the two algorithms for aliasing fonts.\n", "Q: How to reduce MacBook Air 2013 1.7GHz CPU power consumption?

Plug it in and back up your HD using Time Machine. Optionally image it using Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper (two I am familiar with, there are others.\nOnce the backup is complete following the above procedure will wipe the drive and install a fresh OS on it.\nYou can use the Tools (?) menu in the installer to launch Disk Utility and wipe the hard drive, even write it with zeros without dealing with Linux utilities. But really if you just reformat the drive in Disk Utility and reinstall the OS MOST people won't know how to get any meaningful data off the drive. And besides installing a fresh OS will overwrite a lot of the old data anyway.\nWhen I sell and old Mac I just reformat in Disk Utility and reinstall the OS... YMMV\n\nA: If you have 10.7 or later, you can erase and reinstall OS X from the recovery partition. See http://support.apple.com/kb/PH4439.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold command-R on startup.\n\n*Open Disk Utility and erase the main OS X partition (like Macintosh HD, indented below a drive) or other partitions you have added.\n\n*Choose Reinstall OS X.\n\n\nIf you erase the whole drive in the second step, the hidden recovery and EFI partitions are also erased. If the Mac supports Internet Recovery mode, it can download an image of the recovery system from Apple's servers, and you can reinstall OS X normally after that.\nIf you are selling the Mac, consider erasing the data securely so that it cannot be recovered with an application like DiskWarrior or Data Rescue. If you have an HDD, you can erase data on it securely by choosing the single pass option from the Security Options sheet in Disk Utility:\n\nIf you have an SSD, see this question.\n", "Q: How can I speed up iMovie? iMovie is basically unusable for me at this point. I've got over 1000 video clips (most of them around 6 seconds since they were taken in Vine) and any time I try and switch events or projects it takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes (I've timed it).\nI'm frustrated enough at this point to drop the $300 on Final Cut Pro X if that's what it takes to actually be able to do anything with my video files. Anyone know if this will actually address the issue? Is Final Cut Pro X going to be able to handle this amount of video files better than iMovie? I really don't want to spend the money and then have the same problems...\nI have a Mac Mini purchased in 2011. 8G RAM. 750GM 7,200RPM HD.\n\nA: I think I've fixed my problem. I had 1000+ movies in iPhoto, and since iMovie just treats them as 1 huge \"event\" it was trying to open an event with 1000+ movies in it. My HD only had ~10GB empty. I exported them all out of iPhoto, moved them to an external HD, separated them out into individual folders and imported each folder 1 by 1 as a separate event, keeping the files stored on my external HD. I've now got my 3 years of video files all imported and have created 3 different projects which I've taken to completion and posted to Youtube. iMovie is lithe and snappy once again!\nSo, tips for speeding up iMovie:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free up HD space so you have >10~15% free\n\n*Make sure your events don't have too many video files in them (anything over 50 is getting close to the upper limit it seems)\n\n*Consider an external HD, preferably SSD (You can use multiple drives to hold your \"events\". You're not just limited to your primary HD)\n\n", "Q: iPhone and iTunes Match I have a quite large library of songs and I do like the majority of them on my iPhone (main reason I purchased the 64Gb version).\nProblem is that we have very slow internet here and turning on iTunes Match on my phone and telling it to download all songs in my main play list can take days up to weeks to complete.\nI would turn iTunes Match off just on my phone but I like to see my entire library and download a single new song when I add one to my pc. Is there a way I can do an old fashioned sync of 1 playlist and then turn iTunes Match on without the phone first deleting all the previous wired synced songs?\nJust to save redownloading them all from iCloud really.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: Turn off iTunes Match on the iPhone and synch your playlists/songs via iTunes. After synchronisation turn iTunes Match back on. You will receive a warning message, but your synchroniszed songs will stay on the phone (you can easily verify that by checking the cloud icon, which should not be there).\nThe only important thing is, that the songs you've synchronize must be part of your iTunes Match library. Else they will vansih after re-enabling iTunes Match.\nFor me that works perfectly fine.\n", "Q: replace i5 with i7 cpu in mid2012 MBP is it possible to change my i5 iwy bridge CPU with an i7 one in my mid 2012 mbp?\nMy mbp is a non retina model.\n\nA: No. The CPU is welded on the motherboard.

I have an iPad 2 running iOS 5.1.1 and it is jailbroken (though as far as I know, not running SSH). A few hours ago I set a new 4-digit device passcode which I subsequently forgot. I've tried a few times now and it blocked me out for a full hour twice now, I suspect if I try again it will completely block the device.\nI last made an iTunes backup and synchronisation about 3-4 months ago on a laptop that I still have, but is currently unusable (the HDD is in another country, I won't be able to use that laptop for at least 2 more weeks).\nI have other computers with iTunes, when I connect my iPad to this other machines I get a message telling me that I have to unlock it first before iTunes will connect to it, which means that I cannot browse the filesystem using iExplorer or iFunBox (then I would be able to delete the keychain file and get in that way... I hope). I think that if I connect my iPad to my original laptop (2 weeks away) that I'll be able to get-in without needing the passcode? Is this true?\nI found out about the Gecko iPhone Toolkit, however that only works up to iPhone 4 (A4) whereas the iPad 2 is an A5-powered device. I also couldn't find any download links, oddly enough.\nI read about a Ramdisk that I could boot from in Recovery Mode that has an SSH server, but the steps looked too complicated and the forum posts don't mention the iPad 2 and iOS 5 which made me wonder if it would work or not, I didn't want to risk it.\nI see that commercial forensics tools like Elcomsoft's iOS Toolkit and Cellebrite UFED claim to be able to get into my device, but if they can do it how come the jailbreakers can't?\nCoincidentally, I contacted a local data recovery company and they left me a voicemail just now saying that they wouldn't be able to recover data from an iPad 2, only a first-generation iPad, which is a bummer - but I don't know what tool they use.\nI'll try contacting other data recovery companies in the meanwhile, but is my situation really helpless?\nUpdate:\nI tried another passcode attempt and that caused my iPad to be disabled. Ho-hum. I returned home today and plugged my iPad into my laptop and while iTunes did not offer to remove the passcode I was able to access the raw filesystem using iFunBox, which I could not do when my iPad was connected to any of my other computers.\nI deleted the keychain-2.db and com.apple.springboard.plist files and rebooted my device, however the passcode prompt still persists.\nI'm not too bothered about the passcode on the device preventing me from logging-in because iFunBox gives me the raw filesystema access so I can grab the files and data I need (such as my iMessages database) and wipe the device at a later date if I can't get the passcode back.\nStill, if anyone knows why deleting keychain-2.db didn't work, please let me know.\n\nA: The canonical way to fix this is to erase and restore the device.\nSee http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1212 for more details and options.\n\nA: Here is a way to get into your iPad without losing any data. \nOpen iTunes on your computer. Disable your iPad and press and hold the lock button until slide to power off appears. Click Cancel. iPad is disabled should disapear. Plug into iTunes. Back up and then restore. Restore from the backup you made. TADA! No passcode. Wait until it finishes its sync with iTunes before disconecting. Redownload the stuff from other computers that you put on. You will have to re-jailbreak your iPad.\n\nA: Computers that have been synced with iTunes do not need to enter a password the next time they connect to the iPad. But unfortunately, due to technical limitations of iOS devices, there is currently no iOS unlocking tool that can unlock iPad without deleting data. Whether you use dr.fone, FoneCope or any other tool. If you don't have iCloud backups or other available backups, this can be a disaster. If you can, you'd better get your original computer as soon as possible. Otherwise you can only recover the forgotten iPad 2 4-digit passcode by sacrificing the data.\n", "Q: Dates in my iPhoto library are wrong Since some time the dates in my iPhoto library have all changed to the day my library was created. The pictures still appear chronologically in the events screen but they all show the creation date (of the library not the picture) under the event. If I try to change the date and time I can only change the time of the picture the date is fixed on January 5th, 2013.\n\nA: Try using Repair Disk Permissions for the hard drive where your iPhoto library is. You can do this from the Disk Utility app.\nThis might (or might not) solve your problem about not being able to change the date of your current pictures. It will probably won't restore your original dates.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Terminal: -bash: $: command not found While trying to install pagekite on OS X Snow Leopard using the following command:\n$ pagekite.py --signup\n\nI got:\n-bash: $: command not found\n\nI am a noob with the terminal but after reading a bit I understand that it is a problem with my PATH\necho $PATH\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/X11/bin\n\nCan anybody spot the problem? If you ask me -without knowing a thing about it- I suspect the MacGPG2 (MacGnuPrivcacyGuard2) is out of place? \nThanks for your time!\n\nA: Your PATH looks fine. The PATH variable is a collection of folders/directories in which the shell looks for commands to execute. So if you install additional software like MacGPG there might get new parts added.\nBut I assume that the command you are calling is called pagekite.py and not actually $. So you should call it like\npagekite.py --signup\n\nor (if it is in your current folder/directory)\n./pagekite.py --signup\n\nThe $ is often used in documentation to represent the shell command prompt and should not be entered to run the command afterwards.\n", "Q: How to get overview of keyboard shortcuts from OS X?

Then just start a new terminal session to load the new variable. \nAnother way to do this: \n  cd /usr/bin\n  rm cc gcc c++ g++\n  ln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.8 cc\n  ln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.8 gcc\n  ln -s /usr/local/bin/c++-4.8 c++\n  ln -s /usr/local/bin/g++-4.8 g++\n\n\nA: Thanks to you all for your help. I ended up just creating aliases within ~/.bash_profile as follows:\nalias gcc='gcc-4.8'\nalias cc='gcc-4.8'\nalias g++='g++-4.8'\nalias c++='c++-4.8'\n\nThe answer from Lynken is very helpful, but I adapted it with aliases since that's easier for me to undo if necessary. \nSpecifically, if PATH is set such that /usr/local/bin (where brew puts the link to gcc 4.8) appears before appears /usr/bin (where gcc is linked by default), then creating links as Lyken suggested within /usr/local/bin should theoretically work for me. In practice, it doesn't for some reason -- failing with a linker error and aliases work around that error without me needing to solve that issue, too.\nThe other benefit of aliases is that I'm not having to link which I want homebrew to handle and not have to compete with that tool for which version of gcc is linked in /usr/local\n\nA: Let's assume your actual shell initialization is done through ~/.profile, then you will have to modify it so as to put /usr/local/bin ahead of any other PATH component where gcc and all its associated binary are.\nHere is the way to perform this clean modification:\n\ncd\n\n_shell_init=`egrep '(^| )PATH' .profile 2>/dev/null`\n\nif [ \"${_shell_init}\" = \"\" ] ; then\n    # PATH isn't defined in .profile\n    # install there the first relative definition of PATH\n    echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH}\nexport PATH' >>.profile\n    . .profile\n    exec ${SHELL}\nelse\n    # remove all occurences of /usr/local/bin wherever they might be\n    # set into PATH, and insert it ahead of all other components\n    sed -E -e '/(^| )PATH=/s,:/usr/local/bin,,' \\\n        -e '/(^| )PATH=/s,/usr/local/bin:,,' \\\n        -e '/(^| )PATH=/s,,&/usr/local/bin:,' .profile >.profile.new\n    mv .profile.new .profile\n    . .profile\n    exec ${SHELL}\nfi\n\nBeware: if your ~/.profile is already structured, this shell script will have to be manually tuned to fit correct PATH definition\nin the right place.\n\nA: I use to gcc-4.8:\nexport CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc\n\nexport CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++\n\nexport CPP=/usr/local/bin/cpp\n\nexport LD=/usr/local/bin/gcc\n\nalias c++=/usr/local/bin/c++\n\nalias g++=/usr/local/bin/g++\n\nalias gcc=/usr/local/bin/gcc\n\nalias cpp=/usr/local/bin/cpp\n\nalias ld=/usr/local/bin/gcc\n\nalias cc=/usr/local/bin/gcc\n\nand back to apple gcc:\nexport CC=/usr/bin/gcc\n\nexport CXX=/usr/bin/g++\n\nexport CPP=/usr/bin/cpp\n\nexport LD=/usr/bin/ld\n\nalias c++=/usr/bin/c++\n\nalias g++=/usr/bin/g++\n\nalias gcc=/usr/bin/gcc\n\nalias cpp=/usr/bin/cpp\n\nalias cc=/usr/bin/gcc\n\nalias ld=/usr/bin/ld\n\nor put it in file and then: source <file>\n\nA: On Mac M1, if you use brew install gcc, gcc will be installed on \"/opt/homebrew/bin/\".\nI am facing the same issue.

I would like when my car is started (and my 2nd SIM activates), my iPhone's cellular network would be automatically switched off (no radiation in the car anymore). My bluetooth should still stay on (need that to have my contacts synced with my car).\nMy current day-to-day procedure is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*when starting the car: manually put the iphone in airplane mode, and then manually switch on bluetooth again (with was also deactivated due to airplane mode).\n\n*when stopping the car: put manually airplane mode off, and make one outgoing call (e.g. voicemail) to activate my 1st dual-sim card again (otherwise my iPhone does not receive calls i noticed).\n\n\nIs there is a way to automate this? Or can I configure a kind of iPhone profile which activates/deactivates airplane mode & bluetooth (to have less manual actions).\n\nA: On a jailbroken iPhone, with SBProfiles and SBSettings you can utilise profiles to group multiple actions to different situations. The downside is that you have to manually switch the profiles when entering and leaving the car.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have SBProfiles and SBSettings installed from Cydia.\n\n*Open SBProfiles. It should have multiple profiles by default; Default and Car among them. Select Car and then Toggles. Drag Airplane and Bluetooth to On section. Make sure that Airplane is on top of Bluetooth, otherwise activation of Airplane will turn Bluetooth back off.\n\n*Then, go back to Car and select Done from the top bar. Select Default and then Toggles. Drag Airplane to Off section (and Bluetooth, if you don't need it outside the car).\n\n*Select Settings from the bottom tabs. Select Activation Method(s) under Profile Switching. Here you can select the action(s) that trigger the profile selection to become active. I think it defaults to Short Hold of the Sleep Button.\nNow, when you hold the Sleep Button a bit longer than shutting down the screen but not long enough to power off the iPhone, you can select Car profile and have cellular turned on but Bluetooth on. Or select Default to turn cellular back on. I think you will have to make the call still, unless there's a way to automate it, too.\n", "Q: How to know what percent of document that I read in Safari?

I have also not effectively tried this.\nBut I am pretty confident it will only delete the old backups for the computer currently being backed up, and will leave the other ones alone. If a Time Machine backup drive has extraneous files, Time Machine will leave them as is even when the disk is full.

When I reopen OSX Preview highlight works as it is supposed to (normal hight on highlights). Note: If I however save the PDF with a faulty highlight, the faulty highlight will still be there when I reopen the PDF – new highlight will work fine, but old ones are not corrected by saving and restarting OSX Preview.\n\nA: I am pretty sure it is related to the actual PDF and not Preview itself, because my highlighter works fine on other documents. It's something to do with how the line spacing is set up probably, but maybe Apple could make a way to adjust that?\n\nA: I have the same problem. It seems to occur only with PDFs that I have OCR'd with Adobe Acrobat. The same problem doesn't occur when highlighting the same file in other PDF readers, such as Skim. Quitting and restarting Preview does not help, in my case. Presumably, it's a Preview bug. I hope Apple fixes it.\n\nA: I have managed to fix the problem by using Preview to export the PDF file as a PDF.

Here are my stats and brief summary of the problem: \nmacbook pro; mid 2009; 13 inch; 2.26 GHz; 4GB RAM (currently, will elaborate); 10.7.5\nThe issue I'm having is that the computer constantly gets the BBOD (spinning Beach Ball Of Death) when performing everyday tasks. The BBOD will not resolve, even if I leave it over a few hours, so I eventually need to restart the computer. This can happen frequently, ranging from a few times in an hour to once a day. \nI have kept a detailed log of each freeze (time, what I was doing, general state of the system) and do not notice any triggers. As of late I have been getting error reports in the console associated with a few BBOD episodes. This may help diagnose the issue, though I don't know how to dissect the error reports very well. The only thing I can discern is that the Exception Type is SIGBUS which I've heard is usually RAM associated. An error report is attached at the end. \nWhat I have done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-install OSX (not much change)\n\n*Run memtest (RAM passed)\n\n*Exchange RAM/test sockets by leaving one module in and observing behavior (bank 1 seems to act up more than bank 0, but the freezing still occurs regardless of which bank a lone module is in.

Not widely known but KeyChain has its own First Aid utility which can be used to Verify or Repair the keychain files.\nJust invoke from the Keychain menu:\n\n\nWorth checking?\n\nA: My interpretation (which could well be wrong) of that error report is:\n\n\n*\n\n*the crsud process, which apparently is to do with security (code signing, software update and trust evaluation: see this discussion), has crashed.\n\n*it did so whilst it was running code related to the keychain (under \"Thread 0 Crashed\", start at the last entry (33) and read upwards, to see the different routines that are called): I noticed Security::KeychainCore::CCallbackMgr...\n\n*the type of error was EXC_BAD_ACCESS, which is a failure when accessing memory.\n\n*the area of memory it was trying to access was actually a file mapped into memory, and the file(s) were /private/var/db/*.\nSo actually, I'd be suspicious of your hard disk, rather than the RAM, and particularly files under /private/var/db and any related to the Keychain.  I would try Repair Disk in Disk Utility as a first step.  (You will need to boot from another location to do this.)\nSorry this isn't a complete answer (and bear in mind some of this is guesswork), but perhaps it provides another direction for things to try?\n\nA: From your original question there isn't enough strong evidence this is an hardwrae or software problem.\nHardware problem?\nTo eliminate most of the hardware origins, please run:\n   Apple Hardware Test\nbefore attempting any other tinkering with the system.\nRun it in extended mode and for at least 4 consecutive passes.\nOnce this 1st cause of trouble eliminated, please \nread the answer from Ashley and run Disk Utility from another disk\nthan your system one.\nMost probably your internal filesystem is in bad state since you regularly crash your system. Hence at every new boot the journal (of the filesystem) has to be used again to rebuild everything, and long processes killed have to start again their tasks.\nOnce this 2nd major cause of trouble eliminated, you will conclude that\nyou most probably have a software problem, and it might be time to locate it.\nSoftware problem\nFor this you will have to create a test account and use it for a serious amout of time, and with all the applications. Do you experience the same hangs with this test account?\nIf yes, then you have a general MacOS X misbehaviour.\nIn this case, you have to reinstall MacOX X Lion.\nIf not, you will have to locate which application within your environment is causing this misbehaviour.\nActivity Monitor will help you to identify what is going on when MacOS X stop being responsive. Until you will find the culprit, you will have to always run with this kernel spy on screen.\nAnother tool might be faster to identify the culprit processus. Open a Terminal or xterm window and type the following command:\ntop -o cpu\n\nthe top lines continuously refreshed by this command will show you if something abnormal is happening at the level of virtual memory or CPU usage, within seconds of the original problem.\n\nA: How to diagnose the SWoD from the command line\nThere are some very helpful tools included with OS X that I have used to diagnose this issue in the past.  They are all command line utilities, as usually the Spinning Wheel of Death will leave you without a working graphical interface with your computer.  If you are able to launch Terminal.app, you may be able to run them this way.  However, I've found that in some more extreme cases of lockup that my Macbook's display is just black and all I can see is the SWoD.  In this case, it is very helpful to have SSH remote access enabled for the machine.  You may follow this tutorial to enable SSH.\nFinding your Macbook on the network\nIf you are having a hard time finding your Macbook on the network, you can use dns-sd to find it:\n# List hosts advertising SSH via Avahi / DNS Service Discovery\n# -B for human-readable format\ndns-sd -B _ssh._tcp.\n# -Z for Zone File format\n# More helpful because it shows the FQDN.. i.e.: `mymacbook.local.`\ndns-sd -Z _ssh._tcp.\n\nSystem Stats Command Line Utilities\nThe following utilities can shed some light on the processes that may be using too many system resources and causing the lockup.  Read the manpage for more detail on each.\n\n*\n\n*htop - Available via Homebrew: brew install htop.  Like top, but with color UI and more sorting options such as Process Parent/Child Tree view.Run with: htop\n\n*iotop - Installed in OS X.  Helpful to find processes using lots of Disk I/O:sudo iotop 1\n\n*top - Installed in OS X.  Shows top processes sorted by a key of your choice.  For example, to sort by cpu: top -o cpu\n\n*systemstats - Installed in OS X.  Shows a wealth of useful system statistics such as:Battery usage, CPU stats, Thermal, Fan, Memory & I/O summaries, Ranked I/O Activity, Apps & Daemons ranked by CPU & Energy Impact, Interrupts / Idle Wakeups, Process Launches (incl. XPC svcs. & fork()), Devices connected, etc...Run it with: sudo /usr/sbin/systemstats\n\n*vm_stat - Installed with OS X.  Shows Mach kernel Virtual Memory statistics (how much disk space you're using for \"VRAM\").Run it with: /usr/bin/vm_stat\n\n*netstat - Installed with OS X. Show network connection status: netstat\n\n*nettop - Installed with OS X. Shows a top-style live updating list of processes using network I/O.  Helps if you have a very wide terminal.Run with: nettop\n\n*kextstat - List all inserted Mach Kernel Extensions (like Linux kernel modules). If you suspect a Kernel Extension or I/O Kit driver is causing the problem, you may unload the offending kernel module by finding its' bundle name with kextstat, then running kextunload:sudo kextunload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB\n\n*Try looking in the System Log: tail -f /var/log/system.logYou may find some interesting clues here.\n\nIf you find some process that is using a lot of system resources (CPU / Memory / Disk I/O, etc...), try killing it like this:\n# For example, if 'Google Chrome' is using too much memory, kill it:\nps auxww | grep -i 'google chrome' | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $2 }' | xargs kill\n# Kill a process by PID:\nkill 1234\n# Forcibly kill by PID:\nkill -9 1234\n\nLast Resort: kill WindowServer\nIf all else fails, and you're not sure what's really hung... you may want to try killing WindowServer.  This is a trick which I have used to solve the problem a couple times when all I see is a black background & SWoD.  Once you kill it, it should come back and dump you back to the login screen.\nSimply run:\nsudo killall -HUP WindowServer\n\n\nA: So I was Googling around trying to find an answer and something about this question was linked to an error I was seeing (not precisely sure what), but since I did actually conclusively track down my problem, I thought I'd offer a possible answer to the issue you're having:\nYou may have a process that's opening too many files. In my case it was a prefpane that decided to open thousands and thousands of files at once. You can track down which processes have the most open files with this command, which you can run in the terminal:\nlsof | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n\nThat will give you the process ID of the offending process, which you can then look up in ActivityMonitor. The tricky thing about this issue is that something opening up the maximum number of files can spike the CPU usage of applications other than the offending process as well as cause the BBOD and random crashes. In my case it was the NullRiver MediaLink prefpane and it was particularly affecting Chrome, but also Adobe Illustrator and Spotlight (inducing crashes in all three cases). It could be a completely different process or app causing the issue for you. All 3 of these affected programs open a lot of files themselves, so they were the most heavily affected by the OS saying \"Nope, can't open any more files, we're all out of file descriptors.\" Killing the prefpane and then updating it to the latest version resolved my issue permanently, but I needed the command above to track down the cause. Your description of what was happening almost exactly matches what was happening for me, so it's very possible that something opening too many files could have been the root cause for you as well. Since it's several years later, I'm going to assume this issue is no longer plaguing you, but other visitors from Google may find it helpful.\n\nA: Just fought through the problem of SBBOD or SWOD if you will, after startup on my 2006 macpro tower running is 10.6.8. Turns out, in my case, it had to do with IPv4 and IPv6 in the network settings panel and AirPort. The problem started when I switched from cable to fi-optics.  Apparently, the fi-optics modem is not ready for IPv6.\nGo into system preferences/network\nChoose the TCP/IP tab\nClick on the \"advanced\" button\nUse the configure IPv6 pull down menu and select \"off\"\nThis works in 10.6.8. Newer systems may vary a little, but the process is similar.\nHave not found this answer anywhere online. Hope this helps someone. Tried many of the other solutions, this is the only one that worked for me.\n\nA: To solve this, I figured that it must be something in my ongoing software that I use in the background that I hadn’t taken into account.\nI ran Activity Monitor, clicked on CPU and the %CPU column and discovered the culprit: MagicJack. I had never noticed before was the INSANE amount of System resources it gobbles up. In terms of %CPU the mjdev and the MagicJack app itself use upwards of 15-20 percent of CPU at all times it is plugged in and running! As soon as I quit MJ and disconnected it, guess what: no more beach ball, and things are running as snappy as in the Snow Leopard Days.\nMagicJack was hogging so much CPU time that the System had to wait its turn constantly, hence the Beach Ball.\n", "Q: Only 3 FPS on Mac mini, boot camp, windows 7 Using the GPU test tool from FurMark i get only 3 FPS. \nIn normal use I notice it when playing fullscreen videos: When the video pans horizontal i get these stripes across the picture.\nMy setup is like this:\nMac mini 2011 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5/ 2 GB DDR3 SDRAM (PC3-10600)/500 GB HD/Intel HD 3000/Thunderbolt\nOS: windows 7\nTv: Panasonic G10 50\" plasma\nTv and computer are connected with an 2 meter HDMI cable\nI've tried to change the HDMI cable - did not change anything.\nWhat can I try?\n\nA: Finally! - I worked out what the problem was. \nI had followed the speedup-tip:\n\nHead to the Control Panel's Performance Information and Tools section, and choose Adjust  Visual Effects.

Can someone tell me if this is fixable?\n\nA: Before you continue, make sure you read all of the links I have posted in this answer below. The most important link is this one, which indicates that:\n\nIf an iPhone or iPod has been damaged by liquid (for example, coffee\nor a soft drink), the service for such liquid damage is not covered by\nthe Apple one year limited warranty or an AppleCare Protection Plan\n(APP). iPhone and most iPod devices that were built after 2006 have\nbuilt-in Liquid Contact Indicators that will show (as described below)\nwhether the device has been in contact with water or a liquid\ncontaining water.\n\n\nThe Solution Everyone Does\nEveryone that I hear who drops their phone into water (either submerged into the toilet or onto their screen) does something like this:\n\nI immediately but the phone in a bag of rice for 4 days. When I took\nit out I tried to turn it on but nothing. Then I tried plugging it\ninto my computer and nothing happened as well. I left the phone plugged\ninto the computer for about half an hour then all of a sudden the\ncomputer recognized my phone. I then plugged my phone into an outlet\nand it made the charging sound. I thought my phone was going to be\nokay but then suddenly I realized that my screen was not coming on.\nYou have to turn the phone at a certain angle to see a part of\nthe screen. The strange part is the touchscreen still works.\n\nBottom line is, there is a 95% chance you won't be able to fix it. But try this, and you may be able to get it working at least partially. Make sure you take it an Apple Store first for advice. They may be able to let you replace it or at least charge a (somewhat) small fee.\nOther Important Information Regarding Water Sensors\nApple has water damage sensors in their phone and if it is completely submerged, they will not replace your phone (probably). Submerging it into alcohol (see below) WILL trigger these sensors. Also, if your phone was completely submerged, the sensors would have already triggered. See this for complete information.\nRisky Solutions\nI'm going to list some solutions you can try (at your own risk). These are from people who have had similar issues as yours.\n\nThe water probably has left some minerals behind that is stuck in\ncrevices, causing the instability. You'll want to wash out the\nresidue. Get isopropyl alcohol, nothing below 95%, if you can even get\n99% it would be best. Simply set your device into it completely\nsubmerged for 15 minutes. Set back into rice for a night or two. The\nalcohol will wash and push out the minerals left behind and the rice\nwill facilitate by absorbing it out.\n\nSource: iPhone Water Damaged Screen\n", "Q: Can I Boot VMWare or Parallels from an internal OS X hard drive?

They were great. When I added iCloud, it moved all my contacts out of Outlook and put them in iCloud. But now when I want to send a group email, my email (still using Outlook) can't find my groups anymore.\nI tried to make new groups in iCloud, and they seem to be there, but still are not found in Outlook. The old groups still show up in Contacts, but aren't apparently usable. I have them but can't get to them! Help! \n\nA: You might be facing the synchronization problem:\nMicrosoft chose not to support CalDav and CardDav in Outlook for Mac, unfortunately these are the services required by iCloud. \nAlthough MS did add these to Outlook for Windows they did not add them to Outlook for Mac.\nIn short you can't subscribe (not sync) to iCloud from Outlook for Mac (although you can if you use Outlook for Windows)\nUse Outlook, or use iCloud, not both.\n", "Q: Why is the symlink I created inside an application container to allow for external storage not working? I was trying to get around Vemedio's Instacast limitation on storage location by symlinking (ln -s) the Episodes folder in ~Library/Containers/com.vemedio.osx.Instacast/Data/Documents/Instacast to another location on another drive (which is actually internal in my Mac Pro for what it is worth...). I am wondering if Apple's sandboxing is preventing this to work... Once I open Instacast, none of the previously downloaded episodes are marked as available locally and if I try to redownload one, it seems to download the file in the background but never makes it available... Any idea?\n\nA: For some reason, symlinking a part of the folder inside of the Containers folder doesn't work. If you want to symlink, you have to symlink the whole folder, i.e. com.vemedio.osx.Instacast\nSee https://snipt.net/certainlyakey/os-x-sandboxed-apps-and-symlinks-problem-solution/ for reference.\n", "Q: Game Centre Apple ID help I just bought a new iPod Touch and I want to give my old iPod Touch to my child. He uses the same games that I do which I am logged into in the Game Center.\nIs there any way that I can keep the progress in the games that he has on his iPod now and for it not to affect the progress of my games on my new iPod? Or is it just best to give him his own Apple ID and he can start his progress all over again?\n\nA: You could set a new apple ID just for the game center for him (or you) and keep other apple-id logins the same for everything else.  It seems there are some games where the gamecenter only manages leaderboard stats, etc, and others where your actual game progress seems to be tied to the id.  \nBut on the other hand, problems will likely occur when using some games where your progress is going to sync to his device and vice-versa.  This seems like a worse option to me -- imagine this for a words with friends type of game.  And not sure what happens if you try to play each other.   \nSort of an opinion-based question, but I guess what I would do is look into it on a game-by-game basis and find out what exactly sync through the gamecenter account for the important ones, and if there's any way to simply temporarily move off gamecenter on one device for those apps (and then eventually tie it to another account?\nOr if it turns out there's only one or two apps that would be affected, one of you just bites the bullet.\n", "Q: Unknown email at iOS upgrade When I upgraded from iOS4 to iOS5 an unknown email address showed up as a possible email for me to set as one of my email accounts. Did anyone else have this problem? If so, where did it come from?\n\nA: Is it possible that someone had access to your phone and/or your Apple ID? If someone tries to sign into iMessage using another email address (even without having your password) it will show up as an unverified alternate email in your Apple ID.\nIf they also added that email to your iPhone's Mail.app they could reply to the verification email while on your device. All they would need then is to get your Apple ID password and they would have a validated account on your Apple ID. Then you would have an \"extra\" email account linked to your ID, even if they deleted the accounts off of the iPhone when they were done.\nBest thing to do is to check your account at http://appleid.apple.com, verify that there are no more unknown email addresses, then change your password!  Seriously! I saw this happen a lot when the upgrade from iOS 4 to iOS 5 first came out.\n\nA: I agree, the email had to have been associated with that Apple ID before the iOS upgrade, whether ladybird56 knew about it or not. I just tested Neigborhood_nerd's theory that a failed iMessage login does add an unverified email to your Apple ID and then either has a password prompt popup or it autosends a verification email to that address. If they knew her password it would be the work of just a few seconds to respond to the verification email. \nThe only reason I can see that it showed up after the upgrade was that iOS 5 was the update that was the major overhaul that allowed for all wireless updating. Some research shows that many people had what looked like a \"factory reset\" condition after that upgrade was done, i.e. http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1255766 \nIf that email address was associated with that apple id before the upgrade/reset, it will show up as an option to add as an email account during the setup process. Just like it would if she had gotten a new device.\n\nA: No, nobody else has reported this problem according to my search.\nAll OS upgrades are tested and this kind of major bug would have been detected, so it is certain that the OS upgrade would have not added a new email account.\nThe email would have been there before, you just didn't notice it until now.\n", "Q: Retina Nvidia Control Panel Settings for Gaming I've had a retina MBP for about a year now.

With Teleport (preferable, since it is already in my private ecosystem) or without it.\nUPD: Currently I'm just switching bluetooth on one device and switching it on on the other one. The only problem with this solution is that all my input devices are wireless, and thus I can not switch of bluetooth (MacOS just refuses to do that). So only for that purposes I've plugged in an USB mouse.  \n\nA: I solved this issue using a Griffin PowerMate (basically, a USB-wired button) and some AppleScript to switch Bluetooth off on the iMac, freeing up the keyboard and mouse so my MacBook (connected via TDM) could take over. \nIt's very smooth (as smooth as can be for something non-standard). I just connect my MacBook to the iMac, hit cmd+F2 on the keyboard, then tap the button to disable Bluetooth and let the MacBook take charge. When I'm finished, I just unhook TDM, close the MacBook and tap the button again to reconnect the keyboard and mouse to the iMac's Bluetooth.\nDetails here - hope it's useful to someone else: http://jamesholland.com/post/80600076762/hacking-mac-os-x-to-toggle-bluetooth-for-better-target\n", "Q: How can I listen to FM radio through my iPhone? My mom has an iPhone 4s. I have a iPhone 4. The radio is out of the house. She wants to listen to Garrison Keillor. Can we get radio through our iPhones?\n\nA: The iPhone doesn't have native FM radio support, but you can use the TuneIn app, which lets you stream your local radio broadcasts on your iPhone over Wi-Fi.\n\nA: iPhone does not have an FM or AM tuner so you would need an accessory to tune in an over the air broadcast.\nThat said, a lot of radio shows can be listened to through apps or podcasts. Specifically for A Prarie Home Companion, you can use the Public Radio Player app to find your local station and listen to the live stream. Note that this uses your phone's data connection, so if you are not connected to Wi-Fi, it will use data from your data plan with your wireless carrier.\nAlso, Minnesota Public Radio has it's own iOS app that plays most Prairie Home Companion broadcasts when they air in the normal central US time zone slot.\n", "Q: Is it possible to buy a legal third-party MacBook (Pro) charger? Apple owns the MagSafe patents - I realize this. On eBay, there are a ton of chargers, but no doubt of dubious origins. Are there any third party creators of chargers?\nIf a company wanted to create a new charger for the MacBook line, can they legally do so?\n\nA: I have long-term professional expertise regarding electrical safety.\nLegal power supplies have extensive and expensive certification and testing and manufacturing controls to ensure the user's safety.\nSome of the most safety sensitive aspects are:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Isolation Voltage - How high a voltage may exist between the computer electronics and the mains wiring without a breakdown occurring.\n\n*Leakage Current - How much current can flow through the power supply (and ultimately you) if you make contact with a grounded contact or even a live wire while you are contacting the computer electronics.\n\n*Fire or burns\nI will not claim that the \"knock-off\" supplies have NOT had the testing, but you decide for yourself if you think that Chinese manufactured supplies, even those bearing CE, UL, or CSA marks have actually passed or even been tested with the ultra-expensive tests and whether the manufacturing operation is well-controlled enough to guarantee that the product has not been modified.\nHow much would you spend to ensure that you or your child is not electrocuted?\n\nA: Apple does not license the MagSafe technology. So a company could not legally do so. You can read more about it over at Wikipedia. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe\nOn a side note: Apple has recently started allowing trade ins on old iphone/ipad chargers after a few aftermarket units have created some safety issues. \nhttp://www.apple.com/support/usbadapter-takeback/\n", "Q: How can I make iMovie delete videos from my iPhone after importing them? In iPhoto, after you import images you can tell it to delete the files off of your phone. Is there a way to do this in iMovie?\n\nA: I don't think you can, but you can delete them using Image Capture!\nImage Capture lives in your Applications folder and can show the contents of a camera (or your iPhone's camera roll) as a list, and you can manipulate it directly, including deleting some or all of it. I'd just pull up Image Capture after your import, and then sort by kind to isolate the movies, and delete the items you just imported.\n\nA: If the videos or photos are only in iMovie and not actually in iOS Photos (Camera Roll), you will be able to see those videos while you have any iMovie project open.\nJust open or create any iMovie project and hit the plus button to browse through the media.

It means the videos in camera roll are the ones in iMovie. But, if you want to keep all the imported videos, just upload them and save them to Google Photos. Then you can delete them from iMovie but you will not see all the imported videos in the camera roll.

Nevertheless, I can advance the progress bar to any point in the movie, but the screen just shows a still image of that point.\nThis is really strange since as far as I know, iTunes plays movies with QT.\nSo, what is the possible cause of this problem and how to fix it? Thanks in advance.\n\nMy environmental specs: OS X 10.8.4, iTunes 11.0.4 (4), QuickTime Player 10.2 (603.17).\n\nA: I suspect that the codec is the issue.

Just make sure you have the correct settings in Subler and Perian. \nI have Audio Output on Multi-Channel in both and AC-3 Audio to AAC is checked in Subler\n\nA: I had the same issue where an iTunes import/copy of an M4P file did not play. I exported from the QuickTime Player, using the \"iPad, iPhone 4 & Apple TV\" setting, and it successfully created a file that would play through Apple TV. (The estimated file size was way off however, actual export was much smaller and similar in size to the source, and the higher quality export option, \"iPad2, iPhone 5 & Apple TV\" was grayed out and not available.)\nThere's a good thread on this here: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=20884010\nThey talk about the issue being a 5.1 surround thing that iTunes does not handle. I'm not sure what the conversion did to the audio in my case, but I assume the conversion was lossy. See below for file info, original and conversions:\nMajor difference is that the original and iTunes converted files were .mp4, but the QT Player output a .m4v file that played in iTunes and my AppleTV.\nAll files (using get info) said they were: 720 × 404; AAC, H.264; 2 audio channels and 42:44 duration. Both MP4s (original and itunes import) were exactly the same byte count so it looks like iTunes copied and did not recompress the file, however the QT Player exported M4V file was slightly smaller in size, by about 100KB (for a 425MB file).\nI don't know where/how to view the deeper audio format information to find if any of the files had surround encoding.\nSoftware:\nMacOS X 10.9.5,\nAppleTV V 3,\nQT V. 10.3,\niTunes V.12.0.1.26\n\nA: Had the same problem. Apparently in a lot of cases it is just an issue of 5.1 Dolby audio which can't natively be handled by iTunes, but by QuickTime.\nI did a container conversion/repackaging with free MKVtools v2. (Don't get the latest)\nIt is pretty easy and fast, open the MKV in the converter, check \"Pass through video\" and \"Convert audio to 2ch\" and then there's even an extra option for iTunes/Apple TV settings.\nConversion takes about 2 minutes for a 1.5 GB 60 min movie.\n", "Q: How to enable Normal Scrolling on MacBookPro 10.8.3?

I accidentally left my iPhone 5 a few hours in direct sun and it overheated. Obviously I put it in shade to cool down but my question is will there be any significant damage? Long term? It was really hot when I found it.\n\nA: If you cooled it down, then the problem is resolved for now and there is nothing more you can do. Try to avoid doing that again as this will slowly move from the short term effects to long term ones.\nShort Term Effects of Overheating\n\n*\n\n*Battery decreases- fast! (Hopefully temporarily, when you cool it down, it will return to 98% of what it was before)\n\nLong Term Effects of Overheating\nWhen the iPhone overheats, Apple also claims that you might experience these (more extreme) results:\n\n*\n\n*device battery stops charging\n\n\n*display weakens\n\n\n*poor cellular signal.\nTo stop this from happening, try and turn your iPhone so that the screen is facing down. This will help it avoid contact with the sun. If you have a case, that will be better because the sun will be hitting the case instead of the phone directly.\n\nA: Starting at 40 Celsius (104 F) we think it is very hot. \nAt 50-60C (122 F-140 F) it is burning hot and we could not touch it.\nAbove that we actually get burned.\nSo you phone could have not been hotter then the outside temperature in the Sun (probably 40-45 C max if you live in Arizona).\nStill that is hot and could have impact on your battery life.\nPreventive methods are:\nUsing a white color phone housing.\nUsing the reflective phone housing.\nIn both case the temperature would be lower by as much as 10 C.

I just made a synchronization through iTunes of my iPhone onto my MacBookPro.\nFrom memory I made about ten modifications on my iPhone.\nUnfortunately they are not in the relevant group, but within All Contacts.\nI thought it will be natural to find them within the group Last Import.\nBut they aren't there.\nMoreover, on a total number of entries of about 600, more than 500 of\nthem are within this Last Import group.\nThis is a huge problem: where I'm expecting 10 entries to place in the right group, I'm facing a list of more than 500.\nWhat is the real usefull function of this Last Import group?\nWhat may I did wrong to get such a huge Last Import.\n\nI tried to simplify this huge problem by creating a New Smart Group… based on rule:\n\nCard was updated after Aug 15th 2013\n\nBut this smart group is still abnormal:\n73 cards where I'm expecting no more than 10.\n\nA: Last Import is a group that is expected to contain contacts acquired when you use the File > Import menu item. Since you modified existing contacts on your iPhone, your MBP does not see these contacts as imported, just modified.\nYour smart group creation sounds correct. It will locate any contact that has been modified by you or by another program, since the smart group rule is acting on the last modification date property of the person records. For example, if you use your iPhone to add a phone number to an existing contact, that contact has been modified indirectly (outside of the Contacts apps on OS X or iOS). Or if you send an email to a person, Mail might modify the record to change how the name or email address is displayed. Or when your contacts are synced through iCloud, there may be other non-visible changes to your contacts that force an update to the last modification date. So, unfortunately, a card was updated after (date) smart group does not strictly show you contacts that you edited directly, but instead it shows all modified contacts.\nHaving said all that, I don't have a better solution for you. I think you will need to use the card was updated after (date) smart group rule, and scan through that list of contacts to find the contacts of interest.\n", "Q: How to listen to my iPod on an other computer?

When attempting to restore my iPhone, it sometimes causes my computer screen to become distorted and freeze my computer.\nI'd been on iOS 5.1 (?) for a while (having put of updating it due to lack of space) and my brother suggested updating to the most recent iOS. I did this, but afterwards, my phone said it had to reset back to factory settings. I reset it, but when I went to restore my backup, I got the message “iTunes could not restore the iPod 'NAME' because the backup could not be saved on the computer.” Having looked around, people seemed to suggest that I needed to clear some disk space on my laptop. I've done this, and I have 217 GB free, so I can't see why this should be an issue now, but I'm still having the same problem.\nCan anyone suggest a solution? \n\nA: The simplest thing to do is to take your iPhone to a new computer and see if you can determine if the problem is the iPhone / OS on that device or the problem lies with your computer.\nAlso - you might check iTunes to be sure you have the old backup stored safely (perhaps backing up the computer itself) \niTunes places the backup files in the following places:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/  \n\n*Windows XP: \\Documents and Settings(username)\\Application Data\\Apple  Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\  \n\n*Windows Vista and Windows 7: \\Users(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\ \n\n\nOnce you know which of the two parties is not working correctly, you should be able to take your troubleshooting to the next step and consult the site here or Apple's support articles for how to proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/assistant/restore/\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/assistant/itunes/\n", "Q: Syncing iPhone 4S music only Will syncing iPhone delete existing photos on iPhone?

I'm pretty sure that was done correctly, as it worked fine for all accounts for about 9 months.  Then, the OS started renaming the volume on its own, usually adding \" 1\" to the volume name; thus, the OS couldn't find any of the home directories on that Firewire drive upon login, even though I could open the drive manually, and one would get a generic startup desktop, because the volume names didn't match.  I found that, using an admin account with a home directory on the startup disk, I could assign a fresh, new name to the Firewire drive, then get into each user's advanced settings, and re-point the OS at the user's home directory on the newly renamed attached drive.  That would work for a couple of days, until the OS again renamed the Firewire drive, and I'd have to repeat those steps.  Very annoying, and not something the other users, my family, are about to do.\nSo: why is the OS renaming that Firewire drive?\nSomewhat contemporaneously, I've had about 3 hard crashes (grey text screen) requiring a shutdown and startup.\nI've completely reinstalled the OS, BTW, which did not stop the disk-renaming.  Otherwise, I've seen no problems with said Firewire drive; I have another external USB drive for backups, and that doesn't have any problems of which I am aware.\n\nA: The problem comes from how OS X handles additional (non-startup) volumes. Say you have a volume named \"FWDisk\"; when OS X sees that, it mounts it at the unix path \"/Volumes/FWDisk\". If you put a user's home folder on it, the user's home path will be set to, say, \"/Volumes/FWDisk/Users/fred\". Fine so far.\nBut suppose fred logs in when the disk isn't connected (/mounted): the home path is still \"/Volumes/FWDisk/Users/fred\", which doesn't exist, so the OS creates it on the startup volume. You're working in a mostly-empty home folder without access to any of your files. So, you log out, and connect the external drive. What happens now is the mounter tries to mount it as \"/Volumes/FWDisk\", but discovers that that name is already in use, so it mounts it as \"/Volumes/FWDisk 1\" instead. This means that none of your users with home folders on that disk can find them -- they're looking for their homes at \"/Volumes/FWDisk/Users/whatever\", but they're actually at \"/Volumes/FWDisk 1/Users/whatever\". And it's going to stay that way forever unless you do something.\nThe solution is in 2 parts. First, to fix the immediate problem, you need to delete/rename/move that \"/Volumes/FWDisk\" folder that's preventing your external disk from mounting normally. You can do this logging out of all accounts with homes on that disk, logging into one with a home on your startup disk, unmounting the external disk. Then, use the Finder's Go To Folder feature (under the Go menu, or Command-Shift-G) to go to the hidden folder \"/Volumes\". Then rename or move the problem folder with the same name as your external disk. Remount the disk, and you should be back to normal.\nThe second part is figuring out what's causing the problem, or else it's just going to keep happening. This is going to be just a matter of paying attention to when the problem starts, and what leads up to it. Are you logging in when the external disk isn't attached? Is there something else triggering it? There's probably no reliable way to prevent it except for avoiding whatever event triggers it, so you need to find and avoid that trigger (/triggers).\n", "Q: How can I stream to Airplay and Bluetooth simultaneously?

I have a 200 GB iPhoto library. Using the tips from this website: http://james.wikidot.com/blog:69 I tried to delete all original photos on iPhoto that I don't need anymore. \nI ended up with a 130 GB iPhoto library... amazing, isn't it? Well... not really. \n\n\n*\n\n*10 % of my videos are just black (thumbnails and video data, everything is just black).\n\n*All photos that I rotated have broken thumbnails.\n\n*Some of the photos are broken.\n\n\nI'm getting my library back from time machine... but I was just wondering... Is there a safe way to delete all original photos from iPhoto and keep only the edited ones?\n\nA: CleanMyMac 2\nCleanMyMac 2 has an iPhoto Cleanup feature. It will scan your library and give you the ability to delete photos that have been cropped, resized, rotated, or otherwise edited.\nBy default, it will delete the photos that have been rotated and/or with fixed Red-Eye, however you can also choose to delete the originals of any photos that have been edited in any way.\n\nI have used this multiple times, and it's worked great, although it's worth noting that in the Rebuilding Library stage, it might appear that it's crashed, but it's still going - it does take a very long time!\n\nA: Just in case you want to reselect and delete photos from iPhoto, including the originals from the folder where they reside, I found a workaround. As you know emptying the trash in iPhoto does not delete the originals. For instance you can look at your photos and while you are doing it \"flag\" the ones you want to delete (see iPhoto's Menu-->Photos-->Flag Photo for a shortcut). Once you have \"flagged\" all the photos you want to delete, then go ahead and select them all (in the left hand column of the iPhoto window there is a \"Flagged\" icon, right above the \"Trash\" icon - click on it and you'll see al your flagged photos on the display window). Do a simple Edit-->Select All and then mouse-right-click on one of them and select \"Show File\". This will open a window with the folder where your originals are located, and in this case the ones you want to delete will be already and conveniently selected for you. Then simply go ahead and trash them with your mouse or with the \"Delete\" icon on the Toolbar and voilá!. (if the Toolbar is not showing then simply select from the Finder menu View-->Show Toolbar).

Apparently the firmware that's necessary to choose which partition to boot from won't act on holding down the Option key otherwise.\n\nA: I've had similar issues : while I was holding the key, the system would do as if if didn't recognize the keyboard(I'm on a iMac, with Bluetooth connection between the computer and the keyboard).\nOn the contrary, with a usb port keyboard, it worked anytime ! (but that wasn't practical to plug another keyboard)\nI understood that you have to be sure that the Bluetooth connects.

Doing it as soon as I heard the chime worked more reliably then holding it down before the chime even went off. I can't confirm that 100%, but it's worth a try if you're banging your head against the wall!\n\nA: i found my issue was the wireless keyboard, it wasn't connecting with the boot so computer would not respond to the option key. I first made sure the keyboard was on/active then booted the computer. \n\nA: I had the same problem that option key was not working.

To make it worse I can’t login to OS X either cause I haven’t used it for so long cause Windows runs great on a Mac that I forgot all my passwords.  The only way I got it to work was to remove the hard drive and after a few tries booting the laptop I was able to boot from Snow Leopard DVD and went into startup disk and set to boot from Snow Leopard DVD and restarted and powered it off and put my hard drive back in and from there was able to go back into startup and set to boot into BootCamp and am able to boot into Windows with no issues.  I still have issues with alt key but I just use Boot Camp Control Panel to select which one I want to boot and ok with that work around.\n\nA: I have an older Mac and I had the same issue.

Don't do this mid-project; allow yourself time to adjust.\n1: Yes, FCP can archive a connected camera. It produces the .fcparch file (which is actually a bundle containing all the original video files on your camera). Basically, the .fcarch file is a clone of the video parts of the card from your camera, is roughly the same size, and the FCP X Import window can read it just like a connected camera. See \"Create and Manage Camera Archives\" in FCP X help.\n2: If you want to backup your AVCHD camera to a NAS, just directly copy the PRIVATE folder you see at the root level of the camera card into its own folder on your NAS, which you could name after the card's number / reel number to distinguish it from all the other PRIVATE folders.\n", "Q: Change Users Home Directory I have created a new user but the new user's home directory has the old users path.

So, that is behaving correctly.\nI also note that actually plugging and unplugging headphones into the other end of the splitter doesn't register.\nI also check that audio output works correctly TRRS -> splitter -> my headphones.\nHowever, audio input does not behave correctly. System preferences -> Audio -> Input does not change when I plug and unplug the splitter (which has the Sennheiser ME3 attached). It states \"Internal microphone/Built-in\" regardless.\nI've also done a simple experiment to confirm that the MacBook is indeed receiving audio from the built-in microphone. I.e. it is completely ignoring the fact that the Sennheiser is attached. I did this by launching QuickTime and creating audio recording, then putting on the Sennheiser and counting \"123\" with my face next to the screen then \"456\" with my head as far from the screen as the cable permits. The first recording comes out much louder, so it is indeed using the internal microphone.\nHow can I get to take input from the Sennheiser?\nRelated questions:\nMacBook Pro (mid-2012) Microphone Input\nMacBook Air audio input/output, mic/headset\nRecommendations for headset (+ mic ) for macbook in 2012\nMacBook Air audio input/output, mic/headset\nPS If all else fails I will try another splitter.\n\nA: That TRRS socket actually has of odd configuration of 4 pins so that you can use the genuine Apple headphone/microphone all-in-one 4-pin combo that comes with iPods & iPhones etc. Generally they look like this: \n \nHere is your microphone, right? The Sennheiser ME3. Notice there is a locking ring on that plug? Also, notice how there are two little black lines on the end there? That is the insulation separating the 3 conductive contacts aka 3 pins This is a TRS plug: ( - )( + )(⏚).\n\nIt comes with the following caveats:\n\n1. The plug on your microphone has a rotating \"locking ring\", you have probably found that the microphone isn't working, or works only\n  sporadically depending on the connection. The issue is that locking\n  ring prevents the non-standard plug from fully engaging when plugging\n  into your sound card.\n2. Please note that all versions of the Sennheiser ME3 are wired differently than usual headset microphones and are not electrically\n  compatible with many computer sound cards.\n\nFirst of all, you're probably going to need something like this:\n\n\n3. Additional Note:  This adapter does not change the unusual wiring scheme used by Sennheiser in the manufacture of the ME3.  The ME3 is not compatible with all sound cards.  If you are having trouble, we recommend you interface your ME3 with an external USB sound adapter, such as the Andrea Pure Audio (MA) adapter, Buddy 7G or the SpeechWare MultiAdapter. \n\nI don't know what's up with the strange wiring scheme. Maybe it's a stereo microphone, maybe it has something to do with their noise cancellation feature, maybe they use some weird shielding in their cable, maybe they're using balanced cables, maybe they just decided to use an odd wiring scheme and call it a proprietary connector, preventing people from using aftermarket accessories, maybe it was an accident. I can only speculate without digging deeper or seeing a schematic or something. If it were me, I would probably cut the plug off and wire it in a traditional manner. Apparently though, these are compatible with the Sennheiser ME3. They are known as The Andrea Pure Audio USB-SA Adapter & The Andrea Pure Audio USB-MA Adapter, respectively.\n  \nIf by some miracle you have an ordinary connector, or you find a suitable line-level adapter to make things \"normal\", you're probably still going to want one of these;\n1/8\" TRRS male to 1/8\" TS female input & 1/8\" TRS female adapters:\nYes, it looks and sounds weird. The 4-conductor TRRS plug on this cable uses the CTIA standard configuration, which puts the microphone signal on the sleeve (versus being on the second ring in the OMTP standard). The CTIA standard has always been used by Apple and HTC, while older Samsung, Nokia & Sony Ericsson devices (for instance) initially used the OMTP standard.  \nPlug the 3.5mm (1/8\") male TRRS plug into the audio jack on your laptop.\nThe smaller of the two 3.5mm (1/8\") female jack bodies is the TRS stereo headphone output. Plug your standard earphones, headphones, speakers, or other output device into this jack.\nThe larger of the two 3.5mm (1/8\") female jack bodies is the TS mono microphone input. Plug your (hopefully, now) \"standard PC style microphone cable\" into this jack.\n\nA: I asked tech support at emicrophones.com and got the following super-helpful answer:\n\nUnfortunately, the MBA is looking for a line-in voltage, not a mic-in\n  voltage. There is no good way to directly connect a microphone to the\n  audio port on the MBA, you must go through a USB adapter. In theory,\n  you could use a pre-amp, but I haven’t seen one that has the right\n  connections and is portable and/or cost-effective. Something like this\n  might work, but I haven’t found a local source for them to test. You\n  would also lose the benefit of ADC algorithms specifically designed\n  for speech recognition if you use an internal sound card.\n\nEDIT: I have just discovered that plugging in a stock 3-band-plug Apple headset (such as http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MD827ZM/A/apple-earpods-with-remote-and-mic?fnode=49) does indeed get recognised as an external microphone.\nSo it cannot be as simple as \"TRRS Mic input is line level\"\nThis headset is obviously unpowered. Therefore somehow the MacBook's TRRS must have some way of determining what is plugged into it, and switching between powered / unpowered operation.\nAnd my Sennheiser ME3 is failing to trigger this switch.\n\nA: I following instructions from https://discussions.apple.com/message/22615803#22615803 I was able to connect an external microphone to my MB Air 2013 by pressing volume down button on my dr Dre headset. Unfortunately buttons on the headset doesn't work anymore.\n\nA: According to the page that you referenced for the mic, it states that:\n\nPlease note that all versions of the Sennheiser ME3 (sold here or\n  elsewhere) are wired differently than usual headset microphones and\n  are not electrically compatible with many computer sound cards\n\nThis explains the issue that you are experiencing.\nFurther, they go on to say:\n\nThis microphone is completely functional, however, when used in\n  conjunction with an Andrea USB sound adapter, the Buddy 6G or 7G USB\n  adapter, and the Andrea Pure Audio USB Adapter. We recommend\n  purchasing our \"ME3 combo\" (pictured above) for predictably great\n  results.\n\nI suggest getting the Andrea Pure Audio USB Adapter \nIs there a reason you need this splitter for a microphone?  I didn't get that from your description of the problem.\nEDIT:\nI noticed in one of the comments you said you didn't want to use up one of the USB ports.  Have a look at these USB Hubs by Anker.  I personally use these and I can attest to their customer service - their return and support policy is beyond fantastic.\n\nA: OK,\nyour Sennheiser has one cable/plug at the end. The connector is a standard 1/8\" (3.5mm).\nUnless you have the  Sennheiser ME3 Combo ( with USB adapter), that is different story.\nThat plug has microphone and headset in it.\nSticking that in a splitter to Mac wont do anything since you have nothing to plug in to the other hole!\nSo you have to first split the Sennheiser cable/plug in to two cables, Microphone and headset separate using a female to 2x male splitter for that.\nThen use the the two ends and plug them in to the Mac splitter, one for microphone and one for headset.\n", "Q: Time Machine backing up more data than I can physically have I have a Retina MBP with a 512 GB SSD. Today, Time Machine shows me this:\n\nDoes anybody know how Time Machine can be backing more data than I can fit on my hard disk? For what its worth, I still have about 40 GB free on the internal hard drive.\nTime Machine is setup on a 2TB Time Capsule.\n\nA: I'd say that the Info Window on your Hard Drive that you posted in the comments is completely correct. It uses the new base 10 system for calculating your Hard Drive space. \nI guess Time Machine is misreporting the amount of data backed up. This might be due to either Time Machine still using the old base 2 method for calculating HD space, or by Time Machine getting confused by the use of symlinks and adding up the size of some files multiple times.\nIt also could be that somehow the backed up data is bigger than the original data. This could be due to metadata, error recovery, or other factors. But I don't think this is the case, because the difference that you report is quite big.\n\nA: The 520 GB in your screen shot is just an estimate and since in some cases the estimate can be high somewhat substantially, you won't know if this is actually a problem until the backup completes. At that point you could use tmutil compare or a tool like Backuploupe to see the actual payload size for that specific backup and feel better about whether this is an issue with directory corruption or just an estimate algorithm that isn't highly accurate for your storage details.\n\nDue to how files are stored on drives, you could have a lot of files that fit efficiently on the SSD but end up wasting more space when they sit on a larger volume like the 2 TB Time Capsule so it could also be literally correct and no over estimate. HFS is fairly sophisticated on how it allocates blocks and stores files, but to simplify things - there is potential for huge inefficiency in file system storage.\nFor example, take this contact card I dragged onto my desktop:\n\nThe file size is 536 bytes, yet it takes well over 600% more space than needed since that one file takes up a 4 KB block of space on the filesystem. As the software is likely glossing over these details or making overly conservative estimates on how much slack space is going to be needed on the destination.\nMy experience is 20 GB of storage overhead is extremely unlikely so my hunch is it is an overly cautious estimate where the designers wanted to be \"better safe than sorry\" with making sure the actual backup used less space than estimated.\n\nA: Multiple sources confirm that Time Machine requires approximately 20-25% overhead space. Time Machine seems to be reporting a slightly lower figure than 20% over used space, but it's fairly close.\nI don't have an \"official\" source to point you to, but this figure is repeated over and over in the Apple Discussion Forums by reputable posters.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/22468774#22468774\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/9815174#9815174\n\nA: I have noticed in Mavericks that if a file e.g. a VM virtual disk is in use when Time Machine is backing up it seems to notice if that file changed during the backup and will try to back it up again but when it does it treats it as the same session so increases the total size of the backup reported for that session.\nI have a xGB of 70GB VM hard disk and, if in use during a backup, TimeMachine reports, over a period, xGB of 70GB then xGB of 140GB then xGB of 210GB... until I quit Parallels or the VM.\n", "Q: Closing applications after documents are closed- OS X 10.8 When I use applications such as TextEdit and Preview, the application still stays open after I close the text file or jpg file. When I click the respective application (since it is still in the dock), the application prompts me with a window to choose a file to Edit/Preview. Is there a way to configure these applications so that when I close the text file or the picture, the application itself closes and I can avoid seeing that window?\nFor instance, this is the window that I see for TextEdit after I open and close a txt file with TextEdit, and then open the TextEdit application on my dock:\n\n\nA: If you want to disable showing an iCloud-centric open dialog when you for example open TextEdit or Preview, you can either disable syncing documents and data from the iCloud preference pane, or use this unexposed preference:\ndefaults write -g NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile -bool true\n\nThere are some third party applications like RedQuits that make closing a window quit an application. RedQuits only applies to closing windows by pressing the close button though. There is a noticeable delay before it quits an application, and it doesn't support excluding applications like Mail.\n10.7 also added support for automatic termination, which as far as I know just means that applications that have no open windows are hidden from the Dock and the application switcher under certain conditions. If you for example open Preview, open at least one window in it, close all windows, and switch to another application, Preview is hidden from the Dock and the application switcher. The process is not actually terminated, but there might be some changes in how it is managed.\n\nA: Long answer: See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5268757/how-to-quit-cocoa-app-when-windows-close\nShort answer: It is a feature that is enabled/disabled by the programmer. It is not (usually) something that can be changed by a user.\n\nA: My question for you is how exactly are you closing the application? In the Windows world, closing the file, for example, a text file opened in Notepad, will close Notepad entirely. In the Mac world, this is not the case. Closing the file closes only the file, while the app stays opened. This has been the way of Macs since I can remember. \nCommand-Q will close the app entirely, and not only that, it will keep the state of the app intact. So, using TextEdit as an example, if you had three text documents opened, and you close TextEdit, those same documents will reopen next time you open the app. Clear as mud, huh?\n", "Q: Can't connect to some sites over VPN When I'm connected to my company's VPN, some websites won't load.

Just use the same software that you'd use for importing individual photos from a regular USB-connected camera. Also make sure to have your phone \"trust\" your computer by turning on the phone and selecting \"trust\" from the pop-up.\n\nOn OS X, you can use the built-in Image Capture utility (or iPhoto or Aperture if you have those).\n\nA: \nCan I just browse them in Windows Explorer on my iPhone? If not Windows Explorer, some App. If I could even get a list of Albums part of my dreams would come true.\n\nYes, as the posters above mentioned. You can also use a tool like iExplorer, which runs on both Mac and PC, to manage your photos selectively.

Instead of having two separate files, one for the SD version and another for the HD version of a movie or TV show, iTunes can \"bundle\" both versions under one single file entry, which is labeled as \"HD+SD\", and iTunes automatically chooses the \"right\" version of the file to use for a given situation (e.g. use the HD version when streaming to my Apple TV, and use the SD version when syncing to my 16 GB iPad mini because I have \"Prefer standard definition videos\" checked in the sync settings).  Here is a video describing this feature and how to use it.\nI am using HandBrake to do the encodes, using the \"Devices -> Universal\" preset for the SD encode, and the \"Devices -> Apple TV 3\" preset for the SD encode, and am using IDentify 2 to do the metadata taqging.  The problem comes when I attempt to add these files into iTunes.\nIn previous versions of iTunes this process was pretty straightforward: assuming that the HD+SD encodes are properly tagged with the same cnID (which mine definitely are, I checked), just select both the SD and HD encode in Finder, and drag+drop them onto iTunes, and it will automatically create an HD+SD entry for that movie/TV show/whatever.\nUnfortunately I can't seem to get this to work in iTunes 11.  If I drag both the HD and SD encodes onto iTunes, it results in only one of them getting copied.  (seems to be random, sometimes it's the SD version and sometimes it's the HD version)  If I then try and drag the other file in, it does not copy the file in nor does it create the HD+SD file entry.\niTunes 11 definitely still supports HD+SD files, as the ones that I added in previous versions of iTunes still work fine.  I just can't seem to figure out how to add these HD+SD files in iTunes 11, because the way I've been doing it up till now no longer appears to work.\n\nA: OK, after many many hours of experimentation, I've come up with a trick that (so far) seems to work.  Not sure if this is the best way of doing it, but here it is.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the \"Music\" section in iTunes (I know, this sounds counter-intuitive, but trust me), and create a new playlist.  I call mine \"New Movies Test Bed.\"  Set the View to List View (this makes it easier to work with, again just trust me).\n\n*Drag the SD version of your encoded media into the playlist you just created.  It should add the file and copy it to your iTunes media library like normal; however it won't show up as an HD+SD entry, since you obviously only copied in the SD version.\n\n*Now select the HD version of your file, and while holding down Alt (Option) drag it into the same iTunes playlist where you dragged the first file.  It should magically turn into an HD+SD entry; however it has not yet copied the second (HD) version of the file into your iTunes library (you can verify this by right-clicking and choosing 'Show in Finder\"; you should only see the SD version of the file in the window that appears.)\n\n*In iTunes, right click on the file you dragged in, choose \"Consolidate Files\" then click the \"Consolidate\" button in the dialog that appears.  You should see iTunes start copying the HD version of the file into your iTunes library.\n\n*Verify that both HD+SD versions are in your iTunes library by once again right-clicking and choosing \"Show in Finder.\"  You should see two files, one of which should be named \"Movie Name (1080p HD)\" (or presumably \"Movie Name (720p HD)\" if you did a 720p encode).\n\n*Finally, go to the Movies section (or TV Shows section if you're importing a TV show).  You should see one, and only one, entry for the file you just imported.\n\n", "Q: Display seconds in addition to hours and minutes on the Clock How would I go about getting the clock on my iPhone to display the seconds beside the minutes?\nI have looked at Settings → General → Date & Time, but it only allows me to choose a Time Zone, Set the clock automatically or toggle 24-Hour Time.\nIs there anything I can do to cause the clock to display seconds in addition to minutes and hours?\n\nA: If you look at the icon for the Clock app on your home screen it has a second hand.

This was happening from day 1. Now we are all realizing that it is happening to all our laptops. One of them simply stopped responding in usefull time (approx 15s to minimize a window). (I tave talked with my collegues and we all agree that these are the last Apple products we will buy)\nThe steps that reproduce the problem are as follows:\nclose the lid of the MBP, \nwait 15 seconds, \nopen the lid, \nwhen the screen shows the request password window start typing your password. \nafter normally 3 strokes (taking me 2 seconds to type) the laptop suddenly selects all my characters and whatever I continue to type it automatically substitutes my previous typing, obviously causing a bad password \nI have at home another MBP with the same hardware, with a disk three times as full but twice as fast.\nThis particular laptop has been to a certified Apple repair shop for a change of logic board totally unrelated to the issue as the problem was here before and persists after the change in logic board, and since the problem is present in 7 other laptops bought at the same time.

After a short period, I can access my music library (located on the iMac) and play songs from it. It will play fine for a song (or two), and then it just stops. \n(Remote app will typically display the song after the one that was just played, as if it was playing (the pause symbol is displayed) but there will be no \"progress\" indicator. Pressing pause does not have an effect. Skipping back/forth will change the song title/icon in Remote app, but nothing is played. After clicking around in Remote app, trying to restart the playback, sometimes playback starts again, sometimes the app terminates (I haven't found any patterns for what works here yet, it seems somewhat random). After restarting the Remote app and/or playing around in it for a while, I can make the playback restart, but it stops again and the process repeats.)\nI've read about various ports that need to be opened in the firewall etc., but I don't think any of these apply, as everything works fine for a while. AirPlay to the same Apple TV also works (for a while). There's no firewall enabled between any of the devices on the local wifi network.\nI'm starting to think this could be a problem with the Apple TV running without a TV/screen connected on the HDMI port, and that some kind of \"screen blanker\" or power save mode is triggered. \nNow, the questions: Does anyone know how to make the Apple TV run problem-free in headless mode (no TV/screen)? Is this even supported? Or would I be better off buying an AirPort Express and connect that to the DAC?\n\nA: I suspect your problem is the network, not the devices. The queue used when controlling the AppleTV from an iOS device is different from the queue on the native Music app (to see this yourself, note the empty queue in the AppleTV music app when you start music from your iPhone).\nSo, you have two dependent links (at some frequency, not necessarily constant):\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone to AppleTV, to update the queue, provide new information, etc.\n\n*AppleTV to iMac, to retrieve requested files\n\n\nCan you monitor the network links on these devices using your WAPs diagnostics features? Or, perhaps more usefully, using Wireshark or the like to promiscuously capture the conversations? I'm willing to bet there's some severance going on.\nRegarding running the AppleTV headless, I'm certain that's not the anticipated use of the device, but I'm not aware of any specific problems this could cause, unless it expects video signal via HDMI to keep alive, which you could test easily enough.\nHopefully, this is somewhat helpful in considering your problem. Good luck!\n\nA: I was never able to get this working reliably, so I gave up and bought an AirPort Express.\nAt first, it had many of the same issues when used as an AirPlay device only, connected to the old WiFi setup. When I instead connected it as a WiFi access point and replaced the old WiFi, I got rid of the issues and now it seems to work fine. As a bonus, the music now sounds much better (using the original 16 bit 44.1 kHz signal, not the sloppy upscaled 24 bit 48 kHz from the Apple TV). :-)\nSo, I guess the bottom line is that my old wireless router was not up to the task for some reason, and if you want reliable AirPlay, the safest is to try before you buy, or stick with Apples products.\n", "Q: Signing onto Shoprite Wifi causes Google to lock my account Shoprite is a chain of grocery stores in the Northeast. They now have a special iOS app where you can scan your own groceries as you shop. When you leave, you simply pay for what was already scanned and skip the checkout line.\nIn order to use the app, you must be logged into the Shoprite WiFi network. However, every time I do that, I get an immediate notification from Google that says\n\nGoogle Account xxxxxx Suspicious login detected. See google.com/blocked\n\nThe link goes to a webpage that says:\n\nWe blocked an application from signing in to your account\nWe recently denied a sign-in attempt from an application (like an email or chat client) or a mobile device because we weren’t sure it was really you. To prevent unauthorized access to your account, Google notifies you via email and/or SMS when we notice this type of suspicious sign-in attempt.\n\nAfter that, my Gmail account is locked, and I have to request a text message to unlock it.\nThis is really strange since my Shoprite account doesn't have anything to do with my Google account. I have seen absolutely nothing on the Internet about this, and neither Google or Shoprite seem able to tell me exactly what is going on.\nI have no idea why this is happening, and I thought maybe someone here can explain it to me. There are two explanations I can think of:\n\n*\n\n*Shoprite is attempting to access my Google account. They're a pretty big public company, and I can't imagine them surreptitiously doing something like this.\n\n*My iPhone is attempting to access my Gmail while on Shoprite's WiFi, but why would that matter to Google? I've connected to other WiFi networks around (Amtrak, Starbucks, Cablevision, etc.) and Google doesn't care about those. Besides, the app that's accessing my Gmail account would be my iPhone's Mail.app which has been setup to do just that.\n\nAny ideas what is going on?\n\nA: I have had similar issues with Google. I connect to Google services in the background from what Google sees as a \"new location\". So, when I sign in from what it deems as an unusual location, I see these entries in my Recent Activity :\n\nWhen I verify that it was me \"by clicking the \"Yes, that was me!\" button, the next time I connect, I no longer get the security notifications. This seems to remediate the issue, but it doesn't explain to me why I'm getting the notifications in the first place. (I haven't been able to track down an explanation, only a way to get rid of the notifications.)\n\nA: I've pinned this down to my iPhone accessing my Gmail account via the Mail.app. There are two separate Gmail accounts on my phone. However, the one getting locked was the one I had setup as a IMAP account. I did this to hide the fact it's a Gmail account. I use my own email address, and simply use Gmail as a back end.\nTurning off this IMAP account before accessing the Shoprite WiFi prevented the notice from Google, and after shopping and getting off the Shoprite WiFi, I was able to turn on my mail account without things being locked.\nSomething about the IMAP process and using Shoprite WiFi caused the issue. No other WiFi I've signed on have caused it. However, it is definitely the Mail.app accessing my Gmail account via IMAP that triggered it.\n", "Q: Mac OS X - File Open Dialog: Can't sort or resize columns I'm having a problem where when I go to File > Open; I can't resize the different columns. \n\n\nA: Set the arrange by mode to none:\n\n\n", "Q: Snow Leopard Server as a Parallels VM Basic question. I have a licensed copy of Snow Leopard Server, and I want to run it in Parallels 8 as a guest OS. Can this be done?\n\nA: Yes, you can run Snow Leopard and Leopard Server as a guest. You cannot, however, run Leopard or Snow Leopard NON-server OS as a guest, as it is prohibited via Apple's EULA.\nEDIT: See Parallels KB here.\n", "Q: Database app, accessible from Mac, iPad and Web I feel very out of my depth with this query, but not being able to do it isn't really an option so I am going to have to learn how one way or another.\nI have been tasked with building an application /  database for a Chauffeur company. I have done similar things before in Microsoft Access for other customers, hence getting this request, but this customer wants to be able to run the app on their Mac, and not install Windows. My only real experience of coding is HTML/CSS and some VBA when using Microsoft Access. For these Access DBs I have created separate front and back end files to allow multi user access and also remote access (the back end file being kept on the company server).\nSo onto my query (apologies for dragging it out)...\nI need to be able to build something that the single user can open and run on his Mac, so he can view, add, change jobs and their details. He also needs to have the same access on his iPad, although purely viewing would suffice. \nAs regards the web access, basically he wants to be able to go onto his \"Booking System\" application, go to \"New Job\" and send a link to his client, where they would click the link in a browser, fill in the details (Name, Contact Number, collection and drop off addresses, collection date and time etc...) and when they submit this form the details be updated on his booking system.\nMy issue is I do not really know where to start. What kind of database development environments are available on OS X (like MS Access is for Windows) which I could use as a starting point?\n\nA: Short answer, grab FileMaker Pro. The iPad app integrates nicely with the desktop, and it runs on both Windows and Mac.\nAdditionally, since you are comfortable with HTML, CSS, and VBA, you might want to try NSB/AppStudio, which can use PhoneGap to generate a native iOS or Android app. We've created several apps to be deployed in the field for such things as product catalogs, quality checklists, etc. and it works pretty well. \n", "Q: Upgrade from 10.5.8 to Mountain Lion Is it possible for me with a 2007 iMac running Leopard (2.16 Ghz Intel 2 Duo and 2 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM) to upgrade to Mountain Lion? If not, is there any later version I can upgrade to? If I can upgrade to Mountain Lion, do I need to install an earlier version first? And if so, how do I do this? \n\nA: Edit\nAs pointed out by Kent, an iMac with a 2.16 Ghz Intel 2 Duo seems to be like an iMac (Late 2006) instead of an iMac (Mid 2007).\nTechnical Specs for iMac (Late 2006)\nTechnical Specs for iMac (Late 2007)\nTherefore, you can only run Lion. Unfortunately, finding a legitimate copy of Lion could be a little tricky if you haven’t already purchased it.

His is and ipod classic while mine was a touch. \nWhen the battery started to run low I hooked it up to my computer. I have my itunes set to manually manage music but itunes immediately popped up when my computer recognized the ipod. It was giving me this message that was like it knew it wasn't my ipod and it was telling me I need to restore the ipod. Of course I freaked out and safely disconnected the ipod as soon as possible.\nAfter that the ipod was stuck on the \"ok to disconnect\" screen. I wasn't sure what to do so I let it die. I instead hooked it up to my car stereo in order to charge it. The stereo wouldn't read any music on the ipod when it was finally charged and it was still stuck on the same screen as before. \nDid I lose all of his music? Is there anything I can do to get it back to normal without having to give his ipod back? \nPlease help, I am desperate and not used to classics.\n\nA: Performing a hard reset may restore your friend's iPod to working order - doing it should not affect the music loaded onto the iPod. Apple provides instructions for doing this here. From the relevant section:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Toggle the Hold switch on and off. (Slide it to Hold, then turn it off again.)\n  \n*Press and hold the Menu and Center (Select) buttons simultaneously until the Apple logo appears, about 6 to 8 seconds. You may need to\n  repeat this step.\nTip: If you are having difficulty resetting your iPod, set it on a\n  flat surface. Make sure the finger pressing the Select button is not\n  touching any part of the click wheel. Also make sure that you are\n  pressing the Menu button toward the outside of the click wheel, and\n  not near the center.\nIf the above steps did not work, try connecting iPod to a power\n  adapter and plug the power adapter into an electrical outlet, or\n  connect iPod to your computer. Make sure the computer is turned on and\n  isn't set to go to sleep. Try resetting the iPod while it is connected\n  to power.\n\n", "Q: Powerpoint changes mission control desktops every time I focus on a window I'm trying to use PowerPoint on my Mac with Mountain Lion. I have a window that was originally opened in Desktop 1 and then I moved it to Desktop 4. Now, whenever I try to focus on the window in Desktop 4, it auto-switches back to Desktop 1, preventing me from actually doing anything in PowerPoint. The key here seems to be that I've turned off the System Preference in the Mission Control tab to switch to a tab with an open window when I switch to an application. When I check that box, everything works as expected. That's a horrible solution though.

During the installation process it came up with a weird looking error message, similar to the one in the next picture:\n\nI'm wondering what's causing this issue and what can I do in order to solve the problem. It's a bit hard for me, a veteran Windows user, to get along with this type of OS.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The error message \"Mac OS X Lion couldn't be install, because the disk Macintosh HD is damaged and can't be repaired.\" in the photo above would indicate that there is either a  problem with the physical hard drive of your Mac or the Mac's \"Macintosh HD\" volume is damaged at a software level.\nWhile you're in the installer you can click on Window > Installer Log to view a log from the Lion installer.  This may give you some clues as to what is causing the error.  For instance, any mention of \"Disk I/O Error\" would be an indicator that there is a communication problem with the hard drive at a hardware level.\nYou can also attempt to repair the Macintosh HD volume using Disk Utility (should be accessible from the Lion installer's Utility menu), or reformat it again if the repair fails.  Once repaired or reformatted you can attempt the installation again.\nHopefully that helps.\n", "Q: Unhide desktop icons I recently had tried to make some hidden desktop icons on my desktop following the instructions found here. I am on Mac OS X Mountain Lion. I ended up somehow making every file a hidden file. The files are all visible but are just transparent and I cannot open some of them. \nHow do I make all of these files become unhidden files so they are no longer transparent and I can access them better? \n\nA: You might have accidentally show the hidden files in Finder. Try this command to hide all the hidden files:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool NO\n\nTo show it again, change the BOOL value from NO to YES:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES\n\n\nA: To unhide all icons on the desktop, simply open the terminal then run:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop true\n\nThen restart Finder with the following command (also in the terminal):\nkillall Finder\n\nThe reverse is true if you'd like to reverse this and hide icons on your desktop:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop true\nkillall Finder\n\nHere's a video showing the effect this will have.\n\nA: Download a program called Clean Slate (free trial).
